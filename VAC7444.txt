"Step by Step" with- another work, it must be found in the fact that this volume, although not depend- ent on that for the intert and connection of the nar- rative, has naturally grown out of it. This, also, is a "Fireside Story," being pictures of life in some of its different phases at the present day, and laying no claim to the construction and elabora- tion of an artistic plot. It is hoped, however, that it possesses sufficient variety and incident, and truth to nature in its characters, to render it attractive to those, of whatever age, whqoio not care especially for extrava- gant and unusual experiences of life in fiction. Persons, whose culture and standing in the commu- nity entitle their opinions to confidence, have assured the author, that there is a large class of readers ready to give a cordial reception to such works as it is her aim to produce. With that class of readers she would be glad of an increasing acquaintance, should her books enton that for the intert and connection of the nar- ratve hs atraly ron  utofit    be considered worthy of a place in the family library, or of perusal in the home circle, while she returns grateful acknowledgments to'those friends who have bestowed such a generous measure'of commendation upon her first undertaking. DORCHESTER, September, 1857.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS. CHAPTER     1. "If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him." ONE Wbright morning, early in June, a bridal party en- tered that stately edifice, St. ----- Church, in the city of New York; and as they swept lup the aisle, the organ pealed forth in triumphal notes, ceasing only When. the white-robed priest took his place at the altar, book in hand, ready to perform the marriage ceremony. The bride was young and: handsome, with an air of worldly ease, which, together with her costly and fashl- ionable dress, bespoke at once her position in society. The bridegroom was also strikingly handsome, appar- ently some twenty years older than the lady, so soon to become his wife, and with the look and bearing of a self-satisfied man of the world. A little less confidence and assurance on the part of either would have added to the interest of the sacred occasion; but it was not until the minister in solemn tones, which indicated thamt he, at least, felt the ceremony to be no ordinary one, said 1   2       HERE AND HEREAFTER:  to the bride: "Clara, wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy estate of mtrimony? Wilt thou obey hilm, and serve him, love, honor, and keep him, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all others, keep tlfee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?"-it was only then- as if some faint realization of the true nature of the rite in which she was engaged had just flashed upon her - that her head drooped, or her dark flashing eyes were veiled by their lashes. Soon the ceremony was ended and the pageant swept- from the church, as it had entered, accompanied by the notes of the organ, ringing forth an unfaltering trium- phal peal. We will not follow the bride to her mother's, Mrs.  Grafton's elegant residence in Fifth, Avenue, where the reception was conducted after the most approved fashion of the times; nor upon the bridal tour, also made in conformity with the strictest rules of the mode; nor yet at present to their home in Boston; but rather turn to a similar scene occurring a day or two later in a beautiful rural town in the old Bay State. Here, also, the marriage rite was solemnized in church, and here, too, the organ lent its aid to the occasion; but it was in a low, sweet accompaniment to the softly fall- ing footsteps of the bridal company, entering the temple of the Lord with devout humility. They were not strikingly handsdole, either the bride or the bridegroom perhaps, although the former at least was very beautiful, as she stood before God's altar with the light of a holy purpose beambing from her dark blue eyes, now raised for an instant, as the fervid tones of her pastdr fell upon hor ear, and now veiled by her dark lashes, while her whole countenance was radiant with the sweet hopes of   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        3 a,trusting heart, which can be joyful since it rests secure on a love higher than an earthly. The very garments, too, wlich the bride wore, indi- cated what the manner of the spirit was which they adorned, so pure and beautiful were they;-a plain white tulle over white silk, a veil of the same soft airy material, with lilies of the valley drooping their modest bells and hiding in her hair and the folds of lace around her neck and sleeves. As for the bridegroom,--with far less of beauty than the bride, his face was one-to inspire confidence and win regard at once ; and to give the assurance, that his mar- riage vows, now so solemnly pronounced, would be kept in the spirit as well as to the letter. The -customs of the'church, of which these young persons were memlbers, did not admit of the use of the beautiful service in "The Book of Common Prayer," but of an abridged and modified form of that, thought to be more in harmony with the worship of descendants of Puritan ancestors; but its simplicity was the more effective, perhaps, on account of the deep personal inter- est felt by the pastor towards these disciples, who had been for some years lambs of his flock. One in belief and purpose they had entered God's house that bright June day, and one in name and heart Leslie and Delia Norton left it to commence a new chapter of life as a household here, with the sublime (and mysterious here- after as their aim and goal. Nature, clothed as she was in her freshest robe of liv- ing green, seemed to rejoice that day, and as the bright June sun sent his glad beams over hill and valley, and. shone upon the newly wedded pair, it appeared to fond, loving hearts, who were witnessing the scene, like God's own benediction upon his young servants. With the   4       HERE AND HEREAFTER: thoughts of their owii hearts at a season so sacred and holy, we will not attempt to intermeddle, but let their subsequent lives and characters declare with what pur- poses and aims. they set out together upon this period of their earthly existence. Perhaps the following' letter, written by a witness of both weddings to a friend in India, may not be uninter- esting to my readers. Rosedale, June, 185-. "This time, my dear Helen, you shall not complain of me, that I do not write you any news, having quite a budget to unfold,-- the most interesting items, of course, relating to marriage. Of course, I say, since you, the newly wedded, are bound to be interested, either from sympathy witl their misfortunes or joy at their bliss, in all your sex similarly tied, according as your experience of life matrimonial may have been; and I, being a can- didate for that same state, as an engaged young lady, am equally bound to consider such events very, very interesting indeed. "But to proceed to my news. Marriage number one took place in high life in St. Church between Clara Grafton and Mr. LeonardFitzroy, and was planned and conducted in accordance tith the most modern and ap- proved rules in all such matters made and provided. I confess I do pity poor Clara, for poor Clara she will find herself, I fear, before many years tied to that cold, selfish, worldly man, Leonard Fitzroywho has not, I verily believe, even the merit of loving her. He thinks she will grace his establishment and do honor to his taste; for I do not believe the man thinks there are any personal pronouns but I and mne and mine, -rather a scanty list to commence housekeeping upon, I fancy. You know I was- a good deal at the Graftons' during   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       5 the long sickness of the Judge; and I was really sur- prised to discover how much heart Clara actually had; and I was convinced. then, that if she married a man who would seek to give her elevated tastes, and correct some of her nonsensical notions about society and fash- ion and high life, she would make something of a woman yet; but now I have not much hope of her. With her education and her natural love of gayety, what is more probable tilan that her better feelings will all be extin- guished or suffered to become torpid, and she will seek her enjoyment in the whirl of excitement and pleasure? If she does not, she will sink down into a most wretched woman with a main who - but no matter. I am' really judging,-not righteous judgment surely, since I do not know Fitzroy well enough to pronounce upon his char- acter. But we shall see, and I have freed my mind. "You know, Helen, when you and my brother were married -l that very church, I told you that I never heard such an organ; as we stood almost spell-bound in listening to it then, it seemed to me to play out heart histories as if it knew all about tlem, commencing al- most sally, as it did, and then rising into notes of such serene cheerfulness, as if it said, 'You have suffered, but now you shall be happy.' I know Edmund said the piece was his own selection, and that accounted for its peculiar excellences. Well, I suppose Mr. Fitzroy did the same, for we had one grand burst of triumph; and how do you think it made me feel? Why just as if it said, ' All your hopes are placed here, so for a short life and a merry one.' "Now don't say, Helen, I am always having some such feeling whenever I attend a wedding which is con- ducted with a good deal of fashion and pomp, for I do not. When sweet Margaret Bellair was married, I said, 1  I/   6       H IlERE AND HEREAFTER:         I ' There's a heart under all that finery, and one that will make her home happy'; and I was right, too. No, I am not so unreasonable as I was in old' school days, and I have witnessed many an impressive and touching mar- riage in that same church, even when the bridal pair were among the so-called worldly and fashionable. "But to wedding number two, the details of which I know you are longing to hear. I delayed coming to Massachusetts, because I really wished to be present at Clara's marriage, and so I arriivd here only the evening previous to Delia's, and had but little time to ask all the impertinent questions I wished to; for you know we have not met face to face before for nearly a year, and since that time she and Leshe had become engaged. I did ask her, however, when that delightful elder brother and sister feeling between them, consequent upon their relative positions in her Aunt Leslie's family; clanged into another, I suppose I must say, a deeper and a holier one. But the saucy girl only shook her head and laughed, and said she could not tell, for she did not know, adding with some gravity and more naivete, 'It was very natural, you know.' "'But to the wedding,' I hear you exclaim; and now, indeed, I am at fault, because I am so 'feeling full,' as Miss Bremer has it. 'You know, Helen, how I love Delia; not so much for her natural gifts and at- tractions as for her noble self-victory, gained in those trying-years when, a proud and self-reliant girl, she was for a season exposed to such trials in her father's death and her own change of residence. How nobly she ac- quitted herself then, in the year she resided with her Aunt Grafton, where everything was so uncongenial to her\l What a comfort she has been to her Aunt Leslie in the six years which have intervened since she first t              t   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       7 - Y went into her family! But all these things you know as well as I. So it happened as she stood at the altar with her bridegroom, of whom it is enough to say that he is worthy of her love, I could not think of her merely as a beautiful young bride as pure and lovely as the white tulle and lilies which composed her dress, but I also thought of her as the brave, heroic spirit, which had fought against and conquered itself, and now fn sweet humility was well fitted to enter upon a new course of life. Others, I think, shared my feelings; and I do not know as I ever attended a wedding where so many hearts rejoiced in, the lhappiness of the wedded ones, and where the union was so universally approved. Of course, all the Leslie family, including the bridegroom's mother, are more than pleased with the connection. Mr. How- ard, whose health is evidently declining, looked as if he had obtained his heart's desire in giving his niece, whom he almost adores, to such a husband. What a noble man he is, Helen, and how I love him for all he has endured! "We, that is, Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Norton, Madam Norton, and your sister Adie, are all established at Rosedale, passing the honeymoon among the hills, smil- ing hills and valleys of this beautiful region. A little later in the season we are to go to the White Moun- tains; I say we,-for I am supposed to be a resident in this family for the summer; and as your mother kindly keeps watch and ward over mine, in her pleasant invalid retreat on the Hudson, I can be spared, - an arrange- ment which meets the entire approbation of a rising young merchant of our mutual acquaintance. 'How do we get on in our courtship?' I hear you asking. Mrs. Musgrave, the superior woman of this neighborhood, whose word is law, and whose fiat has been heretofore as that of the Medes and Persians to all   8    +   HERE AND HEREAFTER-: the country iound, says she is surprised that Mr Jtem- pie and Miss Lawton ever fell in love with each other;  there is so much similarity in our disposition and man- ners, she fears there will not be that harmonious blend- ing so requisite to perfect platrimonial felicity , imagine that dash to represent a long breath, my dear. Perhaps she is right. I could wish Melville had a little more of the pensive in his temperament and character, as I have none; but, entre nous, lie is a very good young man without it. T "Haste to the wedding! Helen, tell my good for nothing brother Edmund to wind up those horrid In- dian affairs and come home; for it seems, when the roses bloom again next year, another bride will merge her identity in that of another of the lords of crea- tion.       $  - s   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.    -    9 r CHAPTER II. "How sour sweet music is, When time is broke, and no proportion kept! So is it in the music of men's lives." - SHAKErSEARE. IN a handsome private parlor, in the Revere House in Boston, sat two ladies in elegant morning dresses ;- one with a piece of embroidery in her hand; the other list- lessly turning over the leaves of a book of engravings. It was not difficult to recognize in the former the recent  bride, Mrs. Fitzroy, but just returned from her bridal tour; and the lady with her was Miss Julia Delavan, one of her bridesmaids, and &o-called friend also. The bride's face was slightly clouded, as if the honey- moon was not all sweetness; and she occasionally cast an impatienitglance toward her silent companion. At length she said: "How dull you are, Julia! What's the use of mop- ing all the time. I declare, I wish I had taken Emily French with me, if you are going to be so melancholy all the time. Come, do put all this sentimental folly out of your head, and forget that such a person as the Rev. Edgar Manning exists." "Forget, Clara!" replied the young lady addressed, in a sentimental tone, and with a deprecatory uplifting of her soft white hand. "' Though the past haunt me as a spirit, yet I wish not to forget!' In remembrance is the only link that binds me to earth, torture though it be."   IV    '   HERE AND HEREAFTER:  "Come, Julia, your mother put you under our care, that this absurd folly of yours might be driven out of your head, and I mean to do my best for that object. Edgar Manning is poor; you are not rich, even in ex- pectancy; yet you have been educated in luxurious tastes and habits; how canl you expect to gratify them, in a retired country parsonage, upon six or eight hun- dred dollars a year?" "'Thou to me Art all things under heaven, all places thou.' Better love in the meanest hut with him, than misery in a palace." "If you are going to talk with me, Julia, please talk prose, not poetry, and sense, too, if you can. I'm plain matter of fact, you know Now, as to your mean- est hut, that's all nonsense. I know wlfat you expect: an elegant little Grace Church parsonage in the country, embowered in vines and -roses; two maids and a man servant; fruits and cream, eaten from silver and china; and the Rev. Edgar always sighing and cooing at your feet. That's your ideal. Now for the reality twelve or fifteen years hence: a small, ill-furnishedl house; one poor servant; six, eight, or ten children; six or eight or ten hindred to live on; and the Rev. Edgar, gray, thin, wri'aed, bent with care, worn, and   sometimes ner- vous - otherwise cross ; and yourself- " "O Clara, how can you talk so!  Spare me such a picture, and I 'll spare you poetry as well as I may, since I see you cannot enter into those finer feelings of the heart, which ignore all petty cares and trivial vexa- tions." "Finer fiddlesticks! - Julia, did you ever happen to meet the Rev. Cyrus Morridge at his rich brother's hlouse in Lafayette Place?"       ,  ' l    -:.:     OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        " "Yes, I remember to have seen him." a Well,- there's an illustration for you. Six children and six hundred dollars a year; and his wife, I know you saw her, too; her hands didn't look much like yours, Julia." The young lady' glanced anxiously at her hands, which were her special vanity, and said: "It's all very well for you to talk, Clara, who have secured the very best match of the season. You know all the girls have been dying for Fitzroy, season after season; and no wonder, he's so handsome,--as hand- some as Edgar, only'he has not such an interestingly pensive expression. I wonder how you came to be so lucky." "No such great luck for me," was the reply of Clara, tossing her head, and surveying her really handsome face and figure in the mirror opposite. Fitzroy knew I didn't care for him, and so naturally he took it into his head to care for me. I would n't have married him after all, only I saw what a fool Maria with, all her high notions made of herself, by marrying that beggarly Frenchman, who has nothing but his ancestors and his title, which we democrats don't care a fig for,Ito live upon." "Well, how do they get along?" "O, they live in a small house, in an out of the way street, principally upon pride, and Maria's property. ThWgirl's a queer child; she's five years old only, and gives herself the airs of a couptess, at least. I can't  abide the child or her father either; and Maria and 1 never got on together at home." "Is Mr. Lascelles really as high-born  as it was said? " "Yes, I believe so; but he's no business talent, Mr.   12      HERE AND HEREAFTER: Fitzroy says, and withal so rash, he's likely any time to sink all Maria's property, if she's been fool enough to let him have it. You know when father died we all had our share, as he left no will. Lucky for us that he didn't or it would all have gone to the missionaries, I dare say. Now, Julia, I tell you what it is, Maria is miserable enough I am sure, though she 's too proud to own it, and half because she lives so meanly. Now, you- take warning by her, and whatever you do, don't marry a poor manl,especially, don't marry a poor country minister. There, you have my mind." "I don't see why you have such a contemptuous opinion of ministers, Clara." "I have n't except for husbands. I have perception enough to see,fthat some people are very happy in that situation, despite its privations, but not such people as you and I are, Julia. I have always thought," added Clara gravely, " since my father changed so much after my brothler Fred's death, and was so happy in his last long sickness, and looked so heavenly on his death-bed, that there must be a reality in the religion we hear so much about; and perhaps some day when I am older I shall know something of it by experience, and I sup- pose those persons who really are #eligious have some- thing to sustain them and make them happy, which we have not; for I don't know a more cheerful couple than Mr. and Mrs. Morridge, for all their privations and pov- erty; but I say, that for those who are worldly in their tastes and habits as we are, Julia, I can't imagine a more wretched life than to marry a clergyman. Maria's would be a paradise to it. Why, Mr. Fitzroy!" she exclaimed, wi th a sudden change of tone, as that gen- tleman entered the robin. "You are home early to- day."  \ \   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       13 "Yes, Clara," replied the gentleman addressed, "I 've just learned through Rollins, that there ' a fine commodious mansion to be bought or rented at N  which is a convenient distance from the city, so I came up to say that we will go out and look at the place this morning."  "But I am expecting Delia to call, Mr. Fitzroy; I told her in my note I would certainly be at home to see her." "Mrs. Norton?" inquired Mr. Fitzroy, with a slightly contemptuous inflection in his voice. "Yes, and I should be very sorry to lose her visit. Can we not go this afternoon as well? I was particular to tell her to come in the morning., as I knew you liked driving out in the afternoon." ' I have left my business, Mrs. Fitzroy, at some in- convenience, and I suppose Mrs. Norton can call again, if she finds you out to-day, as probably her time is no morp occupied than is that of other ladies. The carriage -will be here in half an hour; will you be ready? This request, savoring, as it did, somewhat of a com- mand, for a three weeks' bridegroom, was indifferently assented to by Clara,who, besides really wishing to see her cousin,.was disinclined\to a ride into the country at that hour, since it involved a change of dess and some e ertion. Hwever, fond as she was of having her own way, she had already, in the fast waning honeymoon, caught a glimpse of the "married man's eye," and heard a tone of his voice which rendered the result of a contest with him doubtful. In her heart, Clara Fitzroy felt that she had at last found a ihaster, and did not altogether rejoice in the discovery, after the manner of some heroines of the pres6nt day.  But,   "      HERE -AND HEREAFTER:         A however that might be, she smoothed her brow and ar. ranged her dress, and was ready to accompany her hus- tand and Julia at the appointed hour, and soon the trio were in the cars, being rapidly whirled to their place of destination. The house was found to be a really desirable one, having been built only two years, and with all the mod- ern improvements, and having extensive and well laid out grounds.  "' Rollins told me that Norton lives somewhere in this neighborhood, Mrs. Fitzroy; so, if we decide to take the house, you can see as' much as you like of your cousin. By the way, I was not aware before to-day that you were so very fond of her," said Mr. Fitzroy, as they stood looking out upon the pleasant country residences in the neighborhood. "I am not so very fond of Delia," replied the young bride with some spirit," but she is my cousin, and I am among strangers, and I should like to see her. I wish," she added, "I was very fond of her, it would be better for me I dare say." "Mrs. Fitzroy as humility!" replied her husband in a tone of mock reverence. "Really, Clara, you de- velop some new characteristic every day. Soon I shall not know you as the lady I married." "I have heard, Mr. Fitzroy, that somnpersons possess the power of drawing out qualities in another hitherto latent, - perhaps such a gift is yours!" "In that event, I should hope to be able to develop lady, and beg yo to understand that I wish my w m ife to consider herself at least the equal of Mrs. Leslie Norton." This was said in apparently a playf ul manner on both sides, but a not very keen observer iould have detected    OR, THE HTW LTARS.       15 a " paining jar " as the under rote in the tones of eachll, and any one who had observed the young wife quickly turn away from her hlusband, with an unmistakable flash in her eyes, would have seen that she was really e vexed. In a few minutes, however, she was interested in examining the house. Opelling a door, which led out of a dressing-room into a small apartment with a deep bay-window, she exclaimed: " O what a lovely morning- roomthis will make, Jtlia!  I shall furnish it witlh rose-colred draperies, and have a carpet of green leaves and rose-buds. There in that, recess I witl have a large nirror, here my work-table, and in that window an easy-chair and centre-table, and a curtain to close it in when I wish. I shall put all my charming-little gifts here, that I don't want in the drawing-room. Won't it be lovely?" And so she passed from room to room, her momentary ill-temper dispelled; and as, in her views about needful alterations, and with regard to furniture, she agreed with her husband, he was very gracious, and foxr a time, at least, they appeared a happy married pair. On theirreturn to the station, Clara looked admir- ingly out upon the pleasant scenery and   the elegant lesidences, expressing her admiration in the hyperboli- cal terms in vogue with young ladies of fashion, while her friend Julia reclined. languidly in he carriage, oc- casionally addressing a remark to Mr. Fitzroy, but for the most part in   "a maiden meditation," not "fancy free,"-- thinking probably about the Rev. Edgar.  At length she was aroused by Clara's exclaiming: "Look, Julia! do look!   Of all the lovely, heavenly places, that is the sweetest. Roses, roses everywhere. And see that gem oft a  house on the rising there, and those magnificent  elms.  O, can you tell me, Mr.   16       HERE AND HEREAFTER: Fitzroy, who lives there? Somebody I shall visit, I hope." t  a I don't know certainly, but I think from Rollins's description it must be Norton's place," taking out, as he spoke, his watch. "Q, let 's stop there for a few moments! Do tell the driver to. There, he's passed the avenue. Won't you have him stop, Mr. Fitzroy?" ' Impossible, Mrs. Fitzroy; I must be back to my business," was the somewhat decided answer. "Be- sides, I don't know that it is Norton's place; and very - likely they are out at this hour." "Just as you please, sir," replied Clara, angrily; "it is of no consequence, of course." And throwing herself back in the carriage, she did not speak again, excepting in monosyllables, until their arrival at their hotel, while Mr. Fitzroy exerted himself 'to play the agreeable to Miss Delavan. At dinner, how- ever, which they took in a private apartment with a family of Mr. Fitzroy's friends, she was again the radi- ant and elegantly-dressed lady, and he the handsome and agreeable gentleman. And thus they maintained the reputation they had acquired as the fashionable and elegant Mr. and Mrs. Fitzroy from Nr York; for Mr. Fitzroy had engaged in business in Boston only a short time previous to his marriage. Late in the afternoon they went out on a drive, and the attention the young bride attracted as she was handed into the carriage, and as they drove slowly through the city, was sufficient to satisfy Mr. Fitzroy that he had really married a wife whose appearance in public did him honor, as anian of taste and judgment; and with this reflection, he was gallant and almost ten- der, and even went so far as to say to Clara on their   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       17 return, "Upon my word, Mrs. Fitzroy, you are looking very handsome to-day, --I am quite proud of you," at which she laughed; for the time as well pleased as a loving heart would have been with a sincere expression of affection.  Music from Julia, who was a proficient in the bravura style of performance, and conversation, or talking with visitors, supper at a late hour, ended one of Clara Fitzroy's first days in her new home. Her comment upon which to Julia, as they sat together for a few minutes in the room  of the latter, was, "I'm tired to death. What intolerable bores these Boston people are, -so stiff and unsocial, and so conceited too -and then they dress so like frights! I shall never buy a hat, or have a dress made here, that's certain. O dear, I wish I could have seen Delia!" 2* "V    18       HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER      III. What seasoned first the vessel, keeps the taste." To those of my readers who in "Step by Step" traced the disciplinary events of the early youth of Delia Ar- lington, which resulted in the formation of a consistent Christian character, no recapitulation is here required; but -to those who have not, a few words of explanation may render the present story more intelligible. Left an orphan at the early age of fourteen, heiress to great wealth and under the guardianship of her mater- nal uncle, Mr. Howard, she resided by her father's wish one year with his sister, Mrs. Grafton, in New York city, and one year with her mother's sister, Mrs. Leslie in R   , in Massachusetts, at the expiration of which period, she chose to make her permanent home with the latter. Under the fostering care and kindly influence of her aunt and uncle, and in the society of a number of cousins, she spent that portion of her life which inter- vened between girlhood and marriage, loving and be- loved, conferring and receiving happiness. There also she became acquainted with her future husband, Leslie Norton, who with his mother found a home in his Uncle Leslie's family. The vows of disci- pleship to Christ, which she had taken at the early age of sixteen, had influenced her character and actions in that dangerous and trying period to the young, when they first are released from the wholesome restraints of early youth, and enjoy, with a zest never after to be ex-   OR, TH TWO ALTARS.        19 perienced, life's rainbow pleasures. Consequently, when she left school, she did not leave her studies also, but still devoted some portion of her time daily to them. When Delia by public profession had become a mem- ber of the visible Church of Christ, she, did not consider that act itself a saving one, but rather what her Saviour required of her, and as means providentially appointed, and in some way fraught with divine grace, whereby she might be peculiarly helped to enter into the king- dom of heaven; and then she began to realize, with the earnestness of an ardent, conscientious nature, her re- sponsibilities, and strive to fulfil them. And she found abundant opportunity for the' exercise of the Christian virtues and graces, favored child of fortune although she was. The feeble health of Mrs. Leslie, rendering her niece's assistance invaluable 'to her, interest in her cousins, and care for: them, all with a single exception younger than herself, the calls of charity which present themselves in every community, laid upon her duties, which she did not refuse to fulfil; and though positive duties, they were performed in a spirit and manner that made them positive pleasures. As to the rest, she en- joyed society and the innocent recreations natural to her age and sex,' with a keenness known only to those who to the buoyant spirits and eager life of youth add the serene peacefulness and deep joy of an abiding Christian faith.' To look upon two such young persons in- their fresh wedded joy, at the time when the coldest hearts feel a momentary glow for them, and when kind ones throb in love and sympathy, and desire that Heaven's choicest blessings may be showered down upon their path, how earnest is the prayer of friendship and affection, that the unknown future may be merciful, and, as its Al   20       HERE AND HEREAFTER: ever lengthening vista opens out to their view, it may disclose only joy and happiness! Many such prayers were offered up in devout gratitude in behalf of Leslie and Delia Norton, even while experience declared that they could not be fully realized. IBt O mysterious and oftentimes dreaded future! whatever of sorrow or sadness thou hast in keeping for those united hearts, thou hast nothing in all thy dark catalogute which has not been appointed or per- mitted by our Heavenly Father. With this knowledge we will follow our pilgrims here a little way on their journey towards the nobler joys of the hereafter. A lovely place Rosedale certainly was, whether viewed in respect to its natural advantages, or the taste every- where evident in the buildings and grounds. Thee spot selected by Mr. Howard and his niece for her future home was the site Iof al old picturesque farm- house, which stood in a dilapidated condition on the hillside, with its graceful drooping elms in front, and its long well-sweep on the. side, while a little in the rear a thick wood of maples and birches had been suffered t remain. The old house was taken down, and a ne  one erected a little farther back from the road, so E to adniit of a winding avenue in place of the straight path grown over with grass, which an- swered for the former owners. As the present man- sion stood, the lawn, the avenue, and the elms were in front, while on one side on a rich interval of land bloomed the flower-garden, now fragrant and smiling with roses of every hue, having been transplanted the previous season with great care; on the other side was a fine, flourishing vegetable-garden, to which access was obtained through a shrubbery and continuation of   ORj THE TWO ALTARS.       21 I the lawn, where were also growing many beautiful S shade-trees, at some distance from the house. Within doors everything was comfortable, conven- ient, and in some apartments elegant, without any of that gorgeous magnificence and. extravagant display so common in such country residences. On the second floor all the rooms opened into a wide hall, and on one side the whole suit connected with each other. From one of the larger apartments opened a smaller one, some twelve feet square, lighted by a single window in a deep recess. This Delia dedicated to her own private use, --the altar of her home it might be con- sidere'd; for one glance sufficed to show that it was a consecrated spot. Its only furniture was a couch and two chairs with white coverings, a small, round old-fashioned table, one of the relies of her early home, over which hung an exquisite engraving of the Ma- donna with the Holy Child clasped to her breast,.while upon the table lay a large Bible, evidently also an heirloom, a smaller one, and two or three volumes of devotional poetry and hymns. An inkstand and port- folio upon the table, a small bookcase with a choice collection of books, mostly of a serious character, com- pleted its arrangements. It evidently was not a work- room, nor such a morning-room   as is often seen in the houses of the wealthy,-where light labor and lighter gossip while away so many hours of the day; but it was, as it has been said, a consecrated spot, - a morn- ing and an evening retreat,-in-lthe best and holiest sense, a place for communion with one's self and one's Maker, - the altar at which the Most High was wor- shipped in secret. We may not intrude into thiploliest of holies, while our young bride is there in her first morning hour,   22,      HERE AND HEREAFTER: the sun pouring his grateful light over hill and valley, the birds singing and warbling their praises, aAd the flowers giving forth their sweetest perfulre and all nature rejoicing in tihe new glory of a nelay; but we may look upon her face as she leaves it, and goes down into her pleasant breakfast-room, and, opening the glass door, steps out upon the broad piazza; and while we so look, we may conclude that she, like the birds and flowers, has been making her purest and best offerings to the Universal Father. So too, per- haps, thinks Adie Lawton, who comes up the walk to meet her, and whose light, jesting word, which rises  to her lips, is changed into the simple articulation, Delia." "Well, and what then?" was the smiling ansver. "Nothing, only I was thinking-no matter what, now, for here comes Leslie to say that time and cars wait not for bridegrooms even in their honeymoon; and Mrs. Norton stands at the window looking-well, ,not dissatisfied with her son, nor, most wonderful to relate, his wife." "If time and cars wait for no man, some men wait for the cars a most unconscionable period," said another voice, whose familiar accents caused a blush upon Adie's cheek. Immediately recovering herself, however, she turned, and, with a deep courtesy, said: "To what unexpected event do we owe the pleasure of your company, Mr. Temple?" "To my determination to prove to Miss Lawton that I could rise with the sun. I was to have come out in the early train.; but some detention occurred, and here I am, just in time to eat my breakfast and whirl back again to my accounts."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       23 The pleasant meal which followed was enlivened by cheerful conversation, and at its conclusion the family adjourn to the library for morning devotions. These did not apper to be mere lip service, but the fervent offerings of grateful hearts; for all seemed to join in the simple, earnest devotion of the young head of the house, Leslie, whose distinct, impressive reading of the Scriptures, and short, fervid appeal to the throne of heavenly grace, touched the hearts of all. As Adie was leaving the library, Melville laid his hand on her arm to detain her; and in the few moments' conversation which ensued, it appeared that both put aside the manner which, under abrupt plainness on his part, and light badinage on hers, hid so much deep feel- ing. When they separated, it was with a laughing injunction from Adie to be more careful of detentions another time that he wished to prove his adherence to good resolutions, and a rejoinder from him to Delia to take good care of that saucy girl, and not allow her too much freedom of the tongue in his absence. The gentlemen now took leave, and the ladies went each to her own duties. An hour later, Delia and Adie met in the garden, when the latter said: "What do you think, Delia, brought Melville out this morning?" "To see his lady love, I presume. What else should?" replied Delia, laughing. "No indeed, not entirely, by any means. Do you know, he says that Julia Delavan's clerical lover, the Rev. Edgar Manning, has followed hel' to Boston, and he is afriiid that the said Rev. Edgar will rashy engage himself to her, which, he says, will be misery to both." "Well, what can we do, Adie?" "O, I don't know; only 'Melville, knowing that we   24       HERE AND HEREAFTER: were to call upon Clara to-day, thought that I might say something in my impudent way to add fuel to the flame in the breast of the very susceptible young lady. But he need n't have been afraid, I should n't have done any such thing. Youknow Melville and Edgar are good friends, and, naturally enough, Melville feels that he cannot bear the thought of his'lhrowing himself away." - "Clara will do all she can to prevent it, Adie, as she knows it will be a poor match for her friend in a worldly point of view. But I don't see as we can do anything. /  There is mother. Now, Adie, for our books and work till it is time to dress for the city." And sitting down in their pleasant upper hall, one read while the other sewed; and thus they passed the morning hours previous to going into the city. The result of their visit to Mrs. Fitzroy was, of course, not to find the ladies at home. So, somewhat surprised, they returned to quiet, cheerful dinner, and an after- noon of alternate reading, sewing, walking in the gar- den, and receiving visitors. Among the visitors was Mrs. Musgrave. When she left, Adie, throwing herself upon a lounge, said: "De- liver me from your superior women. Now I dare say Mrs. Musgrave would be shocked to hear me say it, but, for the life of me, I can't help feeling and sa y- hing it too, that I like that quiet, reserved little Mrs. Carter fifty times better than such superior women as everybody calls Mrs. Musgrave. In -the first place, I believe Mrs. Carter hlas a great deal of character and principle too, although she-is not for ever talking about either. Mrs. Musgrave is constantly saying that such and such a person has very little character; or it would not be consistent with my principles to do so and so. Let people act their character and their principles, o    OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       25 and not be all the time talking about them. I beg your pardon, Mr. Norton, I was not aware that you had come home, or I would n't have been caught trans- gressing the rules of the house in discussing our neigh- bors," --starting to her-feet, and making a low mock reverence as she spoke to Leslie, who stood in the door- way. "But you must allow me that grace, at least, to give a piece of my mind about that superior woman." "I believe," said the gentleman addressed, smiling, "that we must always allow what we can't help; but you remember the compact was, that we should seek diligently for the good in our neighbors. rather than to make too great account of anything bad we find in them. I believe Mrs. Musgrave, the subject of your not very complimentary criticism, has some sterling qualities despite her superiority, which so tries your patience." "Well, I can't help it if she has. I slall never see them, while she makes such a parade of her virtues; and though I don't like to tell tales out of school, I^ don't believe our model housewife, Delia, likes her one bit better than I do. When, just now, she was inti- mating to your beloved how great her responsibilities were, in view of her position and wealth, I could see a little of the old, haughty, not-to-be-dictated-to spirit flash out of her eye, and her head almost take the old proud erectness," "You naughty. girl, Adie, to be looking just where you had no business to," said Delia. "But if I am to 'be brought to the confessional, I will make a clean breast of it at once, and acknowledge that I was not altogether pleased witl[CMrs. Musgrave's manner of speaking, but I was not aware that I was making such an evident exhibition of my feelings. I quite agree 3   26       HERE AND HEREAFTER: with you with regard to Mrs. Carter, - she impresses me as a lady who has a great deal of latent power, un- known to herself even, as well as to others." "She is unfortunate, I understand, in her domestic relations. Her husband is a cold, stern man of the world, having little sympathy with her or her pursuits," Leslie replied. "But what have you to say of Mrs. Harris, Leslie?" asked Adie mischievously. "O, she's amiable and pretty and- " "And weak and frivolous, perhaps; but I 'll try and see only the amiable part when I am wint her. You really are charitable, Leslie, and I think your plan much preferable to mine,-and," she added, sighing, "far more productive of happiness." "You may be sure it is so," added Leslie kindly. "I have seen many of the lovely of your sex, and the manly of mine, whose influence and characters have suffered not a little on account of this one habit of looking for defects in their neighbors, rather than virtues; and I early determined to cultivate in myself the opposite habit, for it is one that needs to be pretty generally cul- tivated, being of indigenous growth to very few natures, I fear. We have come to our home in this beautiful region," he added warmly, " where both nature and art have done much,-- so much, it appears to me, that it would be ungrateful to be on the constant- lookout to discover what is a blot here and a defect there in the landscape. So with regard to our neighbors, among whom we hope - do we not, Delia? - to live and die in peace and good-will ";- a radiant smile from the young wife now seated at his side was the only reply;-- , we know many of them to possess good and noble traits of character, and upon them let us look. I grant you,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.         27 there are some persons whose faults and weaknesses are so glaring, that it is difficult not to notice them on first acquaintance, and I allow also, that I wish Mrs. Mus- grave's superiority was less felt by herself, and Mrs. Harris's frivolity was a little less apparent; but upon the supposition, Adie, that we ourselves have faults as well as our neighbors, why, then let us judge as we would be judged." "You would echo Burns, and say, ' Then gently scan your brother man, Still gentler sister woman; Though they may gang a kennin' wrang, To step aside is human? ' He had need enough for such a plea surely.' "Rather would I say with our own Whittier," Leslie replied:             'l I But by all thy nature' weakness, Hidden faults and follies known, Be thou in rebuking e il Conscious of thine own.' " "Or better still," said Delia, " the Scripture rebuke, which -I often think of, when disposed to find fault with others: And why beholdest thou the mote that is in - thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?' " "That decides the question," said Leslie. "The New Testament is an. infallible authority in all such matters. Now, Adie, having read you this little lecture, of which we all stand daily and hourly in need, show your good- will to me, and give us \a tune or a song before tea. After that, we are to have a drive; and I should not be surprised if certain young gentlemen made their ap- pearance here this evening. So, my lady of Rosedale," turning to Delia please to order your strawherries and cream for the odcifsion." '  !          \ -   28       HERE AND HEREAFTER: "For whom?" asked Delia and looked Adie. "Melville Temple and Howard'Leslie I overheard plotting a descent upon our peaceful dominions this evening, with a view to the crimson fruit and its accom-r paniments." "Selfish creatures!" exclaimed Adie. "We'll retire, Delia, and let them enjoy their feast by themselves, if that's their object.' "We shall see," said Leslie mischievously. "Now for the song, and then for tea; for I've a good rustic appetite." The song and the pleasant meal that followed- which, Leshe said, was the best of the day, because earned by labor--being over, they started on their drive. Their road took them by pleasant homes and smiling valleys to the Falls, where lived the manufacturing population of the town. "I have recently invested some money here, Delia," said Leslie, " and you, when your present play-day is over, will come here and look after these people. There is not much want nor suffering among them at present, I presume; but, as you can see, there is abundant room for improvement and amelioration." "Yes," interrupted Adie, " plenty of dirty faces for our bride to wash, and tangled heads to smooth and -" At that moment the sound of a woman's voice fell on their ears, saying, "Out of that, Bill, or I 'll break yer head "-" viragos to tame. Q, I'm so glad, Delia, I 'm not ower gude ; nobody 'll ever expect me to be the Lady Bountiful of any place." "How you do like to abuse yourself, Adie!" said' Delia; "but you shall come here to-morrow with me. There's a poor woman here, sister to my Susan, who is sick, and I'm to bring her some broth and jelly."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       29 "Just like the Lady Bountifuls in approved novels. You 'll do, Delia, only you must take a flannel waistcoat tOO.'" '"In June?" asked Leslie. "Yes, for an invalid. If I go, I shall carry good advice, and soap and towels tod, fol the whole commu- nity." Their drive was prolonged a little farther amid the beautiful scenery of the Charles River, and they re- turned hoine to find Melville and Howard Leslie await- ing them. A"A most civil reception, truly, sister mine!" said Howard, as, forestalling Leslie, he handed his cousin from the carriage. "Go into the parlor, and see whom you have treated so cavalierly,' and, with gentle force, he pushed her along.  "Why, Uncle Howard! this is indeed a surprise. How glad I am to see you again! And you won't go away from me any more. But when did you come from Buffalo?" "Only this afternoon I arrived in Boston, and I've come to stay with you if you 'll give me a home, Delia." "That we will, with all our hearts, will we not, Les- lie?" "And feel ourselves greatly honored in doing it, my dear sir," answered Leslie, cordially shaking hands with his guest. "Delia speaks of you so often, and I know she feels, that it is the only thing wanting to her here to have you with us. You know we have an Uncle Ho'ward's room." "I know it, my children, I know it. Upon returning to Buffalo, I found my heart was no longer in my old pur- suits, but my thoughts would constantly wander away where my birdie had found her peaceful nest, and so 3 k   30       HERE AND HEREAFTER: I finished up at once what little business I had to do, and am with you for the little time my lapnp has to burn; and when it goes out, the event must not sad- den this blissful home; for you well know I long to be at rest." Bent, and pallid, and feeble, but with an expression which enforced the truth of his words, Mr. Howard sat among them, the beloved and revered relative and friend, whom all delighted to honorLand listened to the cheerful conversation and music; and, having joined in their familydevotions, at an early hour retired to his own room. Delia, entering with him, gaid, "Dear Uncle Edward, Leshe was right; I did need you here to complete my happiness, --you my friend always, for so many years my father." "Yes, so I felt, Delia, in my solitude. I thouight if your young heart went out to me with a tenth part of the longing that mine did to you, I must, come to you, without delay. I did not wish to burden your early married life with too many cares, but I knew it, would not be for long; alid here I ,would lay me down to die, - here where the religion I so long despised, but learned at last to value as the pearl of great price, is practised under the household roof. Bless you, my child,-and you will be blessed. They who, in the ful- ness of their wedded joy, forgot not to praise and thank the Lord,-are blessed in FHimn, whatever their carthly lot. Good night, my darling! I must pet you to the last, if you are Leslie's." "But still and ever your child, dear Uncle f;ward." An hour after, the moon shed her soft light over Rose- dale, where the lamps were now extinguished, and the peaceful household slept within, as nature did without.   OR, THE TWO BALARS.        31 CHAPTER IV. "Nothing is sure that growes on earthly ground, And who most truste in Arme of fleshy might, Doth soonest fall in disaventrous fight." - SPENSER. To the superficial observer, and one accustomed to regard cities only as hotheds of vice and fosterers of the darker passions of the human heart, the beautiful town of N--   looks like a paradisiacal abode, where only the gentler virtues and the holier emotions of our nature are found. The varied prospect of upland and valley, pretty villages with their elegant princely private dwellings, and busy manufacturing settlements; of the Charles River winding its way so coquettishy back and forth as to reverse the ordinary meaning of words; its fine public buildings, and its lofty sentinel keeping watch and ward over all, looking down upon a min- iature lake in the dark forest below,-all this of natural and artificial beauty impresses the thoughtful beholder with the feeling that, if "Art is mighty, Nature is the work of a mightier power than man." But 1e human heart, that mystery of mysteries, does not always respond to the beautiful without, and does not always keep itself pure and undefiled. What dissipated lives are sometimes lived, what vile practices and horrible crimes are sometimes perpe- trated, by those whose early youth had been passed in the midst of. Nature's purest and loveliest, scenery:! Here, as elsewhere, envy and vanity, detractiqt: and   3      HERE AND HEREAFTER: malignity, hold dominion. Many a picturesque cottage- roof covers not only aching, but ambitious and tortured hearts. Many a fair abode hides evil-doers and trans- gressors, whose way is hard. One evening, about -the period of the commencement of this story, upon the hill which is alike a resort to strangers and the delight of the native-born inhabitants, a young man might have been seen walking restlessly to and fro, with an eye so dark and a pall of gloom so heavy upon his countenance, that it was evident enough that he neither enjoyed nor beheld the lovely panorama at his feet. Occasionally he muttered a few words to himself, but for the most part he was silent, and gave vent to his thoughts only in the contortion of his hand- some and regular features. After a while, he appeared as though a resolution, which had cost him no little struggle, was taken, for a look of fierce determination settled on his face, and, descending the hill with the utmost speed of foot, he walked about a mile and en- tered a small, unpainted house, meeting on his way a young girl as handsome as himself, and far more attrac- tive, for there was a pensive sweetness in her expression very winning. "Where's father, Annie? I want to see him," said the young man.   "In his own room, James; but I would n't go to him, -he is very busy." "No matter if he is; I shall see him, by , I ve made up my mind to it; and if I catch him counting over his hoards, so much the better for miy purpose. I 'll see who's the stronger." "O don't, James, don't, I beg of you don't! he will be so angry." "Let me pass, I say.  Annie, I tell you I'm desper-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       33 ate; do not, by your foolish interference, drive me to anger with the only being on earth I love." ' Passing his sister hastily, he threw open the door of a small back bedroom, where he found his father, an old man, thin and spare and wrinkled, bending over a small trunk and eagerly clutching in his bony fingers some papers. Hearing the noise of the opening door he turned quickly, closing at the same moment the lid of ; the trunk, which he held with a convulsive grasp.  "Well sir, well, what do you want here?" -he asked, his voice trembling with rage. "Only my rights, father, - some of that gold, which I heard just now clinking in that trunk, or one of those notes, just as you like, sir. One or the other I must have, and that this very day,--yes sir, this very hour, -or I'm a ruined man, and you are disgraced in your only son. Do you hear, sir, I've been living (fn my employers long enough; and to-morrow, if I do not refund the  money I've abstracted, why then I 'm ruined, I say, and you are disgraced." "Well, sir spendthrift, what's that to me? Who has ruined you?" ' You, sir!" was the reply, in a tone so fierce that the old man released for a second his hold of the trunk, which slid out of his hands, and'the lid opened, and papers old and musty, and others fresh and fair, and gold, silver, and copper coins rolled out upon the floor. The son started forward to snatch some of the gold, when his father said, in an undertone' so determined and relentless that the excited young man shuddered and drew back: ; If you touch but a single one of those pieces, I 'll alarm the neighbors," -raising as he spoke a small side window, and pointing to some laborers a short distance off in the field. /  '    34      HERE AND HEREAFTER:         A Doggedly the young man drew back, and, turning to f entreaty, said: "Give it to me, father, do give it to me, or I 'm lost; and my poor sister,- O, it will kill her!  it will kill her!"    '  "Not one penny if you go to   . I've got no money for spendthrifts. Have n't you any more feeling than to come in this way and break in upon your poor X old father?"  "Think, father, how kind my employers have been  to me! - think, father, how I was tempted! I never  knew what pleasure was at home, and when I went into  the midst of it, I couldn't resist the temptation. O ;1 father, think of all this, and help me out of this trouble,  and I will never, never get so involved again."  i;j "How did you get involved this time?" inquired the  old man, but with not a shade of relenting either in : pmanner or tone. "First I went to the theatre, then I wanted fine  clothes, then I gambled to pay for them, then I lost, then I drank to drown my losses, then I played again,  then I lost again, and again, and again." "Got drunk, sir. Yes sir, I know it all, a drunkard  and a gambler, and come to me for money! you 're a 1i dutiPl son! Well, sir, I tell you again, not a single II penny of my money shall go to cover up your vices. What right have you to have vices? I never had any; : I could n't afford it; I had n't the money. I'm a poor man; you know I'm a poor man. Does this house, deo  these clothes, look as though I had money? I tell you,  I'm a poor man. Go to your employers, tell them what you have been doing, tell them how you 've been tempted. Perhaps. your story will move them; but it  can't move me. Go to Mr. Norton; if he can build  such a fine house, he can lend you money."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       35 "O father! don't drive me to distraction. Mr. Nor- ton has been so kind to me, has tried so hard to keep me from evil, how can I go to him? and how can you wish me to do it?" "Go away, I 've got something else to do but talk to a spendthrift." "WlWhere shall I go, father?" "Just where you like, it's all the same to me. Go away, I tell you, and never let me see you again in this room; go, go, I say. I'm poor, I tell you. Poor, do you understand? I never was tempted, it's too ex- pensive, only when I married your mother; but she was thrifty, very thrifty. You and Annie have always been Ni a burden to me; you've always cost me money. Go, go away, I tell you." And rising from his seat he menaced his son with his long bony fingers, and cast upon him a look of defiance and contempt. The latter retreated before his father with disgust, and went out, almost overthrowing his sister in his haste, who was kneeling outside the door. "You here, Annie?" he exclaimed. "You turned a spy upon your brother's actions? I did not expect this from you, Annie." "James, it was for your good I have heard so much. O James," continued the poor girl, sobbing, "let me go to Mr. Norton or Mrs. Norton, and tell them all you could not say, -tell them how we have lived here,- what a generous but proud and fiery spirit you always had. Let me go, James! I must, I will." James Clarke was too miserable to offer any resistance to the purpose of his sister, and in five minutes more she was on her way to Rosedale. When she was fairly gone he tried to recall her, but, fleet of foot and impelled by love and fear, she was already out of the hearing of   36       HERE AND HEREAFTER: his voice. Returning into the dingy little solitary room, he threw himself upon the hard oaken settle and buried his face in his hands, saying to himself;: "To be dis- graced in his eyes, who has been- so kind to me, who has held out to me every inducement to do right, who has invited me to his house, and has always treated me as civilly as if I was a gentleman like himself. O, I have it in my heart to curse my father!"And as he spoke he ground his teeth and clenched his hands with impo- tent fury. Meantime, his sister, with beating heart and flying "speed, pursued her way to Mr. Norton's; and it was not until she had arrived at the entrance of the avenue, that she bethought herself that she did not know the exact nature of her errand, or precisely for what she was to intercede in behalf of her brother. For an instant she thought she would turn back; but the remembrance of her brother's despair, and hef knowledge of his quick, impulsive disposition, made her tremble at the conse- quences of any delay. While she was still hesitating, she saw at a short distance from her, in one of the walks, an elderly and a young lady. Summoning up her cour- age she advanced towards them, and in a trembling voice asked for Mr. Norton. "He has not returned from the city," answered De-' lia, compassionately and wonderingly. "Can I do any- thing for you, or will you wait?" "O, I can't wait! I must have advice, or it will be too late. Can-I see you alone, ma'am?"  Certainly!" and Delia led the way at once to the library, where, closing the door, she sat down and said, kindly, "Now tell me your trouble." "O Mrs. Norton! I am Annie Clarke, and my brother is one of the clerks in your husband's employment."   "Yes, I remember yesterday Mr. Norton spoke of your brother; said he did not appear well. Is he sick? Is that your trouble?"  " no, ma'am, that is not it. James has done very, very wrong. He has taken some monoy, which did not belong to him, and he wanted my father to let him have some to replace it, but my father could n't, he was so poor; and I believe the money was your husband's, ma'am; but indeed I don't know rightly about it. I listened at the door, I was so frightened for James, or I should not have known at all, and now I don't know enough to tell you.  But O Mrs. Norton! if you knew all, you would not blame James so very much." In all this confused, incoherent address, Delia was somewhat puzzled to make out the young girl's mean- ing; but she gathered enough to infer that James Plarke had taken his employers' money, and she looked so grave that poor Annie, hitherto undecided how to defend her brother, being unwilling to say anything to the disparagemenft of her father, determined now to tell the whole truth, trusting to what she felt to be the genuine goodness of Mrs. Norton,--and she broke out again with "I will tell you all, Mrs. Norton, and then you I cannot blame James so very much, I know you can't. Our father is not poor really, but he is--very close with his money. Ever since mother died, who used to earn money herself, and buy clothes and nice things for herself and us, we have had a very hard life of it, Jarmes and me, though I did n't want to complain. But it is hard for poor James, who is very generous and proud and lively and high-spirited.  My father gave James education enough to fit him for a clerk, 4   38      HERE AND HEREAFTER:      ,   X and got him a place in a store when he was too young, X j i  and where he had hard work to do; but he did n't t : mind that, I think, he was so glad to get away from !l  home.  A year ago he got the situation with Mr.? Norton, and I was so glad. But before that, he had made bad acquaintances, as Mr. Wallis, his first master, ! never had an eye on Iis clerks, James said: and now, when he had more salary, he indulged more in pleas- ; ures. Indeed, ma'am, you would n't look so very  grave, if you only knew how very little pleasure he  ever got at home."                  "I am sorry, not grave, Annie,".said Delia, kindly.  "Well, I knew James was going wrong, and I tried to persuade him to open his heart to me, for lie loves - me, ma'am, but I could n't do it. He said there were ! things not fit for his innocent sister to hear. That a; made me feel so bad, that ie, so near of an age, and X so happy together when mother lived, should now be I so far apart. But to-night I was determined to know X all, so I listened and I heard him say, that he had  been drunk and gambled again and again and he plead with my father, O, so hard! but it was no use, i no use; and if I have told you all these dreadful  things about my home for no use too, what shall I I: do? O, what shall I do?" "Be comforted, my poor girl. I know Mr. Norton ;: will do what he can that is right for your brother,  and indeed I am not displeased, only very sorry for ;i! you all. I hear Mr. Norton's voice, and I will go and : speak with him. Wait here till I Teturnl."  ,  l In about a quarter of an hour, which seemed end- . less to the poor waiting girl, Delia returned with a A note in her hand. Giving it to Annie, she said: "You X: may read it if you wish, perhaps it will lend you X strength to get home."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        39 She opened it and read:--"Come to me at once, James, with the assurance, that I was never more disposed than at the present time to be your friend. Do not let any false pride or false shame keep you away. I think I can assist you in this crisis. "Yours in sincerity, I. LESLIE NORTON." With brightening eyes, and beaming, grateful looks, Annie took the paper, and was soon at her brother's side. To give him the note and speak of the kind- ness with which she had been received, bring his hat, and almost push him out of the door, was the- work of- a moment. And then she sat down to think of what she had done; and as she did so, the red blood rushed through her veins like fire, and lighted up her pale cheeks with a burning glow. She, so retiring, so timid naturally, to have been so bold; but her beating heart told her it had been in a good cause; and as she dwelt on Mrs. Norton's kind, sympathizing face, she felt reassured again, and, rising, she made the needful prep- arations for their frugal meal, to -which, when com- pleted, she summoned her father. "Annie, set away that white loaf for breakfast. Don't you -know we are poor, very poor?" Mechanically Annie obeyed him. Slhe herself lhad no , appetite, and she well knew her brother would have none. When the meal was over, her father said again: "Put away the bread and dishes; if James is not home to his supper, never save him any; he knows the rules. Then go to bed, child; you don't need a lamp these long days." Theo duteous Annie busied herself in obeying her father, with the exception, that, instead of retiring, she  40       HERE AND HEREAFTER:         [! sat and waited for her brother, who did not return until : quite late in the evening. As soon as she heard the  sound of his voice, she was sured that all was right.  4 I am saved this time, Annie ; Mr. Norton has been  most kind and generous. He will himself repay the   money, and make all right with Mr. Carter about it, : whose severity I dread ; and I am tot pay him out of my v salary, as it becomes due. And then he talked to me so - faithfully, and yet so pleasantly! I shall be a villain if I do wrong or fall into temptation again."      : And James Clarke really thought he never should go l astray again; and he was sincere in his determination ! i of amendment. But, alas for him! as for many another :i young man like him, he thought he was strong where he was weak. He relied upon himself, always an uncertain  reed to lean upon; in his case particularly so, such lhad  been the unjust privations of his early youth, and such i was his pleasure-loving, quick, impulsive temperament. v But his trusting sister had all confidence in him; she was i! quite sure he was safe now. Poor girl! she knew little *r of life, and less of the fiery ordeals through whichl her brother must pass in daily meeting its trials and temp- tations; and so she found peace again, and retired to her hard bed with a lighter heart than she had carried for months, and was soon in that quiet sleep which :i comes to the innocent and, trusting; for trust was a i large element in her disposition, although as yet she knew not Him in whom alone perfect trust is found. After Mr. Norton's interview with James Clarke, I which took place in the library, he walked out on the  piazza upon which the drawing-room opened, where he was soon joined by his wife, who was anxious to learn  the-result.                ,      "I have assisted him and promised to talk with Mr.  ,      2[   OR, THE TWO ALTARB.       41 Carter, of whom lhe stands in great fear, on the coll- ditiol that he abandons his vicious associates, and with- draws himself from all the social influences that have led him into temptation. But I shall keep an eye upon him without his knowing it; for I foresee that it will be no easy task for him to adhere to his good reso- lutions. And, Delia, would you not like to notice his sister? I have heard before what an uncomfortable home they'lhave witlt their miserly father, and James is evidently greatly attached to her. If you elevate her, it wfll be an indirect means of benefiting him, and of inducing!him to visit us. There is a great deal that we can do here, my love, and if we are faithful to our duties as Christians, a great deal which we shall under- take to do. I believe the popular notion is, that we who have wealth, and fine country-houses, live in luxu- rious idleness and selfish ease." "Too many do, perhaps, Leslie; and even we might do the same, had we not by our early discipline had our eyes opened to our responsibilities. There is a great deal more thoughtlessness than unkindness in the neg- lect of the rich to aid, as they should, the poor and erring. I shall be very thankful to do anything I qan for Annie Clarke. You don't know how my heart went out to her, as she plead with me so simply and trusting- ly for her brother, and it will be giving me something to do at once. Do you know, sir, I was beginning to be homesick for my little duties at Aunt Leslie's. You know I was so useful there, and here in this nice houese, with everything about it so painfully neat, I really am tired of doing nothing. Mrs. Musgrave shocked Adie the other day by asking me to join their Benevolent So- ciety, and I shocked her still more by first inquiring what its objects were, and then saying I would. Adie 4*   42       HERE AND HEREAFTER:  has a prejudice against ladies' societies, you know. But this will be better still, for it is very evident that be- nevolence, either public or private, will never reach a ' case like Amlie's."  ' And it is well that it should not, since, though M such societies are admirable for certain objects, they i should never take the place of a direct personal interest in those who are the objects of our care or charities." i "Will you not advise me, Leslie, what to do for Annie?" "No, my love; your own woman's perceptions of what will be best, are a safer guide for you than I could ever be. You have been taught in too good a school for me to presume to instruct you. See her and make   ' your plans, and then we will talk them over together. Meantime, whatsoever our hands find to do, we will do it with our might, will we not, Delia?" "I want nothing more, Leslie, and small merit in me too, for I love to be busy." "But come, most inhospitable of hosts and hostesses, have you not yet finished your obneymoon speeches? if not, it's high time they were broken in upon by so . complete a romance-destroyer as myself," interrupted Adie Lawton, making her appearance at one of the win- dows of the drawing-room. Delia made some playful rejoinder, and went in with her friend, Leslie soon following. During the conversation that ensued, Madam Norton ? made some inquiries respecting Mrs. Carter, the wife of Leslie's partner, to wh9m allusion has been made in a  previous chapter, and Adie asked Leslie, how it hap- i pened that he engaged 4n business with one so oppo-  site to himself, in all respects, both public and pri- I vate.                         *oI   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       43 "In selecting a partner in business, Miss Adie, we have regard to other qualities than those which go to make an agreeable companion, or a devoted husband. Mr. Carter is a man of sterling integrity, believes in conducting his business upon the strictest principles of fairness and honesty; and as he happened to want a partner about the time I wanted to go into business, it came to pass that we associated ourselves together." "But I don't see how you ever manage with your clerks: lihe is stern even to his own shrinking wife, he must be a perfect ogre to them." "Not stern to his wife, Adie, but simply not sympa- thetic. He belongs to that class of men, which I do not think very large, however, who regard women and women's pursuits as, something on a decidedly lower plane of existence than themselves or their own, and consequently as beings and pursuits with which they cannot be expected to sympathize, but which they are rather to tolerate and patronize." "I wish," said Adie, with some warmth, "he had married a woman's-rights advocate; she might have given him some wholesome lessons." "Which 1he would never have listened to; and as the consequence would have been strife where now is peace, perhaps it is as well that Mr. Carter chose his own wife." "But," asked Delia, 'a how does Mr. Carter regard his clerks?" "With some interest, as being of his own superior sex, but with little consideration fpr their faults or the indiscretions, not, to use a harsher word,' natural to youth." "Now, Mr. Norton, do you mean to say it is natural for young men to go astray," broke in Adie. "I meant to say, Adie, that it was the most natural -.   ; 44      HERE AND HEREAFTER: thing in the world, considering to what influences they are, for the most part, exposed. That is the extent of my treason. Under other circumstances and influences, I should say t llat it was natural for them to do right. But to conclude what I was saying about Mr. Carter: he lacks sympathy for his clerks too; and never having known, in his own youth, the temptations incident to ardent natures and fiery tempers, he neither under- stands nor sees the least necessity for any deviation whatever from such rules of conduct as he has laid down for himself, founded for the most part on the most rigid rectitude. Consequently the clerks fear and respect him, but do not love him." "How do you manage them, Leslie, with your phil- anthropic and Utopian notions?" contilned Adie. "I don't manage them at all, Adie. I remember that they are young men with feelings as sensitive as my own,--more so perhaps,-some of them proud and re- sentful of enforced authority; so I treat them like gen- tlemen, as I wish them  to treat me,-no better, no worse, - and I trust them until I have cause not to do so any longer; then I reason with them, as I would wish  to be reasoned with myself. We are all such egotists, Adie, that, if we consider how we ourselves would like to be treated, and treat -others accordingly, we shall l have more influence with them than in any other way., ; But I was not aware that there was anythng Utopian in this; I thought it was only Christian." "Well, Leslie, I must confess you are a novel ex- pounder of the golden rule."             "A pretty safe one, at least," said Madam Norton,  "since he is not disposed to glorify himself or his motives."            '      ' "But I'm to have an answer, Leslie. Is it egotism !   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        4 that induces you to take the golden rule for your rule of life?" "Perhaps not, only a refined species of selfishness," he answered, laughing. "It makes me happy to see others so. I can't -help it any more than Mark Tapley could help being jolly, so I take no credit for it. Consequent- ly, it 's my will to do what is best calculated to secure that result." "But many people don't care a straw whether others- are happy or not." "But as I am so constituted that' I do, don't you see that the surest way to insure my own happiness is to do something to promote that of others?" "Yes, I see," replied Adie, with some emotion in her voice; ",and I see also that there is something more than constitution or egotism or refined selfishness as springs of action with you."   "      - HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER V. i' We luigh heartily to see a whole flock of sheep jump, because one did so: might not one imagine that superior beings do the same by us, and for exactly the same reasonl."- GREVILLE. "WHAT a love of a place you have here, Delia! Was it your taste, or Mr. Norton's?  How you, witlh your fondness for the country, must elnjoy it! Now I like tlhe relief of living a few months out of town, because, everybody else does; but I should think it the greatest bore in the world to live here the year thlrough.  No opera, no theatre, concert, lectures, or chance for shop- ping, and, by the way, there's little enough of that in Boston." Pausing to take breath, the speaker, Mrs. Fitzroy, ar- ranged the folds of her real lace mantilla, and looked complacently down upon her rich flounced dress. Before Delia had time to reply, Miss Delavan said, sen- timentally: "Such sweet, picturesque views as you have here, Mrs. Norton! such drives and walks! and then it is so charming to be able to adopt a more rural costume, to wear lawns, organdies, and flats, in place of silks, jewels, and French hlats!" "Charming," replied Clara, sarcastically, " especially if the muslin and organdie cost nearly as much as the silk, and the flat is said to be very becoming to the style of one's features. Miss Lawton, how do you do? It is a long time since I have had the pleasure of seeing you," addressing the latter, who at that moment entered the room.    OR, THE TWO ALTARKS i  .     ' "Not so very long since I saw youg, Mrs. Fitzroy," replied Adie. "I was at St.    Churcll not long Since.' "Ah! indeed H did n't know it, as how should I? Where one knows one's to be a spectacle, it 's best to brave it out and not appear to know or see anybody." Adie thought what she did not say, that perlhaps there had been a little too much braving it out. In answer to Delia's inquiries about her mother and Maria and Herbert, Clara said: " O, mother has let her house this year, and is boarding at West Chester with some friends. Herbert is at school now, and will be with mother in his vacation. He 's such a queer chap, I should n't wonder, after all, if we have a clergyman in our family. I do all I can to put the matter out of his head, but he always says, 'I mean to be a minister when I'm a man.' As for Maria, poor thing, she's to stay all summer in that hot, close street. Mother wanted her to come with her, but Maria would n't.  It 's pride that keeps her away, I suppose; for you know, if she can't dress as others do, she won't go anywhere. To be sure, she is wretchedly out of health and has a shocking cough. She stays at home most of the time, and lies upon her couch reading novels. You know she always read them so much. And then her little Felice is such an odd thing! The last time I saw her I tried to coax her to me with sugar-plums, and she opened her great 'black eyes, and said, 'Non, non, je vous n'aime pas, Aunt Clarie.' She talks half French and half English, which Maria does n't like, as she says it 's too much trouble to nmake her out, she speaks so fast; but her father wishes it, and in all this world there's but one person for Felice, and that is ' mon cher pdre.' But re- ally, Julia, we must go, after," turning to Delia, " one look at your house."   48       HERE AND HEREAFTER: Delia led the way to the library and dining-room. The former, which was of dark wood, with rich carpet and paper and curtains, in which crimson was the pre- dominant color, pleased Clara, who always had an eye for the gorgeous. "This," said Delia, "is Leslie's taste. I tell him his wanderings in tropical regions have given him a partial- ity for bright colors; but he says in winter such a room is so cheerful, and in summer it is cool here, it is kept so dark and shaded. Now for the upper regions." While Miss Delavan was in ecstasies at the simple yet tasteful arrangements of the sleeping apartments, Clara said, in a careless tone: "O0 yes, very pretty, just like Delia. I must see every nook. Here is your bou- doir, I suppose," opening, as she spoke, the door leading into the little room previously described. One glance was sufficient for her to see it was not such a boudoir as she expected, and with a "Very pretty," but in a tone graver than her previous one, she hastily closed the door and descended  the stairs withl atlhoughtful expression upon her face. She urged Delia and Adie to come and see her, and with evident sincerity; for if she could not sylmpathize with them in their taste, she at least could, and did, respect them both. A  few minutes later Mrs. Fitzroy was in her own house,--having engaged to meet her husband there,-- and deep in contemplated changes and improvements. She spoke of Mr. Norton's library, and said she should like to have theirs in dark wood, and to have it fir'- nished in something the same manner. To this proposal Mr. Fitzroy replied, that he preferred S something. different and ligliter, and for colors, either green or blue. .                       RS t .        OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       49 "But I want blue for my dininig-room and green for half the upper rooms, Mr. Fitzroy. Do let 's have crim- sonl for the library." "Furnish your drawing-rooms to your own taste, Mrs. Fitzroy, but allow me the privilege of mine for the library. I believe you spoke of it as my room, a short time since."  Clara bit her lip with vexation, but made no reply. Turnlig to Julia, who was gazing out of the window upon the river, which gleamed at a distance, she said somewhat sharply: "Let us go up stairs, Julia." Here, Miss Delavan, who was not always an unobserv- ant spectator of whlat was passing in her presence, said: "How can you, Clara, oppose Mr. Fitzroy so much. I always thought it was the bliss of wedded life to vie with each other in yielding tastes and preferences." "Perhaps to vie with each other," retorted Clara with marked emphasis; " but where the yielding is all on one side, what then?" "O, then, of-course, we should yield to the sterner sex. It is delightful to feel a sweet dependence upon stronger natures, so like the vine and the oak, you know. The vine is never self-asserting." "To the yielding part, judging from my experience," answered Clara bitterly, " few men object; but to the clinging dependence you speak of, most men, I fancy, prefer that their wives shall be able to stand upon their own feet,--take a little care of themselves, and not- a little of their lords. More especially, I fancy this to be the case with poor men; their own weight is about as much as they are able to drag through the world, with- out the additional one of even a  weaker and lighter vessel." The meaning of this last innuendo was not lost upon :... 5   50       HERE AND HEREAFTER: Julia, who, however, was constitutionally too good- natured to resent it, and accordingly made no reply. But she was getting tired of playing third in this mat- rimonial game, since the tender scenes she had pictured to herself were seldom realized in actual life before her. Indeed, preoccupied althougll she was with her own affairs, she could not but observe that Mr. Fitzroy never yielded a hairbreadth to Clara, and, on the con- trary, she -never yielded gracefully or .kindly to him, and that consequently there was not infrequent jarring between them.                In a surprisingly short space of time Mr. Fitzroy's house was finished, and furnished, the library after his taste, the drawing and upper rooms after hers. Every- thing was very handsome and rich, and, if less appro- priate to the country than Mr. Norton's, it was no more gorgeous than was to be found in many of the neighbor- ing residences, and Clara was sufficiently weary of hotel life and its restraints to be glad to be settled in her own home. But it was no part of Mr. Fitzroy's plan to live quietly and retired. For what purpose had he spent sa much money upon a country residence? Why had he such elegant plate and costly china? Why had he such a good cellar and such fine stables? and, as the crowning adjunct of himself, such a handsome, fashionable wife? To live in the practice of the homely domestic, or the unfashionable Christian virtues? No, surely;, no such purpose had he formed or idea had he entertained. Tile world was the god whom he served, and the chief object of all his accessories and surroundings was to make his worship such as would confer distinction on himself. Mr. Fitzroy was no lukewarm devotee; for his time, his talents, his money, and his personal ease were all freely   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.    a   51 and disinterestedly offered before the shrine at which he bowed down;-- yes, disinterestedly; for had he not -long since learned, that the world gives no return for hle services rendered at its altar, and that its apples of pleasure are but dust and ashes to the taste, however fair they may be to the eye? So he kept open house, whither guests of fashion and distinction constantly re- sorted, who ate his dinners, drank his wine, smoked his cigars, rode or drove his horses, admired his wife, and criticised all by turns. True, sometimes he returned from his business with an aching head and an anxious heart, perplexed with some mercantile problem or dis- turbed by some heavy loss. But the sincere worshipper, at whatever altar he hows, heeds not personal annoyance or self-sacrifice. If the inference has been drawn from the foregoing pages, that Mr. Fitzroy was selfish and exacting towards his wife, this great devotion to the object of his idolatry amust be his atoning excuse. As for Clara, education and certain qualities of char- acter fitted her eminently for the position she occupied. But other qualities she had, which, developed and exer- cised by a master hand, would have chalnged her whole course of life. As it was, her love of display and activity, her want of intellectual resources, and, above-.... all, the woman's heart, which early taWight her that the only way to preserve even a semblance of her husband's affection was to consult his tastes and pursuits, made the life she led the most natural and easy for her. If to her came hours of weariness and depression, when none would have recognized in the pale, inanimate figure upon a loWige, the admired Mrs. Fitzroy of the preceding evening, what did it matter? since another hour would find her, perhaps, again transformed into the gayest of the gay.   52       HERE AND HEREAFTER: After her settlement in N--, she saw little of her coltsin, their paths of life diverging so rapidly, that noth- ing but the tie of relationship, good wishes, and interest on one side, some gratitude, and a good deal of genuine respect on the other, ever broughllt them together. 'Mrs. Fitzroy made herself quite popular in the neighborhood, i however, by her lavish hospitality and generally urbane manners; and Mrs. Musgrave early expressed the opin- ion, which nobody was bold enlough to gainsay, that the young bride from New York was really an acquisition to the society of N--; that she had superiorwowers of mind, and was every way calculated to be a leader in fashion, wherever she went. Some ill-natured pe son, however, 1had the hardihood to say, that' Mrs. Fitzroy's powers of mind were shown in lher deference to Mrs. Musgrave, and willingness to acknowledge her authority. Be that as it may, Mr. Fitzroy was gratified to see that his handsome young wife was as much admired and as popular as lie wished his wife to be. So those butter- flies of fashion spread their gay wings an floated care- lessly on the summer breeze, intent only on present enjoyment. But where was Miss Delavan all this time?   The friends became mutually tired of each other's society after a while; and Julia, although her original inten- tion had been to pass the summer with Mrs. Fitzroy, availed herself of the intelligence of her mother's de- clining health as a pretext for returning home. A few weeks later, as Clara, in one of her depressed moods, aggravated by some slight matrimonial differ- ence, was reclining listlessly il; a luxurious chair in her  morning room, a letter was brought to her from her late companion. Perusing it with an expression of astonish- ment on her face, which gradually gave place to one- of   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        53 supreme contempt, when she tossed it on the carpet, and exclaimed: "What a simpleton! I find it hard enough to drag through life with all the appliances of wealth; whlat will lie do without it, or with so little?" At thllis moment the servant announced Mrs. Norton waiting below. "Show her up stairs; I am so glad she has come!" Presently Delia entered, looking bright alnd animated, and having a deeper tinge of'color in her face than usual. As she saw her cousin looking so pale and weary, she exclaimed: ' Are you sick, Clara?" "Sick? O no, only tired; and vexed at this foolish letter. What do you think Julia has done?" "I don't know; not eloped, I hope." "Slhe was ready for that long ago; but fortunately Mr. Manning, despite his singular infatuation for her, has real prinlciple, and lie never hinted or thought of such a thing.  No, on the contrary, he went to Julia's uncle, from whom the family receive most of their sup- port, and stated the fact of their mutual attachment, and requested permission to pay his addresses to his niece. Mr. Delavan was favorably impressed, as far as I cali gather from Julia's rhapsody, with his manly straightforwardness, and, after putting the case to him in all its bearings, and representing that beyond her outfit Julia could expect nothing from him, and the good man still remaining firm, he gave his consent to their marriage, which, it seems, is to take pllace early in the autumnn, Mr. Mainning having become rector of one of the cthurces in C---, on the North River. I'm so vexed at it all, Delia, alfd so worn out with those tire- some Miss C----s, who have been here a week, and who are tfle greatest blue-stockings alive, that nlo wonder I look faded and weary." 5*  !   54      .HERE AND HEREAPTER: Delia smiled, and said she thllought the Miss C  ,A visit must have been a little trying, from one evening's experience of their society at Mrs. M-usgrave's. "But, she added, " why do you invite people to visit you whom you don't like?" "Ask Mr. Fitzroy that question, my charming cou- sin," answered Clara, shrugging her shoulders as she spoke. "How do you like my morning room? I won't have it called a boudoir.  I never could abide that word after hearing Mrs. Marston, one of onr niew-spruing Fifth Avenue gentry, say that Mary Loize had such a buchiful boodoie." "It is very glowing and splendid, Clara, fit for an Eastern princess; but I don't know  as I could think here." "That's why it suits my- purpose exactly, child. I  don't want to think; it does very well for good people like you  and Leslie to do tiat, but not for me.   I can sit or recline here and pass away my idle lloulrs." "But you cannot always drive away thought, Clara," said Delia, gently. "And if we live here to prepare for hereafter, how can we help thinking?" "f live for the present, Delia, as you know, and con- cern myself but little about that future wlich I, at least, am sure of sharing with two thirds of my acquaintances, wwhatever it be. Sometimes I  think I should like to have such hopes and feelings as you have; I thought so the morning I   looked into your oratory; for such it seemed to me; and since, I  have thought'once or twice how our respective tastes and characters were portrayed in these rooms. Here, all is glitter, luxury, and splen- dor,- an altar to fashion; there, purity, simplicity, and holiness seemed to shine out from every article of fur-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        55 niture even,-an altar to truth and virtue.   There, now I have confessed to you, Delia, and you see I'm not always thoughtless. The conclusion of the whole matter is, our lives and destinies are suited to our- selves, - yours to you, mine to me." "But we make our lives and destinies in a great measure; and you, Clara, I am quite sure, might make yours whatever you please." "Perhaps so; but then I don't please, I suppose; and if the time should ever come whena I shall, why then we'll talk about it. But you haven't told me what you think of Julia's match." "I don't know enough of either party, Clara, to judge. If sentiment is Juia's greatest weakness, and she has at the foundation a really good heart, a few years of life will change thlat; and after all she may make an excellent wife." "Shle's good-hearted enough, I believe; and I think is really in love with Mr. Manning, preposterous as it appears to me." "But why preposterous?" asked Delia, smiling. ; "'Why did she love him? Curiouis fool,.be still. Is human love the growth of human will?" O, because, Byron to the contrary notwithstanding, witlh girls in our station of life, human will has some- tling to do with the tender passion. Mrs. Delavan has always been one of those lucky persons, who, having nothing themselves, continue to dress and live in style, and so Julia has been brought up. Now, to think of those white hands of liers washing dishes, and wlmat not; for I 'm sure, minister's wives- do sometimes lhavc such drudgery to perform. Witness our Mrs. Howe, whose hands look as -"   56       HERE AND HEREAFTER: '-If they were made to use," interposed Delia. "'Yes, I heard her say once that she did not, as a matter of taste, like liard work; but there was nothing to which she could not put her hands if necessary. Is Julia fond of dress and living in style? is the chief question, not what she has been accustomed to." " O, as to that, I don't think she cares for much of anything but love and moonlight, and gliding rivers, and picturesque scenery."- "Well, I would n't imagine evils for her or Mr. Man- ning, if I were you, Clara. I don't think it is always possible to judge who are or who are not suited to each other; and for your encouragement I remember once to have heard Aunt Leslie say, that matclhes seem- ingly the most incongruous often turned out the most happily." A "After all," said Clara, "I don't know why I should care if they do marry to suit themselves. This slavery to the world is terribly irksome sometimes. It was good for you to come and see me in this way, Delia; but I'm glad Adie did n't tome with you." "' She 's in town to-day. But why are you glad?" "Because I'm a little afraid of her, though I have always liked her since she was so attentive to my father in his last sickness; and he seemed to be so grateful to her and fond of her. I think it was partly because she was your friend, that lie liked her. But then I think she is one of the clearest-sighllted persons in the world; she sees thhrough you at once, and if there are any shams, she very soon finds it out, and somehow you feel that she knows all about you. Now she always makes me think, - and, as I told you, I don't like to think, - espe- cially when I feel as I do this morning, as if I was a very insignificant alld useless creature after all, despite   OO1 THE TWO ALTARS.        57 all the nonsense I hear about Mrs. Fitzroy. Must you go? Well, Delia, if the time ever comes to me when I want to think seriously, I 'll tell you, but I don't think it ever will. Stop a minute and see my new berege ; it came this morning from New York. Is n't it lovely? And, O Delia, your taste in certain things is perfect, I want an evening head-dress to wear with my blue tis- sue; shall it be silver leaves and drops, or some soft, floating material?" This important matter having been satisfactorily set- tled, Delia wds allowed to take leave, wlhicll she did with very sad thoughts, induced by what she had seen and leard. Remembering, as she did, her cousin Fred's sufferings of mind when he at last awoke to a true sense of his soul's condition, she feared how it would be with Clara, when at last she should find herself forced to do what she now so carefully tried to avoid, that is, to think. The never-to-be silenced monitor, whcll God has given to all his creatures, will be heard sooner or later, seek as we may to stifle its warning voice, or turn a deaf ear as we may to it. Its hlour will come, and its record, faithful and true, will be laid open. A,    58 '     HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER VI. "A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded, A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded." -BYRno. "I HAVE sent for you," said Mrs. Norton kindly to Annie Clarke, as they sat together in the former's pleas- ant bedroom, "from the interest I feel in you. I think you must be very lonely at home, and I wished to -pro- pose to you to come and pass a part of each day with me. We can read and study together, or I will give you any assistance you may need in your lessons. .Have you the leisure, and can you be spared from home?" "O, yes indeed, ma'am, as well as not; but I know so little,--not much beside reading, writing, some geography, grammar, and arithmetic, -- I am afraid you would not like to teach me." "I should like to very much. You know you can learn your lessons at home, and come and recite them to me as I sit and sew.  When shall we commence? You are sure your father will not object?" "O, no indeed, he won't care, if I 'm particular in returning home in season to attend to things about the house.  I was thinking this morning I wished I knew more, but though I love study, it is not so pleasant to go on alone with no one to advise me. If I may come here, I will try to be as little trouble as possible." "The walk will do you good. I can usually give you some attention between nine and eleven, and when I am prevented, you can go on with your lessons until another day."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       59 "You are very good, Mrs. Norton, but what can I do for you in return?" asked the young girl, earnestly. "Something, I dare say, some time or other. There are services money cannot buy; perhaps you can render some such to me at some future time; or, if not to me, to somebody else, and that will do as well." Having settled the plan of study, Delia gradually drew from her young pupil some account of her life at home, and found that most of it, after her daily duties were performed, was spent in those vague dreams of tie future, which ardent imaginative young persons are so prone to indulge in. "I am so happy, Mrs. Norton, when I sit at my little window, and look out upon the beautiful fields and meadows, and think how it will be when James and I live together. I don't think much about James getting rich, for I'm afraid if he did, we should n't be happy; yet if he does n't, I don't know how we sliall get along very well. I believe in all my castles I seem to think we have everything as beautiful as the prince and prin- cess in fairy tales, but I don't know where the money comes from; I don't like to think about that." ' I would n't think about it, Annie, nor spend much time in your fairy palaces, which perhaps you will never possess. If you study, you will have more whole- some food for your mind." "But then I'm so happy, when I have these visions; it does not seem the- least like this world." "But when your grand visions are over, and you are busy at your work, do you not sometimes feel more un- happy from the contrast between your fancy and the reality?" "Sometimes I do, to be sure. I remember, onlt two or three days ago, I was sitting at my window, and I   60       HERE AND HEREAFTER: thought James had a beautiful house, and I was his sister; but it was my duty and great delight to wait lupon him; and we were sitting together by a beautiful little silver lake, where the trees bent over so gracefully that their long branches touched the water; and be- side us was a little table spread with delicious firuits, which I was giving to James. Then there was far off in the grounds sweet music, -which made me feel almost as if I had wings. After James had eaten I thought I ran to the place where a little boat, which looked like a large beautiful shell, was fastened, and I brought it to James, and we got into it and rowed about on the lake and listened to the music." "Did you eat any of the fruit?"    asked Delia, smiling. "O no! I never do in these visions. I only sit and look at James.  But what I wanted to tell you was, that, just as we were passing under one of those trees which drooped so sweetly, I heard father call me; and when I went down into our little, poor kitchen, and set the pork and beans over the fire to warm, I could not hlelp thinking of the difference, and I believe I shched a few tears.  You will tlink me so foolish, Mrs. Norton, to have such feelings; but I do so love everything that is beautiful. I don't care about nice things to cat lalf so much as to see what is beautiful. O, our brown dishes  and plain fare looked so homely after my vision!" t "Well, my dear girl," said Delia, kindly, " will you promise me to give up your visions, as you call them, and  enjoy as much as you  can of the real about you?" "I will try; and I think I can, if I have anything to do."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       61 Mrs. Norton then made a few inquiries as to her at- tainments, gave her some easy task for the next day, and dismissed her to her home. When she gave her husband an account of the interview, he said:- "You have a serious work before you, Delia, to check and judiciously train that too active imagination, so as not to impair the child's keen perception of the beauti- ful, which may be made an important help in her moral culture."  "I know it will be a difficult task, but it will also be a pleasant one; she is so natural and frank, - so gentle and lady-like, and so pretty, too. I can't help thinking how delightful it will be to open before her the treas- ures of past wisdom, and witness- their effect upon her mind. She impresses me like a wild vine, which, un- trained and unpruned, has thrown out its tendrils in every direction with luxurious exuberance, and-without having a firm hold upon anything. Shall I not be the skilful gardener, who, pruning here and binding there, adding new supports and pulling out weeds, shall bring this goodly plant into that perfection to which it was designed- to be brought?" "I hope so," said Leslie, smiling; " but one restric- tion I must lay upon you, Delia, that you do not devote yourself so assiduously to training this wild vine of yours as to neglect your own health.  I have learned, that, although Annie has no near relatives on the moth- er's side, her mother's family was a very respectable one, and that she lost caste by marrying a man beneath her in station, as well as in character. To elevate others is always a worthy object, and we will do all we can for this brother-and sister; and if you find that Annie is promising and gifted, it will be the greatest kindness you can bestow upon her to give her every advantage of 6 t   62       HERE AND HEREAFTER: education. I approve of your making the commence- ment yourself, and thus ascertaining her capabilities; and then we will decide what further to do for her. Is not that the better course?" "Certainly, Leslie, and I am glad I have your ap- proval. You have proposed the very plan I was about to suggest. I confess I like to see results occasionally, and I should prefer spending a certain portion of our income yearly for such a purpose than for some others, where I, at least, could never be sure of having done any good." "Our!" said Leslie, laughing. "I thought you(were the rich partner in this firm.- You forget tliat) Mrs. Musgrave said Mr. Norton had married a great heiress." "I shall say our income, nevertheless. I approve of -the principle of women having their own property set- tled upon themselves, but I never wish to hear of yours or mine between husband and wife. No, I repeat our income, and I warn you, sir, in remembrance of old firmness, not to mention heiress again to me at your peril." "What will your valiant ladyship do, in case her com- mands are transgressed?T" '"You will see, sir,--you will see. I feel that I have a hitherto undeveloped find of shrewishness in my con- stitution; beware that yours be not the hand to bring it out." "' What then 2 Think you a little din can daunt mine ears? Have I not in my time heard lions roar? Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds, Rage like a hungry boar, chafed with sweat? And do you tell me of a wonman's tongue 2?'" replied Leslie, putting himself into a stage attitude as he sooke.   OB, THE TWO ALTARS.       63 "But, Leslie, to be serious now, and change the sub- ject, don't you think Uncle Howard is failing?" "I fear he is, my love; but it is a failure so gradual as to be scarcely perceptible to any save those who watch him closely. I think when the last link with him shall be severed, it will be very gently done. He is so happy in his faith in the world to come, that one should not wish to delay him longer on the road which he is so peacefully travelling." "I suppose one should not; but, O Leslie, you know, not what he has so long been to me. But why I speak of hm- now is to say how much he is interested for Annie; and he says we cannot do a better thing than give her a good education, and bring some light into that desolate home of hers." One evening after Delia's return from the Ladies' Sewing Society, to which she had been for the first time in compliance with Mrs. Musgrave's invitation, Adie said to her: "Gossip is forbidden in this house, I know, Mrs. Norton, and also all evil-speaking against our neighbors; but I must have a little. sketch, which will be neither, of the principal dramatis persones of your sewing-circle. Mrs. Musgrave I know, and I can now see her in her capacity of first directress, giving orders, and dispensing work as only superior women can do such things. 'Our' minister's wife I know, too, as one of those rarce aves, a person just suited to her posi- tion, - that is-to say, always equally agreeable to every one; smiles and weeps just at the right moment; is always at leisure, and always busy; does all her own sewing, and half her housework; tends her babies, in- structs her elder children, visits the parish and stays at home; improves her mind, criticises her husband's ser- mons, and - is president of the sewing society,".   "      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "Poor Mrs. Howe!" said Delia, laughing; " she must be a rara avis indeed, to do all that; but she is a very lovely, interesting, and capable woman, I am told, and I can see." "Yes, I know she is. Then I know poor Mrs. Carter, whose fine gifts and powers of mind shine out only through those wonderful dark eyes of hers, and the few, very few remarks she makes. She is a busy worker I know, and while her fingers fly, her thoughts keep pace. Those are- about the only ladies that I have the honor to be much acquainted with. Now as every place is bound to have its character, who is the character par eminence of this village? or perhaps I should say char- acters, for I am mistaken if there is not a pair of them, at least, in that old brown house on the hill." "Yes," answered Delia, " and so you see what you lost by perversely staying at home. Miss Ellis was there all the afternoon; and her brother came for her after. tea." "O, that is delightful. Is he cross, and she sarcastic? Such I fancied them to be from the glimpse I had of them one Sunday. By the way, why does n't she visit the lady of Rosedale?" "She intends so to do very soon; then you will have an opportunity to judge for yourself with regard to the peculiarities of her character." "But your impressions are what I want now." "Precisely what I don't mean to give you; neither do I intend to favor you with ally general description of the ladies. I suppose they all possess the average amount of human nature and human feelings. They certainly are S jindustrious, and much engaged in their work. I heard scarcely any gossip, and a good deal of very agree- able and sensible conversation. The ladies are also very   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        65 social together, and appear as if they were really in- terested in each other  The object of the society is twofold: first, benevolence, which looks after the needy in this neighborhood, and makes contribution to certain religious and philanthropic objects in the city, and to some missionary enterprises elsewhere; and, second, so- ciality, which of course the meetings promote. The so- ciety is large, and, I should judge, embraces some diver- sity of opinion as to the best disposition to be made of its yearly avails; but its objects are so comprehensive, that the interest of each one is attended to, - and the mem- bers seem to be very much united. Mrs. Musgrave, su- perior woman as you call her, displays uncommon ability in discharging -the duties of her office. I really like Mrs. Musgrave, and though perhaps I should not choose her for a friend, I think she is a sincere and reliable woman. Some persons have the, organ of self-esteem more fully developed than others,-and, after all, there are worse faults." "Do tell me about Mr. Ellis; he won't call with his sister?" "I think he will; at least, wait and see." Delia was right; in fact, Miss Ellis had told her that she had only been waiting for her brother to accompany her to visit them. Accordingly, she was not surprised when they presented themselves the next evening. One look at Miss Ellis, whol marched rather than walked into the room, and, taking off her cape bonnet, seated herself at an open window, told Adie that in her she would find a match; for there was a shrewd ex- pression in her face, and a gleam of humor in her clear blue eyes, which indicated great quickness of perception and some mirthfulness. The brother followed his sister into the room, a perfect contrast to herself; for while 6*   "      HERE AND HEREAFTER: she was erect and firm as a soldier in her bearing, he stooped slightly, and almost shuffled along; while she was of a light complexion 'and cheerful aspect, he was very dark and gloomy, thick brown hair almost covering lis forehead, having heavy dark brows of, however, a perfect arch, and a stern or compressed mouth. Miss Ellis commenced conversation directly, as if accustomed to it; and it was quite evident that her brother was will- ing she should sustain it, for he seldom spoke, althoughl his keen dark eyes glanced from one to another, ob- servant of all that was said. Miss Ellis was quick and abrupt in her manner of speaking. "I did n't see you at the ladies' society with your friend yesterday, Miss Lawton," she said, address- ing Adic, immediately upon being introduced to her. "No ma'am," was the reply, ;; I never belonged to one and  " "Never wanted to, I suppose; don't know anything about them, I dare say; - take it for granted they are schools of scandal, &c.,-have heard gentlemen say so very likely. Edwin," turning to her brother, " do you ever happen to catch any words of gossip or slander among your superior sex in Mr. Reed's store, as you sit quietly over your newspaper in the reading-room?" "Why do you ask that, Anstrice?  Gossip, scandal, profanity, and what not; but I never told you." "Some one else did, who is less saving of liis words, good brother, in illustration of a point spoken of. Miss Lawton, we nmnber in our society several intelligent, cultivated, Christian" - with a marked emphasis on the word  "women.   Don't you think, with this ad- vantage, we are able to give a tone to conversation? Come to my house at the next meeting, and see how it is."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       67' "I thank you, Miss Ellis, I will, certainly. But it seems to me you lhave been prejudging me. I gave no such reasons for not going with Mrs. Norton to the so- ciety as you ascribe to me."' "No need of it. I have n't lived twoscore years in the world without having learned how to read a young lady's face." "I shall not be obliged then to make use of language in conversing with you, Miss Ellis," answered Adie laugh- ing; " it is quite a superfluity." The visitor nodded, and laughed, and, turning to De- lia, said, "I've forgiven you, Mrs. Norton." Delia looked puzzled, and said, "I am glad, Miss Ellis, to have regained your favor; but, pardon me, I was not aware before that I had incurred your displeas- ure. In what have I been so unfortunate?" "In what? Do you ask in what? Don't you know I like what's pretty and picturesque, or do you think I 'm too prim an old maid for that? Did n't you have the old house pulled down, and the old well-sweep taken away?  Was n't that an offence against me, taking from the sight of my eyes what they had looked upon all my days?" s A most unintentional one at least." "I dare say. Well, I 've forgiven you, for you have made about the prettiest picture of this spot anywhere about. Now I go in for improvements; I don't believe in always doing as our fathers did before us; and I'm glad to have -people come into town, who will make im- provements that are such; give us substantial good houses, and not gingerbread palaces; don't make toy- shops of their parlors, nor put their furniture into pina- fores; have some respect for old trees and old people. In short I like you, Mrs. Norton, and your husband too.   "      HERE AND HEREAFTER: I believe you are sensible young folks, who don't expect, because you have got money, that you are to have smooth sailing all your lives. No, no; prosperity is a trial, and no mistake; not such a trial as poverty, but a barder one to bear with Christian grace. I mean to be a good neighbor to you. Will you show me your garden? I have a passion for roses; and I have a word to say besides." Delia followed rather than led Miss Ellis, whose last words had been spoken with the greatest rapidity, and without allowing opportunity for a reply; and as-they walked along the paths, she said: "I am   very glad--" "Of my good opinion, you would say," interrupted Miss Ellis.!"I believe you; and you have it. You are not indifferent to the good-will even of an eccentric old maid. But I wanted to speak to you about Annie Clarke. You have a clew, which I never have been able to obtain, to her confidence. She is a beautiful young creature, not merely pretty; she will need watching she is so innocent. I wish to put you on your guard. You don't know about life in its darkest phases. I do, at least some of them, and some day I will tell you what has made a wreck of my once noble, handsome Edwin." Here she clasped her hands and looked so stern, that Delia involuntarily started. "Yes, I will tell you some time. But now about Annie; she is six- teen, as utterly ignorant of actual life as if she had lived in a wilderness all her days. Her beauty has been already noticed by one of those persons whom, if my religion was not one of peace and forgiveness, I could find in it my heart utterly to detest; - a cold, heartless sensualist,- a man almost beneath contempt, who has lived long enough not even to have the excuse of youth-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       69 fll passion for his vices; for I know he is vicious, tholroughly so, although he bears a fair character, is rich and fashionable, and O so respectable, and so courted! I can see through thicker masks than any worn by your lively friend within; and I know what that man's history has been since he left--since his early youth, just as if I saw it all now mapped out be- fore me." "Who is he?" "That you will discover soon enough. Teach Annie to confide in you, and she will be safe. I need not in- struct you what to do; you will know when there is occasion. Thank you for these roses. Now we will go in." And Delia followed her visitor again to the company left in the parlor.  Come, Edwin," said Miss Ellis, as soon as they entered the door, "it's time for us to go home- Come to-morrow," addressing Delia, " and take tea with us at the old brown house, - all of you, Madam Norton, your good husband, and Miss Adie ; won't you?" "Thank you, we shall be very happy to." "That's right. Tea at six. Good by." "Those good people will answer capitally for charac- ter," said Adie, after they had gone. c But I like Miss Ellis, brusque as she is. It seems to be my fate to like such people," she added, with a laugh; " but is she a witch or a fairy, or what, Leslie, that she read -all my thoughts so quickly?" "Neither, I fancy, but simply a shrewd, observant woman, who has known life, anid not always on its sunny side, although she is herself, as it is evident, a very cheerful person, and, I have been told, keeps her brother, who has an inherited predisposition to insanity   70       HERE AND HERIAP3PTER: or melancholy, from falling back into the condition in which for two years she faithfully nursed and tended him, and out of which she at last brought him. This a neighbor of theirs told me. His disease was occasioned by some unusually trying disappointment in love, and the sister has not come to her present mature age with- out having had some experience of the tender passion also; but that which almost foundered him sent her onward into life with new earnestness and activity." "Dear me," said Adie, dolefully, "I must resign all pretension to being a reader of character now. I should have said that Miss Ellis had never conjugated the verb anmo, in any of its moods or tenses, in her life. Why, she looks altogether too stately and sensible to have ever been wounded by the little god; and then her energy and cheerfulness forbid the idea, that she ever drooped or paled under the influence of that 'Grief beyond all other griefs, whose fate First leaves the young heart lone and desolate In the wide world, without that only tie For which it loved to live, or feared to die.' I suppose if she ever did love, however, it must have been some grand, heroic person, worthy of such a strong nature as hers." "I think not," replied Leslie, " although I know nothing with respect to her particular case. It is prob- able, rather, that her lover was some man decidedly inferior to herself, and that she disdained the thought of spending her whole life in fruitless regret for one never deserving of any consideration from her. But this is all fancy and speculation, and is sufficiently amusing to say the least; so now for a duet, Delia and Adie."   ORB THE TWO ALTARS.        71 "HAPTER     VII. "There are who in the path of social life Do bask their spotted skins in Fortune's sun, And sting the soul." - JOANNA BAILLIE. IF Adie Lawton had been prepossessed in favor of Miss Ellis at their first interview, she was much more so upon visiting her in her own home,--the before-mentioned old brown house on the hill. This same old brown house, and the farm attached, had been for several generations in the Ellis family, and its present dilapidated condition was owing to em- barrassments under which the estate was left by the father of the present owners. Some years since, the services of a worthy, practical man were secured to manage the farm,--one who was not too wise in his own conceit to receive suggestions from a woman as shrewd and far-seeing as Miss Ellis, for all the prudential ahnd executive talent of the family appeared to be centred in her; and now there was a fair prospect that Elm Hill, as the property was called from an avenue of old elms leading from the public road to the house, would soon be free from all encumbrances, and become the sole possession of the Lrother and sister. They had no near relatives, and people had often remonstrated with Miss Ellis against her denying herself luxuries and en- joyments for which she had a taste, and comforts even, for the sake of holding the old homestead, and in- dulged in all sorts of speculations with regard to it. But their remonstrances and speculations did not dis-   72       HERE AND HEREAFTER: turb the independent mistress of Elm Hill, nor cause her to alter her course. For all that any one might say, she went on her own way with the energy and determination of a: person who at least knew what she was about. At home Miss Ellis, although always quick and some- times, abrupt in her speech, had that genuine cordiality and hospitality which at once put visitors at their ease, and assured them   that her feelings corresponded to her manners. The furniture and arrangements of the house and table were mostly those of a former genera- tion. But a well-stuffed arm-chair of modern pattern, some beautiful engravings, a few choice books of the most cherished among our own and English writers of the day, showed that, while the past was not outgrown nor discarded, there was an interest in the present. Miss Ellis too could not only talk, which most per- sons can do, but she could also converse, and that with an earnestness and originality of expression very inter- esting to those weary of the commonplaces of society. She was very decided in her own opinions, and quite willing  that others should be equally so in theirs. Her brother also appeared to much greater advantage at home than elsewhere, and sustained his part as host with a politeness and ease scarcely to have been expect- ed in one of his usual appearance and habits. He was a great reader and a thinker also, and was able to con- verse on poetry, light literature, theology, philosophy, science, and politics with equal readiness and discrimi- nation. After the visitors had returned home, Adie Lawton exclaimed: ' There, that's a visit worth making. I like to go to such places, one feels so much more. com- fortable in being addressed like a sensible and thinking   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       73 creature, than in listening to such talk as constitutes the staple of conversation in many a fashionable circle: 'What sweet hats Madame Lapage had at her opening!' 'What a divine voice Mademoiselle Turbot has!' or, ' How lovely Mrs. Badger's organdie is!' or, 'How dread- fully hot!' or, ' How horridly cold! ' or, ' How shock- ingly ugly Mrs. Lancaster's new dress fits! who can her dressmaker be?' or, ' Have you read Mrs. Romaunt's new novel? is in't it charming? so thrilling, such a splendid creature as the hero, Claude Delancy, is! and that adorable Miss Eversham, who was dying so many years for love of him! and then such glowing, pictures of real life, such elegant furniture and splendid car- pets, such plate and china, such dresses and paintings as she describes! O dear, I could read such books for ever!" "Have mercy on our ears, do, Adie!" said Delia; "if not, have some on your own tongue! I don't believe you have ever made a visit here, where the staple of conversation was such as you have just described."' "Or anywhere else," said Leslie. "Come, Adie, don't make our poor human nature worse than it actu- ally is." 'a Nor will I, good friends both, but if I did n't pay a visit last week, when that style of conversation was in the ascendant, then I'll sit down with folded hands, and demure face, and listen to a lecture from you both." O0, you mean at Mrs. Harris's?" said Delia. "I suppose she had rather a fashionable company, who talked upon fashionable subjects." "Yes, and some of the ladies voted Miss Ellis, as I chanced to overhear, a coarse woman, alike wanting in refinement and polish, because forsooth she handles 7   74      HERE AND HEREAFTER: folly without gloves, and calls certain practices among ladies by their right names. Now I like Miss Ellis, and for this very reason among others, that she never flat- ters, and because also she has already told me some home truths. I hope to hear more; and by the way, Delia, were you not surprised to hear her say she was going to .Mrs. Musgrave's party next week, given in  honor of the two brides?" "Not at all, she enjoys society, and has the faculty, I  imagine, if there is anything substantial in aly one, of drawing it out. Her quick, original mode of expression attracts attention, and sets one to thinking. She says,  you know, that she is fond of studying her kind, and  thinks a party as good a school as a rail-car or a steam- boat." Well," answered Adie, " she may study the genus, and I will study the species, or at least one particular variety, herself. I am bound to discover the secret of her influence over most people, and the genuine respect  which is felt towards her."  "I," said Leslie, "know it already, but will leave  you to make the discovery for yourself." Miss Ellis was not only at the party, but she did not disdain to be dressed in a becoming and appropriate manner, and she looked exceedingly well. Unfortu- nately for Adie's studies that evening, Melville Temple was present, and somewhat disposed to monopolize any leisure she might have, and she had no opportunity to make much progress. She noticed, however, that, ex-  i cept by a few, weak, flippant persons, whose neglect of real merit showed their own individual insignificance, Miss Ellis was treated with marked consideration. Late in the evening, Mr. and Mrs. Fitzroy made their m   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       75 appearance. At the moment of their not very quiet entre, Delia happened to be standing by Miss Ellis, and, turning to her, she said: "Do you know my cousin, Mrs. Fitzroy, Miss Ellis?" She did not immediately reply, but her face became flushed, and wore an expression of mingled contempt and vexation. After apparently struggling with herself for a few seconds, she answered in a forced tone: "No, I do not, and probably never shall. There, child, take off those honest eyes, will you? I thought I was a better dissembler, but Anstrice Ellis is not much more clever in some matters than was Emily Ellis. Mrs. Norton, come to see me to-morrow at eleven o'clock. Can you? will you?" Delia, although surprised at Miss Ellis's peculiar manner, assented, and then, with the ready tact of a truly kind heart, turned the conversation to some indif- ferent subject. The next day Mrs. Norton was punctual at the ap- pointed hour, and found Miss Ellis ready to receive her and conduct her up stairs to her own room. "You witnessed my foolish emotions last night, Mrs. Norton, upon the entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Fitzroy," she commenced immediately. "It was well, perhaps; for it has furnished me with a reason for opening to you one chapter in my early experience; and also an occa- sion for redeeming my promise to tell you of my broth- er's early disappointment. "Twenty years ago, Edwin and Emily Ellis--the name by which I was then called- were on a visit to some friends in the town of M ,and there formed an acquaintance with a family by the name of Fitzroy, the younger members of which, like ourselves, were a son I   76      HERE AND HEREAFTB ER: and daughter,-the son about two years my senior, the daughter about my brother's age.  They were handsome, accomplished, and agreeable. Mr. Fitzroy was entirely unlike any gentleman I had ever met in  my native town. But I shall not enter into details; it I is not essential to the purpose of my narrative. It is sufficient to say that I learned to love, as only such strong natures as mine can love, Leonard Fitzroy; and my brother, with his deep, passionate, poetic nature, had already deified the slight, graceful Sophia Fitzroy into his idol of worship. We were betrothed before my brother and I returned home, only our engagement    I waited the approval of my father, of which I felt secure  and with reason, as the sequel proved. Mr. Fitzroy was  then in business in his native town, and his circum-  I stances were such as to warrant a speedy union, which  he urged, and I returned home with that expectation.  "' My brother's youth and situation - he was then a  student in college--forbade the idea of his marriage  for several years, but he was happy in his faith in the constancy of his betrothed.               "Leonard Fitzroy visited me several times, and the s season of our wedding was fixed. My dress was pur-  9I chased and about to be made, and other preparations  were ill a state of forwardness. So implicit was my  faith in him, that I had not noticed that his letters were i shorter and colder, as I discovered finally; but my eyes were to be opened. About three weeks previous to the day appointed for our marriage, I received a letter from him couched in the coldest and most insulting language  possible,-at least I thought so then. The substance    of it was, that he had discovered a certain incompatibil-  ity in our characters and dispositions, which precluded all hope of domestic happiness; that he should always     OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       " remember me with respect, and that he should'* be glad of a continuance of my friendship. "I tore the letter into shreds. No lhuman being shall ever see how I was insulted. I locked myself into my room, and paced the floor, with each footfall striving to crush down my misplaced and abused affection. And I succeeded, - scorn took the place of love; and when I was summoned to dinner I took my seat at tihe table with no other indication of the disturbed state of my feelings than a flushed face, -- for my father asked if I had the headache. I answered yes, and truly. "My brother was the first person whom I told, and hsi sympathy;for me was so deep and earnest, that I knew what his sufferings would be under similar cir- cumstances. Over him I had always watched with an elder sister's care and pride. He inherited my father's temperament, and in his family there was a predisposi- tion to insanity, or, worse still, melanchloly. A few months after, he was as carelessly and heartlessly dis- carded as I had been. The playthings of idle hours with this perfidious and fickle pair, we were cast aside when new toys were found. Edwin reeled and stag- gered under the blow; it brought out all the unfortu- nate tendencies of his nature. A slow fever was fol- lowed by melancholy, whichl, it seemed, nothing could mitigate. In the months in which I had fought withl myself, before his trial came, I had succeeded in sub- duing my feelings; and when he was reduced to such a pitiable state, I devoted myself wholly to him. Every energy of my active nature was put into requisition for his sake. Long and earnestly, and asjif in a desperate: struggle, did I battle with the demon which possessed him. I assumed cheerfulness, and by and by it came, a real guest. I read and walked with him, and used 7*s   78      HERE AND HEREAFTER: every effort of which I was capable to restore him to his former self. In vain; he is but a wreck now of that former self, but I had at last my reward in seeing him once more calm, rational, and in a sense happy, but indisposed to exertion of any kind, and solitary in his habits. "I should have said, that our mother died a few years before these unhappy events, and my father was one who could not afford me any aid. To whom then could I turn? I was young, strong of will and purpose, - not shattered, but rather my character consolidated by my trial. But despite this, there was something want- ing to give me peace. I found I was not sufficient unto myself. In my present state of feeling, I could not be permanently happy. I took my Bible and read it, not as in those early days when, in the exuberance of youth, strength, and enjoyment, I thought myself sufficient for myself. I cannot relate to you the process I went through, before I learned where rest was to be found. Religion has been my support since. It has enabled me to help my brother along in his sad pilgrimage. "I was christened Emily Anstrice, and by the first name had always been called. But when I gave up the imaginative part of my life, I gave that up, and have gone since by the plain, practical one, Anstrice, in unison with my new feelings; and that is now familiar to me as Emily was to my early, happy years. "I had never seen Leonard Fitzroy from the disso- lution of our engagement until last evening. I did not think the sight of him would so have disturbed me, for o I never loved him; only a being I thought he was, - a being of a  worthy and elevated character. Long ago, love, or the thought of love, had died out of my heart, or what was left of it. For one moment I remembered  ;   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        79 myself young, handsome; yes, Mrs. Norton, I was so; loved, and him as I once deemed him; then I thought of his young wife, whol worldly as she is, deserves a better fate. Then again I thought    Mrs. Norton, he is the man whose evil eye has been on innocent Annie Clarke. In all these years between our broken engagement and his marriage, how has he lived?" Here Miss Ellis paused; presently resuming, she said: "Soon after that event, Leonard Fitzroy went into busi- ness in the city of New York, where he continued to reside until his removal to Boston, a short time previous to his marriage. I have heard from time to time of his career; it has been that of an outwardly respectable man of the world. O whited sepulchres!" she went on with an energy of voice and bearing startling to wit- ness, pacing the chamber floor the while. "Ye who outwardly are fair and goodly to look upon, and who scrupulously observe the conventional forms of society, how are ye within full of all manner of evil and un- cleanness! It needed not, Mrs. Norton, that I had ever heard of Fitzroy's course of life; I could read it on his face. It has not been in vain that, for long years, I have diligently studied that expressive index of the soul. In most cases it is as legible to me as if it was written all over in characters of fire. On that man's face I saw respectable vice, that is, vice indulged in covertly, so as not to shock scheming mothers' sense of propriety, or the delicacy of languishing daughters. Respectable vice! that which betrays the innocent, and sinks deeper and deeper down into the gulf of black- ness those who have already made shipwreck of char- acter upon its relentless waters! Respectable vice! as much more to be dreaded and feared than unmasked sin, as the treacherous strategy of Indian warfare than the open attack of known foe!   80      HERE AND HEREAFTER: a Perhaps you may be anxious to know why I fal so " great interest in Annie Clarke. Mrs. Norton, I am a ! lonely woman in the world; reversing the natural order of things with my own sex, I am myself a stay where I should look for support. I have no near relations, but in the veins of James and Annie Clarke flows my blood on the mother's side. It is true they are only distantly ! related to me, and they do not themselves know that  i they are that. But I -know it, and it is for them that I have toiled and labored, - strange as it may seem that  I should; for their father's hoarded wealth will never benefit them, - of that I am convinced. I have never been able, as I said before, to win the girl's confidence. I am repellent to her; I, the practical, abrupt, manly woman, have nothing attractive to the young, imagina- tive, delicate creature. Yet I am not discouraged; she will live to love me yet, when she knows me; until then, I commit her to your care. Why have I left her so long alone? you wish to ask. She is a child yet, and until now there has been little opportunity to gain access to her. - I will not ask you to respect my con- fidence; I am sure you will."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        81 CHA PTElR     VIII. "Never did any soul do good, but it came readier to do the same again, with more enjoyment." - SHAFTESBURY. DELIA NORTON had never liked Mr. Fitzroy; in fact, her first feeling towards him had been one of her former strong antipathies, for which she could scarcely account reasonably, but which still would have an influence over her; and to repress it she was obliged to resort to the old warfare with herself. Instinctively she had recog- nized the antagonism which. there always must be be- tween two persons, one so innocent in heart and pure in word and deed, the other so unholy in thought and mo- tive, so impure in life and practice. Probably for the same reasons he had disliked her. In her society he was always uneasy; it may have been because he felt in her presence a constant rebuke for his sins against her sex. With her he saw at once insidious flattery or obsequious admiration would be of no avail. The gulf between them was impassable. With his wife, the case was widely different, she belonging to that large class of women who have been taught by precept and example not to inquire too closely into the antecedents of those gentlemen considered good matches.   Moreover, the whole tone and manner of social life between the sexes at the present day in gay society being unfavorable to a very nice discrimination in morals, it is not surprising that Clara Grafton reasoned with regard to her intended husband's character, 1"Where ignorance is bliss, 't is   82       HTETRRE AND HEREAFTER: folly to be wise," - and gave herself very little concern about the matter, so long as it was not forced upon her observation. In the intimate relation subsisting between Mrs. Nor- ton and Annie Clarke, the former found it an easy matter to win the latter's confidence; and at last it be- came an event of daily occurrence for Annie to give to her an account of her employments and -recreations when absent from her, and she improved the opportuni- ties thus offered to give her interesting pupil such need- ful cautions as her condition and circumstances seemed to require. One day some allusion was made to even- ing walks, and Mrs. Norton advised her never to go unattended by her brother. "I never do now, Mrs. Norton; for I don't like to meet, as I sometimes do, the gentlemen who come out in the cars and stare so rudely at me. One day, one of them, too old to mean to be rude, I should think, said something about my being too pretty for such a hard life as I lived. If I am pretty, he had no right to say so, and I don't live a hard life now, Mrs. Norton. Now all the -time seems just as it does when I am with you; for when I am busy at my housework, I take pleasure in doing it neatly and well, and I strive, as far as I can, to make our poor place like Rosedale. You understand me, Mrs. Norton, don't you? I mean to have the same spirit there, and the same neatness and refinement." "Yes, I understand you," said Delia encouragingly. "And my father, seeing how careful I am, is pleas- anter than lie used to be; and James- -O, the best of all is, James is happy and pleased, that I am studying and improving. He reads to me evenings, sometimes; even poetry which he does n't like, just to please me.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        83 Somehow it always seems to me, when one does such things, they are improving themselves." "4 What things, - read poetry?" said Delia, smiling. '"Things one does n't like to do, for another's sake. I know it does me good." "Very true, Annie, and not you alone. You are quite right in thinking that, when one is self-denying and disinterested, he has taken a long step forward." "I am glad you say so, Mrs. Norton. I had to be a good deal self-denying, when I gave up building those castles in the air as you advised; but now I am really happier for it. Now I think of my studies, and how I shall profit by them, and how useful I will try to be, when I am older. I do hope I shall be able to do some- thing for you,-it is n't wrong to hope for something better in the future? for I think I must do that." "No, surely, if we don't look forward so eagerly as to lose the enjoyment of the present. Hope is natural to all, and the poet says: ' Auspicious hope! in thy sweet garden grow Wreaths for each toil, a charm for every woe.'" In Annie's artless conversation and unsophisticated nature, Delia found constant cause for gratitude, that she had been able to assist in the development and right direction of qualities, which otherwise might have been her bane. Throughout the summer she continued to attend to Annie's lessons, and in her rapid progress found herself amply repaid for her labor. In the au- tumn she made arrangements for her pupil to pursue her studies with the village pastor, Mr. Howe, it not being for many reasons desirable for' her to attend school. As she came, daily to Rosedale to practise her : music lessons, Mrs. Nortol still maintained the same confidential relations to her as formerly.   84       HERE AND HEREAFTER: But not alone to Annie Clarke was Mrs. Norton's kindness and generosity shown. The mamlnufacturing locality, to which had been one of their earliest drives, had since been frequently visited by her, and more than one family owed improvement in its condition to her kind suggestions and interested advice, and, where it was needed, more substantial aid also. Thus in acts of neighborly kindness and social intercourse, and hal- lowed domestic duties and pleasures, the summer months sped on, as months will speed to those whom love and duty alike prompt to a wise and systematic employment of time. The journey to the White Mountains, contem- plated in the early part of the season, had been given up, as Mr. Howard's health was too feeble to allow of his accompanying them, and no inducements could persuade his niece to leave the society of one who she foresaw would not long be spared to her. The bracing air of early autumn, however, invigorated Mr. Howard; and his health began to amend so that there was every prospect of his having a comfortable winter at least. While Delia Norton had been passing her first sum- mer in her pleasant country home, as has been de- scribed, Clara Fitzroy had spent hers in a continuous round of gayety; receiving visitors at home, and mak- ing occasional trips to watering-places or the sea-side. Although accustomed from her youth up to dissipation and frivolity, she had never before had any care save of herself, and now that, in addition to the no light tax of providing for her own numerous wants, she had also the superintendence of a large house, and the entertainment of company, she found herself at the close of the season, when fashion takes breath and retires to its home, or rather lodging-house, " completely fagged out," to use her own expression, and scarcely in a state, either pllysi-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       85 cal or mental, to look forward with pleasure to return- ing to the city and commencing a winter's campaign of parties, operas, concerts, theatres, lectures, &c., not to mention the important duty of shopping.  She had seen but little of Mrs. Norton, althou'gh she had occasionally sent for her for a morning visit in those rare intervals that intervened between the departure of one bevy of fashionable friends and the arrival of another. Late in the autumn, Delia received such a summons, written in evident haste and agitation. Wondering what could be the cause, she hastened to her cousin. She found her upon the bed, looking very pale and languid, and with traces of recent tears upon her face. Oc Delia, I am so glad you have come!  I have had such sad news from New York, and then, too, I was taken sick yesterday; not that I care so much for that, for now I must rest, and Fitzroy can't help it. Poor lMaria's lost her husband, Delia; - -he was out West and took passage from C  to   in one of those horrid high-pressure boats. There was no racing, they said, but the boiler burst, and most of the passengers were lost, he among them. He had gone out on one of his speculating trips. But that is not the worst; Maria's health has been miserable, you know, for some time. Living in that hot, crowded street, so different from what she had been accustomed to, has made her still worse; and now, mother, who has taken her to her boarding-house, says she is in a consumption, and can't live a  monith. Is n't it shocking? Mother writes to me to take Felice; she says she has more than she can bear, to be so anxious about Maria. But I can't, I'm, sure. I can't abide the child, and she 's done nothing but moan and fret for her father, since he died; and 8   86       HERE AND HEREAFTER. then if I was willing, Fitzroy would n't hear of it; he don't like children." Here Mrs. Fitzroy paused, from want of breath, appar- ently; for she sank back exhausted upon her pillow. Mrs. Norton, shocked and surprised at her intelli- gence, and her strange manner of communicating it, said: "What is to be done, Clara?" "I don't know, I'm sure. You always know, and so I sent for you. Fitzroy says the child had better be put to board with some good person, and I think it would be as well; only she is so strange, she would fret herself to death, perhaps." "O, that would be cruel," exclaimed Delia, involun- tarily. "Is Maria so very sick that there is no hope?" "None, - mother writes she is dreadfully emaciated and weak. O dear! I wish now I had gone to see her oftener before I was married; but you know, Delia, she was so overbearing I could never get on with her. If I was n't sick, I'd go to New York at once; but that can- not be now." Mrs. Norton made no answer, but thought of the strange contrasts in life: - Maria, but a few years since so haughty and self-reliant, so stylish and handsome, so much sought after in society, so wedded to fashion and pleasure,-now a dying widow, poor,-and, save her mother, almost friendless. Tears came to her eyes, and she sat silent so long, that her cousin moved uneasily, and said, almost pettishy: "Why don't you speak, De- lia? I thought if I sent for you, it would all be right, and my head aches so I'm sure I can't tell what to do." "Neither can I to-day, Clara; but I will come to see you again to-morrow, and perllhaps -in the mean time think of some plan. Take care of yourself, Clara, you look as if you needed it," -and with a preoccupied air she left.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       87 When her husband returned at night, Delia told him of her visit to Clara. His first words were: ' Poor Felice! It is so sad," he continued, " for any child to be left an orphan, even if the parents be not all one could desire. I am certain that neither Mrs. Grafton nor Mrs. Fitzroy can do jus- tice to that child's nature. Affections as deep and in- tense as hers appear to be, to judge from her love to her father, might surely, by a judicious hand, be guided into a good channel." There were a few moments of silence. At length Mrs. Norton, laying her hand upon her husband's arm, said: "Leslie, are you willing that I should take the child?" "You, Delia? how,- to adopt, or educate?" "I don't know. I should n't wish to pledge myself to anything, but I should like very much to take her for a time, and see what she is; and, if we find her tractable, give her a home, and take care of her."- Mr. Norton was silent. In all his pity for the child, this had not occurred to him. If ever, in his thoughts of a future happy home, children had. found a place, they had been his own, not the children of others, and t: those others persons whose way of life was so opposed to his. He feared that this child might prove a cause, if not of discord, at least of anxiety and care to them; but then other considerations came, of Christian duty, of an opportunity to do good, perhaps to save an im- mortal soul, and he said: "It is not for me to decide, Delia. The care and responsibility will be yours. If you wish to take her, do so; only this I advise, do not make any pledges for the future, till you have made the trial.' "I don't desire to, Leslie. I should like to ask   88       HERE AND HEREAFTER: Aunt Grafton to send her to me for the winter, and in the spring we can decide what it is best to do." "I am going to New York on business, you know, next week, when Adie returns home; she can come back with me, if her mother is willing to spare her." "Yes," replied Delia, and immediately withdrew to write to her aunt. Shle also sent a note to Clara, to in- form her of her plan and relieve her of any anxiety. Mr. Fitzroy was at home, and not in the best of hu- mor, when the note to his wife arrived; after reading it, he said: "Mrs. Norton probably expects you to take the child in the spring; it will be best for you to let her understand at once that that is out of the question." "I don't see why it should be out of the question," said Clara, annoyed by her husband's decided tone; "the child is my niece, and not Delia's!" "Simply because I don't choose to have my house made a foundling hospital, or my wife nurse to other people's children. It will take you long enough to get back your good looks," with a dissatisfied glance at her face, " without taking additional care upon you." "You spoke a week ago of taking your ward, little Elenore Clavers, into the family." "That is different; perhaps I shall do so yet. Ele- nore will have a maid and governess, and add to the eclat of our position, rather than detract from it." ' Yes, and be ten times the care and bother to me that my sister's child would," said Clara, in a perverse spirit of contradiction. Mr. Fitzroy was not absolutely unfeeling, although cold-hearted enough, and he really wanted his wife about again, her former handsome self, so he said good- humoredly: "Come, Clara, this is nonsense; you don't want the child any more than I do; and you know, if   I           OR, THE TWO -ALTARS.       89 we have little Elenore Clavers here, it will increase our income, as well as bring all her aristocratic relations to visit us; all you have to do is to acquiesce in Mrs. Nor- ton's plan, and mention incidentally that we are to take Miss Clavers into our family." " Well, I don't want either child, Mr. Fitzroy. I don't like such kind of care." "You will feel differently when you are well again, Clara; and it will add immensely to our position. These Boston people are terrible aristocrats, and if we have Elenore, we shall get into the highest charmed circle, and I see no reason why you should n't be on intimate terms with them all yet." Mrs. Norton made no comments, the next morning, when Clara told her of Miss Elenore Clavers's expected residence in the family, although she might have won- dered at her not mentioning it the day previous; but she at once understood that it was Mr. Fitzroy's influ- ence. Conscious, as she was, that her cousin was no fit guide for her niece, she thought the affair well settled. In a few days she received a letter from her aunt, filled with piteous complaints of her cares and troubles, and accepting her offer of taking the child. For the satisfaction of a young lady critic, who aver- red that Delia Arlington became altogether too perfect a character, and who begged that she might be allowed a few faults or weaknesses at least, it is as well to state here, that the resolution to which Mrs. Norton came, to take the orphan under her charge, was not arrived at without a good deal of struggle on her part.  In the first place, from Mrs. Fitzroy's representations of the child, she foresaw that she might be difficult to manage, and she dreaded the introduction of any one into their household, whose presence might jar upon their pres-   90       HERE AND HEREAFTER: ent perfect union. The care also she felt would be a good deal, - and then, too, the old feeling she had once entertained towards her cousin Maria rose up il her mind.  What if Felice should be like her? But tlhis last reason for not taking the child, however, proved the most powerful one in the end in her favor; for she had always reproached herself for her unchristian dis- like to her haughty, domineering cousin, and was grieved that this, as she supposed buried feeling, should rise from its ashes again to influence her against the per- formance of a good action.  Then she remembered Felice was an orphan; then the recollection of her own orphan days, in their first solitude and dreariness, and her unhappiness at her Aunt Grafton's, and the unl- willingness she had felt to remain there,--all these warmed her heart towards the desolate child of her dying cousin, and induced her to take the step at which at first she had revolted. It was her duty to do so, at least, and thus far in life she had found that, however disagreeable the performance of any duty might be, it eventually brought its own reward with it in an appror- ing conscience. But why, it may be asked, was it Mrs. Norton's duty to take charge of a child who lhad nearer relations, and those, too, amply able in a pecuniary point of view to take care of her? It was her duty, simply because she knew that neithler the child's grandmother nor aulnt would do for her highest interests as she would, that with them, though she might live in luxury and be clothed in splendor, though she might be taught all accomplislments and graces, her soul's lif6 would- be uncared for; her duty, because she was her brother's keeper ; her duty, because of the opportunity, - for God does not place opportullity in the way of his cllil-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        91 dren for them to give this and that reason for neglect- ing it. And so the struggle ended with Delia, in the deter- mination, if her husband approved, to offer to take care of Felice for the winter. That decided upon, she felt that she had only done what was right;   and found therein no occasion for self-laudation.  92       HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER IX. "All ye are brethren." "Entireness, illimitableness, is indispensable to Faith. ..... A faith that sets bounds to itself, that will believe so much and no more, that will trust thus far and no farther, is none." - AON. THE time was now fast approaching for Adie Lawton's return to New York, having passed a pleasant, and, it is to be hoped, a profitable summer in N--, with her friend, Mrs. Norton. In that charming rural town, she had come in contact with a greater variety of character than she had ever before met with, since her friends vis- iting acquaintances were not confined to a single set, as is generally and perhaps unavoidably the case in the city. In the country, where God lavishes his choicest bless- ings freely upon all, and where the population is com- paratively sparse, to set one's self upon a pinnacle of exclusiveness, and look with a cold and haughty mien upon a poorer neighbor, is arrogating to one's self a- great deal. Sucll a course frequently causes ill-will, dissen- sions, and heart-burnings, where might be harmonious union. The least that can be said of it is, that it is ab- surd. It is true, that there, as elsewhere, like seeks like for intimate companionship; but this fact need not prevent an interchange of neighborly offices and good- will between dwellers in the same community, particu- larly those of the same household of faith. To go to church and listen perhaps to an eloquent discourse upon the brotherhood of man, to join in prayer and praise to   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        93 God the Father in the name and as the disciples of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all mankind, follow ill the read- ing of the Scriptures, which represent him as the friend of publicans and sinners, and then go away with a look and manner which forbid all familiar approach or recognition, is, to say the least, a glaring inconsistency in professing Christians, although one sometimes very observable, whatever it may be called or considered in others. This, however, is an error or a vice into which neither Mr. nor Mrs. Norton was likely to fall; he, be- cause he was one of those true-souled men, far above such paltry distinctions in society, and she, because, whatever her natural tendencies may have been, and that she had some such weakness is not to be denied, had been too powerfully wroughllt upon by divine grace to retain such mistaken notions of her own individual worth or importance. Indeed, she had learned and daily strove to consider herself on a pilgrimage to heav- en with brothers and sisters, a band innumerable; the lowliest of whom here, she knew, might claim a higher place hereafter than she could aspire to. Adie Lawton, visiting, as she did, with her friends wherever they visited, and making their interests, as far IIl  as she could, hers also, was impressed with a greater in- dividuality in the people in the country than in those she had been accustomed to mingle with. Of course, in the city, where each circle is complete in itself, and there is no occasion to go out of it for society or good offices, she had only been in the way of meeting those of her own station in life, and the poor and friendless, whom hlle mother was interested in. Now, she was frequently as sociating with personsa of that large middle class which comprises within itself so much worth and uprightness (   "      HERE AND HEREAFTER: and intelligence and refinement, whom some of the Wealthy in not a few localities regard almost as pariahs in comparison with themselves, whose doors they never darken, and upon whom, when they chance to meet them in society or elsewhere, they do not deign to cast a look of recognition. The opportunity which she had of seeing a little more of life than hitherto had been her privilege, al- though she had not dreamed that this would be one of the advantages of a visit to a country town, had en- larged her ideas in many ways, and had shown her the injustice as well as the severity of some of her criticisms upon her kind. She was in the habit of going often to see Miss Ellis, and upon one such occasion she indulged rather freely in her old sarcasm, in commenting upon tlhe conduct and manners of some of the wealthy people of N   towards their less prosperous neighbors. The lady of Elm Hill, who was a woman of so much enlargement of thought and liberality of feeling, that she never liked to hear one class condemned for the acts of a portion of it, said: "Are you not sweeping in your remarks, Miss Adie? Wealth and refinement, and what you term absurd exclusiveness, are by no means indissoluble. True refinement, true liberal culture, that- is, Christian as well as intellectual, is never arr-ogant. It never fails to see, that there is a broad common ground, upon which all, high and low, rich and poor, may meet together and find that they have wants and interests and sympathies alike. True, the people you name are such as you describe them, - purse-proud, arrogant, su- percilious, and what not; it's no matter. They are few in number, and their assumed consequence is ridic- ulous enough, when it is remembered who they are and whence they came, and upon what they ground their   OR, T THE TWO ALTARS.      95 pretensions. But that's neither here nor there. They are what they are, and do not care to be different. You have seen that some of the most wealthy people in our town, the most cultivated and refined, are very different from them. They are people who show a Christian in- terest in their kind, and spend their money freely, and give their own labor and time to advance the general good of society, and have no sympathy at all with such nonsensical exclusivcneg',s." ' "But for all that, Miss Ellis, one can hardly help being vexed with such people." "Not at all, Miss Adie; that will do no good. The wiser course, it seems to me, is to look more on the other side of the picture. I prefer to have a good opin- ion, rather than a mean one, of my race." "But how can one get this good opinion, when one sees so much that is mean, selfish, and absurd, every day he lives?" '"For myself, Miss Adie, I find a good deal of satis- faction in studying the lives and characters of the great and wise and good, both among the living and among tlhe dead; those Christian men and women-saints, I had almost called them--who have blessed humanity most, and conferred the greatest honor upon it. They are the only true aristocrats in this or'in any other land. There have been and are among them men and women of wealth and refinement, and of distinguished talents and eminent positions, - as well as men and women in the more humble walks of life, - which they have con- secrated with a religious fidelity to the service of their race. There, has never been any lack of sympathy be- tween such persons and those in whose interests they toiled and suffered." "But such persons, I suppose, engaged in such labors   96       HERE AND HEREAFTER: from a sense of duty, and not from any particular sym- pathy with the destitute and suffering and depraved; certainly not at first." " But why need you suppose any such thing? Duty, a sense of duty merely, never yet saved the poor and downtrodden, brought joy into the places of mourning, or converted the heathen. I tell you, nothing but Chris- tian love and sympathy can do this, for nothing else can reach the heart; and those who possess these graces, which are the gift of the Holy Spirit, have the power of acting upon others for their good, and oftentimes dis- covering qualities in them which are hidden from gen- eral or indifferent observation. They find diamonds and pearls where others see only charcoal and oysters." "But," said Adie, laughing, " every piece of charcoal is not a diamond, and every oyster does n't contain a pearl; so what then?" "Then my illustration does n't hold; for I maintain that every human soul is a diamond or a pearl of greater or less value, however it may be treated as though it was a worthless thing. I have lived long enough in the world, if you have not, to make the dis- covery that our Heavenly Father has not bestowed all his best gifts upon any one portion of his children. You will find in the middle and lower walks of life, as they are called, an innate refinement, pure and noble aspira- tions, disinterested affections, and often gifts of an intel- lectual kind, which only need cultivation to give to their possessors a distinguished place among the great and good of all ages." "I don't doubt that, Miss Ellis; but these gifts and qualities are too often left buried in a napkin.' "I know it, and alas for the world that it is so! But as I was just now saying, something more than a sense   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.,       97 of duty is needed in such labors and sacrifices as distin- guished those who have earned for themselves the title of the world's benefactors, - such men as Oberlin, and Howard, and Edwards, and Judson, and Tuckerman; and such women as Elizabeth Fry, and Mary Ware, and Dorothea Dix, and scores of such, whom I might name, and whose biographies it does one good to read, so much do they enlarge our conceptions of the greatness and worth and dignity of our own natures, when fully under the control of the Christian religion. But, bless my heart, Miss Adie!" said Miss Ellis, pausing suddenly in her vigorous march up and down her sitting-room, "I hope I have n't tired you out. I never made such a speech before. I hope you are convinced that it was something more than a sense of duty which actuated those whom all Christian people delight to honor, in their labors, and that I have n't spent all my breath in vain. And do not forget this, that the higher the culture and the greater the refinement, if it only be Christian, the more wealth," "I suppose I must give up the point, Miss Ellis," said Adie, archly, " particularly as I meant' to say the same thing myself, only I prefer to hear you say it. But you make one very important condition, that it shall be Christian refinement and culture; what then do you expect of all those people who lack that quality?" "That," replied Miss Ellis, bluntly, " they will go on their way till some terrible calamity brings them to their senses, or till they go down to the pit of their own digging." "You are severe now, Miss Ellis. It is not such an easy thing for all to become Christians. There are ob- stacles in the way of the most sincere seekers." 9   VO      HlERE AN  H IJKJBiATliK ; "Obstacles that might be brushed away as easily as a cobweb from the wall, if people would use the reason and philosophy they employ to mystify themselves with, in finding out the truth. But pray what are your ob- stacles9 " "They are many. The principal one is the difficulty I have in accounting to my own mind how it is that God can be good, and the actual state of the world what it is,---how God can be a being of infinite love and holiness, and his intelligent and responsible children so sinning and erring, so weak and imperfect; why it is that the good suffer, and the wicked are blessed; why the earth is so beautiful, and man so evil. God permits all this; nay, God ordains it." "-God ordains evil, Miss Adie?" "Well, permits then; I said permits first. I can't understand this terrible condition of human society." "You understand the works of your fellow-creatures, I suppose?" answered Miss Ellis, with a grim severity of manner which put Adie at once upon her strictest attention "If you go into a printing-office, paper-mill, cotton-factory, or machine-shop, you understand at once  everything you see there; not only all the relations ex-  isting between cause and effect, but also precisely what  kind of machinery is used, and how it operates to pro-  duce a given result?" "No, I can't say I do, Miss Ellis; but perhaps I might by studying it out."     :: "Strange you should n't see through it all at once, without study, or at least with only a few idle specula-  tions and wonders. That's the way you expect to  understand your Heavenly Father's works."  "O no, Miss Ellis, I do not. -Besides, all Christians ii say we must have faith; although there is not much  -,           ** " 8y      :   ORB THE TWO ALTARS.       99 that we can understand, we should nevertheless be- lieve." "I think so, surely," answered Miss Ellis, dryly. "If you employ a master-builder to erect for you a house, and after he has commenced his job, you go to see how he is getting-on, and notice the confusion and disorder which prevails; bricks here, mortar there, stones else- where, fragments of wood, huge beams, marble and soap-stone, iron and clay, would you not say there was an exceedingly misshapen mass of material for the work which he had undertaken? as much without form and void as was this fair earth on which we dwell, before the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters?" "Certainly I should; but I should consider the man knew what he was about, and would in due time bring order out of confusion. Indeed, I should see as he progressed with his undertaking that he was doing it." "And you would have faith in him, that man of plans and tools, and brick and mortar, that he would build you a comely and substantial house, because such was his business, and you could see that the work was going on?"  "Yes, certainly." "And none, Miss Adie, in the Almighty Architect, because you are unable to understand how his works are proceeding, or what progress may be made within the limited circle of your vision, while yet you can dis- cern evidences of love and goodness and wisdom all around you? You have had a good education?" "Yes, ma'am, tolerably, for a young lady." Studied botany, natural history, and astronomy?" 'Yes, ma'am; I think I see now how your argument tends. I have never failed to see a master hand in all the wonderful bbjects with whichh these sciences have   100      HERE AND HEREAFTER: made me acquainted. I have no difficulty in believing in an Almighty Creator, but in the doctrine that God is always present with us and around us, and beholds us in all our actions; for if he is an infinitely wise and holy and good God, would he suffer sin so much to abound? And then it is hard to conceive how such a  being can condescend to us i"  "Is the creature greater than the Creator? Did we not just now agree, that the more Christian one is, the . more easy is it for him to sympathize with the suffering  and wretched? But you do not understand my argu- ment; it may be only a woman's argument, but I can't  help it if it is; it may not be any the worse for that. I know your difficulty. I have felt it myself, and I have : heard it again and again from others, who, like you, : lack faith. My present object is to increase your faith,  or to endeavor to. In botany and natural history, to leave astronomy untouched, as too grand a subject for i our feeble comprehension to meddle with, you have seen the wonderful adaptation of plants and insects to their uses and habits of life; you have seen and have bent in awe at the wonders in a single simple flower, or the  curious and inimitable structure of an insect, so small  as to require the use of a magnifying-glass to examine g it minutely?" "Yes, often; I begin to understand you now, Miss Ellis."'  "Yes, you have seen and thought of these things, and although your mind is filled with amazement at the structure of the least of God's creatures, you have ex-  pected to fathom his plans with respect to man,--a being made after his own image, and whose destiny is ever-  lasting life. You lave seen that the little flower is  formed and placed how and where the ends of its crea- gg   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      101 tion shall be best accomplished; that the insect of an hour is so created that that hour shall be one of happi- ness, and yet you doubt whether God can condescend to you, so much nobler than either! But how is this whole matter treated by our Saviour, in language so grandly simple that the heart must be -callous indeed which is not affected by it: ' Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith!' I declare to you, Miss Adie, in hours of despondency, when my Father has seemed unapproachable to me, I have found un- speakable comfort in that text, even while I felt myself rebuked by it." For some moments both were silent. Miss illis's words had not been so very forcible, perhaps, in them- selves, nor had her arguments been stated with any- thing like logical precision or cogency; but her manner had been so sincere, so severely earnest,.that a deep and abiding impression was made on Adie, whose moral and intellectual maladies needed strong remedies. Such was her present state of mind, that words of gentle pleading would have but little effect upon her. When at length she spoke, it was to say: "You have expe- rienced doubts, Miss Ellis, similar to those which I feel?" "I have; and who, that thinks seriously, has not at one time or another? But long since I have passed out of that fog of uncertainty; and now the sun is ever bright to the eye of my faith. I am a believer now. I have learned, and that too by experience, that if Chris- 9*   102      HERE AND HEREAFTER: tians suffer, they have joys the world knows not of. I have seen, that if the wicked are seemingly prosperous, and come to wealth and honor and fame, they have seasons of terrible remorse; and I am well convinced that even in this world there is a more equable distribu- tion of good and evil than appears to be the case to a superficial observation. But suppose, Miss Adie, there was not; if this life is a preparation for another, what matters present suffering, provided only the end be at- tained? I dare say, when a child, you underwent some J discomfort and some positive suffering in obtaining your  education. If you were going to a foreign land, and  had but a limited time to learn the language and be-  come acquainted with the customs of the people, you would be obliged to labor very hard to accomplish that object, and become weary and exhausted in your prep- arations; so if you have before you some cherished pur,  pose, you would not consider the hardships and sufferings to which it would subject you. Why, then, I ask, should  there be this perpetual wail about the sufferings of the  good, and the prosperity of the wicked, when both are,  must be, from the very nature of the human soul, most-  ly outward, for no earthly joys can equal the peace God hath prepared for them that love him; and no misery can be conceived of greater than that which the con- science-stricken sinner endures. And let human condi- tion on this earth be what it may, is there not an eter- nity in which God will balance all accounts with his  creatures?                     ?! "I have listened to arguments like these a great  many times before, Miss Ellis; but they never had the effect on my mind which what you have now said has produced," answered Adie, with considerable feeling. "I have naturally a volatile disposition; but thought-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       103 less as I seem, I have my hours of serious reflection- and I do not hesitate to confess to you that I am not content to be as I am. I do not think a simply moral life sufficient for the wants and the sins of the soul. But I have hitherto found it hard to be other than I am. My mind dwells perpetually upon some of the great themes of religion; there is always an undercur- rent of thought with me, of which they are the chief staple. Since what you have said to me, I think I shall henceforth read the New Testament and human life with new feelings and a new understanding, for you have furnished me with a key to some of the mysteries in both; and yet, as I just now said, your arguments are not new to me. I must go now," at the same time rising. "I thank you, Miss Ellis, for this morning's conversation." And the two parted cordially. That visit seems to have been the turning-point in life with Adie; for when a few months later, previous to her marriage, she made public profession of her faith, she wrote to Miss Ellis, that she had been in a large measure the means of re- moving her doubts, and establishing her in the belief and hopes of the Christian religion. This result was not an instantaneous one of course. Her mind was then set to work in the right direction and in earnest, and in due time she was able to see clearly where before there was much darkness and uncertainty to her.    104       HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER X. "If the Devil ever laughs, it must be at hypocrites; they are the greatest dupes he has; they serve him better than any others, and receive no wages; nay, what is still more extraordinary, they submit to greater mortifications to go to hell, than the sincerest Christian to go to heaven." - COLTON. THE writer of this story is well aware that no favor can be expected from some young lady readers, if How- ard Leslie is longer suffered to remain in the back- ground, entirely kept out of sight by its prominent married personages; and although it is not its purpose to give his life, love, and its sequel, yet as he was, in re- ality a frequent and ever-welcome visitor at Rosedale, it may be as well to allow him now to appear in front of' the stage, that we may listen again to his frank, cheer- ful voice, and see if the " boy was father to the man." In a distant part of the grounds of Rosedale, through which was a path which led from a railroad station near by to the house, was a pond as yet in a state of nature; that is, with no smooth flagged walk around it, but, on the contrary, rough stones, willows, bushes, and weeds, lying and growing as nature placed them. It so chanced,  one autumn evening about sunset, that Howard Leslie took this path to Mr. Norton's; and as he came towards  the pond, he espied something green and white am6ng  the high bushes and willow-trees, which grew thick on one side. His curiosity was aroused. It was not the season for water-lilies, and had it been, this was a giant of its species. Was it -a swan recently placed - i    OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      105 there? No, swans do not have green. wings. So, walk- ing along on the edge of the pond, now quite full from recent rains, he came towards the object of his curi- osity, which all at once rose and appeared full in view, neither lily nor swan, but, to his astonished gaze, as lovely and graceful as both,-a fair and beautiful young girl dressed in white with a green shawl and green ribbons in her large hat, and who looked as surprised to see him as he was at meeting her. Whether the young gentleman was embarrassed or overpowered with so much beauty is not known, but certain it is that in a hasty motion forward he stepped upon a loose stone of some size, which, turning, slipped from under his feet, and the next moment he was in the water; not in the most graceful of attitudes either. As in duty bound, the young girl, Annie Clarke, gave a slight scream, and then came forward to see if her assistance was needed; but our younng Leander had speedily extricated himself from his predicament, and came out of his impromptu bath, minus his hat, and plus considerable mud and dirt. Neither his presence of mind nor his native liveli- ness deserted him, however; for with a graceful bow, and pointing to his hat, which was quietly floating off, he said: "I beg your pardon; you see my hat is off already. I did not intend to interrupt you." "No apology is required, sir." "You are gathering autumn flowers I see, and I will no longer intrude." And, with another low bow, he turned to the path, with an air as courtly as if he had not been well spat- tered with mud, hatless, and dripping. Arrived at Mr. Norton's in this condition, he somewhat astonished his cousin and Madam Norton, who were sitting by the window. !   HERE AND HEREAFTER: " Your most obedient, sister mine. I was not aware before that you kept water-nymphs at Rosedale. An encounter with one has just now proved all but my death. 'For my own part I have not a case of lives,' and I would thank your ladyship to be less hospitable in your entertainments hereafter." And with a comical sigh, Howard stood outside the door below the piazza, while Delia begged an explana- tion, which he gave after his characteristic fashion. " You must have seen Annie Clarke," said Delia; " she left but half an hour since." "I don't know who she was, in the flesh or out of it: 'The most peerless piece of earth, I think, That e'er the sun shone bright on."' "'Rolling stones gather no moss,' says the proverb, nor do they support fascinated young men, it seems," said Delia. "Had you not missed your footing, my pretty water-nymph would never have troubled you, Sir Howard; but as you've been duly punished, lost your hat and your nymph, go up into your room, and we will see if we can find any dry garments for you." "Very well; but suppose you send an ambassador extraordinary after my hat, unless indeed it be required to propitiate the nymph whom I disturbed. Hats are conveniences, and I really did not bring another for a change. Careless in me, but I did n't, nevertheless." "Why, where is yours? and why did you not bring it back yourself? " " I left it in the middle of the pond, floating as dream- ily on as if it had the owner's brains beneath its brim, and was lost in some deep reverie.  I didn't care to repeat my exploits before yon lady of the lake, and so walked on as unconsciously as if hats were a superfluity to my cranium."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS._  Oi 107 Notwithstanding Howard's pretended terror of the pond and its nymph, it was observed with some amuse- ment by the young mistress of Rosedale, that he always came after that by way of the lane, when he left the cars; but if his object was to meet Annie Clarke again, he was always unsuccessful. She never after loitered for flowers at sunset by Willow Pond. But the young girl's adventures for the day were not over, when she left Mr. Norton's grounds hastily, and took a secluded road, that was also a shorter way home, which she felt anxious to reach. She had not walked far, when she heard a voice behind her saying: "Good evening; it is quite too late for so lovely a girl tcr be alone. Allow me to escort you to the end of the lane." She turned and saw the same person of whom she had spoken to Mrs. Norton, and whose sinister, if hand- some, features inspired her with dread. She had, as all pure-minded young girls have, a native dignity, which should be their shield from insult, and she said coldly: " I thank you, but I have no fears, and prefer to walk alone." "I could not think of allowing it; such beauty must not go unattended; you are but a child, and need a protector always; let me be one to you; take my arm." And as he spoke, the man approached very near to the now terrified girl. She did not shrink, but she said in a voice of suppressed agony, while her face was as pale as death: " 0, sir, let me go. Do not torment me." " Torment you, angel! I would make you happy; it is in my power; take my arm, and as we go, I will tell you how."  108      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "On your peril, Leonard Fitzroy, lay but a finger on that innocent young girl. Yes, you may well start,- you did not expect me to be here, - but God protects the innocent. I am Emily Anstrice Ellis, if you have forgotten, and I am this young girl's relative and friend. Any offers of protection you have to make to her are best made to me, or to Mrs. Leslie Norton." Through the branches of the trees shone the last rays of the setting sun, and they gleamed on Annie's pale face, as if in benediction, as she clung to Miss Ellis's arm, while that lady stood erect, stern, and indignant, confronting the man, who was standing under the shade of a tree, his countenance betraying the mingled emo- tions of shame, rage, and mortification which agitated him. "Annie, go home now as fast as you can. No, Mr. Fitzroy," as that gentleman (?) began to move off also, though in an opposite direction, "I have a few words to say to you. It is many years since we have met, and this is not of my seeking; but since we have met I have a word to say to you. I know you, and the manner of your past life; and I bid you beware how you attempt to speak to that young girl again. Go home to your wife, Sir, and leave the innocent alone." ' You speak with authority, madam,' was the sneer- ing reply; " years ago, I believe I relinquished any claim you had upon me." "Such taunts and references have no power over me," replied Miss Ellis, in a calmer tone than she had yet used. "I never loved you, Leonard Fitzroy, as you well know, man of optward show and sham,-of in- ward vileness and duplicity. I pity you, for the terrible day of reckoning which will come to you sooner or later. I know you have come to live in N , despite   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      109 the fact of our residence here, my brother's and mine,-- despite the knowledge you had that his life was blighted by your sister. I do not wish to injure you, unless you try your serpent arts upon innocence; if you do this again, I will expose you as you are,--and though your fashionable friends may now have their suspicions, which they do not care to give utterance to, even your wealth and your fine house, carriage, and table shall not save you, when men shall come to know you as I do. Virtue still survives in some hearts. Will you cease to molest Annie Clarke?"  "My good lady, you who have so kindly constituted yourself my mentor, do not give yourself any uneasiness about yonder pretty country maiden. My tastes are too fastidious to be so easily satisfied, and to know that she is under the protection of a lady who once honored me with her-"  He paused and looked at Miss Ellis, but she was unmoved as before, and he added, - " inter- est," -not daring to say love, as he had intended,- "is sufficient for me. Have you any more words of counsel, my good madam?  My wife, for whom you have so much solicitude, is expecting me home." "I have nothing more to say to you, Leonard Fitz- roy," was the reply, in a tone as calm and unruffled as if theirs had been an ordinary interview. And with a low bow of mock reverence on his part, and a slight haughty inclination of the head on hers, they parted; yet not without, on both sides, more feel- ing than was manifested. It was true, as Miss Ellis had said,-it was not Leon- ard Fitzroy whom she had loved; nevertheless, his was the form and face where had been enshrined the ideal of her early, only love, and she could not thus meet him face to face, and hear again the sound of his voice, 10   1lJV      HiE  JU A-NJt D BtABt'Lt XF --that voice whose tones had once vibrated upon her heart in the sweet music of affection, - without some shock to her feelings. Nor was this all; Miss Ellis had cultivated the higher qualities of her character to such good purpose, that, even with the righteous indignation which she felt against the sin, she could not but pity the sinner. Such a moral wreck too, as he, her former lover, had made of himself! -he by nature so largely en- dowed, so capable of lofty purposes and noble acts,- now a mere worldly man, and that too in its worst sense, --giving himself up to the indulgence of his- unholy passions, - knowing but one check, and that the pitiful one of public condemnation. As she thought of these things, strong woman though she was, with characteris- tics called masculine, she could have wept like a child, in the tenderness and compassion of her heart. Well  might the poet say she thought, in view of man's capabil- ities and abuse of them, "How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,  Y  How complicate, how wonderful, is man! Dim miniature of greatness absolute I An heir of glory! a frail child of dust! Helpless immortal! Insect infinite! A worm! a God!" Little time, however, had this energetic woman to spend in sorrowful reverie. With one deep sigh she strove to banish again the long buried past, and went on her way to overtake Annie Clarke, with whom she wished to speak. Annie was watching from a window, expecting her, and came out as she approached the house. She at once took the young girl's hand, and with a tenderness unusual to her said: "My poor child, let this be a warning to you, to avoid lonely walks. God has given you a fair face, not for a snare   va owI, I 'WO ALTARS.     " but for a blessing; for unspeakablie i good done by beauty, if it is but the outward showing of the soul. It has power to touch the coldest heart. In me you have a friend on whom, you may rely, if you ever need one, or. a home,---a friend too who has some right to be such, for we are distantly related. No," in answer to Annie's start of surprise, , I know you were not aware of it, but so it is. Good night, child; you are too young to know the dangers that beset your path. Confide in your friends, and God bless you." Annie tried to speak, but her recent terror and her present surprise at Miss Ellis's kind and gentle manner, so affected her that she could only stammer through her tears:!"Thank you, O thank you, Miss Ellis!" Meantime, Mr. Fitzroy, a prey to conflicting passions, pursued his way homeward.   At first, anger and morti- fication had the ascendency over him; anger that he was foiled in his nefarious purpose by a woman, and that woman a meddlesome old maid, as hoe contemptuously termed hey between his set teeth, whose love he had once cast aside; mortification that he, usually so choice, so respectable in the indulgence of his vices, should have been so fally exposed in the attempted prosecution of them. But as  le reviewed all the circumstances of the late unwelcome interview, there recurred to him Miss Ellis's words, "I pity you for the terrible day of reckon- ing which will come to you, sooner or later." Wlat if it was really true, he thought, that there would be a day of reckoning at last, and he with all his sins upon his head should be called into the presence of his Maker and Judge! lie heard such doctrine preached almost every Sabbath, but he never thought of heeding it; for religion, its warnings and encouragements, were not for him, or such as he,-the prosperous, the favored!   "2      HERE AND HEREAFTER: And then, too, was he not as good as hundreds of his acquaintances, whose respectability the world never ques- tioned? should he be diverted from his purpose by a few slirewish words from a woman,-and that woman? But here, instead of the picture of Miss Ellis as she now was, with little to attract the interest of a man of the world, came, all unbidden, that of the Emily Ellis of his youth, - of his days of comparative innocence and rectitude, - days when his first sin had been slighting her love. A beautiful vision of youth and innocence and en- gaging charms rose before him, all brightened by the pure affection which shone out of those deep blue eyes. This affection he had voluntarily crushed and blighted. And how had it been with him since! As he reviewed flirtation after flirtation, in which he had been engaged, -for he had all his days held woman's heart but as the plaything of an hour to be toyed with, and then cast aside, its freshness and beauty for ever gone out of it, - as he thought of deeper errors and darker sins against society, plhantoms rose up before him of various shape and mien, some pale and haggard, with faces of woe, say- ing, "You brought us to this ; others bold and flaunt- ing in the gay livery of vice, who jeeringly said, "Go with us to the pit you have helped us to dig," he almost repented him of the evil he had done, and almost shuddered at the thoughts of his heart towards Annie Clarke. At this juncture, however, his reverie was interrupted by a loud: "What the deuce's to pay, Fitzroy? -turn- ing Methodist, and saying your prayers on the way-side, man? or got the blue devils? I never saw a fellow look so black in all my days. Come, I, came out last train purpose to try your horse, Lady Clare, you boast so much of; did n't find you at the house, and, as I was   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      113 half sure I saw you get into the. car front of me, came out to beat the bush for you. If I 've broken in at a wrong time, you 'll excuse me, I know, and I 'll leave you to your meditations or repentance." These words were spoken by a man about thirty, whose whole air and manner betokened him to belong to the same class as Fitzroy, who, upon the close of this address, said angrily: "Nonsense, Clapham, can't a man have business troubles on his mind in these curs- edly hard times?" "I faith," was the answer, "I have enough of the sort; but your face looked like that of a remorseful penitent, as far as I can judge how one would look." "Go to the devil, will you, with your comparisons. I advise you, Clapham, to take out your pocket-glass and study your own face; mine is not an open book to be read by every one." "I' faith, not a bad idea that, Fitzroy, as I know at least it's a devilish good-natured one, which is a com- pliment yours does not deserve at this moment." We will not follow these gentlemen (?) further in their conversation, which was plentifully -interlarded with oaths and unmeaning expletives. Leonard Fitz- roy's penitence and remorse vanished before his com- panion's manner as speedily as the morning dew before the sun. The worthy pair went to Oak Park to dine, drink, smoke, and try Lady Clare and Snowdrop, two favorite saddle-horses of the host. 10*   "4      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XI.

WITH some anxiety Delia Norton awaited her hus- band's return from New York, whither he had gone upon business, having also escorted Adie Lawton home, and designing to bring back the little Felice. When at last they arrived, and she, having welcomed her hus- band after his first absence, turned to the child, she was touched with her desolate and resigned air and manner, like that of a victim led to the slaughter. She spoke to her in the kindest tones. When she stooped to kiss her, the poor girl opened her large black eyes in sur- prise, and suffered herself to be kissed, without, however, returning the caress. The little orphan said nothing that day except in replies to questions asked, and then in as few words as possible, sometimes in French, some- times in English, and again in a mixture of both. She appeared to regard the preparations which had been made for her comfort with astonishment and curiosity, but made no comments. At night, when Mrs. Norton accompanied her to the little room allotted to her, and asked if she would like to say her prayers to her, she answered, "Non, non," very decidedly. "But you will say them to yourself then," she said, "and thank God for giving you a safe journey, and ask himn to take care of your mamma ?"   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      115 She replied: "Felice never did at home. What's the use?" "4 God requires it; if you have any good friends on earth, you like to thank them for their kindness, don't you?" "Felice has none d'amis." And covering her head with the bed-clothes, she so evidently signified her wish to be left alone, that Mrs. Norton, merely saying, "O yes, you have many, and God above all," left her, uncertain what should be her next step. The following day she was a little more communica- tive when spoken to, but did not volunteer any remarks. She was a singular-looking child too, dark, sallow, thin, with large eyes and a wide mouth, and none of the playful ways of her age about her,-- she appeared as if she never smiled. Mrs. Norton tried to discover what her amusements had formerly been; but she seemed averse to speaking of her home at all. At length, she proposed to her to go and see her Aunt Clara, who, she said, was too unwell to come to her. "Non, non;" was the vehement reply. ' Eelice n'aime pas Aunt Clara." "But she is your own aunt, and will be very kind to- you." "Non, non. Felice don't care." At last, Mrs. Norton ventured to ask some questions about her father. She looked up with an expression of anger and defi- ance upon her face, but reading only pity and love in that gazing upon her, she hung her head and burst into tears. "O mon pere, mon cher pere! 'Oh! oh! what will Felice do?    "6      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "Did you then love your father so very dearly, my poor child?" asked Mrs. Norton, drawing her close to her, and smoothing her dark hair fondly. "Felice never did love any one else but mon cher pere. Anybody else never did love Felice; and he did, O so much!" "You mean, my dear, no one ever showed so much love for you as your father; your mother loves you i always." "Je ne sais pas. Mamma never looked so she did; but he, O mon cher pAre! he talked and acted he loved Felice. I heard some peoples say, I dark, ugly, and sullen. Felice didn't care while mon cher pore was here." "But, Felice, you must not think that no one cares for you now that your father is dead. You have friends, and it is in your own power to make more, and then you always have God, who is your Heavenly Father. You know the prayer is, ' Our Father who art in heav- en,' - our Father! yours and mine and everybody's; and then he is so wise and holy that he knows what is good for all his children." "Felice never knew the prayers. If God so bon, why make to die mon cher pre, -all Felice had to love?" "Ah, dear child, neither you nor I can tell why God permits his children to have so much sorrow, but we must have faith in him. I will read to you about the Saviour he sent to us. When you know your Heavenly Father better, although you can never understand him fully, you will learn to believe that he knows best what is good for us. If you will only always remember that God is your Heavenly Father, and that he loves you far more than your earthly father could, you will feel much happier than you now do."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       117 Felice shook her head, and raised her large eyes to her unwearied friend with a sad look which touched her heart. At present all she could say was, to repeat: "Why did God make to die mon cher pore?" But the right chord had been struck ; and it was not long before Mrs. Norton found her morning and evening at her side, eager and ready for the simple Bible lessons, which always turned upon the love of God as a father,- she, the fatherless one, who had loved her earthly parent so tenderly, could understand God in that relation; and although she, like other thoughtful children, often asked questions which a theologian could not have answered, her kind and patient teacher was generally able to satis- fy her by allusions to the faith she had had in her father on earth, and telling her that the same was required towards her Father in heaven.- One night, after the child had been listening with un- usual interest to some illustration of divine love, she said, abruptly: "Mamma Delie," (a name she adopted of her own accord,) " does my sick mamma know all this about the good God, and how happy all good people will be in heaven?" "Yes, my dear, I hope she does."' "But Felice knows she don't, because she so triste, --she so malheureuse. Plait il, will you write to her about le bon Dieu, - le beau ciel?" ' I will write for you, Felice; it shall be your letter." "O, vous 'etes tres bonne, ma chere maman Delie!" And she was restless until Mrs. Norton sat down at her desk, pen and paper before her. Here she seemed for a moment lost in thought; at length she began to dictate, - "Ma chere mere." "I would write in English, my dear, - your mother would prefer it." "Oui, oui. I forgot."   "8      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "My dear mamma, --I hope you very much better than when Felice came away. Will you please ask grandmamma to read to you in the good Bible about the Father, our Father in heaven? Then I know you will be glad to go to Him, and not be so sorry any more. "Good by, from your little daughter, "FELICE." "Shall I not write, Affectionate little daughter, Fe- lice?" The child paused a moment, and then said: ' Did you not tell me, Mamma Delie, to be true always,- act and talk true?  "Yes, certainly." "Then Felice cannot say affectionate, for,". lowering her voice, "Felice afraid she loves mamma very little, only more than she did at home; perhaps," reading at once the grave look that rested upon her, " the next letter, Felice will say that other word." Alas, the next letter never was written! and Mrs. Lascelles never saw the first simple and affecting one; for when it arrived she had gone to her Father and Judge,-- gone from a world where she had enjoyed little, to another for which she had made no prepara- tion. A hemorrhage of the lungs had terminated her life suddenly, and she drew; her last breath with her worldly mother and her hired nurse at her bedside, and no one to utter a prayer for her .departing spirit. So died Maria Lascelles, - a sad wreck in form and feature of the beautiful, admired, and haughty Maria Grafton! , She who had once trod the earth as if dis- daining its contact, now to lie down upon its breast in the long, dark sleep of death! She whose pride had   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       119 gone before destruction and whose haughty spirit before a fall, now dust to dust, ashes to ashes was all that re- mained! She who had been so remiss in a daughter's duties that even her weakly, indulgent mother felt little more grief for her death than the natural emotion such an event always calls forth; she who had shown so little love for her child as to induce none in return from that affectionate young heart; she who had never known the exquisite pleasure of giving a cup of cold water to one of Christ's little ones; whose ear had been shut to the cry of the needy, and the idol of whose wor- ship had been self- self- always self, - she had gone to render an account of her stewardship! And how- many yearly like Maria Lascelles go to meet the bride- groom, with no oil in their lamps and no wedding gar- ment on! Partial friendship, or obedience to the poet's injunction, c Tread lightly o'er the ashes of the dead,' may write obituaries, and discover all the virtues of the Christian character in such, but the fact remains,-- they were bidden to the marriage supper, and yet pre- pared not their wedding garments. It is not for us to determine their future destiny, but in view of the oft- repeated assertion in Scripture, that God is a being of justice as well as of mercy, we may tremble and take to ourselves salutary lessons upon the departure of any such neglectful soul from earth, - and watch and pray lest the bridegroom come when we are unaware and our lamps are gone out. A few tears Felice shed, when told of her mother's death, and she said she was sorry she could not have read her letter; but she exhibited no such deep grief as she still evinced at times for her father's loss. But the tender plant, whose clinging tendrils had been so cruelly torn from its first- support, had begun to twine again   120      HERE AND HEREAFTER: around the objects of affection in her new home. -Par- ticularly her heart went out to Mamma Delie and Uncle Howard. In fact, as the winter advanced, she passed a good deal of her time with Mr. Howard, loving to sit upon a cricket at his feet and listen to his cheerful stories of his childhood, or his gentle words of counsel to be good, and do good, and her Heavenly Father would take care of the rest. Mr. Norton, notwithstanding his kindness to her, she could never be prevailed upon to call by any other name than Uncle Leslie. It almost seemed as if she was jealous lest she might be induced to bestow upon him the love belonging to her deceased father. Althougli Mrs. Norton found herself amply repaid for taking the child, by her affection and general docility and her rapid improvement, there were times when her violent temper, which very early began to manifest itself, gave her a good deal of trouble. The child, too, had strong antipathies, and she never could be persuaded to regard her Aunt Clara with anything like affection. These antipathies extended also to others. There was a young girl in the house, as chambermaid at that tim e, and from the first she took a dislike to her. One day the girl was sick up stairs, and Mrs. Norton at dessert told Felice to carry her up some pudding, as she wished early to accustom her to render kind services to those in an inferior position in life to herself. To her surprisc, Felice, generally so obliging and active, said: "I don't want to, Mamma IDelie." But upon Mrs. Norton's repeating the request in a tone which indicated that it was a command, she got up, took the plate, marched to the door of the room where the girl was, and, throwing it upon the floor with all her force, said, "There's your dinner", and walking down again, she made her appearance in the   OR; THE TWO ALTARS.      -121 dining-room, ner usually pale cheeks all in a glow, and her eyes sparkling with rage. Mrs. Norton, who had heard the crash, said: "Did you let the plate fall, Felice?"  "No, I threw it down," she answered, with a defiant air. When, some hours later, Mrs. Norton sought the child in her room, whither she had been sent to think over her conduct, she could not for some time make her say that she was sorry, except for having displeased her; for the act itself she would express no penitence, until she wrought upon her sympathies by describing the girl's lonely situation. After telling her that her father was dead, and her mother obliged to work hard for a living, she concluded by asking her if she did not think she ought to try and make her happy, and not add to her misfortunes. Felice was moved, and said she would go and tell Hannah she was sorry, which she did imme- diately.  Afterwards she said to mamma Delia: "I was sorry I was unkind, because she  has no father; but Felice never can like Hannah." And she was true to her first feeling. While the girl remained in the family, which was only during the win- ter, she took every opportunity to do her a kindness, but it was as one takes a disagreeable dose of medicine. Mrs. Norton afterwards discovered that Hannah was de- ceitful, and not trustworthy, and that Felice had early seen something which set the tide of her strong feelings against her. For weeks Mrs. Fitzroy was an invalid, confined to her room, and mostly to her bed. Her husband chafed under this interruption to his dinner-parties and even- ing entertainments far more than he regretted his wife's sickness. At last, however, she so far recovered as to "   1l2i      HERE AND HEREAFTER: be able to remove to the city, and recommence a life of gayety and dissipation, - for staid old city as Bos- ton is, compared with New York, there are to be found even there abundant opportunities for wearing out one's health, and ruining one's .moral sensibilities, even where one is not supposed to be in society on account of mourn- ing. True, she was not as brilliant as formerly, but though often pale and haggard at home, she generally looked well in the evening, and Mr. Fitzroy was, upon the whole, pretty well satisfied; and she, on her part, was so successful in driving away thought, that she really fancied she was happy; at least she told her cousin she was so, on one of the few visits which the latter made to her in the course of the winter. Upon Delia's saying to her she looked unwell and dispirited, "La, child," she answered, "you're always fancying I 'm ailing. I'm well enough and happy, yes, as happy as I ever shall be. Why not?" casting her eyes as she spoke about her elegantly furnished chamber, which opened into a large drawing-room. "I do as I please, - no care,--no anxiety, and have everything I wish for. To be sure, I do dread going to N  in the spring and having so much company again; and most of all I dread having that little upstart, Miss Clavers, in the family." "Why do you then, Clara? Surely you are under no obligations to do so; your health is not firm, evident- ly, and you know you ought to take care of yourself." "O, why do I?" she answered, pettishy; "only be- cause my Lord Fitzroy wills it. I would rather a hun- dred times have taken Felice; because, do you know, I 've felt so sorry for Maria since she died. After all, was it Maria's fault that she was what she was, or mine that I am what I am? I fancy education and society had   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      123 something to do with the matter. I suppose Maria would never have been so imperious if mother had not yielded to her in everything, and she had not been so much flattered. But Felice is a thousand million times better off with you than she would be with us; that's one good thing. Do you really care for her, Delia?" "Why, Clara, I love the child dearly. How could I help it, she is so grateful and affectionate, and so deso- late, but for us?  "Does she have those horrid temper fits now? I never could stand those. I should let her do just as she liked, for fear of them." "And thereby run the risk of her never improving. She does have them occasionally; such a temper cannot be overcome at once, but she tries to check it, and she has partially succeeded." "Well, I'm glad there 1s some good people in the world. Excuse me a moment, Delia, I must take my drops." "What do you take, Clara?" O, a slight stimulant, I'm so run down. Do you know," hurriedly, as if to change the subject, " that I heard from Julia the other day, and she 's so happy; odd, is n't it?" "Scarcely to me," said Delia, smiling, "that she should be happy in a comfortable home, married to the man of her choice, and one every way so deserving." "O, I might have known you wouldn't be astonished. It's a shocking pity you had n't been poor, Delia, you would have been just as happy as you are now. Why don't you found a hospital and retire into poor life?" "I am too selfish, Clara, for that. I have various ways for enjoying the means God has given us." "Yes, yes, I know in helping the poor and doing all   124      HERE AND HEREAFTER: the good you can. Well, Delia, just transfer a little of your righteousness to me, won't you, you 'll never need it all."  "' So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all these things which are commanded you, say we are unprofit- able servants': we have done that which was our duty to do," replied Delia, gravely, for she did not quite like her cousin's half jesting manner. After she had left, Mrs. Fitzroy's strange manner, when she asked her about the drops, recurred to her. What could it mean? why did she not tell her what she was taking? It was the first evasion Clara had used to- wards her for years. Was the cloud already rising upon her path? Alas! although she feared for her, little knew she that this cloud, now no bigger than a man's hand, would grow and grow, till it should overshadow her whole life.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        125 CHAPTER XII. "For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind." For some months James Clarke kept his word to Mr. Norton; he attended to his business, and held himself aloof from his former evil associates. But gradually the restraints which he had imposed upon himself be- came irksome, for as yet his house was founded only on the sand. And " little by little " he fell back into his former vicious courses. No one leaps at once into the very depths of the black gulf of sin, any more than any one is at once born again fully into a life of virtue and holiness. No; the way down to that gulf is often strown with flowers, and sometimes so illusive is it as to make the worse appear the better road ; and then the descent is so gradual, and the eyes and the heart become at each successive step so accustomed to the changes which occur, that one is not quite aware of his perilous position until its very brink is reached, and his feet -are sliding, sliding fast down into its dark abyss. So it was with James Clarke. A little out of humor one evening in the autumn at some sharp rebuke from Mr. Carter, he encountered one of his old compan- ions, who invited him to join a number of their fel- lows at an oyster supper. At first he declined; but when the other mockingly said, "O, I forgot, we are tied to St. Norton's apron strings," and added some "*   126      HERE AND HEREAFTER: other provoking taunts, with an oath, such as had not polluted his lips since the night Mr. Norton had be- friended him, he said he was not afraid of saint or devil, and would go with them just to prove that he was not. He did not return from that supper without being the worse for the wine he drank, and without having won a small sum of money. After that he went with them, at first occasionally, and then oftener and oftener, until at last he found himself deeply involved in debt, and his evil companions. dunning him for their money, and threatening him with exposure in case he did not pay them. Meantime affairs at home were daily growing worse and worse. But that while he was steady he used to bring home food for himself and sister, they must have suffered. His father seemed uneasy and anxious too, and went about fastening with his trembling fingers every blind and door in the old house. One day Annie heard him muttering to himself, apparently in great ter- ror: "That Dickson says he 'll have the money if he murders me. O dear, O dear'! I have n't any money; I 'm poor, poor, poor!" At last the crisis came to James and his father both. The former returned home late one night from a gam- bling carouse, where he had played himself deeper and deeper into debt and despair. He had arrived at that point when he was reckless, maddened with wine and fierce with rage against his companions and his father. As he turned into the lane which led to his home, he swore a dreadful oath that he would have the old man's money, by fair means or foul. 'c I will, I will," he mut- tered to himself, " by -!" and again the oath escaped from his lips; but this time it was uttered with the sup- pressed fury of a demon.   ORE THE TWO ALTARS.       127 The house door was locked; that he expected. But then Annie always came down to open it for him; this night she did not. He threw a pebble up at her win- dow, but there was no response. It was bitter cold, and the stars and the young moon shone out upon the peace- ful scene around,--peaceful in all save the hell that was raging in that young man's breast. As he looked up again at his sister's window, he noticed that her little half-curtain, always drawn at that hour, was open. She could not be at home, he thought, knowing that she sometimes remained over night at Mrs. Norton's, though rarely. No matter, he would then get in at tile window; these old frames would give way at once un- der his powerful young arm. So had he often thought when he had seen his father so carefully securing the fastenings; But which window should he try? As he went round the house to decide, he came to that of his father's room. Good heavens! it was opened. No, not opened; it had been taken out, and as he came near to it pieces of glass broke beneath his feet. He paused a moment. He remembered his fearful oath. He looked. in; it was dark, and the moon did not afford sufficient light to en- able him to see the bed. But what was he afraid of? Probably some robber had been- there and effected his escape while his father still slept. Acting upon this thought too soon to reflect that his father never slept soundly, he leaped in, and going to the match-box lighted a lamp which always stood by a little table be- side the bed. Yes, there was his father, asleep; one arm thrown over his head; his face hidden from view. Now was his time to see if the box was there under his pillow, where he supposed it was kept. Cautiously he put out his hand to feel for it, but his hand trembled, and came in contact witlh that of his father.   128      HERE AND HEREAFTER: With a cry which might almost have awakened the dead, the young man sprang back. The hand he touched was icy cold; his father did indeed sleep, but it was that sleep which knows no awakening. Although wild with terror and remorse, he went to the body so as to look at the face, to see if there were any marks of violence upon it. It was convulsed with terror, but- bore no other expression. There was no hope, no joy, no peace, no look whatever such as we like to behold upon the countenances of the departed, not even one of blank uncertainty, but only of hopeless, absolute terror. "O my God!" groaned James, " his blood is on my head. I swore I would have the money at any cost, and I would have murdered him! I fear I was a murderer in my heart, - I know I was." And tormented by the fierce agony of remorse, he rushed out of the room and fled, -fled he knew not whither; he cared not, if only he could get away from that place. When miles were between him and his home, he stopped on the broad road to consider what was to be done. Where should he go? He had re- gained sufficient coolness of mind to reflect, that by leaving the house as he had done he had cast suspicion on himself, if he had been seen; and the probability was that he would be pursued and apprehended as his father's murderer. How many times in his anger against him had he wished him dead. Yes, over and over again had he done so; and although he had not conceived the purpose of murdering him that night, yet he had determined to have the money, cost what it might. He had but one desire now; that was to see Mr. Nor- ton, tell the whole truth, and beg him to send him out of the country for ever.   OR, THE TWO ALT  .      129 James Clarke had naturally a kind heart and a gener- ous disposition; and there was a poor but respectable woman residing hi Boston whom on one occasion he had rescued out of the clutches of some of his vile com- panions and conducted home, and subsequently be- friended in a time of great distress. She was now a widow and took in washing. She lived in the attic of a crazy old building in  Street. To her he would go and beg her assistance. He was so fortunate as to reach her home just as she was coming down stairs, pail in hand, to go out. "My good woman," James accosted her, "let me see you for five minutes." "Bless me, Mr. Clarke, is that you? Well, I never. Come up, if so be as you can, these old crazy stairs. Well, I declare, how mortal pale you be," as the gray light from her window fell on his face. "I have reason to be pale, Mrs. Jones. Can I trust you? I have been a friend to you." "Trust me to the death, Mr. Clarke. O, have n't you been my friend? Did n't you save me fr6m worse than death,-worse a thousand times? I'll save you, if I die for it! my life belongs to you, sir." "Thank you, Mrs. Jones." And in as few words as possible he told all his story; and that he wanted a hiding-place, and through her to see Mr. Norton. "Bless my soul, Mr. Clarke, if this is n't an awful scrape," said the kind-hearted woman. "I'll go any- where for you. As for hiding, this is the likeliest place you ever seed, just up that loft. You can git up on the chairs, and then climb up; then I 'll take 'em away, and you're as safe as can be,--and I'll give you my clothes-line, case you 'd like to get out of the trap afore I come back. There, now all's right."   130      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "Now, Mrs. Jones, I want you to go to Mr. Norton's store; you must ask to see him, and you must see him. I dare not write; tell him I am innocent, but appear- ances are against me,-tell him for Christ's sake to come to me?" "Maybe if the young gentleman had thought a little sooner for Christ's sake, he 'd never got into this," said compassionate Mrs. Jones to herself; " but he was real good to me, and I 'll never desert him now." Fortunately Annie Clarke was spared the dreadful spectacle of her father's corpse instead of his living self, -for the milkman, going to the back door to leave his scanty daily supply, discovered the open window and broken glass, and looking in saw that face of horror, which had nearly driven James mad. He drove directly to Mr. Norton's. The proper attentions were paid to tlhe body, and although there were no evidences of a violent death, it was pretty certain a robbery had been committed, if murder had not been attempted; and there was no lack of surmises with regard to the culprit. Of course, James's singular non-appearance was commented upon; but it was not until Mr. Norton, upon going early into the city, found he had not been at the store that morning, that the most painful suspicions were ex- cited in his mind, especially as he remembered how fre- quently of late the young man had seemed moody and inattentive to his business. ' When Mrs. Jones made known to him her errand, he set out immediatety to ac- company her back. With a quick perception of what was best calculated to insure secrecy, Mrs. Jones left Mr. Norton a short distance from her home, after giving him the necessary direction, and then took a nearer way, so that when he arrived at the attic door she was ready to receive him.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       131 "Gentlemen comes here for me many times to do work for their ladies," she said, "but I thought my neighbors would think it queer like to see one a coming home with me. Please to be seated, and I'll put up the chairs for Mr. Clarke, and go and watch outside." She did accordingly, and James came down from his hiding-place like a guilty culprit as he felt himself to be. Mr. Norton was prepared to meet him with a good deal of severity. Whether guilty of his father's death or not, he was guilty of something very wrong, or he would not be concealing himself where he was. But one look at the pale, haggard, remorseful face of the young man at once softened the kind heart of his nolble master, and his' first words were: "Sit down, James; I pity you, from my heart I do." "You have need, - O, you have need, sir; and but that you are so good and generous, I should never have dared to meet you; but I know you can pity a misera- ble sinner, while you must condemn him." "Is it true then, James,-- can it be true, that you are your father's--"  ' Murderer? you would ask," almost shrieked James. "No, thank God, not in act, only in thought. Indeed, Mr. Norton, I don't think he was murdered at all. I believe he died of fright; and that not caused by me either; I believe so, because of late he has suffered so much from  fear of some enemy unknown to me, and because he was so weak and shattered and miserable in mind and body.   But I am guilty; you don't know how guilty; so guilty, I think God has no pardon for such a sinner." Then, with a voice choked with remorse and the ter- rible reproaches of conscience, James Clarke told Mr. Norton all that had occurred since the autumn, when he   132      HERE AND HEREAFTER: had first gone astray again; of the hold his early com- panions had upon him; of his purpose the preceding night, of his oath, and then of all that followed. He did not attempt to exculpate himself in the least, either for his return to evil companions and habits, or for his wicked designs upon his father. "I did n't know how wicked I was, Mr. Norton," he continued, " until I saw my father's corpse before me; and then I felt that I was a murderer at heart. And was I not? Am I not as guilty as if my own hand had struck down the old man?" "No, James, you did not commit the deed, and, as I understand you, you had formed no such purpose ; and I believe God would have saved -you from such an aw- ful crime. But at the same time you have been very guilty, -guilty of cherishing hatred towards your father, which is a deadly sin in the sight of Heaven, --guilty also of periling your own soul's salvation by voluntarily returning to the haunts of iniquity. You deserve to suf- fer, and suffer you must; no one can, no one would wish to prevent that. You sent for me," continued Mr. Norton, with increased severity of manner; " how did you suppose I could aid you? You have broken your promise to me once, and that, too, under circum- stances of great aggravation ; can I trust you again?" "No, sir," answered James, now completely humbled, "I cannot expect that you should; for I don't feel that I can trust myself; but as the only friend that can save me from utter ruin, I ask your aid once more. O Mr. Norton, don't cast me off now! Though I dare not again promise to do only what is right, I will strive, sir, O, I will, Mr. Norton, - and I will pray to God to give me strength!" Mr. Norton made no answer for some minutes, when he asked, "What is your wish, James?"   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       133 "To be sent away, sir, where I may either retrieve my character or die in the attempt; for once away, never will I return home until I can do so creditably to my friends. You will help me, sir. I know you will." "Listen to me, James; I will help you this once, that is, I think I can obtain for you the situation of supercargo on board a ship which sails for Calcutta in a few days; the young man who was to have the place being now dangerously ill; and then I will repay your vile asso- ciates. In doing this, James, I am placing great confi- dence in you, as well as exposing myself to censorious remarks, and I expect you will acquit yourself like a man of honor, and repay -to me the sum I lend you, principal and interest, as soon as you are able." "I will, sir, O I will; only trust me as far as you call trust one so unworthy." "I believe you' have a good heart, James; and if the lesson you have now received be not a salutary one, you must be depraved indeed. Because Christ, who is my example and guide, came into the world to save sinners, and because his religion counsels me to be merciful as I hope for mercy, io I extend to you a helping hand. Now let me tell you what I expect of ybu, that you will at once abandon all hope or expectation of keeping your promise to me, or of thoroughly reforming your char- acter, without looking away from and above yourself for strength to do it. You are not sufficient unto your- self, young man. The help you need now, most of all, is Jesus Christ, the Sayviour of men. He only can save you, and to him you must at once turn in penitence and in faith. Your life hitherto has been far from a relig- ious one, even in those external observances which I never see neglected by a young man without entertain- ing great fears for him. There must be an entire 12   134    .  HERE AND HEREAFTER: change henceforth, in all these respects, or your refor- mation is a mere rope of sand. Hereafter read your Bible and heed its lessons. But with reference to your going to Calcutta. When you arrive there, I think a young friend of mine, who is a clerk in a large mercan- tile house, will be glad to exchange situations with you for a period, that he may return home on a visit. The exchange I think I shall be able to effect if the captain of the ship gives a. good account of you; otherwise, I shall leave you to your fate. But yod] must remem- ber, if you disgrace yourself, you will disgrace me, like- wise." "I will never do it, sir; I will attend to what you have said to me, and I will strive to become a Christian; for I see how kind and lenient you are towards me, so unworthy to be one." "If you are only that, James, you have nothing to fear. Then you will never lack friends; for you will have one for your Friend who is mighty to save." "But my sister?" "Yes, James, your sister. Don't you wish to see her?" "No, sir, no," was the vehement reply; "never till I can meet her pure eye without shrinking; never till by repentance and a worthy life, I can wipe out the dis- grace I have brought upon her. O, sir, you don't know Annie; you don't know how patiently she has borne, in all those dreary years since our mother died, hardship, privation, and sorrow; how disinterested and kind she has been to me; how filial and respectful to my father. She is a child, you think; but she is a woman and a saint in heart and soul; and this gentle being loves me so dearly, - whose pride I have always been,--whose protection I should have been. How   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       135 have I wronged her! Instead of being her protector and comforter, I am her disgrace and sorrow. No, sir, I don't wish to see her; I cannot. But where will be her home?" "That is already provided for. Miss Ellis came to our house this morning as soon as the dreadful tidings reached her, and she said Annie's home must hence- forth be at Elm Hill. She claims a distant relationship, you are aware." "Yes, sir. Thank God! Annie will be happy there." "But, James, you must see your sister; that is, you must leave this place and return at once to N  otherwise suspicion will infallibly fall upon you; and you must interest yourself in whatever is taking place with reference to the death of your father, and be pres- ent at his funeral. As I believe your statement, if this course brings you into difficulty, I will stand by you to the last." O, I cannot, I cannot; I feel so guilty at heart I shall certainly betray myself." "If you are so weak as to do so," replied Mr. Norton, with some severity, " when you know the consequences both to your sister and yourself, there is little use in my undertaking to assist you. Be a man, remember Annie, and, as I said before, I will do my best for you. If I am inquired of where you were last night, I shall advert to your late evil associates." Circumstances favored James. The verdict of the coroner's inquest upon the dead body of his father - as there were no marks of violence on his person -was, that he died a natural death in his bed, probably of dis- ease of the heart, and from appearances suffering at the time from fright. An old woman, who lived in the outskirts of the village, testified that a mysterious lodg-   136      HERE AND HEREAPTERM er of hers, calling his name Smith, but who left in his room a handkerchief marked J. Dickson, suddenly disappeared the night previous; this, added to the state- ment of Annie, with regard to words uttered by her father, fixed suspicion on him as the robber of the old man. It was afterwards ascertained that a person, an- swering to the description of the mysterious lodger, took passage in a vessel bound to a port in South America. After James Clarke had left his native country, the tide of suspicion turned upon him. Reports got abroad with regard to his late habits, - and the almost desper- ate state of mind in which he left his associates on the night of his father's death. Mr. Carter was overheard to say to Mr. Norton, in one of his severest tones, "I find, sir, young Clarke had become much involved again by gambling. Either some mistaken friend has supplied him with funds, or he knew more about his father's money than was supposed." And remarks like the following were frequently heard: -4 Who did pay the young man's debts?" ' Why did he leave the country?"  "Why should Mr. Norton shield the guilty?" "He did n't look so pale the day of the funeral all for grief at his father;s death!" "( Some folks are over humane ;-- shield the guilty and let the innocent suffer." "Everybody knew that An- nie Clarke was a great deal at Rosedale. Without doubt Mr. Norton had good reasons for getting James Off.", So much was said, that not only a very strong feeling was excited against James, but against Mr. Norton also. The latter took the matter very coolly. He told his wife that it was best to let such things alone and they would pass away of themselves. He made no other de- fence of his conduct, than to say one day, with more than   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       187 usual sternness in his manner, to Mr. Carter, in the presence of the clerks: "You say appearances are against James Clarke. They always are against the un- fortunate. Whlly did I get him the situation abroad so suddenly, when you counselled me differently, and re- luctantly consented to it? For the very good reason, that a sudden opportunity offered itself; and because the young man felt, that to go abroad was his best security against a return to his former vices. Why did I not think of it the day previous to the old man's death? Because, in the first place, I was not then aware that the young man wished to go; and, in the second place, if I had been, I did not know of the opportunity. Is it so strange that the shock, his own remorse in consequence of his sins, and the notoriety of such a life and death as his father's, should have given him such a wish? I think not. I am able and willing to bear all the censure that is dealt out to me for my share in the transaction. Mr. Carter and young men, James is innocent of the  charge of robbing his father." And so as this young man had sown he reaped. Sus- picion had fastened upon him with her cruel blight,- and that solely in consequence of his evil deeds. ,So surely does retribution follow the wrong-doer even here, and so surely also must the innocent suffer with and for the guilty. 12*   138      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER    XIII. "I 11 strive To kill this monster jealousy." - MASSINGER. A NEW light seemed to have dawned in the old brown house of Elm Hill after Annie Clarke went there to re- side. Miss Ellis, from her habitually cheerful demeanor, became almost youthful again in the exuberance and elasticity of her spirits, saying sometimes: "Now we shall pay off the mortgage, and come out bright; now that we have youth and hope to aid us. Why, these old walls smile upon you, child ; the faded sofas and carpets are renewing their youth; actually the roses and leaves are becoming red and green, as they were in my young days." While Mr. illis seemed each day to be returning to his early life, rather than journeying on towards the seer and yellow leaf. As for Annie herself, she almost began to think her long past youthful visions were about to be realized; all but for James's absence; and believing, as she did, that he was now on the right course to usefulness and honor, her hopeful young spirit could well brook that little delay to perfect happiness. Mrs. Norton, in her kind treatment and attention, had opened a new life to the young girl; but while she had lived at home, shad- ows would fall heavily upon her, despite the happy hours passed with her friend. But now the old-fashioned, somewhat dilapidated house of Elm Hill seemed like   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       139 a paradise, so delightful was the atmosphere of love and kindness she breathed constantly. No one, to see Miss Ellis ordinarily, would ever have dreamed of the tender affections in her heart waiting only an object to expend themselves upon. Annie was child and sister to her at once. One thing she was determined upon; if she could prevent it, no blight, such as had fallen upon her youth, should ever touch this beautiful flower. She would guard and watch her, O so jealously! and no one should aspire to her Annie, who was not every way worthy. In the occasional social gatherings at Rosedale, where Annie and Howard Leslie sometimes met, she sounded that young man's depth with an earnestness and thor- oughness which amused Howard and surprised Mrs. Norton. At length, one evening after a long conversa- tion with him of a more serious nature than usual, she said, emphatically, "You 'll do, young man, you 'll do." "Do for what, Miss Ellis?" "For safe anchorage; in other words, your friends can trust you." "Thank you, madam; if that is really your opinion at last, have the kindness to leave your line and plum- met at home in future, and let us meet on more equal terms. You've sounded me so long that I began to fancy I was but a shallow stream, after all." "No, plenty of deep water, I'm convinced. You've borne the ordeal well, and now you may come to me next Thursday. I don't like young men in general, but you 'll do." It must not be supposed that high-minded Miss Ellis was forming a matrimonial scheme. She had no such idea; she only saw that Howard sought Annie's society, and she appeared at ease with him. Miss Ellis was   "O       HERE AND HEREAFTER: resolved no young men should ever visit her home of whose character she did not approve. Howard saw that she was at fault respecting him, and, with a mis- chievousness which was a part of his fun-loving nature, did his best to mystify her, and succeeded in part. 'Melville Temple remarked one day to Howard, that it was astonishing how many pretexts he made, in the course of the winter and early spring, for visiting Rose- dale and Elm Hill. Howard said, demurely, he was studying botany with Miss Ellis, preparatory to summer explorations,--that some walks of- his, in the autumn, had inspired him with a desire to know more of certain species of plants. At which, Melville, who had heard of the adventure at Willow Pond, quietly recommended another cold bath as a cure to such studies, unworthhy a man of iron, day-books, and ledgers. In reply, Howard said: "' Sir, these cold ways, That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous, Where the disease is violent.' Your remedy, once tried involuntarily, increased my difficulty. Besides, I find iron and accounts hard of digestion, and am seeking some palliative more soothing than your cold bath, which I hope to discover in my re- searches into the vegetable world." The only event of startling interest either to Rosedale or the inhabitants of N. , that occurred during the winter, was the sudden death of Mr. Clarke, and the ten days' wonder and gossip about James and his affairs, mingled-with some exclamations of surprise that Miss Ellis should have taken his sister to reside with her, - and some pity for the poor young thing, doomed to live with two such queer people as those at Elm Hill. But this passed off, and, as we have seen, Annie was living   OR, TEE TWO ALTARS.       141 happily with her new-found relatives. The family at Rosedale were pursuing the even tenor of their way, with little to disturb the harmony of their life, except occasional eruptions from the little volcano Felice, as Howard had styled her. Even these were becoming less frequent and violent. As 'Delia looked upon her now bright, animated face, and read there promise of a future rich harvest to the seed now sown, she thanked God in her heart that she had overcome her selfish ob- jections to giving the orphan a home. With June, came changes in N--    and Rosedale. Families residing in the city in winter, returned to their rural homes, and the streets and lanes were again made pleasant with the sights and sounds of sum- mer, and of happy young faces and voices. When the roses bloomed again, Adie Lawton and Melville Temple were married, and went to R   to reside; and about the same time an immortal flower also budded into life at Rosedale, to gladden the hearts of its grateful, happy parents. The child was a boy, and received the name of George Arlington, and, as the young mother clasped her treasure to her breast, she breathed a silent prayer, that the virtues and graces of her father might descend upon his grandson. Who shall describe all the sacred joy and holy thoughts, occasioned by the advent of that frail life into its earthly home? What hopes were en- tertained, what wishes formed, what prayers uttered, what earnest resolves made, and what fears expressed, can best be appreciated by those who, for the first time, have had intrusted to their charge a helpless in- fant; and who, in their joy that a child has been given to them, do not forget the great responsibility which rests upon them, as guides and protectors. They were thoughtful, Christian parents, to whom this infant had   "2      HERE AND HEREAFTER: been given; and yet, as Leshe said, remembering that of such is the kingdom of heaven, who is sufficient for these things!" Let the curtain fall over these parents in the fulness of their content. For when, added to the natural emo- tions of pride and happiness at such an event, is the deep -joy and hope of Christian believers, the scene is too sacred for spectators. It was an occasion also of unmixed gratification to all the household at Rosedale, with one exception, and that was Felice. When told by Madam Norton, that Mamma Delia had a dear little son, she stood for a mo- ment transfixed to the spot with astonishment; then her pale cheeks crimsoned, and her dark eye flashed, her limbs trembled, and she seemed a perfect fury, con- vulsed with rage. Madam Norton looked with aston- ishment at such an unforeseen result to her communica- tion. "Are you not pleased, Felice? I thought you would be very happy." "Heureux,--  Felice heureux; non, non, non,- Fe- lice miserable. O mon pdre, mon pore! why did you leave votre petite fille? Oh! oh! Felice never will have that baby for a brother. No one loves Felice note." "My child," said Mr. Norton, who was passing at that moment and heard the mournful emphasis to 1" now, "why should you think so? We all love you more than ever; there is room in all our hearts for baby and you too. I want you to be baby's elder sister. Come, Mamma Delia said just now, how pleased dear Felice will be, and asked me to bring you to her." As lhe spoke, he held out his hand. She looked at him wistfully for a moment, as if debating in her mind whether to go through the ordeal which he proposed or   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       143 not. He answered her glance with one so kind and tender, that she put her hand in his and went with him to his wife's chamber. The -room was darkened, so that Mrs. Norton did not at once perceive the marks of agitation in her face and manner; but as the child took the outstretched hand and kissed her, she noticed that hers was cold, and her face burning hot,-infal- lible symptoms of a " temper-fit," as Mrs. Fitzroy called it. "Why, Felice," she said in a pained tone, " what is the matter?" The child made no reply, but hid her face upon the pillow. "Don't you wish to see the dear baby, who shall be your little brother, if you wish? The nurse will show him to you." Felice gave one look at the little unconscious inno- cent, and then, with the speed of a fawn, darted out of the room, down the stairs, through the hall, out into the garden, and on till she reached a favorite retreat in a little grove of pines, at some distance from the house. Throwing herself upon a rustic seat, and cov- ering her face with her hands, she gave way to min- gled grief and anger in passionate sobs and disjointed exclamations. At last, worn out with the violence of her emotions, she fell asleep. She had not however been, as she supposed, alone. Mr. Howard had seen her rapid flight from the house, and had  followed at a distance, and watched her- while she gave way to grief, and remained by her while she slept. When she awoke, she met his sad, serious, yet kind look, and at once starting to her feet, approached him, and said L humbly: "I have been very naughty, good Uncle Howard; please forgive me."   "4      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "It is not I who am to forgive you, Felice, but God, whom most of "all you sinll against by giving way to your bad feelings. And then, too, you have been very un- kind to those good friends who have done so much for you. They are very happy that God has sent them a dear little child to love and take care of, and they are disappointed that you, too, are not happy. They thought you would love a little helpless creature,-far more help- less than your little pigeons and rabbits you so delight to take care of; and they thoughlt, too, you would be pleased to have some one else to love and to love you. We are all very sorry that you feel as you do. Did you look at your little cousin,--for he is that, if you do not wish to call him brother, - and see how innocent and pretty he looked?--at his tiny feet and hands; and would not you, Felice, like to guide those little feet, when baby is old enough to totter along, and take hold of those little hands and help him about?" "Yes, Felice would like that; but I do want Mamma Delie to love me always." "So she will, my child; but you must not expect her to love you alone, and of course we must expect, both you and I, that she cannot give us so much time as she used; for God sends little children to their parents, so weak and helpless, in order that they may devote them- selves to them for a time at least. It will make us all happier and better to have this little child in the house, if we wish it should." "Happier, if we love him, Uncle Howard; but how better? Felice does not see." "Because, my dear, we must be kind and tender and forbearing  to a little creature so helpless; that will make us better, will it not?" "If we are; but, Uncle Howard, my mother was never   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       145 very kind to me; perhaps that was why she was not happy, or --" She did not add the word good, that was in her mind, but broke off abruptly, and then resumed:  I will go home and say I am sorry, and, Uncle How- ard, I will try to love my little cousin." I hope lyou will, my dear little Felice; and while Mamma Delia is busy with him, we will take care of each other, will we -not?" "I should like that. Felice love you always." So passed off this little breeze, which came to disturb the calm waters of their serenity at Rosedale. Felice acknowledged her fault, as she was always ready to do, when she was penitent, and strove to overcome her in- voluntary dislike to her baby cousin; but it was evident tlhe feeling remained in a degree, although Mr. Howard had so much confidence in the real goodness of her heart, that he felt little doubt as to the ultimate result; and by no means agreed with Mrs. Musgrave, that it would be a constant source of unhappiness to Mrs. Nor- ton if the child remained with her. "' You may be very sure, Mr. Howard," said that lady, in her most superior manner, " that it is never produc- tive of happiness in families to attempt to iningle such discordant elements. When we were married, I said to Mr. Musgrave, ' My dear, you have ample means, and I am not poor; if we wish to assist any of our relatives, let us do it out of the house, and not in it.' Mr. Mus- grave agreed with me entirely, and we have lived, I Must say, a most happy, united life. Of course, Mr. Howard, I do not refer to such relatives as yourself and Mrs. Norton; I meant more especially taking children into the family, to be upon an equality with our own. My experience, which, for a woman of my years, has not been snall, has confirmed the wisdom of my judgment. 13   "6      HERE AND HEREAFTER: Don't you yourself, Mr. Howard, think there is great risk in such experiments, - great danger of heart-burn- ings, jealousies, &c., at least?" "I think, ma'am," replied Mr. Howard, " there are very few people who are calculated to carry out such experiments successfully. I hope Mr. Norton and my niece may be able to do so." "I hope they may, I am sure; but as Mr. Norton's family grows larger, I should have my fears lest he would find this little Felice a burden, and Mrs. Norton cannot be expected to love another person's child as her own." "Not precisely as her own, perhaps, Mrs. Musgrave; but I have no fears of the child's ever feeling the differ- ence." "I hope you may be right, sir; but I confess I should tremble at the result of such an experiment in our fam- ily. We are clannish, perhaps; indeed, I tell Mr. Mus- grave the blood of Clan Hawdon flows in my veins, and our children are so-fond of each other and of us, that I think they would hardly brook any interruption to our harmonious blending." She was right. Woe to the cnild whom circumstances should place under her roof; not that she would not be treated with a certain degree of kindness, - for in her way Mrs. Musgrave was a very kind-hearted, benevolent woman, - but that the contrast between such a depend- ent and her own children would be constantly forced upon her observation, and she would be made to feel wherein she differed from those paragons of society. Mrs. Musgrave was one of those women whose su- periority extends to their children, their houses, their cookery, and, in short, to everything which comes under their ownership and jurisdiction. Her children-were   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       147 obedient and well-mannered, - they were also healthy and good-looking; but they were self-conscious, alid fully shared in their mother's opinion, that alike their manners and morals, their health and looks, were owing to the fact of their being n6e Musgrave. Indeed, to hear them or their mother talk, one would almost sup- pose, that, in virtue of the peculiar privileges of their training, they were exempt from the ordinary ills of humanity. 'Thus far in life, experience (Mrs. Musgrave was great on experience) had favored that fallacious opinion; for death had never entered their door, - the children had never been alarmingly sick, and they had never known adversity; so they went on their way in self-righteous satisfaction. With such feelings, it is not to be wondered that Mrs. Musgrave's opinion in regard to Felice and her residence at Rosedale should have been what it was She judged from what it would have been in her family, and from that stand-point her judg- ment was correct.   "8      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XIV. And her against sweet Cheerfulnesse was placed, Whose eyes like twinkling stars in evening cleare, Were deckt with smyles, and all Sad Humors chased, And darted forth Delights, the which her goodly grac'd." - SPENSER. EARLY in July, the ladies connected with the different religious societies in N---, set on foot a project for a Fair, the object being to build a commodious hall for lectures and other uses. There were a good many pre- liminary meetings for the purpose of making arrange- ments, and, of course, some difference of opinion as to the best manner of carrying out their plans; but, on the whole, matters were conducted in an amicable spirit, un- til the question arose, where the hall should be placed, if sufficient money was obtained. Mrs. Musgrave strongly advocated one location; Mrs. Brown, an active, ener- getic, influential woman, as warmly favored another and entirely different site. "'Cause you see, 'cording to my notion, it's best to have a public building 'commodate the public. You go and set your hall upon that ere hill, I'd like to know how folks that goes afoot is going to get there stormy nights, and cold nights, and muddy nights? Taint no use to build a hall for nobody but carriage folks, and in a place that aint handy to the majority. That 's my 'pinion, - taint worth much, perhaps; but there 't is."' "I think it is worth a good deal, Mrs. Brown," said Mr. Larrabee, one of the clergymen of the place. "I   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      J1ILM think your reasons very cogent, and should be consid- ered, when the time arrives to select a site. At pres- ent--" "Excuse me, Mr. Larrabee," said Mrs. Musgrave; but don't you think we should consider somewhat what will be most improving to the town? Beech Hill is so elevated and commanding a position, that a fine building will be very ornamental, and really it will not be a bad walk at any time." "Hum," said Mrs. Brown, to a lady near, "I'd like to see her foot it up there, some of these ere slumpy nights. Guess French boots would be worse for wear." The discussion became an animated one, and the la- dies appeared to have forgotten the object of the meet- ing, when Mr. Howe said: "I propose, ladies, that the question of the location of the building be postponed until we have the means to erect it." "I 'm agreed," said Mrs. Brown, to her next neigh- bor. "I go for going ahead, when you once set about a thing; and we should n't have all this talk, if Miss Musgrave had n't always to put her finger in every pie. Guess the whole village won't be ruled by her;, she's never for putting her light under a bushel, any way; that's the reason she wants her city sot on a hill, I s'pose. She says she started this here project, but I know Miss Carter spoke on it long ago,-it was her notion." "No matter whose notion it was, Mrs. Brown," said Mr. Howe, " it was a good idea, and I hope it will be carried out peacefully and pleasantly. Now, do you know, that I think Beech Hill will be a good site for the building, and not open to the objections you urge?" "It 's a good sight for any building; nobody doubts 13*   150      HERE AND HEREAFTER: that, as I knows on; but we wants something besides sights, --them won't keep our feet dry or the cold off0.' Mr. Howe smiled at the misapplication of words, and in his own persuasive manner, tried to convince the good woman, that, besides the advantages Mrs. Musgrave had enumerated, neither mud nor snow-would annoy them as much there as on the flat she favored. Mr. Howe was her minister, and she was disposed to place confidence in his judgment, so she said, with a pleasant laugh: "La sake, I don't care notldin' about it, Mr. Howe; only Miss Musgrave kinder sets me against her, whenever she favors a notion. I don't know why,- speck it's human nater not to like to have the law laid down quite so stiff." This was really the case. Mrs. Musgrave's judgment in most matters was good, and her advice often the best that could have been followed; but if she advocated a point, there were sure to be many dissenting voices, and it was only when she was- seconded by Mr. Howe, and sometimes by Mrs. Howe also, that some persons were willing to listen to her at all, or accede to her proposi- tions. However, this little dissension passed off, and with a great deal of unanimity and good feeling preparations were made for the fair, and the day drew nigh which had been appointed. Nature, however, was not propi- tious. For nearly a week preceding the time, it rained and rained, - not in soft falling showers, but in heavy, copious, steady storms, short in duration, but quite in earnest while they lasted. This was a damper certainly, --or would have been in most cases; but the ladies  I were hopeful, and Mrs. Brown  said every day it rained I made it likelier to leave them a pleasant one.   I   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       151 " 'Sides it's no use to borry trouble. Time enough to fret when the day comes, if it rains then. Mister Par- sons, he says we are going to have a first-rate day, no mistake. He 'll never say die, you know, if he gets hold of a thing." "What does Mr. Parsons say now?" asked one of the unhopefuls, as the day previous to the appointed one commenced, came to its meridian and close,--dark, sullen, and showery. "Say?" said Mrs. Brown; " he says it'll be all right afore ten o'clock to-morrow morning. We 'lll have to work a little harder fixin' up, that's all." Mr. Parsons was right, to the great joy of all the be- lievers, and the disappointment perhaps of the croakers, to be found everywhere, who did n't see after all how tents were to be raised, tables spread and adorned, and the grounds cleared in season for the occasion. Willing hearts and strong arms, however, can accomplish a great deal, and before eleven o'clock, Pine Grove, on the banks of the Charles, was arrayed in its gala dress. The men and; matrons, who had been so busy at work all the morning, took breath and their places, while the young, who had been equally active, returned in troops from their homes, where they had gone to arrange their toilets, as fresh and fair as if the morning had been a holiday. And so the pleasures of the day began at last. Nature had provided against damp feet with her carpet of last year's fallen pine-leaves, which yielded to the tread- as soft and dry as Wilton or Tapestry in a drawing-room. The band discoursed sweet music; fate-ladies and grab-bags invited the curious; fruits, cakes, meats, and ices tempted the hungry and thirsty; swings swayed back and forth with their joyous burdens; children frolicked, played, and laughed or danced around a July pole, raised   152      HERE AND HEREAITER : in the centre of a platform in one part of the grove; or at the river-side skipped stones, floated leaves, or watched the gambols of a fine Newfoundland dog, which jumped into the water and brought back sticks and branches to his master; ladies talked sense or nonsense, related the last marvellous speech of little Freddie, his narrow escape from convulsions, caused by partak- ing too freely of strawherries, &c., or of their latest trial in the line of domestic service, or of the last fashion, book, or review, or of still lighter or -deeper topics, ac- cording to their tastes and habits; gentlemen looked approving or superior on, or talked politics or stocks or cotton, according to their interests; young men and maidens, graceful, blooming, and happy, formed uncon- scious tableaux vivants under trees, or on rocks or mossy seats; poets, of whom we venture to aver at least two were present, took in the whole scene with their wonderful eyes, and daguerreotyped it upon their mind's tablet; clergymen smiled benignly and inter-' estedly upon their people and friends, rejoicing in all the kindly greetings and social interchange of the oc- casion, as so many indications of the peace and good- will on earth they strove to promote; while quiet ob- servers of life and human nature looked upon all, and hoped that God saw that it was good, even as in the early days of the creation of the world. In the afternoon it was rumored that a certain tent in a retired part of the grove was to be the scene of an Old Folks' Concert. It was observed thit all who is- sued from that tent looked as if they had received at least their money's worth, and as fast as one circle of auditors left, another took their place. The old folks were dressed as old folks did dress forty or fifty years ago; but it was remarked how clear their voices were,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        158 and how soft and fair their cheeks, shaded by full bor- dered caps, or the poke bonnet, and that through the old silver-mounted spectacles wondrous bright glances were shot for eyes of threescore and ten.  That the old folks who looked on and listened were gratified is hardly to be doubted from the pleased expression of their faces, some beating time, and others almost join- ing in the melody, as tunes familiar to their youthful days fell upon their ears. What memories they recalled, what visions of belles and beaux in their somewhat less expanded costume than is at present worn, what walks by moonlight, what huskings and quilting-bees, what stately minuets and dignified dinner-parties, what gal- lant compliments from army and navy officers, fresh and vivid as of yesterday, the present chronicler cannot pos- itively aver; but that it did recall some such past pleas- ures) and griefs too, was sufficiently evident. Dear '" old folks!" - a class fast passing away, since the rising generation so irreverently act, if not say, "Old folks," clear the track for Young America! But shall they pass away? Merged either in the fine lady, who at seventy sports her low necks, and her French flowered head-dress; or in the neglected grandmother, or old grandfather, who is more comfortable up stairs or in the dining-room, or anywhere out of the way, than in the family circle,--shall they pass away? Not while some true hearts survive, ever ready to honor age, experience, and sorrow. Still for them, as in those days our youth despise, shall be left the old arm-chair in the sunny corner; still for them shall be the love and honor and respect which is their due. Still for them the first and best places in the heart and at the board. Young America! you who sit in the easiest chairs, nor rise at the approach of your elders and superiors;   154       HERE AND HEREAFTER: you who smoke, and drink, and flirt, and declare your sage opinions when you should be in your nurseries, or silent listeners -at the feet of wisdom; you who say yes and no to white hairs,--call your father, governor; your mother, old woman; your grandparents, old things: you, Young America, never expect to be old yourself; or if you do, forget that with s" what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again." So merrily, cheerily, happily, passed that long sum- mer's day to all, - neighbors, townspeople, and friends. But some captious person, who has great belief that all Fairs are sponging places, - where Jewish extortion is practised by smiling, youthful faces, - asks, Was every- thing couleur de rose that day? Were there no heart- burnings, no envyings, no strife, no unkind comparisons, no slanderous remarks? Truth obliges the chronicler to assert, that, in an assemblage of men, women, and children, numbering from fifteen hundred to two thou- sand, there probably were some human feelings excited, some human propensities acted out. Mrs. Musgrave did express the opinion that, if Mrs. Charters had arranged her table and sold her articles according to her advice, the effect would have been better, and -the gain greater; and Miss Lina Musgrave did say that she never could eat any one's custards but mam- ma's, and she wondered who sent that horrid pastry. Mrs. Harris did turn up her pretty little nose even farther than nature had already done for her, and say, as she smoothed her disarranged flounces, "' Why, real- ly, this is quite a mixed affair!"Mrs. Brown said, to some selfish children who were stuffing their pockets slyly with cake, '"Get out, you mean things!" Mrs. Leonard Fitzroy did elevate her eyebrows, and say to Mrs. Norton, "La, Delia, this is the greatest scrape I   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       155 ever got into!"Mr. Carter did speak sternly to a young man who trod upon his corn, doubtless fancying him a clerk the while. Mrs. Grey, who always grumbled at everything, and who walks perpetually in an atmosphere as murky as her own name, did say, "Fairs were nui- sances, she was tired to death of them; she wished she was at home, she was sure the baby would get the measles." Mrs. Rigid did say, that the Americans were becoming too foreign in their love of pleasure, and that she thought those young girls better be at school than flirting with their beaux. These remarks are easily repeated. But who shall chronicle all the kind acts, pleasant words, friendly feel- ings, and happy smiles and looks arising from that day's enjoyment? No one, because their name was legion; while the discontents and fault-finders were few, and their grumblings were no more heeded than the with- ered leaves to be found on the grandest pride of the forest. Why, the kind act of Mr. Parsons, who to a poor washerwoman and .her three children gave the freedom of the tables at his own expense, and that of the lady who gave- a beautiful bouquet .of flowers to the same person, outweighed all the sneers, com- plaints, and fault-finding of the Harris, Grey, and Rigid tribe. And people were not sponged in this model Fair of N  ; they had all, and more than all, of their money's worth, without counting the enjoyment they had, and the good they received and did. Among the many strangers- present, who were mostly friends or relatives of the townspeople, were Howard and Duncan Leslie. Duncan's health had improved so muchl that he had been able to accomplish his cherished plan of going through college, although he had not en- tered upon any profession. The ministry, to which his   156      HERE AND HEREAFTER:           A tastes, no less- than the blameless purity of his life, ill- i dined him, offered too arduous a field of labor for his still uncertain health and strength. And, as he had no particular inclination for any other profession, his friends advised his accepting a situation in a public library that a was offered to him, which left him a good deal of leisure time that he could devote to literary pursuits. Suclh was now his present occupation. He retained in his manhood the same characteristics which had distin- guished him in youth; the same gentle, spiritual nature, the same poetic taste and temperament; the same se- rious, earnest, religious faith. Although very unlike his brother Howard, there was a strong bond of affec- ! tion and sympathy uniting them. Howard said there  was a fraternal matrimony between them,--that he .: supplied the fun and, nonsense to keep the machinery of iiS life in motion, and Duncan the oil to prevent friction; adding, he must be excused for a comparison suggested  by his business.  As Duncan stood somewhat apart from most of the company, looking upon the scene with the eye perhaps both of poet and observer, Mr. Howe came towards him and said: "You are enjoying this occasion, Mr. Leslie, as I best like to do, by looking on and watching the Varieties of life.'"' "And bf nature too, sir," replied Duncan.  'AAs you came up, I am afraid my thoughts were taking a selfish turn also." "How so?" asked Mr. Howe, with interest. "I was regretting my inability to go hence and de- scribe this scene, which now, in its strong contrast of quiet, gentle nature, in her silent groves, peaceful river, and blue sky, with the stir and joyousness of earnest, animated, human beings, impresses me so vividly.'   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        157 "Can you not carry the scene home with you, in your mind's eye, at least, Mr. Leslie? I think I could." "The scene, yes sir; but not the thoughts the scene inspires. It is my theory, Mr. Howe, that the world never, or seldom, gets the best thoughts of a writer." "Why so, Mr. Leslie?" "May I answer your question by asking another, sir?" "Certainly." "Will you tell me, sir, when your own ideas flow the most readily, when you feel almost an inspiration upon you; is it when you are seated at your desk, pen in hand, or in some such place as this, on the jnountain- top, by the ocean, listening to some inspiring melody; or, grander still, for there speaks the godlike in man, to some eloquent orator-?" "Why, of course, there is little inspiration in my pen and ink and study-table, and I have sometimes thought my sermons would be better if they could be composed when my heart was touched, and my soul enkindled by some such sights and sounds as you describe. Still, I have thought I could retain my best thoughts and give expression to them."- "Perhaps you can, sir; but I am unable to. Why, Mr. Howe, when I sit down to write, and try to recall the thoughts that crowded thick and fast upon my mind Under some inspiration of nature or art, they are, in comparison with what I felt at the time, flat, stale, and unprofitable; mere dregs of the wine-cup, all the life and sparkle exhaled; ashes upon the hearth, cold and dead; brown autumn leaves, without verdure or life. "Ah! believe me, sir," said the young enthusiast, " rare is the genius whose unspoken and unwritten thoughts are not his best, and this is one strong reason with nme "    158      HERE AND HEREAFTER: for faith in another and progressive state of being. God creates nothing; and bestows no gifts in vain, and these noble purposes and high thoughts, which sometimes stir our souls to their very depths, and convulse our inner life, as with a moral earthquake, are they to lie  dormant for ever, are they never to find honest utter- ance? As God is just and wise, I believe that they are." "There you are right, Mr. Leslie. God does not bestow any gifts in vain, and this is one reason why I  dislike to have persons mourning over false positions in  society. No position is a false one God ordains man to fill. Gifts apparently buried in a napkin, not by the  wilful neglect of the possessor, but by circumstances of life, are not lost; even in this world they yield a rich har- vest to the possessor, and in another, who shall dare say of what they may not be the seed? The grain of wheat, which for thousands of years has kept its germinant principle on the breast of a mummy, when at last its res- X urrection comes, is sown, and in due time brings forth a hundred-fold. Is not the human soul of more value?  With regard to the expression of your ideas, Mr. Les- g lie, I think, a few years hence, you will find your best thoughts, once clearly conceived, not easily lost, and that you will lose little either of their sparkle, life, or freshness by waiting to transfer them to paper." "I don't know, sir; such might be the case with some persons, but I think not with me; for I have from my earliest recollection been a writer or composer, that is, as I played in the fields, woods, or by the water, my imagination was busy at work, and I wrought out won- derful fictions and essays, even sometimes aspiring to woo the muse of poetry; but I could never transfer my best thoughts to paper, any more than a painter can   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       159 make his waters flow and sparkle, his leaves rustle and whisper, or his clouds float in heaven. Somewhat of their life must be lost by the process." "Thought is a subtle essence with you, it appears, Mr. Leslie; like the otto of rose, when you uncork the bottle, you lose some of the finest perfume." "Now look, I beseech you; see that knot of gentle- men there, another on the knoll, another by that large oak, and yourselves here, and tell me if this is gallant or social?" said Mrs. Melville Temple, approaching and addressing Mr. Howe and Duncan. "I 've been watch- ing you as stealthily as a cat. a mouse, for the last ten minutes, eager to pounce upon you, when I saw a fit- ting opportunity. Theology or metaphysics, which, or both, formed the subject of your discussion? But I can't stop to hear. Mr. Howe, your lay adviser, Miss Singleton, has a word of counsel for you. I read it in her advice-giving face; and I want you, Mr. Duncan Leslie, for my especial escort through this grove, in- tending to introduce you to Mrs. Carter, in whose eyes I read a spirit kindred to your own." So saying, our old friend, Adie Lawton, took posses- sion of Duncan, and carried him off in triumph, and before long had the satisfaction of seeing our young essayist and poet, in conversation with modest, retiring Mrs. Carter, a conversation which was carried on with interest on both sides apparently; for although Mrs. Carter did not converse volubly or dictatorially, what she said was to the point, and what she did not say with her lips was better than said by her expressive eyes and face. Meantime, another group of talkers were near by; and it so chanced that Mrs. Temple and Miss Ellis were within hearing. Mrs. Musgrave having managed   160      HERE AND HEREAFTER: to her heart's content, was now appearing in another phase of superiority. She was learnedly dioursing upon Art to some three or four gentlemen; one of whom, a young lawyer, Mr. Hill, listened to her with a most quizzical countenance, when she was speaking to any one else; but when she addressed him, his face assumed the appearance of marked deference. She had just finished an elaborate critique upon some paintings at the Atheneum, using all the technical phrases famil- iar to connoisseurs, when Mr. Hill said, in a most re- spectful tone and manner, but raising-his voice so as to be heard at some little distance: "Ladies and gentle- men, Mrs. Musgrave will deliver a lecture upon modern  authors, including Dickens, Thackeray, Mrs. Stowe, Carlyle, Emerson, Hugh Miller, President Edwards, Dr.  Channing, Hawthorne, Bryant, Tennyson, and Long-  fellow, in which she will consider these writers analyti-  cally, critically, and artistically; and will conclude with the recitation of an original poem entitled, 'Life con- sidered in its highest artistic relations to Custards, Car- lyle, and Cotton.'" "How can you be so severe, Mr. Hill,' said Mrs. Musgrave, evidently flattered, however, by the attention attracted towards herself by this announcement; "but we all know you." "Thank you, madam, if you admit that fact, I am sufficiently distinguished for the rest of my life; not to be known by Mrs. Musgrave argues one's self unknown indeed." "Does not Mrs. Musgrave see that, Mr. Hill is mak- ing fun of her?" asked Adie Temple of Miss Ellis. "( She is half suspicious of the fact, and half pleased to be supposed to have such extensive reading. As I live, she 's at it again, - hear her."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       161 Mrs. Musgrave: "Perhaps, considered strictly as ar- tistic works, that is, the consistent construction and elaboration of a plot, harmonious in its plan, com- plete in its arrangements, Dickens may be inferior to-" "Mother Goose," suggested Adie to Mr. Hill. "Mrs. Temple, I am surprised at your indecorous in- terruption of this touching and eloquent disquisition upon Dickens. Do you not understand, 'I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark! ' "Thank you for the comparison, Mr. Hill. I 'l1 pitch my bark a little lower, but bark I must." "If you die for it, I suppose; like the woman whose husband threatened to drown her if she persisted in say- ing scissors.. She was game to the last. That's being a true woman. Miss Ellis, allow me to escort you to the Old Folks' Concert; my brain reels from the pres- sure of ideas forced into it by that merciless strong- minded woman, who, because she can digest meat, never thinks of us poor babes." This was said in a tone so ludicrously weak and in- fantine, and with a face drawn between a cry and a pout, that the effect was irresistible, and a general shout of merriment ensued. Miss Ellis, in a tone almost as comical as his own, said, patting him on the shoulder as she did so, Don't cry, pet, and it shall go to the con- cert." So they walked off together. Mrs. Musgrave was soon left without any listeners, save a young college student, whom she had dazzled into the belief of her depth and originality. As Mr. Hill and Miss Ellis walked towards the con- cert tent, the latter begged an explanation of his im- promptu title of Mrs. Musgrave's poem, which he gave "*   162      HERE AND HEREAFTER:  in a low voice as follows: - Custards, emblematic of that superior woman's cookery; Carlyle, ditto of her transcendent learning; and cotton, the general term to signify her skill and taste in dress, &c." Perhaps Mr. Hill was a little too severe upon Mrs. Musgrave; but his shafts, apparent enough to others, fell- harmless upon her; for, as he once said, "For so fair a lady, she had the thickest skin he ever saw, more like the hide of a hippopotamus than anything else on land, sea, or in the sky"; not an inappropriate symbol, per- haps, of that entire self-sufficiency which envelops one as with an invulnerable garment. Beside, Mr. Hill was really so amusing, and his caricatures of one's weak- nesses so broad, that the subject of his wit was usually willing to bear the laugh for the sake of the fun, where they were not, as in Mrs. Musgrave's case, unconscious of the point of his jests. But in spite of thick skin, self-satisfaction, self-glo-  rification, pretentious claims in literature and the arts, no one had, really done so much, with perhaps the ex- ception of Mrs. Brown, to forward the interests of the Fair, as Mrs. Musgrave; and in the end it was found that her opinion as regarded the location of the hall was well grounded; and Beech Hill was ultimately crowned with a pretty Gothic structure called Beech Hall. Mr. Howe said gravely, in reply to some remark in Mrs. Musgrave's disfavor: "No one gave time and money more freely at the period of distress among our poor, consequent upon the failure of one of the facto- ries, than Mrs. Musgrave. Let us give her credit for the good she does, at least." It is perhaps no digression to remark here, that such a building as that erected on Beech Hill would be an ornament, as well as credit, to every country town large   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      163 enough to have lyceum lectures, concerts, &c. It com- prised not only a commodious hall for such purposes, but another, and smaller one, for different society uses, and rooms where ladies' meetings could be held if de- sirable.    CHAPTER XV. "I heard a voice from heaven Say, ' Blessed is the doom Of those whose trust is in the Lord, When sinking to the tomb!"- WILSON. As there is no face or form so fair and perfect, that some blemish may not be found in it; no flower so beautiful that some imperfection may not be discovered to mar its loveliness; no summer's day but has its pass- ing cloud; so in life an all-wise Providence has ordered that those seasons of fullest joy and deepest content shall have some shadows. So to Delia Norton, as the summer months came to the fulness of their glowing beauty, and as her heart realized more and more the exceeding peace and joy of a happy Christian union, and she drank day by day deeper draughts of happi- ness from the fountain of love opened by the birth of her child, a cloud rose upon her path, and cast some of its darkness upon her spirit; for it was now too evi- dent to her affectionate and grateful heart that her Uncle Howard was sinking rapidly. For a season, the fear had only been entertained at times, and speedily dismissed as an unwelcome guest; but now his condition was such as to admit of no doubt, and she felt that soon the only link which connected her with the home of her infancy would be sundered. Something of this was perhaps evident in her tearful eyes and sad coun- tenance, as one day, when Mr. Howard was unusually feeble, she sat by his couch, upon which he now spent   the greater portion of his time; for as he gazed upon her with that calm look of holy resignation his face so uniformly bore, and met her anxious glance, he shook his head, and taking her hand in his, said: "This must not be, my birdie. Why should you sorrow for a lonely old man, who longs to go home,-who longs for the peace and rest which heaven only can give?"   "You should never be lonely 'with us, dearest Uncle Edwalrd, and I -" "Not in one sense, I know, dear child, for you will do all in your power to make me happy. But to you the cares, trials, and joys of life are just opening; to me they are closing, fast closing; and though I should ever rejoice in your joy, and sorrow in your sorrow, yet is the body frail and feeble, and I long to cast it off and be clothed upon in the garments of righteousness. Do not in these my last days upon earth, by your grief, call me back to the world, which, God willing, I desire to quit. That I might live to see you, my birdie, set- tled in your own home, loving and beloved, safe under the protection of a strong arm and a true heart, safer yet in the care of that Friend who is above all friends, was my prayer long years ago, when I vowed to be to you, so far as I could, a father. That prayer is grant- ed, and now there is not one wish or desire which binds me to earth. I have lived to obtain the forgive- ness of the always beloved of my youth, for the wrong I did her; and I have also obtained forgiveness for the greater wrong I did against my own soul, and Him who created it, in those early days when I hardened my heart against Him. Why, then, O Lord," he con- tinued, raising his eyes to heaven, and speaking in a tone so earnest and solemn, with a look as rapt as if  166      HERE AND HEREAFTER: the Lord was indeed present to him, "should thy servant tarry longer? If it be thy will, take me home."              .   "Uncle Edward," said Delia, and now indeed her tears fell fast and free, but with a countenance no longer sad, " forgive me, if I selfishy wished to keep i you here, when you long to be at rest. And, uncle, say ':  that you forgive me all the trouble and sorrow I have ever caused you." "Forgive you, dear child? What have I to forgive to her who has been my one solace and comfort, and who, even in her most wayward days, was ever loving and obedient to me? You can never know what a balm to this poor wounded heart has been your love, so pure and guileless. You can never know, because you can never understand how sorely it stood in need of that healing which affection only could give. To others, - to the world at large, at least,- I may have seemed the cold, absorbed student; but never such to you, I trust."  "Never, uncle, never!" "When I am laid at rest, Delia, in yonder beautiful  cemetery, and sad thoughts arise in your heart, think of these two facts, - one, that I longed to go hence; the other, that from your infancy up you have been my greatest earthly comfort and happiness; and, thinking thus, let your sorrow be turned into joy." "I will, uncle. I will try, at least."  "And you will succeed; and in -the day of your greatest joy you will say, 'Uncle Edward would have  rejoiced with me on earth, but he is happier far in heav-  en'; and in the day of your heaviest sorrow you will say, 'Uncle Edward would have grieved to see me thus, and I rejoice that he has gone to the better land'; and    OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      167  soon, in the ordinary events of every-day life, which in- clude neither of these extremes, you will say, as you pursue your daily round of cares and duties and pleas- ures, ' Uncle Edward is happy, and so am I.' Now go, my child; and when Melville comes, tell him I wish to see him, for my days are now numbered." Melville Temple had, since Mr. Howard's recent rapid dedline, been almost a daily visitor at Rosedale; for he was attached to him, not only from gratitude for the influence which had procured him his present lucrative position, but by a strong feeling of attrac- tion and interest towards one so different from himself in character and temperament; for he, shrewd, practical, and energetic, was the very embodiment of the active business man; while Mr. Howard, with his delicate nervous organization, his poetic temperament, and his retiring habits, was of quite another order. What transpired at this interview was never known. Only it was observed that when the strong young man came forth from that sick-room his frame shook, and he was almost as a little child in his grief. From that period there was a change in him, so gradual, however, as to be imperceptible, except to those who, knowing him, and knowing Mr. Howard, could readily trace the probable connection between it and the interview. Wonderingly the little Felice looked at the dear friend she had learned to love so much, as he reclined on his couch, and, day by day, grew thinner and paler, and his countenance became more and more spiritual as he drew nearer to the heavenly mansion prepared for him. ,"O pourquoi Uncle Howard have the face de 'ange, Mamma Delie?" she asked, one day, with tears in her eyes.   168      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "What do you mean, my dear? Uncle Howard is good and happy, and he looks so."  - "Oui, oui, Felice knows that; but he looks like that holy angel in the picture in the library." "My dear child, Uncle Howard will go to God and the good angels soon, and we must try and be glad for m him." "How - what - pour mourir? Oh! oh! will God make to die every one who loves Felice? Next to mon cher p6re, Felice loves Uncle Howard; besides you, Mamma Delie." "U Uncle Howard wishes to go home to his Heavenly  Father, Felice; so we must not grieve him by our sor- row." The child made no reply, but the next time she was  alone with Mr. Howard, she sat looking into his face  with an expression so earnest, yet sad, that he drew her close to him, and said: "What is it, ma petite fille?" an expression of endearment he sometimes used to her. "O uncle, Uncle Howard!" was all she could say. "Do not grieve your young heart, my-dear, because the old tree is to be cut down, while the young ones spring up and flourish. Be good, my little Felice, and then we may all meet in heaven." "Felice try to be good, but sometimes Felice so naughty." "Will you do one thing for Uncle Howard when he  leaves you?" Oui, oui, anything Felice can." "Then, my dear, try to love your little cousin as you love Uncle Howard. Be an elder sister to him always; and if ever old bad feelings rise in your heart, think how dearly Uncle Howard loved you both, and how much he wished you to love one another."   Oit, THE TWO ALTARS.      169 "Felice will,-I will, I will!" she repeated, with energy. And the child never forgot that promise; but it was often and often a check upon her when the old passion- ate feelings rose up in her heart. After Mr. Howard's conversation with Delia, he ral- lied for a time, and was able to enjoy a good deal in the society of his friends, not only at Rosedale, but his sis- ter, Mrs. Leslie's family, who came often to see him. Indeed, the change in his condition seemed so favora- ble, that hope, even against the sober verdict of reason, whispered that he might yet regain a measure of health, and be spared to them who loved him so tenderly. But he cherished no such illusive idea; for although he sel- dom spoke directly of his death, he often alluded to it as an event soon to take place. The day previous to the closing one of summer, he asked Delia if she ex- pected her Aunt Leslie soon. "Early neit week, Uncle Howard, she said she would come; but I was to send for her if you wished to see her at any time." "Then send for her to-day, child, if you-please; I do wish to see her." Miss Leslie came early the following morning, and her brother received her as usual, and gave no expla- nation of her being sent for. Throughout the day he appeared as he had done lately, only a little more lan- guid. As it drew on towards night, he asked to have his couch wheeled to the window, where he could see the setting sun. This done, a change was observed to pass over his face, known to those who had before seen a soul in the final preparation for its eternal flight as the signet of death. One by one the assembled household came to his bed- 15   "U      iiiHER AND HffTjR:iAt"liK.; side, and received the parting pressure of the hand,. so soon to be cold in death. Only to Delia did he speak, and that in accents low and feeble, as she clasped her arms about him, murmuring, "Uncle, dear Uncle Ed- ward!" "God bless you, my birdie, - bless you!" Then he lay for a moment still and silent, while the cold dews of death stood upon his forehead, and faster and faster deepened the mysterious shadows of the grave upon his face. Another moment, and with a sudden  awakening to life and energy, he raised his eyes to heaven, and saying in a low, but distinct voice, "I know  that my Redeemer liveth," folded his hands upon his breast, closed his eyes, and slept the sleep of the just; while upon his countenance was not only the stamp of  death, but that other mysterious sign so often seen on the faces of the tried, sorrow-laden, and aged; an ex- pression of sweet and heavenly peace, as if God had  granted a glimpse of the joys he hath prepared for those who love him, to comfort and support them in their pas- sage through the dark valley. But of these things who knoweth aught? Who hath  returned to tell what God grants in that fearful hour when soul and body separate? None; and some would say such speculations are idle; but when we stand be- side the friend whose face in life had been marked with i care, sorrow, and agony, deep and broad, and see upon that face a look of youth and holiness' and peace, are we not comforted, as by a direct sign from God, that all is well with the departed? As the funeral procession, which bore the remains of Edward Howard to the pleasant spot where he had wished to be laid in his last sleep, passed out from Rosedale, its young master and mistress bowed rever-   OR, THE TWO ALIRS.        171 ently to the admonition, that in the midst of life we are in death; and when they returned to their home, it was with strengthened purposes and renewed resolves to consecrate their lives to the great hereafter, and to make their home a true altar of worship to the Most High. The grief in their hearts at this affliction, though severe, was not bitter, or without much comfort. Upon Delia the blow fell the most heavily; for to no one had her uncle's real nature ever been revealed as to her; to no one had his voice the peculiar, tender inflection, which it took when speaking to her, "his birdie," to the last; upon no one did his eye ever rest so lovingly as on her. "Truly," he one day said to her, " thou art my conso- lation." When her grief was heaviest at her heart, she remembered his words to her on that bright summer day, when they held sweet communion together, and was comforted. And so loved in life, and revered and mourned in death, passed on Edward Howard, a re- deemed, sanctified spirit, purified in the furnace here, and made meet for the joys of hereafter, which are so great, that neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to coiceive them.       I   HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XVI. "A charge to keep I have, A God to glorify." - WESLEY. Two years have elapsed since the events narrated in the preceding chapter,- years which have brought no sorrows, but rather have added joys to the family at Rosedale; for Baby George, as Felice leaYned to call him, has become a stout two-and-upwards yearling, already manifesting his boy-nature by his passion for miniature horses, whips, trumpets, and other playthings suited to his sex; and this, too, despite the girl's frock which he still wears, and which he is beginning to look upon with some scorn, since Johnny Carter, only a few months his senior, has arrived at the dignity of pants and sacks. Baby George, however, is in fact baby no longer; not only on account of his size and strength and other at- tainments, being, as Mrs Musgrave avers, almost as fine and healthy a child as her own Jamie was; but also, because another baby fills his mother's arms and his cradle, in the person of Helen Temple Norton, a young lady who has come to the advanced age of three months, and whom nurse and partial friends pronounce papa's image, and as fine a little girl as was ever seen. Felice looks upon the new claimant on Mamma Delia's love with perhaps a pang at her heart, but still with much more composure than she had regarded Master George's appearance. She has kept her promise to dear Uncle Howard, who, though dead, yet speaks to her   young heart in the fond memories she cherishes of him, and has tried to do what is right, and to love George and Helen. A great change has come over her out- wardly, as well as in character; for she is now a bright, active, healthy-looking girl, only noticeable from other children by the expression of her large liquid black eyes. She has given up her patois of French and Eng- lish, and now speaks the latter language entirely, ex- cepting, when she is very much excited, a few French words will escape her. She spends a good deal of her leisure time out of school with little George, and watches him with all a mother's solicitude, quite pleasing to witness. One day, she and the nurse and two children were out in Mr. Norton's grounds by the pond, memorable Is Howard Leslie's bath, which now had a flagged walk around it, and pleasant paths diverging in various direc- tions to the lane, wood, and house. The nurse was holding the baby in her arms by the brink of the pond, and Felice was pointing out to George the reflection of the trees in the water, and discoursing somewhat gravely upon the cause of suclkan appearance, although proba- bly not very intelligibly to her youthful auditor. At that moment they were startled by a loud noise, as of some animal rushing towards them with great speed. The nurse, turning round, was terrified at beholding a large dog close upon them, with his tongue projecting, and furious, if not mad. Starting up with little Helen, she seized George's hand at the very moment that the infuriated creature, in whose path the child was, caught his clothes in his teeth. It was the work of an instant- for Felice to lay hold of the dog and draw him away, and this she did so effectually that he bit her arm. At this juncture, while the children were screaming with 15*  174      HERE AND HEREAFTER: fright, and the nurse was ineffectually striving to drive  the dog away, herself almost frightened out of her sen- ses, a loud whistle was heard, and immediately a rough- looking man approached with hasty strides, and cried, "Down, sir, down, Lion!" and then with heavy hand dealt blow after blow upon the brute, which seemed al- most conscious that he deserved punishment. It was time; for Felice, already pale as death, fainted entirely away the moment the danger was past. Immediately the man turned toward the nurse, and said: "What can I do for ye, Miss? I'm sorry my dog has got ye into sich a scrape; but he's been worried almost to death by a score of pesky little brutes down in the village, yonder." "He's not mad?" gasped the frightened girl. "Bless yer soul, no, not a bit of it, only as you or I would be, if our tempers was up. Is that gal Squire Norton's?" taking some water from the pond as he spoke, and sprinkling her face, and then rubbing her cold hands in his hard, bony palms. "Yes ; no,--not his own, but a niece. O dear, will she never come to?" "I'm sorry enough for this business. Lay down, sir, and don't stir till I come back. Squire Norton's the best man I knows on here abouts. He got me out of a scrape last year on condition I'd sign the pledge. Tell you what, Miss; you go ahead and show the way, and I'll take the little gal along; taint no use stayin' here. Bless my soul, how that chap does holler; can't ye stop his pipes nohow?" This referred to little George, who, upon seeing the man take up Felice, recommenced the cries, which had been hushed when the dog was called off; and now it was some moments before he could be pacified at all.   OR, THE TWO, ALTARS.      175 Little Helen was already quiet, looking with the grave eyes of three months upon the scene. And so they took the way to the liouse. They liad not gone far before Felice began to show signs of returning consciousness. Murmuring that name so dear to her, Uncle Howard, she opened her eyes and looked about her like one be- wildered, but upon seeing where she was, she said faintly: "Put me down, I can walk, and Mamma Delia will be frightened."' ' Yes, put her down," said the nurse, " it is best; if she can't walk, you can take her up again." Finding that the girl could walk, or rather totter along, for she was resolute not to be taken up again, the man said: "If I can't be no use, I 'll go and see to my dog, yonder. I 'll1come down to-night and see how the little gal is." When Annette and the children reached home, there was no little consternation at Felice's appearance, and of astonishment at her heroic conduct. Mrs. Norton took her in her lap, and -after dressing and binding up the wounded arm, and soothing her agitated nerves, asked her how she had the courage to do such a brave thing? "I don't know, Mamma Delia," she answered, " un- less God helped me, as Uncle Howard said he would if I asked him. When I saw the dog bite at little George, I thought of Uncle Howard; and I did ask God to help me save him. I thought the dog was mad: I read the other day about one." "Did you not know, my darling, that if he had been, and had bitten you, it might have caused your death?" "Yes, Mamma Delia, but I knew it was right for me to take care of little George and if I did what was right, God would take care of me."   176      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "But why should you think it was right to take care of little George at tthe risk of your own life, perhaps, Felice? i' "O, because I am older and stronger than he is, and beside, I promised Uncle Howard I would try and love him and be good to him. It would not have been good to him to run away and let that big dog tear him to pieces. And then, was n't it strange, Mamma Delia, that my verse this morning was, 'Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.' Now I should not think it very kind in anybody older and stronger than I, to let me get hurt V"  Unbidden tears of gratitude came to Mrs. Norton's- eyes, and her heart was too full for- a few minutes to allow her to speak. Was not the seed sown, springing up and bearing fruit? And were not this child's heroic conduct, and the feelings which prompted it, convincing proof, if any such had been needed, that the precepts of religion, exemplified in all the daily walks and acts of life, exercise a mastering influence in forming the characters of the young? Natural instinct would have led Felice to think first of herself and her own danger, but duty, as it had been inculcated by Uncle Howard, and as it is taught in Scripture, caused her to act in quite a different way. Without ostentation, without cant or hypocrisy, it was the aim of the heads of the household at Rosedale to live in conformity with the Gospel of Christ; and this they were convinced could only be done by making it the underlying principle of all their actions; the con- trolling influence of their whole life; of their pleasures as well as their duties; its requirements never to be postponed to a more convenient season; tnle labors which   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       1" it enjoins never to be jostled out of their place by more engrossing engagements or pursuits. It was a leading article in their creed, that all thiings should be done to the glory of God, the most insignificant no less than the most important their hands might find to do. And how can the Creator be better glorified than by the consist- ent, virtuous lives of his intelligent creatures? A poor washerwoman was once asked if she never tired of her ceaseless round of labor, to which she answered : "Bless your heart, no. I expect if the Lord made me a wash- erwoman, he's as willing to be glorified by my doing such work, as if I was set up in one of the high places of the world; and I expect if we glorify him, that 's the most of our concern. He'll take care of the rest." This was the aim of Leslie and Delia Norton, for them- selves and their household. To say that they failed of realizing to the fullest extent their aim, is only to ac- knowledge that they were mortal. But at the same time, that they had succeeded in making the law of the spirit of liife in Christ Jesus the law of their house was evident from the explanation which Felice gave of the cause of her acting as she did at the pond, showing that Bible texts were not to her lessons which she daily read, or learned to repeat only, but that they were also rules of conduct. Two years had brought changes to other families in N   , as well as to that at Rosedale. Annie Clarke had ripened into a lovely maturity under the happy in- fluences of her home at Elm Hill, and she was now a beautiful, intelligent, animated girl, with a freshness of thought, and a native simplicity of manner, which, added to her charms of person, made her an object of interest to all her friends and acquaintances. She was not a belle, however, for most young men were more    repulsed by tne simplicity which neither sought nor  wished for such admiration as they have to bestow, than they would have been by the utmost hlauteur and frigid- J ity of manner. She was not gay; the circumstances of her early youth had been unfavorable to any great liveliness of disposition; but she was cheerful, with that serene, equable cheerfulness which seldom knows a cloud or a shadow. She was happy in her own lot, happy in her friends, and most of all, happy in her brother, who had become a steady, reliable man of business, and whose letters, written as they were in an honest, self-reliant tone, proved the change which had been wrought in the impulsive and misguided youth. Miss Ellis still guarded her charge with an unfalter- ing care and watchfulness, and was not very graciously styled by certain young men, whom she kept at bay from her garden of Hesperus, the Dragon. A very cheerful, handsome dragon she was, however, on the whole, and as yet, quite at ease with regard to Annie's heart, which she judged was still safe in her own keep- ing, despite some sieges which she suspected it had sus-  tained from Howard Leslie and Mr. Hill, although the former declared his interest in the, science of botany had somewhat declined; and the latter affirmed that Miss Annie was a star to be worshipped only in the heavens, from which she had strayed, and to which she would some day return, without having been contain- inated by any admixture of earth. Mrs. Musgrave still pursued her course of prosper- ous happiness, and was as active and:-influential as ever, and more literary. Mrs. Carter id grown paler and thinner; her large eyes larger, and more wonider- fully expressive than of old, under the pressure of family cares, and the secret sorrows of her doiestic relations.                ,   JL I 7 CHAPTER XVII. "If a man is not rising upward to be an angel, depend upon it, he is sinking ownward to be a devil." - S. T. COLERIDGE. MR. FITZROY'S handsome house had been so enlarged and improved, as to have become almost ,4 palatial " in its dimensions and arrangements. When his ward, Miss Clavers, came to reside with them, he deemed it neces- sary to add another wing to the building, to accommo- date her, her maid, and her governess. As for Mrs. Fitzroy, her face bears the unmistakable signs of late hours, fatigue, excitement, and dissipation, which make such sad wreck of so many of our American ladies in their early womanhood.     A  puny child of six months, her oldest and only one, does not add much to her care, being left to the tender mercies of a nurse, who fills a mother's office in addition to her own, and is supposed to be well provided for.  Mr. Fitzroy could not think of his wife's confining herself to the care of an infant, since it might interfere with some of his arrangements, and she herself had now become too thoroughly ab- sorbed in her life of pleasure to utter the feeble remon- strance which rose to her lips when this plan was pro- posed.  But was Clara     Fitzroy happy?    Was that luxurious' morning room, remote 'from the nursery, where she passed her leisure hours, a haven of rest to her weary spirit?  She shall speak for herself; for as yet she re- tains her habit of confidential communication with her   180      HERE AND HEREAPTER: cousin, well knowing that she lias in her a kind and patient listener. Mrs. Norton having heard that little Clarence, the baby, was unwell, had gone on one of her now infrequent visits to Oak Park. In answer to in- quiries respecting the child, Mrs. Fitzroy said: "I don't know what can be the matter with him, I'm sure, Delia. Dr. Grant asked me if we ever gave him any quieting drops. I'm sure I did n't know what to say, for you know nurse might give him  anything and I should n't know it; only I had such an excellent rec- ommendation of her that I did n't suppose she would." "Do you mean, Clara, that you really don't know what Mrs. March gives your child?" asked Delia, shocked at Mrs. Fitzroy's indifference. "No, to be sure, how should I? She understands the care of babies, and I'm sure I don't; she's had three of her own, and Mrs. Hightop, Elenore's aunt, said she nursed two of her children, and they were the best and most quiet of her five. To be sure, one of them died before the nurse left, and the other is the stupidest looking thing I ever saw; but I don't suppose that's the nurse's fault; for of all the dull old men I ever knew, Mr. Hightop is the dullest. Heigh-ho; but there 's lots of dull people in the world, Delia. Don't you find there are?" "u Why, no, Clara, I don't think I do. I find a great many pleasant and agreeable people." "O, I forgot; you go in for goodness, and intellect, and all that. We are quite content with rank and fashion. But would you like to see baby, Delia? I dare say he 's a contrast to your children; Mrs. March says they are so healthy-looking she 's astonished."' "And shocked too, perhaps," said Delia, smiling, at their want of gentility. Well, you know I did n't   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.   .   181 have a genteel nurs: ^$1Alem. Let me take the baby," she said to a young girlrs, March's assistant, who Caine in with the little languid-looking child. "O don't, Delia, he 'll tumble your dress if you do." "Never mind that, Clara; my dresses are tumbled at home." And as she held out her hands, the little sickly thing smiled and made a motion towards her. "Wily," said Clara, with something like a pang at her heart, " he really wants to go to you." "Leave him with me for a while, if you please," said Delia to the girl. "I will ring when we are tired of each other. Clara" as the door closed after the girl "this dear child looks sick, dull, and heavy too. Are you sure your nurse does not give him some kind of drops to keep him quiet? I have heard of such things, dreadful as it seems. O Clara, do look after him your- self. You don't know the pleasure you are denying yourself, to say nothing of duty."  "' O, don't talk to me about duty, Delia; you know it s no use," replied Clara, almost vehemently. "As for pleasure, that's quite another thing. Why, when Clarence was born, I did have some strange feelings of delight, such as I never experienced before; and I thoughllt if I could nurse and take care of the dear little helpless thing, I should be better and happier; and I ,made up my mind that I would, when Mr. Fitzroy said, 'Of course, Clara, you won't think of nursing the child yourself.' I told him I had thought of it, and then he ridiculed the idea, and said I should have to give up society, and represented the whole matter in such a light, that I began to think I was foolish to have had such an idea. Then, when I spoke to Dr. Grant about it, he looked grave, and said, with I think a little sar- casm in his tone, ' Doubtless Providence intended moth- 16   ers to be their children's nurses; but under the cir- cumstances, perhaps, it will- be best for you to procure one for your child.' I don't know what he meant by ' under the circumstances,' I'm sure. It could not be the pleasure and society I should have been obliged to give up, for you know he does n't believe in such things any more than you do. Perhaps he thinks I'm not in a fit state of health ; but whatever he thinks, I do wish he would n't look so very gravely at me, when I give my reasons for doing or not doing certain things. It always seems as if he thought a great deal he does n't say. If I had not so much confidence in him, and re- spect for him, I would employ Dr. Belton; he's gay and lively in a sick-room, and I fancy does n't trouble his head about his patients' lives, if they pay his fees. I hate a doctor who distresses himself about one's duties." "Dr. Grant never says anything to you upon such subjects, does he, Clara?" "Says? No; but I know half the timne what he thinks. Some people have a wonderful faculty of silent speech; eyes and face expressing what they do not wish or think it best to say themselves." Mrs. Norton was surprised at Clara's extreme sensi- tiveness. The time had been when she would not have noticed her physician's grave looks, or if she did, would have laughed at them. She looked earnestly at her. She was pale and languid, her eyelids drooped over hler- eyes, which had an unnatural glitter, and her man- ner was restless and uneasy. There was some hidden cause for this unusual appearance. Might not this be a fitting moment to speak to her kindly? Now, with her child before her, might not her heart be touched? And if she was little by little yielding to a fatal habit   VAR, am TWO ALTABRS.      18 which would destroy her happiness and ruin her re- spectability, was not now the time to warn her? She thought it was, and conscious that no other than kind and Christian feelings influenced her, without which she well knew that words of advice would only add fuel to the flame, she spoke. tHer voice was so tender and gentle, and yet so sad in its tones, that Mrs. Fitzroy's attention was fixed at once. "Look at this dear babe, Clara, whom God has sent to you for you to love and cherishl; look at his sweet smile, and tell me if it does not carry more joy to your heart than any of the pleasures so called of your usual life. I believe, Clara, that this child's life depends on you, and you alone.  I don't think Mrs. March a faithful person, and I have good reason for'what I say. And even if she is as faithful as the average of her class, ,an you expect from her what you fail to do yourself? Your better nature is striving now within you; listen to its promptings, dear Clara. Give up this toil of ex- stence, which affords you no happiness, give it up; :ake care of your child. God will make him a teacher ;o you, if you will but open your eyes and ears to all "s innocent ways and wants. "And forgive me, Clara; but in remembrance of your ather's years of suffering from the upbraidings of a nce neglected conscience, do not expose yourself to the ame terrible retribution. I have no right, I claim one, save that of interest and friendship, to counsel ou,; but, Clara, let me speak, and do not harden your eart against me. I am convinced you are keeping up our strength by false and artificial stimulants, which ill eventually prove your destruction. Abandon them 1 at once, and let this darling plead his cause with Du.   le has an immortal soul; and upon you, in a   184      HERE AND HEREAFTER: great measure, rests his destiny. Truly, a mother may speak to a mother, and a child may entreat his parent." So saying, she arose and placed the little Clarence in his mother's arms. She received him silently, and clasped him to her breast, while tears rained fast down her cheeks. Presently the child began to cry, and moved uneasily towards Delia. He was unused to his mother's close embrace, -it frightened him, and he did not like the hot tears which fell upon him, or appar- ently the expression of her countenance; for his little lip took that grieved form so touching to witness in infancy. "'It's no use, Delia," almost sobbed Mrs. Fitzroy, i' my own child is against me. He does n't love me. It is my fault, I know; but you see how it is." "For that very reason, Clara, you should strive now to win him back. O, consider what a fearful risk you run in losing your influence over your child." "I tell you it 's no use, -no use. I migliht do as you advise; perhaps, if I had any one to uphold me in it; but I am not, now as I was once,--resolute, deter- mined to have my own way." "Are you happy now, Clara? Two years ago- you told me you thought you were." "Happy? O Delia, is there such a word? Is there such a reality as happiness? I have, all my life, been seeking it, and it only. Now I think oblivion is' all I could ask or wish., It 's no use trying to deceive you, Delia. The truth is, I must live as I do, or I should not have even the semblance of peace with my husband. As it is, my life is wretched enough; though I don't wish you to think Mr. Fitzroy is unkind, that is, abu- sive. Men, all but such model husbands as yours, Delia, think it no harm to wound their wives with their   OR, THE TWO ALTAAS.       185 tongues and looks. O no, wives are safety-valve,; upon them they can vent the anger caused by the lIghts of others, disappointments in business, leadacl, &c, &c. So I believe my husband as kind as the average of men of his stamp. As to my taking stimulants, Delia, of course that shocks you; but then it is not an unheard- of. thing, I believe. If I don't look and appear bril- liant and animated, Mr. Fitzroy is - well, not pleased. The long and the short of it is, Delia, you've done your duty, and I respect you for it; but I 've chosen my lot in life, and must abide by it. I cannot set myself in- opposition to my husband: you would n't advise that. So, if you please, we will talk of something else. I promise you, though, that I'll look after little Clarence. Jane," to the young girl who answered the bell, ' tell Mrs. March I should like to see her." Mrs. March came in, in no very great haste, and with unmistakably offended dignity in her manner.    She, who had nursed in the first families for so many years, was accustomed to be treated with the deference becom- ing her position. Besides, she knew her power, and was not the first person who abused it-to a young, weak mother. '"Did you send for me, ma'am?" '"Yes, Mrs. March; sit down, do. We think baby ooks sick.  I hope you don't give him any quieting Irops, or anything of that sort. Many mothers, I know, re willing such things should be used," she added, in n apologetic manner, " but I prefer they should not." "Mrs. George Washington    Smythe, Mrs. Mortimer afayette Pyke, Mrs.  Helvetius Hightop, have all em- loyed me, ma'am, as nuss to their offspring. I am of Minion that I  give satisfaction, entire and total. If herwise is the case with this infant, I begs to give a 16 3                 ,   186      HERE AND HEREAFTER: week's notice and retire to my humble cottage in the subbubs of Boston, where natur calls so loudly in my own darling baby girl, which I left at Mrs. Hightop's- earnest objurations on your account, ma'am.," "' You do give me perfect satisfaction, Mrs. March. You could n't think of leaving Clarence now, teething and all; and I'm sure if there is anything more that can be done to relieve you it -shall be. You might have - an older girl than Jane to assist you. I only meant to suggest to you that perhaps sedatives did not agree with Clarence." "Suggestions is tryin' to the feelings, ma'am, of a conscientious person, as I opinionate I am. I am well pleased with Jane; she is handy, and Master Clarence is fond of her; and she makes my chocolate right, which is a great item for the baby and me, ma'am." She might have added, that Jane was so completely under her jurisdiction, that she asked no questions nor told no tales, when orders were given. "I'm willin' to stay, ma'am, if confidence is placed in me. Confidence, as I told Mrs. Smythe, is perquisite to success in my business. I'm not exacting; no, meekness is my failin', Mrs. Mortimer Lafayette Pyke says." So saying, this much-injured woman withdrew from the room, leaving Mrs. Fitzroy almost frightened at her own presumption, and Mrs. Norton indignant at the nurse and grieved at her cousin's willingness to be im- posed upon. Mrs. Norton afterwards, in giving an account of the interview to Mrs. Temple, said she never felt so strongly disposed before, " to speak up and unmask the woman on the spot." "' A proceeding which would utterly have astonished   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       187 her, I imagine, coming from you, Delia," was the re- ply. "You don't often speak up now-a-days, I fancy." "No. I suffered enough in regrets for hasty speech in my early days, but sometimes the temptation is al- most too strong upon me for resistance." An occasion soon occurred which proved quite too strong a temptation for her, but when, as she told her husband, she did not in the least regret what she said, only that she was so terribly angry the while. Mrs. Harris gave a picnic in September in her grounds, which extended down to the Charles River. The com- pany, including all, as she said, respectable people, were invited to come at three o'clock in the afternoon for the enjoyment of rows on the river and various games in the groves and onl the lawns of the estate. Tea- was to be served at five, on tables in a beautiful wood, one side of which was open to the western sky. Mrs. Norton was among those who came early. The more fashiona- ble part of the company postponed their visit until near tea-time, and among these were Mr. and Mrs. Fitzroy. Delia no sooner saw her cousin than she noticed her flushed face and  unnaturally excited manner.  She hoped, however, although very much disturbed by it herself, that she would not be observed bvyothers, and that a cup of strong coffee would counteract the effect of the stimulant she had evidently been taking.  But Mrs. Grey, who seemed to take an. ill-natured delight in exposing other people's failings, called her next neighbor's attention to Mrs. Fitzroy, and so she soon became an object of general observation. Delia, per- ceiving it, tried to persuade her to walk down to the water's edge, thinking the cool evening  breeze might be of service to her.  She however refused, in a tone so loud  and gay, that her husband's attention was at-   188      HERE AND HEREAFTER: tracted to her. Immediately perceiving the state of things, and coming to her, he whispered something fiercely in her ear; arid then taking her to Mrs. Harris, he apologized for their abrupt departure, saying that Mrs. Fitzroy had made a great effort to come, having a- violent headache, and had found the exertion too much, as she was now faint and sick. Faint she was, for her husband's words had driven the blood from her cheeks, and she was scarcely able to stand. Mrs. Norton fol- lowed them to the carriage, and said to Mr. Fitzroy, "I will go with you, my cousin needs a woman's care," in a tone so decided that he did not venture to oppose her, although a heavy frown rested on his face. Arrived at the house, she assisted Mrs. Fitzroy up stairs into her morning room, where, after having aided her in bath- ing her face and hands in cold water, she sat down beside her as she lay upon her couch. Presently Mr. Fitzroy came in. He appeared to be so very angry with his wife that le could not restrain himself any longer. As he entered, his wife said: "O, don't, my head aches so!" "Don't what, Mrs. Fitzroy? Don't come to see my wife, who has made such a pretty spectacle of herself to-day? Don't come to see a woman so " and he finished the sentence in language too coarse and dis- gusting to be repeated on these pages; and then added a volley of oaths to enforce his declaration, that if ever she exposed herself and disgraced him in that manner again, he would send her to a hospital. ", I wish you would, and let me die there; any- thing but such a life as this." "Who obliges you to live such a  life? Have you not everything money can buy?" "Mr. Fitzroy," here interfered Delia, who had   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      189 arisen from her seat upon his entrance, and stood there, her slight frame erect, her head elevated with that pecu- liar haughty curve so familiar to her former friends, and her blue eyes flashing,-" money cannot buy your wife affection and respect, neither of which it seems do you entertain for her." "Respect! Who can respect a woman like that, who has disgraced her name thus?" "Can she disgrace the name she now bears, sir, or hin from whom she received it? Can she, when you know that it is owing to you and to your influence that she has come to this? Who has wished her to appear day after day and night after night in society, gay and animated and brilliant? Who has led her to resort to stimulants to keep up her flagging spirits and failing health? Who has led- her deeper and deeper into the vortex of the world? Who has fed her vanity, minis- tered to her love of pleasure, opposed her desire to be a true mother to her child? Whoever has done this, Mr. Fitzroy, is the one upon whom this disgrace chiefly rests, and who is chiefly accountable for it; and it is an accountability at which he may well tremble." Mr. Fitzroy was not a brave man in the presence of a virtuous woman,- men of his stamp seldom are; and although his countenance expressed anger and rage, it also expressed mortification. But he was not to be cowed at once. "I thank you, madam," he answered, " for your kind interference in my domestic affairs. But I beg to re- mind you that Mrs. Fitzroy had some tastes and habits of her own, which she contracted previous to our mar- riage. I took her from the world you so righteously scorn, and not from a convent, or even from the bosom of a pious, saintly family; Fashion and pleasure were not words unknown to her in her maiden life."   190      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "Be that as it may, sir, you are well aware her tastes might have been turned in a different direction, and that under different influences she would have acquired a love for other pursuits. However strong my feelings for my cousin might have been, I should never have presumed to interfere between her and her husband, but for your harsh and unmanly treatment of her this evening. I will not speak of the language you have used, sir, but this much I must and will say: Clara Fitzroy's infatuated indulgence of a most disgusting habit, either in man or woman, is owing to your urging her beyond her strength, or even her inclinations, into the frivolities and dissipations of fashionable society. If she persists in it after to-day's mortification, I shall think, sir, it will be as much your fault as her's, al- though I am far from wishing' to excuse one of my sex for a habit so revolting to feminine delicacy and purity." Here Mrs. Fitzroy, whose face had been hidden in her hands, groaned audibly, and her form shook with emotion. "Perhaps, madam," said Mr. Fitzroy, 4 as I have an engagement at this hour, which requires my attention, you will now excuse me. And allow, me to suggest, that it may answer your purpose quite as well to give your respected cousin, my wife, the benefit of the re- mainder of your lecture." Bowing low, as he spoke, he retreated out of the room before there was time for a reply, had Mrs. Norton been disposed to make one. But Mrs. Norton had no reply to make. Convinced, as she was, that Mr Fitzroy deserved all the indignation she had visited upon him, she yet had that uncomfort- able feeling which a conscientious person always expe- riences after having been unduly excited. It was not a   ---, *-L- -A,-y Y AJl'l'aS.  191 righteous scorn only, which caused her to say what she did to that unprincipled man of the world, but it was positive' anger also,--anger which flushed her 'cheeks dilated her form, and trembled in her voice. She had no time now, however, to dwell upon her own feelings. Her cousin's groans continued, and it was evident she was suffering. It was her duty now, not to seek to lessen those sufferings, but to point out to that shame- stricken woman the inevitable consequences of the habit, which, little by little, had led to this result, and which, if persisted in, would sink her lower and lower into the slough of degradation. "Clara," she said,  ', rouse yourself, and do not give way to useless remorse. Determine once and for ever to abandon all stimulants whatever, whether as medi- cine or in any other form. This day's exposure may be overlooked, or the real cause may not have been sus- pected; but it will not be so again. I entreat you, by your remembrance of the vilest and most jloathsome forms in which you yourself have witnessed this degra- dation, to stop now  while you  have the power.      O Clara, you a wife and a mother, capable of living a useful and virtuous life, to give yourself up to such a vice!  Say it shall never be so again.' And Delia took the cold hand of the miserable penitent in her burning one. "0 Delia, I dare not promise; but don't you desert me. I     will try, --yes, I  will try; but I  have not much strength of will now.  O Delia, how you must  "No, Clara, no. I pity you, from the bottom of my heart I   pity you. -Do not give me  any occasion to de- spise you.  Renounce once and for ever this dreadful habit,   Which so debases you as a  woman."   lkY/     HERE AND HEREAFTER: "I will try, Delia, - I will try. But you don't know. It has been so long coming on, and now when I 'm tired and sick, and know that I must dress and appear at dinner or in the evening, what can I do but take sole- thing to rouse me?" "You can be a true woman, Clara. If you are sick, remain at home; if you are not, you violate no moral law by going to a party pale and languid, as you cer- tainly do in the other case." "O Delia, I wish I had never accustomed myself to drink champagne and wine, and take ices. I formed a taste for these things in my girlhood. Mr. Fitzroy was right, Delia; my habits were formed before lie married me." "Which is no reason for your persisting in them now. They will surely prove your ruin if you do. But I must go, Clara. I will come to see you as often as I call find time, and will help you all I can. But this one thing you must do: you must give up at once all stimulants and take care of your own health and your child's." "I will try, Delia; but Mr. Fitzroy - " "Does not wish to kill you, Clara; and is no ogre, after all. His eyes are, perhaps, now open to the inju- diciousness of urging you beyond your strength. To- morrow I will see you again."   On, THE TWO ALTABS.         193 CH{APTER XVIII. "There is a Reaper, whose name is Death,' And, with his sickle keen, He reaps the bearded grain at a breath, And the flowers that grow between. "He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes, He kissed their drooping leaves; It was for the Lord of Paradise He bound them in his sheaves." --LONGFELLOW. MRS. NORTON kept her promise to Clara Fitzroy, and was rewarded for her efforts in her cousin's improved habits, and, after a little time, health and spirits. She was not sure that she kept her word strictly, but she was rejoiced to witness any change for the better. Mr. Fitzroy she never saw, as she timed   her visits at hours wlhen she knew he would not be at home. Events soon occurred, however, which occupied her mind in another direction,  and finally her visits were suspended  alto- gether from  an entirely unforeseen cause. The part of N    in which Mr. Norton resided had always been considered very healthy; but this year a sickness prevailed so extensively throughout the whole town as to become an epidemic, and which reached, by degrees, to the most favored localities. One circum- stance attending its progress, which caused it to be re- garded with terror, was, that in the    majority of cases it was fatal in its results.  It commenced  in one of the manufacturing districts, and here in the  small, ill-ven-    194      HERE AND HEREAFTER: tilated, and often dirty houses, its ravages among the occupants were fearful. Among those most active in assisting the sick with their time, money, and advice, were Miss Ellis, Mrs. Musgrave, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Carter, and Mrs. Norton. These ladies were indefatigable in their efforts to pro- mote cleanliness, and to relieve the sick and suffering. Mrs. Brown, in particular, put her shoulder to the wheel in good earnest, in the time of distress and grief. She attended to her own household duties usually, and had family cares; but these she put aside, or left to other hands, saying no one would suffer if the work was n't done up quite so nice at home, and that it made her heart ache to see those poor creatures suffering for want of care. So she went from house to house, cleaning, washing, nursing; performing the last offices for the dead, and doing whatever her hands found to do with all her might; cheering the desponding by her hearty, hopeful manner; sympathizing with the afflicted in their grief; giving a word of counsel in good season to those who needed it; lightening the cares of the living, and smoothing the pillow of the dying with her strong, cheer- ful faith. All liked to have her about them; she knew them, most of them, at least, and their wants and feel- ings; and they knew her to be so genuine in her good- ness and disinterestedness, that they listened to her when the same advice from another would have been regarded as interference. She had had so much expe- rience in her life in sickness, having always been one of those good Samaritans who go about healing the sick, pouring in oil to their wounds, and wine to strengthen their hearts, that she was consulted by the other ladies as to the best modes of rendering assistance to those poor people.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       195 :, "Now," said- she, upon one occasion when the above- mentioned ladies met at her house to consult upon the best measures to be adopted for the relief of the suffer- ers, " if you 'll pay the bills, I 'll find some good nurses to come and take care of these poor folks. I'1l see to 'em, and don't you ladies be a coming here to take the sickness home to your families. 'You'll want all your health yourselves afore this trouble is over; it 'll not pass by without a brush at some of the great houses." "You don't mean to say, Mrs. Brown," said Mrs. Musgrave, with some anxiety in her face, ," that there;q- is any real danger of the disease among us, who are' careful and neat." "I mean to say jest this, Miss Musgrave, death is no respecter of persons. High and low, clean and dirty, is all one to him, when he's out with his sickle." "And you think this is an epidemic, that will spread beyond the district to which it is now mostly confined?v" asked Mrs. Norton. "Certain I do, Miss Norton. I don't wish to scare you' but once before in my life I've seen the working of this sickness, and there's scarce a house in the place it did n't make' havoc in."  And the  strong woman shuddered at some remembrances which came over her. "So," she continued, "my   advice is, that you begin now to take care of yourselves and your children; stay away from that, place, and look after your young ones. If I want anything, I 'll send for it." "But do you incur no risk yourself, Mrs. Brown?" asked Mrs. Carter. "Your life is as valuable as ours; more so, probably, to the community." "Risk?  me? No; I aint afraid of any disease I ever saw yet; 'sides, I 've no little ones to take care of; my Jim  and Sue can look out for themselves; it's my   196      HERE AND HEREAFTER: duty to look after these poor folks. I was poor once, myself, and know what a hard rub they have in the best of times, let alone such troubles as this. But don't be down-hearted, ladies; keep up good courage, it's all the Lord's doing. He knows best when to purge his wheat." "Yes, yes," murmured. Mrs. Carter, pressing the good woman's hand, " that is the true comfort in life. We are in His hands always." "You are, for certain," said Mrs. Brown, in a low tone, as Mrs. Carter left the house, " one of His jewels, I reckon, and not long before you 'll be set in His crown too. Well, well, poor thing, the Lord will take care of her little ones, and she will be happy then." So Mrs. Brown pursued her labor of love, and the ladies, with the exception of Miss Ellis, followed her advice, and remained at home, watching over their own families. Miss Ellis, like Mrs. Brown, had no fears of any sickness, and, as she was healthy, strong, and cheer- ful, her presence, and her kind sympathizing words, were of themselves a great comfort to the sick and af- flicted. She could, too, administer a word of rebuke when needed, and generally to good purpose. Among the poor, suffering families at Riverside was one by the name of Green, which, from its trials in seasons of average health, was an object of interest to all benev- olent hearts. It consisted of a man, his wife, and five children, of whom a poor idiotic girl, and a sickly baby of eighteen months, were a constant care to their mother. Hannah Green, however, had been a woman of so much thrift, energy, and neatness, that she would have got along with more ease with these heavy cares, than most- persons with far lighter ones, but for two additional and greater troubles, in the persons of her husband and   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      197 eldest child and daughter, Ann. The former was a miserable drunkard and gambler, and a constant source of anxiety and mortification to his wife, and terror to his younger children; Ann was a stout, hearty girl of fourteen, with hair and eyes as black as jet, and a coun- tenance which expressed nothing good, certainly, but was a mixture of boldness, defiance, and self-will. Her mother, who, by the continual wearing of her great domestic troubles, had became an irritable, impetuous woman, had not the slightest control over her, and was forced to let her go on in her own way, which way was to sit the greater part of the time on the door-sill, or on a low stile, swinging her feet and staring at passers by, varying the monotony of such an employment by throw- ing stones at the wandering chickens of the neighbor- hood, or making up faces at the little children. In fact, Ann Grepn was apparently one of those girls sometimes to be found, who have no good qualities whatever to act upon. She would mimic her unfortunate idiot sister, worry the baby with good-natured slaps and grimaces,- for she never seemed out of temper, that is, angry, tease her brothers, sneer at her father, and ridicule her mother. Miss Ellis had once or twice tried persuasions and even entreaty to induce her to behave differently, but with no effect beyond a jeering answer from the girl. At this period of distress in the neighborhood, two of Mrs. Green's children were sick at once, a little boy and the baby. Miss Ellis came to the house, found Mrs. Green taking care of her sick as well as she could, trying to quiet the poor idiot, who, hearing the baby cry, had set up an accompaniment of a doleful, prolonged moan, while her husband lay in a drunken sleep upon the only large bed in the house, and Ann sat at the 17*   198.      HERE AND HEREAFTER: gate idling. Looking upon the man with the disgust she could not conceal, she gave the poor Sarah a few flowers she had in her hand to quiet her, and tried to give some appearance of order to the kitchen, and told Mrs. Green she should have some one to assist her in the care of her children, and some good food sent to her. She then went to the gate, and said sharply to Ann: "Why don't you help your mother? Have you no feeling at all, that you are willing to see her toil, and toil so hard, and you not lift a finger to help her? Have you no shame either?" "Well, I s'pose I haint, - everybody says so; and I s'pose it's most likely it's true, - s'pose they knows best," was the answer, half sullen, half laughing. Miss Ellis thought she would try her on another tack. "Should n't you like to get a place away from home, where you could earn your clothes and be taught to work, and by ann by get good wages?" "Reckon I should n't, - don't like to work; these ere clothes good as I want. Miss Howe tried to get me to come and live with her; guess I should n't like that, -too good at the parson's for me. Tell you what, Miss Ellis, I should like," fixing her bold black eyes- full upon that lady. "Well, what is it, Ann?" "Should like to have folks let me alone. I aint the town's child, that everybody is speering at me. That's what I should like." Another idea occurred to Miss EPllis,--one which she afterwards regarded almost as an inspiration; for this good woman believed that God does sometimes grant such assistance to his children in hours of doubt. "Should you not like to come up to my house and   On, THE TWO ALTARS.       199 get some books to read? I have some that would in- terest you." "Tracts and sich like?" "No, not tracts; at present you would not care to read those, I suppose; but stories. You can read?" "Reckon so,-a little. Is that ere Clarke gal at your house now?" "Miss Annie Clarke! - yes. "I 'll come. She 's pretty as a picter. I 'll come if you 'll let me see her." "Yes, if you 'll come with clean face and hands, and will mend your frock." The girl laughed, and, nodded; and Miss Ellis went home, satisfied that she had gained one point, at least, although, as she afterwards told Mrs. Brown, in her heart she would have liked at first to give her a good shaking.               . "Yes, and shook all the badness further into her. I guess she 's had enough of that in days gone by." Death, indeed, proved no respecter of persons, and was busy with his sickle in N---  that autumn, and reaped a large harvest among the old, young, and middle-aged,--rich and poor, robust and sickly. Of course, his harvest was less among those who took every precaution to preserve their health, and who, by tem- perance and cleanliness, raised the most effectual bar- riers against him; but even these proved ineffectual in all cases. Stealthily, but surely, this terrible reaper crept upwards with his sickle from Riverside to stately mansions and abodes of opulence and luxury. Mrs. Musgrave's family was the first of the latter class which he attacked, and two of her children, Lina and James, were taken down within twelve hours of each other.  The latter of the two appeared the most   200       HERE AND HEREAFTER: violently sick, though Dr. Grant looked very grave, as the almost distracted mother, in her terror forher son, said she thought Lina's sickness was slight compared with his. The boy wrestled, however, desperately with the destroyer, and while he was lingering, apparently for a short season only, on this side of the dark valley, Lina, the young, fair, graceful girl, her mother's pride and darling, died, - died at a time when her mother was utterly unprepared for the blow, which she had not expected, nor scarcely feared for one moment. Perhaps this was the first time in her life that Mrs. Musgrave had not felt sufficient unto herself; the first time she had ever known by experience the sorrow she had so often counselled others to bear with fortitude. It was a dreadful shock to her; the greater because she had always kept such fast hold of her children for earth, -never seeming to regard them as treasures, perhaps lent only for a season. She was a warm-hearted, devoted mother; and over this, her great first sorrow, let the curtain fall! God speaks not in vain to his children, and in this new revelation of his love by the discipline of affliction, let us trust Mrs. Musgrave read lessons which she never before had thought of doing. Mr. Harris's father, a good, venerable old man, who had lived in his son's .home for many years, only a greater cipher there than that son himself, was the next to yield up his willing spirit to the God he had so long served, walking in all the commandments and ordi- nances of the Lord blameless, and whose greatest trial for years had been the necessity of living among those whose time, strength, and gifts were devoted with such unwavering constancy to the service 'of the world.  X A few days passed, and Mr. and Mrs. Wellwood, whose elegant house and grounds adjoined Mr. Harris's, were   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       201 called to carry forth their dead in the person of their only son, heir to vast wealth; and who, alas! had never known any other riches than those this world furnishes and for a season their grief was as those who sorrow without hope. Mr. and Mrs. Howe, whose hearts had so often bled for the griefs of their people, and whose sympathies had been so keenly excited by their distresses, were now called for the first time to suffer bereavement in their own household,--hitherto an unbroken family circle. Their third child, a bright, promising boy of six years, one day came to his mother, brought her his whip, top, cart, and some other playthings, and saying, "Mamma put them away for little Harry," laid his head upon her lap, and was soon after taken to his bed, from which he never rose again. In four days he was one more'of God's child-angels in heaven; and they, who had felt so much for the sorrows of their friends and people, were not left without the support of the Comforter. "Death loves a shining mark"; and when it was said that he had already laid his icy hand upon the fair, young brow of Mrs. Carter, not a heart among those who knew her but felt a pang of grief almost like that of personal sorrow. " O," said one, she, so young, so gifted, so saintly; she so much needed here, to die! It cannot be. Is there no hope?"Another said : "She, to die now in the fair promise of her early womanhood; she, who has suffered so much, enjoyed so little, to die now when it almost seems as if her cold, unsympathiz- ing husband is awaking to a sense of the treasure he possesses." Yes, so God willed it, and she died with a serene smile upon her face. As Delia Norton, who had learned to love her almost like a sister, laid her hand upon her pure forehead, and closed those eyes which in   202      HERE AND HEREAFTER: life had been so eloquent, she said: God knoweth best." When first attacked, Mrs. Carter said to Mrs. Norton, in the same calm tone and gentle manner which al- ways characterized her: "I shall not recover, I am sure I shall not, and I do not wish to. Very pleasant to me are the thoughts of my Father's mansions." "But your children," said Delia. "My children? Yes, that is hard to think of; but you know, dear friend, God takes care of us all." Blessed faith! This had strengthened her in life; this sustained her in death. To her husband she said these few words: "Joseph, I have loved you always. If you have not fully understood me, the day may come in our Father's kingdom when it will be otherwise. Be gentle and loving to our little children." During her sickness, her husband seemed like one stunned by some unexpected blow. The thought that his gentle, calm, uncomplaining wife might die, had never occurred to him. When the event came, it so affected him that he sat like one transfixed to stone, and no persuasions could induce him to leave the body for hours. "This is my place," were the only words he uttered. He shed no tear, but remained in a state of deadness to all outward objects, while the prepara- tions for his wife's funeral were going on, and even un- til her coffin was about to be closed. Affectionate hands had laid around her white flowers almost as pure and beautiful as she herself in her burial shroud, with no trace of earthly passion upon her lovely coun- tenance. From her cold, cold hand, he took one white flower, pressed it to his lips, then placed it in his breast; and then, the strong, cold, stern man wept for the first time for years ; then, for the first time, he realized what   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       203 his wife had been to him; then all her virtues, her spot- less life, arose before him. Ah, why do so many harden their hearts against the blessings God has given, and discover their value only when they are lost to them for ever! only when the night of the grave rests upon them! Mr. Carter had never been an unkind husband in one sense; not even in the sense in which Mrs. Fitzroy had said most men were. He had never, perhaps, spoken an angry word to his wife; he had ministered to her outward wants with a liberal, unsparing hand; he had laid no restrictions upon her pleasures and pursuits, otherwise than by not sharing them with her; but he had never sought to #penetrate into the inner life of the modest, shrinking- girl, who came to his arms a fair young bride, with all the sweet hopes and fond anticipations of her pure, guileless nature ; he never sought to ascertain her tastes, her habits of thought, her intellectual attainments and acquirements. In fact, he had never thought it neces- sary women should have such; and in his contempt for the class to which Mrs. Musgrave belonged, whose very faults and pretentiousness are probably owing to men more than to their own weakness of character, he forgot that there might be mines of intellectual wealth and beauty in woman, well worth the trouble of working, and whose ore would be pure gold. And thus it happened that Emily Carter and her hus- band sustained the most intimate relation to each other,- a relation which, in its true,existence, admits no shadow of doubt, no withholding of confidence, which, from the different yet blending qualities of man and woman, should indeed induce a oneness of feeling and purpose, as intended by Providence ; they lived this life together,;' far as the poles asunder in heart and tastes. Many   204      HERE AND HEREAFTER: women would have borne up under it. Many women do, we suppose. Mrs. Carter did, also, for many years. But how it wore upon her spirit; how it repressed the throbbings of her heart; how it stilled the pulses of her inner life, can only be imagined by those to whom Providence has given like delicate sensibilities and shrinking humility. . The friends--and that the human heart beats re- sponsive to true goodness was proved by the fact that X those who attended this funeral service were truly such -did not, could not feel unmixed sorrow upon this occasion. The remembrance of her many virtues, of her modesty and humility, her steadfast devotion to duty, gave so firm an assurance of her happy change, the expression upon her countenance was so pure, so holy, that they felt, "' It is the Lord, he hath taken her to himself, no more to suffer, no more to sorrow." So they went to their homes with chastened and subdued feelings, realizing that it is better to go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting. During all this period of sickness and distress, "While the air is full of farewells to the dying, And mournings for the dead," Leslie and Delia Norton sympathized with the bereaved, and did all in their power to console them; and, for their constant efforts, in one way and another, to bind up the wounds of the sorrowing and afflicted, received their reward in having no leisure to indulge gloomy forebodings for their own household. To say that they were not anxious, and that they did not sometimes trem- ble, in view of the hour when their turn might come to suffer and mourn, would be false to human nature and false to fact, in the case of fond, devoted parents, such   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       205 as they were.  But any such apprehensions did not in- terfere with their duties at home, or to their neighbors, although, following Mrs. Brown's advice, Delia did not go much among the sick, excepting to Mrs. Carter, who needed some friend to be with her. After taking every precaution to preserve their health, and, as far as was practicable in the midst of the prevailing distress, keep up an equable cheerfulness in their household, they re- signed themselves into the Lord's hands, and awaited with fear and trembling, perhaps, but still with resigned faith, his will. For a while it seemed that the destroying angel had passed them by, since the disease had begun to abate in violence as well as in the numbers of its victims. But not so had it been ordained in -Heaven. He who know- eth all our ways, and the inmost thoughts of our hearts, saw that his young servants needed discipline, as who, alas! does not? At the very time when a sense of re- lief was felt throughout the community, as if some heavy cloud had been lifted from off them, Felice Las- celles was taken sick, and with some of the worst symp- toms of the disease, and soon after little George was seized also. Days passed, and all that love, devotion, and skill could do was done for the children, and at last Felice was pronounced out of danger. Dr. Grant would not give the same encouragement with regard to little George, who lay upon his bed a shadow of his former bright, loving, joyous self. "While there is life there is hope, Mrs. Norton," was all he could say. How common the remark! How significant to anxious hearts that the worst is feared! One day when the little fellow's parents were alone withhim, his father sitting beside him and his mother bending over him, he opened his eyes, and looking in 18   206       HERE AND HEREAFTER: her face, said, languidly: "Kiss Georgie, mamma; and papa, too. My wants to see baby, and Felice." "Felice is sick, my darling," said his mother; " and little Helen must not come to Georgie, lest she should be sick, too." "Kiss her, then, for Georgie,--my tired."     And closing his eyes, he sank into a heavy sleep. "O," said Delia, to her husband, " can we part with him, - our first-born, our darling?" 'c We can, dearest, if God wills it. The cup which our Father hath given us, shall we not drink it'?" Though the little child lingered on two days after this, he never spoke again, or seemed conscious of what was passing around him. But when the hour came that these loving hearts were to drink to the dregs this cup of sorrow, given them by the kind Physician who knows all our sicknesses and the healing thereof, when the summons came to their little boy to join "The sinless little children, Who have heard his 'Come to me'; "Where the wicked dare not enter, And the weary rest"; his beautiful eyes sought his mother, his little hand was outstretched to hers, and a smile of infant purity and sweetness passed over his countenance, and all was over in this world for little George, --all of trial, suffering, and sin. "Full short his journey was; no dust Of earth unto his sandals clave; The weary weight that old men must, He bore not to his grave. He seemed a cherub who had lost his way And wandered hither, so his stay With us was short, and 't was most meet   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.         207 That he should be no delver in earth's clod, Nor need to pause and cleanse his feet To stand before his God! O, blest word, - Evermore!!" For his father and mother in this, their first great sorrow, this sundering of a tie so holy and strong as that which binds Christian parents to their children, they knew in whom  they trusted, and they knew where to look for strength and comfort. Time will assuage the bitterness of this grief, Christian faith assure them that all is well with the child, but the wound itself which their hearts have sustained shall never be healed while life lasts. Hours of sorrow, almost as bitter as the first, shall sweep over their souls, as they recall from time to time their first-born, - their boy, - life of their lives, hope of their hearts; yet these hours of grief shall be for ever sanctified to them, and they be comforted; for they know that God doeth all things well.   208      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER     XIX. "For of such is the kingdom of Heaven." - MATT. XIX. 14. "I never saw a vessel of like sorrow So filled." - SHAKESPEARE. MRS. GREEN, who had lost both her children at the time of the sickness, the little boy and her baby, was almost heart-broken; and among all those whom Mr. Howe visited, at this period of woe, he found no one so utterly inconsolable. "Taint no use to-talk to me, Mr. Howe; you are very good, and I dare say you think your sorrows as heavy as mine. But jest see how 't is: I had five children, and I 'm sure I had a will to love 'em all; but you see what Ann is to me, and I can't love her much anyhow. .Then there 's that poor little cretur, Sarah, I love her I 'm sure, but then she's no comfort to me. Sammy, he's a wild little chap, and never thinks to help me, but keeps me in a fret like all the time. Now Johnny, that's gone, he was a thoughtful little boy, always ready to do mother a good turn; and only think, Mr. Howe, the day afore he took sick, he said to me, ' When I 'm a man, mother, see if you'll have to work as you do now!' O dear, dear, what shall I do! Then there was my baby - but no, Mr. Howe, I can't talk to you about her; you would n't understand how I felt about her. Miss Howe could a little, but not all. She was my comfort always." And the poor woman broke down and sobbed so vio- lently, that it was long before she could listen to Mr.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       209 Howe's kind Christian words. He tried to soothe her, and after offering a short but earnest prayer that her sorrows might be comforted, he left her, saying: "Mrs. Howe would have long since been down to see you, but that she was sick abed herself, and had been since--" here his voice trembled, and he added, " for two weeks." "O dear, I'm a dreadful selfish woman, I know, sir, never to have thought of your trouble. Did it bring Miss Howe down so bad as that . " "She was not well previously, and the care and anxiety were too much for her, I, fear," replied Mr. Howe. -"We all have our sorrows, Mrs. Green, and to have them do us good, we must try and bear them in a right manner; but I know it is hard, for if the spirit is willing, truly the flesh is weak." His next visit was to Mrs. Norton; and when he told her of Mrs. Green's state of mind, she at once said she would go to see her. "Perhaps I can comfort her," she added, with tearful eyes. "I ought to be able to, I am sure." But Mrs. Green, from the accumulation of her griefs, was in that perverse state of mind which refuses all consolation, and only hugs closer to itself its sorrows and trials. So in answer to some kind, consolatory re- mark of Delia's, she answered, almost angrily: "It 's very easy for you to talk so, Miss Norton; you, who have so much to make you happy, so many to look to for comfort; if you was in my place, I expect you'd find some troubles was worse than others." "I did not intend, Mrs. Green, to compare our suffer- ings, for I can see how heavy yours are for you to bear; only I thought if you would look upon the causes of thankfulness you have, that your children are removed to a better world, you would feel differently. We shall 18    210      HERE AND HEREAFTER: never get any comfort, I am afraid, if we think only of our loss, not of our children's gain." "You that have so many comforts can- afford to talk and feel so," again reiterated the woman, in a sullen tone, " but I've lost all my comfort in life in them two children. Look here, Miss Norton, you're a mother, and I don't doubt loved your children; perhaps I can make you understand how I feel about this thing. I  thought I could n't Mr. Howe, though he's a tender- hearted man, and a good one, too. Well, now you see," said she, fixing her dark eyes full upon Delia, and mak- ing an effort, apparently, to say what was on her mind, "my three children that's left is no great satisfaction to me. I don't wish to talk about 'em, but they aint, X and my husband - well, all the town knows what he is. Now Johnny, you know what he was, 'cause you spoke about him to me long ago, and said you would give him work in your garden all the spare time he had out of school, and I 'm sure you was very good in that, and I haint forgot it. As I was saying, Johnny was a real good boy; and now, do you think it's nateral for me to be a thinking he's better off in heaven? No, no! it's nat- eral for me to think how good he was to me, and how happy he was, too, little as he had to make him so. Don't you see, Miss Norton?" "I see that his death is a very great loss to you, and that it is only through faith in God that you can be rec- onciled to it. If we have that, Mrs. Green, believe me, it removes mountains of difficulty." u' Well, I haint got that yet, I s'pose, for I'don't feel reconciled anyhow. Now, Miss Norton, let me tell you about my baby, my little Lucy Jane, if I can," she said, trying to choke down her emotion. "I dare say you thought she was such a little puny, sickly thing, that I'd soon get over her loss."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      2" "No, I have always been told that the more care a child requires, the more love it calls forth in a moth- er's heart, and I can readily understand why it should be so." "I 'm glad you think so. Now p'raps you can under- stand me, though somehow, Miss Norton, I loved that baby so much, it don't seem as if I could ever tell any- body how much. First, you see, she was sickly, and for a year it never seemed as if she 'd live from one week to another. Then she got better; and a brighter little thing than 'she was, I never see,--playful as a kitten, and so loving. O dear, she kept me out of wicked thoughts with her little innocent ways. Why, when I waked up nights and felt that dreadful load at my heart, we poor folks so seldom wake up without, I'd feel after that dear little cretur's soft hand, and if I got hold of that, my heart grew light at once; and then when mornings she used to wake up and put her little arms close round my neck and hug me, and pat my cheeks and try to say, ma; somehow it cheered me up for the day. Then no matter how hard my work was, if father was cross, Ann saucy, and Sammy rude, if ever I could spare a minute from my work and took her up, that would comfort me, and I 'd feel better and not mind things so much.' I don't know but she seemed a little puny thing to other folks, Miss Norton, but she was an angel to me, and kept me out of a deal of bad thoughts, and deeds, too; for I never could raise my hand to shake Ann or strike Sammy, when she was looking at me with those eyes of hers, that never seemed to belong to this wicked world. And now to think that I shall never, never see them eyes again, never hear her sweet voice again,-never! O, hardest of all, never feel them dear arms around my neck, or that little soft cheek   212      HERE AND HEREAFTER: laid against mine; O dear, can I bear it?- -can I bear it and live?" Again Mrs. Norton attempted to say a few words, to direct her to the only Comforter, although she was so much affected by her grief, as well as by the remem- brance of her own freshy bleeding wounds, that she could not say much. But it seemed as if the poor wo- mall was almost beside herself, for she said almost angrily: "Yes, yes, it's easy for you rich, who are clothed in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day, to preach comfort to us poor miserable crea- tures, whose lot in life is so wretched; it is easy for you to say, give up your one little lamb, and be happy; you who have flocks and herds, and houses and lands; it's easy to say it. But all you can say will not give me back my child, or keep me out of evil, as one touch of her little hand could do." "Is it possible, Mrs. Green," said Mrs. Norton, "when you remember the love you bore those dear ones whom God has taken home in his never-failing mercy, is it possible that you can think for one instant that wealth and ease, houses and lands, afford any comfort for such a loss? Do you suppose my surroundings are sources of consolation to my poor sorrow-stricken heart? Would you have given up those children, could you by so doing have been at once placed in ease and luxury? Could you have done it? If you could not, at least consider that my child was as dear to me as yours were to you, and that no outward circumstances of prosperity can, in any measure, console me for his loss. O no, Mrs. Green. Had I no other source of comfort, cheer- less indeed should I be. To all, rich and poor,- high and low. alike, God has given but one fountain of heal- ing,--faith in him; a faith which enables the heart to   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       213 feel, while the lips express, ' Thy will, not mine, O Lord, be done!'"  "May be so, Miss Norton, may be. If it's wicked, I can't help it; but I can't think of nothing but that the Lord has taken all my comforts away from me, while you have many left." "It is wicked, Mrs. Green, for you to refuse consola- tion so pertinaciously. It is unkind, at least, to dwell entirely upon your own sorrows, and shut your eyes to those of your neighbors," said Miss Ellis, who had en- tered the outer room unperceived, and had heard most of the conversation, and not without tears, too, at the poor woman's pathetic account of the saving angel the baby had been to her. "Mrs. Norton, who has left her own home of mourning to comfort you, deserved better treatment at your hands. But I don't ask you to contrast your lot with hers. Look at your neighbors and friends; look at Mrs. Deane, whose husband has been taken from  her; and she a poor sickly woman, left with five little children, two of them babies, and a bedridden mother; look at Mrs. Hart, who has lost her only son, as fine and promising a lad as you ever saw, and upon whom the family depended, now that the hus- band and father is far gone in consumption. Your loss is great, but if you viewed it in the right spirit, in- stead of selfishy mourning over it, you would strive to rejoice that those dear ones are safe in their Father's kingdom; safe from all the trials and hardships of the lot they would have had in this world, safe from  the snares of sin. Would you wish those children to live on year after year to suffer, rather than accept for them what yoir Heavenly Father has ordained? Are you not rebellious and ungrateful?" "O Miss Ellis, spare the poor woman, I beseech you,"   214      HERE AND HEREAFTER: said Mrs. Norton. "You do not know how much she suffers." "No, no, I don't deserve to be spared," answered the humbled sufferer. "I 've been more wicked than I 've said, and I 've been awfully selfish too ; but your words, though sharp to hear, Miss Ellis, will do me good. I 've had a many mercies after all, and I 've been cared for as well as if I 'd been a better woman. And Ann is better, too, since she took to going to your house, Miss Ellis, and the children died; and p'raps they 'll all do better now; Jack has so far, though I 've done nothing to cheer him up either. If there was anybody he loved, it was Johnny." '"Take heart, then, my good woman," said Miss Ellis, her severity of manner changed into one of the utmost tenderness; " try to win back your husband, be patient and loving to Sammy and Ann, and we will do all we can to help you. We know your trials are heavy and hard to bear; we only wish you to see a Father's hand in them, and we are certain you will be comforted." So saying, Miss Ellis rose to go, and Mrs. Norton went out with her, both of them pressing the afflicted mother's hand with that magnetic touch that comes from the heart, which she returned with a grateful look, speaking more eloquently than words could have done. At the gateway of the little yard they found Ann crouched down over a book, and Sammy playing in a little pond by the roadside. ' Good morning, Ann," said Miss Ellis, pleasantly. "Do you like your book?" "Reckon I do, first rate," answered the girl, looking up with a grin. t"Well, after you have finished that chapter, suppose you go in and help your mother awhile?"   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       215 "La, I 'd as lief as not; but she never thinks I know nothin'." "Well, try to convince her that you do; she has a heavy trouble to bear, you know, and now that you are so stout and large, you ought to do a good deal." 4 If you would like, you and Sammy, to get some fagots for your mother's fire, Ann, and if you will come to me this afternoon, when you can be spared, I will show you where there are some that you may have; and you shall gather some nuts to carry home too, if you like," said Mrs. Norton. "La sakes, should n't I like it, and Sammy too?- Reckon we 'll come, Miss Norton." The ladies passed on, and presently Miss Ellis said: "You must not think me an unkind woman, Mrs. Nor- ton, that I spoke as I did to poor Mrs. Green. She was in just that state that you might have talked with her for ever in gentle, persuasive language, without effect. It required a few sharp words to set the matter before her in its true light at once. It was a severe effort for me to speak as I did, but I saw it was needed. I do think she has a very hard time of it, and at best Ann will not be much service or comfort to her." "She was not far from right either, in some things that she said," answered Mrs. Norton. "Trial must be harder to bear where there is no light to balance the shade. Such a life of hopeless toil must add to her griefs." "I don't know about that. The very necessity she is under to labor prevents her from dwelling all the time on her griefs. I believe in labor, hard labor, too; it is beneficial both to soul and body. But I don't be- lieve in a miserable drunken man, iwho makes a brute of himself, and a slave of his household. That is Mrs. Green's real trouble. It is that which- paralyzes her   216      HERE AND HEREAFTER: energies, sours her temper, and deadens her natural af- fections; for they are deadened towards her most trou- blesome children. I think Mrs. Green had, originally, an average good disposition and kind feelings." "Miss Ellis," interposed Mrs. Norton, almost abrupt- ly, " something must be done to' give employment to the children of this neighborhood." "I wish something could be done. They have too much leisure time. I have the most orthodox faith in the old familiar line, ' Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do,' " was the interested reply. '"I have a plan to propose as a temporary expedient, Miss Ellis, but I have not yet consulted Mr. Norton. Since my little  , since I have met with trouble, I think my heart has warmed more than ever towards other motlers, and I feel as if I could do anything to help them in their task of guiding their children aright, or, where they are not themselves capable of that, to teach the children so that they may practically guide their parents. Heaven is so mich more real to me now than ever before, that it seems to me I cannot do too much to induce other mothers to educate their chil- dren with a special view to the great hereafter. Tlhe beautiful gardens of paradise are no longer afar off, with closed gates; no, they are open wide, and angelic forms are beckoning to me to bring all my treasures there, where he  my darling is. And what I am learning day by day to prize more and more for myself, I wish to make a reality to others worth striving for. Those little children must first acquire habits of industry, hon- esty, and truth; then the good ground in their hearts will be ready for the good seed." "Whatever your plan may be, my dear young friend, I trust you will meet with success; and I thank God   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      217 that your bitter trial has not hardened your heart against your suffering fellow-creatures, which it would infallibly have done had you sat down in your dark- ened room, folded your hands, and given way to your sorrow." "I could not hiave done that, Miss Ellis; I don't know but I should have lost my reason if I had; for when he was taken, it seemed that a part of my very life had been rent from me. The only way to stanch the flowing wound appeared to be to try to do for others what I would have done for him. When he first lay in my arms I consecrated him to God, and determined as far as an erring mortal could, to lead him ever in the path of righteousness and truth. Ah, most mysterious is this severing of ties that have such strong hold of us. -Row my heart ached for Mrs. Green when she spoke of the power of her child's voice, look, and touch. Verily, I believe we draw nearer to our Father, when we give ourselves up to the holy influences of innocent ch ild- lood. How restraining, and how subduing, are their sweet tones, their loving glances, and most of all their oft, clasping embrace! I well remember one day when was vexed with Felice, and must have shown it in my ook and tone, my little Georgie came up behind me and ut his soft white arms around amy neck, and, clasping is little dimpled hands together, held me thus a mo- ient. That innocent embrace, although he spoke no rord, and I could not see the expression of his face t once exorcised the evil spirit. Truly, little children re God's teachers to us, if we will but heed their les- The two ladies now separated.  As Miss Ellis, whose arm sympathies and kindly feelings were interested r  Mrs. Norton, pursued her way alone, she thought 19!   218       HERE AND HEREAFTER: how a superficial judgment would have pronounced such a person as she was too good to need discipline, and here was already springing up in her heart, as one of the results of the trial with which she had been visited, an increased interest in her fellow-beings, especially in the poor and unfortunate and vicious. Mrs. Norton's plan, which met the entire approbation of her husband, and had his co-operation, was this. Beside the cleared grounds at Rosedale, near the house, were several acres mostly covered with wood. In some parts the underbrush had been cut up and laid to- gether in piles. She proposed that the children of the poor people should be hired at a certain sum a bundle to tie this brush into neat fagots, and to have the privilege also of carrying home a certain percentage of their labor, and of gathering nuts on the premises one afternoon in the week. She took upon herself to go out into the wood towards the close of every afternoon, to inspect the work, and give directions for the next day, and have a general oversight of what was done.' At the end of each week they were to receive their wages. Children dearly love out-door employment, and their labor was so light and pleasant, that at the end of the first week they all- said it was the best fun in the world; that they 'd do their fagots as nice as they could to get a smile from the pale lady in black, who was so good to them, and never spoke a cross word. When they re- ceived their first week's pay, their eyes sparkled, and their faces shone with the delight of successful effort; and when Mrs. Norton told them if they continued to work well, at the end of a month they should have an afternoon's recreation on the grounds, and a feast be- side, they could hardly restrain their joy. Of the workers, no one was more active or more am-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      219 bitious to have a good many bundles of fagots in neat order, than Sammy Green. His mother said he had n't any time for mischief now. Ann, was not quite so in- dustrious as her brother, but still she worked more in the wood and at home than she had everdone before. Miss Ellis said to her mother, significantly: ," Courage and patience, Mrs. Green; Ann will be a good girl yet." So the experiment worked well for the projector, the laborers, and their parents.   220      HERE- AND HEREAFTER: C CHAPTER XX. "No act falls fruitless ; none can tell How vast its power may be; Nor what results infolded dwell Within it, silently." - LONDON INQUIRER. To return to Ann Green. When she came to Elm Hill she had made herself so neat, and her face bore an expression so much pleasanter than usual, that Miss Ellis received her quite cordially, and after talking with her for a few minutes, called to Annie to take her up stairs to a book-case, which contained some of Miss Edgeworth's tales and other stories, which she thought would interest her. No sooner were the girls alone, than Ann, fixing her large black eyes full upon Annie, said: "Do you like it?" "Like what?" asked the other. "Why, living here shut up in a house, and having to study and sew? I should n't." "I 'm not shut up in the house, Ann," was the smil- ing reply, " and I do like to study and sew." '"La now, that's cur'ous. I don't like to do nothin', and don't see the good of it either. Marm works and works all for nothin'; nobody thanks her, and I 'm sure we have a dull time enough of it at home." '"But what would you do if your mother did not work? You would starve." "Reckon not; there's the poor-huLss." "You don't mean you would like to live there?" "Shouldn't care where I lived, if I did nl't have to   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       221 work. Don't see no good in it. Once, when I was lit- tle, I used to like to help do chores and things, but dad was ugly and swore at me ; kicked me once; and marm, she was cross, and used to shake me. 'Tween kickin' and shakin', reckon it got all the work out of me." "You are older now- Ann, and know more of your mother's troubles; do try to help her." "La, what do you care? It can't make no difference to you." "Yes it does; and it will make more difference to you than you think. Some day, when you are older and wiser, you 'll be sorry you did n't do more to help your parents. You can't tell how sorry." "Reckon I shan't. Don't see how you know." I know," said Annie, in a firm but sad voice, " be- cause when I was a child I did n't always do as I ought for my mother, or my father either; and now that they are gone, it makes me very sad to think of it." " That 's queer. I never feel sorry for nothin' that I do. Wonder what makes folks so different?" - "'You don't feel sorry because you don't know or think what you are doing ; some day you will, and then, I tell you again, I 'm sure you 'll be sorry." "Did you have a good time when you were little? If you did, you don't know nothin' about my home." "No, Ann, I did n't. I had no more pleasures than you, no more comforts, no more luxuries, no more sources of happiness. I had great trials, but for the most part I tried to do my duty; where I failed to do it is my greatest trouble now. I had so sad a lot in my childhood, Ann, that I feel for yours very munch. I should be glad to assist you. I will teach you any- thing I can, and will try to make it pleasant to you to learn; won't you let me?" 19*   222      HERE AND HEREAFTER: And the fair young girl laid her soft white hand upon Ann's coarse dirty one. She looked up with as- tonishment, and then, in a tone almost like a cry, said, withdrawing her hand as she spoke: "Don't, don't, you make me feel so; most as if I wanted to cry, and I haint cried I don't b'leive since dad kicked me." "But you will let me teach you? Once I knew very little, and Mrs. Norton let me come to her to study and recite; if I could do as much for you, I should be very glad." Well, p'raps I 'll come; but," resuming her old look of obstinate defiance, " don't you go to makin' bargains with me. If you don't want to learn me for nothin', you need n't, I don't care; but I aint a going to be made or bargained into workin' at home. If I 've a mind to work, I 'll work; if I haint, I won't." "I don't wish to bargain with you, Ann; you can do as you please. I will consult Miss Ellis, and will come down to-morrow to tell you what hours I can best spare for you." "You won't, will you?" "Yes I will, surely." "I 'd like that. Marm thinks I aint no account to nobody. Reckon she'll be astonished when she sees what you're arter. May I take this book? I'm tired- stayin' in the house." In a few minutes more she was tearing down the avenue of Elm Hill with all her speed; and as Miss Ellis and Annie watched her progress, the former re- marked: "A wild creature that for you to tame, my dear. Do you think it best to persevere in your under- taking?" ' If you are willing; I should like to do some good to some one, and I believe I have an influence over   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      223 her; and I think I see how she has become the girl she is." "She will tax your patience more than you imagine. I would n't be by, for a good deal, at her lessons." But Annie Clarke had been taught in a good school for the exercise of patience; for that was a quality which her brother, in his wayward selfishness, had pretty thor- oughly tried. So she succeeded admirably with her unpromising pupil. Occasionally, to be sure, her fair brow would contract slightly, or she would utter an ih- voluntary O, as Ann either galloped over her words with a sublime indifference to sense and sound, or spoke in a voice so thick and indistinct that only her throat could possibly have been the wiser for what she said; or again, if the sullen mood was upon her, spell out her reading with a slowness and stupidity requiring no small amount of self-control calmly to listen to. She came to her lessons four times a week quite punctually to the hour, and at the end of the month had made marked improvement in reading, spelling, and arithmetic, could hem quite tolerably, and was a little more civilized in her manners. In the meantime she had made herself of some service at home, although her duties there were performed with the capriciousness to have been expected from her disposition and character. Her admiration for Annie Clarke was unbounded, which she sometimes ex- pressed in the most undisguised terms. One day, after an unusually free utterance of her opinion of her youth- ful teacher, the latter said: "I wish you would n't talk so to me, Ann; I don't like to hear you." "La, now, you don't?  Why, you must know you are as pretty as you can be, and I should think you 'd like to have folks tell you so. I should." "I should n't suppose you would, Ann."   224      HERE AND HEREAFTER; "Should n't! Why not?" "Because you are very good looking yourself, -if you would only take care of your person,- be neat and  " "Well, and what? I can bear it from you; you aint like most folks, --they makes me mad with their ad- ice, they're so sot up." "So what, Ann?" "Sot up; jest like as if they said to me, ' An Green, you dirty, bad girl, hear what we say to you, we who- are so nice and handsome and good. You are a dread- ful wicked child, a great slut, and a sarcy thing, too. Larn to be good and clever as we are; then you may come and clean our shoes.'" "Ann, Ann!" "O, you need n't try to make me think it is n't so,- all but Miss Norton, I mean Mrs. Norton, and p'raps Miss Ellis, only she has a kinder orderin' way with her I don't like. Now you aint a bit so. You seems as if you wanted to ax my pardon for bein' so different from me, and that's why I almost worships you, and mean to try and do as you wants. So now tell, and what? I say I can bear it from you." Annie laughed at her pupil's novel idea, and said, pleasantly: "My and is, if you will endeavor to culti- vate your better feelings, Ann, and let them shine out through your face." "Don't know exactly what you mean; don't- see what difference it makes." " Did you ever see Linden Brook, near Silver Lake, Ann, after a storm, when it was muddy and dark col- ored?" "Reckon I have, many a time; but I don't think it's pretty thfen.'-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       225 "Not so pretty as when, clear and smooth and spark- ling, it flows peacefully on, reflecting all beautiful objects on its calm surface." "No, not by a great sight." "Well, Ann, your face is something like that brook; when you don't feel kind or good, it is muddy and un, pleasant to look upon; when you do, it is as pleasing to the beholder as the clear calm water." "Well, now, that's odd enough to think my face should be like anything so pretty as that when I feel good. I'd like to be good lookin' at least, and p'raps I 'll try to be neater and pleasanter. That's what it means, I s'pose, by 'handsome is that handsome does'?" "Yes, Ann." "Well, now, this is the- first time I ever heard I was anything but bold and sarcy looking. Reckon it does folks good sometimes to let 'em know they aint all ugli- ness outside and in too. I 've heard so much of that story, I believed it, so \I did n't care. But I will tell you something Miss Annie; I never was happy all the time.  Now sometimes I do feel light as a cork some- how, and as if this was a beautiful world arter all. But I declare I never did think I was anyhow decent lookin' afore; but if you say so, it must be true." And Ann Green took her departure homeward that day with a new feeling in her heart. It at least began to dawn upon her mind, that it rested with herself, in a -good measure, whether she was to be liked and respect- ed or not. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he "; and if a child is constantly reproached with his faults, and is hearing from  every one how wicked he is, he is very likely to come to think himself as bad as he is said to be, and to grow up in the character ascribed to him. Kicked and abused by her father, shaken and fretted at   226      HERE AND HEREAFTER: by her mother, with the continual chorus of her ugli- ness and sauciness and disobedience ringing in her ears, Ann Green had thus far justified the judgments which had been passed upon her. What revolutions the new influences under wlich she has come will work in her character remains to be seen. In the short period that has elapsed since her first visit to Elm Hill and Rose- dale, she has evidently changed for the better in several particulars. When the fitting time comes, Annie in- tends to ask her to go to the Sunday School to become a pupil in her class; but she still finds it necessary to move with caution, fearing lest she may lose the hold she now has upon her. When Annie related to Miss Ellis the above conversa- tion, she added, with a grateful, beaming countenance: "I almost feel as if I was returning in some degree the good I received from Mrs. Norton, as she said I could." "Yes, child, time may not reveal the blessed results proceeding from that one good act of Mrs. Norton; for they will extend far beyond our little day. Eternity will declare them, however. She did for my little vis- ionist what I, in my practical, every-day ways, could never have accomplished; and what she and you do for Ann Green, for I confess she is quite beyond the pale of my impatient influence, no mortal will ever be able to measure the ending thereof. She is one of those char- acters whose influence in her class will be positive for good or for evil. I believe, young as you are, Annie, God has given you power to incline the balance on the side of right."   UGk THE TWO ALTARS.        227 CHAPTER XXI. "For youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears, Than settled age his fables, and his weeds Importing health and graveness." - SHAKESPEARE. AT the expiration of the month, when the children were to have their afternoon's recreation and festival in the grounds of Rosedale, it was found that they had really accomplished a great deal of work, and had done good service in clearing the wood nearest the garden. One spot in particular, where lofty walnut-trees formed a beautiful shade in summer, and which had been se- lected for the tables, in case the day should prove pro- pitious, they had labored upon with great zeal, and freed it not only of branches of trees, but also of loose stones, so as to make it pleasant for walking or sitting. Nature smiled upon them, and that November day was not "chill and drear," but gladdened by the soft Indian Summer, who in her retreat to other climes seemed to pause and throw her mantle over the earth for the oc- casion. As the days were short, the hour of assembling was two o'clock, and refreshments were to be served at four. Miss Ellis and Annie Clarke were early on the grounds, and were soon after joined by Howard and Duncan Leslie, as aids. Mr. and Mrs. Norton and Felice arrived soon after. Mr. Norton called the children around him and conm-   Zi3o -    HERE AND HEREAFTER: mended them for the activity and neatness with which they had done their work, and endeavored to impress upon their minds, that labor was not only honorable, but also a pleasure, when it is performed in a cheerful, happy spirit. He illustrated his remarks with short stories, to which the greater part of his young audi- tors listened with evident gratification. Before he got through, however, some of them began to grow restless. About the time Mr. Norton had come to what he con- sidered the most important part of his discourse, and was pointing out how the love of the All Father was shown in his works, and the sources of enjoyment open to all his intelligent children, Ann Green, who appeared to be in most exuberant spirits, slily got hold of the long flaxen curl of a little boy, and dexterously fastened it to the branch of a tree, against which he was leaning, with eyes and mouth opened, apparently listening with all his senses to the speaker. Felice, who was some distance off, happened to see the manoeuvre, and ran quickly but quietly round to the mischievous girl and lwhispered to her in, a voice of suppressed passion: "Unloose that this instant, or I will." "I sha'n't. Get out; do n't you come here to spile my fun." "I will, then," said the determined child. Just then the curly-headed little fellow suddenly moved forward to keep in view Mr. Norton, who had changed his position. Held back as he was-in this unexpected way, and frightened out of the proprieties of the place by the pain, he cried out with a prolonged O-o-o-o! not a little startling to hear. Mr. Norton turned to see Felice, with rage depicted in every feature of her face and uplifted hand, menacing Ann Green, who, in a convulsion of laughter, was trying to release the little boy.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       229 "Felice! Felice! what does this mean?" asked Mr.  Norton, in that terribly stern tone he had when justly incensed. "Come here and tell me about it." A general hubbub now arose, and every one was in- quiring the cause of such an interruption, while the innocent little curly-head continued to cry on, in a low, piteous whine, from mortification more than from suf- fering. 'Shame! shame!" said some; "just like that ugly Ann Green,-- always plaguin' somebody." "Dreadful sight of good she's got going to take lessons at great folks' houses," said others. Better mend her manners as well as her clothes," said others still. While some, in whom the spirit of fun, not always innocent, was predominant, said: "My, how he did holler! he, he, he!" Guess his marm didn't know he was out with his tow head." "Dan's pride had to take it that time." "Tim White says his marm curls them ere up every night of her life; better darn his trousers." Meantime, Mr. Norton having ascertained from Fe- lice her share in the transaction, stooped down and said to her gently: "You were right, Felice, in wishing to prevent that mischief, but you should have told Mamma Delia, if you could not restrain your temper. I am afraid all I can say will make very little impres- sion, if one of my children manifests such a spirit as you have done. You had better go and sit by yourself a little while, until you are sure you are calm and sorry." "I am both, now, Uncle Leslie, but I will go; I de- serve to. I meant to be so good." "Poor child, it is hard to punish her for an error oil virtue's side! but her temper needs to be subdued at whatever cost to her friends or herself," said Mr. 20   230      HERE AND HEREAFTER: Norton to himself, as she left him for a distant and soli- tary part of the wood, where he could just see her little erect figure sitting upon an old stump. His stern rebuke to Ann Green was received by her in her most lawless manner. "La sakes, I did n't mean nothin' but fun. Dan 's such a baby, he 'd cry if you winked at him." "Then you should n't wink at him. Mrs. Norton invited you all here, Ans, to be merry and happy, and not to spoil each other's pleasure by mischievous tricks. You should remember always the golden rule. Do you know it?" "Reckon I do. Miss Annie 's learned it to me afore this; but I don't rightly know which is which; some on em 's gold, and some on em's silver. If you 'll tell me this 'ne, I 'll try and remember it next time." ' IWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.' " "Same as do as you'd be done by, for short, aint it?" "The same." "Well, I 'll try and remember it. But you see, Mr. Norton, I did n't really mean no harm, nohow, only I'm kinder full of mischief, and his curl got cotched so handy in that branch, it kinder tempted me to fasten it. But I'm sorry, I declare I be. I meant to be good for Miss Annie's sake. La now," she said, opening her eyes wide, and with a change in her manner, " if that aint the beautifullest younlg gentleman I ever seed. Who is he, Mr. Norton?" pointing, as she spoke, to Duncan Leslie. "That's my cousin, Mr. Leslie." "Not Mr. Howard? I 've seen him afore." "No; his brother." She looked at him earnestly, and then a shade passed   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       231 over her face, for, she continued: "He 's most as good as Miss Annie, I expect; I'd do jest what he told me to, I reckon." ' If you like so much what is good, Ann, why are you not better yourself?" "'Spict I wa'n't made so; don't know; but I am a deal better than I was. Ask Miss Annie.   I am, if I ,did that mischief, anyhow." And she nodded so complacently and vigorously, that Mr. Norton turned away to conceal a smile. After the children had enjoyed themselves in the va- rious sports suited to their age to their hearts' content, they were summoned to the tables, to partake of the re- freshment provided  for them. The rush and clamor were great, and it was some time before Howard Leslie, who held, as he said, the responsible office of master of ceremonies, could reduce them to order, and keep them within proper bounds while' Mr. Howe  invoked the Di- vine blessing upon them.  For some minutes, everything went on pleasantly and  amicably. Felice showed her repentance for her outhurst of temper by waiting on Ann Green with especial assiduity. Presently, however, a  commotion arose at one end of the tables, and two stout boys, twelve or thirteen years of age, were seen grappling with each other as if with the purpose of a regular ," set-to." "It 's mine, Bill! I say I 'll have it!" cried one. "Taint yourn," was the reply. 'I got hold on it first. Ax that little black-eyed gal," meaning Felice, ' if I did n't." "'Anyhow, I 've got it, and I  'll keep it, and help yourself if you can, Bill. Git out of that, Sam Green. You better mind how you meddle with what's none of your business," turning to the latter as lie pulled   232      HERE AND HEREAFTER: vigorously at his jacket, determined to take the part of the weaker of the two. But Sam did not " get out of that," but persevered in his efforts, while the boy, by the administration of kicks and blows, right and left, upon both of his assail- ants, proved his ability to do good service in the kind of warfare in which he was engaged, until Mr. Norton's, hand was laid heavily upon his shoulder, and lhe was ordered to desist. "You have disgraced yourself and us," said Mr. Nor- ton. "Either leave the grounds at once, or go yonder and sit down until you are served." "I got it fust. 'T was my cake. Joe's a sneak, a mean, driv-" "Silence, sir, and do as you are told, at once," was the answer, in a tone which admitted of no further parley. And the boy, unwilling to lose the feast, and cowing before superior strength, went doggedly to the seat pointed out. Other manifestations there were of greediness, self- ishness, and rudeness, not more -gratifying to witness. But on the whole, and considering what the habits of the children had been, and how they had been brought up, they behaved pretty well. One little curly-haired fellow, a young Apollo in beauty, came and pulled Mrs. Norton's dress, and said, in baby lisp, (he was not three years old,) "Me wants to kiss ou." A request which she readily granted. In looking down upon him, something in his tone and the- glance of his full dark eye reminded her so strongly of her lost one, that a tear came with the kiss. "Don't, please don't ky," said the child, wonderingly. "Have you had a good time, my dear little-fellow?" asked Mrs. Norton, forcing back her tears.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       238 "Yes, yes, so dood. May me come adin?" "Some time, perhaps." "Me tell marm, one more kiss."   And he ran off to his sister, who had been watching the scene with some alarm at his freedom. "What did you ask the lady to kiss you for, larry?" she inquired. "'Cause she look sorry, like marm. Me want to make her glad." He had witnessed the charm his caresses had over his mother, and in the fulness of his loving heart he wished to give comfort where he saw it was needed. His mother had been bereaved by the late epidemic, and with the quick observation of childhood he perceived that Mrs.- Norton had been a sufferer in the same way.    I What remained upon the tables, after all had boun- tifully partaken that afternoon, was gathered up and put into bags, and given to the children to carry home. Thus laden, and striking up a lively march, they were marshalled to the road by Howard Leslie, who then dis- missed them, and returned to the grounds to assist in what was to be done there. He had not proceeded far, before he met Annie Clarke, leaning upon Duncan's arm, pale, and walking with difficulty.  Before his lips framed the words 'What's the   matter?" his eyes met his brother's, and like an electric flash, each read the other's secret. Immediately, Miss Ellis came hurriedly forward, and esought Howard to hasten to the stable for a low car- iage, saying:  ," Annie has sprained her ankle and can- tot walk, and the air is becoming so chilly I fear she will take cold." The words were scarcely out of her mouth before he as off on his commission. The fever that suddenly 20* I    234      HERE -AND HEREAFTER: raged in his veins, caused by the discovery lhe had just made, impelled him onward. By the time he returned to say the carriage was ready, he was calm again. But not so with Duncan; his face was flushed and wore: a remorseful expression, as if he had been guilty of some mortal offence; and when Miss Ellis said, "Let me take your place, Duncan, Howard will assist me in getting Annie home," he made no objection, but, mechanically releasing her arm from his, made a low bow, and with- out looking back, joined his cousins in a distant part of the wood. When, after all was over, Mrs. Norton returned home, she threw herself into a chair and sighed heavily. "What's the matter?" inquired her husband, in cheerful tones. "I hope you are not discouraged with the results of this afternoon's undertaking, because ev- erything has not gone just to your mind. You can't expect such, or indeed any children, to behave like grown up people; even our little Felice did not; and surely we 're not discouraged about her." 'a No, Leslie, I am not discouraged, and shall not relax in the least in my efforts. I told them to go on with their work if they liked it, and also that I thought you would find-them employment during the winter months." "How?" "Why, there is a vast quantity of that brushwood still; could not one of the men cart it to the lower barn to be cut and tied into fagots there?" ," Certainly; an excellent idea." ", Until cold weather comes, they can gather out and pile up the stones, where the brush is taken away." "Excellent again."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       235 "I think, Leslie, with some management that wood, or a portion of it, can give employment to the poor chil- dren of the village for years. After the ground is cleared, it might be laid out in garden plats for them to cultivate." "A vast deal can be done with a little management, without any doubt. You shall have my good-will and my aid; I will see that your plans are carried out, but tlhe planning must all be yours. I have much to do, to look after my young men, you know. I don't want any more James Clarke's among them, if I can help it. But why do you look so depressed, my love, if you are satis- fied with the result of this afternoon's experiment?" "I did not say I was satisfied; only that I was not discouraged. There is a wide difference between the two. Beside the outhreaks which you suppressed, I saw a great many minor acts which pained me,--acts of un- kindness and selfishness and quarrelling and bickerings, &c. It is a hard work I have undertaken, and I don't know what the end will be." ' Yes, certainly; but that will not deter you from persevering. The best of children, on account of their quick, ardent, impulsive natures, are always erring and always repenting; as, indeed, are not we, who are chil- dren of a larger growth? I need not say courage to a heart so brave as yours, Delia. But you have not told me all." "O Leslie,-am I wicked? Those bright, joyous faces of the little ones, Harry Lewis in particular, so brought our darling before me, that my heart rebelled because he was lying cold and mouldering in his dark grave,  while they and we were there sporting in the bright sunshine."' "But Ihis immortal spirit, dearest, lieth not in the   236      HERE AND HEREAFTER: cold, dark grave. With us to-day was some contention, some strife; where he is, 'There happier bowers than Eden's bloom, Nor sin nor sorrow know.' We had but the light of the sun shining on a world, though beautiful, filled with decay and death; where he is, 'The glory of the Lord God-is the sun and the light thereof.'" "I know it, Leslie, I know it. Such is my faith; but there are times when my heart yearns over that little grave as if it contained all of my little one, soul and body." "Yes, I understand it all. I have such feelings, too, at times. It is so hard to give up dust to dust the pre- cious casket which contained such a priceless jewel. But to realize that the jewel is there no longer, - not rifled by death's cruel hand, but taken in love by our Father,- that, sometimes, is almost too much for my wavering faith. I feared this day's trial would be too much for you, my dear." "It has not been, Leslie; I am glad I went. If I had not, I should have felt that I had put my hand to the plough and looked back. I could form a better idea of the good not done but begun by a holiday than in working hours. And on the whole, I think I am con- tent with the results; as for my griefs, you know, Les- lie, that a mother's heart must overflow sometimes; it is an unspeakable relief to the pent-up fountain. Ah, my pet," and she extended her hands to her baby, who was brought to her, " we are each other's comfort, ar' n't we-? And with little Helen clasped in her arms, singing to her in a low, sweet voice, one of the melodies Georgie   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      237 had loved so well, the mother's tears were dried, and the sweet if sad expression which had of late marked her countenance returned to it, and she was again at peace. The troubled fountain had been stilled, as of old, by the power of Divine love.   238      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXII. "But he who stems a stream with sand, And fetters flame with flaxen band, Has yet a harder task to prove, - By firm Resolve to conquer Love." - SIR W. SCOTT. WHEN Duncan Leslie joined his cousins after the incident related in the last chapter, he announced his intention of returning home at once, instead of remain- ing over night as he had proposed doing, giving as a reason, that he was suffering from an attack of nervous headache, to which he was subject; and requested them to inform Howard of the cause of his abrupt departure. His friends knew that he always preferred being at home during such ill turns, and used no .persuasions to induce him to change his purpose. Had not Delia Norton just then been occupied with her own sorrows, she would not have failed to perceive that something more than physical pain ailed her cousin. But as it was, she remained still ignorant of the new emotions which had been awakened in his heart. In the solitude of his own room at home the con- scientious and thoughtful young man had ample leisure to reflect upon his present position. "He to become his brother's rival," he thought, " that brother who had always been so kind to him and so considerate for his happiness. No, he could not. It must not be. Re- nunciation had been the lesson and the discipline of his life; it was to continue to be so, perhaps to the end." None of his early hopes or dreams had ever been real-   ORj THE TWO ALTARS.      239 ized. One by one he had been obliged to cast them at his feet in obedience to a higher power than his own. With his prospects in life, however, he had learned to be content, and more than content since he had first met Annie Clarke. Their acquaintance dated from the fair at N . So much sympathy had he found in her gentle, imaginative nature, that in his own poet heart he had gone on indulging in a dream of future bliss, in which she was ever the guiding star. He had known of Howard's acquaintance with her, but had never thought of his having formed an attachment, because he had always spoken of her in his sporting, laughing way, calling her "his divinity," , Annie the peerless," "his bright, particular star," &c.; and when he had seen them together, their intercourse had in it nothing of what he fancied took place between lovers. For so reverently did he regard her, that he did not suppose that any one entertaining the same kind of in- terest for her could, for a moment, speak in such a jest- ing manner.  But that look of his brother's, - a look -such as he had never seen upon his bright, handsome face before, - to him had but one meaning; and yet as he dwelt upon it, he could scarcely define it. But, de- finable or not, it left the conviction on his mind that Howard loved Annie Clarke, and he was his brother's rival. As he dwelt almost in dismay on this discovery, his thoughts reverted back to his childhood. He recalled his own feeble condition for so many years, and his brother's lot, which had ever been one of uninterrupted health and buoyancy of spirit; and as he remembered the contrast in their early days and then considered the present, he murmured in bitterness of soul, Whoso- ever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath /    240       HEREN AND HEREAFTER: not, from him shall be taken even that which he seem- eth to have." Then for a season raged one of those con- tests every Christian is obliged at times to experience, when desire and duty, when selfishness and self-sacrifice, are battling for the mastery. "Is it right, is it just," lie asked himself, "for Howard to have everything,- strength, manliness, gladness, and, greatest boon of all, Annie Clarke's love? Shall I give up this dream of years without a struggle? Shall I not make some effort for myself?"For himself!"How," thought he, in the humility of his spirit, " can I hope to vie with Howard, even if I wished it? Is not true love unselfish? and if Annie's happiness is dear to me, can I desire a better lot for her than to be my noble brother's bride?" But longer and fiercer was the contest before a de- cision was made, as one always is made at last in such  hours; and that decision was, to endeavor to do what was right, and patiently abide the issue By a much shorter process, but one of intense suffer- ing while it lasted, Howard Leslie, with his rigid sense of duty where personal considerations were involved, with his tender and disinterested care for his brother, whom he almost felt he wronged by his robust health and high spirits, came to the same conclusion, - of the renunciation of self for his brother's sake. How great a sacrifice it would be he knew not, until the time came for him to make it. True, no word of love had ever passed between him and the object of his affections, but he had been a fre- quent visitor at Elm Hill from his first acquaintance with her, and she had always treated him with kind- ness and seemed to enjoy his society, and he had come to believe that the interest she felt in him would one day ripen into love, if indeed it was not already that, although unconsciously to herself.   OOR, THE TWO ALTARS.       241 It is a singular fact, that in the conflict both brothers passed through it never once occurred to either that it was for Annie to decide after all which of them was to resign his pretensions. As Howard rapidly reviewed the past, he could see no reason- to suppose, in spite of what he may have hoped, that Annie's manner to him expressed less than she ever felt or would feel; while Duncan, always in the habit of regarding his brother's attractions superior to his own, was convinced that he of course would be preferred to himself. Consequently each resolved, out of regard to the other, to endeavor to conquer his attach- ment. Between these two determined self-sacrificers, the prospect was of some suffering to Annie, provided she was interested in either. In the village the matter had been discussed, as such matters always are, but it could not be satisfactorily de- cided which of the two was Amnnie's choice. She had a choice, however, and not as she supposed without a good reason for it; but as it was a subject about which she could not make known her feelings to any one, she kept it closely locked in her own heart, where it must remain at present, a mystery to the partisans of either lover, as well as to the lovers themselves. The innocent girl retired to rest that night with a painful ancle, and a weary frame, but with a glow at her heart; and as she pondered the past, and looked forward to the future, there was no shadow cast on coming events, whichl, for a time at least, were to deprive her in a great degree of the society of both lover and friend. What to her, then, was pain or weariness of body, when she was in that summer land of the en- chanter, Love?-that land where the skies are so bright, the air so soft, the flowers so beautiful, the fruits so 21   242       HERE AND HEREAFTER: golden, -where the earth buoys up the foot, and where the waters sparkle and dance, with no angry winds to ruffle their surface,--where hope beckons on to yet fairer bowers, and heaven seems so near that its gates are opening wide to the vision of the dreamer, who in the fervor of holy, human love, catches a glimmering of the Divine. Into this land had Annie Clarke's feet wandered before she yet knew whither her course tend- ed. So good and lovely a land did it seem to dwell in, with its roseate clouds and nectarian draughts, that she t cared not to retrace her steps. Worn-out roues may sneer at the idea; wise men may bend their sage brows over the problems of science and questions in philosophy, and say that theirs is the only love worthy of intelligent beings; shrewd practi- cal men and matrons may call it silly and sentimental; young men and maidens may make it a jest; but never- theless that land remains, and few are they who, at some period of their lives, do not stray therein and own the enchanter as master. If it be true, as poets have said who seemed to take delight in sombre views of life, the world, and love;-- one, - "O, how this spring of Love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day; Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by and by a cloud takes all away " Another, -- "True he it said, whatever man it sayd, That Love with gall and honey doth abound; But if the one be with the other wayd, For every dram of honey therein found A pound of gall doth over it redound." Another still,-- O O Love! what is it in this world of ours,  Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        243 With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers, And -made thy best interpreter a sigh?" As yet, neither cloud, nor gall, nor cypress wreath over- shadowed the life, embittered the cup, or saddened the brow of Annie Clarke; and in her present mood of un- spoken but sweet thoughts and hopes my readers must leave her, rather than in the more approved novelist's one of doubt, distress, and agony.  !      244      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXIII. "And if she hapt of any good to heare, That had to any happily betid, Then would she inwardly fret and grieve." - SPENSER. PROBABLY no one ever yet undertook a work of be- nevolence, that there were not some persons to cavil at his motives, sneer at his plans, and undervalue his exer- tions. Mr. and Mrs. Norton were no exception to this rule. A few days after the children's festival, Miss Ellis had the honor of a call from Mrs. Grey. With the ardent, matter-of-fact, keenly discerning mistress of Elm Hill, her visitor was no favorite. Indeed, they were as an- tagonistic to each other in thought and deed and aim almost, as if they belonged to different orders of being. "I understand, Miss Ellis," Mrs. Grey began imme- diately, " you were at Mr. Norton's wood the day of the picnic." "I was," Miss Ellis replied, in her curtest tones. Miss Ellis was never so ungracious as when talking with Mrs. Grey. "Queer doings these days, I must say," proceeded the visitor. "Some folks seem to be doing their best to spoil the poor, giving them such high notions and cosset- ing them up as if nothing was too good for them. In my young days, poor folks managed to get along with- out being petted by the rich. Let them work, I say. The Lord made people rich and poor, and I presume he knows what is best better than we."    OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       245 '" Perhaps, Mrs. Grey, if the Lord had not given you the means of providing yourself with a plum-pudding Thanksgiving day, you would n't object to receiving one from a rich neighbor." '"As I am not so situated, Miss E1llis," said Mrs. Grey, drawing herself up, " it is not a supposable case. I think, however, I should always be willing to conform to my circumstances." "Perhaps so; I have heard a great deal of the same talk from people whose bread is always buttered." "That 's neither here nor there, Miss Ellis. I think when rich folks take such freaks as this of Mrs. Nor- ton's, --for I hear it was all her notion, - they better consider a little first if they ar'n't doing more harm than good." " Freaks!" said Miss Ellis, an ominous calmness in her tone. "Yes, I consider them freaks. You mark my word, and see if in a year or two Mrs. Norton don't tire of her excessive goodness, and let those poor people get along -as they can, after she 's raised their notions and made them so overbearing and saucy one can't do anything with them." "We shall see," answered Miss Ellis, not deeming it worth while to enter into an-argument with her visitor. Indeed, she once remarked, that arguing with Mrs. Grey was like casting pearls before swine. "Yes, we shall see; and cool as you take it now, Miss Ellis, you 'll have occasion to recall my words hereafter." "Very possibly," was the laconic -answer. Mrs. Grey, inwardly vexed that Miss Ellis did not at- tempt to refute anything she said, proceeded, knowing the truth all the while : "Of course, Mrs. Norton was not present herself." 21   246      HERE AND HEREAFTER': "I am unable to see the 'of course' of the matter: she was there." "Indeed! Well, that is the strangest thing of all. In my young days, parents showed some little grief when they lost children, and did n't join in feasts and picnics before two months were gone." "Times have changed, doubtless," was the reply. ' Yes, and feelings too. Dear me, I never shall for- get how many weeks it was, after I lost my first child, before ever I went out of the house, except to church, and then in the deepest mourning." "That was your way of expressing your grief, I sup- pose." "Some folks don't seem to express theirs at all. I did think Mrs. Norton had some heart, but she has al- ways been bred in the lap of luxury, and I suppose that deadens the sensibilities." No answer from Miss Ellis; only a vigorous a-hem! She was in her own house, or she would soon have ter- minated the torture she was undergoing. "I know," continued Mrs. Grey, "Mrs. Norton is a great favorite with you, Miss Ellis, and naturally you view these matters with the lenient eye of friendship. I should judge myself that she was a pretty, amiable little person; but she lacks force of character, and is mistaken in her little eccentric defiances of the customs of society. I dare say she would listen to you." "I dare say she would, Mrs. Grey." "I believe I must go now. I hope you have taken all I have said in good part. I hear So many invidious { remarks, I thought it was the part of friendship to tell you." And with a dolorous expression of countenance, the good lady withdrew.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       247 Miss Ellis marshalled her to the door, returned her good morning, then deliberately mounted the stairs, saying as she went, 'u Humph! a-hem! 'Pretty, amiable little person; lacks force of character.' Catch whales with an angler's line; bail out the Atlantic with a pint dipper; Mrs. Grey to presume to understand such a wo- man as Mrs. Norton!"Having thus relieved her mind, she went into her bedchamber, expecting to find Annie Clarke at her sewing; but Annie was not there. She presently answered to the loud calling of her name, however, at her own door, with her hair hanging loosely over her shoulders. "Shall I come, aunt?" she asked. "Yes, yes, child, do come; never mind your hair. I want an antidote. There, give me your hand; and sit down and let me look into your kind, honest face; better that, Annie Clarke, than all your beauty. I feel better now; so you may run and put up your braids. By the way, I believe there 's a wonderful power in the hand; insight into the character in its touch; and the -allaying or exciting of the evil there is in one's heart. Perhaps," she added, " the Sibyls were not so far out of the way in claiming to read one's destiny in his hand." Annie was so accustomed to her kind relative's eccen- tricities, that she asked no explanation of her singular conduct,---as, indeed, having seen Mrs. Grey depart, she needed none. Miss Ellis never made any allusion what- ever to the visit, excepting that day, at the dinner-table, asking her brother, somewhat irrelevantly to the sub- ject of conversation, if he supposed temperament and character had anything to do with diseases of the gall? Hte smiled, and asked the reason of such a singular question. To which she answerede: ' O nothing; only, if such is the case, I am afraid some of my neighbors are in danger of the complaint."   248      HERE AND HEREAFTER: If Miss Ellis herself was happy in the society of her young relative, as well as in the new interests which her residence at Elm Hill had called into existence, she was no less so in the change which evidently was taking place in her silent, melancholy brother. Very gradually was this going on. The cheering presence, the lovely face, and winning manners of Annie Clarke seemed to be dispersing the cloud, which so long had overshadowed his life, as the morning sun dispels the heavy veil of fog enshrouding all nature and casting a gloom, over the landscape. The weight he had borne through so many years seemed to be lifted from his spirit by the daily companionship and influence of this guileless and gentle nature, who truly was to her friend what the life-giving and warmth-imparting orb of day is to the outward world. To the large-hearted sister, Annie supplied that void, which once she dreamed would have been filled by nearer objects of love. To the morbid, joyless imagin- ings of the brother she gave a reality of loveliness and intelligence which possessed a wonderful power in drawing him away from  himself. She afforded him new employments also; for he gave her lessons daily in his sister's room in the languages and mathematics and English literature. When the change first became ap- parent in him, his sister was a good deal troubled lest lis affections should become interested in Annie, and he be doomed to disappointment again; for she neither wished nor deemed it probable that his feelings, if they were taking that direction, could be reciprocated. Something of this fear was probably apparent in her face, which so faithfully revealed in its transparent trutlffiul- ness her thoughts, as they sat together one day, after his pupil, having got through with her lessons, had   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      249 gone out for recreations Looking up at his sister, and gazing intently in her face a moment, he said: "Yes, Anstrice, I do love Annie; but not as you are appre- hensive I do. I love her as I might have loved a younger sister, or perhaps as a daughter. But from the ashes of my heart no new pllenix of passion will ever arise. It is dead, dead for ever to such a feeling. Had I been strong and manly as you were, my sister, it might have been otherwise, - and I should not have wasted so much of my own life, nor blasted yours by my weakness, as I now realize I have done. But upon the past it is useless to 'dwell mournfully.' Hereafter I will strive to be no longer a drag upon you; but I will do what I can to aid you in your efforts to redeem our estate, that we may leave it unencumbered to Annie and James, if he proves himself worthy. In her happy youth, we will find' consolation for our own early sor- rows." Mr. Ellis then proceeded to lay before his sister some plans that he had formed- for taking up the mortgage, whllich had so long embarrassed them in their means and enjoyments. He exhibited a clearness and pre- cision of judgment in this, the first business enterprise in which he ever engaged, such as she never supposed he possessed; for in. his younger days hel had never taken any interest whatever in practical matters. He smiled as he again read her thoughts in her face, and said: I remember, when I was younger than I am now, Anstrice, you once told me I was as restless, as sparkling, as inconstant as the ocean wave, now rising, now falling, now breaking upon the, shore and flying upwards in wreaths of foam and diamonds of lighllt, now receding dark and sullen. I felt at the time, that if what you said was true, I also, like the seal had my   250      HERE AND HEREAFTER: depths of calm waters. I have never proved- it to you yet; perhaps now I may." And he arose and walked the room with the energy of youth and the steadiness of confirmed manliness. Here was a marvel surely. As potent to him for the renewal of his life had been the youth, the grace, the innocence of Annie. Clarke, as were fabled Medea's sacrifices, caldron, and spells upon the aged father of Jason.

"It beareth the name of Vanity Fair, because the town where it is kept is lighter than vanity, and also because that all that is there sold, or that cometh thither, is vanity.', -JOHN BUNYAN. DURIN G all the sickness that prevailed at N , Mr. Fitzroy's household had escaped unscathed; and, with the exception of giving money for the relief of the suf- ferers when applied to, neither he nor his wife interested themselves in the least in their afflicted neighbors. When little George Norton died, they both came to Ihis funeral, it is true, and a week -later Mrs. Fitzroy made a formal call of condolence on Mrs. Norton; on which occasion, after using such set phrases as she had learned in fashionable society for that purpose, she told her cousin how miserably thin and pale she looked, recommended a journey, dilated on her own ailments of body and grievances of spirit, in the care of Miss Clavers, offered to kiss Felice, which offer was most un- graciously responded to, and then took leave, inwardly exclaiming, as she entered her carriage, "Thank good- ness, that's over. Somehow or other," she proceeded to herself, '"I seem farthei from Delia than ever. When we were first married, we used to meet and chat cheer- fully enough; and I did n't mind her good advice. Now I dread it. I wonder why." Did Mrs. Fitzroy in her heart (' wonder why"? Did she not know, that, although she and her cousin had com- menced one stage of their life-journey at the same time,   252       HERE AND HEREAFTER: they had taken different points of departure, while the goals they each had in view were wide asunder; and that, as they travelled on, each in her own chosen road, the distance between them widened and widened withl every advancing step? Did she not know, that, although she was idle and frivolous, both from habit and educa- tion at the time of her marriage, she was, lnevertheless, susceptible to good influences, and still retained a re- membrance of her father's last days, which inclined her heart to better things; and consequently there was still some common ground upon which she and her cousin could meet? But now that her election had been made, did she not know that the very presence of her cousin was a condemnation of herself, and the life she was liv- ing? Nay, more, did she not feel in her company that the veil was put aside from the delusions which she' hugged so closely, and they were seen in their own unmasked hollowness? Mrs. Fitzroy did know all this, but she did not care to acknowledge it to herself. Upon the past- she never dwelt if she could avoid it. Indeed, she desired to forget the past, and she found her waters of Lethe in an intense devotion to present pleasures and enjoyment. She was as eager now in the pursuit of them as her hus- band could wish; and since the outhreak at Mrs. Har- ris's picnic, they had lived on much more amicable terms than for some time previous. If she still occa- sionally, or even daily, resorted to stimulants, she was careful not to exceed certain limits; for as yet the habit had not gained such ascendency that she could not con- trol it. As for her child, he continued a weak, puny thing; but, for some cause or other, she now never in- terfered with the nurse about his -management. The woman seemed to the other servants to have obtained   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       253 an inexplicable power over Mrs. Fitzroy, and in many respects was more the mistress of the house than she herself. About a week previous to the time the family at Oak Park went into the city, Mrs. Norton called to-see her cousin respecting a servant for whom she was desirous to obtain a situation, taking the unwilling Felice with her. She found her, as usual at that hour of the day, in tier morning room, lying upon the couch reading, and was received with a good deal of cordiality. "How good it is of you, Delia/,to come and see me," she said, rising to greet her, " although I did n't expect it. Ah, Felice, how are you, child? How she grows like her father. Don't you think so?  O, I for- got you never saw him; well, she does. I am glad to see you: this novel does n't end to suit me; and I 've my nerves worn out with that tiresome Elenore. She puts on as many airs as if she was the descendant of kings, instead of being the granddaughter of a respect- able tallow-chandler." "Why do you care for her airs, Clara?  They can't effect you, a mere child as she is." "But they do affect me, I assure you. You; see she's just been a spoiled, pampered thing from   her cradle, and is as impossible to manage as Felice "- lowering her voice, but not so much that she was not heard where she did not wish to be - " ever was. Now Mr. Fitzroy wants me to keep in with her, so that all her aristocratic relatives may visit us. That I could do well enough, if he did n't also want me to see that she gets on with her education; for he is, of course, exceedingly anxious she would be a credit to his guardianship. I tell him he's quite paternal in the interest he takes in his ward; and of course you know if she is not an elegant and accom-    254      HERE AND HEREAFTER: plished woman, it will reflect upon us; and such an heiress too. Well, the child hates study, but that would n't so much matter, for Mademoiselle Lafraind says she can teach her enough to appear well; but she hates music, too, won't practise, and wears us all out with her caprice and obstinacy; says she has money and does nt require accomplishments, and the most aggra- vating things beside. Olnly the other day she told me if I took as much care of Clarence as I did of her music, I should be more in the way of my duty; says she knows what we want her here for, but she guesses her relatives won't visit me." How much farther she would have gone into the de- tails of her trials with Miss Elenore is uncertain, had not Mrs. Norton, taking advantage of a pause, opened her commission. "A place as chamber-maid, did you say, Delia? 0 yes, there is one to be vacant when we go into town, I believe; but I think Mrs. March has a, niece she wants the place for." "Are you pledged to Mrs. March, Clara?" "O dear, no; only she mentioned that perhaps her niece could be induced to come, only she is in such an excellent situation now." "In that case, probably you would do as well to take a girl whom I know all about, and can recommend, and who will be thankful for the place, and do her best to please you, as to take one who needs- to be persuaded to come, and may wish you to feel that she is conferring a favor." "I dare say I should," was the energetic reply. "These girls are such nuisances; they carry their heads so high. Why, my cook, a friend of Mrs. March, does n't wish me to come into the kitchen, and when I ven-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      255 ture to tell her anything does n't quite suit me, she flares up, and says, ' Perhaps Mrs. Fitzroy would like to get a new cook; I am ready to go at any moment.'" "Well, why not take this girl, Clara, who has no airs?" "I 'll see what Mrs. March says, and let you know." At this moment, Miss Elenore Clavers's maid came to the door and said that the young lady would like to see little Miss Lascelles. '"Yes, go, Felice, do," said- Mrs. Fitzroy. "Let her, Delia, I want to talk a little longer, I go so soon to the city, and you never come there to see me." Mrs. Norton gave a reluctant consent, and Felice as reluctantly went away with the maid. When she en- tered Miss Clavers's room, that authoritative little lady rose from a large arm-chair in which she was sitting and greeted her cordially, and immediately said: "Why did n't you come here to live instead of me?" "I don't know of but two reasons: one was, Aunt Clara did n't want me; and the other, I did n't want to come." "Why not want to come? Everything here is much finer and gayer than at Rosedale, Nelly, my maid, tells me." "I don't care for such things, if, you do. I care for people, not for finery. If they had brought me here, I would never have stayed. I would have run away days and nights till I got so far off they could n't find me." "What would you have done then?" asked the min- iature fine lady, eying her companion with interest and curiosity. "I would have died and gone to my father." This she said in a tone so grave and solemn that Ele- nore could not laugh. She only said: "Well, I don't   256      HERE AND HEREAFTER:  much blame you. They want to make a fine accom- plished lady of me. I hate study; I hate music; I hate embroidery. I wish they would let me alone. I 're money enough to do nothing, if I like; and there's people enough to show me attention as long as that lasts. I've lived long enough to find that out." And this embryo philosopher of twelve yawned listlessly. '"But you would n't be happy yourself if you did n't know anything." "Yes I should, child. I 'm not a dunce now; I pick up as I go along. I can dance, read, and write; sing a little. That 's all I want to know. What good does all my Aunt Hightop's learning do her? She knows all sorts of things. She could dress, give dinner and even- ing parties just as well without as with it." "But there is something else to be done in the world beside enjoy ourselves, Mamma Delia says." "O yes, for good folks; but I don't belong to that set, nor any of my relatives except my Uncle Edgar Manning, who is a poor minister somewhere in New York. I suppose they live a horrid life though, as they have but one servant. But some time I mean to go and see them, you see if I don't. I never-had a chance yet to live or visit anywhere but among just such people as Aunt Hightop and Mrs. Fitzroy.- I am coming to see you too; I know your mamma will let me if you ask her."' Felice hardly knew what to say. That Elenore was not such a companion as Mrs. Norton would choose for her she was quite certain, yet she sympathized so warm- ly with the young heiress in her dislike of her present home, that she began to feel a good deal interested in her behalf, and presently said: "I will ask Mamma Delia."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       257 And so, Elenore asking questions and Felice answer- ing them, the two girls chatted on after the fashion of their elders, rather than in a. style more suited to their years, for one was'old by education and the other by nature. "What a sad thiing the death of Mrs. Harris's little boy is, Delia," said Mrs. Fitzroy, as Felice went out. ," The death of Mrs. Harris's little boy? I had not heard of it." ' Yes, it was very sudden; this morning, of croup, one of my servants told me. I don't think he has been sick any time. Day before yesterday Mrs. Harris was here in fine spirits." "What a dreadful shock!" And Mrs. Norton's eyes filled with tears in recollection of her own recent sor- row. The two children were about the same age. "Yes, terrible, and such a disappointment too!" "O yes, her only boy!" "Yes, but I did n't mean that so much, though, of course, it's very dreadful. But didn't you know she was all ready to go to Europe? And she had such lots of lovely things made up, though that was useless; as I told her, if she went to Paris she would get an entire outfit there. But she said no matter, they would do for England, where the ladies dressed dowdy in the streets. She was full of her tour. She said her husband would never go while his father lived,-- so foolish in him, for the old gentleman was always well taken care of, T- and so hard, too, to deny her in this, when he let her do as she pleased in almost everything else. Now, of course, the European tour must be put off, and if she goes in the spring she 'll have to wear black, and it 's not be- coming to her. It's such a pity." "I am afraid," said Mrs. Norton, coldly, " that I 22    258      HERE AND HEREAFTER: cannot sympathize much with her in her disappoint- ment." "Why you know, Delia, the affliction is a great one, but then you know everybody does n't take these things to heart as you do; and she has five others." "And he was her only boy," repeated Mrs. Norton, as if to herself, and then thought, " such a loss to be weighed against a journey abroad! Shall I trouble you to call Felice, Clara? I wish you would let me see the baby." "Mrs. March says he is so delicate she does n't like to have strangers see him; and she's so careful." "I hope she is, Clara. If you need me at any time after you go into the city, don't hesitate to send for me." Chance afforded Mrs. Norton the opportunity the mother denied her of seeing her child, for as she was going down stairs, she met Jane with little Clarence. As she stooped to speak to him, he at first drew back and seemed afraid of her in her black dress; but when she smiled and spoke to him, he smiled in response, although still clinging to the girl. But Mrs. Fitzroy hurried them off, saying it was chilly and the child would take cold. Mrs. Norton saw enough, however, to convince her that the poor little fellow was still droop- ing, and either suffering from some hidden disease, or from bad management. Her heart yearned towards him, so pleading was his patient face; but she saw it was useless to attempt to interfere. So she simply said, "I should have the best medical advice in the case of that child, if I were you, Clara." Felice at that moment made her appearance, ac- companied by Elenore Clavers, who, going up to Mrs. Norton, said: "May I come to your house to see   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       259 Felice? I believe she thinks you don't wish me to. But may n't I?" "Certainly, dear, if you would like to," said Mrs. Norton, interested in her frank, open face, despite her elaborate dress, better suited to a fashionable lady of twenty than a child of twelve. Mrs. Fitzroy listened with astonishment to this re- quest, and was not altogether pleased. When the door closed upon her visitors, she said, with some little sharpness in her tone: "What new whim is this, Miss' Clavers, to visit such a child as Felice? I am not at all sure your Aunt Hiightop or Mr. Fitzroy would approve of the acquaintance. Mrs. Norton's friends are not in our set." "Thle very reason I want to go there. I am sick of our set, and should like to see if I should n't like an- other better. And I am going to tease Aunt Hightop next summer to let me go to Uncle Edgar's." "You might as well spare your teasing for some attainable object; she will never let you go there, you may rest assured," was the energetic answer. "Won't she? I guess I know how to manage Aunt Hightop," was the reply of the determined young lady. And so they separated, Mrs. Fitzroy to return to her morning room to look out a dress for dinner, and Ele- nore to worry the patience and grind the nerves of her unfortunate governess.   260       HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXV. "There are two souls whose equal flow In gentle streams so calmly run, That when they part -they part?- ah no! They cannot part; - those souls are one." - BENARD BARTON. "Large charity doth never soil, But only soften, soft white hands." - J. R. LOWELL. MATTERS connected with the firm of Carter and Nor- ton required one of the partners to make a trip to England early in the winter. At first Mr. Carter pro- posed to go, but as the time drew near for his departure, he alluded to it with such evident dread, sometimes speaking of his unwillingness to leave his motherless children, that Mr. Norton, whose sympathies had been a good deal excited in his behalf since his wife's death, felt that it was his duty to offer to take his place. When he informed his wife of the, proposed change of plan, she expressed her feelings by saying, " O Leslie, how could you?" "The question is not settled yet, and I will leave it to you to decide it, my dear, after you have heard my reasons. In the first place, I am the junior partner, and consequently ought to undertake any such duty, unless Mr. Carter wishes otherwise. Then you know how he has suffered in consequence of his affliction, and how tenderly he is cherishing -his little ones. His health, too, has evidently declined under the pressure of his sorrow. It is true his physician has advised his going abroad, and undoubtedly it would prove beneficial !   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      261 to him, if he could do it and dismiss his griefs and anxieties about home. But this is almost impossible with him." "O, I don't wish to dissuade you from doing what you think is your duty, Leslie. I spoke from impulse. When must you leave, and when will you be back again?" "The first steamer in December; the time is close at hand you see. My return is uncertain. Perhaps a month will be sufficient for the business, but it may de- tain me longer. It's possible I shall be obliged to go on the Continent, but the affairs I have to attend to will keep me for the most part in London." "Well," said his wife, drawing a long breath, " if it is your duty to make this voyage at this season of the year, there is nothing to be said. I don't mind -that is, so very much the separation, if- " ," If what, Delia? Speak out what is in your mind." "If I could feel sure of your safe return. But this crossing the ocean in midwinter, I confess I dread; and then--" She paused, but to her husband's kind, in- quiring look, presently added, "Since one of my treas- ures has been taken from me, I cling the more closely to those remaining, and feel the more anxious about them too." "The same God is on the sea as on the land, dearest, and He can protect the wanderer on the deep as securely as by the home fireside. It is a great trial to me to leave you all. Since I have found a home, and such a home too, of my own to dwell in, I have thought I should never go away from it, or my native land again; aor should I, voluntarily. So whatever betides, Delia, remember that duty, not inclination, separated us." "I will, Leslie, and I will endeavor to put as cheerful   262      HERE AND HEREAFTER:  a face on the necessity as you do. And now tell me  what you require to be done." Needing some assistance in fitting off her husband, Mrs. Norton engaged the services of Mrs. Hart, men- tioned in a previous chapter, whose consumptive hus- band had recently died, leaving her with three little children to provide for. She was Irish, and had seen better days in her native country, having been for sev- eral years an upper servant in one of the best families of the county to which she belonged. She was a very nice seamstress, and the mistress of Rosedale had given her employment, and in fact made work for her, as in- deed she had done for many others, after having become acquainted with her circumstances, besides rendering her all the assistance she would receive; for the woman possessed a resolute and determined spirit, and was very unwilling to be considered an object of charity. When she was informed that Mr. Norton was to take the steamer for Liverpool, she exclaimed: "And if he could only see my brother!               ,v "Where is your brother?" asked Mrs. Norton. "In Liverpool, ma'am. Our mother was English, and when things went so hard with us at home after our father died, she sent Hugh to her relations in Liverpool. It's years since I 've had a word from him now; and if he's alive, I think he could be found by applying at the house of Randall Brothers, where he and our relations worked so many years." "1 I will tell Mr. Norton; and if he has time, I am sure lie will find your brother."  "If he should, ma'am, and tell Hugh how badly off we are in the world, I know he'd help us; that is, ma'am, if he's the same good-hearted fellow he used to be ; but I 've heard nothing from him for ten years m   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       263 or more, since we came away from New London. What a bright, handsome lad he was, when he left home, and is honest and brave as he was handsome." And the poor woman's thoughts, bereaved as she was of her husband and eldest son, naturally reverted to the loved companion of her youthful days; and the Rugh Moriarty of her imagination was a strange com- pound of the frank, handsome, curly-headed boy, and the staid, reliable husband and father, but always a brother to be loved and looked up to. Mr. Norton, when informed of Mrs. Hart's wishes, took down the name of the firm and street in his note- book, saying, as he did so, "It is a doubtful matter if I find the man, but I will make the attempt if it is a pos- sible thing in the little time I shall have in Liverpool." A few days later the parting was over; and Leslie Norton was on the broad ocean once more, bearing up with his brave heart and cheerful trust against the sep- aration from his family. When about half the passage had been made, a ter- rific storm was encountered, and, although he was not without his apprehensions of the result, he awaited it with the calmness of one who has faith in '"Him who is the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them who are afar off on the sea."  The noble vessel sus- tained no serious damage, however, and arrived in safety at her destined port inl the usual time. Perhaps, irrespective of sex and difference of temper- ament, the trial of separation is always greater to those who remain at home than to those who go away. In the daily routine of accustomed employments, there is not only ample leisure to think much about the absent, but it is scarcely possible to avoid it, associated as they are in some way with almost every act of domestic life.   264      HERE AND HEREAFTER: When for 'the first time he who is the head and centre of the household absents himself from it, - and this is written with all due deference to woman's rights, -how dreary the void that is made ; how desolate home seems to be; how strange to miss the accustomed footfall, whose very tread brings with it such a feeling of strength and protection; how sad not to hear the cheer- ful sound of the voice, whose accents come so gratefully to the ears of wife and child! And then, where is tile mind so evenly balanced, so confiding in its faith, that can always keep back the thought, "What if this shall be for ever?"  The raging sea may devour, the pesti- lence may destroy at midday, the midnight robber or as- sassin may strike down, or wasting disease may consume, that form so loved and cherished, may silence that dear voice, while patiently those at home await the coming  which shall be nevermore in this world; nevermore! To say that Delia Norton -felt this void, and sometimes was oppressed by these anxieties, is only to say what is true and natural. Perhaps the painful uneasiness of mind which she experienced was greater than it would have been at another season, on account of the sorrows of her heart, which yet was full of the mother's undy- ing love for the little one that had been taken from her. However, she did not sit down and fold her hands in  idle, trembling waiting, but in active employment found the best balm to her griefs. It was an exceedingly severe winter; and as stormi after storm came enveloping the earth in its white shroud, and only passed away to give place to intenser cold, the sufferings of the poor were very great. Those wiho were beyond the reach of want themselves, and whoso hearts were not frozen in their breasts by selfishness,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.  i     265 had all their sympathies awakened in behalf of their less fortunate neighbors. Provisions, too, were very high. Those heartless speculators who had kept their wheat and corn locked up in their stores rather than sell at a fair price and good profit, and who, the summer previous, had suffered cargoes of potatoes to rot, rather than deal them out to the hungry at an adequate return for their outlay, might now have seen some of the results of their inhumanity, had they been disposed to go into many a distressed neighborhood, both in the city and in the country. But little recked they about such results, so long as they could find room where to bestow their fruits, and could say, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry." "To one, and another, and, another of such, who lived in luxury upon their fellow-creatures whose scanty gains were inadequate to their daily wants, in the course of that inclement winter came the summons, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?" Better cold, and frost, and hunger, than the terrible reckoning of that dread hour! The same committee of ladies in N   , who had been so efficient at the period of the sickness, with some additions, now became equally so in this time of need, visiting the houses of the poor to ascertain their wants, procuring and giving work, where it could be done, and thus warding off the suffering in every way in their power. Mrs. Norton continued to give the village chil- dren employment, and many a dime did they carry home to help buy food, and many a bundle of fagots besides, to kindle their fires. The neighboring city also 23 t    266      HERE AND HEREAFTER: looked to her country sisters for aid in clothing her naked, and not inll vain. For this season, the sewing society was made a strictly benevolent one, and Mrs. Norton took good care to supply material as fast as it was needed, which ready hands soon converted into useful, warm garmpents; and after the wants of their own destitute had been supplied therefrom, bundles were sent to the city for a like purpose. All these efforts for the relief of the suffering were not made without faultfinding and dissatisfaction in ll several quarters. Some contended that it was not a wise policy to aid families whose head was earning comrn- men daily wages, and had regular employment; for there was danger that they would become idle, and de- pendents upon charity. , But Mr. Howe, who lknew by experience how difficult it was to make the same sum meet one's expenses from year to year, when the cost of the necessaries of life was so uncertain, contended that it was the positive duty of the rich to assist such poor. "They have barely enough for their wants under the most favorable circumstances," he said, " and when pro- visions can be obtained at a moderate rate. How can they get along at such a time as this, when I hear the wealthy groaning over the price of flour and beef?" To the argument that the wages of the laboring poor had been increased, it did not take long to show, by a. simple process of arithmetic, that they had not by any means in proportion to the relative cost of living. Others again objected to rendering assistance to the Irish, condemning them all as idle, improvident, waste- ful, and deceitful. Here Miss Ellis, with her strong love of justice, took up the cudgel in behalf of that much sinning and much sinned against people. She said she ,!   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      ' 267 was ready to admit that some of them deserved the character just bestowed upon them. "Perhaps," she added, " there are some of our own nation, even in this goodly town of N , to whom the same remark would apply. I don't think the best of our foreign population pursue a very wise course to in- spire us, native-born citizens, with any great confidence in them, but for my part I shall, not willingly withhold aid from a needy family because it happens to be Irish, or because I run the risk of being imposed upon. To my own knowledge, there are among them some who are honest, careful, and deserving assistance." So Mrs. Norton and ladies of like spirit and purpose went on their way of beneficence, visiting in cold and storm from house to house, and doing what they could to bear one anotler's burdens. That they had their reward, who can doubt that has ever borne aid and comfort to any distressed feilow-mortal? Mrs. Norton, remembering her own early training in this respect, never failed to take the large-hearted Felice with her upon her errands of mercy whenever it was practicable, feeling, as she did, that one scene of poverty and suffer- ing witnessed eye to eye, would make a deeper and more abiding impression than any number of harrowing tales related by a drawing-room fire. When Mr. Norton left home, it had been arranged for Howard or Duncan Leslie to stay at the house during his absence. Mrs. Norton had invited Annie Clarke to be with her also. Miss Ellis, however, discovering that for some reason or other her young relative was averse to the plan, did not urge her going, but promised her to Mrs. Norton at such times as she might need her. Howard Leslie insisted, withl his utmost determination,   268      HERE AND HEREAFTER: that it was out of the question for him to go to his cousin's, and Duncan must; and as his mother, think- ing tie change might be serviceable to the younger brother, in whom she had noticed evident depression of spirits of late, favored the plan, he was forced to yield an unwilling consent. \^   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        269 CHAPTER XXVI. "Some said it might do good; others said no." -JOHN BUNYAN. "We pity the folly of the lark, which, while it playeth with the feather and stoopeth to the glass, is caught in the fowler's net; and yet, cannot see our- selves alike made fools by Satan: who, deluding us by the vain feathers and glasses of the world, suddenly enwrappeth us in his snares." -BISHOP HALL. ANNIE CLARKE went almost daily to Rosedale in Mr. Norton's absence, and was ever ready to assist its gener- ous mistress in her labors for the poor; and as they sat in the latter's chamber, their busy fingers keeping time with their good intentions, they enjoyed many a happy hour together. Annie's character, never, childish, had by the cultiva- tion of her mind and affections ripened into one of great maturity and thoughtfulness; and if a shade of pensive sadness sometimes stole over her beautiful face, it only served to add to her loveliness and make her a more attractive companion for Mrs. Norton. The conversation of the two ladies was as varied as it was entertaining,- sometimes relating to the books they had read, sometimes to their benevolent undertakings, and sometimes, but not often, touching upon the mys- teries of life, which few can discuss deeply without some danger to their simple faith. One day, as they sat thus at their work, Miss Ellis joined them, having just been to Riverside with Mrs. Brown.  She drew a long breath as she took the offered arm-chair near Madam Norton, and said: "Lights and shadows!   I thought the sun 23    did n't shine when I was at Mrs. Green's just now; but lo! how brigt it is here. Poor, poor woman ! how I pity her! Her husband is worse than ever this winter; and she is struggling so hard to feel right and do right. I believe she's fast fitting for a better world than this. If the Lord takes her, I, for one, shall heartily say amen. Ann, too, has one of her lazy fits to-day, and I could only rouse her by telling her Annie *as expecting her this evening." " This evening!" said Mrs. Norton. " Why, you half promised me this evening, Annie; Miss Ellis, are you afraid to trust her with me after dark ? I shall begin to think so, for as soon as the sun goes down she gener- ally has some excuse for returning home." "Not in the least; she's a most trusty young lady, I assure you, Mrs. Norton.    That is proved by her coming    to us, when she knows  you will have your cousin's company." As Miss Ellis spoke, she caught a  glimpse of Annie's face.  Something which she saw there caused her to pause.  Taking up a   book lying on the table, she said, with an abruptness in changing subjects not unusual to her, "The Heir of Redclyffe.  Do    you read religious novels, Mrs. Norton ?" " Such religious novels as that I  do; don't you ?" "I've never read the book.  IndeedI'm no novel- reader; if I were one, commend me to real fiction, not to a   religious dissertation in disguise." "That I should n't like any better than you; but I don't think 'The Heir of Redclyffe' is a book of that description. If a novel is intended to be a picture of life, as it is and as it should be, however, why should so important an element as religion be left out of it, -  the only element that makes your true hero and heroine,   while the want of it makes your knaves and villains. And if every otlier feeling and emotion of the human heart may be the subject of fictitious writing, lwhy may not those of religion also ? " "c I should have no objection to novels, in which the results of religion, or, rather, its effects upon the char- acter are shown; but I don't want to see its, ier workings exposed to view,-the very secrets of the heart and its most sacred feelings acted upon by this divine power, paraded before the world. Besides, your male and female saints in fiction are never such per- sons as are met with in every-day life; their struggles  are not such as common people have; their convictions of sin are magnified, and in the end their virtues are impossible. For my own part, I don't much fancy such saints." '" I don't think so, Miss Ellis," replied Mrs. Norton, gravely. " I am quite certain as hard battles have been fought with the arch-enemy    of souls in actual as in imaginary life.'" "  Exceptions such, however, to the general rule. For my own part, I never had a novel experience of religion; but thenl  I 'm not a novel character, and never expect to be."  "Do you think, Miss Ellis, a novelist could paint a more perfect heroine than our Mrs. Carter, married though she was. Yet what sort of a character would hers hlave been without religion ? Amiable and inter- esting, without any doubt, but she could not have been the woman shle Was, whom all loved and respected." " True, but Mrs. Carter was a rare character; one in whom   you saw the results of religion, not its interior working, not exactly such a personage as you find in religious novels. Could her biography be truly written,     272       HERE AND HEREAFTER':  it would be worth more than all the pious fiction that saintly or unsaintly brains ever conceived. Mrs. Nor- ton, your Sir Guys, you may depend, are found some- where else than on this eartli. Besides, there is a place for religion lnd a place for amusement; don't mingle them together, and seek to do away the distinction that must ever exist between them."  "Only as I would in real life. As I would carry the spirit of Christ in my heart to a party or a concert, so would I like to feel its presence in the books I read,  - even for recreation. Then consider, Miss Ellis, how many persons there are whose reading is almost wholly fiction; may not some good seed be sown therein, and thus be scattered broadcast over the land -in railroad cars, steamboats, and hotels? And is it not better so, than that religion should be confined to sober, and not always attractive treatises, which few have the patience or the inclination to read? Besides, I think if fiction cannot be employed in illustrating and enforcing religion, it cannot be used for any strictly moral purpose 1vhat- ever."1 ' We are at issue as to results, I perceive, Mrs. Norton. I maintain that the good seed cannot be sown by means of highly wrought representations of religion, or of im- possible religious attainments. As I said before, I have never read this book, but I 've read several reviews oft it. I imagine your Sir'Guy to be the embodiment of all saintliness after inconceivable struggles and sacri- fices to correct his natural faults of character. Is it not so?       " "Not quite, Miss Ellis. Re becomes a Christian in his faith and purposes, very much suchl a Christian as one sometimes is privileged to meet with. There never was but one embodiment of saintliness in this world, He   ORB THE TWO ALTARS.        273 who is our master and example, - shall we contend for   I anything less than that in fiction? One reason, it ap- pears to me, why there are not more Sir Guys in the world, more ardent strivers after holiness, is because so few think it worth their while to carry into religion the same warmth and zeal that they do into the other affairs and interests of life. And one remedy for the evil, I tlhink, would be to represent religion as a genial, ear- nest, cheerful sentiment in works of fiction. Let it be in the romance, what it is designed to be, and sometimes is found to be in reality. If in some books too large a place appears to be given to it in the workings of the human heart, may not the apparent fault be set down to the low estimate at which it is held, rather than to de- fects in the books themselves, or misapprehensions in their writers. If human love is a proper subject for the novelist to handle, why may not religion be, whose es- sence is Divine love?" "Simply because, as I said before, I would have re- ligion treated in religious books, - in sermons, essays, biographies, perhaps allegories." "Yes, and get one reader where the novelist has thousands. And after all, Miss Ellis, what a paltry, barren life it is. in fiction or in the world, which has not religion for its corner-stone. I am no advocate of cant or of such unnatural experiences as never yet the heart of man or woman had; but I'do advocate that genial religiousness which imparts a certain indefinable charm to the character wherever it is found; and this is what I like to find in novels." "But, Mrs. Norton, who ever talks in actual life as your religious people do in novels?" "You and I might, and do, sometimes, Miss Ellis." "I am certain I never talked as godly pious people   274      HERE AND HEREAFTER: are made to in such religious novels as I used to read, when I was some years younger than I am now." "Men and books may have changed somewhat since then. Sir Charles Grandison would make but a formal hero for a romance of our times;'and the stilted cant and pious talk of the past century would as little suit the genius of the present day. Read ' Tle Heir,' Miss Ellis, before you decide against him. I am sure you will not object to the beautiful religious spirit which is inwroughllt into the life of its principal characters. I can sympathize with Sir Guy in his trials on account of his fiery temper, as you probably cannot, although I am far from having attained to his Christian excellence." "I will read Sir Guy, my dear Mrs. Norton. Be- tween you and Anniel I shall soon have no character or opinions of my own left. Sometimes a little word from  her sets me a thinking in a way that I never did before, and I am obliged to abandon many a cherished opinion; and whlen I am so foolish as to engage in an argument with you, lo! out goes the foundation from some old notion of mine, and the building of years comes toppling down like a child's card-house." "Thank you, Miss Ellis, I .don't claim any such dis- tinction as that. But our age is a progressive one, and I don't doubt that those who profess to belong to the past may learn something from the present, and all who know her, feel how beautiful is the' admixture of the two in the character of Miss Ellis, in which is found the true golden mean." A few days subsequent to theconversation above nar- rated, Mrs. Norton met Mrs. Harris in the village, who informed her that she saw Mrs. Fitzroy two days pre- vious, and that her little Clarence was quite sick. The A   275 OR, THE TWO ALTARS. next day Mrs. Norton went into town to see her cousin and the child, well knowing that, owing to the; influence of the nurse, she would not be sent for until the last Yo'ment, even if anything serious was apprehended. Arrived at Mr. Fitzroy's handsome city residence, she was surprised at the confusion, as if in preparation of some great evet. The servant, as usual, showed her up stairs to her cousin's own room, whom she found standing before a large mirror arranging the folds of a Turkish turban; and the room was strewed with arti- cles of apparel of great gorgeousness. Mrs. Fitzroy turned around quickly, and for once her usual self-pos- session deserted her. 4' Why, Delia," she exclaimed, " this is indeed unex- pected. lHow stupid in Brooks to bring you here in all this confusion, though it s confusion everyw here as to that matter. There," sweeping away, as she spoke, a pile of silks and ribbons, and drawing out a chair, " do sit down." "What's this, Clara?" asked Mrs. Norton, wonder- ingly; ' I heard Clarence was sick, and came in to see him." "O, he was sick last week, but he -s better now; and we 've sent out cards for a fancy ball. You know, Delia, there's a vast deal of suffering this winter among the poor, and Mr. Fitzroy thought we ought to do some- thing, so we got up this ball. It's to be a splendid affair. I've chosen Rebecca for my character, Mr. Fitz- roy says I shall look so well in her costume. If wet could only have had you for Rowena, only your hair is a little too dark; but I knew how you would feel about it; though, to be sure, being for charity, it's different. It's a great deal of labor, Delia, but tihen you know the cause is so good, and Mr. Fitzroy wished it so much.   276       HERE AND HEREAFTER;           i Nearly all to whom invitations were sent have accepted, I expect it will be the grandest affair of the season, and I tell Mr. Fitzroy we shall be doing positive good to this Puritan city in giving a higher tone to taste and fashion." Shades of Winthrop, Cotton, Boylston, Mather! Lis- ten to Mrs. Leonard Fitzroy, in this the high noon of the nineteenth century! Mrs. Norton suffered her cousin to go on without at- tempting to interrupt heor, or even to make any remarks when she had the opportunity; but she could not help thinking all the time how many different ways of doing good there were in the world. Mrs. Fitzroy seemed unusually uneasy and anxious to justify herself. "I suppose you don't quite approve of this sort of thing, Delia," she continued; "but then you know there are very few  people who act from your motives, and Mr. Fitzroy thought we could raise more money in this way than in any other. He is deeply interested in it; you can't tell how much.  Why, when I told him what an immense sum   it would cost, he answered it was in a good cause, and then he said something about giving to the poor and lending to the Lord. He got it out of the Bible, I believe. ,So you see how much his heart is set upon it, for I never knew him to quote Scripture before in my life." "Very much, I    should think," said Mrs. Norton, dryly; and she thought, not unnaturally, perhaps, "And thus I clothe my naked villany With old odd ends, stolen forth of holy writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil." Mrs. Fitzroy, evidently unusually excited, proceeded: ' What do you hear from Mr. Norton?    Shocking to be   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       2" alone in that dull place, isn't it? Why didn't you bring Felice ; Elenore teases me to death to let her go to N   to see you. All her relatives are coming to the ball. Mrs. Hightop will appear as Cleopatra; she has a full figure, and will become that character exactly. Mrs. Harris is dying of vexation that we did n't have this last winter, when she could come. Yes, to a servant,' I will see Mrs. Ray, directly; let her wait. Don't go, Delia. Won't you stop and dine? Pray do." "Thaink you, Clara, T must go home; I do n't think I should be of any service to you. Clarence is really better?" "O yes, a great deal! We were so anxious about him for two days,- we thought we should be obliged to give up this affair, and Mfr. Fitzroy was almost be-. side himself; he would have him in our dressing-room, -I never supposed he cared half so much for him. Good by, if you must go." And with an indescribable feeling of relief Mrs. Fitz- roy saw the hail door close after her cousin.  As she turned to go up stairs again she encountered Brooks, to whom she administered a sharp reprimand for bring- ing iMrs. Norton to her room. Then she stopped in the drawing-room to find fault with some decorations which the servants were putting up under her own directions; then meeting the cook, she asked her why she had not attended to her orders about the soup for dinner; and finally, coming upon Mrs. March upon the stairs, with Clarence, ended by telling her to keep the child in the nursery and not bring him into the cold. Mrs. March had her revenge, however, for her share in the general castigation by whispering in the excited lady's ear-: ' If you please ma'am, you better not speak 24- \   278      HERE AND HEREAFTER: quite so loud; some of the servants mistrusts already you is queerish like." This was enough; Mrs. Fitzroy hastened to her own room and was about to lock the door, when the child's nurse entered with a cup in her hand, which she offered to her, significantly saying: I Take this, ma'am, and lay down. You 'll feel better for it: and trust me to keep silent." ' O," she groaned, as the door closed after the woman, "how could I have put myself in the power of such a person! What will Delia think?" Meantime, with sad thoughts, Mrs. Norton was pur- suing her way to her peaceful home. Once her scorn would have been excited by the miserable subterfuge to which Mr. Fitzroy resorted to mask his love of pleasure in the guise of charity, and if a mingling of that feeling did exist in her heart, as she thought of the hypocrisy of his alleged motives, her sentiments to- wards her cousin were those of unmixed sorrow, as they had been of late almost every time she had parted from her; that she with her naturally amiable, if heed- less disposition, fair abilities, and energy of character, should devote herself so unreservedly to the pursuits of vanity and frivolity, neglecting her child, voluntarily throwing away sources of the purest happiness; content to live in God's beautiful world, the daily recipient of his bounty, yet owning no allegiance to him or the Saviour of the world to whom every knee should bow, and not even have the poor compensation of present, fleeting enjoyment in exchange. For in spite of her cousin's gay laugh and jesting tone, she saw that her heart was ill at ease, that the skeleton was ever at her most sumptuous feasts, the sepulchre in the garden of her gayest joys, the sword hair-suspended over her in her most luxurious private apartment.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       279 Notwithstanding the unfortunate education, which had twisted and perverted the goodly young sapling into the gnarled and crooked tree, she had yet been privileged, in years past, to catch glimpses of something better and nobler thlan what she had now become; and with her, thought could not be all the time repressed, or the voice of conscience stifled. 4 O0," said Mrs. Norton to herself, as she pondered over what she had just seen and heard, "if I could only do anything for Clara; but that is out of the question, for the present at least. All I can do for her is to pray for her; that I can always do, and if I pray in faith I know I shall be heard." As she entered her own door, Felice came bounding towards her with joyful greeting, and the laughing, ex- ultant Helen held out her hands to be taken, and Madam  Norton came forward with kindly inquiries. She felt more keenly then than ever the joys of a true home-welcome, so deeply was she impressed with the contrast between the present scene and that which she had so lately left.   280      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXVII. When the sun gives the sign to spread the tables, and intemperance brings in the messes, and drunkenness fills the bowls, then the man falls away, and leaves a beast in his room." -BISHOP TAYOR. As cheerless and desolate as any habitation in the village of N   was that of Mrs. Green. All she could do had been insufficient to keep the wolf from the door, while her husband, by his intemperate habits, was a constant drain upon her slender resources; for whenever she had money, get it he would, by fair means or foul. Of late, matters had come to such a pass, that the poor woman stood in almost daily terror of her life. One resolution, however, she had now come to, and that was, that not another cent of her earnings should be expended in brutifying her husband. She had consequently made arrangements with Mrs. Musgrave, Mrs. Norton, and other ladies, who supplied her with work, to have her bills paid. at the grocer's and other tradesmen, and not to receive the money into her own hands. When Mrs. Musgrave, with a touch of her old Hism, told the almost heart-broken wife and mother that she should have the spirit to resist such an unfeeling man; and that nothing would ever induce her to give up her children's bread to such a vile purpose, she answered, dejectedly: "Maybe you would, Miss Musgrave, and maybe you wouldn't. I once was as bent on having my own way, when I thought I was right, as anybody   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      281 ever could be, and held out as strong for it; but I'm 'bout broken up now, and, savin' for poor little Sarah, am ready to go when the Lord calls me. Ann and Sammy are in good hands now, they'd git along; but little Sarah, she 'd suffer." "Well, my good woman," said Mrs. Musgrave, her better feeling affected by Mrs. Green's words and man- ner, " keep up good heart, we 'll all befriend you." "Thank you, ma'am, I 've a deal more friends than I deserve, for I know I 've not borne my troubles as I ought. Somehow I 've no heart to fight agin 'em any longer. If John asks me for money, I'll tell him I 've got none. He 'll be awful mad, like as not he'll kill me; if he does, I 'll see my baby agin and Johnny, and the Lord will take care of little Sarah." "Don't talk so, Mrs. Green, don't, it makes me shud- der to hear you," said Mrs. Musgrave ; "there 's no fear of your husband's hurting you, and cross words don't kill." "Don't they though?" replied the woman, turning round, and fixing her large glittering eyes upon Mrs. Musgrave; "don't they kill? Don't they draw the blood from the heart and the tears from the eyes, till the fountain of both is dried up? What is killin' me but the sharp, bitter words, that day after day ring in my ears from him who once spoke to me, O how ten- derly? What but that has changed me from what I was eight years agone, a hearty, healthy, happy woman? Not hard work, not poverty, not sorrow; all these I bore and could bear, had John been himself through it all, for whether you think it so or no, Miss Musgrave, we poor folks have love in our hearts as strong as yours; maybe stronger, for if we have n't that at our board, what have we? No, no, don't tell me words don't kill, 24*   282      HERE AND HEREAFTER  till you 've heard them yourself from the man you love with all your heart; love with a love which should be God's own; from the mall who is the father of your little ones, who should be your protector and theirs; from the man who your foolish heart still clings to for all his sins agin you. Don't, I say, tell me so, till you've suf- fered what I have, till all the oaths and curses and vile names you could think of have been given to you for your daily bread. Look at me, ma'am," continued she, baring her left arm to the shoulder, and showing a long, deep, purple mark, which made Mrs. Musgrave recoil. "You say John won't hurt me. Who did that? Who has struck me on my head agin and agin, given me a blow in my side from which the pain has never left me, shaken me till the breath was almost out of my body? He won't hurt me! No, indeed." "Whly in Heaven's name," asked Mrs. Musgravre, " do you bear all this? Why don't you leave him?" "' Why?" and the woman straightened up her thin, stooping figure, and repeated, "Why? Because I loved him, and took him for better or worse. He shall kill me if he likes. And then," lowering her voice, " he's only been so bad since Johnny died. He loved Johnny. I loved Johnny. If Johnny's death made him worse, is it for me to abuse him? No, no. If you want to do me any good, Miss Musgrave, you jest go to the respect- able men who sell John liquor, when they know it makes a devil of him, you jest go to them. I've told you all this, Miss Musgrave, because I don't think you rightly know what kind of feelins we poor folks have, and 'cause I don't want to hear nothin' about leavin' him. It 11 do for fine ladies to leave their husbands 'cause their tein- pers don't suit; but poor folks must, for the most part, stick by one another through a deal worse things than   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       283 contrary tempers. Be so good, ma'am, as not bring or send me any more money, and excuse my freedom. I 'm a little light-headed, I b'leive, now and then." "Ann ought to go into the factory, Mrs. Green, and earn something for you; and Sammy is now large enough to help you." -"Ann is doin' very well for her now. A gal that 's been abused and worried for eight years, aint likely to be very handy nohow. Ann would die shut up in a factory. She does chores for Miss Ellis every day, and arns a good bit. Sammy works at Mr. Norton's all the time he can get- out of school; he 's'jest took to his larn- in'. Good day, ma'am." It was now mid-winter, and three days after the con- versation above related a genuine New England snow- storm was raging. Within the dwellings of the rich, families gathered together in brilliantly lighted rooms, around the cheerful table, and rejoiced, -as darkness set- tfled down upon the earth, that they were not exposed to the pitiless blasts. In the homes of the poor, parents and children clustered close around the dark stove, which but too often contained a scanty supply of heat to afford them the warmth they needed. Mrs. Green sat holding little Sarah, who was fright- ened by the storm, and kept up a perpetual low wail all the time she was awake; Sammy, who had been poring over a book, by the feeble light of a low tin lamp, .had fallen asleep. Ann went in the afternoon to Elm Hill to recite her lessons, and had not yet returned, although it was past six o'clock. There were no signs of prepar- ation for supper. The sorrowful mother could not put down her idiot child to draw out the table and place the bread and water upon it, which was all the house af- forded. Seeing that little Sammy was asleep, she chose   284      HERE AND HEREAFTER: not to arouse him to do it for her, but soliloquized to herself, "Poor little fellow, he's tired, let him sleep. I wonder where Ann can be, it's bitter cold for her to be out or comin' home in this terrible storm. How the wind roars and shrieks; jest such a night as this my father died of the deliriums. O rum! rum! How could a good God ever let you be made in this world to torment folks so? But I forgot; I said t' other day I'd never fret no more; I 'd have faith like a little child, such faith I suppose as my baby had in me, and as this poor innocent has too, thinkin' the storm won't hurt her if ma has her. Ma is all the word she can say. How wicked in-me to tire hearin' it, when she says it so over and over agin. I 'll try and do better arter this, be patienter with her and Ann, and - Comin', coming jest as quick as I can," she called out, as a loud noise as of cursing was heard at the outer door, and an ineffectual attempt was made to open it. With a fierce oath at the delay, John Green staggered into the room more brutally intoxicated than usual. "Wher, wher, where's the sup-sup-supper - you-- of a foo-ol?" "I could n't put Sarah down, she's so frightened at the storm, and Ann has n't got home yet." "I'll larn her her du-duty - the -- " "Don't, pray don't, John, you scare this poor child. If you won't speak so loud, I can get her to sleep agin, and then I'll- "I 'll st-stop her bl-blab, and you-yourn too, you --" And the wretch seized a small, but heavy wooden chair and hurled it at his wife with such good aim; that it hit her on the side of the head, and knocked the child out of her arms. The blood immediately poured forth in a purple stream, and the poor woman fell senseless   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       285 upon the floor. Sarah had fallen upon the stove, and her light cotton clothes almost instantly took fire. But the inhuman- father heeded her not, nor her piteous cries, but reeling to the bed, he said; "I mea-meant to- to st-stop her" ; and falling upon it, was soon oblivious to the sights and souids of horror around -him. Little Sammy, awakened out of a deep sleep by the confusion, was so terrified by his sister's condition, that. he did not consider whether his mother had been injured or not. Darting to the sink, he seized a pail of water and poured it over the burning child. In doing this, his foot struck against his mother. Supposing her dead, with one wild scream of terror, he rushed from the door to the next tenement, and with face aghast, and- in incoherent ac- cents, implored help. The neighbors came running in, and the tumult and dismay of the scene can be better imagined than de- scribed:. the husband and father insensible on the bed,s his wife fainting, if not dead, on the floor, the poor idiot dripping and smoking too, for the fire was not wholly extinguished, and shrieking at the top of her voice, "Oh, oh, oh! Ma, ma, ma!" while Sammy, with hair erect, face blanched to a deadly whiteness, and trembling in every limb, cowered in a corner, as if to hide the dreadful sight from his eyes. Through the open door came the snow and chill blasts of wind. Dis- order and alarm seem to possess all present. Of the dozens whom the fearful tidings had collected together, no one appeared to know what to do. At that moment Ann entered, her face all flushed and her breath quick and short, as if she had been battling with the elements. In an instant she compre- hended the whole scene, and, turning pale as ashes, she grasped the back of a chair for support. Presently,   286       HERE AND HEREAFTER: however, she revived, and said to an elderly woman near her: "Do, Miss Black, have the house cleared, and," she gasped, pointing to her mother. " send for a doctor." ' Yes, yes," a neighbor broke in, " send for a doctor. That's it; she aint dead yet." "' He did it," said another.. ' There 's the very chair over thllere. It 's a wonder if she gits over tliis." "What a brute, to be sure." Again a refrain of voices arose, which, joined to the wild roaring of the storm without, was terrific to listen to. Ann put her hands to her ears. 'Take them all away," she cried, "or I shall go mad. Only you and Robert stay with me, Miss Black., I will take Sarah." The child was in a stupor. Presently she revived a little, but only to fall into Convulsions; and before an- ' other hour, her little disfigured body was lying beside her mother upon the bed, from which her father a little while before had been taken, still in a state of beastly intoxication, to a place of safe keeping for the night. Dr. Grant, who had been sent for, did not reach the house until after the child was dead. Mrs. Green was still insensible when le arrived, but, under the treat- ment which he ordered, her consciousness soon returned. Putting out her hand as if purposely in that direction, it rested upon little Sarahl's cold forehead. "I knew she was gone," she said, faintly, " and I hoped I was too; O Lord, how long! how long!"  Her words, ut- tered in low and piteous accents, touched the hearts of all present. Mrs. Black's tears fell fast, Dr. Grant turned away to the window, and Ann's eyes filled, but she gave utterance to no word or sound. The following day, John Green was taken before a   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       287 magistrate and sentenced to six months in the house of correction. He was stupid and dogged at the time, and seemed wholly insensible to the disgrace he had brought upon himself and family. When he was told of the death of his child, and the dangerous injury he had in- flicted on his wife, he said he did n't care ; Sarah was a poor fool, and his wife was dreadfully aggravating; lie wished he had made an end of her. In a few days Mrs. Green was about again. But the death-blow had fallen. In a few weeks a severe cough set in, and she pined and pined daily, and, in less than three months, she was laid in her grave beside her three little ones, now surely at rest from the sorrows and suf- ferings of her mortal lot, and in the hands of that Heav- enly Father who, if he appoints the discipline of griev- ous trial to his children, knows when to mete out to them the recompense. Rapid consumption took her away at last; but all who were acquainted with her sad history, knew very well that she was actually murdered by her husband; not alone by that one instance of cru- elty, from the effects of which she never recovered, but by the slower process of harsh words and unkind treat- ment, which, for years, had been her only reward for her labors and sacrifices for him. As truly was John Green the murderer of his wife, as if the blow which he dealt her on that night of horror had proved fatal, as at first it was supposed it had. Many such murderers as he are at large in the commu- nity, and are suffered to go on in their terrible work every day they live with entire impunity, virtually up- held in what they do by an all-powerful public opinion. The law cannot touch them, or seeks not to do it. All legislation hitherto has been found ineffectual in re- straining them from becoming murderers, or preventing -   288       HERE AND HEREAFTER: them from taking the poison into their systems which turns the life-blood in their veins to fire, and the in- stincts of love in their hearts into demoniacal fury. But none the less are they murderers, because they kill not at once but by slow tortures; and because they commit the crimes, of which they stand guilty before the judgment-seat above, when their reason has been made madness by strong drink. Some of the victims of these murderers drag out a wretched existence for a few short years, as was the case with Mrs. Green; and then, when the climax of woe comes in some heavy calamity, droop and die as if hurried out of life by some wasting sickness. Some en- dure longer, and wear a patient, if not cheerful counte- nance all the while; but when at length disease fastens upon them, their exhausted frames and stricken hearts have no power to resist the spoiler, and they fall by the way, apparently long before their time. Others again are murdered with respect to their interests and enjoy- ments in life; finding bitterness, where they had a right to sweetness; met daily by curses, where they had been promised blessings; disappointed in their early hopes, and despoiled of that gladness of heart which once gave joyousness to their countenances, now never lighted up. It is with disgust that we read in classic story of the foul devices of the enchantress Circe, who possessed the terrible art of transforming human beings into grovelling swine, whose delight it is to wallow in the mire; but how much more revolting to our sensibilities is the sight of that hideous transformation which is wrought in-our day in human beings who voluntarily put to their lips a cup whose draught steals away their senses; for no beast that God has created is so low or so vile as the wilful   OR, 'THE TWO ALTARS,       289 drunkard; and no degradation is so great as that to which he consigns himself. When   John Green married Sarah Low, he was a steady, industrious young man, and had a good situa- tion in one of the factories -at N--. His wife was a pretty, energetic girl, with "a heart," as it seemed, ' for any fate "; and she toiled cheerfully day after day without deeming her lot a cruel one, or murmuring at the hardships which she knew must be endured in it. No more tidy figure than hers, in her neat print dress, with her dark hair laid in smooth bands upon her clear forehead, was to be seen. Her floors were always the cleanest, her tins the brightest, her children the health- iest in the neighborhood.  This lasted for six years. Then came a season of commercial' depression which affected the mill interests, and consequently work was slack. Many hands were dismissed, but John still re- tained his place. He had a good deal of leisure time, however, and instead of spending it at home, he got into the habit of joining a knot of idlers, who had a place of common resort not far from the mill yard. He was not long in learning to do what they did, and, be- fore he was aware of it, had become a drunkard and a gambler. At last he went with them almost every night to the house of one of their number, where they carried on their orgies to the utter destruction of their own re- spectability and the ruin of the peace of their families, and, of course, he soon lost his situation. The still young and hopeful wife remonstrated with her husband, and faithfully told him her apprehensions of the result. At first he tried to laugh off her fears, but as entreaty with her turned to reproaches, he be- came angry, and said he knew what he was about, and he would n't have a woman tell him what he should do. 25   290      HERE AND HEIREil TER Up to this time she had but seldom heard him use pro- fane language, but henceforth he scarcely spoke to her without making use of an oath. From this he went to abusing his children, but he never laid a violent hand on her until after the death of little Johnny. Thence- forward it seemed that nothing could restrain him; he sank lower and lower daily, until he became the miser- able, debased creature the events just related represent him. The kindly influences which surrounded Ann Green at Elm Hill had evidently been working a change in her character. Previous to her mother's illness she had be- come remarkably steady and industrious for her. Of course, her habits could not be changed at once - the result of years of indulgence; and besides, she was at that restless agqwhen all restraints are so galling; so she was not ajther a model daughter yet. But so much kindness and goodness of heart did she show, that her mother felfihe had heretofore misjudged her. She told her so, only a short time before her death, and com- mended Sammy to her care and love,- and her father too. " Ann," said the dying woman, " if you love and pity your mother, try and make your father happy when he comes home. Tell him I prayed for him, and died loving him still." Ann afterwards said to Mrs. Norton, that she thougllht it was a little too much for her mother to expect that of her, and then added: C"But I could n't, tell her what was in my heart, she looked so earnest like at me. I'm afraid I most hate my father, and I can't help it nohow. I never know'd how good mother was till lately, but he must have known it always. O dear, Mrs. Norton, was   OB, THE TWO ALTARS.       291 I so dreadful wicked that I could n't see it till she was goin' to die?" "No, Ann, that was not it; but your mother had changed very much within a few months of her deaths and she saw that she had n't taken the best course with you. Now, if you are truly sorry for the trouble you gave her, you must try to comply with her requests." "What! and be good to- to him?" "Yes, Ann, be good to your father. He is your a- ther always, and if you desert him, who will cling to him? When he comaes home, he will be as a broken- down man,-perhaps repentant. Be kind and dutiful, and you don't know what your reward will be." "I 'll try; but, O dear, Hwanted to go to Miss Ellis's to live; she said I might. I sha'n't never be good if I have to stay with him." "You can go to Miss Ellis until your father returns, and then Mrs. Black says she will take you all to board. We are very anxious to try the experiment of kindness upon your father. - Mrs. Black will help you, and you can come here and to lIiss Ellis's often." "Well, I 'll do the best I can for the sake of what mother said to me, but it goes mortally agin the grain." In connection with the preceding events, the following fact relating to Ann may possess some interest. After she had gone through her lessons with Annie Clarke that afternoon, instead of returning home before dark, as she had been advised to do, she loitered in Miss Ellis's kitchen. While she was standing there by: the open wood fire, talking and lahighing with the family domestic, a  gust of wind came which shook the old hlouse and caused the windows to rattle as if the glass would fall out of them, and then it subsided for a mo- ment into a   low, sharp wail, like a sound of mortal *   292      HERE AND HEREATER: agony. Tmmediately the girl, conscience-stricken, prob- ably, at having tarried so long, and suddenly remem- bering, perhaps, how violent her father had been lately, started up, and exclaimed: " O, that 's my mother's voice," and darted out into thie storm with the utmost haste, putting on her hood and shawl as she best could on the way. She never could be persuaded that the sound she heard was not in some way connected with what was occurring at about the same time in her home.   OB, THE TWO ALTARS.       293 CHAPTER XXVIII. "Uncertaint! Fell demon of our fears! The human soul That can support despair, supports not thee."- MALLET. ONE day, as Annie Clarke laid down a letter from her brother James, which she had just finished reading, her ever-watchful friend, Miss Ellis, noticed she sighed heavily. "Is anything wrong with James, Annie?" she asked, tenderly. "With James, aunt? O no, why did you ask?  He is well and happy, and so full of gratitude to Mr. Nor- ton, who, he always says, has been his salvation, and he expects to come home in the spring." And she passed the letter to Miss Ellis, who, after reading it, remarked: "Very satisfactory indeed, this is, Annie; but you drew such a deep sigh as you put it down, I feared you had some cause of anxiety." "Did I, aunt?   It must have been from vexation with myself, then, that I don't feel as happy as I ought, when I  have everythng to make me so. Ought I not to be almost perfectly happy to think that James is doing so well, and has become such a steady and enter- prising man?" "Your interests in life cannot always centre in James alone, my dear; and while you may be happy in and for him, you may have other sources of disquietude. It is what often happens. But keep up good courage, dear 25    294      HERE AND HEREAFTER: child, it is only wrong-doing that makes any one actu- ally miserable. You are in the hands of One who will direct your feet into right paths, if you look to Him for wisdom and instruction." "Yes, aunt, that is my comfort always; but- but -" "Speak, my child; you don't fear me now?" "Fear? O no, no! I only wish to say,- indeed, I have n't anything to say- but--" and the blood rushed to her face and neck in one crimson glow- "Dear aunt, I don't want you to think anybody has been to blame, or that I have been silly without some reason. There's a mistake somewhere, I 'm sure." "A mistake, child? Then let me clear it up." ( O no, no!' You cannot; no one can. I don't know what it is about; only I am sure of it, and you must be too. You cannot doubt him." Touched as Miss Ellis was by Annie's grief and em- barrassment, for an instant the ludicrous aspect of the scene flashed before her mind. "Humph," she thought, "intelligible, him? There is but one him to her in this world. But perhaps I can discover who him is,--How- ard, Duncan, Mr. Hill, Dr. Marston," and -so she said, "Doubt whom, my dear?" ' O aunt, how could I have so betrayed my weak- ness? Don't you know? Don't ask me more, pray don't. You won't say anything to any one--to--to Mrs. Norton-" "No, child, not yet, or-" seeing Annie looked dis- tressed, " not at all, without your permission. Only, Annie, if there is a mistake, your own good sense should tell you it ought to be set right at once." "If it could be; but I don't see how it can, when I have no clew to it." She added, hastily: "If I was   OR, "THE TWO ALTARS.       295 only quite sure I was not mistaken myself, -but no, I was not; I am sure of it." Afterwards, in the solitude of her own room, with burning cheeks and tearful eyes, the single-hearted girl said to herself: "L How could I have betrayed my feel- ings so much? Yet was it not due to so dear a friend?" Still, with thistsorrow and uncertainty at her heart, Annie was by no means unhappy. She had been too early disciplined in disappointment to allow herself, on that account, to sit down and idly fold her hands in selfish musings. It is true, her daily duties sometimes dragged, but they were always faithfully discharged, and in her efforts to promote the happiness of her kind guardian, and improve Ann Green, who sometimes seemed to regard her with a curious look, as if she had her own thoughts about her young teacher, she found her reward in an abiding inward peace. There is no balm so effectual for a wounded spirit as disinter- ested thoughtfulness for others. So, although the vision she had caught of the enchanted land seemed almost like the mirage of Eastern story, she strove, in the fading colors of that illusion, not to be unmindful of the reali- ties which were around her on every side. And with her warm and sympathizing heart she could not, even if she had wished it; for circumstances were about to occur which led to her taking up her abode at Rosedale, and though painful in themselves, were followed :by con- sequences of the greatest moment to her. Every steamer brought Mrs. Norton tidings of her husband, and the cheerful tenor of his letters did much to console her for his unavoidable absence.  Much sooner than such good news had been expected, came   296      HERE AND HEREAFTER : the announcement that he had taken passage in the Pacific, the ill-fated steamer which left Liverpool the twenty-third of January. In one portion of the letter which brought this intelligence, he referred feelingly to his home and the anxieties of his wife with regard to his return at such an inclement and dangerous season. "Home," he wrote, "how my heart beats and bounds almost with boyish delight, as that dear spot rises up before me with all its hallowed associations and tender affections. I doubt if we ever fully realize the value of any blessing, until we lose it temporarily or perma- nently. I believed myself not insensible to my home joys before I left it, but I think all other life never seemed so vapid, so unworthy of being called such, as now, that I am able to contrast it with remembrances of my own dear fireside. Ah, Delia, those who mourn over life as a vale of tears, a succession of disappoint- ments, a mournful procession from the cradle to the grave, cannot have tasted the delights of a Christian home-circle, or they would acknowledge, however griefs may sometimes overshadow them, that its joys far out- weigh its sorrows. And I believe the happier we are here, the more ready we shall be to answer the sum- mons to our home above, since we shall have had such a foretaste of its bliss as will give us a profound assur- ance of its reality. Of course, I refer to that happiness whose source and hope and exceeding great reward is Christ the Saviour. "With regard to your anxieties about me, dearest, remember who is our dependence and very present help in every -time of trouble; remember who it is that saith now, as of old, For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.' For myself, my heart beats quick and strong with the fond hope, almost certainty,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       297 of so soon clasping to my breast all that the world holds most dear to me. And as for the passage you dread so much, I long for it. It will afford me a season of rest, for in my haste to return to you I have a little over- worked my brain, and the idleness of an unseasick voy- age will go far to restore me, so I shall walk into Rose- dale some day with all my old domineering spirit in full force. Tell Mrs. Hart I shall have a half-day at Liver- pool to look up her brother. "God bless you and protect you all, wife, mother, and little ones." "Thank God!" was Madam Norton's fervent ejacula- tion, when the joyous wife read to her the letter from her son. 'L I have had so many anxious partings from Leslie, it was very hard for me to let him go this time, Delia." "And yet you bore it so cheerfully, mother, it has been a good lesson to me." "I tried to bear it cheerfully, my dear, as it was mv duty; but as to lessons, mine have been from you, not yours frolm me. I have felt, since Leslie left us, if any- thing should happen to him on this voyage, how much comfort we should have that we did not harass him with vain regrets, and that our last looks and words were cheerful. I nearly fell back into my old humor when I found he was really going, but your brave bear- ing brought me into the sunshine again." "And yet, mother, how my heart ached while I was making those hurried preparations, and how it has ached since at the separation. I believe, though, I never should have known how truly we are one but for this. It has been almost like rending away part of my life. How incomplete I was without Leslie, I never knew before. Here, Felice dear," as the latter entered,   298      HERE AND HEREAFTER "good news from Uncle Leslie, He has taken passage for home, and will be here- let me see - in about a week." "O good news, good news, how glad I am! Helen, do you hear, beauty? Uncle your papa, is coming home next week. Do you know what it is, pet? We will have an illumination, and rejoicing, and feasting, may n't we, dear Mamma Delia?" "Won't Uncle Leslie's return be a feast in itself, my child?" asked the grateful mother, while her little Helen, in answer to her part of the question, crowed and laughed and clapped her dimpled hands As if perfectly understanding what she was called upon to rejoice in. One thing she did understand, without any question, and that was the magnetic influence of the good tidings in the happy faces that beamed upon her with even more than usual love, How tardily time moved, even to the ever-active mistress of Rosedale, and how those short winter days perversely lengthened out until the first one, came, when the arrival of the Pacific, in New York, might have been expected. When she laid down the paper that evening, and said, with half a sigh, "No news yet," she added, " you know, mother, Leslie wrote we must give the steamer several days grace at this season, but I cannot help feeling anxious. O no,-in three days, at the farthest, I shall certainly look for him." "I declare, I should n't mind encountering some shocking perils at sea or on land for the sake of having a dear wife at home so anxious about me," said Howard Leslie, who had accompanied his brother to N that evening, half laughing and half in earnest. "You would be more cruel than I have ever thought it was in your nature to be, Howard," answered his   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       299 sister-cousin, with some quickness, " if you would in- flict torture on a dear wife at home for such a poor triumph." Howard looked up with some surprise at Mrs. Nor- ton's flushed face, and said, still laughing, ' How can you expect me to talk like an initiated man, Delia? You are unreasonable. When I have a dear wife at home, I 'll not be cruel to her, but rather consider myself 'As rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas, if all their sands were pearl, The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold,' unless she undertook to domineer over me; and then- woe to her!" Mrs. Norton rose and walked the room a moment, and then said, smiling, "I 'm not much of a heroine after all, Howard; I must confess to a disappointment to- night, which has irritated my temper." "You mean, disturbed your nerves, Delia. Fine ladies don't have tempers, but, instead, extremely deli- cate nervous organizations." "I 'm not a fine lady, then, Howard; my temper rises sometimes even as absurdly as you saw." "Your cousin, Mrs. Leonard Fitzroy, is however. I heard from an eyewitness that there was quite a scene enacted at the close of her fancy ball, --one not laid down in the programme, in which she herself had an hysterical attack, and Mr. Fitzroy performed his part, as the injured husband, with great eclat. Husbands, I understand, ,re always injured if their wives have the hysterics." "Is that all you heard, Howard?" "All, or the amount of all. Johnson, my informant, an ardent admirer of Mrs. Fitzroy, by the way, says   300      HERE AND HEREAFTER: that she appeared on the occasion as Rebecca, that her costume was very becoming, and she was very animated, -perhaps a little too much so for the lofty dignity of the Jewess, but very charming, nevertheless. At sup- per he overheard her make some jesting remark to Mrs. Hightop, who personated Cleopatra, which apparently touched Mrs. Consequence's dignity. At that moment, Mr. Fitzroy, by some unaccountable gaucherie, which Johnson says he never knew him    guilty of before, spilled a plate of oyster-soup upon the beautiful Re- becca's dress, which slightly scalded her foot. Jewess as she was, she gave two or three hysterical shrieks, and then the injured man, deeply injured that oyster-soup should presume to scald or his wife suiffer pain, with a savage look, quite at variance with his select terms, suggested to her to retire to change her dress. This she did, and presently returned quite calm but pale, and immediately the party broke up. Johnson says the feeling was, that there was more than met the eye or ear. I presume the trouble was that Mr. Fitzroy was vexed at his wife's speech to Mrs. Hightop, whose good graces he is very anxious to keep in. Commend me to an out-and-out bluebeard. Such a hypocritical tyrant as he I utterly despise. And that was not the first exhibition of his gentlemanly amiability, Johnson says, and he 's pretty clear-sighted." "I am very sorry," was all Mrs. Norton said; but she sat for some time lost in thought, dreading the worst for her cousin's happiness, yet not knowing what she could do to remedy the fast-coming trials, which seemed to be awaiting her in her domestic life. "When   Leslie returns," she at last said to herself, " he will advise me what to do." But day succeeded to day and night to night, with their   OB, THE TWO ALTARS.       301 unvarying round of sunshine and shadow, and still no Leslie, no Pacific, and no tidings of her arrival. More than a week had now elapsed since she was considered due at New York; and though the press assigned vari-L ous reasons for her non-appearance, yet, as satisfactory as they may have been to those who offered them, they could not entirely prevent a pressure of anxiety from weighing down the hearts of expectant friends. Some- thing may have prevented her sailing at the appointed time, or she may have encountered a succession of storms, or she may have put back to Ireland, were among the conjectures hazarded; and it was advised that those having friends on board should be easy with regard to her fate until after the next arrival from England at least. The next steamer came, making her usual passage, but brought no other intelligence with respect to the Pacific than that she left on her regular day. Then almost the whole nation's pulse beat, as that of one man, with apprehension as to what might have become of the noble vessel and the exultant living freight she bore so proudly with her from her distant port. Again conjecture was rife. It was said now, she may have had such severe weather as to have exhausted her supply of coal, and made for the Western Islands; or she may have been disabled in her machinery, and been obliged to depend on her sails; or she may have got into a field of ice, which was bearing her along with it in unwilling bondage, but to be extricated at no very distant period. And then instances of other steamers, which had very much exceeded their time, were adduced. On the dark side of probabilities but little was said by the press; and little need was that there should be; for God only knows the terrible fears about her fate, 26   302      HERE AND HEREAFTER: which agitated the hearts of those having friends on board. O, how the wail of lamentation went throughout the land as time passed on and still no tidings,came! How obstinately some refused to hope, while others clung to the lightest straw of comfort. HIow some cried aloud in their agony, almost accusing Heaven of wanton cru- elty, while others in deep humility prayed for a submis- sive spirit, which it was so hard to feel, tossed as they were from despair to hope, their hearts now rising elate, as on the crest of a mountain wave, now sinking de- spairingly, as if plunged into the cavernous depths of the sea,-the cruel, mocking, treacherous sea! But how was all this long agony of suspense borne by the fond, waiting hearts at Rosedale? Perhaps a few extracts from Mrs. Norton's note-book, during this period of anxiety, will best answer the question. In this book she had kept a daily record-of the principal events of her life since her marriage, and a faithful ac- count of some of her deepest experiences. In her hours of perplexity and grief, she had poured out upon these pages the fulness of those emotions a reserve in her natural disposition would never have permitted her to utter with her lips. Here she had registered the con- tests she had been obliged to wage with herself, which showed that, however among her friends she might pass for the disciplined and perfected Christian, she had no such opinion of her own character, and was still under the necessity, as of old, of maintaining a fierce warfare with besetting sins. So true is it that the nearer one approaches in character to God's beloved, the more sen- sitive does his conscience become to what to others may be considered the most trifling disregard of the Divine will.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       303 CHA PTER XXIX. "Then in life's goblet freely press The leaves that give it bitterness; Nor prize the colored waters less, For in thy darkness and distress, New life and strength they give." - LONGFELLOW. A PEW extracts from Mrs. Norton's note-book previ- ous to the period of her greatest distress on account of her husband, will afford some idea of its general tenor. "June. --First anniversary of my wedding-day. How very gracious has my Heavenly Father been to me the past year.  Truly, my cup runneth over with goodness and mercy; and the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, and my heart overfloweth with sweet peace and contentment. A   bountiful Giver is the Lord our God, and out of the fulness of my heart would I praise Him." July. --This is the first day I  have left my room since the birth of my little George. To thee, O Father, I consecrate him. Wilt thou give us strength to train him up to thy service and honor?  The fulness of a rmother's joy, words cannot express." !"August.--I  have just had a contest with Felice, in which, althoughl she was obedient at last, I feel that she, and not I, was the victor; for my anger was excited against her, and only in love and gentleness is there true supremacy. I had  thought myself better disci- plined than to give way to such unworthy feeling on ac- count of, the perversity of a child, for whom the manner   304      HERE AND HEREAFTER: in which she has been brought up is a sufficient excuse. But I find that necessity is upon me, as upon others, to watch and pray." j uly.-This has been one of the days when God surely grants his children a foretaste of the joys of heaven, when Nature with her balmiest airs and in her most perfect repose is in unison with that serenity of spirit which is sometimes enjoyed on this earth. In the exceeding stillness of this summer's day, I feel that I can almost hear the song of the redeemed as they chant praises to God and the Lamb. Why are such seasons so rare? Why! Simply because earth is not heaven, and man is not an angel." "October.--I have met with ingratitude from one from whom I had a right to expect different treatment, and for a season I have scarcely been able to restrain my indignation. But when I remember my own ingratitude to Him who' bestoweth all things, I find I have little cause to complain. I am learning slowly, it is true, but I hope effectually, that if we try our own hearts and prove ourselves, we shall feel little inclination to judge others." "January, 1856. -Joy, joy! In one week Leslie will be at home. In thanksgiving do I lift up my heart to thee, O God!" "February.--Six days have passed since the Pacific was due, and though the papers and my friends say there is no cause for apprehension, yet this throbbing heart will not be still. The ship is lost! lost! is evermore my feel- ing about her.. O God, give me strength to endure whatever thou seest fit to send upon me!" ," Febriuary.--The next steamer has arrived, but no tidings from the Pacific,-none! What a gloomy pall is settling down over my heart. O this suspense! how can    OR,- THE TWO LTARS.       305 bear it? Is this the same fair world of three weeks since? I try to pray, but this torture of uncertainty will not suffer either words or thoughts to ascend upward to God. And my friends speak to me of hope. Hope! There is none for my desolate soul; and yet can I live without it?' " March. - O thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt? These words I repeat over and over again with my lips, but my heart responds not. If Leslie, my Les- lie, could only have died at home, then I could have been with him in his last hours, and received his part- ing breath, and known that all that love and skill can do was done for him,--then methinks I could have been resigned. But now, to think of what his probable fate was, -he yielding up his last breath in the agony of that wrestling with the cold, cold waters, bearing up to heaven wife and child and home, as his last thoughts, while we were sitting at ease and in happiness at our quiet fireside. And then, how he longed to be at home once more! And this,- this is the end. O Leslie, my Leslie! shall I never, never hear the sound of thy voice again,--that voice whose accents have ever been so gentle, so tender, so strengthening?" 'd March. - And this is my ' hill of difficulty.' Fain would I turn aside from this rugged path and seek an easier road, but that, torpid as my soul seems, it is not yet quite dead to truth and right. Still the days wear on, and still no news, and now almost my heart tells me that this house is desolate; that nevermore will its walls echo to the sound of 'his glad voice. I think if I only knew the truth, I could be calm; but now, to lie down at night with this heavy load of uncertainty upon me; to awake in the morning with the same feeling; to have faint gleamings of hope only to be succeeded by 26'   306      HERE AND- HEREAFTER: deeper shades of despondency, seems more.-than I can bear. And yet I know it is written, ' Cast thy burden on the Lord, and he will sustain thee.' If I knew what my burden was,-O, if I only knew! But peace, rebel- lious heart! Is it for thee to mark out thy path, and say if it led here or diverged there, I would uncom- plainingly walk in it? It is for thee to walk whither- soever God wills, and in the way of his choosing. 0 Lord, strengthen me and uphold me!" "March. -- I have been down into ' the valley of hu- miliation,' and now my eyes are opening, and I begin to catch glimpses of the green pastures and pure waters once more, which have so long been hidden from my view. Out of this recent terrible conflict, when it seemed for a season that I had all along been leaning upon a broken reed, which at the first heavy pressure gave way and left me prostrate in the dust, I am at last emerging, wounded, sore, and weary, but still living." "March. - I have been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The trials and afflictions with which hitherto I have been visited, though very sore, were not like this. O, what other trial can be like this! So long as God left me my strongest hold upon earth I was sub-. missive, but he requires an undivided homage, and that his children shall not say, ' This, Father, will I bear, that will I endure, if thou wilt leave me my one great treasure.' But there are seasons when the voice of love will not prevail, - when God, the loving, tender, long- suffering Father, whose pleadings and clemency have been all in vain, asserts his might and majesty, and says, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' This word came to me as I groaned in agony of spirit, unmindful of His love, unmindful of his compassion, and I was subdued, and now out, of my exceeding great darkness   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       307 light begins to dawn. So soon as I yielded to Him in faith and resignation, he granted to me peace; and now I feel that he doth never willingly afflict or grieve his children; that ' weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning'; that if my Leslie never re- turns to me, I may -go to him; that life has yet its duties, and, O my darling Helen! its pleasures too. I believe I can almost say, ' Thy will, O God, be done!" '"March. -How some great calamity shows to one's self his true character. Here have I been in selfish grief, forgetting the sorrows of my much afflicted moth- er, who in Leslie has lost her all Iof this earth; and in the mean time the affectionate sympathy of my little Felice has been repressed; and I have been irritable and unkind, where I should have been forbearing and gentle. Thou, who forgivest all our iniquities, forgive me this great sin." "March. - Since Duncan's sad accident, and the fearful consequences which threatened for a time to fol- low it, I have endeavored once more to lay aside my old s elfish sorrow. How much I have felt for him in this new trial to his faith! But he is spared to us in his pure life and Christian example; and as for me, it re- mains to labor while it is yet to-day, that when my summons comes it may find me prepared as was my beloved for his. Indeed, I have still many causes for gratitude. I never knew I had so many kind friends before. And my little Helen, with all her winning ways and her daily increasing loveliness, is the greatest com- fort to me, while Felice, with the gentle tenderness of a woman's thoughtfulness, makes every effort to console me. Shall I shut my eyes to these very great blessings because he is not? Duncan is pronounced out of dan- ger. Bless the Lord, O my soul! To-day the Psalm-   308      HERE AND HEREAFTER: ist's hopeful words have been constantly in my thloughts: ' Why art thou cast down, O my soul? why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.' " "March.- O, how shall I find words to express my gratitude. I had just schooled and prayed myself into resignation, and now comes this too, too happy news. O heart, whose pulses did not cease from grief, throb not so wildly from joy. And yet my Leslie may have found a grave among strangers, but I feel that he has been spared to me."

"How beautiful she looked! her conscious heart Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong; O Love, how perfect is thy mystic art, Strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong!" - BYRON. ONE evening in February, in one of the severest storms of the season, Annie Clarke sat by the library fire at Rosedale, where she had been writing a letter to her brother, and pouring out to him from her full heart an account of the terrible agony of suspense which they were all enduring; for she had come to Mrs. Norton 'at once in her trouble. It was late, and the other members of the household had long since retired. Her letter had been some time finished, but still she sat there apparently lost in thought. Perhaps, as she gazed at the mouldering ashes on the hearth, she was reflect- ing on the uncertainties of a mortal lot, and upon the probable fate of him, the light of that family circle, now gone out for ever, as all felt; perhaps she was thinking of some of the trials of her own young life, finding in those dying embers an emblem of the hopes she had once indulged, but which were now fading away day by day; or, it may be, she was striving to fathom some of the mysterious perplexities of an earthly existence, which were meeting her at every side. Whatever her medita- tions were, however, they did not in the least mar the sweetness of her expressive face. At length a fierce raging of the blast, which rattled the blinds and seemed to shake the silent house to its   310      HERE AND HEREAFTER: very foundations, aroused her from her reveries, and she arose and went to -the window, and opening a shut- ter, looked out. The moon was struggling through a heavy mass of clouds to shine out on the snow-covered hills and valleys. As she put up her hand to shade the light in the room, she saw a figure moving with the ut- most difficulty towards the side-door and beckoning to her. In an instant it flashed upon her mind that it was Duncan Leslie, who had not come out in the early even- ing train, and who, Howard said- for he now came to Rosedale almost every night - had probably gone home to R--. This Annie doubted at first, but as the last train had been due more than an hour, and he had not arrived, she concluded that it must be so, although under the circumstances she thought it very strange. She hastened to the door and unfastened it to admit Dun- can, for it was he; but he was unable to move from where she first saw him, and was upon the point of sinking down with exhaustion. She rushed into the snow to his side to assist him. ," O Duncan, O Mr. Leslie," she cried out in alarm, "what has happened? Are you injured? What shall I do? Can I help you?" "Yes, if you please; I have walked a mile in these drifts," almost gasped the wearied young man, tremb- ling with agitation as well as from suffering, ' and I fear I have badly lamed myself. Oh!" and a suppressed cry of agony burst from him as he was about to sit down. Annie assisted him into the library and on the couch, where she left him, to seek for camphor; for he looked so ghastly by the shaded lamp she feared the worst consequences. When she returned, he had fallen back in a dead swoon. Having often seen Mr. Ellis in sim-   OR, THE TWO ATTARS.      3^ ilar turns, she thought she knew how to manage the case, and would not alarm the house, and she did not dare to leave him in his present state to call tHoward. But in vain did she rub his hands and forehead, speak- ing to him in the mean time in the most tender accents. At last, as he gave no signs of returning animation, she concluded he must be dead. "O my God," she exclaimed in tones of beseeching entreaty, and falling upon her knees beside him, ( spare him! Oh!!" she added, still chafing his icy hands, "was it all a dream? Did he never love me, and is this the cruel end? Dead! dead! Mrs. Norton, Mr. Leslie," she essayed to cry, but only a faint sound came from her lips. "No, he is not dead, Annie," said Howard, who had entered unobserved. "He often had such attacks when he was a boy. Don't tremble so. If you will prepare a little camphor and water, I think we shall be able to restore him without calling any one else at present, unless indeed, you are unequal to it," he added quietly, seeing how pale she looked. Recovering herself, Annie answered:  O yes, I am quite equal to it now. I feared he was dead, he has  been in this state so long." Howard put some of the camphor between his faint- ing brother's lips, and deputed Annie to the hall for shawls in which to wrap his lower limbs, and then the two continued the rubbing together. In a few minutes Duncan gave signs of returning consciousness, and mur- muring, "Annie! Is she here? I thought an angel rescued me." "Yes," said Howard, "Annie is here ; and that is a far greater boon than you deserve, after risking life and limb as you have done to-night. There, don't speak,   312      HERE AND HEREAFTER: but sit still and obey orders. I will go for Ferris to help you up stairs, if you think you will be able to bear it, by the time a fire has been lighted in your chamber. I will take care of you myself; for if Delia is asleep, it would be cruel to arouse her in such a night as this." While Howard was gone, Annie was kneeling on the hearth, trying to coax the fire to blaze again. Presently Duncan said faintly, "Thank you, Annie, I should have died at the door but for you." "Don't speak of it, Mr. Leslie. Indeed, don't speak at all; you must not." As Howard at that moment entered, "I will call Susan," she continued, (a middle- aged woman, who filled various gaps in the Rosedale household,) "for you will need her, Mr. Leslie. Is there anything more that I can do?  "No, thank you," said Howard. "You have done everything already." Following her to the hall, he added in a low tone of deep feeling: "You have saved my brother's life this fearful night. Let that thought give you sweet sleep. Why, Delia, I hoped we should not disturb you," he said, turning to Mrs. Norton, who was coming down stairs, her crimson dressing-gown af- fording a strong contrast to her pale face. "Do you suppose, Howard, I can sleep on such a night as this?" she asked, almost reproachfully. After having seen her invalid cousin safely and com- fortably in his own room, Mrs. Norton and Annie retired to theirs, but not to sleep; for although the bereaved wife was beginning to view her affliction more calmly, she could not lie down and compose herself to quiet slumbers on such a night,-just such an one, perhaps it was, when Leslie met his doom in the wild waters; and as for Annie, Duncan's words when he came out of his swoon, and the look she caught when he first recognized   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      313 her, had spoken volumes to her heart, and long after she had laid her head upon her pillow, did she ponder them, feeling half guilty the while that she should have any experiences of joy where there was so much sorrow. But Annie Clarke had no occasion to reproach herself long for this feeling. Upon descending to a late break- fast the next morning, she was informed that Duncan was in a high fever, and that Dr. Grant, whom Howard called an hour previous, was quite anxious about him. On that night of perilous adventure, Duncan had missed the usual train to N , and not knowing that his brother had gone out, waited to take a later one, notwithstanding the fury of the storm was increasing every moment, and it was very doubtful if it could get through. About a mile from the way-station in N near Rosedale, the passengers were obliged to leave the cars on account of the obstructions on the track, and make their way to their several homes through bluster- ing and drifting snow, as best they could. For stout and healthy men this was no easy thing to do; but for Duncan, it was almost as much as his life was worth. His hip, from a difficulty in which he had suffered in early youth, was so wrenched and injured by the effort, that it was probable he would be lame for some time. But his greatest danger was the violent cold he had taken, which had settled upon his lungs, and he was threatened with a severe if not fatal sickness. Sad news was this for poor Annie Clarke, and sad news for the generous-hearted Howard to carry home to father and mother. Duncan's fever run high, and for more than a week he was the greater part of the time delirious. In his wan- derings he asked constantly and imploringly for Annie. When she came into the room, as she often did at the 27 f    314      HERE AND HEREAFTER: request of his mother, he did not appear to recognize her. Once he waved her away with his hand, saying, "Begone, ignis fatuus that thou art! Wouldst thou lure another and still another to destruction?" For days the life of this sensitive poet-youth seemed to hang on a thread; and anxious faces and sorrowing hearts went about the house at Rosedale, striving to catch some gleam of comfort from Dr. Grant's look and manner as he made his frequent visits. At length, how- ever, the crisis came, and from the very edge of the grave a merciful God raised up the young man, to the unspeakable joy of his many friends. After he was pronounced out of danger, so feeble was he that his physician gave the strictest orders with regard to his treatment, and especially that he should not be made the subject of any excitement, for his -nerves were in such a state that a relapse would prove fatal. His life, he told them, depended upon his nurses, under Provi- dence, and not upon his physician. After he was able to sit up a few hours daily, his mother, observed a restless uneasiness in his manner, unusual to him at other periods of ill-health, and re- marked upon it one day to Howard. "Has he seen Annie Clarke, or spoken of her? was the quick inquiry of the brother. "Neither," was the answer; " and under the circum- stances, which are of a very delicate nature, I don't know what course to take. He loves Annie, poor fellow, that was evident enough in his ravings, and ydt he has never spoken of his love, Delia tells me. Do you, How- ard, know anythiing about it? Has Duncan made you a confidant in the matter?" '"No, mother." Then, after a short pause, he added: "I know something about it, however, and I will speak,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       15 painful as it is for me. Duncan thinks, I imagine, that I --I too love Annie, and he is so noble and self-sacri- ficing, that he will not be my rival." 'Alnd is it so, my son?" asked the mother, with commiseration in her tones. "It was so, mother," answered Howard, bravely, "but, I trust, no longer. At least I have so far con- quered my feelings, that I can see Annie happy with my brother, and not suffer--so very much." "My noble boy! and this your first cloud comes in this form does it? But Annie, are you sure that she prefers Duncan to you?" "Sure, mother; always nearly so, since I discovered his interest in her; now quite so." "But why this reserve on either side? Why has not your brother assured himself of her love long be- fore this?" "I don't know, mother; I would not come here, that he might have the opportunity, and I have made only the most unmistakably friendly calls at Miss Ellis's all winter; still he has not explained himself, and I fear will not until  Mother," with a sudden change of manner like that of a. person wrought up to the deter- mination of undergoing a painful operation, "I will speak to him,-I must." "But to agitate him. You know the doctor's orders." "Yes; but the doctor does n't wholly understand his case, or he would at once say that an explanation was the best medicine he could have. I will take the re- sponsibility, and delay going to town until the next train." "Well, if you think it best, my son." "I do, I know how much good it would do me in like circumstances." o   316      HERE AND HEREAFTER: And Howard turned and ran quickly up to his brother's room, as if fearful his resolution might give way, while his mother followed and went into an adjoin- ing dressing-room.  "Come, Duncan," said Howard in a tone of gayety, quite strange of late in that house, "we must not play at hide-and-seek any longer. I have come to be- your * father-confessor, and you must make a clean breast of it. Tell me why, since your malady is leaving you, you don't become your own old, patient, quiet, cheerful self again? And more, why do you watch that door, or start so violently, whenever it is opened unexpectedly? You see I've watched you; now tell- me your disease, or I will turn conjurer and tell it to you." Duncan attempted to smile, but it was a sad failure, and he said: "Ay nerves are shattered in consequence of my great exposure and sickness, I suppose, Howard. Is it a light thing to see the improvement of years in one's constitution and strength destroyed in a single night? But you, who have both health and strength, don't know what it is." "Nonsense, my boy; you 'll be as strong as ever in  the spring, hip and-all." "No, no, impossible." Howard became quite grave. 'Don't attempt any such poor pretence as that with me. My heroic broth- er has become a complainer! Duncan, I know how it is, and what now is your chief trouble. Why, since you love Annie Clarke, and she loves you, have you not come to an understanding with her before this?" ' "Annie loves me, Howard? No, no. You must not say that; you have no right to." "Have I not a right to, my faint-hearted brother? Did n't I come down stairs that night, when you were   ORB, THE TWO ALTARS.      317 lying unconscious on the couch in the library, and find her kneeling at your side, everyfeature of her beautiful face convulsed with agony, and uttering words which nothing but the deep desolation of her heart could ever have forced from her, for she supposed you were really dead?; Don't I know that she loves you, Duncan? I do know it, and believe me, dear brother, kind com- panion of all my young days, I speak truth when I say, I rejoice that she does." "O Howard, you cannot mean what you say, --I you-" "; Yes, Duncan, I did love her, and could have loved her to the end, but I discovered that she had given her heart to another; consequently my conflict has been less sore, and, let me add, wiser, than yours; for you, Duncan, have been striving to sacrifice yourself, while you had good reason for believing that Annie was in- terested in you. Is n't it so?" "Yes, Howard, in a degree, but I was not certain. But I could n't endure the thought of your giving up this- Aer love to me, when all your life you have been so kind and self-denying. Then I considered, too, how much more secure her happiness would be with you than with me." ' But you forget, over-considerate brother, that An- nie's love never was mine to give up. And," he added, in his old lively tone, for the interview was becoming too painful to him on account of the intensity of his feelings, " as I suppose it would be impossible to con- vince the young lady herself of her folly and bad taste in preferring you to me, and since ' Love's reason 's without reason,' why then we 'll say no more about it. Only," he added, seeing his brother still looked at him with a wistful, anxious face, " remember this, Duncan,- 27*   318      HERE AND HEREAFTER: I shall conquer this bravely, and live to call Annie sister, with a true brotherly feeling, and give you some years hence a sister in return. So now good by, my boy, and lie down to rest awhile, and before the sun goes down give rest to that troubled heart of yours likewise." "O Howard, how noble and generous you are; and how you put to shame my self-complacency in my de- termined martyrdom! But I must see Annie this morn- ing; will you ask mother to bring her to me? I call- not endure this terrible suspense any longer." Although surprised at this request, Howard made it known to his mother, who went immediately in pursuit of Annie. Mrs. Leshe was no manoeuvrer. While she took a woman's interest in all sincere love-making, and particularly so in that of her-own son, who, on account of the gentleness of his disposition and the delicacy of his health, had filled almost a double place in her affec- tions, yet she did not consider whether in his case it was proceeding after the most approved rules or not, or whether the part 'she was taking in it would bring upon her the accusation of intermeddling in an affair in which the young lovers should have been left to manage for themselves as they best could. She was quite certain that her son loved Annie Clarke and that she loved him, and she saw no good reason why there should not at once be an understanding between them, and two miserable beings be made happy. Consequent- ly, as soon as she found the object of her 'search, 8she simply said: "My dear, Duncan wishes to speak with you. If you can give him hope, I know you will. Will you go to him?" Annie laid down her work, and saying simply, ": will," while the warm blood rushed to her cheek, fol- lowed Mrs. Leslie. Duncan was sitting by a window, *    OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       319 his pale but expressive countenance lighted up by the bright winter's sun. When Annie entered, he made an effort to rise. "No, no, do not," she said; 1' I will come to you." He extended his thin, white hand, and she put hers into it. He held it lightly for an instant and then tightening. the pressure and looking into her beautiful young face with his heart shining out of his poet-eyes, he said: "May it be so always, Annie? Hand in hand, heart beating in unison with heart, shall we walk through life together, Annie, dearest Annie?" For a moment the deep fringes drooped over her hazel eyes, and then, raising them with a look of blush- ing happiness, she answered: "If you wish it." "If I wish it, Annie? Don't you know I have always wished it since our first meeting in Pine Grove?" "No, I do not," she answered, simply. , But since the children's picnic in the wood, - you must have been aware of it since then? I thought heart spoke to heart there, when, leaning against the leafless old tree, and treading the fallen foliage under our feet, we both agreed that true life was independent of cold and frost and dying years, that the heart knew nothing of the dreariness of such changes. I felt, I hoped, you understood me then; but I was too presumptuous." "No, not that, but since - " ' Yes, I know. A cruel mistake occurred, in which, however, I was most to blame. That mistake was and is another's secret. You trust me?" "Most unreservedly." "Now and ever? That is the true basis of all happi- ness -earthly or heavenly. You will tell Delia; heavy as her own sorrow is, she will rejoice with us. Moth- er," as Mrs. Leslie now came in from the dressing-room,   320      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "here is another claimant upon your love," at the same time placing Annie's hand in hers and watching with rapturous delight the welcome with which she received her heart's daughter, as she called her. A little later, when his mother came in to assist him in lying down, Duncan said, in allusion to what had occurred: - "If it were not for Howard and poor Delia, I should be too happy." "Howard will not suffer long, child. He knows Annie has never loved hm." "I trust he will not. It is painful to me to think of purchasing so much happiness at the expense of such a noble fellow. As for Delia-, mother, I believe her trials will soon be over. I have a strong feeling Leslie will come back to us again." J ,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       821 CHAPTER XXXI. ' The weary lapsing time still lengthens out, Till, with one dawn, there comes an hour of gladness, That swells the pulse of joy almost to madness." -A. D. T. W. THE last extract from Mrs. Norton's note-book inti- mated that her husband might still be safe. One day Mrs. Hart came to see her, and upon being ushered into her chamber, where she was reclining on a couch suffer- ing from a severe headache: "News for you, ma'am,',' exclaimed the warm-hearted woman, " but I don't know whether it 's good or bad. You see I got a letter from my brother, and I've come right up to tell you what it is." "News of my husband?" gasped Mrs. Norton, rising at once. '"Yes, ma'am, yes; he did n't sail in the Pacific- but " '"O, tell me all at once, do, Mrs. Hart! Let me see." "I 'll read it, ma'am. Hugh 's a poor writer; he never took to larning, no ways. That 's it, and do you know it 's been all this time in New Lonnon." "O, read it, Mrs. Hart, do!" implored Mrs. Norton. "That I will, ma'am." The letter was as follows:-  "Iiverpoole jan. monday "DEAR SISTER "this is to you to inform Miss Norton how her man is tuk sick with brane fefer,' and so, as he' didnt sale in   322       HERE AND HEREAFTER: the steemer the Sargun mr hallam says i must rite to u. i an sally, we tales good kare of him as we nows hou to, mr hallam ses he's desprate sic but he recons he'll git thro. plese informe liis wife how tis. - ise glad to here u is alive, sorry u is a widder, shall send some money by mr norton wen he gits well, will take your little sonne an bring him npp likes mi own. good by you fectionate brother - HUGH oIMORIARTY." ' Sick! brain fever! did not sail in the Pacific! What is the date?" cried Mrs. Norton, faint from the excess of joy which this letter gave her. '"There aint no date at all, ma'am, jest you see. I'm ashamed of Hugh, only glad to hear this news; but it 's been layin' in New Lonnon this many a day, and the way I heard of it was curus enough. You see I went to town last week and I see an old acquaintance of mine, and she said to me: ' Have you got your let- ter? ' C What letter? ' says I. ' Why, the letter that came in the steamship.' C No,' says I.  'Well,' says she, c there's one in New Lonnon Post for you, sure, and I 'll tell the office man to send it here.' So I gin her the money to pay for it, and so I jest got it and come right up to you." "May I keep it, Mrs. Hart? and will you call at Mr. Howe's on your way home and tell him, and say I should be glad to see him?" "That I will,-Miss Norton. You can keep the letter jest as long as you likes, though it is n't writ in a larned manner. Thinks I, when I got it, if Mr. Norton aint alive, that 's better news than the other way, so I come." And the good woman bustled off with evident satis- faction at the result of her communication.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       323 As soon as she was alone, Mrs. Norton obeyed the first impulse of her grateful heart to throw herself upon her knees and thank God for this good tidings; for, as Mrs. Hart had remarked, good tidings it was, whether her husband was living or dead; for now, at least, she could hear of his last hours, if such had been, and know that his remains rested in a grave. But her heart beat high, and she was very hopeful. Leshe was still living. Leslie would be restored to her. A good God had not saved him from perils by sea that he might die in a foreign land among strangers. Summoning her kind friends, she read to them the letter. "I feel that Leslie will return to us, my child," said Madam Norton, after hearing it. "God is gracious and merciful." And they sat and talked and speculated with regard to his disease, and the probable length of time that would elapse before he could write himself, a more cheerful family circle than they had been for weeks. At length Mr. Howe was announced. His ever-ready sympathies went out to this agitated household, and lis kind words soothed their excited feelings; but while he allowed that they had reason for hope, he would have them consider that it was high time to hear from Mr. Norton himself upon the next arrival from Liverpool. Duncan was one of those whose trust all along had been stronger than their fears, and when Howard re- turned at- night, he too was sanguine. '"The steamer will arrive some time to-night," he said, C and we shall have our letters to-morrow." To-morrow came, though it seemed to the impatient household that it never would, so long were the tardy hours; but come it did at last, and Howard left for the city with confidence in his heart and a cheerful cordial-   324      HERE AND HEREAFTER: ity in his manner, which was a great comfort to the still hopeful wife. At an early hour he returned, and as the door was opened to admit him, he shouted, "Joy! joy! a letter from Leslie in his own handwriting!" Like an electric thrill the glad news quickened every pulse and enlivened every breast. Mrs. Norton met him- at the head of the stairs, and seizing the letter and break- ing it open, with tearful eyes she read its contents, which were brief, and as follows: - "DEAREST WIFE: -- "I am in a state of terrible doubt and perplexity. I fear you have not received a letter Mr. Hallamn wrote you at my request, as he thinks he made a mistake in the address, for my mind was very much confused at the time. O, sweet wife, very near to the dark valley have I been ;- but God has spared me, and I have faith that he will still spare me and protect me on my voyage home to you. "Will not our meeting be a thanksgiving of the heart to the Lord our God for his loving-kindness and tender mercies? His ways are not as our ways. But I must not write any more, I am still so feeble. How much you must have suffered on my account! My good phy- sician will not give his consent to my taking passage in  the next steamer. "Put- your trust in Hin, dearest, who has been so merciful to us. O the probable sad, sad fate of that noble ship!! "Though the ocean divides us, my love embraces ypu all, my dear ones." This joy proved too great for the enfeebled system of the young wife. After reading the letter, she ex-   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       325 claimed: "Thank God! I did not deserve this after all my murmuring," and immediately sank back into a chair in a swoon. As soon as she was sufficiently re- covered she was assisted to her own room and laid upon her couch, and left with Annie Clarke to watch at her side in .case of a return of faintness. In a few minutes she dropped into a quiet slumber, and slept for more than an hour. When she awoke, Annie was bending over her, not sad or anxious, however, but with a radiant countenance expressive of unusual pleasure. "Am I awake, Annie?" she inquired, looking up almost bewildered. "'What is it? What has hap- pened? I thought Leshe was here. I remember now, I had a letter. That should be joy enough for one day." "Can you bear more joy, the greatest you can ever experience?" asked Madam Norton, who at that mo- ment entered. "More joy, mother! - more joy!  O, what can it be?" "Let me," cried out the little Felice. ' O, you said I might tell Mamma Delia the good, good news. Uncle Leslie, he is come! O, he is come!" As Mrs. Norton sprang from her couch she was en- folded in the strong arms and clasped to the loving heart of her husband. All was soon explained. ]Mr. Norton's letter was written two days previous to the sailing of the steamer, and in that time he had gained so considerably, and his convalescence appeared so promising, that his physician gave a reluctant consent to his taking passage in her. He was so fortunate as to obtain the place of a friend who was detained unexpectedly by business, and by other friends he was kindly cared for on the voyage. 28   326      HERE AND HEREAFTER: Soon after Howard Leslie arrived at his place of busi- ness that morning, Mr. Norton walked into his count- ing-room, not wholly unexpected to the ever sanguine young man, and a few minutes later the letter, which was the cause of so much joyful excitement at:Rosedale, was brought in. Upon consultation between the two cousins, it was thought to be the more judicious course for Howard to precede Leslie to N--  with the letter, so that the household might be in a measure prepared for the happy surprise so soon to follow. As it has been seen, they judged wisely. While Mrs. Norton was lying on her couch in the unconscious sleep of exhaustion her husband arrived home. A few words will explain the causes of Mr. Norton's illness and consequent detention in Liverpool. Al- though he was a strong and healthy man, in his ardent haste to finish up the business that called him abroad he had overworked his brain, and when he left London for Liverpool, it was with some misgivings with regard to his health. Contrary to his expectations, he was able to get only a half-day at the latter place previous to the steamer's departure. His first impulse was to go im- mediately on board to try the effect of quiet upon the unpleasant sensations of his head, but remembering his promise to Mrs. Hart, and reasoning as his habit was that he should never be the worse for performing a good deed, he went in search of her brother, whom without much difficulty he found at his own house. By this time he was suffering a most excruciating headache. He was only able to give Hugh Moriarty a somewhat confused account of his sister and her circumstances, when he requested him to send for the nearest physi- cian; and immediately after he became delirious. The physician called, Mr. Hallam, pronounced his   OR, THJE TWO ALTARS.      327 patient's sickness to be brain-fever, and upon suggesting his removal to some other place, Hugh begged that lhe might be allowed to remain with them, promising that he and his wife would take faithful care of him. It so happened that there was nothing upon Mr. Nor- ton's person by which his place of residence could be ascertained, and the cabman had been suffered to de- part without any one asking him from what hotel he brought his passenger. To Mr. Hallam's inquiry with respect to the place of residence and friends of the sick man, Hugh answered: " He came from New Lonnon, sure, in the United States, for that is where my sister lives, and I shall jest write to her all about him." What the result was has been seen. Matters were not any improved by the letter written by Mr. Hallam at a later day. Consequently in all this time friends at home were suffering most intensely from  suspense; sus- pense now, however, so happily ended. As the household at Rosedale that evening gathered around the family altar, not one eye was dry, as the -restored husband, son, and father lifted up his voice in praise and thanksgiving to that Almighty Preserver, who had brought them together again ! Yes, Leslie Norton was once more safe- in his own home; and the joy which filled all hearts can only be appreciated by those who have undergone a similar trial of their faith.  But the Pacific! where was she and the living freight she bore when she left the shores of Old England,-where ? Echo for ever and ever answereth, Where? God alone knoweth, for to man it was never revealed. Whether by the terrible fate of fire at sea, where the two fierce    eeme'nts combated for their vic- tims; whether by the slower torture of the gradual sinking of the disabled vessel, when all around on wild  328      HERE AND HEREAFTER: ocean's waste there was no help, none; whether where one instant all had been peace and repose, and the next the towering ice-mountain with an angry, crashing shock had borne the noble ship and all her wealth of human lives to ocean's depths, they met their doom, God alone knoweth, who in his inscrutable wisdom permitted this great calamity! What salutary discipline the lessons taught by this dis- pensation has imparted to the tortured hearts of sur- viving relatives and friends, He also alone knoweth! Whether to any came the conviction, as they mourned the loss of husband or wife or parent or child, that they hitherto had been more anxious to lay up treasure on earth than in heaven, or that the wealth, honor, and po- sition they had hitherto valued so highly were now proved to be vanity of vanities as they were weighed against their afflictions; whether they mourned in sub- mission and faith, or cried aloud in a rebellious spirit; whether they kissed the rod that chastened them, or hardened their hearts against their Maker,-he alone knoweth, for he is able to read the inmost thoughts and feelings of his children!   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       829 CHAPTER XXXII. "So writhes the mind remorse hath riven, Unfit for earth, undoomed for heaven, Darkness above, despair beneath, Around it flame, within it death." - BYRON. "4TAKE care there, man! Don't you see that poor creature is unable to move, and you are backing your dray directly upon him?" "No business there, the drunken fool! Why don't the police take him away? I can't wait here for all such trash. Time's money- in this country, mister, whatever it be out in Indy, where you come from. Here, git out of that, old shaky, can't ye; or I'll drive right over ye!" And the drayman gave a poor, wretched wreck of -humanity, who was lying upon the pier, a thrust with the butt-end of his whip-handle so roughly that he cried out, "O don't, man alive! I fell down and can't git up again. Jest you give me a helpin' hand, Don't you see I 's lame?" "The plague take you," replied the other, "what business have you here with your old hulk, stoppin' up the way jest as we are gittin' out the freight of this ere Indyman?" "I tell you I fell down, and can't git up. Jest you lend an old feller a helpin' hand and I 'll go treat. I 've got the money. You jest find out if there's a gentleman named Clarke come passenger in the Clypso; if he did, and you 'll bring me to speak of him, I 'll give you an 28*   330      HERE AND HEREAFTER: X.- If you can't find him, then you jest help me home to   Street, Miss Bright's lodgin'-house, and I 'll make all right." "You don't come it over me, old fox," with a glance of surly contempt at the mean and ragged appearance of the old man, " unless you 're an old ragamuffin of a miser. Now be you one?"  "A miser, hey! a miser!" shrieked the old man; "not I, you chap. All the misers I ever knowed come to some bad end. Some on 'em was murdered in their  i beds, some on 'em died of fright, and some on 'em all but starved to death. Oh! Oh!" This last exclamation was occasioned by a blow upon the side of the head from a heavy trunk a porter was carelessly handling, which felled the old man to the earth again. "Guess you-'re done for now, old fellow," exclaimed the drayman, " and won't find your Mr. Clarke this time." "What were you saying?" asked a tall, fine-looking young man, whose dress and bronzed complexion be- tokened him as one of the passengers in the good ship Calypso, and who, following the porter with the trunk, came along just as the old man fell. The drayman re- peated the remark, with the addition of the request that had been made of him, concluding with, "But I want to see him lay down the tin before I undertake a job of that sort for such an old scarecrow. A bird in the hand, you know, sir. Look out for number one, I say." "At least, sir," replied the other, authoritatively, "help me lift him and put him into yonder carriage. You shall be paid for your trouble." That's what I call sensible," replied the drayman,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       331 "not expecting a feller to do a job for nothin' in this here country where time is money." With some difficulty the poor creature, now almost insensible, was lifted up and put into the carriage. The young man, after ascertaining where his lodging- house could be found, got in with him. It was a sin- gular position for a wanderer to be placed in upon his first arrival in his native land, after three years' absence, and from the anxiety with which he regarded his scarcely conscious-companion, it was quite evident that his interest in him was not wholly a benevolent one. "If it should prove to be so," he said to himself;" but it cannot be. Yet the name and the description the old woman gave me tallies well with this man's appearance. It may be, that a good Providence has ordered that my innocence shall be fully established, just at the time that I am returning home under such different circum- stances from those under which I went away.", Arrived at the lodging-house indicated, which was not far distant in one of the crowded streets near the water-side, an old woman, in whose person rags and filthl predominated, came to the door in answer to the hackman's heavy rap. "Plague on 'em," she exclaimed, " if there aint Jack Dick agin. Just what I said. I telled Bob he wa n't fit to go out alone, no more 'an nothin'; but the critter would go, and I reckon he's 'bout done to now, and I don't care if he is." "This man has been badly injured, ma'am," said the stranger accompanying him, " and this, I understand, is his lodging-house. Is there any one here to take care -of him'?" "I should n't wonder if there was n't. You jest take him over the way to Sal Barrows; she 's first rate   3832     HEIE AND HEREAFTER: at nursing, and Jack aint no 'count to Bob, now. But maybe sir, you 're a relation of hisn; should n't mind takin' care on him if I can be paid for it; we works for our livin', and can't afford to have the old man a dyin' on our hands." "He is no relation of mine, and I cannot insure you any payment for your nursing," was the answer of the young man, disgusted with the woman's selfish mean- ness. "Remain here," to the driver, " while I go over the way." In answer to his knock, a woman presented herself at the door, who, though bearing every mark of poverty, had at least a face which was a recommenda- tion. In a few words he made known his errand. "Yes, sir," she answered, "I can take care of him. Poor Dickson! he has had a hard life of it these years back. I 'll do my best for him." "You shall be well paid, Mrs. Barrows," was the answer. The woman looked up, colored, and said: "No, Miss - that is, Sarah Barrows, if you please." Poor and desolate enough was the little bedroom up stairs to which the unconscious man was borne;, but it was neat and orderly, and the hackman was de- spatched for a physician. The stranger said to the woman: "I have reason to believe that this man's mind is burdened with a se- cret it much concerns-me to know. Take faithful care of him, and if he should become delirious before my re- turn, which will be in a few hours, note carefully every word he says, but don't repeat them to any one but me. I can trust you?" Again the woman's face was suffused with a momen- tary glow, and she answered, gravely, "You can; I will do your bidding."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      333 'This arrangement made, the stranger, who was James Clarke, was driven to a hotel, where, having made himself comfortable after his long sea-voyage, he sat down and wrote to his sister, informing her of his arrival in New York and its incidents, and his hopes respecting John Dickson. As soon as he had finished and dined, he hastened back, through crowded streets and dirty thoroughfares, to the house in which he had left his protgge. He found him delirious, but the doc- tor said he would probably be rational after a quiet sleep. "What has he said?" inquired James, anxiously. "O, he's been raving mostly about being in Boston, and about an old man and his money; but he has n't called any names, and some things he said I could n't make out." As James bent over the old sufferer's pallet, he began to mutter to himself: "It was all of the money he cheated me out of, when we was both young-all of that, but I did n't kill him - kill him -kill him!" his voice rising higher and higher, until he shrieked out in tones of piercing anguish, "He did n't kill him neither -money done it - money - money!-he was Scared to death- he was 'fraid of me! - he want-- he was ;'fraid of losing his money. O money, money! what a curse you 've been to me! I threw it all into the sea, I did; and then I slept - ha, ha! That was a lucky thought for you, Jack Dickson; ha, ha! it was. Takes you, Jack, to git round 'em. I saw it go--down, down, down-all the gold and silver--and the bank-bills with them. I done it. He 's innocent - he did n't git the money. I'd a son myself, once - so I watched and watched -but he never come. Oh! 6h! I see his face now - take him away - take him away - I can't look   334      HERE AND HEREAFTER: at it. But I did n't keep the money, ha, ha! I did n't!" His language now became incoherent, and soon he fell into a quiet sleep. "It's working right," said the woman. "The doc- tor gave him something to still him." "He is the man I supposed," said James, "and his life is of great consequence to me. Should he be ra- tional when he awakes, and inquire for a person by the name of Clarke, tell him such a one has been here to see him, and will call again soon." Early the next morning Dickson awoke in his right mind, and seeing himself in a strange place, called out loudly, "Bob -Nell " "You're not with them folks, Mr. Dickson," said Sarah Barrows, coming forward. "A good gentleman picked you up after you got hurt and brought you here for me to take care of." "That 's one good piece of luck; but, O dear, I did n't find him, and I know he was 'board the Clypso. . Well, if I aint like to weather this, I 'll have a lawyer to wit- ness my affidavy; and you must take it to Boston, Sal. You promise you 'll do it?" "Yes, Mr. Dickson, anything you wish; but who did you want to find?" "That's nothin' to you, woman," was the answer, in a dogged tone. "No, only the young gentleman that brought you here was a passenger in that ship, and he was mighty earnest about you." "Passenger in the Clypso? What did he say his name was?" "Yes; and he said his name was Clarke, and he told me to tell you he'd do you no harm." "Young Clarke!" the wretched, enfeebled old man : .C   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      335 cried out, and with an almost superhuman exertion of strength, he sprang up in his bed. "He 's found, he's found at last, and I can do one good thing for all the bad ones that 's on my soul." "Fetch him here; do you hear, Sarah? -fetch him here quick." Sarah endeavored to pacify the almost frenzied crea- ture. She told him Mr. Clarke was at his hotel, but she expected him soon. "Fetch him! fetch him! send somebody for him. Send for a lawyer. I will swear to it. Tell the doctor to stay. Here, Sarah, bring my old- coat there; now you rip open the breast a bit. There 't is, my affidavy. I writ it long ago. I'm a thief, but I did n't kill the old miser."  He was fast working himself into a state of uncon- trollable excitement, when, most opportunely, James Clarke and the doctor both arrived. His agitation was excessive when they entered his room and came to his bedside. The doctor told him, in a tone of authority, that his reason depended upon his being quiet. He soon became comparatively calm, and requested to be left alone with James. "I don't expect you'll forgive me, Mr. Clarke," he immediately commenced, "but maybe you would if you know'd all, and how much I've suffered lately on account of it." "I do forgive you, already, so far as I know what to forgive. Only tell me everything, -how my father died, and what has become of his money; for I presume that is what you wish to see me about." It appeared from the account which he gave of him- self, that this Dickson had been defrauded by Mr. Clarke, the father, of a considerable sum of money. Both were *\           . ^/ ,' "  ";- .    $336      HERE AND HEREAFTER : unscrupulous in their transactions, and for the sake of gain neither would hesitate at any measures which he could safely employ. Dickson led a wandering life,- first, as a sort of general speculator and horse-trader; but of late years he had sunk down into a gambler of the worst description, if there are grades in that lnost detestable and debasing vice. What little of moral prin- ciple he may once have had, seemed now to be wholly deadened. Although in his earlier career he always had a plenty of money, latterly he had become very poor. After one of his long absences he returned to Boston penniless; and then, after endeavoring in vain to induce Clarke to pay what he owed him, he conceived the plan of the robbery, and carried it into execution. It was in one of these interviews with the old man that he threatened to murder him but he would have his money; not, however, meaning what he said, but, know- ing his debtor's cowardice, to work on his feelings. "Well, you see," he proceeded, " when I got into the old man's room that night, and pulled out the trunk from under his pillar, he was so skeared that he could n't stir nor speak; and sich a look as he looked at me with I never seed before ; and it has been right before me all the time since. Well, you see, I was so skeared myself, that I laid hold on the trunk and run as if the Devil had been at my heels, - as the old feller was, and I expect he 'll get me at last. I did n't go back to the old wo- man's, but hid in a place I had, and heered the next day how he was found dead in his bed, and robbed, and all. Then I had as much as I could do to get out of the coun- try; but an old comrade helped me for a consideration. Well, when we got out to sea, that look of the old man's haunted me so, I went enermost mad. In the dark it was oilers starin' at me. So one bright moonlight   OR, THE- TWO ALTARS;      337 night, I jest took the money and hove it overboard- the whole lot--I wropped the gold and silver in the bank-bills and jest dropt it down into the water when nobody seed me. I thought then that face would n't haunt me no more; but it kept starin' at me all the time jest the same. I never once thought I had ought to keep the money for them it belonged to ; all I could think on was that awful face. When I went to sleep it was starin' at me, and when I waked up it was starin' at me ; and it was oilers starin' at me in my dreams. You 'll skuse me, Mr. Clarke, but I never seed a much more onlikely one than hisn was- natrally; but, O Lord, it was awful, awful, as it looked then, and it will oilers be starin' at me I 'spect now! Well, when I come home agin, in little more than a year, I heerd you'd been 'spected and gone off out the country. Well, I felt desp'rate bad 'bout it, but I did n't feel bad enough to do the thing that was right by you, you see: One reason was, I was 'fraid they'd take me up and hang me for the murder of the old man. So I jest went back to Rio agin, to end my days there. Well, last winter- but it was summer in them parts-- I took one of the awful fevers they has there, and I lay at death's doors I don't know how many weeks, and all the time that face was starin' at me, and I thought I should run mad and die, and I wished I could, for no hell can be worse than his face starin' at me. Well, I made a vow then if ever I did git well, I 'd come home and do you justice. It was some time afore I got 'bout agin, and then I had the palsy all on one side, which was 'bout the same as dead. Well, I got a chance to come back, and I went right straight to the old woman in your town and gin her money to keep my secret, and find out about you. So she did, and then I come right on here, and I 're 29   338      HERE AND HEREAFTER; been watching for a month every vessel that come from Indy. I knowed I should find you, I was so sot on it. Now I want you to take this here affidavy, and have it made proper like, when that are lawyer comes. That 's the figure now." And, breathless and exhausted, the old man sank back upon his pillow. It was a dirty, crumpled half-sheet of paper that he gave to James Clarke, and ran as follows:- ' "Rio, Jan'y 1856. "This affidavy sertifies that old Rubin Clarke's sun never stole the old man's monny, nor no ways tuk his life, nor I did n't nuther. I did steele the box of mon- ney and throwd it all over board on my passage out to Rio on borde the ship pollyan. the old man dyde of fright and his sins. he cheeted me when we was young men or I should n't never stole his monny. "This I sware to "JOHN DICKSON." This instrument the wretched man acknowledged in the presence of the lawyer and physician, insisting that this should be kept, and refusing to have another drawn up in due form. As soon as it was witnessed, he handed it to James Clarke, saying: "Now go your way, and don't have too hard thoughts on me. I 've been a hard character, I acknowledge, and I never robbed anybody but old Reuben, and I 've done my best to make up for that. Sometimes I enermost hope God 'll pardon such an old sinner as I be; but I don't know, I spect rather I 've got to burn for it." "It is wrong for you to talk in that way, Mr. Dick- son; God will pardon all repentant sinners in Christ the Saviour of men, and he will pardon you if you are   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      339 truly penitent. Think of that until I see you again; and in the mean time compose yourself and get some rest." James took the doctor aside and asked his opinion of his patient. "He will recover from this attack, now that his mind is at rest; but his life is well-nigh worn out, and cannot last through another winter," was the answer. "Can he be removed safely to Massachusetts within a few days?  "In the course of a week, I should judge." "Thank you, sir; I will see you again to-morrow." And with a full heart the young,man returned to his hotel and sat down to write, this time to Mr. Norton. The letter was long and affecting, for it was the out- pouring of grateful feelings. After relating how he came in possession of the paper which proved his inno- cence, and saying that he should delay a few days in New York to take Dickson with him to Boston, he pro- ceeded with some account of his own religious expe- rience, and of the temptations he had encountered in that foreign land, to which his vices had expatriated him; and how Mr. Norton's last words and his friendly Christian letters had apparently been the agencies God had employed in bringing about the change which he felt had taken place in his character and life. He dwelt, with the eloquence of one who feels that whereof he speaks, upon the length of time that elapsed before he was able to overcome his own hasty, passionate impul- siveness, and bring himself under the guidance of reason and principle, - before in faith and love he could sur- render his own rebellious will to the control of a higher power than his own,-before he could become as a little child at the feet of his Saviour.   340       HERE AND HEREAFTER: "When this change came," he continued, "I realized what it was to become a new man in Christ Jesus. The little I could do to give light to others I have done, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that my efforts have not been wholly without success; for when my associates knew how I had been tempted and fallen, and saw how I was striving to live a different life, they said, 'We W cannot doubt there is a reality in religion.'  "I have some hope that in the same manner I may be permitted to act upon the heart of the benighted creature whom Providence has committed to my charge,  i and lighten his passage down to the -grave. At least, I can but try. Annie must wish me to postpone-my re- turn a few days on his account, I know. The first hour it is safe for him to travel I shall leave. I shall be obliged to tax the kindness of Mrs. Norton and Miss Ellis to engage a comfortable boarding-house for him. , "I write all this, my dear sir, because I consider that I owe it to you to tell you how great I feel my ob- ligations are to you, and because I can say on paper, and you can read, what I might not find it so easy to say or you to hear when we meet; and because, more- over, I desire that you should know that your merciful kindness to me has been the means of saving my soul, and perhaps many others also. To you it is owing that I have been able to do good to any one, and if I shall succeed in malting any impression upon this poor, feeble old man, it will be in consequence of what you have done for me." In less than a week the wanderer was at home under the hospitable roof of Mr. and Miss Ellis. There was- scarcely a shadow of resemblance between the James Clarke of three years back and the young man who now stood before them in the vigor of early maturity, with   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       g41 calm purposes and fixed' principles, relying for strength where alone it could be found. Ah, gentle, lovely Annie Clarke! well may thy young heart throb almost to bursting at such an excess of hap- piness. The betrothed of one whose life has been as pure and stainless as thine own, the sister of another now worthy of thy love, what is wanting to the fulness of thy joy? Yet this meeting between the brother and sister was not wholly without alloy, so irreversible is the decree that the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the chil- dren. True, James had returned to his native land with a full vindication of his character; but justice could not be rendered to Dickson without an acknowledgment of the cause of his robbing their father, and thus the disgrace attaching to that parent's memory in a meas- ure fell upon them. But they bore their cross in pa- tience and humility; Annie, because it was her nature to do so; and-James, because he -felt that, in conse- quence of lhis' own past sinfulness, he deserved the punishment. 29 g   O^,4Z   HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXXIII. "For nothing lovelier can be found In woman, than to study household good, And good works in her husband to promote." -MLTON. "FAR up the highlands of our peerless Hudson, nest- ling lovingly among the mountains, is the village of L   , where your friend is passing a week at the par-  sonage of the Rev. Edgar Manning. We, that is Mel- ville and myself, came a few days since from Y  where we left mother in her usual state of health, en- joying, as is her wont, the beautiful sights and sounds of that beautiful region. I came here with something of my old spirit of fault-finding, on the alert to find my husband's old friend, and schoolfellow, quite an object of commiseration; but I am forced to acknowledge that even your good neighbor, Mrs. Grey, could not discover much here to exercise her amiable gifts upon. In the busy, happy wife, graceful hostess, and fond mother, it would be difficult to recognize the former sentimental Julia Delavan, who now seems to have found a sphere she is admirably fitted to fill. "I do not say that Mrs. Manning has become a very intellectual woman, but as we long since agreed that something beside large abilities and great attainments were essential to insure domestic happiness, you will not be surprised if I do not make much account of these in my estimate of the character of our country parson's wife. Now that she has had some experience in the i ,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       343 actual realities of life, and has learned some lessons, of which before she was ignorant, she is by no means de- ficient in good sense and intelligence, and as her hus- band seems to be perfectly satisfied with her as she is, I do not know why anybody else should complain. / "Mr. Manning is one of those men (you know there are such) who do not care to converse much upon the deep and serious themes which engross so large a share of their own thoughts, excepting with their peers; and consequently, when he is with his wife and little ones, he is quite ready to come down to their level and interest himself in their interests, the good, consid- erate man. I do not think it has ever occurred to him to regret that he had a world of thoughts and aspira- tions which his pretty, graceful wife does not share with him. "We very exacting wives, Delia, who claim some right to discuss with our lords all subjects of pliloso- phy, or theology, or literature, with which their minds are occupied, that we may perchance catch some glimp- ses of the lofty heights of thought whereon they sit enthroned, might not be quite content with the position in this particular which Julia appears to be so happy to fill, so we will let that pass. "There are no signs of poverty or thriftlessness in this sweet little parsonage, furnished so tastefully by the good wife's uncle; and although Mr. Manning's salary is not astonishingly large, they live so simply and receive so many luxuries for their table from the gardens and farms of their well-to-do parishioners, who never fail to remember their rector in the abundance of the things they possess, they find it, as yet, quite suf- ficient for their wants. "Mrs. Manning related to me, with some spirit, your   344      HERE AND HEREAFTER: Cousin Clara's picture of her future fortune as the wife of a clergyman, which she said, with some exultation, has not yet been realized, whatever may be in the years that are to come. Her two children are bright, active, and pretty; and, what is a great household comfort in these days, well behaved too, so that I am actually able to lay down a parasol, or a piece of work, without the fear of their destruction before my eyes. ' I cannot, woman-like, help saying to Melville occa- sionally as an aside,' I told you so,' reminding him of the days when he so mourned over his friend's infatua- tion with the romantic Julia, and when I, more in the spirit of. contradiction than anything else I confess, would reply, ' I did n't doubt she would make a pattern wife.' "Julia was always amiable, you know, and she now never appears so interesting to me as when she is ren- dering some kindness or addressing some pleasant words to her poorer neighbors, and I cannot help thinking how much more lovely she is than she ever was in her moth- er's pretentious city home, where there was such a con- stant and wearisome struggle to keep up a certain style, which was far above what her income would allow. 'You see, Mrs. Temple,' she said to me one morning when I went into the kitchen and found her with her w lite arms bare to the elbows kneading dough, 'I am in my element here, where I have some real work to do; it does n't much matter what it is. Mary is sick this morning, and I am cook, while Edgar is nursery-man.' ' No,' I answered, ' it does n't much matter if one only carries the spirit of cheerfulness into all one's employ- ments. You have n't seen much of the shady side of ministerial life yet, I fancy?' 'No, very little, for I have good health, and we have never had any serious   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       345 sickness among us since we came here to live. In such an event, perhaps we might, as we have little or noth- ing beyond the means to meet present wants. But the sunny side of life has its trials, you knows in the minis- try or out of it.' "But the marvel of marvels here is Miss Elenore Clavers. You know she carried her point with' her Aunt Hightop, and got her interest in favor of a visit to her Uncle Edgar, and then Mr. Fitzroy gave an unwill- ing consent. So my little lady of flounces, French flowers, and finery is actually established here in a small chamber, which, however, she occupies only at night. It is a wonder to me, that, with all the efforts made to enforce the iron rules of fashion, even before the little ones leave their cradles, how some natures rebel against them, and in their restlessness and insta- bility at last find their proper sphere. "You would suppose that Elenore Clavers was born a farmer's daughter, could you see her here, feeding the poultry, watering the plants, exploring the woods, gath- ering berries, and doing any and everything she can put her hands to, with an interest and eagerness, too, never exhibited, according to your account, in learning a les- son or practising her music. Her heart, also, is ex- panding. You know  you said last year she never showed any regard for any one excepting Felice, and that, you thought, was because they were so opposite to each other in their dispositions. Here she has already become-very fond of her Aunt Julia and her little cous- ins, and I believe she and her aunt sympathize a good deal with each other in their tastes and pursuits. Ele- nore declares she will live with her Uncle Edgar always; and when I suggested to her that there were others to be consulted with regard to the matter, she said the   346      HERE AND HEREAFTER: only compromise she would listen to would be to spend her summers here and stay at Mr. Fitzroy's winters. When I still expressed my doubt with reference to such an arrangement, with a significant nod of the head, she said, 'I always have had my way, and I always will. I 'll torment Aunt Hightop into consenting. I can carry anything I want to in that way.' "I believe the girl will be as good as her word, and I think it would be far the better course to let her expend her energies here in the free and innocent pursuits of country life than in gaining her ends in tormenting her relatives. Her maid accompanied her to L---, but as there was no room for her in the parsonage, she fortu- nately found a desirable situation for the summer at one of the neighboring country 'seats. You would have been amused could you have seen Elenore after an expedi- tion to the mountains, the first day I came. In all her wardrobe she had n't a single dress suitable for such an excursion, and she was in a most deplorable plight. Slhe said she was glad of it, and went the next day to a shop in the village and purchased some stout, coarse gingham, which was soon converted into garments for such occasions. ' Elenore has the material for a strong,' energetic character, and with her wealth may become a very use- ful woman if only the right influences can be made to predominate in her education. Just now she is at- a critical period. It may be a few years hence she will be as much absorbed in the gayeties of life as she is now in her rural occuptions; but I think it will be otherwise. How many souls there are, Delia, in this strange world of ours, trembling in the balance between good and evil, only needing some slight word perchance of wise coun- sel to decide the scale!   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       347 "Elenore told me, a few days since, with a good deal of seriousness in her impetuous manner, that, although she always hated her way of life at Mrs. Fitzroy's and her aunt's, she never knew there was anything so un- like it until she visited at your house. Ah, dear friend, your wayward Adie is not the first nor the last person whom you have influenced for good without any such purpose. "This unconscionable epistle must end at once." Enclosed with Mrs. Temple's letter to Mrs. Norton was the following from Felice : - "4 DEAR MAMMA DELIA: - "Grandmamma brought me here for a few days, as she was to visit a friend of hers who lives in this neigh- borhood. I am glad to see Mrs. Temple and Elenore. I feel almost happy again, though I do not love to run about as much as Elenore. But - but - for all - yes, I must tell you, though I thought I would n't! I want to come home, home-to you, when Uncle Herbert goes away again to school. O, please to send for me. Grand-. mamma said yesterday to her friend, Mrs. Harcourt, she thought she might keep me with her in New York all winter. I could n't breathe; I should n't live. My heart pains me now sometimes, it aches so for you and little Helen; and I don't see any gentlemen with such a kind smile as dear Uncle Leslie's. May I come home? Do say I may, dear Mamma Delia. "Your own, own little "FELICE."   348      HERE AND- HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXXIV. 'No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure 'scape." - SHAKESPEARE. THE return of James Clarke of course was a good deal remarked upon and discussed in the quiet town of N   , and for a time, that event, the vindication of his innocence, and his kindness to Dickson formed the prin- cipal topics of conversation with a portion of its inhabit- ants. It so happened that the directresses of the Ladies' Sewing Society, having some business to attend to and work to prepare, held a meeting at their rooms in Beech Hall, while these were the chief matters of interest in that neighborhood. Mrs. Grey was present, and she improved the earliest opportunity to say to Miss Ellis, in a tone which she vainly endeavored to render con- gratulatory, "How glad you must be to have James Clarke back again, now that he has so fortunately been cleared of suspicion with regard to the death and robbery of his father. I suppose he must have had some information about this man Dickson before he left India?"   i "I suppose he knew nothing about him," replied Miss Ellis, sharply. "His meeting with the man in New York was purely incidental, or I should say, rather, providential; since it seems, from your remark, that there are those who had considered him guilty of a heinous crime."   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       349 "Circumstances were surely against him, Miss Ellis; with all your partiality for himself and sister, you can- not deny that." "Not to my mind, ma'am." "La, Miss Grey," interposed Mrs. Brown, " anybody that had known James Clarke, as I have ever since he was a little chap in the cradle, never b'lieved he was guilty of robbin' that old man; he wa' n't made of that sort of stuff at all, I can tell ye." "He was made of that sort of stuff, it seems, that he would do things pretty bad, Mrs. Brown," was the re- tort. "When young men get desperate, there's never any telling what they will be left to do." "'Cause a young feller gits a little out of the right road he 'll steal and murder, hey? That's your notion, is it, Miss Grey? P'raps you would n't like such things said about your son." Mrs. Grey reddened. Report did not speak very highly of Master Lewis Grey's morals. What reply the mother would have made is uncertain, had not Mrs. Musgrave now joined in the converstion by say- ing: "When it is considered how James Clarke was situated at home, and what influences he was sur- rounded by there, it is not to be wondered at that he should have gone astray when he-was first exposed to temptation. I often tell Mr. Musgrave that we are reaping the reward of our care and watchfulness in seeing Frederick such a steady, promising young man. But the case of Mr. Clarke was different: he had no nother, and his father with 'his peculiar habits was not very fit person to be intrusted with the education of lhildren." "I've seen sons of the most likeliest parents that lid n't always go very straight," interposed Mrs. Brown, 30 /   350       HERE AND HEREAFTER: in whom the spirit of opposition was as much excited by Mrs. Musgrave as it was in Miss Ellis by Mrs. Grey. "Exceptions, however, to the general rule, you must allow, Mrs. Brown," answered Mrs. Musgrave; "if my sons should be guilty of any improprieties or vices, I should feel it was my fault more than theirs." "Well," broke in Mrs. Brown, 4 that would be all odd feeling for you to have." The meaning of this remark, to those who understood Mrs. Brown, was very evident; but Mrs. Musgrave chose to take it as complimentary, and she answered: "I as- sure you, Mrs. Brown, no one can be more clear-sighted to one's own deficiencies than I am to mine," To this, Mrs. Brown made no reply. Turning to Miss Ellis, she inquired about John Green, who had a few days previously come from  the house of correction. Miss Ellis answered that he wos boarding with Mrs. Black, and that Ann was exerting herself with remarka- ble energy to keep him from falling back again into his former habits; but they all had fears with regard to the result. "Another of Mrs. Norton's strange notions," again commenced Mrs. Grey, " keeping that girl out of the factory and encouraging her in her idleness as she does." "Pray, who is your informant with regard to the girl's idleness?" asked Miss Ellis. ' I know something about her, and I consider her remarkably diligent for one of her'early training." O, facts speak for themselves, Miss Ellis; but our opinions do not coincide with regard to these matters; and I must say I think Mrs. Norton rather an inconsist- ent woman; she professes to be a Christian, and yet she fills the heads of these poor children with ideas unsuited   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       351 to their condition, gives them indulgences such as they never have been accustomed to; and indeed, almost every day I hear of her doing some unwise, inconsistent thing or other." "Such as?" asked Miss Ellis, with enforced caln- ness. 4"Why, she took a poor dress-'maker, who happened to have some talent for music, from her useful trade and her proper position, and had her take lessons of a very accomplished master of the art; and has actually'-' installed her teacher of her adopted daughter. Then there is that Green boy, she expects to make a great scholar of him, and has filled his head with the notion that he may be a governor or a Ininister or what not. Then she actually had one of hr own kitchen servants taught dress-making, and employs her in her own family. And I hear also she intends to send her gardener's son to college; and, to crown the whole, I understand she now has on foot a plan for Mrs. Hart to receive into her family Irish girls to educate for service in the families of the wealthy. And I don't know how many such absurd things I have heard about her. Of course, Miss Ellis, if I have been misinformed, you can set me right; I only state what I have heard." Mrs. Grey paused and looked up defiantly at Miss Ellis, as if to challenge a denial of what she had said. At first, Miss Ellis appeared as if she disdained, to make any reply. Presently, however, she said, "You are pretty correct, I believe, Mrs. Grey, in your statements as far as they go. I could easily supply other instances of the same kind of absurdity of which Mrs. Norton has been guilty, which may not have come to your knowl- edge. Now Mrs. Norton holds the heretical doctrine, it seems, that the development of talent is always to be   352      HERE AND HEREAFTER: desired, and that it is a duty to aid others to rise as high in the world as they are capable of doing. That is her practical commentary on the parable of the ten talents. -The dress-maker, of lwhom you speak, has an unusual faculty for music, and had found that her former em- ployment was ruining her health, beside being inade- quate to the support of herself and aged, parents. She now earns a comfortable livelihood, and has time to de- vote to them. Sammy Green, from an idle, mischievous boy, has become a bright and diligent scholar, and Mrs. Norton thinks it well to encourage him, though I don't know how it is with regard to his expectations of becoming president of the United States or governor of our own Commonwealth. More unlikely things have happened.. The servant, who is now a dress-maker, had a decided vocation for that trade, and Mrs, Norton judged that another might be found who could sweep and dust as well as she. The gardener's son she will educate at college, he being a young man of great prom- ise, and having been advised to that course by Mr. Howe. As to Mrs. Hart's school for domestics, Mrs. Norton hopes to make it the germ of an institution which shall prove a blessing to. all classes of society, and do something towards remedying one of the chief evils in housekeeping." "O yes, I understand, Miss Ellis; but my opinion re- mains the same still. I acknowledge I am old-fashioned, and believe that God, in placing his children in this world in different positions, knows better than we for what they are fitted." '"I don't so understand the appointments of our Heav- enly Father, Mrs. Grey. I believe it is our -duty to make the most of the gifts God has bestowed upon us, and to assist others to do the same. I presume if your   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       353 son Lewis had the talents of a Webster, you would not object to his becoming a distinguished statesman, al- though his Heavenly Father has not bestowed upon him such eminence? 9" "By no means, Miss Ellis. I consider that there is no position too high for the Greys to aspire to, having descended in a direct line from the Greys of Grey Park. I was only speaking of the lower classes." 4 Humph," was all the reply Miss Ellis vouchsafed. She had not patience to argue the question longer with a woman whose views seemed to her so contrary to the spirit of the Christian religion. Miss Ellis believed in the innate nobility of the human soul; a nobility con- ferred by God himself, which made man the brother of Jesus Christ, and an heir with him of heavenly glory. Mrs. Grey might trace her genealogy back to the Greys who received a domain and were knighted under Henry IV., but Mrs. Norton's gardener's son was a child of God, an inheritor of his kingdom, and was developing abilities of the greatest promise. Why did not Miss -Ellis say this? Did Mrs. Grey, and others like her, who arrogate to themselves peculiar excellences, and claim an exemption from the common weaknesses of hu- manity, ever pause in their self-assumption to reflect from whom the humblest of mortals, as well as the proudest, derive their descent? Did she or they ever seriously consider the purport of the parable of Dives and Lazarus? But Mrs. Grey was not yet done with Mrs. Norton, who seems to have been the object of her particular an- tipathy. sAt all events, Miss Ellis," she proceeded, "you must allow, that, for a Christian professor, Mrs. Nor- ton interests herself very much in worldly matters. She is not in the least a retiring or meditative Christian." 30    354      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "You speak with a good deal of assurance, Mrs. Grey. As I am not so well informed with regard to Mrs. Norton's private religious habits and practices as you appear to be, I can neither affirm nor deny what you say. I can only judge of her in these respects from re- sults, and thus judging, I should say she was in the best sense of the word a very meditative Christian. Slle does not deem it her duty to become a religious devotee in order to be a Christian, especially when she finds so much to occupy her interests and activity in the sphere of life in which Providence has placed her. She thinks she is best serving her Maker when she best serves her fellow-creatures, and the more she has a special refer- ence to hereafter in her motives, the more does she find here for her hands to do and her thoughts to be engaged upon." "But after all, Miss Ellis, you must admit that for such very good people there was a good deal of frolick- ing at Rosedale when the family were not in mourning." "I don't know what you call frolicking, Mrs. Grey. Mrs. Norton approves of healthy, rational amusements, and encourages them in her own home, having realized the good of such herself, and wisely concluding that others in this particular are like herself." Wearied of the discussion, Miss Ellis turned to Mrs. Musgrave, saying, "If you please I will take those gar- ments with me to fit another day." The conversation was here interrupted by the en- trance of Ann Green to inform Miss Ellis that visitors from Boston were awaiting her at home. Something of a change had taken place in this girl since the first acquaintance of my readers with her, sit- ting ragged and dirty on the door-steps. She was now neat and erect, and her bright black eyes beamed with v   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      3 55 something beside mischief and impudence. She came into the room in a quiet, orderly manner, and did her errand civilly, although it was still evident that she was Ann Green. She was employed now a greater part of the time at Elm Hill, assisting in the lighter work of the house. Her highest ambition was to prepare herself to live with Miss Annie when she should have an establish- ment of her own. Although she was fond of reading, she was not much inclined to study. She was accus- tomed to say she would do anytling in the world for Miss Annie but study Algebry. One day, a few weeks after the engagement of the young lovers, Ann was sitting with Miss Ellis, busied in sewing, when the latter observed that every few minutes her face would relax into a broad grin, and then she would utter a low chuckle. At last, she said to her, "What amuses you so much, Ann?" "La, Miss Ellis, I knowed it long ago." "Knew what, Ann?" "Why about Miss Annie and Mr. Duncan. I guess I knowed -knew, I mean-before they did themselves." "How, pray?" "O I watched 'em so close; 'cause you see I thought they ought to be in love if they was n't. They are two of the prettiest people I ever did see; and so I found it out, the way he and she looked; and I made up my mind then I 'd git a situation that would suit me. I would n't live with anybody, Miss Ellis, I don't like to be ordered about; there 's somethin' in my nature that says, Ann Green, don't you budge an inch if you are ordered. They never orders; Miss Annie she always speaks so gentle and ladylike, if she wants anything; and Mr. Duncan, he says, If you please, Ann, will you find my gloves. Well, that makes me feel as if I was   356   '   HERE AND HEREAFTER' worth some respect too, and I never coutld .b -    i them, you know. But when anybody is cross ' treats me like a nigger, then I think of so , things to say, and out they come slap-dash; and.:O ". what a bad girl Ann Green is! Miss Ellis," sho Hil : ':^ with a sudden change in her manner, "I wonder,+- made Mr. Duncan so long making up his mind to sjieak. If I 'd been in his place, I'd jest got down on my knees, hard ground and all, out in them there woods, and told Miss Annie there how I worshipped her like the moon in the sky; tht 's what I'd done. Instead, he waited and waited, and both was as unhappy as they could be, and then, when he was most dead, they cleared all up. I don't see the sense of acting so." "You must go to them for an explanation, Ann, if - you desire one," replied Miss Ellis, smiling. "Mean- time you have got your hem all awry." "La sakes, so I have. Well, I s'pose I must pick it out. Miss Ellis,. you don't s'pose Miss Annie wants me to go to school, do you?" "Why do you ask?" "'Cause she said something about it once. Now I don't want to go 'mongst them stuck-up girls, and hare 'em twitting me about my father, 'cause I don't know so much ciphering and algebry as they do. I 'll study as much as I can to please Miss Annie, and git my lessons real well if I must, if I can only stay with her when I aint wanted at Miss - Mrs. Black's. When I git with them, those girls, it calls up all the old ugliness in me, and I reckon if I stay with Miss Annie, I 'll learn to be good some time. She told me a real pretty story one day about goodness, something like this, that good peo- ple are like the moon gitting light from the sun', and 'fleeting it on other people, and making them light too,   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      . 357 g"  moon does the earth.

"You will meet with a great :miy:dark bodies in your journey through life." i: Sha'n't mind that, I reckon, after I've got a lot of Miss Annie's light; shall have some to spare then for them perhaps." "It may be that you are right, Ann," answered Miss Ellis; " at all events, it is only anothfi  form of the prayer, 'Lead us not into temptation.'"   358      HERE AND HEREAFTER: CHAPTER XXXV. "And one desert Barren and cold, on which the'wild waves break, But nothing rests save carcases and wrecks, Rocks and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness."- BYRON. IN those months which had been so full of events to the families at Rosedale and Elm Hill, Mrs. Norton had seen but little of her cousin, Mrs. Fitzroy. During all the weeks, when she had been so anxious with re- gard to the fate of her husband, the latter had made her but one visit, and that was short and unsatisfac- tory. Mrs. Fitzroy doubtless felt a good deal of sympa- thy for Mrs. Norton, but she did not appear to know how to express it. Beside, she was miserable herself, and looked pale and worn, although she seemed averse to speaking of her own health, or of that of her child. Upon the return of the family to Oak Park in the spring, the intercourse of the cousins was not much more frequent than it had been in the winter; the time of each lady being occupied according to her respective habits and pursuits. After the departure of Elenore Clavers to visit her Uncle Manning, Mr. Fitzroy filled the suite of apartments which she had vacated with guests of his own choice, and during the whole summer there had been one continued round of gayety, and such amusements as the country affords. It was scarcely a matter of surprise, therefore, to Mrs. Norton, to receive a hasty summons to her cousin one day in autumn.  She went expecting to find her sick,   OB, THE TWO ALTARS.       359 but upon being ushered into her apartments she was met with a scene which even with her firm nerves and well-balanced mind she could not witness without ex- treme agitation. Reader, have you ever been summoned to a house- hold, the law of whose life is selfish enjoyment, when some sudden and terrible calamity has fallen upon it; and where in consequence all is confusion and horror; where those who should comfort and support, are re- viling and recriminating each other; where no prayer of faith, or love, or submission, or even of agonized en- treaty, ascends to the Heavenly Father; where no rock of refuge is sought; where the brilliant illusions and gay ephemera of a mere earthly existence had fled away and left those who had followed and trusted to them in darkness and despair? If you have, perhaps you are able to form some conception of the state of things at Oak Park, upon the arrival of Delia Norton on that fair September morning, when the earth lay beaming in the glad smile of its Creator all around, while within that mansion of luxury all was desolation and woe. The blow had fallen at last, fallen too where one of the guilty parties had least expected it. Little Clarence had died in a fit that morning, after suffering apparent- ly great agony. Mrs. Fitzroy had retired to her bed, the night pre- vious, not to rest, but to toss her wearied frame in the vain hope of it, and endeavor to cool her fevered brow and still her excited spirits; for her health was fast giving way under the pressure of the care and fatigue ot:athe summer; and nature was now loudly demand- ing recompense for her exhausted forces. O ye who dwell in the abodes of honest poverty, and lie down at night to sweet sleep after days of toil, envy not your   bu0      HERE AND HEREAFTER: rich worldly neighbor who, as you imagine, lives a life of luxurious ease. Ease! Your hardest toil bears no comparison to the self-inflicted -drudgery which he un- dergoes day after day, and night after night, in his senseless pursuit after happiness which he finds not, where he is ever seeking for it. How like a chained galley-slave he labors at his task! How he eats, and drinks, and converses, and smiles, and goes hither and thither, does this, and leaves that undone, gives up all personal independence, foregoes the dear delights of sweet domestic peace at the omnipotent fiat of the god whom he serves, and for whom he lives! Thank your Heavenly Father in your hearts that he has preserved you from the temptations and sins of such a lot, and eat your crust of bread and drillk your cup of cold water in gratitude, and not in repining. To return from this digression; Mrs. Fitzroy towards - morning sank into an uneasy, dreamy slumber, from which  she was suddenly aroused by a succession of shrieks from  Mrs. March, who rushed into her room crying out, "The baby, the baby!" '"What is the matter?" gasped Mrs. Fitzroy. "What of Clarence!" "Dying in a fit! O dear, what shall I do?" It was too true; and the half-frantic mother could only stand and look upon the convulsed features of her child and wring her hands in helpless agony. Dr. Grant was immediately called, but before he ar- ' rived the little sufferer was dead. After looking at the lifelessbody a few minutes, and examining an empty cup on the table beside the bed of the nurse, he said to the mother, sternly: 1"Madam, I have good reason for believing your child's death was caused by an over-dose of some villanous mixture.  I warned you in ample season to beware of that woman and her vile practices." J   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       361 "4Pity me, Dr. Grant! 0 pity me!" was all the wretched mother could say. " I do pity you, Mrs. Fitzroy, from the depths of my heart. But pity will not restore to you the life of your child. Where is that woman ? " Mrs. March was not to be found. It was afterwards ascertained that she had fled, in the confusion conse- quent upon the death of little Clarence, in dread of the wrath of his father, who did little but curse and swear at her after he was called to his boy. Upon making this discovery', Mr. Fitzroy, whom Dr. Grant's presence could not restrain from enforcing his declarations with oaths, said, in the most violent manner, that he would have her arrested at once on the charge of murder. " Do so, Mr. Fitzroy," said Dr. Grant, in his sternest tone, " if you are willing to risk the disclosures she may make; otherwise let the wretched creature alone. I will undertake that she is rendered powerless for evil in the future." Nothing more was said upon the subject; for all Dr. Grant's skill and attention were required for Mrs. Fitz- roy, who 'had been seized with one of her hysterical affections; now sobbing in a low, piteous moan; now wringing her hands and crying out, " What shall I do ? O0, what shall I do ? " and now laughing wildly. The doctor ordered her to be taken to her own room, and suggested that her cousin should be sent for. And this was the house to which Delia Norton had been summoned from her own home, over which the angel of peace and love ever brooded; where, when her own child was taken from her, she bowed in submissive faith; and where the agony of the last winter's bitter trial had been known only to her God and the silent pages which received its record. When she entered, 31    362       HERE AND HEREAFTER: confusion and dismay seemed to prevail everywhere, and in her cousin's apartment there was none of the solemn quiet and order of heavy grief. On the couch was Mrs. Fitzroy, her form bowed in that crushed, shrinking attitude, which is always an evidence of con- fortless, despairing sorrow. Mr. Fitzroy was pacing the room in rapid strides, now glaring sternly at his wife's figure, now compressing his lips as if to restrain the ex- pression of the feelings raging in his heart. The bed was unmade, articles of the toilet were scattered about, one blind was wide open admitting the sun, seemingly to heighten the distressing effect of the whole scene. It was the work of a few moments only for Mrs. Nor- ton to persuade her cousin to lie down on the couch, close the blind, draw the curtains, gather up misplaced articles, and summon a servant to make the bed, upon which she then assisted in placing the sufferer. As now she thought she might be spared from the sick a few minutes, she requested the nurse's assistant to show her to the room where lay the body of Clarence. He was upon his little bed, his limbs composed, his features calm, and a sweet smile faintly visible upon his thin, wan face. "Blessed lamb," she said, " to have been thus early called to the Saviour's fold, with the Good Shepherd to walk in the green pastures and beside the still waters." In his sad, suffering life, Clarence had never looked so lovely as now, in the untroubled sleep of death. As Mrs. Norton gazed upon his inanimate form, she thought of those beautiful lines, so appropriate to one whose little pilgrimage here had been surely through a vale of tears - "Image of rest! how beautiful art thou, In the fixed quiet of thy marble brow!   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       863 All passionless and calm, like wintry skies In their cold vesture of ethereal dyes, When stars look downward from their quiet spheres, Serenely silent, on a world of tears." Although no feeling but that of thankfulness arose in her heart as she smoothed those silken locks, yet her tears fell fast and free. The patient child had been one of those winning little creatures who at once attract to- wards them every true mother heart, and although she had seen him only two or three times, she yet loved him, and could not but weep for him. Then, too, she wept to think that in the brief period of his earthly existence he had known so little of a child's rightful heritage, love and -health; and she remembered, also, when her own little Georgie lay as did Clarence now, a cold, pale corpse, on his bed, never more in this world to give word, look, or caress to his mother. A few mo- ments longer she lingered to dry her eyes and to gaze again upon that lifeless form, when she returned to her cousin, whom she found still awake and tossing rest- lessly upon her bed. "Do try to be calm, Clara," she said. "I have just been to see little Clarence, .and he looks so sweetly, and he is at rest now, and he will never know suffering more. You must be quiet, or you will make yourself seriously sick. How hot your hands and headare!" 'Yes, the doctor says I have a fever already, and must not be so restless. Perhaps I shall die. I wish I might, and yet I dare not. O Delia, I did love my child, weak and wicked as I have been, and it's no use trying to blame Mr. Fitzroy or the nurse altogether. I was guilty, I neglected him; and for what? Whatever it was, it gives me no comfort now." "No, Clara- there is but one source of comfort for you now. Will you not seek it there? Our Father in   364      HERE AND HEREAFTER: heaven will listen to you. Your child is with him, and he will grant you whatsoever you need, if you will ask him." How can I, -I who have sinned so deeply?" Christ came down from heaven, not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. Repentance is the only atonement you can make for the past; but  the future, it depends in a large measure upon you what it shall be under that grace which will be your help in every trial and struggle." "I will try, Delia, I will try. Perhaps if I always had you with me I might do differently for the future from what I have done." "I will be with you, Clara, as much as it is possible for me to." "But, Delia, my husband?" Your first duty is to your God, and if you walk in the strait and narrow way yourself, you may be able to influence your husband to do the same. Dear Clara, you have never yet found happiness where you have sought it. Look for it now where alone it can be found. But I must not talk with you longer to-day. Compose yourself to rest if you can." And taking up a Bible, whose elegant binding and fresh, fair leaves showed its purpose had not been use, she read a few selections of comforting passages, which had a soothing effect upon the sufferer, and then lightly withdrew, and went to her own home. In the afternoon she came again to Oak Park, and found Mrs. Fitzroy in a high fever, which developed into a typhoid. In two days more, amid the terrible ravings of the conscience-stricken mother, her child was carried to its peaceful resting-place in the neighboring cemetery. Day after day, and week after week, Delia Norton watched by the side of her cousin; for delirious "tI'   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      365 though she was, she seemed to know at once who was with her, and could be calmed in her wildest ravings by the voice whose loving sincerity she never had had any reason to doubt in health. It was, indeed, a sad sight to behold that young wo- man so reduced in body as to be as helpless as an infant, and yet, when the paroxysms of delirium were upon her, raising herself up in bed, and throwing up her hands, and crying out for her child, -for Mrs. March to bring back her child; begging her husband not to kill her, and she would do everything he wished; imploring Delia to take away those horrid creatures that were mocking her over the foothoard; then crying out that she could not dress for dinner, her head ached so. She must have her drops, her quieting drops; why did not Delia give them to her, they were so good and comforting she could not live without them. Mr. Fitzroy drank his bottle and two bottles of wine, and yet he would n't let ler have her drops, her quieting drops, that made her so happy. Then she would, in a low tone, declare that her dress-maker would never finish her brocade in sea- son for the ball; that her feathers were spoiled, and her laces were burned in the last fire; that Elenore had hidden her mantilla, and lost her fan, and that she should go to live with Mrs. Hart, and never trouble her any more; and she would rave in a like medley, until checked by sheer exhaustion. Mr. Fitzroy's state of mind all this time can better be conceived than described; his child, whom he had loved as much as he was capable of loving any being but himself, dead! his wife, whose every word of de- lirious agony was a reproof to himself, perhaps dying! He blamed Mrs. March as the wicked cause of all his trouble, although he could not but acknowledge in his     366       HERE AND HEREAFTER: heart that he was more in fault than any one else. He knew he had urged his wife to make exertions beyond her ability, and had thus caused her to yield to the temptation of gaining temporary strength by that perni- cious practice which is even more fatal than the wine- - cup, since a perverted conscience easily deludes itself into the belief that one is a necessity and the other only an indulgence. To gain her own base ends, Mrs. March had advised Mrs. Fitzroy to persist in her ruinous habit, and had furnished her with palliatives to some of its most dreaded consequences. This Mr. Fitzroy had suspected. In a terrible scene that had taken place over the dying child, his wife accused the nurse of being little Clarence's murderer, and wishing to be her own also!   Subse- quently, when Mr. Fitzroy angrily questioned her with regard to her statements, she acknowledged to him her habits, Mrs. March's fatal influence, and her fears lest their child's death had been caused in the manner inti- mated by Dr. Grant. Conscious as Mr. Fitzroy was that he could not make Mrs. March's conduct public without implicating his wife, he had not even that gratification to -an ungener- ous mind, the satisfaction of revenge. So he was left to the unenviable company of his own thoughts, for none of the large circle of his friends could console him. Meantime, contrary to the expectation of her physi- cian and friends, Clara Fitzroy passed through the crisis of her disease, and began slowly to recover. It was almost like a resurrection from the grave, so enfeebled and emaciated and utterly helpless was she. It was many weeks before she was able to leave her room, during all which time her cousin continued to visit and attend her with a sister's care and interest.   ORB, THE TWO ALTARS.       367 CHAPTER XXXVI. "And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part." - SHAKESPEARE. THE chapter out of the book of life .of the principal personages of this story is now drawing to a close, and these pages will have been written to little purpose if the reader has failed to trace in them the differing re- suits of worldly and of Christian aims and purposes. It only remains to bid a final adieu to those who have respectively taken part in the events that have been narrated. Several months have now elapsed since James Clarke's return to his native village, and he is on the eve of em- barking again for Calcutta; he goes not, however, in haste and disgrace, as formerly, ashamed to take leave of his best friends; but he goes with the respect and confidence of all who know him, and in that self-reliance which is based on good principles and Christian faith. He has become connected in business at the latter place with Mr. Lawton, who, with his young wife, our old acquaintance Helen Temple, is about to return to his native city to pass a few years. Towards his steadfast friend, Mr. Norton, he feels that deep gratitude and affectionate respect which a generous nature ever enter- tains for one from whom signal favors have been re- ceived. His Christian efforts in behalf of Dickson were not in vain, and he had the satisfaction of seeing him   368       HERE AND HEREAFTER: die repentant and believing, trusting in the mercy of his Heavenly Father vouchsafed through Jesus Christ. Mr. and Miss Ellis, in their new interests, and in their endeavors to promote the well-being of their neighbors and townspeople, are enjoying a serenity and hopeful- ness which compensate for much past suffering. Miss Ellis often says that the asperities of her-character and her disposition to pronounce harsh judgments have been not a little softened and subdued by her somewhat intimate acquaintance with Mrs. Norton, whose gentle manners and broad Christian charity have been at the same time her admiration and her example; while, on the other hand, Mrs. Norton ascribes an equal influence upon herself to that decided and unswerving devotion to duty and to right which so distinguish Miss Ellis. As for Duncan and Annie, they are still lingering in the enchanted land, under cerulean skies, gathering thornless roses, and enjoying to the full that brief period erelong to be succeeded by one of untried cares and duties; yet ever in their untroubled happiness re- membering to gather up strength for the experiences which shall come to them as to others. And what mat- ter, since their hopes are fast anchored where the con- flicts and sorrows of a mortal lot cannot disturb them? Ah, love in its highest, purest form can only exist where the homage due to the Creator is not forgotten in the affection given to the creature. Such is theirs, that of the gentle, beautiful, early disciplined Annie, and the refined, intellectual, and pious Duncan. If any of my younger readers are disposed to complain that the thread of their loves has been too slight in these pages, they must remember that the married, and not the un- married characters, have been the real heroes and hero- ines whose fortunes have been described.   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.        369 As for Howard Leslie, he is now   travelling on a business tour through the Western States of his native country, and in his constant correspondence with his brother never fails to send kind remembrances to his beautiful sister elect, and it is presumed and hoped that his brave heart is recovering from any wounds it may have received. Mr. Carter is a changed man since the death of his gentle wife. He is now ready to co-operate heart and hand with his partner in all his schemes for the benefit of the clerks and others in their employment. He is also devoted to his motherless children with a tenderness pleasant to witness. Not in vain lived and died that truly Christian woman, whose memory is cherished with affectionate 'reverence by her many friends; and the beauty of her daily life in the home from which she was so mysteriously taken, now that it has been fully revealed to her stern husband, is moulding his character into the image of his Saviour. Mrs. Musgrave was softened and improved in some particulars by her great affliction in the death of her daughter, though her old characteristics remain in suffi- cient prominence to preserve her individuality. But she knows now what affliction is, and has discovered that neither set phrases or an appeal to a sense of duty will always bring comfort to the stricken heart. She has learned, too, that God " moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform," and that our times are in his hand, and not in our own; and consequently she is more lenient than formerly in her judgments of her neighbors in their trying experiences. She is still, however, very literary, in conversation at least, and occasionally has a tilt of words with Mr. Hill, to the no small amuse- ment of listeners, and at times she acts the superior woman.   370      HERE AND HEREAFTER: As for Mr. Hill, to whom has been given by no means the prominent place in this narrative which he occupies in N--, he has borne Miss Annie's engagement with a degree of philosophy highly creditable to his pro- fession as well as his equanimity. Miss Ellis is obliged to confess in her heart that she was probably mistaken in fancying he ever entertained a. particular partiality for her ward. Mrs. Brown continues the good Samaritan of N---, going about among the sick and poor, and ever ready with heart and hand to assist' those who are in need and affliction. When her last hour shall come, it is not too much to anticipate for her the commendation, "Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Mrs. Harris- is Mrs. Harris still, so entirely a surface character that one is disposed to wonder if she has any inner or hidden life. She has been to Europe, and came home with such lovely half-mourning from Paris, and can talk so fluently too, a la guide-book, of the sights and sounds of her travels, that she is quite a marvel to the satellites that revolve in her sphere. Mr. Green, after his return from the house of cor- rection, kept sober for a few weeks; but he soon re- lapsed into his old habits again, and all that Mrs. Black and his daughter Ann could do were ineffectual to stay him in his downward course. At last, finding himself under such close surveillance at home, he one day went away from the village, leaving behind him a wretched scrawl, to the purport that he was tired of being watched and followed, and no one need go on his track now, for he could not be found. Efforts were made by Mr. Norton, however, to discover where he had gone, but he had been too wary. So Miss Ellis took Ann home to her own house, where she is in a fair way to mature into   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       371 a good, reliable girl, and will doubtless prove an efficient aid to Miss Annie, who is her embodiment of all that is beautiful and excellent. A great improvement is ap- parent in the manners of Ann, though she is by no means an entirely changed character yet. She still finds it somewhat difficult to manage very correctly the Queen's English, and is quite apt to call Mrs. Miss. She also retains some of her former vagrant habits, and at times yawns and stretches and groans over her sewing, after the manner of girls of like early training. Mrs. Norton took Sammy to her own home, intending, after the education she proposes to give him has been com- pleted, to have him fitted for whatever occupation he discovers an aptness for. It is one of those balmy days in June, when Na- ture in her fresh summer beauty seems to the grateful heart to be uttering praises to the Most High. Mrs. Fitzroy, whose married life we have followed for five years in these pages, sits in her morning room, which has recently been refurnished in a style of greater lux- ury than formerly. She has lost nearly all the radiant brilliancy of her bridal days, but still she is what in fashionable parlance would be called a very elegant, stylish-looking woman. A weary, listless expression is upon her face, which, however, lights up with a fitful glow as Mrs. Harris is announced, and the two ladies soon engage in one of those never-ending discussions upon dress, fashion, places of summer recreation, and news, which form the staple of conversation with so many persons,--for they are now. very fast friends; and al- though Mrs. Fitzroy in her heart despises Mrs. Harris on account of her inane weaknesses of character, she finds a refuge from serious and troubled thoughts in listening to her ceaseless flow of words.   372      HERE AND HEREAFTER: And is this, it may be asked, the result upon Mrs. Fitz- roy of her child's death, and the weeks of convalescence, during the long hours of which conscience would not be silenced nor reflection stilled? Was there no change wrought in her character by such experiences? At first her cousin, whose devotion to her was untiring, thought that there was; she appeared so sad and calm, and spoke with so much deep feeling of her child, and seemed to regret so sincerely her weakness in giving way to the nurse in his management, and listened with such apparent interest to her when she endeavored to, withdraw her mind from her trials here to the unfading  joys of hereafter. But as her health and spirits re- turned, old habits and modes of feeling returned also; and soon it became evident to Mrs. Norton that no radi- cal change had been wrought in Mrs. Fitzroy's charac- ter, and also that her own society was becoming irksome, and an evident restraint upon her. Alas! the spirit of worldliness had not yet been ex- orcised from the breast of Clara Fitzroy, so thoroughly had it taken possession there! Erysichthon, according to mythologic story, so of- fended the goddess Ceres by his impiety, that she caused  the spirit of famine to be breathed into him, so that all lIis life long his insatiable appetite would never be sat- isfied. To obtain the means of appeasing his hunger after his property had all been exhausted, he sold his only daughter again and again into slavery, she being every time miraculously restored to him; but not being able in this way to obtain enough for his wants, he was finally compelled, in the extremity of his aggravated -voracity, to devour his own limbs. This fable is no inapt emblem of the condition of those who have suf- fered themselves to become filled with the cormorant spirit of worldliness, which is ever crying Give, give! and   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.       373 will not be satisfied,- that spirit which sacrifices the nearest and dearest objects of interest to the gratifica- tion of its own desires; that spirit which, finally failing of all other nourishment, preys upon itself, until soul and body both are miserably destroyed. What Mrs. Fitzroy's future will be can only be par- tially inferred from what her past has been and what her present is. One fact with regard to her should here be named, - she has solemnly pledged her word to her husband that she will henceforth abstain from those habits which have been the bane of her happiness and had well-nigh proved fatal to 'her life. Whether she will be able to hold to her resolution when temptations come remains to be seen. Are any of my readers disposed to say that Clara Fitzroy is an unusual and an exaggerated instance of the results of worldliness? Common it is to be hoped such instances are not, but actual it is believed they are. Indeed, can it be denied that there are lower depths of degradation and vice down to which the un- natural excitements and temptations of fashionable life often sink its votaries,-- excitements and temptations which every right-minded and judicious parent must fear for her daughters far more than the pestilence which, thougli it destroy the body, cannot destroy the soul? Purity of mind and heart! What is more to be de- sired for the young? And how can that purity, as a general remark, be preserved without blemish in those who are suffered to enter unrestrained into much of the fashionable society of the present day? Some there are, it is true, who, like the saintly Godiva or the lady in Comus, are so clothed upon with chastity that their guileless natures suffer no harm from dangerous expos- ures,-- 32   374      HERE AND HEREAFTER: "So dear to heaven is saintly chastity, That when a soul is found sincerely so A thousand liveried angels lackey her, Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt." Such as these may escape unscathed from unhallowed contacts and associations, but it is a fearful ordeal for even them to pass through; and such natures are rare. Reflect upon these things, parents and guardians, before you expose your daughters to the temptations of the gay world; to the insidious flatteries of the unprin- cipled, to the honeyed words of those whose private lives you would blush to have them know, to the in- delicate contiguity of the polka, to the sparkling allure- ments of the wine-cup. Reflect on these things, if you would have those for whose stainless characters you are largely responsible follow the poet's injunction: - "Yet as thy tender years depart, Keep that white and innocent heart." As for Mr. Fitzroy, he is essentially the same man he has been for years; still living in God's fair world with- out a thought of his loving-kindness; alike insensible to his smiles and his frowns; alike turning a deaf ear to the still small voice and to the thunder tones of his displeasure. Sufficient for himself is he now and here. But how will it be hereafter? Thus has it been written in the divine oracles: "Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet...... And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it." On this beautiful June day Delia Norton too is in her private room, which wears the same peaceful aspect as it did five years ago. On her fair face, radiantly   OR, THE TWO ALTARS.      375 beautiful, for the spirit within is shining out there and almost transfigures the human into the divine, are smiles and tears. It is the return of a season fraught to her with sad and sweet memories. Once more we may glance at those pages which contain the record of her daily experiences of joy and sorrow, while yet the ink is fresh, and the paper is wet with recent tears. ". .... This is the fourth anniversary of the birth of my little George, my child-angel, who was accounted worthy to be called to his Saviour's fold. O darling! God will surely pity a mother's weakness, if she weeps for herself while she rejoices for the redeemed one. My little three-weeks-old Edward has been given me in. place of my risen one. For this added gift, and all my other manifold blessings, would I praise thee out of a full heart, O my Heavenly Father! Strengthen me in ac- tive service here, that I may be prepared to meet the summons before thy throne hereafter." "Active service here!" This was the law of the house at Rosedale, and is doubtless the law of the house in many and many another home in our land, under lofty roofs and within lowly cottage walls, situated amid the city's din and far back in the country embowered among hills and valleys. We rejoice in the belief, that, while there are those among the affluent who live for present enjoyment alone, whose extravagant and luxu- rious habits are fast bringing ruin upon themselves, and are injuring more than can be estimated the good name of their native land, there are others in like cir- cumstances who labor in season and out of season in the same divine work in which the Saviour wrought with such self-sacrificing love and obedience, having him for their example, and remembering his declara- tion: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." And i  /   376      HERE AND HEREAFTER. still with true .Christian' zeal they must labor on, and bravely stem the current which now sets everywhere so strongly against them. So have labored Leslie and Delia Norton in their united lives, and the chapter of their history which is now before my readers, it is believed, is a true index of those which shall follow. A summary of the good deeds they have already done is needless, if an interest has been awakened in their career thus far; and as to results, eternity alone can fully declare them. Of one at least of their Christian acts they are, already reaping a full reward. Five years of careful and judicious cul- ture have so changed the little orphaned Felice, that she now would scarcely be recognized as the dark-low- ering child who came to Mamma Delia. True, hers was a generous soil, and one which bore good fruit in return for the labor bestowed upon it. But it must be remem- bered that the richest soil, if neglected, is only prolific of the most rank and unwholesome growths. Now she is a comfort to her adopted mother and uncle, and a loving, tender elder sister to the little Helen and baby Edward, and though by no means faultless, gives fair promise of a- rich, ripe womanhood. To those who are now balancing between the service of the world and the service of heaven, and considering whether they may not engage in the one and not fail of the other, all that can be said is what the Son of God himself has declared: - "No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other: ye cannot serve God and mammon." THE END. i    "This is   a  Book  of Sterling   imerit." STEP BY STEP; OR, DELIA ARLINGTON. A FIRESIDE STORY. BY ANNA ATHERN.

IT can only be necessary that the purpose and treatment of this "FIRESIDE STORY" should be known to secure for it a welcome entrance into thousands of homes. It is just such a book as the Christian mothers of the land must be glad to place in the. hands of their daughters, as they are entering upon womanhood. For notices of this volume, see the following Extracts which have appeared - "I thank yolu for sending me that capital book, 'Step by Step,' &c. If this be the first effort of the fair authoress, as I suppose, she has succeeded admirably. I should put it into the hands of a youthful inquirer in religion with more confidence than half, ay, than scarce any of the books expressly written for that purpose. Its genial, yet elevated tone; its fine sketches or delineations of character; its rational yet earnest spirit; its life-like, natural, unexagger. ated picture; its genial religiousness-strike me mightily." -Extract of a Letter from Rev. F. A. Farley.   2          STEP BY STEP. "This is a book of sterling merit. We hope the volume will be extensively read. Our own children have already made a meal of it- somewhat taken aback to find at the close, that Delia, albeit some seventeen years old, is not yet married. We commend the book as eminently interesting and valuable."-- The Congregationalist. "The story now before us comes from a New England mind and heart. The author was reared under the generous and impartial influences of New England culture, and is a genuine- woman. We can cordially testify, that, in all the personal qualities that underlie every true composition, this writer is entitled to full confidence and respect. The book itself will be sure to engage the reader's lively attention, and improve the heart. First of all its merits is a thorough and consistent Christian purpose. There is no sickly sen- timent, nor mawkish piety, nor literal moral; but a natural, breathing, fervent faith, warms and inspires the whole,- decided, yet genial; special, and yet practical; rational, yet evangelical. Then the emotions that are brought into play are real emotions, such as all of us have felt, and such as befit the occasions and scenes that excite them. The chain of incident is woven with a good degree of ingenuity. 'Character unfolds, is tried, grows, ripens, according to the laws of human experience. Good and evil appear what they are, and the victories of the former over the latter are legitimate victories.' . There is nothing to foster false-views, or feed a romantic fancy." "More brilliant descriptions, and more exciting situa- tions, can easily be had; but by those who love to see the action of truth in familiar forms, and the beauty of a sincere and honest soul amidst such trials and temptations as belong to the world of fact, clothed in the colors of a chaste imagination, ' Delia Arlington' will be appreciated. The dialogue is remarkable for the absence of the formal phraseology and strained stateliness of the fashionable novel,   s'tBP Bn sTsP.        3 the books examined for winter reading and holiday gifts, let this find a place."- Rev. Dr. Huntington's Monthly Re. ligious Magazine. "The gradual development of an excellent character is here strikingly portrayed. It is a book of superior power, and exhibits a deep insight into the human heart. As a book for the fireside, it will accomplish much good, and de- serves a wide circulation." Zion's Herald. "This story is designed to illustrate the gradual develop- ment of the religious principle in the different virtues and graces of the Christian life. The author possesses fine descriptive powers, and knows how to combine circum. stances in a manner to secure the highest effect. It is an unpretending, well written, and agreeable book." - Puritan Recorder. "This is one of the stories, which, beginning to read, we like to pursue; and we pursue it with increasing interest. It is one of the best books of this description, and though it is designed primarily for the young, all ages will be profited by the reading of it." - Christian Freeman. "This story was written to meet a want both at the fire. side and in the Sunday school - library. Though designed for the young, it will, we feel quite sure, be read with pleasure and profit by the parents and guardians of the young, who fear the effects of highly wrought fictions on their excited minds. It is a beautifully simple story, full of the best lessons of social and -domestic life ."- Hunt's Mer- chants Magazine  "This is a very pleasant story, written by a genuine New England lady, and opens with a fireside scene in Buffalo, in which a father, daughter, and uncle, have each an appropriate part. It has more the aspect of actual life, or of character developid by the training of Providence,   4          ST4P IBY STEP.             than of, the inventive creation of an ingenious/:mind, and hence we think the entertainment it affords may be indulged in .without danger, and its fictions enjoyed with safety to truth and virtue." - New York Chronicle. -t' The style is natural and pleasing, and in parts of the book-there is a genuine pathos, which will be felt in reading it, biut which'cannot be described. It is a volume which every .mother may gratefully place in the hands of her daughters."- Boston Evening Gazette. "It is a practical, genial book, devoid of everything like cant, or mawkish sentiments. The dialogue is exceedingly well managed; it is natural, and flows on like the conver- sation of intelligent persons. The aim of the authoress seems to have been to produce a work of an elevated tone, that would be of moral service by those who perused it. We commend ' Delia Arlington' to our readers, with the confident assurance that the story will both please and in. struct them." - Boston Transcript. "A very pleasant story of the adventures and trials 9f a young orphan heiress. Although not particularly marked by originality, the book has such a good aim, and inculcates such Christian views of life, that we hope it will be appre- ciated as it deserves. It is probably the first attempt of a young authoress, and is quite highly recommended."-- Arthur's Home Magazine. "The writer's aim in this volume has been, by describ- ing the development of the truly religious character in one young female, to aid it in others. The varity of the scenes through which the heroine passes in city and country, and of the circumstances of sorrow and of happiness which al- ternately surround her, will render the book acceptable to those who read for pleasure; and higher'qualities will win the regard of those who read for improvement." --Christian Resister.
