                 STEP BY STEP; OR, DELIA ARLINGTON. A FIRESIDE STORY. BY ANNA ATHERN. 12mo. pp. 456. Extract from DR. HUNTINGTON'S Religious Miscellany: - "The story now before us comes from a New England mind and spirit. The author was reared under the generous and im- partial influences of a New England culture, and is a genuine woman. We can cordially testify, that, in all the personal quali- ties that underlie every true composition, this writer is entitled to full confidence and respect. The book itself will be sure to engage the reader's lively attention and improve the heart. First of all its merits is a thorough and consistent Christian purpose. There is no sickly sentiment, nor mawkish piety, nor literal moral; but a natural, breathing, fervent faith, warms and inspires the whole, -decided, yet genial; special, yet practical; rational, yet evan- gelical. Then the emotions that are brought into play are real emotions, such as all of us have felt, and such as befit the occasions and scenes that excite them. 'Character unfolds, is tried, grows, ripens according to the laws of human experience. Good and evil appear what they are, and the victories of the former over the latter are legitimate victories.' The dialogue is remarkable for the absence of the formal phraseology and strained stateliness of the fashionable novel, and sounds like the talk of living men alid women. Among books examined for winter reading and holiday gifts, let this find a place."   BOOKS FOR WINTER READING, OR PRESENTS TO YOUR FRIENDS, PUBLISHED BY JAMES MUNROE AND CO., BOSTON, AND "YCEUM  BUILDING, CAMBRIDGE, MAss.

While it has been written especially for that large class of readers,--the young,-it is hoped that it may not be devoid of interest to those of adult years. Perhaps parents and guardians of the young, who fear the effects of highly wrought and exciting fiction on their susceptible minds, may not -be un- willing to place in their hands this simple story.    STEP BY STEP; OR, DELIA    A RLINGTON. CHAPTER I. "My robe of life at first was fair And spotless as the driven snow,      'Twas flung around me gently there,  Where spirits first from Heaven do go; And white and clear it seemed to be A type of God's own purity."  FENNER. IT was a dreary, stormy, November afternoon. The rain that had fallen steadily all day, had changed to sleet, whichthe wind now risen almost to a gale, drove mercilessly against the unfortunate wayfarers, who were exposed to its fury, or rattled against the window panes of comfortable dwellings, reminding their occupants of the tempest without. As the day waned, the fury of the storm increased, and when night set in, with her pall of almost thick darkness, few even of the oldest inhabitants of that .city of gales and sudden tempests, Buffalo, could recall a more fearful night. Far different from the raging tempest without was the scene within a large and commodious mansion,   2       STEP BY STEP,- OR, situated on one of the highest elevations of the city. A bright coal fire burned in a polished steel grate, which, with the light from a shaded solar lamp, im- parted a quiet cheerfulness to the room, to which the reader is introduced. There was an air of indescrib- able comfort in this apartment, with its heavy crim- son curtains falling to the floor, its old-fashioned carved and well-filled bookcase, its comfortable chairs and easy lounges. Upon a round table drawn to- wards the fire were the remains of the evening repast, beside which, in an arm-chair, sat a gentleman ap- parently about sixty years of age, although from the white locks which covered his venerable head, he might have been older. His was one of those noble countenances, which at once give an impression of a life of pure and lofty aims, unsullied by the false code of a worldly policy, or a worldly morality. As seen now, his features in perfect repose, himself absorbed in deep thoughts his expression was almost stern. Opposite upon a couch half sat, half reclined another gentleman, somewhat past the prime of life, and bearing upon a highly intellectual countenance the marks of struggle endured as well as of victory won; for his pale high forehead was furrowed with many a line, while his mouth had an indescribably sweet, yet sad expression. His eyes were fastened with an intent, loving gaze upon a little girl, about ten years of age, who was sitting after the manner of an oriental princess, upon a soft mat before the fire busy stringing a coral necklace. She was. of fair complexion, and had deep blue eyes, and her hair fell in thick, light-brown curls over her shoulders. Her features were good, and bore a striking resemblance to those of the elder of the two   DELIA ARLINGTON.       3 gentlemen. Her figure was slight and well propor- tioned, and her motions graceful. As she sat, her head inclined over her work, her curls falling in care- less disorder about her white neck, rendered still whiter in contrast with the crimson frock she wore, she was a beautiful picture to look upon. Still there was one charm wanting to her, lovely as she was: she was not childish. Her expression, her figure, her very manner, as she drew in and out the needle through her beads, betokened early maturity. Alas! poor child! she was motherless almost from her birth, and with the intuitive perception belonging to her sex, had early learned to take upon herself those little cares, and render to others those little attentions so essential to the comfort of home. As yet neither her father, Mr. Arlington, the elder gen- tleman, nor her uncle, Mr. Howard, who with the servants constituted the family, saw that she was defrauded of that sweet spring-time of existence, a childhood without care or anxiety. By degrees Mr. Arlington aroused from his reverie, the stern lines upon his face gradually relaxed, and finally softened into a smile of wonderful beauty, as he looked towards his little daughter. "Little lady," he said presently. "Papa?" was the half questioning reply, as she still went on with her work. "Come to me, Delia." "Yes, sir," and rising sedately she put her beads carefully on the table, and smoothing back her dis- ordered curls, came to her father's knee. "Little lady, Miss Jones tells me you have out- grown her school, and she cannot teach you anything more. What shall I do with you now? Senri you   *4      STEP BY STEP,--OR1 to Madame Radeux's finishing establishment, to Mrs. Montgomery's Select school, or-" "Or what, papa?" "Or away to Boston, New York, or Philadelphia, to boarding school?" ': None of them, please papa, and oh, don't send me away from you and uncle Edward. I know Miss Jones can teach me if she chooses; she does know a great deal more than I do, papa, I am sure." "Doubtless," replied her father, smiling at his child's interpretation of what he had said; "but Miss Jones means, I suppose, that you have learned all she undertakes to teach, and, therefore, it will be necessary for you to leave her school. Do you like to study, little lady?" "Oh yes, sir, so much." "Do you like to go to school?" "Pretty well, though I don't want to go to a strange school." "Would you like to study at home, and recite your lessons to me?" "Oh, shouldn't I like it? May I? Papa; may I? I will be so good, and always have my lessons, and always be punctual." I will think about it, little lady. Now ring for Ann to take away the tea-things." Delia did not return to her beads, however; but, seeing that her father had taken up his book, went to the couch where her uncle was, and sat down on a low seat beside him. He did not speak to her at first. Looking at her thoughtfully for a few minutes, he at length said, "Do you not like to play with other children, Delia?"   DELIA ARLINGTON. "Not much, Uncle Edward. The little girls at our school are very rude, some of them, and I like sitting still and reading better than playing with them." "Yes, but it is not good for you, my birdie, to sit reading all the time, when you ought to be playing. You'll be an old woman before you are a young one. A child like you should run and frolic, and frisk like the young lambs."  "Perhaps I should if I could go alone in the woods and fields to run. I don't like rude plays. I like to go to the shore and sail on the lake. But am I so very little? Papa calls me his little lady, I know, but then I'm his little housekeeper too. In six years I shall be sixteen." "Well, what then?" "Then I can be a real housekeeper, and take all the care from good nursey, - and then I can read all the big books in papa's library, and--and perhaps then," lowering her voice, "papa will not miss dear mamma so much as he does now -at least, as I think he does; he looks so much at her portrait sometimes." "Yes, dear, no doubt he does miss her. You are very like your mother, Delia, only you are not so lively and happy as she used to be." ( Am I not, Uncle Edward? I am very happy with papa and you and good nursey, but I do sometimes wish I had a mother or some dear aunt to love beside. And I am really lively inside, uncle, you know, only it won't all come out. But isn't this a nice plan for me to study at home with papa?" "Perhaps it is, birdie. I can't tell, till it has been tried." At this moment the clock on the mantel-shelf 1*   )       STEP BY STEP, --OR struck eight, and Delia, rising from her seat, went to the table for her beads, saying, as she did so: "I meant to have finished this necklace to-night, but I didn't think bed-time would come so soon." "Whom is it for, Delia, yourself?" asked her father; ' I had not supposed you cared so much for ornaments." "Oh, no, not for me, it's for Sam's baby. Jane says it's good for babies to wear them. I don't care for such things, you know," drawing up her little figure in a most stately manner. "More's the pity," said her uncle in an undertone, which, however, did not escape Mr. Arlington. But he did not notice it until Delia, having kissed father and uncle, and bid them good night, had left the room. Then he said: "Why is it a pity, Edward, that Delia has no taste for ornaments and frivolities?" "Because it is to be expected that she should have. It is as natural for a child to like ornaments as it is for an untutored savage to delight in gay colors and bright beads. Why, brother, don't you see that child is already a woman?" "I see, Edward, that she's a very sensible child, and will, I hope, become a true woman as-" "Yes, yes, as her mother was before her; but she was not the least like Delia as a child; not like her in temperament, I am sure. It really distresses me to see a little thing like her so good and thoughtful. I say it's not natural." "I think Delia is very cheerful and happy, and I see in her the promise that, when her character is formed, she will preserve that medium so desirable between gayety and gravity,"   DELIA ARLINGTON.       7 Upon your hobby again, brother; but how, with your proposed plan of educating your child, you are to carry it out, I confess I cannot see. For instance, if now you teach her at home, with her quick percep- tion and ready talents, you'll make a pedantic blue stocking of her, without any actual knowledge of the world as it is, and with a very one-sided view of life. Will she thus in education and character be attaining to your much desired golden mean? Pardon my earnestness, brother; but I have little faith in keeping boys and girls apart from associates of their own age. This plan makes them prematurely old; prevents -them from showing their real characteristics, and consequently not knowing what they are, you cannot correct or direct them." "What would you have me do with Delia, then? If I send her to one of our fashionable schools, she will be in danger at least of imbibing the very notions I have for ten years so sedulously shielded her from. Think of that fair, pure being, the only child of my lost one, growing up like two thirds of her sex, vain, idle and frivolous, with no higher aims than to dress elegantly and marry advantageously. No, no, Ed- ward, I cannot think of it." "Your child is in the world, and she must, in some way, be a part of it. You cannot keep her from its association and some of its contaminations. You- can, however, so educate her that she shall be guarded against the evils that surround her." "Yes, that is what I hope to do; and then, when her principles are fixed, and her character formed, she can safely venture into the world's mixed tide of good and evil." "But what I maintain is, that her principles never   8    STEP BY STEP,--OR, can be fixed, nor her character formed, until she has known something experimentally of life. Educate her, as you think of doing, in this atmosphere of home love and devotion, hedge her about with a triple wall of safety from all evil, and when she does eventually go forth into the world, you and she both will be astounded to find what her real disposition and character are. Are we wiser than our Heavenly Father? Does He not send clouds as well as bright- ness upon us? Does he not allow us to meet temp- tation, as well as place incentives to goodness in our path? Nay, in this very tempest, which rages so fiercely without, and which doubtless is doing its appointed work of destruction, has He not lessons for us as easy to read, as any in the blessings He so constantly bestows?" "Allow me to say, Edward, you also take but a one-sided view of the matter. Where is the home, however safely guarded, into which affliction and sorrow enter not? Where is the home whose daily events are not disciplinary? Not this surely, where the shadow still lingers, cast upon it ten years since, when my beloved was called home." "To us, brother, yes, to me as well as to you, but with Delia it is different. Our trials, our discipline, are not hers. Let her be a child like other children, let her mingle with those, who, by rude antagonism, or sympathetic kindness, will aid in drawing out her real self." "Perhaps you are partly right, Edward, I will not say. But this winter I must try the experiment of teaching her at home. What a fearful night! Heaven protect the lake boats, if any are out." "Was not Sam to return to-day? le ought to   DELIA ARLINGTON.       9 have been in, however, before the fury of the storm commenced." At this moment a loud ring was heard at the hall door, and was repeated again and again, and Mr. Arlington himself opened it to a young woman, who was dripping wet, and whose countenance betokened some terrible fear. "Jane, is this you? AWhere is Sam?" ; Oh, sir, I don't know; the boat's not in, and they say she can't live in such a fearful night as this. Oh! sir, what shall I do; what shall I do?" "Trust in God, Jane. Not unlikely she has put in somewhere for safety. Go into the kitchen, and dry your clothes, and John shall go home with you." "I can't stop; oh no, I can't stop a minute; I left my baby all alone; oh dear, oh dear." At this moment a slight figure, in a long white night-dress, came running down stairs, and, taking hold of the poor woman's trembling cold hands, said: "Don't cry, Jane, please don't. Papa thinks Sam is safe; don't you, papa?" "I hope he is, my child, but you must go to bed. To-morrow you shall go to see Jane." "Yes, I will come to-morrow, and bring baby's necklace. Jane, now don't cry," and the little girl vanished as quickly as she had appeared. After a few more encouraging words from Mr. Arlington, Jane returned to her lonely home; and the two gentleman were again together in the com- fortable parlor. "Poor Jane," said Mr. Howard, "I hope the Swift Roe is safe." "It is a terrible night," said Mr. Arlington. "No ^   10      STEP BY STEP,---- OR, boat can be safe on the lake in such a storm, much less one of her size," and he walked backward and forward hurriedly. At last he said, s' Whatever t,* discovered fault my child has, she possesses a kind, tender heart. May she always retain it." * "Amen," said Mr. Howard, solemnly. Mr. Arlington was a lawyer of high standing and respectability, in the thriving and rapidly increasing city of Buffalo, where he had established himself upon completing his studies. Rather late in life he had married Mr. Howard's eldest sister, Delia, a very lovely and superior woman. For many years their happiness knew no alloy, save the unfulfilled wish for children. At last, however, Delia was born, and the hearts of the fond parents thrilled to the sense of new joys. But Mrs. Arlington never fully recovered her strength after the birth of her child, and an unusually stormy and inclement winter setting in, she was un- able to rally, but faded and drooped day by day in a rapid decline, and when spring came with its balmy air, and bright verdure, she was laid in her grave. Her husband, a man of deep, though silent feeling, transferred to his little one, the love which he had borne his wife in addition to the share already be- stowed upon her as his only child. Had Mr. Arlington been foolishy indulgent to his daughter, this excess of affection for her would have been highly injurious. But he loved her too wisely to err in that way, and she early learned the two great lessons so important to childhood,-- truthfulness and obedience. Mr. Howard had for some years been a resident in his brother-in-law's family, and as they both were   DELIA ARLINGTON.       " men of reserved manners and retiring habits, they seldom mingled in society, and consequently saw very few visitors at their own home. A faithful old nurse, who had lived in the family of Mr. Arlington's father, with her only daughter, Susan the cook, and John the coachman, composed the remainder of the household. I Mr. Arlington had succeeded by inheritance to a large fortune, and Delia was a prospective heiress, as well as. an only child; two conditions combining, to say the least, as many dangers as advantages. Hence her Uncle Howard's fears for her, from her present mode of life. For as she was undeniably kind hearted, and generous in her feelings, and ever ready to render unequivocal obedience to the father whom she revered, as well as loved, there was little or nothing to call forth any unamiable traits of character she might possess. . i    12      STEP BY STEP,--OR, CHAPTER    II.  "Ah me! Of our old eyes thou art the light! The joy of our old hearts art thou!" LONGFELLOW. ABOUT midnight the storm began to abate, and the next morning when the family assembled at break- fast, the sun shone with unusual brightness for a November's morning. John had gone down to the Swift Roe's landing to ascertain if there had been any tidings of her. As soon as breakfast was over, both Mr. Arlington and Mr. Howard went out upon the same errand, Delia tripping along beside them on her way to see and comfort poor Jane. She car- ried a little basket of delicacies for Sam's breakfast, as she said, and a rattle for the baby, and the unfin- ished necklace. Sam had been Mr. Arlington's coachman before his marriage with a niece of good Nurse Hanson, and was still employed by him in various jobs about the house and grounds, hence the interest felt by all the family in Sam, in Sam's neat little wife, and ,Sam's pretty six months' old baby. Mr. Howard went in for a moment with Delia to speak a hopeful word or two to Jane. She was busy getting breakfast, and although her face wore marks of tears, she did not look so despairing as on the pre- vious night. Indeed, on that bright, pleasant morn- ing, it was easy to admit hope to the heart,- that could only wait in dread and terror through the drag- ging hours of that terrible tempest.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      1j In about an hour Mr. Arlington returned, his face sad and serious, but not exactly like that of one who brings the heavy tidings of death. "Sam?" was all the poor wife could say, as she turned pale, and sat down on the nearest seat. "4 The boat is in, no lives lost, but they were in great peril. succeeding almost by a miracle in making a harbor on the coast." "But Sam, where is he?" asked Jane in that imploring accent, which begs to be told the worst at once." "In the darkness and confusion he was knocked down, and has broken his leg. They are bringing him to the house. Take heart, Jane, and let him see you with a cheerful face. We shall have him about again in a few weeks. I trust. Delia, my love, this is no place for you; here is Ann; run home, child." "Please, papa." W"What, my dear?" , "May'nt I give Sam something, something of my own every week, until he is well again?" "Yes, dear, yes." Fortunate was it for Sam, that he was in such good hands, for his injury proved to be a compound frac- ture, and the flesh was very badly mangled. It was feared he was so long exposed to the cold and rain, that the most serious consequences might result. And he never did regain his health or strength, but while he lived, he was ever after a pensioner upon Mr. Arlington's, and, after his death, Delia's bounty; bounty never withheld by either father or daughter from the needy and deserving. Wishing to cultivate a true benevolence in his child, Mr. Arlington had early-encouraged her to give 2   "      STEP BY STEP,- OR,  to the poor, from money he was accustomed to allow i her from time to time for her own private expendi-  tures; never a very large amount, but sufficient to*  enable her to form habits of self-denial, without  which there is no true charity. As she grew older,  and proved herself worthy the trust, he intended to increase the allowance, and thus educate her by degrees for the responsible position she would occupy in the future.                   Just now Delia's little head was filled with plans of what she could do for Sam's, Jane's, and baby's com- fort. Occupied with these cares, her own self-im-  posed duties at home, and her studies, among which 1 was mastering the dry rudiments of Latin, the winter  wore peacefully and rapidly away. Her father, pleased with her intellectual activity and her quiet cheerfulness, thought little of his brother-in-law's objections to his favorite plan of educating his i child, and considered it a most successful experi- : ment.  Mr. Howard, on the contrary, watched his birdie (the pet name by which he usually called her) nar- rowly, and thought that the fair little face grew more sedate, and the little erect figure more stately than ever. She still preserved the childish habit of sitting upon the soft rug, where her father so loved to see her, because her mother had provided it for this use, al- e most one of her last cares for her infant. But as it  has before been stated, her attitude there was more  that of an oriental princess than that of free, careless childhood. Even this habit she was beginning to  think she had about outgrown; for as the spring ad- vanced, and seats by the windows or on the piazza took the place of the cosy gathering around the win-   DELIA ARLINGTON.       15 ter's hearth, Delia said one morning to Ann in her uncle's presence:                  ! "Please, Ann, to put my mat away; I shall not, need it now, and indeed I'm getting too old to sit upon it any longer. But it must be taken good care of, Ann; please remember. I can't give that to Jane's baby." "And why is my birdie too old to sit on her rug any longer?" said Mr. Howard. "You're but a child yet, and not a very large one either." "I'm not very small, if you please, Uncle Edward, and I want to be a lady as soon as I can, for papa's sake and your's too. And I don't believe there's another little girl of my age who has sat on a baby's rug so many years. I wouldn't, if I didn't know papa liked to have me. Next winter I shall sit beside papa at his table and sew." There was a shade of impatience in her manner as she spoke, and a quicker flash than usual from her deep blue eye, showing that she was not altogether pleased with her uncle's remarks. Her father enter- ing the room at this moment nothing more was said. The two gentlemen soon after went out together. In the course of their walk, Mr. Howard said to Mr. Arlington: "What kind of a temper do you think Delia has?" '"What kind of a temper? I confess I never thought much about it, she is always so amiable and gentle. But why do you ask?" "Merely to ascertain if, as usual, we differ about the child. Now I think she has a, quick temper, and is proud and haughty in her feelings." "Delia quick tempered? a child so obedient and pleasant and thoughtful? She proud and haughty?   16      STEP BY STEP,--OR, The most benevolent and kind-hearted little thing I ever saw? What do you make of her devotion to Jane, and her kindness- and sympathy for the poor and suffering?"  "To you and to them, I grant she is all that; for you she respects as well as loves, and in them her kind and compassionate feelings are interested. But  I am speaking now of real characteristics, of which  neither she nor any one else may be fully aware, until  uncongenial intercourse or some new experience shall  reveal their existence. Gunpowder is very harmless  so long as it is kept from the fatal spark, which often  gives it a terrible power of evil. Yonder lake is most lovely this calm Spring morning, but let one of our westerly gales arise, and how great a change is  immediately wrought in it!" "I thought, Edward, you were a student of books s more than of character; yet how you seem to have studied that child and discovered traits in her which  I, her own father, have never detected."  "My youth and early manhood, brother, were as unlike yours as possible. The remembrance of much of my experience during that period of my life makes  me keen-sighted to find out latent dispositions in one,  in whom I am so much interested as in Delia. Indeed she is to me as well as to you, the one absorbing object of affection. If she could only live and do as  other children do!" "Well, well, Edward, I will forthwith see Mrs. Greene about taking her as a day scholar. And yet I cannot bear to think of my child transformed into a. pert, disagreeable school-girl." "As much as I should dislike that, it would not be so great a trial to me as seeing her growing up to   DELIA ARLINGTON.      17 mature life with qualities and feelings daily gathering strength, which, besides being a constant source of unhappiness, will render her unwomanly and un- lovely. Now you can correct her faults, or aid her in doing it, provided you can only know what they are. And our lives, brother, are uncertain." The hext morning after breakfast, Mr. Arlington, calling Delia to him, said: "Well, little lady, I have concluded to send you to school again, and I wish you to be prepared to go next Monday." "Yes, papa, but -  But what, little lady?" "An I troublesome to you, sir? I like to study at home dearly." "No, not at all troublesome, but we, Uncle Edward and I, think it will be better for you to be a little more away from us, and among other children. And I want you to try to find some little friends to love and play with." "I will if you wish it, papa; but I don't care about any playmates but you and uncle." Her father smiled and said,. "We are rather ad-  vanced in life to be playmates to such a little lady as you. You will go to Mrs. Greene's school until the  summer vacation, then we will have a pleasant jour- ney together, and after that perhaps I will give you the choice of returning to her or studying with me. Mind, it is only perhaps." To school accordingly Delia went, and in a short time her uncle noticed with a good deal of satisfac- tion, that she began to take more interest in childish sports, and that she and Mary Grey, the child of one of her mother's valued friends, were constant corn- 2*   18      STEP BY STEP,--OR, panions. It was quite amusing, however, to observe how Delia, while she entered into the sports of her merry -little friend with a right good relish, would all at once leave some lively play, when at its height, and, drawing herself up in her stately fashion, say: "Don't you think, Mary, we're most too old to be so rude?" "Old? no indeed. I never want to be too old to play hide and go seek; it's such nice fun." "Ftun to you, I dare say, but I don't care much about it. Is that because I am a little old wolmlan, as Susan Frost calls me?" "Oh, never mind Susan, she's always calling names. Now, Delia, I do think you like to play as well as anybody, if you could only forget what you are about. Run and hide, Delia, and I will find you." It was after one of these exciting games that Delia came in one summer evening and threw herself, all flushed and panting, upon the couch, saying: "O dear, I've had such a good frolic." "There," said Mr. Howard, triumphantly, " that's the most natural, childish thing 1 ever heard you say, Delia. Bravo, you're improving." "Oh I like to play with Mary, but she isn't like the other girls. Only think, papa, Susan Frost asked me to-day why I didn't dress more, when you are so rich. I told her you didn't like to have me dress a great deal; you didn't think it a good way to spend money. Then she laughed, and said if she had as much pocket money as I, she would have a breast- pin. She's a silly girl, I think." "What she thinks you are, little lady, I dare say."    DELIA ARLINGTON.'      19 "She does, I know; but then I'm not silly, am I, papa?" "Heydey, Miss Vanity, how do you know you are not?" 4"Because I think just as you do, and I know you're never silly." "Well, my dear, 1 think you should try to like all your school-mates; it is not good to be fastidious. Do you think just as I do now?"  "I think you are right, but I don't think it very easy to love them all." Delia's school life, however, was of short duration. Late in the term an epidemic prevailed among Mrs. Greene's boarding scholars, and little Mary Grey was one of the first sufferers of her day scholars. She was very dangerously sick, and for several days her life was despaired of. Others being attacked with the same disease, there was a general panic among the parents and friends of the pupils, and her father was induced to take Delia home before the close of the term. In fact, Mr. Arlington's heart was so bound up in his child, that he was exceedingly unwilling to intrust her education to any one else. He had only been induced to do it at all out of respect to his brother-in-law's view, and from the conviction that it might do her good to mingle more with children. Mr. Howard ceased to urge the subject, although his opinion remained unchanged, the correctness of which subsequent events proved. It must not be supposed from Delia's remarks about dress to her school-mate, Susan Frost, that Mr. Ar- lington was indifferent to his daughter's'personal appearance. On the contrary, he was scrupulous in   20      STEP BY STEP,--OR,  exacting attention not only to neatness, but also to' the fashibn and hue of her garments. In winter he loved to see her attired in the' rich glowing colors so  suited to her age, and so becoming to her fair com-  plexion. In summer she wore pretty prints and mus- lin of some simple leaf, vine or flower pattern, or she was dressed in white with blue ribbons. Silks and  jewelry he considered as inappropriate to a child, as  they were needless; their own peculiar charms of purity, freshness and vivacity, rendering superfluous  extraneous ornaments or embellishments.  Perhaps Mr. Arlington's views, like those of many  another reflective person, were more decided on the  matter of dress than they would have been, had he  not perceived the tendency to luxury and extrava- gance so rapidly increasing in the country; in which respects the city of his child's birth was by no means behind the times. It was also a matter of principle as well as of taste with him. Holding himself ac- l countable for a wise use of the riches God had in- trusted to his stewardship, he had never allowed  himself in any extravagant expenditures. EBvery- thing in and about his house bore marks of taste i and comfort, but nothing of the great wealth he  possessed. A large proportion of his annual income  was expended unostentatiously upon his poor and suffering fellow creatures. By example as well as precept he was educating  his daughter to understand the true value of money.  Knowing that the possession of wealth was not the bed of roses it is so often considered to be, he foresaw that there would be difficulties and temptations in the  path of his child as great, if widely different, as any    DELIA ARLINGTON.      21 which-beset the poor and oppressed. He believed, moreover, that to whom much is given, of them much is required; and that it is as hard a task to keep the heart pure, and the soul unsullied from the pride, arrogance and selfishness of wealth, as from the dis- content, jealousy and fretfulness of poverty.   -***   STEP BY STEP--OR, ;I CHAPTER    III. t Wandering unknown in the land of the stranger, a Be with all travellers in sickness or danger, a Guard thou their path, guide their feet from the snare,i Hear!

"Oh, if you please, sir, I should like above all things  to go to Trenton Falls, they must be so lovely.

"Oh, yes, sir, I never shall forget that. Wasn't it grand? Only think, Uncle Edward, they were mak- ing repairs on the bridge, and When we got part way over, we were obliged to walk -some distance on a single plank. On either side I could look way down,  down, to the rushing waters below. It made me a  little giddy, but I liked it, although papa thought I should be afraid. I wasn't afraid. I like high moun- tains, steep precipices, and everything of the sort. How I should like to go to the White Mountains,   where Mary Grey went last summer. You will stay at Trenton a week or two, won't you, papa."  "If you wish it, little lady, provided we go there. But as Uncle Edward did not travel with us last   UDilElA ARILINU JN. UQO year, it is only fair that he should be consulted with reference to our route this year." "Well, uncle, would'nt you like to go to Tren- ton?" "Very much, my birdie." To Trenton accordingly they went, and established themselves quietly at the excellent inn. Day after day, and evening after evening, found them exploring that most romantic and picturesque region. The variety of the scenery seemed to them inexhaustible. As they rambled up and down the creek, they were con- stantly falling upon new objects of interest. Some- times they would sit for hours on some projecting rock, where the troubled waters almost laved their feet, looking at the cascades as they appeared to chase each other in a never ceasing race, playfully flinging aloft the wreaths of mist, which sparkled and glanced in the sun like diamonds; on either side of them high walls of limestone, now perpendicular, now rough and jagged, with broad ledges and dark caverns, while far above towering to the sky, rose the dark pine forests in solemn grandeur. Again from some lofty height, which required alike skill and courage to scale, they would look down upon the cataracts, tumbling and leaping below them, some in frolicsome mood, others as if in very strife. Delia never tired, springing like a young fawn from rock to rock in the bed of the creek, where, as was the case in some places, there was only a narrow black stream running through it, or climbing eminen- ces for some new view.  One day the three were at a part of the ravine, where the water is quite deep, and the scene below is one of great gloom and grandeur. Mr. Arlington ,  , X?   24      STEP BY STEP,--OR,  and Mr. Howard had been planning a descent into the yawning chasm by moonlight, when upon look-  ing round they discovered Delia had left them. Im- mediately filled with consternation, Mr. Arlington  started in one direction, and Mr. Howard in another in search of the lost one, calling to her at every step.  Presently Mr. Arlington heard her crying out, "Papa, papa, come here," and turning an angle in the rocky  precipitous path, he was pursuing with cautious, but  hurried steps, he saw her at a short distance from him, high up on one of the steep banks, her face  turned towards him, and resting-for support against  what appeared to be a half up-rooted shrub, being in ; fact a stunted pine tree, and within one or two feet of the very brink of a fearful precipice, while in the deep chasm below, with hoarse and sullen murmur ?* rolled the dark flood. Mr. Arlington was at first paralyzed with terror. ': He saw nothing but inevitable destruction before his daughter, if the tree to which she clung should give way. From where he stood, there was no possible way of reaching her, the rocks below shelving over the gulf, so that a footing was wholly impracticable. j Going to her from above, was equally out of the ques- tion, for no foot less light than that of an agile child X could have descended the side as far as she had ven- tured.             I "Above, papa. I can hold till you come." Almost frantic, Mr. Arlington rushed up the steep, narrow path, while an unuttered prayer of agonized  petition rose from his heart. A smooth projecting rock had tempted Delia a rod or two away from her father and uncle, promising as it did, a more perfect view of the gulf below. She  -       i   DELIA ARLINGTON.       25 had incautiously gone too near the edge, and, step- ping on what proved to be a slippery, and loose stone, she was only saved from inevitable death by catching at the little pine tree, against which she was still sup- porting herself, in fearful jeopardy. Fortunately it was a cool afternoon for the season, and Mr. Arlington had worn his cloak, and as the only practicable way of rescuing his daughter from her peril, which suggested itself to him, he tied a large silk handkerchief round his waist, into which he doubled another, and giving the two ends to Mr.  Howard who had now joined him, he approached as near as it was safe to Delia, and, reaching down the cloak to her, to which he held with bpth hands, called to her to grasp it carefully and firmly. Commanding himself to speak cheerfully, he said: "Now, my child, cling fast to this, and you are safe."  Oh, I will, I will, papa," she answered with cour- ageous determination, and immediately added," now I am ready, papa." With a firm and steady hand, Mr. Arlington com- menced drawing, while Mr. Howard, standing farther back firmly braced, supported him, and in a moment he had the inexpressible happiness of folding his daughter once more in his arms, as one snatched from the very jaws of death. But no sooner was he as- sured of her safety, than he fainted.  Although Delia, with the happy elasticity of child- hood, soon recovered from the shock the imminent danger she had been in gave her, it was not so with her father. After his fainting fit, he was so exhaust- ed and worn with contending emotions, that it was some days before he was in a condition to travel. 3                 *  '  -1 -                i   26      STEP BY STEP,--OR,        A Consequently, instead of prolonging their journey to New York City, to visit Mr. Arlington's only sister, Mrs. Grafton7 as they had contemplated, they return-  ed as soon as his health would allow to Buffalo. I cannot think, Uncle Edward," said Delia, a day or two after her escape, "why father has made me  promise not to go to the Falls again. Must I not look once on my little cascade, the wee one of all, uncle, that you said was like me, taking its little  leap in such a grave fashion." "No, my child, no, do not think of going there again, it would distress your father exceedingly. Does my birdie, realize," cotinued Mr. Howard, draw-  ing his niece fondly towards him, "how great, how very great her peril was there? And what'a sad, sad thing it would have been to us if she had not been saved." "But I was not afraid, Uncle Edward, I knew papa would save me, only I did get tired holding on. Yes, once I was afraid, that was when I caught hold of a large stone and it gave way and rolled down into the gulf, and I heard it splash. Then I thought I might fall into it next, and I should, had  it not been for the little tree at which I caught that instant. Did you notice, Uncle Edward, how very ; few trees and shrubs were growing on the bank where I fell?"                   i "Yes, my dear, there is very little soil there, only  the mere handfuls washed down from above by the rains, which have caught in the crevices and rough  places of the rocks. My dear child, I have looked i since at the place where you fell, there is not another  tree or shrub within a rod of the one to which you  held. Why was it, do you think, that you should have fallen just where you did?  ........    DELIA ARLINGTON.      27 "I don't know, sir, unless it was what you and papa call providential. Do you think it was, Uncle Edward?" "I do, my dear; the good God, who watches over all his children, has saved you for some wise ends beyond what we see or know from that great peril. I hope you will never forget it, and that you will never again, needlessly or carelessly, risk a life so dear to us." "I did n't think I was running any risk, uncle. It was easy getting there, and looked so safe. I did n't mean to disobey papa; do you think I did?" No, my birdie, I do not," said Mr. Howard smil- ing at her earnestness., "I only wished to warn you to be more cautious in the future." "Do you know, uncle, though 1 am sorry papa is not well, I am so glad we are going home to Buffalo, instead of going to New-York?" "Why so, my dear? I think it would be well for you to go there, and perhaps very pleasant to know your aunt and cousins. One of them, I understand, is about your age."  "Yes, I know, but I want to go home to see Mary Grey; and besides, they are all strangers to me there." "I am afraid, my birdie, that you do not cultivate a wide liking, as I once heard an estimable friend say of another." "What is that, uncle?" "You are disposed to be interested in only a few persons. While you have your father and uncle with you, you may not feel it to be an evil, but we shall not always be here, my child. When we are gone, if you have no other friends to whom you can look, you will be very solitary."   28      STEP BY STEP,--OR,  ', "I don't want to think about that bad time, uncle. What's the use? May be I shall go first, and if I don't, why I shall have Mary Grey." "Here a little, and there a little," thought Mr. Howard, "line upon line, precept upon precept. What I say to Delia makes little apparent impression now, but perhaps it will take root, and at some futuire time bear fruit." "Home, sweet home,?' sang Delia with a degree of liveliness unusual to her, as she ran into the house , on the afternoon of their return from Trenton, hearti- ly kissing Nurse Hanson. "( Is home, then, so very dear to you, my child?" said Mr. Arlington, almost sadly, as the little graceful figure of his daughter flitted about from place to place, as if greeting each familiar object. "The dearest place in the world, papa," was the quick response, " and I am to stay at home now, am I not, if I'll be good and study with you? Please say yes, papa." "If you wish it, my child." "Wish it? Indeed I do; and now Uncle Edward shall say nothing more about my going way to   ! school. , Promise me you won't." "No, no, birdie, I won't."  And thus ended all discussion about Delia's going from home to school. As the winter approached,   ; Mr. Arlington's health continued very feeble, and Delia devoted herself to him with a love and thought- fulness, touching to behold in one so young, flitting ? about him noiselessly, ever on the watch to wait upon ? and assist him. As the cold season advanced, how- a ever, he began to improve again, and seemed to be in . a fair way of recovering his accustomed strength. Mr. *   ji::l   DELIA ARLINGTON.       29 Howard watched him  narrowly all the time, and fancied he detected in him symptoms of declining vigor and energy, but he said nothing, as his brother- in-law appeared purposely to avoid conversation on the subject. And so Delia grew, nurtured in an atmosphere of love and indulgence, and scarcely knew the meaning of sorrow, till her little friend Mary Grey died. She had never been quite well since her severe sickness the preceding summer, and a violent cold in the Tinter caused an inflammation of the lungs, which terminated fatally in a few days. By her death, the only link that connected Delia to those of her own age and sex seemed to be sundered. As the life of this carefully cherished and guarded young girl was now as unvaried and even in its flow, as it was peaceful and happy, we pass over a period of three years in its history, being marked by few events which could add anything to the interest of this narrative. 8".               .   30       STEP BY STEP, - OR, CHAPTER IV.                1 : His youth was innocent; his riper age  Marked with some act of goodness every day;    - And watched by eyes that loved him, calm, and sage,  Faded his late declining years away.

FOUR years have passed since the events recorded in the opening chapter of this story, and again Mr. Arlington, Mr. Howard, and Delia are seated in the parlor, and the cheerful fire again burns in the grate, for the evening is damp and chilly. But time has been busy at his work with at least two members of the family, ripening the full ear for the harvest, and bringing the tender blade into greater beauty and  maturity.  Mr. Arlington's noble figure is bowed,  and the white locks upon his venerable head are  whiter and thinner than they were then, and his  cheeks are fallen and pale, as if some fatal disease   : was preying on his system. But the child is now a    ;2 fair and slender girl, a woman already in the thought-  ful maturity of her countenance. She sits beside  her father at his table, busy at some light work, and  ever and anon, as he seems lost in thought, she raises  her blue eyes anxiously to his face. With Mr. How-    1 ard time has dealt gently, and four years have left  scarcely any additional wrinkle on his brow, or furrow  in his face. His sad, sweet gaze is fastened on the  father and the child in turn. A strange silence has  i; fallen upon all the group, unbroken save by the tick-  ing of the mantel clock, or the coal and ashes dropping  s In B A   DELIA ARLINGTON.      31 from the grate. At length, Mr. Arlington suddenly looking up, met Delia's anxious, almost tearful glance.    - "Yes, my child, you are right," he said, "it is even so." "Oh, father! father!" "Yes, Delia," he went on, "my days on earth are numbered, and I must speak to you now while I may; for the day and the hour when my summons shall come, knoweth no man. Nay, my child," see- ing that she was weeping bitterly, "you must be calm. The only sting in the thought of death to me is, that I must leave you. Be brave, and help me to say, 'Thy will be done.'" With great effort Delia dried her tears, and became outwardly composed, but there was a bright flush on her cheek, and her eyes were like blue violets after a shower. "I have this day, my child, completed the arrange- ment of all my temporal affairs, and I wish to con- verse with you and your uncle respecting them. I have appointed your uncle your sole guardian, knowing that this would be most agreeable to you. I have left you, my daughter, heiress to half my for- tune; the other half, as my will will show, I have appropriated to an object in which I have long been interested. After my death, it will be optional with you to remain here with your uncle and nurse, or to reside a year with your Aunt Grafton in New York, and then a year with your Aunt Leslie in R Massachusetts; at the expiration of the two years choosing a home, with the advice of your uncle, in one or the other of the two families. My preference is, that you should do the latter. This you perceive   j42      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, is what I prefer, but I do not make it a request or a  stipulation. I do not wish to bind my child to what  may prove unpleasant to her. In either family, I' have no doubt you will be kindly received, and ten-  derly cared for, and however trying it may be to your feelings to go among strangers, I think you will find it in the end for your happiness." "But no one can supply Uncle Edward's place to me; must I leave him, father, and -"  "And lose me too? you would say. There is no must about it, my love; you will be safe in following your uncle's advice. To him I leave you as a most' sacred legacy. Edward, do you accept the trust?" Mr. Howard had been sitting with his head bowed   to his breast during this most unexpected conversa - tion; he now arose, and coming gravely forward, and  laying his hand solemnly upon Delia's head, said : "I do, brother, and God help me to be a father to her when her own father shall be called hence."   ; "Amen," responded Mr. Arlington, solemnly.  Awhile longer the three sat' conversing quietly, al-  most cheerfully, and then, after the usual evening  prayers, Delia came to her father's side to bestow and receive the good night kiss. She was very sad, and she lingered long, as if unwilling to leave him. At  length, Mr. Arlington said:             "Go, my love, and seek for strength where alone it is to be found. Your Heavenly Father will never  fail you, if you trust in Him, even if in his infinite  wisdom  he takes from you your earthly parent. Now go, I wish to be alone with your uncle."  "Father," and Delia nerved herself to speak, "I will do as you wish, and will always remember the example you have set nm,"   J JJ nL lJAtL1 U J VlU * .JJU "God bless you, my darling, and He will bless and protect you; of that I have the fullest assurance." After Delia had retired, the two gentlemen sat for some moments apparently absorbed in painful thought. The silence was at length broken by Mr. Howard, who said: "Brother, are you indeed failing so rapidly?" "Edward," replied Mr. Arlington, " my life is not worth an hour's purchase, so frail is the thread whereon it hangs. For the last three years I have suffered from a disease which my physicians have repeatedly told me may prove fatal at any moment; but until recently I have not felt myself to be in im- mediate danger. Now a voice bids me to prepare to meet my God." "Is it possible, brother? And you have kept this suffering a secret from us; to what end - from me at least?" "To spare you any unnecessary anxiety. The commencement of my disease I date from the shock I received at Delia's terrible peril at Trenton Falls. Oh, Edward, when I saw my darling child hanging almost over that precipice, a frail branch her only pro- tection from immediate death, and that a death too fearful to dwell upon, the pulses of my life almost stood still in my heart, my brain reeled, and I should have fallen to the earth but for the necessity that was upon me to rescue her. That accomplished, I fainted, you know, for the first time in my life. But never tell this to my child. I see her now as she was clinging to that slender shrub, her curls waving in the breeze, her hat half off her head, her face deadly pale, but serene and resolute as she said, 'I can hold on, papa, till you come to me."'   34      STEP BY STEP,--OR, And Mr. Arlington covered his face with his hands and groaned aloud. "Do not dwell upon that now, brother," said Mr. Howard. "May I ask," he continued, abruptly changing the subject, "why you have left but half your fortune to Delia?" "To promote her own happiness, Edward. You know my views; that in that golden mean which    i poets have sung, and wise men extolled, and Scrip- ture commlended, lies the most assured prospect of happiness. In fortune, in education, in religion, in  each and all I would choose the golden mean, if it i were mine to order her lot in life for my daughter,- !: in fortune, that she might not have the cares, the anxieties, and above all the temptations inseparable alike from great riches and extreme poverty,--in ed- ucation, that she might neither rise too far above her j sex to find sympathy with them, or fall too far below I them for the proper fulfilment of her duties,--and in ! religion, that she may escape lukewarm indifference on the one hand, and a bigoted, intolerant zeal on the other."                       "All very fair in theory," Mr. Howard replied,   "but so long as great wealth, splendid talents, and  what you may consider misguided zeal in religion, have accomplished such world-known results, we may ! conclude that Providence is wiser than you would   be. I know not how you are to fit Delia to your procrustean bed. She is born heiress to a large for- tune; she has, or I greatly err, talents of no ordinary stamp, that will raise her above Ihe majority of her sex; and a heart so large and generous, united to great energy of will, that when religion shall have claimed her as a child of adoption, she will choose no   DELIA ARLINGTON.      35 half way path in which to follow her heavenly teach- ings. Some natures, my dear sir, are born to rise above mediocrity, and fill with honor and usefulness: the highest stations in life. These stations are to be filled by somebody; why not by Delia as well as by any other?" "They will be," was the reply, " if such is the will of heaven; but in my heart I crave an humbler des- tiny for her. As it is, she will have ample means at her own disposal, and I do not fear but she will make good use of them." Farther conversation ensued upon business mat- ters, when again Mr. Arlington requested Mr. Howard not to speak to his daughter of his disease, or its probable cause. "Let there be no leave takings," he continued, "between us, no parting words. Love such as ours requires it not, and I could not bear it. When I am called I trust it will be at once." When Mr. Howard left him at the door of his sleeping-room, he said: "Good night, Edward; God bless you." And they separated. After going to his own apart- ment, Mr. Howard could not compose himself suffi- ciently to retire to rest, but sat, as he often did, until midnight, at his books. He, however, was quite uneasy all the time, and his thoughts were constantly reverting to the evening's conversation. As the clock on a neighboring church tolled the hour of twelve, impelled by a feeling for which he could not account, he rose from his seat and went to his brother-in-law's door. It stood ajar, and the light streamed through the opening upon the floor. Tremblingly he entered. Mr. Arlington sat leaning back in his arm-chair, the   36      STEP BY STEP,--OR, open Bible lay on the table beside him; no, not Mr. Arlington now, as Mr. Howard saw upon approach- ing-that which is immortal, his spirit, had gone up ; higher; what remained was lifeless clay.       As Mr. Howard stood gazing upon the peaceful  Di countenance of his departed friend, he heard a slight  rustling sound, and turning, Delia was beside him. g "My father, oh, my father," were the only words A she uttered, as she threw herself upon her knees beside i his inanimate form.                 The Bible before Mr. Arlington was open at the Gi! fifth chapter of second Corinthians. Mr. Howard , taking it up, read, "For we know that if our earthly j house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a : building of God, an house not made with hands,   B eternal in the heavens." Pausing a moment, he then  read again, "For we walk by faith, not by sight." The last sad rites were over, and dust to dust and ashes to ashes, the body of Mr. Arlington rested be- side that of his wife. Mr. Howard and his orphan niece were alone in their sorrow. Delia had borne this great affliction, after the first terrible shock of its suddenness had passed away, with a degree of calm- ness that astonished her uncle. He knew she loved i her father almost to adoration, who, although distant I and reserved in his deportment towards others, lav- shed upon her a tender affection, beautiful to witness. Indeed, as he had once told Mr. Howward, he wished to be at once father and mother to his daughter, "for," said he:  You and I, Edward, know what the poor child has lost in having been deprived from her early infancy of the loss of such a mother as hers."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      37 But Delia's nature was not one to sit down and encourage grief. As, during her father's lifetime, it had been her highest happiness to please and obey him; now that he was no more, she resolved to the extent of her ability to follow his wishes and his example. She knew he would not wish her to spend her days and nights in unavailing sorrow; and, moreover, she felt it was wrong in itself But she found it very difficult to control her feelings, while she was so con- tinually surrounded by objects reminding her of him and his love. A change she saw would be of service to her, however trying it might be to part from her uncle, and leave her dearly loved home. As yet Mr. Howard had said nothing to his niece respecting her father's wishes, wisely judging that as she knew what they were, it would be better to leave her to herself to decide what she would do. One evening in the latter part of September, about three weeks after her father's death, she said to him: "Uncle Edward, you know what my father desired me to do when he had left us." "Yes, dear, I know."  "I should like, uncle, if you please, that you would make the necessary arrangements' for me to go to New York by the middle of October." "So soon, dear?" "Yes, sir, the longer I stay here the harder will it be for me to leave you and my home; and uncle, I would rather die than not do as my father wanted me to." "You are right, Delia, yoWr father wrote a week or two previous to his death to your Aunt Grafton, re- questing her to receive you into her family for a year, if you desired it, after his departure. I will write 4   38      STEP BY STP,--- OR,          to-morrow and inform her of your decision.

But I  M trust you will not be. I know very little of your Aunt Grafton's family; I have been informed that  j they are gay, fashionable people. You are of an age now when it is well that you should see life in some I new aspects."         "But my Aunt Leslie, Uncle Howard. Was she     ike my mother? Why, as she is your sister, do you  ilever visit lier?"  "In some respects she is- like your mother, or what } your mother was, though, perhaps she possesses less I energy of will. As it respects my visiting her,*"-  and here a shade of sorrow passed over his face,-- ; 4' an absurd pride, which you have sense enough to  consider contemptible, kept me long estranged from i her, and now, with my habits and infirmities, I do not feel as if I could malke so long a journey. This city has been my home for many years, and yet" he added as if speaking to himself, "Mary was my darling sister; how we loved each other! We thought  your aunt married beneath her position, because her husband was a mechanic, and indignantly opposed it, as became a proud and aristocratic family like ours. I say we; but not so with your noble-minded mother, she never could view the matter as we did. I have lived, I thank God, to see the folly of my boy- ish pride and prejudice. I was educated with such exalted views of our family standing and importance, that I really thought Mr. Leslie, an honest, independ-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      3P ent and intelligent -mechanic, belonged to another order of beings than that of ourselves, the Howards of Buffalo."  Perceiving that the subject was a painful one to her uncle, Delia forbore to question him farther re- specting her Aunt Leslie, and asked him if he would not visit her in New York. "No, my dear," was his reply, " unless there is some necessity for my doing so. I have lived so many years a quiet secluded life,--books my only friends out of our family circle, - I should be lost in the whirl and confusion of the great city whither you are going." ("Uncle Edward," said Delia, " why have you al- ways lived so quiet a life? Why did you never marry? Then I could have staid with you always?' "Literature is my wedded wife, my dear; why I have no other is too sad a tale to grieve your young heart with. At a future day, when you are older, perhaps I will tell you somewhat of the past, although it will awaken many painful recollections. Mine was a wayward, though not a vicious youth, my child, and it was necessary for me to undergo muce trial and suffering, before the darkness of my mind was dispelled. To your father I owe much, and to his daughter would I repay in part the great debt Come to me freely then with all your sorrows anc griefs, and I will render you all the aid in my power."  "Oh uncle, I shall be so glad to know, that I calr write to you just as freely as I have always talked." Mr. Howard wrote to Judge Grafton, as he prom- ised Delia, and the following week received- an answer couched in somewhat formal and stately terms, to the effect that Mrs. Grafton and himself   40      STEP BY STEP,--OR, would be happy to receive Miss Arlington whenever it should be agreeable to her to come to New York." "Miss Arlington!" said Delia indignantly, " and I am his wife's own niece. I shan't like him, I know."  The arrangements of her departure were speedily  completed, and her uncle having found a safe escort i for her, she left the home in which all the years of her young life she had been the object of such tender in- terest, to take up her abode for the first time among strangers. The parting was a sad one. Outside of her own home, Delia had but few friends. These were among the poor and unfortunate, whom she had always been taught to visit and relieve. An old bedridden woman to whom she had long been in the habit of reading an hour each day, and poor Sam, whom she had especially commended to her uncle's care, were those who would most feel her loss, with the excep- tion of poor old nurse, whose grief was almost un- controllable as the hour of separation drew near. "Good, dear nursey, do not cry so," said Delia as she saw the large drops rolling down the furrows which time and trouble had ploughed in her kind old face. "When- I am of age, I will come back to Buffalo, perhaps to live, and then we will all be to- gether." "Do not think that, my darling. Long before you come back again, God will call me home, and now, that I shall see your dear face no more, how I long to go. Your father was past the prime of life when he laid him down to die, yet I was large and stout as my Ann, when he played ball and rolled hoop as merry a lad as you would wish to see. Why he was taken and I left, He knows who reigns above; His   DELIA ARLINGTON.      41 will be done. No, no, never hope to see old nursey again, and oh, my darling, to think that these old eyes will never look upon your sweet face more. Oh, how can I bear it?" and she gave way again in a burst of almost childish grief. Delia threw her arms around the good old creature's neclk, and tried to soothe her sorrow, even while her: own heart was almost bursting. Apparently she succeeded, for immediately nurse dried her tears, ant raising Delia, so that she could look full into he, clear blue eyes, said: "If you ever come back to Buffalo, you will find only my grave. And now, dear Delia, let me pray you to believe, on the word of an old woman, who has had her share of trouble in this world, that there is but one way to heaven, and that is through Christ; who died for our sins. Do not trust to your own strength, but lean upon him, and though fatherless and motherless, you will not be alone. Yes, I am bound for that happy land," raising her eyes to heaven, " and may we all meet there at last, singing praises to God and the Lamb. Oh! that will be glorious."' She then folded her hands, and laying them gently on Delia's head, pronounced these solemn words. "O Lord, bless and keep this young lamb of thy flock. Lead her into green pastures and beside the still waters, and give her and us strength to beai all our burdens." At this moment Mr. Howard's voice was hearc calling to Delia, that the carriage was waiting: Once more embracing the faithful friend, who had watched over her from earliest infancy, she hastenec away without speaking another word. She took he seat in the carriage by the side of her uncle, and helte 4*   42      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, his hand locked in hers, feeling that the last link that bound her to her early happy home, would be sun- dered when she parted with him. Fortunately this leave-taking was in the presence of strangers, and she was forced to control her deep emotion. Delia knew as little of the world she was about to enter, as she did of the latent passions of her own heart, because the circumstances of her life hitherto had been such as to keep her aloof from the one, and ignorant of the other. From her infancy she had been the constant and caressed companion of father and uncle, who, however much they differed in many of their characteristics, were alike in the nobleness and refinement of their natures, and she had been treated by them with that tender reverence felt by such minds even for children of the gentler sex. As it has been stated, her uncle, with whom perhaps she was more free than with her father, suspected her of possessing natural propensities and dispositions of which, in the atmosphere of her loving home and secluded life, she herself had been quite unconscious.- Although she had been religiously educated, and possessed a great deal of what might be called re- ligious sensibility, she could scarcely be said to be under the control of religious principle, but she was rather self-sustained by the resolution and energy of her own will. In fact, as yet, her character was like the unfilled warp in the loom, each separate thread of which has a capacity for various uses, waiting for the woof to be woven in, that it may become a firm and beautiful fabric, fitted to endure the wear and tear of every-day life. In Delia were kindly feelings and noble impulses, which, however commendable and desirable in themselves, wanted that stability of   DELIA ARLINGTON.       43 purpose and consistency of action, which Christian principle alone could impart to them. The time was now approaching when she herself would be convin- ced of this important truth. Circumstances which were to her, as they are to all, the woof that is woven into the web of life, were now to bring her new ex- periences, and, according as she should determine, to be wrought into her character. 4S k  , .   "       STEP DV STEP,-- OR, CHAPTE R V. "Thie law of the loutse worlks itself ilnto the circulations and fibres of every growing brancli.

F. D. HUNTINGTON. "I vUST say, Mrs. Graftoll, with all due respect to your deceased  brother's memory, that I always thought him one of the most peculiar men I ever knew, and the arrangement he has made for his daughter confirms me in that opinion." "' What now, Mr. Grafton?" inquired the lady ad- adressed. Of course he could make but one arrange- ment with regard to her place of residence; she will live with us. I presumed he intended she should from his letter to me a few weelis since." "You can read Mr. Howard's laconic epistle, and judge for yourself of its contents," replied the stately jurist, throwing the letter into her lap as ungraciously as his ideas of always maintaining a dignified deport- ment would permit. "Absurd! so wanting in respect and confidence in you, not, at least, to have appointed you one of her guardians, and then the idea of letting a mere child of fourteen choose her own place of residence, though, proud little thing that I hear she is, she will not hesi- tate long between a home at Judge Grafton's in the city of New York, and at her Aunt Leslie's in a country town in Massachusetts."   DELIA ARLINGTON.          45 "I do not know about that, Mrs. Grafton; if I am not mistaken, hers is a pride that apes humility, and she is quite as likely to take the whim of living there as here." "4 Well, so much the less trouble for us, my dear. I'm sure we don't need the ' handsome remuneration,' and my own girls are care enough." "'Of course we do not need it, but we do need to be properly appreciated. And then the folly of leav- ing an indulged, spoiled child to decide between choosing a home with us, or with William Leslie, a mere mechanic.   It is perfectly preposterous." -"Shall you consent to receive her on such con. ditions?" "Of course, Mrs. Grafton.   To decline, would be giving too much importance to what, after all, is a very trifling affair. I conclude, if she does not remain with us permanently, the loss will be hers and not ours. I consider it quite beneath my dignity to discuss the matter.  To-morrow  I shall reply in  the affirma- tive to Mr. Howard's letter." So saying, Judge Grafton retired to the library, with his usual slow and stately step, and his wife took up the letter and read it again. Its contents were as follows: "JUDGE GRAFTON. "DEAR SIR: --In accordance with an arrangement made with yourself and Mrs. Grafton, by my deceased brother-in-law, Mr. Arlington, I write at the request of my niece Delia, to ascertain when it will be agreeable to you to receive her into your family. It was her father's wish, though he made no express stipulation to that effect, that she should reside one year with you and one with her mother's sister, Mrs. Leslie, the choice of a homle at the expi- ration of that time being left optional with herself. This latter circumstance, I think, you were not made acquainted with by Mr.   "       STEP BY STEP, --OR, Arlington, in his communication to you. A handsome remunera- tion will, of course, be made for any expense or trouble she may cause yon. 1 will add, that she inherits half her father's large property, and I am her guardian. ' My niece awaits your decision and pleasure with respect to the subject-matter of this communication. "Respectfully, your obedient servant, DWA"EDWARD HOWARD." Mrs. Grafton, after reading the letter, passed it to her eldest daughter, Maria, who was reclining upon a couch reading, and who had not vouchsafed any interest in the matter thus far. She was a tall, showy, fashionable girl, and looked as if, young as she evidently was, she was already a sufferer from that listless ennui, which knows no better remedy than the last new novel. She returned the letter to her mother after glancing at its contents, as carelessly as she had taken it, and said, contemptuously: "Really I hope you and my father properly feel the honor that is about to be conferred upon you. She's a disagreeable girl, I have no doubt. Iwouldn't receive her on such terms." "Your father thinks it best, my dear,'" said Mrs. Grafton, almost apologetically, " and so do I, though, as he says, it is probable she is an indulged, spoiled child." Maria made no reply, as she was already again absorbed in her book, and Mrs. Grafton, who stood almost as much in awe of her proud, imperious daughter, as she did of her stately and haughty hus- band, was quite relieved by her silence. An " indulged " child Delia certainly had been, but not a spoiled child, in the usual acceptation of the term, as is evident from the foregoing chapters. Truth in word and act, and obedience, in spirit as   DELIA ARLINGTON.      47 well as to the letter, had been inculcated and enforced upon her at so early an age, that she never knew the time when she dared or wished to utter a falsehood, or when her father's commands were not imperative upon her. These two great points in her moral discipline early gained, she had a broad margin of liberty.- A s her father had no wish to be constantly repressing her young, ardent spirit, of late- years she had been treated, as it has been shown, by him and her uncle more as a companion than as a child. Had she known how her Uncle Edward's letter in her behalf had been received in New York, she would probably have been confirmed in the opinion so has- tily expressed, when the answer was read, that she should not like Judge Grafton. As it was, she was speeding on her journey, her mind filled with sad re- membrances of the dear home now lost to her forever, -for she was determined, at whatever cost to her feelings, to regard her father's expressed wish as sa- cred as his written command, - giving little thought to the new one she was approaching. So lost was she in her own reflections, that the gentleman and lady under whose protection she trav- elled, after several ineffectual attempts to interest her in the ever changing, ever beautiful scenery of the way across the State and down the Hudson, left her to the companionship of her own musings. It was not until she had arrived at New York that she had a full sense of her solitary condition. There was no one to meet her, as she had expected, and as she looked around over the: crowd gathered together at the steamboat landing, and saw not a single face among them all with which she was familiar, she realized in all its fulness the fact, that she was in a   48      STEP BY STEP,- OR, strange city and among a strange people. Altogether she was so sad and disappointed, that she was hardly able to reply to the kind remarks of her protectors, who told her that they would not leave her until she was safely deposited at Judge Grafton's. The ride seemed interminable through the busy streets of the great metropolis, but at last the carriage stopped at the door of an elegant mansion opposite a park in the upper part of the city. The door was thrown open by an important looking waiter, who, indeed, always went in the servants department by the name of"Judge." Poor Delia had only Seen her Aunt Grafton once some years previous, but had no very definite recollection of her, and she felt it was quite uncertain what her reception would be. Her aunt, however, came forward and gave her a kindly welcome, and led her into the drawing-room where her two cousins were. Maria gave her, as might have been expected, but a cool and indifferent wel- come; but Clara, a young girl about her own age, was much more cordial, and soon took her to her own apartment to rest and prepare for dinner. Left alone, Delia gave way to the emotions so natural to her situation, for she- already realized, that, however kind her relatives might be, there was an en- tirely different atmosphere in this stately abode of luxury, from that which had pervaded her own un- pretending, quiet home. Hers was a heroic nature, however, and she soon dried her tears and busied her- self in preparation for dinner; and when Clara came for her to conduct her to the dining-room, she was composed and even cheerful. On their way down they came to an open door, through which Delia saw a little boy about three   DELIA ARLINGTON.      49 years of age, struggling to get from his nurse. As she stopped to look at him, he came running towards her, crying, "Tozen Dele, I must see my new tozen Dele." She sprang forward and caught him in her arms, kissing him again and again. "La, cousin Delia," said Clara, laughing, " do you like young ones so much?" "I don't know much about them, but I'm sure I shall like this little rogue." "Well, there's the dinner bell, and father will be angry if we are not punctual." "Dood night, tozen Dele," said, the little fellow, as she put him down to follow Clara; "dood night, tome adin to see ittle Herby." "That I will, darling," she answered. "Oh, Clara," she continued, as the two hastened through the hall, "how I wish I had -such a darling brother." "Such a darling plague, you mean, I suppose, for I don't think he is much else." "Oh, you don't mean " Here Delia stopped short, as the dining-room door was thrown open, and the elegantly arranged table sparkling in a' full blaze of gas light, her aunt and cousin richly dressed, and Judge 'Grafton in all his pomp and dignity, flashed at once upon her vision. Judge Grafton- (she felt at once she could never call him uncle) received her with the same lofty and formal manner he would have done, had she been an indifferent stranger of twice her age. That dinner was the commencement of a new era in Delia's life. It opened a new page of experience to her. Unaccustomed as she was to pomp and luxury, she felt that the change now beginning in the manner of her life was almost ,as sudden and won- 5   50      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, derful as any of the transformations related in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. If she was im- pressed with the grandeur of everything about her, she was chilled by the restraint which Judge Grafton's presence seemed to impose upon every member of the family, with the exception, perhaps, of Maria. Clara ate her dinner in silence. Mrs. Grafton only ventured, upon conversation when her husband led the way, and this day he said very little. Towards the con- clusion of the tedious meal, a ring was heard at the hall door, and presently it was opened and shut with some violence, and Delia thought she heard a low whistle and a quick step up stairs. "Is that my cousin Fred?" she said to Clara. "Yes, yes, hush," -was the answer, in a quick, low tone. "Will you never teach your sonl, Madam, to be in season at his meals?" said Judge Grafton, in a tone of offended dignity. "I think Fred said he was going to Brooklyn after school to-day with George Morgan. Perhaps they were delayed," was the deprecatory reply. "The delay is what I complain of, Mrs. Grafton." After this not very pleasant interlude, Delia listened, expecting to hear her cousin's footsteps to the dining- room, and wondering how his father would receive him, but he did not make his appearance until later in the evening, when Judge Grafton had retired to his library, where he usually spent all his evenings passed at home. Upon being introduced to her, he accosted her gruffly, and took her offered hand, as if half ashamed of the act, and then, sitting down by the sofa table beside his mother and opposite Maria, began to pull about the worsteds in the latter's basket.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      51 "Do, Fred, let my worsteds alone, won't you?" she said sharply, looking up from the maroon ground she was filling in round a rich bouquet of flowers. "r Yes, marm, I suppose I can," was the reply, in a tormenting tone. Then turning to Delia, he said: "Where's your embroidery, Cousin Delia? Girls here can't get on without a worsted dog or cat to work or a novel to read," taking up one which lay beside Maria. "W hat's this: ' Sorrow passeth away and Joy cometh, or The Devoted Lover, by Pollie Pensive.' Cracky, what a name!" In Give me my book, I say, Fred, and do go and mind your own affairs," was her second angry retort. "Easily minded, since I've nothing under the heavens to do but to tease you and Clara, or our new cousin here. But," and here his manner and look changed, " perhaps you play and sing, Delia, not thrum and squall and make faces; but really play and sing, you know. You look good-natured, and as you haven't set up your worsted cat yet, or taken out your novel, perhaps you'll give me a tune?" "With pleasure," Delia was going to say, when Maria looked up and said, coldly: "The instrument is out of tune, and must not be opened," adding, in an under -tone, "it's my piano- forte, Master Fred." i"Confound you and your piano-forte too," he an- swered, his hitherto careless, mischievous tone and manner changed into one of angry defiance. 4"You're a sister worth having, to be sure. Cracky, if there isn't the governor just shut the hall door," and he started to leave the room, when his mother looked up and said:   52      STEP BY STEP,- OR, I Don't go down stairs, Fred." "No ma'am, of course not," adding, as he closed the dining-room door, " cause why, I don't want to. Tom's out, - so. I'll have a chat with ' Judge, in the butler's pantry."- "Mother," said Clara, as the door closed, "Elenor Thompson has got the sweetest mantilla, and I want one just like it. You know you said I might have a new one this fall." "You must have good taste if you want to wear anything like that little over-dressed thing," said Maria. "It's a beauty, if it is hers, and her Aunt Lee has sent her a love of a hat, too, from Philadelphia, with such sweet rosebuds in the face trimming. By the way, Delia, I saw the prettiest mourning hat to-day, just the thing for you. I suppose, of course, you're going to get a complete outfit." "No, I think I shall only need a few more articles of dress." "I hope you have a handsome allowance, Delia," said her aunt. "Judge Grafton makes it a point that all his family shall make a good appearance." (' Yes, ma'am, I have a large allowance, I believe, but," and here she hesitated a moment, and then proceeded, "I hope, aunt, you will not want me to dress a great deal; my father never liked for me to be extravagant, and I've always been accustomed to save a part of my money for objects of benevo- lence." "A very necessary piece of economy, truly, on your part," said Maria, in a supercilious manner, "when you are to be so rich," and in a lower tone she con- tinued, " to my notion such wonderful prudence savors of parsimony."   DELIA ARLINGTON.       53 Delia heard the last remark, but answered to the first: "4 My father's wishes are sacred to me in matters of dress and benevolence, as in everything else." "Oh, of course," replied Maria, -taking up her book as if she was entirely indifferent to the subject. "You're so full of Delia's dress, mother, you haven't told me yet if I might have a mantilla like Elenor Thorrmpson's. May I? "I'll see about it, Clara, it's late to get a fall man- tilla, and I have my own winter hat and cloak to purchase. I'm sure, Maria, I don't know what to do with my claret velvet; it sets like a fright. That stupid Donnett spoiled it, and I don't believe I can pattern the shade. Oh dear, its so vexatious. And, Maria, do you know, I've actually to set about find- ing a new cook? Sarah has put nutmeg twice into the oyster soup, and your father says she must go. He can't put up with such carelessness, when it is well known he never eats nutmeg with oysters." "Well," said Maria, "I don't blame father; when I keep house, I'll have my servants under iron rule, the careless, impudent things." "Besides, mother,:" broke in Clara, "you say Sarah drinks half the wine and brandy in the house, and I should think you would be glad to get rid of her." "Half the cooks in New York do that," said Mrs. Grafton, " and we must wink at something with the creatures. But Mrs. Rollins, my new housekeeper, comes to-morrow, then I shan't be so troubled with these plagues of servants. My dear," turning to Delia, "I wonder if you are so much troubled in Buffalo with servants as we are here." 5*   54      STEP BY STEP,---- OR, "I don't know, ma'am; my father never had any trouble. Our servants were all attached to us, and lived many years in the family, and you know Nurse Hanson is like one of us." "Oh yes, I know, but she must be very old fashion- ed in her notions by this time." "u Not too much so for us, ma'am. I'm, afraid I know very little about fashion." "Well, you might as well be out of the world, Delia, as out of fashion in New York," said Clara, pertly. "However, we shall have you at home in these matters soon. Dear me, it's ten o'clock. Come let's go to bed."           ' "To this proposition Delia gladly assented, for she was weary in body and mind. She did not wonder there was no summons to family prayers, for she did not expect there would be, after the few hours ex- perience she had already had of " the law of the house." She was glad to be alone in the solitude of her own room. Her cheeks were flushed, and her heart beat quick and fast, and her head ached. "Was this the life she was to live for a whole year?" she asked herself. "Was this a specimen of the conversation she would be obliged to listen to? Was there to be a perpetual antagonism between her haughty cousin Maria and herself? Was there to be a constant call upon her for that moral courage, which it is so hard even for the most independent young mind to exhibit? Above all, could her father have known anything about his sister's family; if he did, how could he have expected her to improve by a residence there?" All these and a great many other questions of like character, the ardent, affectionate young girl asked   DELIA ARLINGTON.      55 herself as she pondered the new life, so strangely opening before her, and it was long before she could compose herself to retire. Her nightly devotions somewhat soothed her troubled mind, and, laying her head upon her pillow, she soon sank into a heavy slumber, from which she did not awake until she was aroused early in the morning by the noise and confusion of the city.   56        STEP BY STEP,---OR, CHAPTER VI. "What are their showy treasures . What are their noisy pleasures? ' The gay, gaudy glare of vanity and art The polish'd jewels blaze May draw the wondering gaze, But never, never can come near the worthy heart."' BURNS. ,' Naught shall prevail against us or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all-which we behold Is full of blessings." WORDSWORTH. DELIA soon- found, and not very much to -her regret, that her first evening in the city was the exception, and not the rule; to the general practice of her aunt's family. It was a rare circumstance for Mrs. Grafton and Maria to be at home of an evening, unless they had company. As far as she could judge they passed the greater part of the time in settling and arranging the important matters of dress, shopping, paying morn- ing visits, or receiving them  at home, attending  par- ties, the theatre, opera, private musical soirees, while any half hour left unoccupied in this way, was spent by Maria in novel reading, or worsted work, and by Mrs. Grafton in hasty and fretful inquiries into house- hold matters, in giving orders and counter orders re- specting dinner parties, evening entertainments, &c., with an occasional'visit to the nursery, where little Herbert spent the greater portion  of the time   when not out with his nurse Mary. Thus the younger members of the family were left, evenings particularly, to their own resources for ,    *   DELIA ARLINGTON.      57 amusement. To Delia this was not at all wearisome, after she commenced going to school; which she did her second week in New York, having lessons to learn, and those over, always being able to find a book or some light work to interest her. But with Clara it was different. Having no fondness for general reading, and no taste for work of any description, she usually passed the short interval between lessons and bedtime, which with her was at an early hour, in wishing she was .grown up, and had come out, and could do as mother and Maria did, or in unmeaning tattle about a love of a dress, or hat or shawl, some one or another had. As for Fred, he was seldom seen in the dining room where the two girls generally sat at their les. sons. When he did favor them with his company, he often made himself quite disagreeable to Delia by his rude manners and slang phrases. Sometimes he asked her to play and sing, but so distasteful was his society to her, that, in complying, she made very little effort to induce him-to renew the request. She had been so accustomed to the intelligent and refined conversation of her father and- uncle, she could not find anything attractive, or even pleasant in this neg- lected, yet spoiled boy. Nevertheless, Fred had naturally a kind heart, and warm affections, and had she been less fastidious in her taste, she might have found a good deal of pleasure in his society, and been the means, perhaps, of winning him to a better course of life than he was then inclining to pursue. But as yet, she had scarce- ly taken the first step in Christian discipline; she had not attained to the grace of self-forgetfulness. At home no duty had been repugnant, to her, for every   58      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, duty for those she loved was a pleasure. If she re- volved the matter at all in her own mind, she probably came to- the conclusion, that her cousin was so disagreeable, it was useless to try to be interested in him. Many older and more- experienced persons than Delia, not only excuse themselves from positive duties on such grounds, but even make a merit of their fault by pleading their own exquisite fastidiousness of taste, and. the impracticability of bringing their re- fined and delicate feelings into such repulsive associ- ations. But they forget the example of him of Judea, -who was the friend of publicans and sinners, or fail to discover what duties that example imposes -on them.              - Delia saw very little of Judge Grafton, except at meals, and then he seldom addressed her, unless it was in a formal manner in the necessary civilities of the table. She had not been long under his roof, however, before she found that he was disposed to exercise authority over her in matters of too trivial consequence, as she judged, for so stately and digni- fied a person to concern himself about. The first day of her attending school, Clara pro- posed, as they were returning home, to walk up Broadway, instead of taking the more retired and usual street in which they went in the morning. Delia, not unwilling to see more of the great thorough- fare of the throbbing and crowding life of the nation's metropolis, readily assented, but not without assuring herself of its propriety by saying: "If your mother will not object?" ("Oh no, she does'nt care how we go home, if we're only there in time to dress for dinner."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      59 Upon their arrival at the door, Clara said: "Don't say anything about our being in Broadway to-day before fathers- that's a good girl; he don't quite like to have us there, unless we are dressed." 4' Why did you not tell me so, when I asked you about it?" said Delia, indignantly. 1"You asked me if mother would object, and I told you no, and I don't think she would, if it wasn't for father's being so fussy." "I will not say anything about it, if I can help it, this time; but I warn you, Clara, never to make me a party to any deception again. I shall never con- sent to it. If I do anything contrary to the wishes of any one, I am willing that it should be known." "All very fine, but let's see if you don't change your tune before you have been here many months." "I don't see why I should. I never feared to tell my own father anything I had done wrong. If you are so afraid of your father, why do you do what you know he will not like?" - When you've lived here long enough to find out how many things father prohibits to us, and how terribly angry he is if he finds out we disobey him, you will never need to ask such questions." Delia soon had an opportunity of knowing how "( terribly angry," Judge Grafton could be. Fred, who was often, enough in disgrace himself with his pompous and rigid father, took a mischievous delight in bringing down his displeasure upon others. In what he was about to say at the present time he had another motive. Delia was an anomaly to him. He neither understood her, nor was he capable of understanding her, but he knew very- well that his mother and sisters, even the haughty Maria, quailed   60      STEP BY STEP,--OR, before his father's displeasure, and he was curious to witness its effects on his cousin. Accordingly watch- ing his opportunity, when a pause occurred in the conversation at the dinner table, so that all might hear him, he said: "( Cousin Delia, how did you enjoy your walk in Br6adway to-day?" Delia looked up greatly surprised, and, glancing first at Fred, and then at Clara, simply replied, "Very well." "Short and sweet is your answer, cousin mine, but you appeared to be very much absorbed in something when I met you. Indeed, Grand Street is a long way from your school route." Judge Grafton looked at her with that peculiar air of astonished dignity, which he knew so well how to assume, and inquired in deliberate and measured language: "' Do I understand, Miss Arlington, that you actually walked in Broadway to-day on your return from school?"  "I did, sir. But I did not know at the time that there was any objection to it. In future, I trust, I shall be able to confine my walks in going to and from school to such streets as it shall be your pleas- ure to have me take. This she said with a coolness well nigh amounting to contempt. "I confess I am astonished, that a young lady, accustomed to society, should not of herself see the impropriety of walking Broadway at the most fash- ionable hour of promenade in her school dress. No member of my family is allowed to do it." "Had Clara no generosity?" thought Delia.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      61 "Could Judge Grafton suppose, that she, a stranger in the city, was walking there alone?" "Cousin Delia is accustomed to be quite independ- ent in her actions, it would seem, and finds it quite hard to confine herself within the bounds of strict pro- priety," broke in Maria's measured tones upon her indignant thoughts. "Some persons like notoriety." Luckily for Delia's self-command, her aunt ad- dressed her at that moment, and equally fortunate for Clara, the waiter entered with a note for the judge, which required an immediate answer. "How cross in you Fred," said Clara to him after dinner, "to let father know about our being in Broad- way to-day." "I said nothing about you, Miss, and you did'nt have any lecture. I wanted to see how our tragedy queen would look and act. By George, what a spirit she has got. I should'nt want to be her hum- ble servant." "I should have had a lecture, though, if father hadn't wanted to make an impression upon Delia, and if that lucky note hadn't come just as it did; no thanks to you, sir, that I didn't." "Well, you girls might as well take some share off' the lecturing.' I have enough of it. Confound me, if I don't think the governor grows harder to suit every day."' So saying, the dutiful son and affectionate brother took his hat and sauntered off, in quest of what was not provided for him at home. Delia wrote every week to her Uncle Edward, and in her letters she very freely expressed her feelings and opinions with regard to the new life -she had entered. upon, while she did not hesitate to confess to him her 6   62      STEP BY .STEP, -- OR, own weaknesses and imperfections, and likewise her astonishment at the insight which passing events were giving her into her own heart; how there were passions and emotions there almost every day awak- ened, of whose existence she had heretofore been unaware. In one of her letters, she wrote: "Sometimes I feel almost a contempt for all the family; they seem to lead such frivolous lives, and attach so much impor- tance to what seems to me very trivial matters. Then Fred annoys me terribly, and Clara teases me. But the worst of all is, I feel so unkindly towards Maria. I often find rising up in my heart a spirit as haughty, and sometimes as ill-natured as her own. Have I really such a bad heart, and am I, after all, no more amiable than she is?"' After relating to her uncle Clara's deceit and Judge Grafton's rebuke for walking in Broadway, she con- tinued: "Must I conform to his rules in such trifling. matters? Is it my duty to, because I am a member of his family? C"Then another thing: it troubles me to see so many poor people here in the streets, whom I am not allowed to relieve, because they are impostors, Aunt Grafton says. "If they are impostors, all these miserable people, I should think something might be done to make them better. We saw so many of them, men and women and children, that it took away all my pleas- ure, and I could not help thinking about Lazarus and the rich man. Is it right for me to be heiress to great riches, when there are so many who have neither bread to eat nor clothes to wear? I can't make it all out, and it troubles me." ..    DELIA ARLINGTON.       63 a Poor child," said her uncle to himself, as he read- this passage in his niece's letter, "it is a problem which older and wiser heads than yours have failed to solve. Ages upon ages has the world been grow- ing up to its present structure of mingled beauty and deformity, under the controlling will of Infinite Wis- dom. To the doubting heart, I would say, ' He doeth all things well;' not as our ways are His ways, and He seeth not as man seeth. In those days of unbelief, when there was no light firom heaven to illumine for me the dark places of the earth, -how in the pride of my own wisdom, which was foolishness, I exultingly brought forward this very state of the world, this very inequality in the position and circum- stances of the different classes of society, as a proof that there was no God, no tender and loving Father in heaven. But I have learned the lesson of faith. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and I know also that man doth not live by bread alone." Delia's letter gave Mr. Howard great pain. "It is bad enough," thought he, " for a solitary man like myself to be so quick to see, and so ready to condemn the follies and weaknesses of others, but for a child,- a woman that is to be, -in whom all kindly feelings should have full growth and expansion, and whose influence- and empire should consist in love,--for her to be so keen-sighted is a misfortune indeed." To her letter he made a prompt and lengthy reply, in which he sought to give her a right understanding of her duties as a member of Judge Grafton's family, and to relieve her anxieties with regard to her wealth. In reference to her aunt and cousins, he wrote as follows: "' Never judge of a person's heart from the outward   "      STEP BY STEP,---OR manner, at least until repeated acts'have convinced you that the inward motive and the outward mani- festation correspond the one to the other, as cause and effect. 4 I do not expect that you will find much sympathy in your aunt's family, nor do I wish that you should, if the members of it are such as you represent them, because their mode of life is entirely at variance with your father's standard of a true life. But in all you . can find some good points, some common ground upon which to meet, so that your residence there may be at least a peaceful one. "In answer to your serious question, I will give you as serious a reply. While you live under Judge Grafton's roof, it is your positive duty to conform to his and your aunt's wishes, so far as you can without violating principle. Trifling concessions and a cheer- ful yielding on your part, in unimportant matters, will do you good and gratify them, and thus possibly enable you to gain an influence, which you could not do by setting yourself in opposition to them. To one, whose whole life has thus far been passed in an atmosphere of truth, and who herself treasures that priceless jewel of the character as it deserves to be, I need not say never sacrifice that to anything else. You remember your father's favorite quotation, which he so often repeated to you, even before you could fully understand its meaning: 'This above all, to thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou can'st not be false to any man.' Young as you are, you are old enough to know that even truth may be made loveable or distasteful, ac-   DELIA ARLINGTON.       65 cording as you clothe it in garments of beauty or give it a harsh and repulsive form." In answer to the question respecting her right to so much property, while so many were in want, he wrote : "Do not attach an undue importance to-your wealth, either as it respects yourself or others. It may be made in your hands the -means of vast good. By it you may be able to bind up many bleeding hearts, and ease many a fellow creature of the heavy burdens which are pressing them down. But in itself it has no power to do good., It cannot regenerate the world, although it may serve to help on the divine work of human redemption. Strive to educate your heart and conscience by the teachings of the New Testament, and then, when you are old enough to be trusted with your property, you will find it a gift of God, in involving great responsibilities to be sure, with which you may effectually serve and benefit others. Remember always, that you are but the steward of the goods you possess. "Does my dear little niece think that T am rigid and unreasonable in my requirements, and that I place before her heights of excellence unattainable to any efforts she can make, and which I have never reached myself? I answer, that I earnestly desire for her, what, in my own youth, I failed to obtain. Other reproof for naughty words or deeds of the child -of my love, have I none than this: ' Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things.' ("Now, my dear little niece, have I answered your letter as you wished? I shall be very sorry, if by my candor I have prevented you from writing freely to me in future. You are the dearest object of interest I have on this earth. Of what might have been, - of 6*   "     STEP BY STEP,---OR, the home I might have had to offer my elder sister's only child, I will not now speak-; but when you are older, I will tell you a tale which will convince you, if you have ever doubted it, that from past experience and life-long retribution, I have a right, in all sin- cerity, to warn you of dangers, which, from my intimate knowledge of your character, I fear may beset you."   DEIIA ARLINGTON.        67 CHAPTER VII. "Acquaint thee with thyself, O man! so shalt thou be humble: The hard, hot desert of thy heart shall blossom with the lily and the rose; The frozen cliffs of pride shall melt as an iceberg in the tropics; The little fountain of self-seeking be sweeter than the waters of the Nile." "Rashy, not oft-times truly, doth man pass judgment on his brother; For he seeth not the springs of the heart, nor heareth the reason of the mind." "DEAR, kind Uncle Edward," thought Delia, after carefully reading and re-reading his letter to her, " if he were only with nle, how much easier would it be to be good than it is now. But I dare say it is all for the best, and I'm so glad that, at any rate, I have the safety valve of writing to him. No fear that I shall not do so freely enough. Ah, now I begin to know what he meant, when he used to talk to me about the undeveloped sharp corners of my character; sharp enough some of them   are to be sure.  Oh, dear, I never thought at home I could have such passions. I know it is very wrong for me to feel as I do toward my aunt's family, for, except Maria, they are all kind to me in their way, though it's not like the kindness I've been used to. Yes, yes, I will try to be a better girl, now that I know at least some of my faults.  I am proud and passionate and impatient of control, and I must subdue these bad feelings first of all." Delia was in earnest in the resolution of amend- ment she made, although, with the sanguine temper- ament of youth, she knew little of the magnitude of   68      STEP BY STEP,--OR, the task before her. She was, however, becoming mope cheerful than she was at first, and she certainly enjoyed, perhaps, the purest unalloyed happiness granted to her sex, the fond, reciprocated love of ani innocent child; for little Herbert watched for her coming, and welcomed her presence in his nursery with a degree of eager expectation that was balm to her still sad but kind heart. Ever since he had so resolutely insisted upon making the acquaintance of tozen Dele, on the first night of her arrival, she had been installed in a high place in his affections, and she found his nursery, as she wrote to her uncle, a haven of refuge from the vexation and trials which she encountered elsewhere. "Please, Miss Delia, will you come down and see if you can do anything with this naughty boy; his mamma is out, and Miss Maria never will come near him when he isn't good?" asked Mary, his nurse, one morning in a pleading voice of Delia, as the latter sat in her own room absorbed in a book. "4 Oh, yes, I'll come; but what's the matter?'i' "Oh, he wants to have on a frock his mother left word he wasn't to wear, and you never saw such a mad fit as he's in about it. It beats me to know what to do with him." Sure enough, he was in a mad fit. With stream- ing eyes and flushed cheeks the little' rebel was stamping up and down the floor with all his might, crying out between his sobs in a passionate voice, "Herby will wear dat fock --Herby will, Herby says." For a moment Delia stood irresolute. Unaccus- tomed to children, she knew not, at first, how to say, "peace, be still," to the angry waves of passion,   DELIA ARLINGTON.      69 which, for the time, swept over his infant heart. But her real love for the child, added to her firmness of purpose, intuitively guided, her aright. She went up to him, and in a gentle voice said, "Why, what's the matter with little Herby? will he tell cousin Delia?" at the same time drawing him towards her, and trying to take him on her lap. At first he resisted, pulled himself away, pouted, and then repeated, "Herby will." But when in a gentle voice she said, "Cousin Delia is very sorry," he looked up and meeting the gaze of sorrowful love bent upon him, laid his head in her lap and sobbed violently. She raised him in her arms, and when he was a little quiet, said: , Herby will do as mamma wishes, will he not?" "Herby want to wear dat pretty fock; not dat old one," was the reply. Mary explained that the prohibited frock was a fa- vorite one with him, being blue, while the other was a brown plaid, which he disliked; and that his mother wished to have some alteration made in the one he so furiously insisted upon wearing. "Why did you rot tell him so, Mary? He is old enough to understand about it; then you could have coaxed him, could you not?" "La, Miss, I didn't have time; he went off in his tantrums as soon as he saw this frock. I'm sure, I'm fond of him enough; but I don't know what to do with him, that's a fact. If he cries when his honor the Judge is at home, it's ' Mary, can't you keep that child quiet?' and if he gets into mischief and soils his clothes, it's ' Mary, can't you keep that child clean?' and then there's nobody to make him mind but me, for his mother will let him do anything, and then she don't like it if he's naughty, as if it was my fault.   '70      STEP BY STEP,--OR, Oh, dear," said she, in conclusion of this list of griev- ances, "I'd never live here if I didn't get such good wages, and it wasn't for the old father at home." "Are you Irish?" asked Delia, for her manner of speaking was so entirely American, that until this allusion to her old father it- had never occurred to her that she was another country woman. "Yes indeed, Miss, that am I; but look at little Master now; I'm sure he's ready to be dressed at last." Some slight symptoms of rebellion, however, ap- peared in the little fellow, as soon as he found himself the object of attention again; but when Delia ex- plained to him his mother's reasons for wishing him to wear the frock, and told him if he loved his mamma he would try to please her, and be a good boy, he answered, "Herby love tozen Dele and Mary too; Herby be dressed now." "Why don't you try to coax -him; Mary, and give him the reasons for making any change he's not ac- customed to; though to be sure," remembering her own training in this particular, " he ought to mind without a reason being given to him every time." "That's my notion, Miss; that's the way we had to do at home, but it takes more authority than I have to make him mind always; and as to reasons, I don't think, Miss, there is a reason for everything that's done in this house." "Well," said Delia, not caring to discuss the ways of the house with a servant, " he's fond of you, Mary, and I dare say he'll not give you so much trouble again very soon. I'll come any time to help you when I can. I never had a little brother or sister." Something sad in the tone of Delia's voice arrested   DELIA ARLINGTON.       71 the attention of both nurse and child, for Mary looked compassionately at her, and Herbert, as if conscious of a call upon his sympathies, said, "Herby love tozen Dele."  She embraced him fondly, and said: "I love you, too, darling. Now I must go to my room. Kiss Cousin Delia, and try to be a good boy all day." "Oh," said the little fellow, clasping his fat arms tightly round her neck, "Herby love Dele, Herby do. More than Ria or Clary." "Hush, darling, you can love us all with that big heart of yours, I think." "I am very ungrateful," she thought as she returned to her own apartment, " to murmur and repine, as I have done, when I have this dear little fellow to love me so much, and so many, many blessings beside." One great source of happiness to Delia was her school life, which she now enjoyed very much, as she engaged with great earnestness in her studies. Her teacher, Mrs. Dennett, was a highly cultivated and re- fined lady, and interested herself in the moral as well as the intellectual improvement pf her pupils. She had been, from the first, very much pleased with Delia, both on account of her attainments, which were greater than those of most girls of her age, and of her respectful, yet frank manners. She saw, however, with some pain, that Delia kept aloof from her school-mates, apparently caring little for their society. One day at recess, Mrs. Dennett came from her private room, and finding Delia at her desk, said to her, kindly: It is not well for you, my dear, to sit at your books so diligently. I should like to see you min- gling more with your school-mates."   72      STEP BY STEP,--OR, Delia blushed, and said she had never been much accustomed to the society of those of her own age, and therefore did not feel the want of it. Clara, who happened to be near, at the moment, and heard Mrs. Dennett's remarks) said to her on her way home with some triumph in her voice: "I knew just how it would be. Mrs. Dennett is very democratic in her notions, and I was sure she wouldn't approve of your being so exclusive." "Exclusive! Clara, it is not that, I am sure. I hope she don't think it." "Well, all the girls think so; and they think the reason you are so proud and exclusive, is, because you are rich and such a good scholar." "Oh, Clara!" "They do, and I told them you were just the same at home, and you know you are. But now tell me, Delia, whom do you like best of all the girls?" "I am sorry, Clara," replied Delia, in a tone which evinced sonie irritation, and without noticing her question, " that the girls should have such an opinion of me, and that you should confirm it. You know I am not proud of my wealth, as indeed, having only a limited allowance, I never think much about it. I am not used to being with girls of my own age. Why could you not have told them so? -It would be kinder than to agree with them." "La, Delia, most girls like to be thought proud; you're such a queer piece, I don't know what to make of you. But you haven't answered my question." "Which of the girls do I like best? I don't know any of them well enough to tell hardly, but I think Miss Temple is a very lovely girl; she's so gentle and refined, and so modest."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      73 "Helen Temple! That's a good one, to be sure; why, we call her, out of Mrs. Dennett's hearing, the charily scholar. Her mother does fine embroidery for a living, and can't afford to pay for her daughter's tuition." "I don't know anything about that," replied Delia, "but it does not seem very kind in you to call her a charity scholar; she's a very interesting girl to me, at least; I wish I knew her more." "Well, whom do you like next best, Delia?" "I don't know, I never thought, - but yes, I do like Miss Lawton for some things; she's so natural and honest. A great many of the girls seem to me to be very artificial, Clara." "Adie Lawton and Helen Temple! the richest and the poorest girl in school your favorites; Maria would say it was of a piece with your other eccentricities. Well, I don't agree with you. I never think much about liking or disliking Helen Temple, because my father wouldn't hear of mjy associating with her; but I don't like Adie Lawton one bit, she's always saying such disagreeable things. There's Amelia Danforth and Elenor Thompson, how do you like them?" "There are many other girls whose appearance 1 like better than theirs, Clara; but I don't care to talk about them, at least, till I become better acquainted with them."  Fortunately they were now at their own door, so Clara had no opportunity to pursue the subject, which was an unpleasant one to Delia, not only on account of the recent admonitions from her Uncle Edward with regard to judging others, but also on account of its being contrary to the habits in which she had been educated by her father. It had been one of Mr. Ar-   74      STEP BY STEP,---OR, lington's rules never to discuss the character or judge the motives of others, or allow it to be done in his family, unless there appeared to be some urgent ne- cessity for it, considering such a practice not only profitless, but of absolutely mischievous tendency. - It is probable that Delia had never, in her whole life, heard so many hasty judgments or crude opinions upon all sorts of subjects, as since she had been in her aunt's family, where dress and fashion, and people and servants, were the principal topics of con- versation.   DELIA ARLINGTON.        75 CHAPTER      VJI1. "They know not of the scanty meal, With small, pale faces round; No fire upon the cold damp hearth When snow is on the ground." Miss LANDON. "Oh, I see thee cold and formal, fitted to thy petty part With a little hoard of maxims, preaching down a daughter's heart." TENNYSON. IN the constantly increasing interest which Delia felt in her school and studies, time passed swiftly away with her, and she daily thought less and less of her home annoyances, to which indeed she had become in a degree accustomed. After that unjust reprimand from Judge Grafton, on account of the unfortunate walk in Broadway, nothing had occurred for several- weeks which particularly disturbed or vexed her, and she was beginning to congratulate herself that she had been so successful in fulfilling the sacred precept en- joined upon her by her uncle. She did not reflect, however, as it was scarcely to be expected that she should, that it was comparatively an easy thing to bear in silence and patience such minor trials as were almost inseparable from her new mode of life. Con- sidering, that, while she was a member of Judge Grafton's family, it was her duty to comply with all its requirements so long as they did not oblige her to do anything wrong, she very willingly conformed to the formalities of the table, the general household regulations, and certain rules respecting her deport- ment in the street. No particular restrictions had yet   70      STEP BY STEP,-- OR,          . been laid upon her that came much into collision with any peculiar characteristics or inclinations she might possess, or which aroused within her any strong feelings of antagonism to what she conceived to be unjust or oppressive. But as every day brought with-- it some new experience, of course circumstances were liable to occur which would do this at any time. Returning alone one day from school, she was ac- costed by a child, whose face bore marks of suffering and want, and also that indescribable expression of anxious thought belonging to the old rather than the young, so often caused by the premature develop- ment of character under the forcing process of adver- sity. She was smaller than herself, and thinly clad in a summer frock and light shawl, which she drew close around her, as she stood shivering in the chilling air of autumn. Her story was a simple and direct one, and Delia felt that it was true, although she knew it was very much like the stereotyped tales of distress so often told in large cities, where the vicious poor strive to obtain by fraud what they will not labor  for. Something in Delia's face probably attracted her, as, in passing hastily along after a sharp rebuke from a lady, to whom she had spoken, she met the compassionate glance of her dark blue eye. '"Oh, Miss, you look kind; will you not help me? Indeed, indeed, I am not an idle little beggar, as the lady just called me. To-day is the first time I ever went into the street to beg, and, I think it will be the last, for nobody believes me; and ithis all true that I said to the lady." "I did not hear what you said; tell me," answered Delia, kindly. "I will, Miss, but, oh, they are starving at home,   DELIA ARLINGTON.       " and it is full three hours since I came out, and I have got nothing but a penny a newsboy gave me. My mother has been dead three weeks; my father is sick on his bed, lamed by a fall he got two months ago, and my grandmother .lives with us, but she is too old to do anything except look after the little ones when I am out. There are three of us, a brother and sis- ter, besides me, and there is no one to do anything for them but me, and I --people won't believe I can work, I'm so little, so they won't give me anything to do."' "Have you always lived in the city?" "Oh, no, Miss, or we should know better who to go to for help. We used to live in Y-- till about a year ago; my father thought he could make more money at his trade if he came here, but mother was weakly and the change hurt her, and she took sick and died of consumption, as I was telling you at first." "How did your father get hurt?" "He is a bricklayer, Miss, and he fell from a scaf- folding when he was' at work, with a great quantity of bricks, and was brought home so bruised and sick you'd hardly have known him. The men he worked with helped him all they could, and the gentleman he was working for gave something. If our neighbors, and they are all poor people, Miss, hadn't been good to us, I don't know how we could have lived. Father says, if he was an Odd Fellow, or belonged to some secret society, he'd be looked after. Oh, I wish he was anything that wan't wicked, if he could only be taken care of till he gets well again. But I must go home.  Please, Miss, give me a few pennies, won't you, so I may take home a loaf of breaL?  T shan't 7* !   78      STEP BY STEP,---OR, beg any more to-day. Grandmarm says, God will take care of us, but I'm afraid He's forgotten us, though she says He never does forget, and will not try us more than we can bear." "Your grandmother is right," said Delia, "God never forgets, and He will take care of you. You must believe that, whatever happens. Come with me round the corner to the bake-shop, and I will give you as much bread as you can carry home. I have a shilling in my pocket. Tell me where you live, and I will come to see you this very afternoon, if I can." The child looked up with a grateful smile on her wan young face, and told Delia the street and num- ber without hesitation, and each rapidly took her way home. As soon as Delia got into the house she went in pursuit of her aunt to ask permission to go to the poor family that afternoon, and for one of the servants to show her the way; but unfortunately, as she felt, her aunt was out. It was a great disappointment to her in her state of feeling. One of the servants observing that something was troubling her, informed her that Judge Grafton was in his library. Delia hesitated about asking such a favor of him, but she. knew if she waited for her aunt's return, it would be too late to go before din- ner, and, of course, to go at all that day; so she con- quered her pride and timidly knocked at the library door. Upon hearing the cold " come in," she opened it, and entering, modestly stated her errand and prof- fered her request. Immediately she saw that the evident displeasure with which Judge Grafton re- garded her entrance, was increased rather than dimin- ished upon her making known the object of her visit,   DELIA ARLINGTON.      79 and she hastened to apologize as well as she could by stating the urgency of the case. "It is not that, Miss Arlington, although I am unaccustomed to such intrusions, but I should have supposed, from your knowledge of the customs of my household, you would have understood that such a request could not be granted." "Is there any objection to my going, sir? I thought perhaps James would be willing to show me the way." "My servants have other occupations than that of escorting young ladies on Quixotic adventures, in pursuit of people who probably never existed." "Oh, Judge Grafton, you would not doubt that child's truthfulness if you could see her," and she went on, her feelings much excited, to give her rea- sons for believing the statements of the poor beggar girl. To a person of Judge Grafton's temperament and habits, who never even in anger allowed himself to be excited in manner, however severe a frown his coun- tenance might wear, or however cutting his words might be, nothing was more provoking than enthu- siasm, whatever might be its cause or object. He considered it either as something extremely childish, or as the mark of radicalism and vulgarity. "When you have lived a little longer in a city like New York, Miss Arlington," he replied, in a tone so freezing, that fearless as Delia was, she shrank from him, " you will learn that people in certain positions in society do not go themselves, or allow any mem- bers of their families to go, to such haunts of the low and degraded'as you wish to visit." Delia's spirit was up,- no couchant lion now, but   80      STEP- BY STEPP-- OR, roused and ready for a spring. With forced calm- ness. however, she repeated the name and number of the street, and then asked, with something of defiance in the tone of her voice and manner: ' Is that a disreputable street, sir?" "I do not say that it is, but it is the abode of pov- erty, and unfortunately poverty and vice generally go hand in hand. But my time is precious; I positively forbid your going to the place. As you are under my charge temporarily at least, I consider myself justified 'in being thus decided in the prohibition which your pertinacity requires." Delia did not trust herself to make any reply. In- dignation and anger, not unmingled with contempt, were raging so violently within her swelling bosom, that she knew if she said anything it would be some- thing disrespectful. She gained her own room with the utmost haste, and locking the door walked back and forth in a violent passion. As she recalled the scene with the Judge, and dwelt upon what she con- sidered his hard-heartedness and injustice, to her dis- torted vision the cold and proud man of the world appeared a very monster of cruelty.. She was too angry to cry, but her cheeks were crimson with ex- citement, and her eye flashed with rage. At this crisis, Mary knocked gently at her door, and little Herbert's sweet childish voice was heard asking for admission. "If you please, Miss Delia" said Mary, "may Herby stay with you while I run out of an errand? Mrs. Grafton told me to go out and get her some trimmings to-day, and Ann would stay with Herbert, but she's too busy. But, bless me, you look sick; it's no matter, it will do another time." -   DELIA ARLINGTON.      81 "No, Mary, I'm not sick, and I would like to have Herbert with me; but oh, perhaps you can help me." Delia then related to Mary the circumstance of the morning's meeting with the child, and, in a few words, stated the application she had made to Judge Graf- ton, and its results. "Bless you, why didn't you come to me at once, Miss? I could have told you that it was no use going to the Judge; and, indeed, it wouldn't be safe for you to go round hunting up all the beggars you meet in the street; you might get some sickness or other. Your aunt wouldn't have consented to it any more-than his honor." "Will you go yourself, Mary?" Mary shook her head. "Indeed, Miss, it would be as much as my place is  worth. And you would not want me to go where there was danger of bringing back any sickness to Herby?" "No, surely, but," said Delia, bitterly, 4 at Buffalo we could visit the poor and sick, without any fear of harming ourselves or others; and my father always allowed me to go about with a servant to protect me.' "Yes, Miss, but may-be Buffalo is a bit smaller place than this, which, I've heard say is the largest and next to the, wickedest place in America; that makes a difference. My cousin lives not many blocks away from here, and she's a stout boy of her own who would do anything for me any day; if you don't mind having Herby a while longer, Miss, rll run and see her, and she'll send Barney down to the place to see who they are, and how they live there jest. Bar- ney's a shrewd boy and a good one too, Miss, and   82      STEP BY STEP,-OR, never you fear." Seeing that Delia hesitated, "You may depend upon what he says. If he brings back a good word of the people, may-be Mrs. Grafton will let me go to-morrow and see after them, and take what you would like to send; Won't that do?" "I suppose it must, but it is not like going oneself. Thank you, Mary, for your kindness," seeing that she looked disappointed. Then I'll go, Miss," and she was off in a moment,. Herbert had been looking on all this time in silence with open eyes and listening ears. He comprehended enough of the matter to know that something had gone wrong, and Delia had wanted to do something his father did not like. As she had often enforced upon him the duty of obedience, he did not quite understand why she was so unwilling to do as his father wished. is Tozen Dele look like she was naughty/" he broke out at last, looking gravely up at her still disturbed face. "And Cousin Delia is naughty," said she, snatch- ing him up and covering him with kisses; for his simple words of childish reproof had more effect upon her than an hour's reasoning and expostulation from an older person would have had. "Is tozen Dele solly?": asked the sturdy little mon- ster, little knowing how deeply his artless questions were probing her newly awakened conscience. As Delia did not immediately reply, the child con- tinued: "When Herby naughty tozen Dele say he must be solly, and say Herby solly." "4 Yes, Herby, I believe I am sorry now, and I will say so too as soon as I canll see your father."   DELI A, ARLIN TON-.     83 "Everybody don't say they're solly when they are naughty, tozen Dele. Mamma don't when she's naughty to Mary, and Rlia never do." "You can't judge, my dear little fellow, about such things; you can't understand." "Well, naughty is naughty, and dood is dood; you said so ittle while go." "So it is, dear, but you are a little fellow, and you can't tell when older people are naughty, you know." "Herby know when they look naughty; Herby do like tozen Dele just now; like Mamma, when she speak loud up, and look red, like you did. Herby like white face best," patting her now pale cheeks. As Delia was not prepared to vindicate herself to the child, or to talk with him about his mother, she endeavored to direct his attention to something else, and at last succeeded in doing so. Mary soon returned and told Delia that Barney was at home when she went to her cousin's, and at 'her request set off immediately for the place. "He will come round this evening and tell me all about it." "Thank you, Mary. I am so glad, for I promised the girl I would go there myself, and I know she was not imposing upon me." "Well, we shall see; Barney will look sharp. Come, Herby, we must go now." Delia was not sorry to be left to the companionship of her own thoughts, although she found them stern reprovers of her morning's fault. Judge Grafton did not convince her in the least, of the impropriety of the act she had meditated, but Mary's simple reasons had more weight with her. Still, in her youthful enthu- siasm, she could not quite see why it was not her duty to inquire personally into such cases of need, as   Ot4      STEP BY STEP,-OR, she had been allowed to do at home, being unwilling, as it seemed, to consider the difference between her former and present situation. Despite her doubts, however, upon this subject, she had none upon the folly and sin of giving way to her passionate feelings; for, although she had kept the angry words from her lips, the evil feeling was in her heart and fully expressed in her face. She had felt  keenly, too, little Herbert's reproof, deserved as she knew it was; and, moreover, she was greatly dis- pleased with herself that she had set such a bad ex- ample before a child, whom she fondly loved, and whose moral good she had much at heart. Childhood, in its native innocence, is uncompro- mising in its integrity, and no respecter of persons. It can see no reason why young and old should not conform to the same high standard,- why " naughty is not naughty, and dood is not dood," in one as well as another. Delia felt, that, as she stood condemned in'the eyes of that little child, who judged from outward signs, much more was she condemned in the sight of Him, whose eye readeth all the secret thoughts of the heart. Day by day came to her some new revelation of her true self, and now, as she pondered the matter, vain seemed all attempts to excuse herself. The reflection that she had never had such feelings at home, and that her present trying situation was in fault rather than herself, was immediately repelled by the more correct one, that no situation or circum- stances could ever call forth feelings which had no existence in the heart. Since she had them, she con- sidered it was one of her first duties to set about overcoming them. "But, oh, how shall I do it?"   DELIA ARLINGTON.      85 she inquired of herself, in humility and grief and shame. One thing was plain to her, she owed an apology to Judge Grafton for her " pertinacity," and, notwith- standing she could not have imposed upon herself a task more humbling to her haughty nature, she re- solved that the expiation should be made, although she thought it was quite uncertain how she would be received. Any fears, however, she might have on that score were groundless, as she would have known had she been older and possessed a better acquaint- ance with human nature. Judge Grafton was a man of respectable talents, and in matters of law, of good judgment; but, as it has been seen, he had his weaknesses, not the least of which was that petty tyranny which delights in the exercise of authority over those towards whom he stobd in any relations of superiority. Consequently, when Delia again knocked at his library door, and with every appearance of sincerity acknowledged her fault and apologized for it, he heard her graciously, and then waving his hand pompously, begged that she would give herself no farther trouble about it. At the dinner table that day he was so unusually attentive to her, that Maria looked up with astonish- ment, and Fred significantly raised his eyebrows and looked at Clara, as if to ask, "What next?" Barney's report of the family he was sent to visit was so satisfactory as it related to the child's truth- fulness, and so touching as it related to their destitu- tion, that Mary was resolved to ask Mrs. Grafton to allow her to go and see them, if Delia should fail in the petition she-was determined to make to her aunt, as in all probability she would. 8   86      STEP BY STEP,--OR,. The next morning, Delia gave her aunt a full account of the events of the preceding day; her in- terview with the Judge; his prohibition, and what followed; and ended with saying, "Since I am not permitted to go there, will not you go, aunt?" Mrs. Grafton was a nervous woman, and she stood almost aghast at Delia's temerity. "And you actually went to the library to make such a request of the Judge!9 " were her first words. "Why, child, how did you dare to do it?" ' "I was not aware of anything wrong in one or the other, aunt; I always had liberty to go to my father for advice, at any time." "To be sure, but my poor brother was peculiar, not like most men, you know; and Judge Grafton has so much important business on his mind, and he is accustomed, my dear, to be treated with the greatest deference. I wonder at you,--and for such a matter too, -of course he would refuse you." "I-shall not offend him in the same way again, aunt. But you have not told me whether you will go to see those people. I want to help them, and they are very poor." "Why, my dear, you have the strangest notions. Of course, I never go to such places,--the Judge does not approve of anything of the kind. I attend regularly to all the calls of charity in the church, and subscribe to every paper brought to me by those upon whom I can depend. There are city missionaries and such people to look after the poor. I surely have not the time."  "Will you write a line to the city missionary, then, and ask him to find them out?" "I have no acquaintance with him, child. Besides   DELIA ARLINGTON.      87 the Judge thinks these over-benevolent people are often very injudicious in their charities, helping those who might help themselves, and so encouraging idle- ness and crime." Delia was a reflective girl, as it has been said, and as her aunt uttered these words, she could not but contrast, in thought, her situation in all its daily splendor and luxury, with time for gay company and every idle and frivolous pursuit, which the votaries of fashion engage in, with that of the poor family bear- ing their daily burden of privation and suffering. The inconsistency, in this case at least, of the plea of want of time, or fear of encouraging idleness, stood revealed before her in its true light. She thought, however, she would make one more attempt. "Barney says there is no sickness there that is con- tagious, aunt, and the place is neat; may not Mary go to-day after I get home from school, if I will take care of little Herbert?" "t How obstinate you are. As Maria says, if you get an idea, you'll never let it alone till you've had your way. Yes, I suppose Mary can go if there is no danger; but don't ask me such a thing again." Delia thanked her aunt for this ungracious consent, and ran to tell Mary, then hastened away alone to school; for Clara, who had looked in a few minutes when Delia was talking with her mother, had gone without her.   STEP BY STEP,--OR, CHAPTER    IX. "Learn more reverence - But for Adam's seed, MAN! Trust me 'tis a clay above your scorning. With God's image stamped upon it, and God's kindling breath with- in."              E. B. BARRETT. ON arriving at school, Delia found, that, for the first time, she was late. At recess, she went to Mrs. Den- nett's private room to make her excuse, although she did not know very well how to do it. She told her, however, that her tardiness was unintentional, - that she was so engaged talking with her aunt, she was not aware of the lateness of the hour. Her teacher at first looked grave, but the frank sincerity of her pupil's manner, and her usual correct deportment and attention to the rules of school, convinced her 'that the offence was not likely to be one of frequent oc- currence, and she told her she would overlook it. But Delia still lingered as if she wished to say something more. "Do you want anything, my dear?" inquired Mrs. Dennett, observing her; "I like to have my pupils consider me their friend." "I only wished to say, that you advised me some days since to cultivate the acquaintance of my school- mates. I think I should like to be intimate with Helen Temple, but she does not appear to care for me." "Some of my pupils, I am  sorry to say, treat Helen so coldly, that she is very diffident about mak- ing or receiving advances, and probably it has never   -DELIA ARLINGTON.      89 occurred to her, that you could desire her acquaint- ance. But if you really do, by coming frequently to my room at recess, you will often meet her here; for she generally comes in to sit with me if I am unoc- cupied. She's a young lady for whom I entertain a very high esteem, for her own as well as for her mother's sake. I should be glad to see you friends.- I wish to ask you a question, Delia." "Yes, Ma'am." '4 Why did you treat Elenor Thompson coldly, al- most haughtily, the other day, when she invited you with your cousin to her little sister's party?" "I thought she might have had more feeling than to have supposed I cared to go to a party,--and, and,-" "And, what?" "And then she dresses so foolishy. Indeed, Mrs. Dennett, I cannot like her." "But we are commanded in the Scriptures to do more than that, even to love our enemies." "I know it, but I think very few do,; and, I'm sure I could never love a girl like Elenor Thompson. Do- you think I ought, Mrs. Dennett? Do you think that passage of Scripture is to be understood literally?" "The text clearly explains itself, I think. You ought to love your enemies enough at least to do what is required of you, in the conclusion of the same verse, -' Do good to them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.' When any one is in a state to do this, he will not too curiously inquire about the kind of love that prompts him to do it. I should not expect you to love Elenor Thompson as you are pre- pared to love Helen Temple, because you have not so many tastes in common; but'I think it unfortu- 8'   90      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, nate for a young person to be quite so fastidious in the choice of her acquaintances; not that I would have you go to the extreme of youthful confidences, and ardent friendships with all the girls you meet; but as necessarily, if you live, you will be thrown into the society more or less intimate of many per- sons with whom you cannot have much sympathy, strive, while you are young, to cultivate an interest in those by whom you are surrounded. If Elenor has her weak points, -as who has not,-I know she has also sterling traits of character,-perhaps some day you will find them out. In all your judg- ments of your schoolmates,- for here you have your future life before you in miniature, - remember who it is that maketh you to differ. But it is time to to close our conference. I hope you have received kindly this advice. I have been much interested in you since you have been a member of my school, and have your welfare truly at heart." Delia thanked Mrs. Dennett warmly for her kind- ness, and returned to the school-room. Upon entering she saw a knot of girls around Clara, who were evi- dently expatiating upon some subject, that greatly interested them. As she drew near she heard her cousin say; "Oh yes, she has all those out-of-the-way notions, and Maria says, she expects she'll set up for a Mrs. Fry, or a Dorothea Dix." Delia knew at once that her cousin was talking about her, as she had heard Maria one day make a very similar remark. With heightened color she joined the group, before they were aware of her presence, and said: "If you are talking about me, Clara, you should at least give me an opportunity to defend myself." "Oh!" said Clara, not the least abashed, " the outs a '   sst=) lit a = 5 i, r ,   DELIA ARLINGTON.      91 girls asked how our pattern scholar came to be tardy to-day, and I was telling them all I knew about it, which was not much, to be sure, as I only heard you teasing mother to let you go to some low, poor place or other, and then I added gratis a little infor- mation as to your tastes and pursuits." "It is hardly fair in you, Clara, to say, that we asked the question in that form;' said Adie Law- ton. "I said I wondered how it was, that one so particular in conforming to the rules of the school happened to be late." "La, what difference does it make? It all amounts to the same thing, I fancy." "Not quite," said Delia, "I at least have no wish to be called the pattern scholar." "Or a Mrs. Fry, or a Mrs. Dix either?" said Clara provokingly. "You'll have to get used to it, I can tell you. We give all our remarkable scholars titles or names, to distinguish them from us poor plodders. Now there's Amelia, she knows she'd be an orna- ment to any school, on account of her literary attain- ments, and she's willing to be called so; Elenor here is the mirror of fashion; Adie is our millionaire; Rosa White our model of propriety; Helen Temple, our meek charity student; and you, to end the list, our philanthropist." "And Clara Grafton, our would-be wit," said Adie Lawton, somewhat angrily. "You may call yourself, and those girls who like it, whatever names you please, but I don't choose to be singled out, because my father happens to be rich." "And I am sure, if I am devoted to intellectual pursuits, I do not wish, on that account, to be dis- tinguished from my fellow pupils," said Amelia,   92      STEP BY STEP,--OR, "though 'tis true the path of science has great attrac- tions to me." "And if you do call me a mirror of fashion, Clara, it isn't because 1 care so much more about dress than the rest of you, only my mother likes to have me dress as I do. I would much rather be what you call your cousin. I wonder you should laugh at her for that, of all things. I should like to be benevolent, if I knew how," said Elenor Thompson. "I am surprised, Clara, that you should speak of Helen Temple as you do," said Delia, who had not found an opportunity to say anything before; "I should think, as a friend of our teacher, she was en- titled to more consideration, if for no other reason." "How very virtuous we girls have become all at once. New Yorli cannot furnish such another set of paragons, I'll be bound; each and all disdaining their separate qualifications for distinction, and not con- tent with that, fighting the battles of their absent neighbors; " said Clara, who, finding the popular current setting against her, determined to brave it out, notwithstanding. "It's news to me, though, that Elenor Thompson has such charitable feelings." "It is not to be supposed, that you can understand every person's private feelings," said Adie Lawton; "though if you will remember the day we overtook that poor woman, whose child was run over in the street, Elenor was the only girl among us who as- sisted her, and she, as we happened to know, gave money that was a present to her to buy a breast-pin with:" "More fool she, when she knew nothing about the woman," answered Clara. "Foolish or not, it showed at least a kind heart."   DELIA ARLINGTON.       93 a There's the bell, and I'm glad of it, since you've all become so wonderfully good," said Clara. Mrs. Dennett having received an exaggerated re-  port of Delia's philanthropy, as her cousin persevered in calling it, was interested to inquire into the matter. Accordingly one day, when Delia came to her private room at recess, as she was now in the habit of doing, she told her what she had heard, and added, that it would gratify her to know to what extent it was true. "Not, however, if you are unwilling to give me an account of it," she said, seeing, that her pupil hesitat- ed. "I only ask from an interest in you, and not that I assert any authority over you in anything of the kind. Enthusiastic young people sometimes go far- ther than prudence would warrant, even with the best intentions, and as the story I have heard makes you appear quite independent, not to say Quixotic in your ideas, I should like to compare it with your own statement." At the word Quixotic, Delia hastily looked up. Judge Grafton used the same word in her interview with him. Was it true or just in its application to her?"I will tell Mrs. Dennett all,'. she said to her- self, " and see what she thinks about it." She there- fore stated all the circumstances connected with the affair that concerned herself, saying as little as possi- ble, to give a just representation of it, about Judge Grafton, or her aunt. s( Rather a different statement from that I have- heard, my dear,' said Mrs. Dennett, smiling. "But you must allow me to say, that Judge Grafton was right in refusing to let you go, even under the pro- tection of a servant. New York is full of impostors, and you are quite too young to" be allowed to go   "     STEP BY STEP,----OR,  about among the poor, unless it is well known who and what they are; and, even under such circum- stances, I do not think it would be judicious for you to do it in a city lile this, excepting in rather extraor- dinary cases. It requires both maturity of judgment and experience to know how to assist even the de- serving poor." "I know it, ma'am," said Delia sadly, " but what can I do? I have always been taught to lay by a certain sum out of my allowance for the poor, and if I do not seek out worthy objects upon whom to be- stow it, how am I to do any good with it, with no one to advise me? My aunt tells me to put my money into the church contribution, and then I shall be spared all trouble about it, and be sure that it is appropriated to a good use; but my father taught me never to avoid trouble in assisting others, but always to judge for myself, as far as I could, of the needs of the suffering. He used to say, that I could never feel for the poor, if I only heard or read about them, seated in my own comfortable home." "' Very true, my dear; but trite and commonplace as the maxim is, there never was a truer one, than the old copy, 'circumstances alter cases.' You sure- ly were never allowed to go about alone in Buffalo even, or with only such protection as the average of New York servants could afford you?" "Oh no, ma'am, old nurse often went with me, or her daughter Ann; and if it was a place I knew about, one of the men servants went, sometimes my father, but not very often, for he generally wished me to judge for myself and bring him a'report." "He advised you, did he not?" "Certainly; I always consulted him. Sometimes   DELIA ARLINGTON.      95 he let me do as I thought best, and if I made a mis- take he told me of it, if I did not find it out first, which I most always did." "Well, my dear, you surely see the difference be- tween your situation now and what it was then. You must be content at present to do all the good you can through others, and wait with patience the time when increased experience will render it safe for you to go about in a city like this, where the matur- est judgment is often taken in by the impositions of those, who have been trained from their infancy to deception and falsehood. As this individual case seems to interest you so much, perhaps I can find time to go and see the family. If they are really as deserving as you think, they will soon find friends, you may rest assured; and perhaps in time Judge Graf- ton will grant you permission to go with me to see them." "Oh, I wish he would. Mary, little Herbert's nurse, went for me, and she says they are a very nice looking family, although they are so poor, and I thought her judgment could be relied on, because she is a very sensible girl for one in her condition." "Sit down, Helen, do not go out,' said Mrs. Den- nett to Helen Temple, who stood irresolute at the door, seeing the two so busily engaged, "Miss Arling- ton will not object to your hearing what she. has to say, I am sure." "Oh, no, indeed; pray come in, do Helen," said Delia warmly. Thus urged, Helen entered and' sat down. "What is the name of this poor man?" inquired lMrs. Dennett. "Garter, ma'arn, Hobson Carter; a queer name, isn't it?"   au    STEP BY STEP,--OR, "Hobson Carter!" said Helen, rising from her seat, "did you say? Where does he live? Where did he come from?" "From Y   , and he now lives in. - Street, No. -. Do you know anything about him?" "It must be the same family my mother has so long been trying to find. They lived in Troy years ago, when we resided there. My mother can never forget how much we owe to Mr. Carter; it was he, who rescued my brother from the water, when he fell in at the steamboat landing. They moved to Y---. about the time we came to the city, and we had not heard anything about them for a long time, until some weeks ago we saw Mrs. Carter's death in the papers, but we haven't been able to find out where they live. I am so glad to know where they are. Mother will go to see them this very day, I am sure." "You see, my dear, your cousin has really rendered you a great service by her report of your proceed- ings," said Mrs. Dennett, much interested. This poor family will find old friends, and you and Helen, I hope, having common interests, will be drawn more towards each other. I should like to see you friends." As the two girls returned to the school-room to- gether, Helen Temple's studious face more than usually animated, and Delia, with that bright enthu- siastic look so peculiar to her when she was pleased, the other scholars looked surprised, and Clara said, flippantly: "A new conjunction, meekness and philanthropy united in the closest bonds of friendship!" and then, impatiently, "I wonder what absurd freak Delia will take next. If she thinks my father will allow her to   DELIA ARLINGTON.      97 be intimate with a charity scholar, and the daughter of a woman who takes in sewing for a living, she'll find herself mistaken, I can tell her." This was said in a low voice to Amelia Danforth, who with Adie Lawton, was standing near her. "Of course he will not," replied Amelia, with a very self-satisfied air. "Why, my mother will not permit me to go to a bookstore without some one to look after me, lest I should form improper acquaint- ances through my fondness for literature. You know these writers are shocking low people some- times." Clara turned upon her a look of contempt. The idea of a girl, whose father has just risen from the lower ranks of society by no other power than that of wealth, giving herself such airs, appeared to her most preposterous. She would have spoken as saucily as she felt, had not Adie Lawton said indignantly: "Mrs. Temple's connections are as respectable as any in the country; she is a woman of education and refinement; and if she does ornamental work for a living, the more is it to her credit. For my part, I consider Helen Temple equal to any girl in school, and should be glad to have her for a friend, if she would have me." "You don't say anything about that intellectual  youth, Helen's brother, who is studying for the min- istry," said Clara, provokingly. "How much has he to do with your good opinion of the merits of the family?" "Something, I own," replied Adie, coldly, but per- fectly unmoved. "I never spoke to him in my life, - but I should think he would be an honor to any family, judging from his countenance." 9   98      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, "Every one to his fancy. I've no tastes natural, or inherited, for poor people, and am quite content with girls of my own set, if they are not quite so wise and proper as Helen Temple." The next day Delia had the satisfaction of hearing from Helen, that her mother had been to see the Car- ters, who were the family she had been so long seek- ing, and that she would interest some of the wealthy ladies who employed her in them. She slipped a sum of money into Helen's hand; saying, as she did it, "If your mother will be so very kind as to use this for them as she thinks best, she will do me a great favor, since I am not permitted to go there myself." Helen thanked her. The conversation that followed between the two girls relative to the Carters, occupied the greater part of the time of recess. From that day forward their intimacy increased. Mrs. Dennett regarded with pleasure the growing friendship of these two interest- ing and gifted young persons, so widely different in character and position. '   DELIA ARLINGTON.       99 CHAPTER     X. "I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me."' SHAKESPEARE. ' Countless the various species of miankind, Countless the shades that separate mind from mind." THE Christmas holidays had come, bringing with them a round of festivities, in which Delia did not care to participate, so vividly did this season bring before her mind all that she had lost: a fond, devoted and revered parent, and a home of which she had been both the light and the pride.. Could she rejoice with those that rejoiced, when there seemed to be no one to mourn with her who mourned, or who sympathized with her in her feel- ings? No! she could not, but she would shut herself up, and in the solitude of her own room live over the happy past. This was her first thought. But as she reflected, .he asked herself, "Would this be right? Would her father .approve of it?" Both her conscience and her heart answered, No. So after a season of severe mental conflict, she concluded to mingle with the family as usual, and as far as pos- sible, without doing violence to her feelings, enter into their home festivities, and do all in her power to add to the happiness of those around her. The divine spirit of the Gospel had not yet wrought deep enough nor powerfully enough within her, nor had it attained sufficient influence over her to enable her to realize that, independently of outward circum- stances of joy or sorrow, this was emphatically a sea-   100      STEP BY STEP,-- OK, son for praise and gladness; since to her as well as to others, Christ was born and a Saviour sent into the world; and that!"Glory to God in the Highest, i Peace on earth, good will toward men:" should be the thanksgiving anther upon every lip. She did not feel this, for she was not yet fully consecrated to her Divine Master, nor had she yet experienced in its fulness, that inward peace which comes of listening to Him,-that Elder Brother and Saviour of man- kind, who is ever saying, "Come- unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." True, she daily read her Bible and offered her morning and evening prayers at the altar of the Most High, but the deepest and holiest feelings of her heart had never yet been awakened; or if, at times, their hidden fountain was touched by some appeal to her conscience in the Sabbath ministrations, upon which she attended, or by some soul-stirring hymn or chant, no permanent impressions had been made. That change, to be wrought in her to make her a true child of heaven, awaited the time when a better knowledge of herself would enable her to comprehend, as she could not do now, the surpassing holiness of the Sinless One, and to have a profound sense of her need of him. But step by step she was travelling the right path, and, although devious ways might, for , a while, allure her wandering feet aside, she was, on the whole, progressing. In pursuance of her resolution, Delia determined to join a party Clara was to give to some of her young friends. Maria did not hesitate to say she was glad of such an opportunity to mingle in gayeties, which custom prohibited her from seeking abroad; and   DELIA ARLINGTON.       101 Clara, who, as we have seen, was at times ill-natured, repeated the remark to Delia. The latter merely an- swered, she was sorry Maria should so misjudge her, and then added: "I thought, Clara, you would like to have me present. If I should not come down stairs, I suppose the girls would think me odd." "Oh, so I should, for you'll take Adie Lawton off my hands. I didn't mean to invite her; but mother said I must." "The more I know Adie, the better I like her," answered Delia, " she's so honest, and I don't believe she means half she says." "I don't care whether she does, or not; I'm not going to be the subject of her smart speeches. If her father wasn't rich, she'd never be tolerated." "Is Elenor Thompson to be here?" "Oh, yes, to be sure. The walking fashion plate cannot be left out. We should not know  how to have our dresses made for the rest of the season with- out her. Elenor is always a little in advance of the mode." "She said she didn't like to dress so, didn't she?" "Why, yes, and I don't think she does, since the girls laugh at her so much; but her mother is a weak one, I can tell you, if she does visit in the first society. Mother says nobody but new people ever dress so; but she's mistaken, as Elenor is proof." "I don't see why good or bad taste should be con- fined to any class of society." "I don't suppose it is, but I can't stop to talk any more now. There's the bell. I hope it's my dress come at last. Do you know  I have the dearest wreath to wear on my head; not just such as Maria 9*   102      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, has, for she's come out, and I'm not; but a beauty for all that. We're to have Laroux to play and call figures. What a pity you can't dance. Eustace Fitz James and Lester Parker are splendid waltzers. I am glad you're coming down. You'll help enter- tain all the stupids and disagreeables; that's a good girl." As Clara ran off, Delia could but smile at her un- disguised selfishness. "Better though," she thought, "be honest than to affect an interest which she did not feel." Sure enough Elenor Thompson was dressed in the extreme of fashion, in striking contrast in this particu- lar to Adie Lawton, who aimed, as Clara whispered, at severe simplicity. Adie soon sought Delia out, and with her usual free license of speech, commenced her comments on the company. "I declare. if here isn't New York in little. How these girls are dressed out with their laces, silks and jewelry, - how absurd." "' Not so absurd in them as in their parents, it seems to me,' replied Delia: "True enough, there's poor Elenor a complete victim to her mother's mania for dress: there's no, outlandish or outre fashion comes along that Mrs. Thompson does not rig her daughter up in. By the way, do you know Elenor's real baptismal name?" "No, unless it is Elenor." "Catch Mrs. Thompson at that. She meditated a whole week before accepting her husband on account of his name, but finally the balance turned in his fa- vor, as no one else proposed, and his Christian name is St. Clair. But she has made up for its plebeian   DJELIA AK1.NL, 1 UNN.   VU sound, as she considers it, by giving to her children all the names she can tack together. For instance, Elenor is Elenora Rosumanda Hortensia. It is, and the others are after the same pattern. I protest," continued the volatile girl, " if there isn't Esther Roy in a brocade. I wonder what these girls will wear when they come out. How I should detest to be a walking advertisement of my father's wealth." Delia glanced at her companion's plain pink chally, thd skirt simply tucked, and entirely without trim- ming, except the lace on the sleeves and neck, and could but acknowledge that she had some reason for her satirical remarks about the other girls. "One would think you had great contempt for money, and all that money buys," answered Delia. "I despise the use that is often made of it, and the pride that attaches to it for the most part. I don't think, however, we can settle the matter about the right use of wealth if we talk about it forever, but it vexes me to see how much influence it has. Do you think the girls at school would bear as much from Helen Temple as they do from me? No, indeed, and that makes me worse and worse, and I say the most provoking things I can think of, to tee if I can't make them forget my father is rich." "If I were you, Adie, I wouldn't think about it at all. I don't quite agree with you, though. I don't think school girls are generally respecters of persons; they laugh at a poor girls clothes just as they would laugh at any other peculiarity in some one else. Neither you nor I are really as much liked in school as Helen Temple." "Perhaps not, so far as school is concerned, but in society it is quite different. Helen is not invited to parties as you and I are," ,             .  ,   104      STEP BY STEP,---OR, "No. In that I suppose the girls do as their parents set them the example." "Look, Delia, look, there's Eustace Fitz James and Clara going to waltz. Isn't that an amusement for refined society in the nineteenth century?" "Don't you waltz?" "I? Do you?" "No, but I thought everybody did here in New- York." "I don't see," said Adie, bluntly, " why you should think everybody alike in New York. 1 suppose there are people possessed of common sense and real deli- cacy and refinement in New York as well as else. where. I shall begin to think Clara was right when she said you thought there was nothing good out of Buffalo." "I am sorry to have hurt your feelings, but I don't know anything more about fashionable society in Buffalo than I do about it in New York. My father never wished me to learn to waltz, but I have been told so often, since I came here, that he was peculiar, I supposed that might be one of his peculiarities." "Well," said Adie, a little mollified at Delia's statement, ,' you were mistaken, that's all. My father and mother never wished me  to waltz, and my brother, who is now in India, used to say, if young ladies only knew  what remarks gentlemen make about their waltzing, - the very gentlemen who waltz with them,--they never would do it again. Of course, he did not tell me what they said, but I know him well enough to be certain they make shocking remarks. As I don't wish you to have too poor an opinion of me, Delia, I might as well tell you, that I got my way- of talking from my brother. J   DELIA ARLINGTON.      105 Something, I don't know what, happened to disgust him with society, and he wouldn't go anywhere for a year before he left home, and then took a sudden start for India." "He must have had some reason for feeling and speaking as he did, I don't doubt, but I can't see what cause you have to speak as you do. I wouldn't, if I were you." "Well, you are the first girl who ever gave me such sensible advice, - I'll try to follow it. See, they are getting up a cotillon, and I, who love to ,dance dearly, will join them if anybody I like asks me; no, what will you do? 1" "Never mind me, I like to look on. But now I am going to have a talk with Elenor, who looks so dismal over there." "I wish you joy of your undertaking, if you expect to get anything out of her." Delia was not to be deterred from making the at- tempt, however. Elenor at first appeared embarrassed and quite disinclined to make conversation; but the real kindness of her companion's manner soon reas- sured her, and Delia was surprised to find so much thought and feeling beneath her frivolous and absurd exterior, and they chatted very pleasantly together, until they were interrupted by the return of Adie Lawton, who sat down in a chair near them and began fanning herself violently. "I've had a grand dance," she said, " and now must cool off before I go home. Do you see that exquisite of fifteen Iwith all the airs of a man of fashion of twenty-five, talking to your cousin, Delia? I'm not going to have a juvenile party, so don't you make up your mind for any such thing. It's too absurd for me."   106      STEP BY STEP,--OR, "I shouldn't think you would go to them," said Delia, gravely, " if you find so much to disapprove of in them." "Oh, I like to dance, and mother won't let me stay  at home always; and besides, I like to see how ridic- ulous people will make themselves." "You are honest, certainly." "Yes, I hope I am that. Will you come to see me before the holidays are over?" "With-pleasure, Adie." "There's a ring. That's the carriage for me, I'm sure; so good night, Delia." "It is early; nobody is going yet." "I am,- I don't stay out till midnight to parties; my mother doesn't wish to have me. Remember your promise, and come to see me soon. My mother will be delighted to know I have made one steady acquaintance. Have you ever been to see Helen Temple, yet i" "No, she with her mother and brother is away on a visit, for the holidays." "How could Mrs. Temple go at this time, when there is so much work in demand in her line?" "She was sick, and some kind friend insisted upon her leaving everything. I shall go to see Helen when they return." "Are you sure of it?" "Certainly; why do you ask?" "No matter now. Good night."    CHAPTER XI. "And she spoke such good thoughts natural, as if she always thought them."           E. B. BARRETT. "You see I am as good as my word, Adie," said Delia, a few days later, as she sat in Mrs. Lawton's front drawing-room. "Thank you for coming, but how did you find your way here without Clara?" "We drove down, and Clara left me to call on you, while she went to visit some of her acquaintances in this neighborhood." "Oh, that's it; Miss Clara is not over fond of vis- iting me, but I'm glad to have you to myself. You're really refreshing, after all the miniature men and women one meets. Confess now, that you never saw such a saucy school-girl as I am before." "I am acquainted with a very few girls out of our school, you know," said Delia, smiling. "I understand; you're too polite to say just what you think about me, but I know all the same. I sometimes wish I was different," she added, seriously, "for my mother's sake. I think my spirits are too much for her nerves sometimes, and then she doesn't like me to talk so freely as I do about people. She never does herself. But I can't help it, so it's no use to try. Seriously, Delia, how do you like New York in general, and the select fashionable circle at your Aunt Grafton's in particular. Wasn't that a great party of Clara's the other night, and don't you think we're a great people?"   108      STEP BY STEP,--OR, "I think," said Delia, laughing, "you are a strange girl to make so much fun of your native city. It didn't appear to me that all the girls at Clara's party were as ridiculous, either in dress or manner, as you seemed to think they were. But it puzzles me to understand why you and Clara talk so much as you do about first circles, parvenues," &c. "I talk so, because I despise all these distinctions in society, and make all the fun I can out of them. I fancy Clara talks, as she does, because with all due respect to you, Judge Grafton and his family have the weakness of priding themselves upon what is un- doubtedly their right, a position in the first circles in New York. Are you satisfied?" "I suppose I must be, but at the same time I do not see why you should despise these distinctions. It seems very natural that there should be such. There are differences among people in taste and edu- cation and refinement, and why should not those associate together who have most in common?" "All that is very proper, but when it comes to making mere wealth the standard of gentility, it's too much for me. But I tell you what it is, Delia, if you go on in this way, inquiring into the why and where- fore of all the queer things you meet in this city, you'll have more than you can do. I'm no philoso- pher, and as long as I can't remedy follies, I get all the sport I can out of them, thereby making myself as ridiculous as those I laugh at, I suppose you think. But come, I want you to know my mother; you'll think me a stranger girl than ever, when you see how different she is from me." And Adie took her visitor up stairs to her mother's apartment. Mrs. Lawton, who was a good deal of   DELIA ARLINGTON. *     109 an invalid, was seated in a large old-fashioned arm- chair, drawn up beside a window, which looked down into W   Park. She greeted Delia kindly, and said: "I feel acquainted with you already, Adie has spoken of you so frequently. I am very glad to see you. "Yes, mother really has hope of me now. You don't know what a transformation you are expected to work in my character." "An unreasonable expectation, Miss Arlington will think, since I have been able to do so little in that way," replied Mrs. Lawton, faintly smiling. "Oh, well, mother, some day I shall set up for a pattern, you may be sure. Delia doesn't know what; to think of our house and furniture, so unlike his honor Judge Grafton's," continued the lively girl, as she noticed her visitor's glance turn from one old- fashioned article to another. "Why, Adie!" said Delia, a little embarrassed, "I havn't said a word about either, have I?" "Said? No, indeed; what's the use of saying any- thing with your lips when your face says so much for you? Now be honest and tell me, if you were not astonished when you walked into our drawing-rooms, to see those claw-footed tables, stiff, prim chairs, and comfort-defying sofas in the back parlor?" "Yes, I was," replied Delia, frankly, " and pleased too; for I felt at home at once, because everything looked so much as it used to at ." Here her voice slightly trembled, but conquering her emotion, she turned to Mrs. Lawton and said, "I am a very foolish young girl in some things, I am afraid, for I cannot 10   J1V      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, get quite accustomed to the great change in my life, and I don't know as I ever shall." This was said in a tone so sad, that Mrs. Lawton's kind sympathies were at once aroused, and she said: "It is very natural that you should find it difficult to accommodate yourself at once to what must, from Adie's account of you, be an entirely new aspect of life to your experience. But 'Time, the corrector where our judgments err,' will unfold to you much that is pleasant as well as salutary, I do not doubt, in what you now find it so difficult to be reconciled to." "I don't know, Ma'am, it seems to me I never shall like New York, or rather the way people live here." "And how do you imagine people do live here?" "Oh they appear to me to live more for pleasure than anything else; and then it is considered such a crime to be unfashionable in dress or manners." "Are you not judging too hastily, my dear? Your circle of acquaintance cannot yet be very extensive in the city." Delia blushed, for she felt Mrs. Lawton's kind re- buke was deserved, and immediately replied: "It is true, Ma'arm, I do not know mnuch'about New York society, but then I hear so much about such things at my Aunt Grafton's, I thought nothing else was considered of importance." "That in fact," interposed Adie, " we Gothamites deserve the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, since not ten righteous could be found within our gates. Oh, most lenient judge, thy tender mercies are indeed cruel." "Your error is a common one, my dear young friend," continued Mrs. Lawton, without noticing her daughter's interruption. "Older persons than your-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      1ll self not unfrequently judge the unknown many from the known few; and also make the mistake that wealthy and fashionable people are necessarily cold- hearted and selfish." "Is it not generally so, Ma'am?" "I think not. New York is a world in miniature, with its crowded population, composed of people of almost all nations and tongues. If one finds here all the vices chargeable to mankind, one may find here also, I am quite sure, all the virtues likewise. I have lived in this city nearly sixty years as child, girl, and woman, and have a large acquaintance in the different ranks of its society. I know some families so given up to pleasure and fashion, as the end and aim of existence, that they make life an empty show and an idle pageant. I know others, among those too dwell- ing in expensive and luxurious abodes, faring sump- tuously and dressing elegantly every day, --for they have been so educated, and habit to them is second nature,--who are kind, and charitable, and Christian; whose rich apparel costs far less thought, and covers far less pride, than is often the case with the votaries of fashion in many a retired country town; others still I know, whose meat and drink'it is to serve their Lord and Master by holy lives and the alms deeds which they do. I rejoice in the belief, that if fashion and frivolity, pride and arrogance walk boldly in the streets, and have become almost a by-word and re- proach to us, there is a reverse side to the picture, which does us quite as much credit as a Christian people as this disgraces us." Yes," interrupted Adie, "Mother thinks, I sup- pose, Delia, that society here is like a dish of trifle,- uppermost is the whipt cream which makes a great    .                     .   "2      STEP BY STEP,--OR, show, but is as empty and unsubstantial as one of our fashionable ladies; below is the cake, pleasant to the taste and nourishing to the strength." "Or," said her mother smiling, "like a certain young lady whom I know, whose light words and flippant airs disguise a sound judgment and a warm heart." "I deserved that rebuke, mother," said Adie laughing, " but H can bear it, as Delia has come in for her share of, what shall I call it? not rebuke, but friendly counsel." "I was innocent of any intention of rebuking or offering counsel to your young friend," replied Mrs. Lawton.  "It would scarcely be hospitable td do either." "Perhaps the pill was so well sugared, Delia swallowed it unawares. But here's a summons for you; 'Miss Clara Grafton's carriage waits at the door." "Will you not come to see us again, Miss Ar- lington, if my giddy daughter does not frighten you. I am very fond of the society of young people, and I promise not to give you a sugared pill the next time." "( Oh, I shall be very glad to, Mrs. Lawton, and I am really very much obliged to you for what you have said to-day. As to the pills, of which Adie speaks, I could swallow a great many such." Delia returned home much pleased with her visit, and resolved to. continue the acquaintance. True, Adie Lawton was not just to her taste, but her per- fect sincerity covered in her eyes a multitude of minor defects of character, and beside, there was something attractive in lively manners to one of a   DELIA ARLINGTON.      lid graver temperament. The real kindness which Adie always evinced, when there was the slightest call for it, even to those of her schoolmates whom she spared least in her reckless speech, proved, she felt, that her heart was right. In fact a great deal of her volubili- ty was only the effervescence of youthful spirits, which time would infallibly moderate and subdue. Delia was also very much interested in Mrs. Law- ton, and grateful to her for the few words which had dispelled some of her unfounded prejudices. She saw now how one-sided a view she had been taking of the society in New York, because she herself hap- pened unfortunately to be a member of a worldly and fashionable family. As they drove home, she no longer looked upon every stately mansion they passed as necessarily the abode of folly and pride, nor every richly dressed lady she saw, one whose heart was seared and callous, and given over to the world. She possessed a nature so essentially noble, and a con- science so unperverted, that it was olily necessary to point out the right to convince her of error. She was not one of those who delight in fostering preju- dices once conceived. Her heart was the good ground, where good seed would take root and bring forth fruit an hundred fold. But open as her candid and ingenuous mind was to conviction, and progress- ing as she evidently was in the right path, her steps were sometimes apparently retrograde, as well as for- ward, like the rising tide, whose waves recede as they advance, while they are continually gaining upon the shore. She not only had her hitherto undeveloped faults to contend against, but she also had those difficulties and doubts which beset the path of every earnest 10*   "4      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, seeker after truth to combat and overpower. Igno. rant of the experience of others, she knew not that he, who would wear the crown, must bear the cross, that "Through night to light, Through storm to calm," must every soul pass ere it is purified and redeemed. Her mind too, at times, was oppressed with sadness at her own desolate situation, as it seemed to her. The following extract from a letter to her uncle will serve to show the state of her feelings at this time. "' It is New Year's Eve, my dearest Uncle Edward, and I have stolen away to my own room to talk awhile with you; would that I could do so face to face. To-morrow, my aunt, in conformity with the custom here, receives visits from all the gentlemen of her acquaintance. To tell the truth, I feel very sad and lonely to-night. I cannot help thinking about my dear, dear father, and how happy we all were at home a year ago, and how much better girl I seem to myself to have been then than I am now. Oh dear! how every day,brings out some new fault or weakness for me to' struggle against and strive to conquer,- and I feel very, very much dissatisfied with myself. "Sometimes I think if I only had a mother, or some one even, who would take a mother's interest in me, I should do a great deal better. While my father lived, I did not know what a loss it was to have no mother; now, oh uncle, my heart so longs for a mother's love to lean upon, and a mother's sympathy to encourage and aid me. Had I been more with my own sex, should I find it so very hard   DELIA ARLINGTON.      115 to be docile and submissive, and to practise those beautiful self-denying virtues inculcated in the New Testament? Why is it, that I find my life here such a warfare? "I met a lady a few days ago going about among the poor distributing tracts, and she told me, that, when she was a little girl, her heart was so wicked she actually hated God, and could never bear to read about Jesus Christ. It was shocking to hear her say so. I do not hate God, and I am sure I never did. I cannot remember the time when I did not like to hear about God; father used to talk so beautifully about Him. But God seems a great way off from me. I do not feel as I wish I could, that He was really my father, and loved me as my own father did. And Jesus Christ, he was such a pure and holy being. I do not dare to feel towards him as I do towards you, uncle. Is this because my heart is so wicked? "I thank you very much for your kindness in at- tending to my wishes about Sam and Jane, and all the poor people. I am so glad they call baby, George, for my father. May I not provide for him always? Please say I may, dear uncle. Give my love to dear old nursey. Shall I ever become one of the lambs of Christ's flock as she prayed I might the day I left home!  Horne! have I one? Where! ' Nor need we power or splendor, - Wide hall, or lordly dome; The good, the true, the tender, - These form the wealth of home.' " To this sad plaint of poor Delia's sorrowing heart, her uncle wrote lkindly and encouragingly. It is but   "6      STEP BY STEP,--OR E justice to her to say, that this extreme depression was only temporary, the natural result of the thick crowding memories of the season, and of her own sensitive conscience acted upon by the discerning of so many faults which she could not easily over- come.   lJDILIA ARLINGTON.      1.1  CHAPTER XII. "Ah yes, but then the world, what will the world say?" "Contentment wears a crown Where fortune hath denied it." "DID I hear you tell Helen Temple, you would go to see her Saturday afternoon, if you could, Delia?" asked Clara, as she and her cousin were walking home from school one day. "Yes." "Do you really expect to go? Do you think my father will allow it? You are the laughing stock of the whole school already, on account of your intimacy with her." "I see no reason why I should not, or why your father should object to it. Of course, I shall not go without permission." "You may save yourself the trouble of asking, then. Neither :father nor mother will ever consent to it. Father will never let his carriage be seen standing at Mrs. Temple's door, I can tell you." "It often stands at your dressmaker's and milliner's door. I don't see the difference." Because you won't see it, that's all." "I did'nt expect to go in your father's carriage. I can call one for myself, if it is too far to walk." "Oh yes, I forgot, we're an heiress and can do anything we like; but I should think you would con- sider it your duty to save the money for your paupers, rather than waste it on the useless luxury of a hired carriage."   "8      STEP BY STEP,--OR, "It would be better, I confess. I can walk or ride part of the way in an omnibus." "If you take an omnibus, see what my father will say to that. He'(d never forgive you." "It's no use discussing the question with you, Clara," said Delia, whose patience was fist giving way. "I shall certainly go, if possible;--but really it is a mystery to me, that you and the girls of your clique can find anything to dislike or object to, in such an amiable, lady-like girl as Helen Temple." "Oh, we don't dislike her particularly, only she has no business at our- school; the most aristocratic school in New York, and she, the daughter of a woman who earns her living by sewing." "I thought she had once been in different circum, stances, and moved in different society?" "I believe she has some very respectable connec- tions'; but Mr Temple was nothing but a country mninister; that's not a very high stations I reckon," said Clara contemptuously. Much to Delia's relief, they had now reached their own door. "Is Mrs. Grafton in?" she inquired of the pom- pous waiter, Taylor, who opened the door. "Mrs. Grafton came in half an hour since, and has not gone abroad again, to the best of my infor- mation, Miss Arlington," was the answer, accom- panied by a bow, and a condescending wave of the hand. Delia threw off her outer garments, and hastened to find her aunt, who was in her own room, deep in a discussion with Maria about a head-dress for a party. She hesitated a moment, when she saw Maria, but she was unwilling to retreat, and too proud to show   DELIA ARLINGTON.      119 any fear of her cousin. She told her aunt of her desire to visit Helen; and asked her if she had any objection to it, or if Judge Grafton would have any. "Why, what unaccountable whim has seized you now, Delia? Surely you have, or might have pleas- ant acquaintances enough in our own set, without visiting people no one knows." "I'm sure, mother," broke in Maria, "Mrs. Temple is well known for her beautiful embroidery and fine needle work." "Hush, Maria, you know what I mean. There are the Miss Van Tromps, Delia, you've never even returned their call; they are nice fashionable girls." "The Miss Van Tromps are not altogether to my taste, Aunt Grafton." ' There is Adie Lawton; you said you liked her, 'and we are perfectly willing you should visit her. The Lawtons are some of our first people, if they are old fashioned and peculiar. "I do like Adie Lawton, aunt, but not as I like Helen Temple. I love her very much already, and she is older than I am, and my superior in everything. Beside Adie Lawton can come to see me; Helen cannot. She has no time to visit,-and if she had, I should not think of asking her here without your per. mission. "I wish you would ask anything I could grant, Delia. Idon'tlike to refuse you. Why did'nt you go without saying anything about it, then there would'nt have been any fuss.'" "Because I did'nt think it right or proper, Ma'am, and I certainly did not wish to deceive you. I hope you don't think I would be so mean as to do without your permission what I thought you would object to," replied Delia almost indignantly. ,       4   [, tS, ^ ..1    LJ     STEP BY STEP,-- OR, "If Delia is going off into a fit of heroics, you might as well give up at once, mother," said Maria. "By all means let her have the carriage and servants to take her round the city to visit her distinguished friends. Judge Grafton's carriage in street at the Carter's? Judge Grafton's carriage in street, at Mrs. Temple's, would be a capital subject for that spiteful Mrs. Loomis to -get hold of, and entertain all her gossiping acquaintances with." "I did not ask your permission, cousin Maria," said Delia coldly, but still with great effort, retaining self-command. "I do not wish for the carriage, and have not asked for it. I believe you have no authori- ty over me." "No, lucky for you I haven't, or I'd soon curb your proud temper, cost what it might." So saying, Maria swept disdainfully past Delia and left the room. "Aunt," said Delia, as soon as Maria was gone, "please grant my request. I will not trouble you again very soon. If you could only see Helen, you would never object to my visiting her, I know, and I wish it very much." As Delia spoke with great earnestness, there was something in the expression of her face, that forcibly reminded Mrs. Grafton of her brother, the loved companion of her innocent girlish days, and she was really touched. She was a weak woman, governed almost entirely by her lordly husband, and imperious daughter; at the same time she was a woman of kindly impulses, only her heart was too deeply encrusted with worldly pride and ambition to allow her feelings proper exercise. "Well, well, child, if you're so set about it, I will see what the Judge says. Bless me, how late it is."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      121 "Thank you, aunt," said Delia as she retired to her own room. The desired permission was obtained from Judge Grafton, how ungraciously and unwillingly, Delia could only infer from the increased dignity of his manner towards her for some days following. Judge Grafton had his weak points, which his wife very well understood, and when she had any par- ticular object to gain, she would successfully play upon them, although for the most part she was under the influence of his arbitrary will. In the present case she adroitly intimated that there was danger, if they placed too great restrictions upon her niece, she would be disinclined to take up her abode perma- nently with them, being well aware, that he was by no means indifferent to the eclat of having so wealthy an heiress a resident in his family. She also repre- sented to him, that her niece came to ask permission, when she might have gone without it. Thus she at last succeeded in extracting a reluctant consent from him, but it was accompanied with the express stipula- tion, that Delia should never be taken to or from Mrs. Temple's in his carriage. His dislike to Delia, how- ever, increased in proportion to the little influence he had over her, and he showed it in so many annoying ways, that she sometimes found it hard to maintain towards him that demeanor of outward respect, which she considered to be his due. Delia took an early opportunity to visit Helen at her own home. She found mother and daughter busy at work in a small, plainly furnished, but per- fectly neat, and even tastefully arranged, apartment in the third story of a house, in a quiet orderly street, not many minutes walk from Broadway. Something Ln.  t. *   in the expression of Mrs. Temple's face added to her winning manners, at once attracted her young visitor towards her. She was apparently about forty-five years of age, and was still a beautiful woman, al- though her delicate cheek was pale and thin, and her dark hair was tinged with silver. She received Delia kindly, almost affectionately, making no apology for the work upon which she and her daughter still con- tinued engaged; feeling doubtless, as every true woman must, that labor is no degradation to one in her situation, but on the contrary, ennobling and ele- i vating in comparison with idle dependence. A stand of geraniums and roses attracted Delia's attention, and led to conversation about flowers, and thence to poetry, and from poetry to prose, and from books in general to the good or evil of particular kinds of reading, and so easy and unrestrained was it, that she forgot she was talking with a lady who until this day had been a stranger to her. Presently she said: "It's a shame for me to be idle and you so busy; I can sew very nicely; please, Mrs. Temple, let me help Helen, and then perhaps you will spare her to walk part way home with me." "I think I can do that without your assistance; I thank you for the offer." "Well, some other day I will bring my thimble. May I come here often, Mrs. Temple?" "To help us sew?" inquired that lady, smiling. I'm afraid that isn't the chief thing I want to come for. You'll let me come if I don't trouble you too much, will you not, Ma'am?" "I shall be very glad indeed to have you. Helen has quite too little society for a girl of her age. But   you must consider what you are doing, before you propose such a thing. Some of my employers are your aunt's acquaintances, and may at any time come in and find you here.  Should you mind that?" "Do you think I should?" replied Delia, looking very red and indignant. "No, I do not; but I wished to warn you. Well our compact is mnade. You shall come as often as you can find time, and bring us some of your young life and spirits to enliven us, while we 'ply the polished shaft' with willing minds and ready fin- gers." ' "But I want you to do something for me, Ma'am; you see I am not very disinterested after all." "With pleasure, if it is anything I can do." "I want you to advise me, and explain a great many things that puzzle me." "Advice is easily given, my dear Miss Arlington, and as to explaining many things that puzzle you, that may not be so readily done. But what do you want explained?" "Oh, a great many things. I don't understand all that I see about me. I don't understand why it is, since God has given us such a pleasant world to live in, and has made everything so beautiful in it's season, He permits man to spoil so much that He has done. God could prevent all this misery and suffering, could He not?" "God is omnipotent and all merciful, doubtless, but His ways are not as our ways, and His mysteries are past finding out! Why should we think to fathom Infinite Wisdom?   Your questions and doubts are natural to an ardent and inquiring mind. You feel perhaps as a poet has expressed it,-   124      STEP BY STEP,--on, O ' Nature does Never wrong - 'tis society that sins!' But such speculations are neither wise nor prudent, however natural they may be. We must be content not to understand anything more of the workings of the Divine will than what is plainly revealed to us; indeed it seems almost presumptuous to attempt to do so. We must have faith, and have it in full meas- ure. "Faith is the Christian's prop, Whereon his sorrows lean; It is the substance of his hope, His, proof of things unseen; It is the anchor of his soul, Whlen tempests rage and billows roll." "Ah, there's the trouble." "' Where?" "One must be very perfect indeed to have such faith as is described in that stanza." " And are we not commanded to be perfect, even as our Father in Heaven is perfect?" "Yes, but no one is; no one can be." "But all can strive to be. God's commandments must not be questioned. Whatever we are required to do, or to be, in the New Testament, we should seek to do and to become, not in our own strength, but in that, strength which God vouchsafes to all who put their trust in Him. And let me assure you, my young friend, faith is all and more than all that stanza makes it. You know our Saviour said, ' If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to' yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be im- possible to you.'"   DELIA ARLINGTON.     125 "The Saviour didn't mean to be understood liter- ally in that passage, did he?" 4"Perhaps not, but he unquestionably wished by it to enforce upon his disciples, that all things are pos- sible with God, and that He will grant every needed aid and blessing to the believing heart. The little child, who is a good illustration of faith in that repose or confidence in our Heavenly Father which it is, implicitly trusts in the loving tenderness of his earth- ly parent, and has no doubts whatever of his care and protection, and no anxieties with regard to the future. Had we such faith in God, should we have any doubts, fears, or anxieties about anything past, pres- ent, or future?--any lasting fears or anxieties I mean? for we are all at times under the shadow of a cloud." "I suppose not, but I cannot understand how it is." "I know we should not, and I testify of that which I have experienced, humble though my testimony may be," said Mrs. Temple, her usually calm coun- tenance lighted up with a radiant glow, which Delia felt must proceed from the holy of holies in the inner temple of her soul. 6"Oh wretched indeed, and down- cast should I have been in days past, and sad and. sorrowful should I be now, had I not that faith in my God which enables me to say and feel under the sorest afflictions, it is the hand of a loving and mer- ciful Father that chastens but to heal." There was a short pause, and Delia said sadly: "I must go now, or I shall be too late home for dinner. I will think of what you have been saying, Ma'am, and I hope it will do me good. I thank you very much for your kindness," she added as she warmly shook Mrs Temple's offered hand at parting. "-   126     STEP BY STEP,-- OR, "I hope you will not think me too forward in troub- ling you so early in our accquaintance with my per- plexities, but I could not help opening my heart to you, as I have done. As Helen's mother, you will be- friend me, I know." "It gratifies me, that you should so readily confide in me, and I shall be only too happy to give you all the aid in my power. You are young and have many blessings, and you must look hopefully to the future, in the persuasion, that if you seek aright, you will at last find that true peace, which the world neither giveth nor taketh away." Helen and Delia walked on together without speak- ing for a few moments. At length Delia said, "Gold and silver cannot buy for me the treasure which you possess in such a mother's love. I wondered when I first knew you, Helen, how you could bear the haughty treatment of those insolent girls at our school, but I understand it all now. Living in daily intercourse with one like your mother, insignificant, indeed, must all that they say or do seem to you." "But you do not yet know the half of my mother's excellencies," replied Helen, in the simplicity of her filial love. "I know enough to feel thoroughly humbled in her presence. Now can I ever be proud or disdainful again? But I shall be at home and with those tire- some school girls, I know." After Delia parted with Helen, she scarcely knew how the remainder of her walk home was accom- plished, so full were her thoughts of the visit she had made. She had never before met with such a woman as Mrs. Temple appeared to be, and her enthusiastic nature at once elevated her into an ideal of perfec- - t . w   JHAJLA ARLIlNGI'ON.   1 27 tion, which would have shocked that lady's Christian humility. "Yes" thought Delia, as she ascended the last flight of stairs that led to her own room, and brought her back again to her actual life, "there must indeed be a reality in religion, for it males that abode of poverty and trial seem, to me like the outer courts of heaven." ]    128      STEP BY -STEP,-- OR, CHAPTER X III. "It is not for me to stipulate for creeds; Bible, Church and Reason, These three shall lead the mind, if any can, to truth. But I must stipulate for faith ; both God and man demand it." THE winter months sped, and, for the most, pleas- antly with Delia. Her school studies and lessons in music, for which she had a decided talent, occupied a great part of her time. She had her recreations also, but so unlike were they to those of her cousins, that she did not escape being frequently assailed by them with the old charge of eccentricity. Mrs. Dennett obtained the permission she promised to seek for a visit to the Carters. Judge Grafton could not refuse the request of a lady who stood so deservedly- high in the community, and who was never known to act from the mere impulse of over- wrought feeling or momentary excitement. Having gone once under such a respectable protection, Delia was allowed to continue her visits occasionally, with the judicious restriction, that she should never go un- attended. Mary sometimes found leisure to go with her, and at other times Helen Temple, when she could afford herself the luxury of a Saturday's walk. These visits were not only a recreation to Delia, they were also very profitable to her in a spiritual re- gard. Mrs. Raw-son, the aged grandmother of the little Carters, was a truly beautiful example of the power of religion over the trials and sufferings which are the appointed lot of so many. Here was a woman, bent with the infirmities of age and life-long   DELIA ARLINGTON.     ' 129 toil, just able to move from one place to another, by taking hold of the articles of furniture for a support; surrounded by sickness and poverty; living in a con- fined court of a crowded city, where she was denied even God's free gift to all,-pure air; witnessing from day to day the labors of a woman prematurely forced upon her darling grandchild (for Susan Carter was the delight of her heart); and still amid all these, to the eye of the worldling, dark and discouraging sur- roundings, maintaining ever a cheerful deportment and a happy countenance. The sacred promises of the Bible, and the psalms and hymns of praise famil- iar to her from early youth, seemed the natural lan- guage of her pious and grateful heart, and came as spontaneously from her lips as idle and frivolous gossip frpm the worldly-minded. Her Christian char- acter and example were not lost upon her son-in-law. Previous to the accident which disabled him so long from labor, Mr. Carter had been a hard-working and honest man; always, although in that sphere of life in which so many mock at sacred things, respect- ing the institutions of religion and attending upon its services; but at the same time, knowing nothing of its power as the true and everlasting life of the soul. Months of bodily inactivity, however, accompanied by a good deal of suffering, together with the practi- cal example he ever had before him in the person of his wife's mother, of a devout and living faith, served to call up in his mind a train of serious reflections, which resulted in the end in bringing him in child- like faith and submission to the feet of his Saviour. Greatly did he rejoice his good old mother-in-law's heart, when he made known to her his interest in re- ligion, and acknowledged his indebtedness, under the   130     STEP BY STEP,- OR,  grace of God, to her example as a disciple of Christ, for the awakening of his spiritual senses. - Blessed be the name of our God forever and ever, my son," said the aged Christian, " that He has made his unworthy servant the humble instrument of bring- ing you out of carnal death into spiritual life. Truly now I can say, ' Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,' for my work on earth is well nigh donue." 4I'd hev' been wus than a heathen man, gran- marm, ef I could hev' seen you and my poor little gal there, with your good words propped up by your good works, bearing all our troubles enamost to star- vation so cheerily, without finding out what an un- grateful sinner I'd been. The day yoou sent Susan out a beggin' for bread, with a blessin' on her young head, when we hadn't nothin7 to eat in the house, and the look in y'r good old face that kinder .seemed to say, 'Godwill take care on us;' that's religion of the rale sort to my thinkin', said I to myself; and when she cum back with the bread to eat and the promise of help, I couldn't do nothin' but hide my head under the bed clothes, and cry away easy for nobody to hear. But that wan't all,Mis's Arlinter, (for Delia and Helen were present when this avowal was made,) arter a time my heart kinder growd hard like agin, and I said to myself, that young gal jest giv' Susy the bread to get rid on 'er.

Helen,) who my poor woman longed to see agin, and what with findin' old friends and the goodness of new ones, my stubborn heart gin right away, and I cried 'God be marciful to me a sinner."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      131 "God be merciful to us all, son Hobson, for we all need his mercy, and He is and ever will be merciful, if we seek Him." "Aye, aye, I bleve that now, but I didn't use to, for all you and Mary seemed so cheery under y'r troubles, I jest thought it's woman's natur' to take things easy like, and no religion at all about it; but I reckon on it now, that it's the true corner stone of everything. I spose I b'leved in religion 'fore I got it, but somehow I hadn't faith like gran'marm there." "Very few have, I'm afraid," said Delia, timidly; "I suppose the reason so many people lack faith is, because they believe with the understanding and not with the heart." "That's it just, Miss," said Mrs. Rawson. "Under- standing is very good in its place, but it will not make a true Christian without the heart goes with it. That's why so much is said in the Bible about a change of heart, I think; because we may believe forever and ever, and all the belief in the world will never bear fruit without the heart is changed; an when that's done, we're like little children again, in a state to be reconciled to God through the mediation of Christ our Redeemer." "Do you think, Mrs. Rawson, we hate God before we meet with this change of heart? Some people say we do, but I cannot understand it." "Oh no, Miss, I don't thinlk that. I don't think all do, but I'm afraid some wicked people do. They act as though they did, certainly, doing all the mischief they can. But we don't really love God before we have had a change of heart; we don't really feel that I He is our Father, ready to sanctify and save us by his grace."   132      STEP BY STEP,--OR, "That's the odds, gran'marm," said Mr. Carter. "Seems to me I never hated God in my hardest days, and I all'us felt a kinder respect for good folks above bad uns, but as to lovin' Him anyways as my little uns love me, why that I didn't. I reckon tant possi- ble to love anybody we don't know much about; least ways I couldn't." "It's very difficult," said Delia with a sigh, " to feel that nearness to God, which you seem to have at- tained, Mrs. Rawson; I wish I could." "God gives in full measure to them that ask him; you don't doubt that?" said Mrs. Rawson. "No, surely I don't doubt it, but I don't know how it is. I fear I believe with the understanding rather than with the heart." "The offering of a young heart is well pleasing unto the Lord. If we would serve Him aright, we shall not withhold from Him what is His own." "The same lessons, the same loving reproofs meet me here as at your mother's," said Delia to Helen, when after a few more minutes' conversation with Mrs. Rawson, they were walking home,- "I see the exceeding power and beauty of such faith and such holiness; yet I have no experiences myself of such. My reason approves, while my heart does not feel. Can you tell me," asked she, abruptly, without wait- ing for Helen to reply to her remark, "why Mrs. Rawson appears so superior to her situation, and to her son-in-law? She expresses herself well, and has an air of refinement quite unusual in her station." "Mother says," replied Helen, " that she lived with an uncle of hers in her young days as a nursery maid, and had the best opportunities there for improving herself by reading good books; and another reason,   DELIA ARLINGTON.-      133 mother says, is, she reads the Bible so much. Mother says no one can be in the habit of reading the Bible daily, as Mrs. Rawson does, and making its precepts rules of action, without being softened and elevated by it. She says, she has often been struck by the change religion has wrought in the coarsest and rudest people; and there is nothing like true piety to malie people refined and polite." "I remembers said Delia, i once seeing a defini. tion of politeness as 'kindness kindly expressed.' Of course, we all should be truly polite in that sense of the word, if we only loved our neighbor as our- selves, which we should do if we were true Chris. tians." Here the two girls parted company, and each pur- sued her way homeward, deeply absorbed in thinking of what they had seen and heard in that home of poverty and suffering they had been visiting; and each m1ore profoundly impressed than ever with the excellency and power of the Christianl faith. Thus was the process of their own religious culture going on, in the way of God's appointment, and in due time its blessed results shall be seen. At home, matters remained with Delia very much as at first. Her aunt was- kind, but scarcely affec- tionate; the Judge distant and haughty; Maria su- percilious and disdainful; Fred and Clara taunting or indifferent. But she delighted in little Herbert's society, and strove, as best she could under the cir- curmstances of her own deficiencies, to sow good seed in his mind, when, as it seemed to her, there were so many carelessly sowing tares. She delighted, too, to listen to Mary's graphic sketches of her life in the old country.  12   134      STEP BY STEP,---OR, Her really noble heart would throb with indigna- tion, as the simple-minded girl recounted the wrongs of Ireland, or warm with pleasure at her stories of true neighborly kindness which their many trials and hardships called forth. Delia admired the good quali- ties, while she saw the faults of that generous-hearted, impulsive people, as they were brought to view in Mary's simple recitals, and it perplexed, while it greatly pained her, that natural traits of character so noble should be so perverted by priestcraft and a misdirected education. Reading, of which she was very fond; writing to her uncle letters, which were the outpourings of her heart; and sewing for the Carters to assist the over- taxed Susan, filled up the measure of her home re- creations. Her most frequent visits were to Mrs. Temple's, although she liked more and more to go to Mrs. Lawton's, as she became better acquainted with that lady, who, she found was no less a beautiful ex- ample of the truly Christian woman, than was Mrs. Temple or Mrs. Rawson, only on -account of natural temperament, perhaps, she was less disposed to con- verse with others upon the deeper and most sacred experiences of her heart. Adie- Lawton often came to see her, frequently spending hours in her room. One day when she came, she found her busy finishing off a coarse frock for little Nancy Carter. "My stars, Delia, what a taste you have, to be sure, for fancy work," she said, as she took up one of, the sleeves and scanned it curiously. "What on earth possesses you to do such work?  "Oh, I do it because I like to," said Delia, laugh- ing, " and to help poor Susan Carter." AP-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      135 "You help her enough in other ways, I should think, or might, if you wanted to. Well, if fancy- work is the order of the day, give me a needle and let me sew on that canvas stuff to see how it seems. Dear, dear, I can't get the needle through. Heave ho, here it goes at last! Here, Herby, come and see what a pretty frock cousin Delia is making for you," she said, as Herbert came in at that moment. "Tant Herby's, Miss Adie knows tant, don't she, Dele. She's naughty to tell untrues." "Who told you it was naughty to tell untrues, Master Herby?" said Adie, catching him on her lap, for he was a great favorite with her. "Tozen Dele told me, and  Maly told me, and Mamma too. Sides Herby know  heself, its naughty." How does he know it heself?" "Herby do, dat's nuff," said he, pouting. "Well, kiss and be friends; I was only joliing." "Herby don't tink dat's prety jotin though; tozen -Dele don't do so." "Tozen Dele is always good, isn't she, Herby?" "No, she isn't: she's naughty too, sometimes. Herby seed her naughty once, and she say so. I b'leve her; but she's more dooder dan you, p'raps." "Why do you think so?" "Cos she is." "Reason good and true, brave little champion of. tozen Dele," said Adie, hugging him closer than ever. "You are as right as you can be about it. Will you be friends now if I promise not to laugh any more?" "Yes, Herby love Adie now."   136      STEP BY STEP, -OR, CHAPTER XIV. "The wildest ills that darken life, Are rapture to the bosom's strife; The tempest in its blackest form, Is beauty to the bosom's storm." J. W. EASTBURNE. "DELIA, will you go shopping with me this after- noon?" said Clara, in an unusually pleasant manner one Saturday morning in March. "I'm afraid I can't. I promised Helen I would certainly visit her this afternoon. This is one of her busy days, and she will not be able to get out herself." "Are you going to help her sew?" "Perhaps I shall, if there's anything that I can do. Sometimes I read aloud while she and her mother work." "What do you think that spiteful Mrs. Loomis says about you?" "I'm sure I don't know." "Well, she tells everywhere that you go to Mrs. Temple's to sew for money, your allowance is so small; and she wonders Judge Grafton should permit it'." "It is quite immaterial to me what Mrs. Loomis says" replied Delia, coloring high, however, at the same time. "Yes, to be sure, nobody ever believes her, she's so envious; but 'tis provoking to have her talk as she does. She said the other day to Maria, that every- body but she had their spring hats. She'd better let   DELIA ARLINGTON.     137 Maria alone, I can tell her, if she knows what's good for herself. She's not famous for paying her bills, so Maria looked up at her new lilac hat, and said, I never get articles of dress till I can pay for them, Mrs. Loomis. But come, be a good girl for once, Delia, and go with me, - I don't want Maria, and mother will let me go with you; she thinks you are so steady." "Why'don't you want Maria? She can advise you better than I can." "I don't want her advice, or dictation, you better say; she thinks I've no right to a taste of my own, and indeed that nobody has any taste at all but her- self. Besides, to tell you the truth, Delia, I don't wish her to know the principal thing I am going out for. I borrowed a bracelet of Elenor Thompson to wear to Ella Loomis's party the other night, and I was so unfortunate as to break the clasp, I wish to stop at R. S. & Co.'s to have it mended. If Maria goes with me she's so contrary, she'll makl a fuss about it, and I don't see any use of that now I've done the mischief." That was very true, Delia thought, knowing Maria's disposition as she did. "But," she answered, "I wonder you should ever borrow jewelry or anything out of the family." "' I never will again, if I can only get clear of this scrape. Mrs. Thompson would be mad enough if she knew it." "Then it certainly was not right for you to borrow of Elenor." "Oh dear, I know it; but don't bother me with right and wrongs now, for mercy's sake. If you'll go with me this afternoon, we'll have the carriage early 12\   138     STEP BY STEP--OR- enough for us to do the errands, and for you to make your visit to Helen, while I carry the bracelet to Elenor?" "The carriage?" said Delia. "Yes, father lets me have the old one and Thomas to drive, any Saturday afternoon I want it. Say yes, do." "' Yes it is, then, if you will go in season to give me an hour or two with Helen." "Agreed, but don't let on to Maria that we are going together." "She's not very likely to question me about my movements," replied Delia. Maria was not likely to trouble herself about them in any way, since she was in her own room absorbed in the last new novel. The day was cloudy, threat- ening rain, and not sufficiently tempting to induce her to appear out in her new spring hat and mantilla. Accordingly, at the appointed hour, the girls set off, unquestioned by her, on their expedition; Mrs. Graf- ton sending by them some trifling directions to her milliner about a cap she wished sent home that night. Their first call was at- the milliner's, where Clara delayed so long, expatiating upon the sweet- hats, charming flowers, splendid ribbons, loves of wreaths, exhausting all the fashionable superlatives of admirar tion, that, Delia was obliged to remind her several times it was growing late, before she could be drawn away from them. Their next destination was the - splendid jewelry establishment of R. S. & Co. Here, while Clara was delivering her errand to one of the clerks, Delia amused herself in looking at the rich and elegant articles displayed for sale at a different coun- ter, Her surprise, however, would have greatly ex-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      139 ceeded her pleasure, had she known that her cousin purposely directed her attention to that part of the store, that she might give the bracelet to be repaired in her name. In a short time the clerk was seen approaching, with the box containing the mended bracelet in his hand. Clara took out her portmonnaie and opened it, and starting back in apparent dismay, exclaimed: "I have left my money at home, all but a paltry shilling. Do pay for me, Delia." As she spoke she hastily retreated to the other part of the store, without giving Delia opportunity to re- ply, just as the young man came up. He handed the bracelet to her; she took it mechanically, paid for'it, and passed it to Clara as they left the store to- gether. " Why did you leave me to settle your bill?" in- quired Delia, as they went to their carriage. "You ran away as if you thought I should refuse to lend you the money." "Oh   dear, I didn't know what I did, I was so frightened when I  found I hadn't any money. I wouldn't have had it charged for the world." Clara did not think it necessary to add, that, it was all not only a preconcerted plan on her part, but, that at the moment the bracelet was brought back, she saw her father in another part of the store eyeing their proceedings, and she wished him to see that Delia received the bracelet, supposing in that case, no inquiries would be made. "It rains in torrents, Delia; you'd better give up your visit to Helen this afternoon, and go with me to Elenor's, and then home as fast as we can." ' No, indeed! don't ask me, Clara. Leave me at   "O      STEP. BY STEP -- OR) Mrs. Temple's door, and I shall get home very well. There is a carriage stand near." Mrs. Grafton had not deemed it necessary to in- form Delia of the Judge's prohibition respecting the carriage, being very sure she would never ask for it. Clara knew of it, however; but just -now she really felt grateful to Delia for so kindly obliging her, and, with the ready sophistry of a disingenuous mind, said to herself, " father didn't tell me anything about it, so I needn't know he forbade it; and if he-makes any inquiries, Delia will be sure to tell him she asked to be left, and I shall come off scot free at any rate." Delia passed a very pleasant hour at Mrs. Temple's. When she set out on her return the rain had abated, and she did not, as she had intended, take a carriage. But before she reached Broadway, it began to pour again as if the very flood-gates of heaven were opened. She sought shelter in a store, the first she could enter, with the intention of asking one of the clerks to call a carriage for her, but encountering a stare of impertinent curiosity from the young men, her courage failed her, and she saw she must take her chance of finding one herself. Every cab or carriage that passed, however, was either already filled, or driven at such a furious rate, that she could not hail them. In the meantime one of the young men of the store come near, and by his insolent manners showed a disposition to take advantage of her unprotected situation, for sport for himself and fellow clerks. She was so much annoyed that she rushed out into the rain again, and beckoned to the first omnibus that came along to take her up. To her dismay she found it filled with gentlemen, and among them sat in   DELIA ARLINGTON.      141 awful state, as she-thought, Judge Grafton. There was nothing to be done, however, but quietly take the seat offered her near the door by a young man, and drawing her veil more closely over her face she sat down, uncertain whether the Judge recognized her or not.- But nothing ever escaped his lynx-eyed observation that, in any way related to the rules of his household, which, like the laws of the Medes and Per- sians, were unalterable. When the omnibus stopped at the corner of the street, whence a few steps would take her home, she paid her fare and hastened away as rapidly as she could without actually running. As she stood at the door in an agony of impatience, waiting Taylor's tardy answer to the bell, (for he never hurried himself,) she saw the object of her dread approaching, safe un- der the protection of an umbrella, in his usual slow and dignified manner. As soon as the door opened to receive her, she ran into the hall and up two flights of stairs to her own room -without pausing. She was dripping with wet, and notwithstanding her excite- ment, chilly, exhausted and suffering from a severe headache. On the landing by her own door she en- countered Clara, who was evidently -waiting for her. "Bless me, Delia," she said, "you look like a drowned rat and like a ghost too!" and, following her into her room, she added, as Delia took off her hat and shawl, and disclosed a pale, anxious face, "How did you get home in such a plight?" Delia recounted her adventures, and finished by saying: "Your father was in the omnibus." - "My gracious, Delia, what did he say?" "Nothing at all; I am not sure that he'knew me."  "   "2     STEP BY STEP,--OR, "Oh, yes he did; he knows everything that nobody wants him to, and he will ask all sorts of questions about our being out. Pray, Delia, don't tell him about the bracelet; that is, don't tell him I had any- thing to do with it; he'll be so angry."*t "Why should I tell him? Of course I shall not." "Because, - because, - he may ask. He was in the store and saw you pay for it, and he thinks it is yours, I suppose. Oh do, do let him think so. If you only knew how angry he would be with me if he knew all about it, you would not hesitate. Indeed, indeed," said she, bursting into tears, as Delia stood silent, transfixed with amazement, "I do not know what to do. If it had not been for this unlucky om- nibus ride, I don't think he would have said a word about it; now he will ask all sorts of questions. If he finds out that I borrowed from Elenor, he'll never forgive me; he never allows us to borrow anything from anybody, and he hates the Thompsons, and only lets us visit them because Mrs. Thompson is so much the fashion." "Why did you not tell me all this before? You didn't say a word about fearing your father's anger this morning, or this afternoon either." "Because you're so notional and so particular, I thought you wouldn't go with me if I did." "I don't see how I can help you, Clara, or what there is for you to do but tell your father the exact truth. If he questions me, of course I must tell him the truth. I warned you long ago never to expect me to be a party to any deception; there is nothing I despise so much. Pardon me, Clara, my plain speak- ing; but I was educated to regard falsehood or de- ception in any form a deadly sin, and my whole nature revolts against it." /   DELIA ARLINGTON.      143 "But you said one day that we could be truthful ourselves without implicating others, and that you did not think it right to betray confidences." "Under certain circumstances I said we could; I do not know whether it will be possible in this case. I certainly do not wish to betray your confidence." "Oh, Delia, be my friend this time; do not betray me. You never would ask me to tell my father, if you only knew how angry he would be with me, and, indeed, it is not my fault that I dare not tell him the truth.  He is just as angry and just as unforgiving if we confess everything, as he would be if we told a dozen falsehoods about it. I used to tell the truth when I was little, but now I think it is easier for me to deceive than to be open. I am sure it is for Fred; he don't mind doing anything to keep father from knowing what he has been about; and mother is afraid of father too when he's angry, and she helps us deceive him sometimes; she's so afraid of what he will do to us."  Delia was so strongly persuaded that it was indeed as much the fault of the despotic father and the weak mother, that Clara was so deceitful, she relented somewhat in her first purpose. "I  will do what I can for you, Clara, if I am ques- tioned, all I  can without telling an untruth; that I will never do for any one. I would not do it for my- self, and I will not do it for any one else. But let me tell you now for theI last time, never entangle me in anything of the kind again." So saying Delia turned away to finish her toilet for dinner, and Clara, seeing she could obtain nothing farther, left her to herself. She was late as it was. With a beating heart, and aching head, and flushed   "4      STEP BY STEP,- OR cheeks, she descended to the dining-room after all the other members of the family were seated. It was an unsocial and an uncomfortable meal. Such meals were not uncommon in that house of luxury. When the master himself was not in an agreeable mood, all seemed hushed to silence as if by tacit consent; for it was very evident, he never wished any one to ap- pear so independent of himself as to dare to converse when he chose to be silent. Delia had often felt at this table (but never more forcibly than this day, when contrasting the moral atmosphere around her with that at -Mrs. Temple's) the truth of the proverb,--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith." Towards herself particularly the Judge preserved an ominous silence, which she felt was but the lull of the elements before the bursting forth of the hurricane. Contrary to his usual custom, he rose from the table when the ladies did, and requested the favor of a few minutes' conversation with Miss Ar- lington in his library. Mrs. Grafton looked inquiringly, but received no enlightenment from her husband; Maria supremely indifferent; and Fred and Clara, who from experience knew too well what such a summons portended, exchanged glances, in which the half triumphant ex- pression of the brother contrasted strangely with the terrified one of the sister, who turned absolutely pale. ,S She'll catch it now, (Clara, I'll bet a guinea. What's to pay? Been transgressing, eh? Can't stand the governor's decrees, eh? I thought so. But what's the matter with you? Any affair of yours?" "Do hold your tongue, Fred, and let me go;" answered Clara, at the same time rushing past him.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      145 "Well, it's no business of mine, luckily," he mut- tered to himself. " By Jove, though, I should like to see how she'll stand fire. She'll die game, I reckon ; the old man'll1 find her a tough customer, I'm think- ing, gad!" Delia felt as she followed Judge Grafton, that she was summoned as a culprit to the bar, and this feel- ing at once aroused all her pride and resentment, con- sequently her step was as haughty and determined as his. With a condescending wave of the hand, he motioned her to a seat, as they entered the library, and commenced: "I have requested your presence here, Miss Arling- ton, in order to make a few inquiries of you, to which your! position as a member of my family entitles me to expect direct answers." I UYou shall have them, sir, if it is in my power to give them." "No subterfuges, if you please, Miss Arlington; they will not serve you with one so intimately ac- quainted as myself with the workings of the human heart. Your power to answer is, of course, limited only (allow me to say it) by your somewhat imperious wills" To this remark, Delia made no reply, although the Judge paused as if in expectation of one. "Did I see you this afternoon," he then continued, "in the store of Messrs R. S. & Co.? 9 "I was there, sir." "For what object, may I inquire?" "For no object, sir, in which I had any personal interest. I hope you will be satisfied with this an- swer, and not question me farther." "Ahem! highly satisfactory! In this event, then, I   "6      STEP BY STEP, --OR, shall consider myself at liberty to form my own con- clusions in the premises; which are, that Miss Arling- ton, despite her boasted philanthropy, and pretended indifference to fashion, is not superior to the rest of her sex in admiring- and purchasing expensive jew- elry, although hardly suited to her present style of dress, and somewhat limited allowance." Delia remained silent, not daring to trust her indig- nant voice to reply to so direct a doubt of her word. Of course with Judge Grafton's preconceived opin- ion of the matter, he could draw but one inference from her manner, which was, that she had not only purchased the elegant bracelet, of which he had a glimpse, as the clerk passed him with the open box, but that she was also guilty of evasion in regard to it. No suspicion of Clara for a single instant crossed his mind, since to suspect her would be a reflection on the wisdom of his system of family government. And for Judge Grafton to doubt his own wisdom in mny matter whatever, would have been an event scarcely less remarkable than for him to have attached no importance to the position Judge Grafton held in the highest circles of fashion in the city of New York. He continued: "May I ask where you went after leaving the jeweller's?" "To Mrs. Temple's, sir?" "In my carriage?" "Certainly, sir; it rained very hard. Clara was going to visit a schoolmate, and I asked her to leave me at Mrs. Temple's door." "Were you not aware, that I had prohibited your ever going to Mrs. Temple's in mny carriage; and that I altogether disapprove of the acquaintance for a member of lmy family?"   DELIA ARLIN0TON.      147 "Indeed, sir, I was not aware of any such prohibi- tion, and under the circumstances, I should not have supposed such an one would be laid on the most humble member of your family. With regard to the acquaintance, I understood from my aunt that my visits at Mrs. Temple's had your consent at least," replied Delia, in a tone in which she but poorly suc- ceeded in suppressing her indignation. "I have one more question to ask, before closing this interview with a few words of salutary counsel]" he continued, in a tone a little less arrogant than before. In truth, he already began to feel that the contest was an unequal one, and, although, on his own side he had all the advantage arising from age, position, and authority; all these were more than counterbal- anced by the resolution which her own lofty integrity of purpose and singleness of heart gave to the young girl before him. "Did you not know, that I consider it vulgar for ladies, holding the position in society that members of my family do, to ride in so public and common a conveyance as an omnibus?" "I did, sir, but as there was no alternative for me between that on the one hand, and insult or exposure to a drenching rain on the other, I did not, for an instant, suppose you could make any objection." She then informed him in a few words of her fruit. less endeavors to call a carriage, and of the insolent behavior of one of the clerks in'the store, in which she had taken refuge. He shook his head distrustfully.  "Carriages are to be had at all hours and plapes in a city like this, Miss Arlington, with a very little effort, even in such   "8      STEP BY STEP, OR, weather as we have had to-day. Your favorite plea of economy cannot avail you here, since a young lady who indulges herself so largely in jewelry, can scarcely with consistency urge that as a reason for disregard- ing known regulations. If your father, in his eccen- tric defiance of the world's opinions countenanced such proceedings, I cannot, and," pausing -- , I shall not." Delia's indignation had been waxing hotter and hotter at his arrogant manner and almost insulting language; and now at his implied doubt of her word and reflection upon her father, it burst all bounds and flamed forth in look and tone, as she rose from her seat and replied to him. "Judge Grafton, I am not so lost to all natural feeling, as quietly to hear my revered father insult- ingly spoken of. For all that is good in me I am indebted to his instructions and example, while to you, sir, I can only say, that no human being ever yet called into action within me such evil passions as you have done, -by the manner in which you have treated me, whenever I have been so unfortunate as to displease you. Why you treat an orphan,-but happily, sir, not altogether an unprotected one, while my Uncle Edward lives, -in this manner, I know not. I have only to repeat, that my statements, one and all, are correct; that I have told you the truth, and nothing but the truth; that I am no such hypocrite or liar, or mean recipient of unwilling favors, as your accusations represent me to be; and that I do not know any right you have, first to insult and then to advise me. I will wait, sir, till a more convenient season for the few words of salutary counsel you intended for my benefit."   DELIA ARLINGTON.       149 So saying, Delia turned and left the room, every vein filled almost to bursting with the hot blood which coursed rapidly through them, and her heart a perfect tumult of passion, frightful even to herself. Her own room gained, she paced backward and forth' in a fury of conflicting feelings, in which indignation and anger, and the keen reproaches of conscience by turns strove for the mastery. At length, however, conscience gained the victory, as she ever does in noble natures. The poor girl threw herself on her bed, and wept bitter tears of re- pentance, that she had so entirely departed from her good resolutions, and had so little real strength of purpose as to allow herself in such a tempest of un- becoming rage. However great and whatever the provocation might be, she felt there was no excuse for her. "Love your enemies " (just now she could think of Judge Grafton in no other light); , do good to them that persecute you; love them that hate you; bless and curse not." These and kindred texts of Scripture seemed the hand-writing on the wall to her self-accusing spirit, as she reviewed her conduct. "Shall I never, never govern this terrible temper of mine?" she said to herself. "What good does it do me to be with Mrs, Temple and Helen, if I cannot profit better by their example, and if I cannot catch a particle of their living faith, that faith which enables them to bear calmly insults and injuries, which would arouse in me all the evil passions of mny nature? But I understand it all; they do all things through Christ. who strengtheneth them. I have not that strength, and my own, on which I had so prided myself, is weakness indeed.'" !s*   150      STEP BY STEP, -- OR, At this moment Clara knocked at the door, and begged so earnestly to be admitted, that Delia could- not refuse her. "What did father say? Did you tell him? Does he know?" were her hasty and broken inquiries. " I cannot tell you what he said, Clara; I have not informed against you, and he does not appear to sus- pect you; that is all I can say to-night." "Are you vexed with me, Delia? I am sorry." "No, no, I have no right to be vexed with any one but myself. I have: forfeited my own self-respect.' Good night, Clara. If your-mother asks for me, tell her I have a violent headache, and have gone to bed." Clara gone, she sat disconsolately down to think over again her interview with Judge Grafton. The more she reflected upon it, the more evident did it appear to her that she had been hasty in her language and abrupt in her manners towards him, and it was her duty to make an apology. Accordingly she wrote him a note to that effect, which she immediately des- patched by Mary. This done, she determined to write to her uncle the next day, and tell him the whole affair, and request him to take her away, as she felt unequal to the task of governing herself in her present situation; for while she could not look for aid to any member of her aunt's family, she had not yet learned to seek it from its only true source. This resolution she carried into effect the -next day, although too unwell for the effort. The cold she had taken, added to violent mental excitement, working on her delicate constitution, se- riously affected her health. She was unable to attend church, or indeed to leave her room. The dav fol- lowing she went down stairs, but looked pale and   DELIA ARLINGTON.   -   151 languid, and had little or no appetite. Tuesday she Went to school again, but evidently the exertion was too much for her. She continued in this state for the remainder of the week, her countenance bearing as evident marks of mental as of physical suffering. The Judge regarded her quite complacently, think- ing she was truly penitent for the outrage upon his dignity; Maria voted her sulky; Mrs. Grafton and Clara were really uneasy about her; Fred said " she 'hadn't the mettle he expected for all her fine airs, and little Herbert privately whispered to Mary, that " he touldn't bear to see tozen Dele solly all time." On  Saturday, Delia received a reply from her uncle, deeply affectionate and kind, but urging her to school herself to the determination of remaining in Judge Grafton's family for the year, in compliance with her father's wishes. The tender counsels and true love apparent in every line touched her heart, and greatly aided her in seeing the path of duty. After this she went down into the drawing-room in search of a book, and feeling faint and sick, lay down upon the couch. A short time after, one of the servants coming in and finding her there insensible, carried her to her own  room. Mrs. Grafton  was hastily sum- moned, and the family physician called. -    * -   CHAPTER. XV. "We watched her breathing through the night,  Her breathing soft and low, As on her breast the wave of life Kept heaving to and fro."  HOOD. THE doctor came, and after examining his patient, and making inquiries with respect to her recent state of health, shook his head doubtfully. He pronounced her symptoms those of the typhoid fever, aggravated, he thought, by some mental trouble or excitement, consequently her case was one that required the most careful and judicious treatment. Judge Grafton, like many others who live as if this present world was their only abiding place, had a great dread of sickness and death. He was particu- larly fearful of ally disease, that might be considered contagious or epidemic. Consequently, he forbade his daughters' going to Delia in her present condition, and imposed many restrictions upon his wife, as to the precautions she should take in her occasional visits to the sick room, insisting that a nurse should be immediately procured for her. Thus while she lay sick nigh unto death, in her re- mote apartment, unattended, and apparently forl the most part uncared for, save by her kind and watchful nurse, everything went on very much as usual with the other members of the family. The fever raged frightfully, and the delirious wan- derings of the poor sufferer were at times fearful to listen to, as she tossed from side to side on her bed, scarcely getting a single hour's quiet sleep or rest for h   DELIA ARLINGTON.      153 days. As her disease progressed, the doctor informed Mrs. Grafton that her niece was very sick, and it was quite doubtful to him what the result would be when the crisis came; indeed that he thought the chances of her recovery small; and suggested that no time should be lost in acquainting her uncle with her condition. Mr. Howard was accordingly written to, and he arrived in New York early in the second week of his niece's sickness. He took lodgings near Judge Graf- ton's residence, and day and night, with only such intervals as needed rest demanded, found him watch- ing over the unconscious patient, whom he loved with almost a parent's intense affection; or within call in a dressing-room adjoining her apartment. His heart sank within him as he heard her in her agonized rav- ings call upon her father and himself to come to her. But painful and distressing as it was to him to wit- ness her mental sufferings, and the ravages which disease had made on her physical frame, life all this time was a blank to her. She knew not where she was, nor who was watching over her. During all these terrible days she never, by word or look, gave any intimation that she recognized the familiar voice which spoke to her so soothingly; and, it is to be hoped, that she was equally insensible to the suffer- ings which came so nigh taking her life away. At last, after painful days of watching and anxiety, there were indications of a change in her disease, but whether it would be to-life or death was very doubt- ful. When her consciousness returned she looked wildly- around, and seemed unable to comprehend where she was or what had happened, and appeared like one bewildered. As she caught sight of her   154      sTEP BY STEP,--OR, uncle, she seemed somewhat reassured, and murmuring faintly, "Home, Buffalo," closed her eyes in weariness. For days after her life hung upon a thread so frail, that it seemed as if the slightest breath of accident would sever it. Gradually, however, her symptoms improved, and although for many days she seemed so feeble that she could only speak a few words in a whisper, and could neither turn herself in bed, nor raise her head, the Doctor pronounced her gaining. "Physically, at least, she is gaining, or rather she has been up to the present time," said the Doctor in an- swer to an inquiry of Mr. Howard; " but I cannot do much more for her, unless you are able to assist nme by acting cheerfully upon her mind. A wretched place this, to, be sure, for a sensitive young creature like her to recover a healthy tone of mind," he added, shrugging his shoulders. "She's not in her element here. I knew that, long before I saw or heard all I have in this sick room. The way she has run on about the Judge has been anything but complimen- tary to him. However, sir, as I was saying, you must rouse her some how or other, or she'll loose all she has gained. This must be your work. It is not my province to ' minister to a mind diseased.' She's out of tune. Strike the true notes and bring her into harmony again. You should know how to do it." But Mr Howard did not know "how to do it;" kind and womanly almost, in some respects, as his nature was. But as Delia lay there day after day on her sick bed, so pale and languid, apparently caring for nothing but his presence, unwilling or perhaps unable to converse even with him, he saw that an effort must be made to arouse --her, or she would dream her life away in that torpid state. He felt   bDELIA ARLINGTON.      155 that the task of doing this devolved on him, and he set himself o the accomplishment of it. One bright morning in April he entered her apart- ment, bringing with him a beautiful bouquet ofSpring flowers, which he had purchased in the market. A smile of genuine pleasure lighted up her wan face as she took them in her hand, and thanked him for his thoughtful klindness. "And how much longer is my little laggard going to waste the fragrance of her life on the desert air of this third story room?" he inquired playfully. "See, I have brought you these little monitors to tell you to be up and doing, even as they are, diffusing per- fume and gladness wherever they are borne. Will you heed them, idle one?" Delia shook her head mournfully. "I cannot, uncle. Oh, why did I ever get well?" "Well you are not, my child, or you would never forget all the causes of thanksgiving you have, and indulge in this morbid state of mind. As it is with the flowers, so it should be with you. Shall we re. ceive good from the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil? My experience, Delia, tells me that clouds and storms are as essential to the Christians growth, as to that of the soulless flower which de- lights your senses. To quote your favorite poet, ' Be still, sad heart, and cease repining; 'Behind the  louds is the sun still shining. ' Is there no sun  of righteousness, my dear child, to gladden the waste and desolate plaes of your "Now  there seems to be no sun, nor moon, nor stars, for me, uncle. All, all is darkness; gloom with- out and hopelessness within."   156     STEP BY STEP,--OR, " And will be that, and, indeed, worse than that, if you lie here forever," said -he, resuming his former playful tone. , Do you think I can leave my 'wedded wife' much longer, to dance attendance upon the vagaries of a sick girl? No! She is now calling me back to her quiet companionship, and I must soon answer to her in person. I give you one week more of my society, and then I must go." "Oh, no, no! Unless you'll take me with you." "That cannot be at present; but if you will be a good girl and sit up this very day, and see how well you can behave yourself, and to-morrow, if it is pleasant, let me drive you out, I will promise not to leave you without finding some good fairy to come and nurse you into better health and spirits than I can do." "Who?" ' Your friend, Mrs. Temple, perhaps." "But she cannot come; she wouldn't like to." "I'll see about that. I know how to manage it, I think. I must leave you now for a little while. When I come back I will take lunch with you at that little table. Let me find you up and waiting for me." As the'door closed on her uncle, Delia sank back exhausted on her pillow. She was really very weak, and felt utterly unable to make the exertion required of her; but she knew there must be a first time to every effort, and determined with some of her natural firmness of character, to comply with her uncle's wishes. Accordingly when he returned he found her seated in an arm-chair by the window, attired in a loose robe of pale blue, with a pretty muslin cap shading her fair, young, but, alas, sadly changed face.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      17 She looked so etherial, so fragile, that he was unable at firstto address her in a playful manner. "Well, Delia," said he presently, taking a chai b hride, o, the-Dmorrw has given me permission to driveyou out to-morrow, if the day is fine." "To-morrow, Uncle Edward?, " "Yes, my little convalescent, to-morrow. And why not to-morrow? , "Oh dear, I can never walk down stairs." "Can never walk down stairs! Well suppose h cannot. Are there not strong hands and willing hearts to help you? Mrs. Blackstone, your nurse, and I can carry you down. But if our strength fails, you've grown so stout of late, perhaps your friend Taylor down below will condescend to give you the benefit of his assistance.,  "Oh, uncle!" said Delia smiling. As you think I have a plan to propose for your consideration, Delia. Doctor West this morning told me he th ought your health needed a change of air. I have since had a  talk with your aunt with regard to it. She suggested that you go up to Judge Graffon's country house on the Hudson, which is kept open through the year, if a suitable person can be foundcto go with you. I named Mrs. Temple, to whom she made no objection. She says the famil never go up until June so you will have ample time to recruit, be- fore the bustle of their removal takes place. Does the Plan meet your approval?, Wiyes, indeed it does, uncle, if Mrs. Temple will see her about it to-day."

But now its wounds are healed again; Gone are the anguish, the terror, and pain; For across that desolate land of woe, O'er whose burning sands I was forced to go, A wind from heaven began to blow; And all my being trembled and shook, As the leaves of the tree or the grass of the field, And I was healed, as the sick are healed When fanned by the leaves of the Holy Book!" LONGFELLOW. MR. HOWARD went to see Mrs. Temple according to his intention. The errand was by no means an agreeable one to him. Of late years he had had so little intercourse with society, that he shrank from any encounter with strangers; and no motive less7- powerful than his interest in his niece, could now have induced him to take such a step. Consequently it was with a nervous, trembling hand, that he :rang the bell at her lodgings, and inquired of the servant, who opened the door, if Mrs. Temple was in.   Being answered in the affirmative, he ascended the stairs, and found himself in the little parlor, where Mrs. Temple sat as usual sewing.  As she rose to greet the stranger, Mr. Howard stood as if fixed immovably to the spot, his breast heaving with evident emotion, while Mrs. Temple, on her part, although outwardly calmer, exhibited equal agitation in the almost death- ly pallor of her face. "Alice, is it possible?" at last faltered out the half   160     STEP BY STEP,--OR, bewildered man, " do I find you here and thus, after these long, long years of separation? Oh, my God, my punishment is greater than I can bear! But for my wayward folly and blind arrogant self-love, this had never been. Did you then lose all confidence in the friend of your youth, that you have not suffered him to aid you in your extremity?"  "Nay, not extremity, Mr. Howard," said Mrs. Temple, advancing and extending a hand which was warmly grasped. "I have many of the comforts and many of the blessings of life. Neither I nor my chil- dren have ever suffered--for bread," she added, see- ing her visitor glance doubtingly around the room," and if the cup of my experience has been one of mingled joy and sorrow, is it not the lot of all? Has it not been your lot, my friend?" "' Oh, yes, yes, that it has ; and I needed the disci- -pline, and I bowed at last to kiss the rod that chas- tened me in mercy and love. But you, you surely did not need such trials; you, whose character was so perfect, and whose purity of heart and life was ever such a reproach to those around you." "God sees not as man seeth," replied Mrs. Temple, humbly. "He knoweth how frail we are, and what discipline we need; very mercifully hath He dealt with me; not according to my-transgressions, but ac- cording to His infinite love and boundless mercy." "How many years it has been since I have heard of you in any way! While you remained in this State, I occasionally had tidings of you.

But her Mrs. Temple was the widow of a clergyman and I had aever heard either of your husband's change of profession or of his death. Are you willing to relate to me the his. tory of the past?

I told him all, and we were married. As his religious char- acter gained in strength, he became more and more desirous of devoting to his master's service, the gifts and eloquence of which, as a lawyer, he had a large share, and of spending the remainder of his days in winning souls to the Redeemer. This desire became so strong, that after a' short residence at L , we removed into the immediate vicinity of Boston, in order that he might pursue a course of theological study, and enter the ministry. My husband had a small property, which he had accumulated as a lawyer. We lived very prudently on that while he was engaged in his studies. Immediately after he was approbated to preach, he received a call to settle over a flourishing society in the neighborhood. But, alas, for human wisdom ; all our long cherished hopes were prostrated in the very hour that we looked for their full consummation. He was not needed as a laborer in his Father's vineyard, where we all thought he was fitted to do so much good. A violent cold terminated in an attack of pleurisy and-lung fever, and after a short but distressing sickness, he was summoned home. It was a mysterious providence; I-" Mrs. Temple paused, overcome by her varied emo- tions, but soon recovering herself, she continued: "This was ten years since. I wished to take a school for young ladies, but I found I had not the necessary capital, especially as there seemed no good   DELIA ARLINGTON. opening for suchwan undertaking where I was ac- quainted. I wrote to my uncle in Troy; I did it on account of my children, for I knew he had never for- given my maaniade . He advised me to come to that city, and offered me a cottage on his estate free of rent, and a small annuity besides. I immediately re moved there, and by giving lessons in music, lived very comfortably on my  income. This continued three years, when ny uncle married a foolish young girl, who seemed from the first to be greatly annoyed at our neighborhood to them. It was through her influence, I presume, that he advised me to come to this city and do ornamental work, in which he knew I had considerable skill. I did so. "Such is a brief outline of my history during my wedded and widowed life. It is trifling in the trials recorded in it, I am sure, compared with. that of many, a widow left in the sole charge of orphan children. The history of my heart's experienes in all this time I cannot lay before you even, true friend as I well know you to be." "Your uncle!" inquired Mr. Howard, with much emotion.

"Not too proud, certainly, but Melville will soon-be able to do all for us we need, I trust, and place us in a different position?"

DELIA ARLI NGTON.      165 After some further conversation, Mr. Howard made known to Mrs. Temple the errand, which had led to such an unexpected development. It needed only his representation of Delia's enfeebled state of health and morbid depression of spirits, to induce her to con- sent to accompany her to Judge Grafton's country seat. After leaving Mrs. Temple, Mr. Howard walked on the Battery some two hours, perfectly oblivious to everything around him, so absorbed was he in the emotions which his interview with this friend of his youth called forth. Passions and affections, which had slumbered through years of mental suffering, but had never been extinguished, awoke in,their full strength, and he found it no easy thing to quiet the troubled spirit which had been evoked within him. He thought of the sad and dreary past,- a past in a great measure of his own creation; so he felt, and contrasted it with what might have been. Well might lie feel as he often expressed himself, that he had been shipwrecked for time; for the ardent affec- tions and glowing emotions of his warm, generous, and manly heart, had too truly been wrecked on the sunken rocks of his self-sufficient presumption. True, his soul had at last found an anchor sure and stead- fast, and if even now the waters of life sometimes dashed rudely against him, they were more frequently calm, and he knew that he was safe, for he knew in whom he trusted. But now, now, - to have. stood face to face, - to have spoken again to the loved one of his early years, -her with whom he had fondly hoped to share life's joys and life's sorrows,-to have found her more lovely than ever, through the refining of trial and sor-   166      STEP BY STEP,--OR, row, was almost too much for his inward peace. If -he had never before done full justice to the Alice of his youth, he did it now, and if he never before had seen his own conduct in its true light, he saw it now. For a while the lonely man revelled in the past as it might have been. There came up before him a holy and beautiful vision of sacred family ties, - a true and loving heart entwined with his, glad voices and beaming happy faces of childhood's innocence, - a vision of a happy Christian family walking together the straight and narrow path, which leads to the golden gates of the New Jerusalem, where dwelleth God and the I;amb forevermore, their hearts only the more closely united in love and. tenderness by any cloud overshadowing them. He was aroused from this reverie by the rude jostling of a sailor, whose path he had abstractedly crossed, and brought back again to the reality of his condition as a lonely man, without wife or children, or happy Christian home to call his own,-and his heart sank within him and the strong man bowed his head in agony. But the spell passed away,--and there came to his spirit like the sweet chime of dis- tant bells, a faint murmur which seemed to say,-- ' Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou in God: for I1 shall yet praise Him for thei help of His counte- nance." The next morning, Mr. Howard took Delia out to ride, and had the gratification of seeing her look and appear decidedly better. - In the afternoon, Mrs. Temple and Helen came to see her, and their visit seemed to inspire her with new life. Indeed, cheer- ful and congenial companionship was her greatest   Is^gI DELIA ARLINGTON. 16' need.

Cultivate those   168      STEP BY STEP,--OR, feelings of cheerful trusting faith, my child, which will fit you for a never-ending life." "I fear I shall never succeed in properly cultivating those feelings, uncle. I feel, fanciful and ungrateful as it may seem to you, as if I was a frail bark on the ocean of time, alone and tempest-tossed, with no friendly eye from above watching over me, and no friendly arm outstretched to save me. The God, in whom I believe, seems to be sitting far off on His throne of glory and majesty, unapproachable to me; the Saviour in whom I should trust, seems to be a Saviour of the past and not of the present. As I read his teachings and the history of his life, they impress me as a beautiful vision of some former age. How much I should have rejoiced in him, had I then lived and listened to his words. .'How could he live and die for me centuries ago?" "It is the word of the Lord, for He hath spoken it. 'Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.' 'Jesus Christ is come into the world to save sinners.' If your Heav- enly Father careth for the birds of the air and the lilies of the field, careth He not much more for you?" "Sometimes I feel that He does, uncle; but I do not, I cannot feel so at all times." "Is it not because you do not go to Him in a right spirit, that He seems so unapproachable to you? Just now the feeble state of your health acts upon your mind, and consequently it may be that you see everything through a distorted medium. When you are well, you possess an active and inquiring mind, and a strong desire to trace effects to their causes, and search into those mysteries, that have been concealed from the foundation of the world. Is it not so?"   f, [- DELIA ARLINGTON.  169 "Yes, uncle." "Is there not also a little pride of intellect involved in all this; a feeling that you cannot readily adopt opinions accepted by the mass of mankind, many of whom are unlearned and in the lowly walks of life?" Perhaps so, I do not know,- if such is the case, I am scarcely aware of it. I have the highest respect for, and the utmost confidence in Ars. Rawson." "Yes, that may be, but she is above the average of her class, according to your account. I think it is more the case with you than you suppose.  Read 'your Bible. What teachings do you findthere Not surely thosethat encourage or warrant you in spend. ing the strength of your intellect, in seeking to fathom the mysteries of God's providence, but those rather which command you to go to Him as a little child in faith and love,-faith in Him as  a Father all-wise and all-powerful, and in Christ as Redeemer, --love to God and Christ and all mankind. Lay all your gifts and talents at the foot of the cross, my child, and You will be received and owned of the Lord. And your frail bark be tossed on that wild and stormy ocean upon which it has been launched, as not un-i likely it may be, you will be under the watchful care Of that eye which never slumbers nor sleeps, and you will be brought at last into the haven ofpeace and joy. Shall I  tell you how my bark was tossed on stormy waters in early youth, and how, though ship. wrecked for time, I was saved at last, and through the mercy of the All-seeing One, cast on the peaceful Waters  of the shoreless  ocean of Eternity?' "Oh do  , uncle, do." "I had not for intended to relate to you my earl history for many years yet, although, as I have on   170     STEP BY STEP,--OR, previous occasions intimated to you, I contemplated doing it at some future day; but circumstances with which you will soon be made acquainted, and your present state of rhind, have induced me to change my determination. Although you are scarcely more than a child in years, your maturity of character makes you seem to me almost a woman, and consequently, I speak to you with the greater confidence upon sub- jects, about which T should otherwise be silent. Lis-. ten then, and profit by an experience, which I cannot lay before you even without pain; and I would not do it, did I not feel that it may be of some service to you in your mental conflicts and doubts. "As a boy my health was delicate, and my mind very active. I was early distinguished, and often pointed out by my companions, as the boy who wanted to know the reason of everything. This was  all very well, so far as it regarded subjects which came within the limits of human knowledge; but as I grew to the age of youth and early manhood, I wished to penetrate the veil which shrouds Infinity from mortal understanding. The more I thought upon the mys- terious problems of life, the more I strove to solve them, until at last my mind became a perfect laby- rinth -of entangled ideas, and the early precepts and teachings of my pious mother were one by one almost entirely hidden from my memory. "In this restless, dissatisfied state of mind, I came to this city to study law, having completed my col- legiate course at Harvard University, in Massachu- setts. In the study of law, I obtained a new insight into life; and the developments of human folly and wickedness, which came under my observation from time to time, of course strengthened my previous I   I5      DELIA ARLINGTON.      171 O.    -171 opinions. Thus I gradually became skeptical upon matters of the highest and holiest concern to man- kind, although not avowedly so, even to myself. There was still a chamber in my soul, as subsequent events proved, into which the foul spirit ofunbelief did not enter, where were laid up and reserved for a holy use, the sacred lessons and impressions of my early religious training, but all else in my mind was chaotic darkness. "About this time I became acquainted with a young lady who, I soon felt, was to exercise no small influence over my future life. I shall not describe her to you. She was, she is, and she ever will be, my ideal of fenale worth, and purity and loveliness. She w as residin with a bachelor uncle, under the care of a maiden aunt, who had watched over her from in. fancy, she being an orphan. Our acquaintance soon ripened into intimacy, as her uncle encouraged my attentions to her, and made occasions to bring us into each other's society. But her aunt, who was not only a truly pious Christian, but, a woman gifted with a great deal of penetration, did not seem to be quite satisfied, and when at last I offered to Alice the love that had long been hers, this watchful guardian inter- posed objections to our immediate engagement. - Of course; as she was unable to give any definite reasons for so doing, and wre were ardently attached to each other, her objections were overruled. A short time subsequent to our engagement, some special business of the office in which I was studying, required me to go abroad. As my health was not yet very firm, my father advised  rme to improve the opportunity for travelling, and to protract my stay beyond the time required for the object of my visit. I did so, although    172      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, it was a trial to me to be parted so long from Alice; but the spirit of adventure and inquiry was strong within me, and I was absent nearly two years. 1"My wanderings once commenced, the. mania of unrest seemed to be upon me; and I embraced a wide field in my travels. I visited the ruins of ancient cities, and the splendid structures of modern ones. 1 saw the haughty despot and the proud noble revelling in luxury and splendor, and the degraded serf and -ab- ject peasant in their rags, wretchedness and filth. I saw the infantile follies and childish crimes of the new world grown to giant size; an hydra-headed monster in the old. I saw, too, saintly devotion, and sincere, if mistaken self-sacrifice and torture, that would put to shame the easy lives of our most rigid sectarians. My feet trod the snowy Alps, and wan- dered along the shores of classic Geneva. I stood on the burning side of Vesuvius, and traversed the de- serted streets of the buried cities. I walked among the wonders of Rome, and rested beneath the Pyra- mids, and floated dreamily on the Nile., I also visited the Holy Land, and followed 'in the paths of Him who spake as never man spake. I went to Jerusalem and recognized its familiar places, walked by the Sea of Galilee, and ascended the Mount of Olives. And much more,--more than I could relate to you in months,--I saw of the wonders of art and the beauty and sublimity of nature, and what think you was the result?" "To dispel your doubts, uncle, surely." "By no means. Like Pharaoh of old, I hardened my heart, and in my pride and folly said, ' there is no God.' Weak, presumptuous mortal that I was, I dared to arraign the Governor of the Universe, be-   DELIA ARLINGTON.  173 cause my finite comprehension could not understand nor fathom his laws. I said, if there be a God, a God of love and mercy, would sin and misery, vice and poverty, wrong and injustice, abound and have free course? Would a holy and righteous Being suffer the Hindoo mother to cast her first-born into the waters of the Ganges in -sacrifice to some false god, or permit the car of Juggernaut to roll over its deluded victims? In my arroganit pride, I answered no! and looked down with mingled feelings of pity and contempt upon humble and believing Christians. I trod the earth in scorn alike of its Maker and its inhabitants; or rather, I believed. it had no maker. Yes, Delia, this is a fearful history, aid one which I would fain have spared you, but that 1 feared you were already beginning to tread the same path which proved so fatal to me. See whither it led me, and ll avoid trusting in your own strength or your own intellect. "Something of my change of feeling was doubtless manifested in my letters to Alice, for when I returned home she received me sadly and tearfully. I knew her aunt had died three months previous, but that did not seem a sufficient cause for so great a depression of spirits upon the return of one, whom I knew she devotedly loved. After I had been at home a short time she told me her fears, and also that she had made a solemn promise to her aunt on her dying bed, that she would never marry an unbeliever; 'and, indeed, Edward,' she added, 'my own conscience for- bids it! ' Then, ' said I, scornfully, you do not hold to the doctrine that a believing wife can sanctify an Unbelieving husband? I should not dare,' she an- sweed to assume such a responsibility, -besides, I   17A      STEP BY STEP,-OR, have promised'"She then talked with me lpng and earnestly, and begged me as I valued her happiness and my. own eternal welfare, to give deep and prayer- fut-attention to the subject. 'r Alas, as I looked at her, as she -spoke, I hought more of her sweet, pleading face than of the holy truths she uttered. I would not beonvinced. As-I was preparing to answer, and, as I thought, at once overthrow all her sophistical warguments by my pow- erful, manly reasoningl she stoppedme and entreated me to write to her rather than to speak of what I had to say. 'Do not let the sound of your voice nor the glance of your eye, she said, 'be associated in my mind with the cwords I know you are about to tter. Our future relations, Edward, must depend on the treply you make to me. I only ask, you, to consider well what you say, before you pronounce the doom of separation between two hearts united as ours are. ' It is yourself who pronounce the doom' I said, an- grily, as I rose and left the room. "I went hone, sat down and penned a -passionate defence of my views, representing them in the darkest possible shades, as best fitted the state of nay mind. I ended thus, for I shall never forget a single word of that letter to the last day of my life' You have my answer, my beliefor unbelief,- whichever you may please to term it. It interferes not with, it abates not one single iotas my ardent love and devotion to you; on the contrary; it' increases it rather tenfold; since the love you waste upon the imaginary objects of your worship, I concentrate with almost an idola- trous fervor upon you. I pledge my word to you, that I will never interfere in any way whatever with the innocent delusions of your faith; and, if you will   DELIA ARLINGTON.      175 redeem your- plighted vow to be mine, I will-love and cherish you as woman has never yqt been loved and cherished by man.; for you are my 'all, my earth,: my heaven, my present, my future! But, Alice, I warn you if you discard me, and keep not the- solemn promise you have made, you will inevitably call down upon my head the vengeance of your God, if God there be; you will surely consign me to that pit where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched, if such a pit there be, for I shall have lost all faith in truth and virtue, as well as in God and heaven, and be utterly given over to despair.'" "Oh, uncle, how could-you?" "How could I? How can the murderer take the life-blood of the wife of his bosom, and the children of his love? How can many and many a mortal conmmit suicidal acts which sever them from the dear- est ties of earth? It is because they  are mad; be- cause they have not faith in anything good and- holy. I was mad, temporarily so at least, and I had no faith. J "Alice wrote me in reply the next day, The words of her, letter are burned into my heart; so loving, so tender, so compassionate, and ah, I understand it all now, so Christian. It was, of course, an entire dis- solution of our engagement on grounds which, she said, she was sure my reason would approve in my calmner moments; and she was right. "I could not,' she wrote, "I dare not retain a love so idolatrous as that which you profess for me. The very thought of taking the place in your heart which belongs to your Maker, is shocking, weak, frail, erring creature as I am. You seem to accuse me of un- faithfulness to the truth in not keeping my pledge,   176     STEP BY STEP,-- OR, with you. It is a very serious accusation. But I leave it to you to judge whether it be so, since to my faith and my deepest convictions, Edwa'rd, there is a Being, higher and holier than any mortal love, whom I must serve and obey first. I could never fulfil my most sacred duties to Him with a heart so devoted to one who even denies his existence. ' The innocent delusion' (could you not have spared me that, Edward?) is my only support in this hour of darkness; without it my weary feet would stumble, my sad heart would utterly fail; but with it I am  a strong, for my strength is of the Lord: and I bow in E submission to his chastenings. I pray for you and I ever shall, and if I shall live to know that my prayers have been answered, I shall feel that not in vain has descended on us this great trial. Edward, my Ed- ward never more, very dear wast thou unto me!' Thus she closed her letter, and this was the last wail of her almost broken heart." After a pause in which Delia seemed as much affected as her uncle, he resumed: "Alice's uncle was very angry with her for break- ing the engagement on such absurd grounds, as he styled them. I knew she- suffered persecution from him. "I returned to Buffalo in a state of mind bordering almost on distraction. The first effects of our broken engagement were very injurious to me; they served to increase my bitterness against all my fellow creatures, and to deepen my unbelief in God. After a time, however, my violent emotions exhausted their strength. I continued for many months in a state of apathy, from which I know not as I ever should have been aroused, had not my father's death obliged me to look   DELIA ARLINGTON.      1" after family affairs, and provide 'for myself a home. These matters attended to and settled, I entered upon my solitary life as a student, thinking to find in the pursuit of literature and science forgetfulness of, the past, if not positive peace. Your father and mother urged my living, with them; but I refused. In my arrogance and presumption I chose to be sufficient to myself. "But I was ill at ease. There was something within me ever crying give, give. Nothing satisfied me. There was ever a restless craving of my soul for somewhat which it had not yet found. I knew it was not wealth nor fame that I coveted. What was it, I often asked myself. By degrees; however, light began to dawn upon my benighted spirit, and I was able to see that my soul craved the very nour- ishment, which I in my pride and folly had denied to it. "One day, as in my state of unrest, I was ponder- ing the ways of my life, there came over me the sweet lullaby of my infancy, sung by my fondly loved,. and cherished mother, like the far-off melody of a spirit-- voice, recalling early, happy days, seemingly to soothe my wayward hours; a lullaby which first -taught me the Saviour's love. I then thought of my mother's instructions; of her. holy and blamelesslife; of her death so calm and peaceful; and her countenance as she lay in her burial robes bearing such an angelic expression, that I was unwilling to be taken from her. As I thought of all this and meditated long upon it, I asked myself, 'can all this have been delusion?' such faith, such peace, such a life, and such a death? Then my thoughts turned to Alice, the first and only love of my impassioned youth; and all her. gentle X /         * I   170      STEP BY T'I'E--O UK  virtues, and her strict devotion to principle and duty appeared to me in altogether a new light. She was right,' I said to myself. ' She was right.' I could do her justice then. And ah, how I reproached my- self for my blind folly and madness in casting from me such a treasure as her love. In this state of mind I took my Bible, andi I read, as I had never read be- fore, its wonderful lessons, and I pondered long over its mysterious pages. It contained a new revelation to me. Text upon text, precept upon precept, seemed actually to speak to my awakened soul, either in the thundering tones of terrible justice, or in the gentler notes of winning love. "A few months of study and prayer, and of wrest- lings with the old demon of doubt, and I was, I felt I was, a new man in Christ Jesus; I could say with the father who came to the Saviour with the demo- niac son, ' Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. You may ask how I knew I was accepted and for- given. I knew it because I felt it. I felt that the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and that he had freely given me of his grace according to the promise. I knew that I was forgiven, because my heart was at peace and trusting, and I was humble as a little child before my Maker. ( At this period I went to the home which had ever been open to me under your father's roof, and the aid which I received from his wise counsels, no less than from his truly Christian life was incalculable. Indeed what a rebuke to my previous blind folly was the character of that good man, who, though in intellect and attainments superior to most of his associates, was in humility and faith like a little child. "With this change wrought in my character, I saw j   DELIA ARLINGTON.      179 all my past presumption, and how hateful did it ap- pear to me. What, or who-was I, to think to fathom the Almighty's purposes, or to question the workings of his laws? I saw that if oppression and crime and iniquity abounded in the world, it could all be traced to the guilt and wickedness of man; and that while God might suffer such things to be for certain wise purposes, which indeed may be hidden from us, He is ruling over the world in wisdom and love, and that in that great doctrine of the Gospel of a life be- yond the grave, and the laws of retribution involved in it, provision has been made for the perfect ope- ration of the everlasting principles of right and justice. "Thus, my child, I became a believer again. I found a balm in Gilead for the hurt of my soul. When I applied to the true physician, he healed me. Nothwithstanding lonely and desolate have been the days of my pilgrimage; but I faint not even now, after so long a time, for I have the same strength to support me that supported Alice in our separation." "And, and-" "What, my child?" "Alice, as you call her, where is she?" "She married, three years after our engagement was dissolved, a man far more worthy of her than I could ever have been. But she was not able to give to him the full wealth of her affections; that, alas for her, had been wasted on me." "And now -" "She is a widow, and resides with her daughter in this city. She is one of the noblest of God's crea- tures still. You know her, Delia. Love her, for she is worthy of your love. Ask me no more."   180      STEP 'BY STEP,-ORa, O CHAPTER     XVII.          M "Warn them to wake at early dawn and sow Good seed before the world has sown-its tares."-  MRS. SIGOTRNEY.   GREAT was Delia's astonishment at her uncle's,  narration. Dearly as she loved him, and much as she - pitied him in his struggles and temptations, her sym- pathies all the time were with the Alice of his affec- tions, who, she was sure, must have suffered greatly  on his account; but when the revelation was made to her, that this beautiful character} whose steadfast- ness to principle raised her above ad selfish consider- i ations, and enabled her to offer, perhaps the most   pleasing because the greatest sacrifice a woman can  bring to the Lord, - her affections upon the altar of  duty,--when Delia learned that this lady was the very individual whom she cherished in her young imagination as the ideal of all that was pure andt Christian in woman, she was perfectly convinced, that she had not been mistaken in her estimate of Mrs. Temple.  She understood now why the ordinary     trials and disappointments of life appeared to affect that humble Christian so very slightly, being to her  like the winds that blow and the rains that beat upon the house which is founded on a rock. Her support  i was the Rock of Ages, and if, in early youth, she was able to resist the pleadings of her ardent affections, lest they should lead her away from Him in whom she trusted, whatever other trials might be laid upon her, had little power to affect her. Delia revered Mrs. Temple now more thanr she had   uDLiA AKLINGTON.      181 ever done before, and felt that she could look to her as a guide and example. She also was able to un- derstand many things in the character and habits of her uncle which hitherto seemed inconsistent. It had always appeared strange to her that with his generous and affectionate heart, his manner of life should have been so recluse and unsocial. Now this was a mystery no longer. She saw too, why it was, that her father had always treated him with such peculiar kindness and even tenderness. She could not but shudder as she thought of the fearful revela- tion he had made of his state of mind during the period in which he had withdrawn himself from the light of God's countenance, and she felt, moreover, that he but too truly understood her own danger; for she was conscious that in her search after truth, there had been mingled too much of the element of doubt, and all too little of childlike, trusting faith. And was hers a solitary case?  Are there not scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land, not only among the young, but also among professing Christians of all ages, thousands who are indeed, practical sceptics? Thousands who name the name of Christ, and have taken upon themselves the vows of discipleship; have done it too, in all sincer- ity and with a holy purpose, who are, nevertheless, continually questioning the Divine attributes, and even the Divine existence, and have scarcely no faith at all in an overruling Providence? To how many within the pale of the church, is Christ Jesus the Lord, a present, personal Saviour, compared with the number to whom   he has, practically, no existence whatever, save as a very good and exemplary man, who probably lived some eighteen hundred years ago   lc2      STEP BY STEP)--OR  in Judea, but with whom the present age has no other or different connection than with any other good man of those remote periods? If these things are so in this Christian land and within the Christian Church,-and who can doubt that they are to a greater or less extent,--what is the cause? If much of the. professed faith of the present age is not real faith, there must be gross fault somewhere. And is there no remedy for such a state of things? If Christ said, "Suffer the little children to come unto ne, and forbid therm not, for of such is the king- domn of God," is not that fact reason enough and evi- dence quite sufficient, that they in their innocence, that is, before they have learned to walk in the way of transgression, and in their loving faith, whatever may be their susceptibilities, are meet for that king- dom? And that, if they can be kept unspotted from the world, and brought up in the nurture and admo- nition of the Lord, and in the love and practice of the Christian graces and virtues, they never will deny the Saviour that bought them, even at the price of agony and blood? Who that has had aught to do with children, has not seen, by their sparkling eyes and beaming looks, how readily they are wrought upon by any simple recital of good deeds, and by kind and loving words; how their ardent sympathies respond to generous and lofty sentiments, and how easily the flame of a holy purpose is kindled up in their young hearts. With such natures and such susceptibilities, why should not the child that loves goodness rather than evil, (as surely every child does, whatever his practice may be,) be taught to love Christ, who is the embodiment of all goodness, as well as the full manifestation of the Father?    DELIA ARLINGTON. How is it with the young at-the present day, even in our most Christian communities? In many and many a pious home, without any' doubt, they are taught both by precept and example, the beauty of holiness and the nature of their relations to Christ the Saviour, and to God their Heavenly Father, and walk in the straight and narrow way which leadeth unto life. But how is it with them in many other homes: even nominally Christian homes? To what influences are they exposed there? Those which con- tribute to the highest and best cultivation of their moral natures? By what atmosphere are they sur- rounded there? Is it an atmosphere that breathes of duty and holiness and heaven, or of the world, its successes, its pleasures, its allurements? Is the young man taught to do justly and love mercy, and walk humbly with his God,- or to look forward to a pros- perous career in life, to distinction in his profession or pursuit, as the great end and aim of his being? Is the young lady taught that the best use of life consists in serving her Divine Master like Dorcas of old, in good works and alms-deeds, or in excelling in certain ac- complishments and in making a good match? The husbandman, whose fair anid goodly heritage of broad lands and waving meadows has come down to him from a long line of ancestors, -is accourited thriftless and culpable in the sight of men if he suffers the thorn and the briar, the nocious plant and the evil weed, to usurp the place where once grew fruit beau- tiful to the eye and pleasant to the taste, and corn to strengthen and gladden' the heart of man and give food to the beast. And if such be the judgment pronounced uion him who is a careless steward of temporal possessions, how much more are they to be * '   184      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, condemned, who have charge of that heritage of the Lord,--young immortal spirits,--if they sow not good seed therein, and watch and pray lest the enemy come and sow tares? Her uncle's history, whose painful recital was in-  tended for her benefit, was not lost upon Delia; it  was 'a lesson she never forgot. Whenever, in after periods of doubt and anxiety, she found it difficult n and indeed impossible to solve the many mysterious problems with which her active and inquiring mind was tried, she thought of the strong man humbled to the dust by his presumption, and was admonished not to trust too confidingly in the suggestions and ques- tionings of her own reason. Now that she had heard the confession of one, who knew well how to warn her of danger, she was better able to appreciate the beauty of that holiness of life, and that faith which saw in all of mortal trial and sorrow a Heavenly Father's hand; such holiness of life and such faith as it had been her privilege to wit- ness in Mrs. Lawton, whose wealth and happy family ties had not exempted her from the common expe- rience of mortals; such as supported the soul and ripened the character of old Mrs. Rawson, and such as had been the strength and confidence of Mrs. Temple, in her early sufferings, and more recent afflictions and poverty. As Delia sat pondering the incidents of the sad history to which she had so attentively listened, her mind naturally reverted to the course of her own life since she had been residing in Judge Grafton's fam- ily, and she was astonished to find how often and how far she herself had deviated from the path in which she should have walked.   DELTA ARLINGTON.      185 Upon discovering how little congeniality there was between herself and her cousins, in her pride and self- sufficiency, instead of making any efforts to win their love or regard, she isolated herself as much as possible from them, and followed her own favorite pursuits without any reference to them. She now sincerely regretted she had done so, for Clara, by constant in- quiries during her sickness when she was not allowed to visit her, and by many little acts of kindness sincef had shown so much more heart than she ever spp- posed her to possess, she thought she might. have ob- tained some influence over her had she endeavored to do it. Then there was Fred; of late, even before her sickness, she knew he was friequently under the ban of his father's displeasure, and the only time she had seen him since, she thought he looked unwell, and bore the marks of a mind ill at ease. She could not help asking herself, "AMight not I have done some- thing to induce him to stay at home and give up his evil pursuits?" She knew he was very fond of mu- sic, and for her age she was quite a proficient in that art. There was a fine toned piano-forte in the dining- room, and she knew that oftentimes she might have played or sung for him after her lessons were learned had she been so disposed, and thus perhaps have kept him from seeking such amusements as he found abroad. But she disliked him from the first, and had never troubled herself to conciliate or interest him. But for her love of little Herbert, and the good she had tried to do him, and the kind offices she had per- formed for Mary, she felt that she, in her fancied superiority, had been scarcely at all better than her cousins. They had but followed their own inclina. tions; -what more or better had she done? Even   186      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, Judge Grafton himself, perhaps, she might have con- ciliated, and won at least his respect, if not his regard, had she been less indifferent to his wishes and restric- tions. And she was right, for underneath the crust of worldly pride and ambition, he still possessed an affectionate heart, as the future disclosed to her. Too late, all too late for the past came these regrets, but not too late for the future Delia trusted, and she prayed earnestly to heaven that wisdom and strength . might be given her to pursue a different course in the feMv remaining months of her residence in her aunt's family. The day previous to that fixed for her departure to Judge Grafton's country seat, Delia had ,several vis- itors. She was so fatigued in consequence, that when she retired to rest at night she could not sleep. About midnight, as she lay tossing upon her uneasy pillow, she heard a noise in the passage like the heavy but cautious tread of men's footsteps. Her only thought was of robbers, and, as she was naturally courageous she sprang up, and opening the door, looked out with the purpose of alarming the house. But what was her astonishment and horror, at behold- ing Fred perfectly insensible from intoxication, borne along in the arms of the two men servants, and fol- lowed by Mrs. Robbins, the housekeeper, with a light. As Delia met her eye, she motioned her back and put her finger on her lips to enjoin secrecy. Shocked beyond expression at the condition in which she saw her cousin, Delia retired to bed again, but it was a long time before she was able to close her eyes in sleep. Again and again she asked herself, conscience- smitten as she reviewed the past, ":Might I not have done something to prevent this? and have I not been proudly, wickedly, unconcerned about my cousin?"   DELIA ARLINGTON.      187 Perhaps it was so. Perhaps if her deportment to- ward him had been kind and conciliatory, she might have been the means of saving him from the infamy into which he had fallen. But yet, the character of that young man so far as formed, was but the ripen- ing fruit of seed sown in his tender years. "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?" Fred Grafton was born to the curse; yes, the posi- tive curse of luxury and wealth, as every day's obser- vation is showing in thousands and thousands of instances. The eldest, and for many years the only son, he was early brought to the table at dessert and allowed the manly privilege of sipping a few drops of wine with his father, a never failing accompaniment of the formal and luxurious dinner. The few drops ere long became a glass, the glass, two; and when he became a lad of seventeen, he was able to stand his hand with an apparently cool head, with any veteran club member of them all. But the appetite, thus early fostered and indulged, after it had grown to full strength, would not be satisfied with what the proprieties, always observed at Judge Grafton's table, 'allowed. Consequently, Fred bad his extra bottle in his own room, whenever he could bribe the waiter to provide it for him; failing in this, as he not unfre- quently did, he resorted to the haunts of the low and vile. He did not dare to go to what are called re- spectable places, for fear of encountering his father or some of his friends. Possibly even this appetite, become so fearfully active, might have been kept in check had his home been made agreeable to hitn. 'When a boy he was made to feel that he was al- ways in the wav; nothing was ever done to interest him; no healthful amusement or recreation was pro-   188      STEP BY STEP-- OR, vided for that love of excitement, which is a natural' characteristic of youth, and which needs the most careful and judicious management. He did not love study, and shirked as Imuch as possible his lessons at school. At home, most of his time was passed either in the stable with the coachman, or in the back offices -of the house with the waiter. -His free and easy manners and lively talk made him a great favoritie with the servants, and consequently when they saw that even his mother always connived at, or passed by unrebuked, many things which his father would not have allowed, they, of course, willingly shielded him from blame in whatever way they could, when- ever he was in danger of incurring paternal dis- pleasure. His mother, in her weak indulgence or selfish neglect, would say as mothers have said-before, and as mothers will still continue to say, ' Fred is a little wild perhaps, as all boys of spirit are, but all will come right one of these days." Thlus she quieted, or sought to do it, the still small voice which was ever asking her, "Is it well with thy son?" and went to the party, ball, or concert, whichever it might be, and with her husband, bowed down before the idol of their worship, fashion, and returned home perhaps just after their unfortunate boy had been deposited in his own bed in a state of brutal intoxication. The next morning as Delia was going into her own room, she met her cousin just coming out of his. Both started and looked confused; the one from the consciousness of guilt, the other from her knowledge of what had happened the night previous. As she stood irresolute, her hand on her door, her eyes raised imploringly to him, his countenance assumed almost a fierce expresaion, as he said:   DELIA ARLINGTON.      189 "Do you want anything of me?" "Nothing in particular, Fred, but I am going away to-day." ", Well, and what's that to me? You've never made yourself so agreeable to me with your high airs, and mighty goodness, as to make your absence much of a loss in faith." "I know it, I know it, cousin Fred. I have done very wrong, and I am very sorry. I wish I had tried to make you like me; perhaps if I had, we should have had a good many pleasant hours together, but I thought you didn't like me, and quizzed me when I first came here, and--" "And you returned the dislike with compound in- terest, eh? Well, that's natural enough, I suppose." "But not right, if natural, and I am very sorry for it all. More sorry because I want very much to say something that I have no right to say now; and that, I am afraid, will displease you." Delia paused. There was no mistaking the ex- pression of her cousin's face; it was one of fierce de- fiance, as he planted himself against the banisters. Fancy the young pale girl, as she stood leaning against the door; she trembled in every limb, but she felt that it was her duty to speak, and she poured out the words: "Excuse me, Fred, I know I have no right, but will you not believe that I am interested in you now, and speak only for your good?" He was doggedly silent. "I saw you last night when you were brought home," (saying in her agitation the worst thing she could have said) "and, oh, please never let it be so again."   190      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, -"You saw me, did you?" said he, springing for- ward, his dull eyes sparklin, with rage, and his hag- gard face glowing with excitement. 'a What right have you to be a spy upon my actions? Well, 1 hope, you were gratified with what you saw," he continued, assuming his former sullen manner. "It comes mostly from living in a house where the women are all either so busy with their pleasures, or so taken up with their own goodness as to have 1no time or incli- nation, to give a thought or lift a finger to save a poor fellow from going to the devil as fast as he can, and in any road he chooses to take. Your interest comes too late, my queenly cousin." "Oh! do not talk so. It is not right for you to blame others for what you yourself know is wrong, and it is not generous to talk so to nle, when I tell you how sorry I am for my past conduct towards you. Yes, I know we have all- been to blame; I as much as any one, perhaps; but will you not forgive me, Fred, and do better?"  "Why, yes," said he, softened by her evident -sin- cerity, "I forgive you. Great merit in that, when I've nothing to forgive; but as to doing better, Del-ia, I can't promise. I can't get away from my habits and the company I associate with, although I despise them all, and am disgusted with myself. It's too late now, too late. I'rm wearing out fast, and shan't trouble any one much longer. Besides, I want excitement, and there's nothing for me to turn to." "( No, cousin Fred, it is not too late; and there is One to turn to always, who will listen to you and give you strength according to your need." "You believe that, do you?" I -"Certainly I do, with all my heart."'   DELIA ARLINGTON.      19] "And all those gay ladies and fine gentlemen who dance and gossip, and flirt and dissipate too in their way, as bad as I do in mine, six days in 'the week, and go to church on the seventh in their sillrs and jewels, and look as if they were too good to tread the earth, believe it too, I suppose?" "Yes, dotubtless, although some of them may not be quite consistent with their professions. You can- not judge the heart, you know, from outward appear- r 5  ances." "Can't, eh? Then how do you know but my heart is right too? I don't go to quite such fashionable places as they do to enjoy myself; but notwithstand- ing that, I reckon if they are Christians, i m one too." "Well, whether they are or not, it makes no differ- ence to us, you know, Fred; to our own Master we stand or fall."' "Well, I'm serving, to the best of my ability, I be- lieve, the only master I've known much about since I was a little fellow. I once thought, as you seem to, that there was something in religion, or -might be; but I've given that notion up long ago. Catch me to believe such stuff now." "Oh, Fred, don't talk so. There is a God, and you know there is, and your conscience tells you that you are continually sinning against him." "s Conscience, eh? What's conscience to me now? I've done with that this mnany a month. We parted company when we found we couldn't get along com- fortably together." "I can't bear to hear you say so, Fred. You know it isn't right. Promise me, will you not, that you'll try to do differently for the future; and when you come up to the country, I will do anything in my power for you.'"   192      STEP BY STEP2,--OR, He shook his head, despairingly. "Too late, too late." "It is never too late, Fred. Never too late to re- pent,--never too late to begin a new life,--never too late to change from evil to good." "Well, I will try, Delia. Here's my hand upon it. There must-be something in goodness, after all, or you would never care what became of such a misera- ble dog as I am. Good bye."' "Good bye, Fred. God will help you, if you will help yourself." In another hour Delia left the house, parting kindly from all the family, but her heart deeply saddened by the recollection of her morning's conversation with her cousin.   DELIA ARLINGTON.       193 CHAPTER XVIII. "O Thou God of old! Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these, But so much patience, as a blade of grass Grows by contented through the heat and cold." E. B. BBARRETT. THEY were an unsocial trio as they drove down to the pier to take the steamboat to their place of des- tination up the Hudson, each apparently much ab- sorbed in his or her own thoughts. Mrs. Temple was surprised at Delia's evident depression of spirits, knowing how desirous she had been to go into the country. Once out of the din and bustle of the city, however, and speeding up the river, they became more companionable. Mrs. Temple and Delia found a pleasant seat outside of the saloon, while Mr. How- ard walked backward and forward, stopping at every turn to point out to his niece some new object of in- terest in the beautiful scenery, which was constantly comNing into view. "Look, Delia," said he, at length, "there is Judge Grafton's country seat," pointing as he spoke to a spacious mansion crowning a lofty eminence just above them. "( A pleasant nest for my birdie to sing her songs in this summer, is it not?" "A charming nest for any birdie, I should think," said Delia. "' What a delightful situation; neither too high nor too low. I should not like to live on the mountain top, nor yet in the valley." "A lovely spot, surely," replied Mr. Howard, "for there are hills towering upward in the distance and 17   194      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, meadows below, and this noble river sweeping proudly on to her ocean lord at the base of all. But we have passed the house. Where is the landing?" "Oh, there it is, uncle. I am so glad; only so sorry to lose you." "Never think of that, my dear. Be a good girl and mind Mrs. Temple, and let me find you with roses on those pale cheeks, when I come in the autumn to take you to Massachusetts, as perhaps I may if you are very obedient. I could not leave you in better hands, and I know you will ,endeavor to compensate your kind friend for the sacrifice she has made for you, by getting well as fast as possible." "Indeed, I will not give her any more trouble than I can help, and you will remember your promise and come for me in the autumn?" "If you prove yourself worthy of so great a favor," answered Mr. Howard, forcing a smile, "I will surely come for you, and take you under my wing and bear you away to your eastern home." "Aren't you going up to the house with us, uncle?" "No, my dear, I must keep on in the boat; so good bye, and God bless you both," he added, as he took a hand of each. Neither spoke; but Delia threw her arms closely around her uncle, and clung to him beseechingly. Gently disengaging her he turned away, and securing a carriage placed them in it, and saw them ascending the steep winding road, which led to their place of destination. Arrived at the house, the strangers were received by Mrs. Hosmer, a middle-aged woman, who, with her husband, and an only daughter about fifteen, lived   DELIA ARLINGTON.      195 there throughout the year, and had charge of the establishment in the winter months. She showed them to their rooms, which had been got in readiness in one of the wings of the building, and then went below to hasten preparations for dinner. They found everything arranged for their convenience and com- fort. Their apartments communicated with each other. From both they had a view of the majestic Hudson, and from Delia's an extensive back country prospect also. The hills in the distance seemed to form a shelter for the house in the rear, and protect it from the fury of the winds, to which, on account of its lofty position, it would otherwise have been much exposed. They were soon summoned below to dinner, which awaited them in a cosy little dining-room in the same wing as their own lodgings. Mrs. Hosmer, who already began to take a motherly interest " in the pale young thing," who, as she told her daughter " looked like a speerit more than a cretur of flesh and blood," bustled about to ascertain if every thing suited, and if the young lady would like a little of this, or a little of that, or if she could do anything for her, adding in a low tone when Delia had left the table and taken a seat at the window, "She looks poorly enough, doesn't she?" "She has been very sick," answered Mrs. Temple; but I trust country air, and good, plain living, will re- establish her health. We must give her a plenty of new milk and fresh eggs for her breakfast, Mrs. Hosmer." "Bless her heart, poor dear, she shall have anything that she wants, if it can be mustered in this house; and, indeed, I've had orders to do so too. There's nothing scrimping about the ways of the great folks down in York, if they are a little sot up."   196      STEP BY STEP,- OR To this remark Mrs. Temple made no reply. Mrs. Hosmer continued: "How old, now, is that poor young lady?" "She will be fifteen this summer." "Bless me, you don't say so! Why my Susan was as big agin as she is, when she was only twelve; not so tall, may-b'e, but stouter like." "I dare say," answered Mrs Temple half smiling, as she glanced at Susan, who at that moment came in to attend to the table, at the different appearance of the two. Susan was as fine a specimen, as one often meets with, of a "corn-fed" country girl, with her fat and rosy cheeks, and an arm and ankle nearly as large as Delia's slight waist. Mrs. Temple thought, as she looked at the two girls, what admirable representa- tions they were; the one of physical strength and health, and the other of intellectual development. That first evening in their country home, while Mrs. Temple and Delia were sitting together, watching the beams of the setting sun, as they sparkled on the now placid surface of the river, or shone on the mountain top, or glanced athwart the gilded spire of the village church a mile or two below, Mrs. Temple said to her young companion: "My dear child, if I am to be of any service to you, there must be no reserves between us." "I am sure I don't wish to have any from you, Ma'am." "Nor I from you, Delia, believe me. I know what you are thinking about now. I know what your uncle has told you, and I am glad that it is so." She paused a moment and then said: "I do not wish you to have any more; indeed, you ought not to have so much reluctance in speaking of   DELIA ARLINGTON.      197 him to me, than you would have had if you had never known about our former relations to each other. I do not hesitate to say that I once loved him very dearly; but that has been over for years. I formed new ties, and now I live solely for my duty to my God and my children. I respect and regard your uncle very highly as a friend, and I wish you to talk with me freely about him. I assure you, that it will be far more pleasant than painful to me." "Oh, thank you, Mrs. Temple. I am very glad you say so; I don't know how I could live with you and never speak of him. It was easy enough in New York; I never wanted to there, because I knew Maria would call him an eccentric genius; she seems to think eccentricity a crime almost; and Clara, a queer old fudge. I couldn't bear that, you know. But you, I want to tell you everything. I have never had any one before at all like a mother, to whom I could talk." "I will assume my motherly office at once, Delia, and ask why you were so very sad this morning, com- ing up the river? I thought you would rejoice in the change, and you know, you could not have kept your uncle in New York longer. "O h, indeed it was not that at all, which troubled me, Mrs. Temple. I was glad to come up here, since I was to have you with me. But--"Here her tears prevented her from concluding. After her agitation had subsided, she unburdened her troubled conscience and anxious mind respect- ing her cousin Fred. Mrs. Temple was silent a few moments after Delia had concluded, and then said: "You might, doubtless, have pursued a different 17*   198      STEP BY STEP,---OR, course towards your cousin, and perhaps, with good results. But-I fear if you had, you would only have succeeded in staying for a season his downward career. The unfortunate circumstances of his early education and associations would have proved too strong for you to combat successfully, in your unset- tled state of mind. But it is useless so spend pre- cious time in regretting the past, except that thereby you are strengthened in any good resolutions you may have formed for the future. St. Paul says, 'Forgetting those things which are behind, and reach- ing forth unto those which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high- calling of God in Christ Jesus.' You will have an opportunity this summer to try your influence with him. Poor, poor fellow; he must have some element of good in him, or he would not have been softened by your appeal.' "Yes, he has. I am sure he has; but with no one to care for him, I mean to look after him much,--I'm sure my aunt is fond of all her children,- what can he do, or what will he do, different from what he has done? He will try, perhaps, to change, but he will never succed." "It is not for you to say that, Delia. It is never right to despair. God may yet permit you to be the means of his salvation." ' I? I? so unworthy?" "That you feel your unworthiness is an important step gained, in that knowledge of your own heart, and that self-discipline, which will enable you to have a good influence upon others. The self-righteous have not much power over their fellow creatures. You said, that, in your pride, you repelled your cousin from you before." ' Yes, Ma'amn, I fear I did."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      199 "Well, my dear, I must forbid any more exciting conversation to-night. You are weary, and you must obey orders, you know, until you are able to take charge of yourself again. Now you must-prepare to retire to rest." Mrs. Temple read in the low musical tones of her sweetly modulated voice, the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel of St. John, to the weary and dispirited girl. When she read the verse, "And ye now, therefore, have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you," the assurance of joy to come, seemed to Delia's touched and softened heart a direct promise to her, and it soothed and encouraged her. After reading the Scriptures, Mrs. Temple offered up a simple, ear- nest prayer of gratitude and praise and confession, such as was her wont in her home devotions. When Mrs. Temple went to Delia's room to see that she was comfortable, the latter pressed her hand warmly and said, "Thank you." She did not say for what, but Mrs. Temple understood her; and she was repaid for the sacrifice it had been to her to leave her 'only daughter, from whom she had never before been parted. After the excitement and novelty consequent upon her change of residence, had passed away, Delia relapsed into her former state of languor and indif- ference. The grounds of Judge Grafton's estate were very extensive. They were laid out with much taste, and, from their situation, comprised considerable variety of scenery. On one side they reached back among the hills; and here art had interfered with nature no farther than to make convenient paths, and place   WU      STEP BY STEP,-OR, seats under the brow of some overshadowing rock, or beneath the branches of some protecting tree; at the right, stretching towards the north, was a noble growth of wood, where one might wander almost at will, the underbrush having been carefully removed; below the wood, towards the water, was the kitchen" garden; in front was a beautiful lawn; while to the left was a tastefully arranged and carefully kept flower-garden. Upon the left of the lawn there was a little bay formed by a curve in the river, where had been placed some rustic seats, and so sheltered was the spot by the overhanging branches of trees, that one could be hidden there from all observation, and yet have a full view of the Hudson and its ever- changing burden of sails. This quiet little nook, to which there was a path through the flower-garden, became a favorite resort to, Delia; and day after day, when the weather was sufficiently mild, found her there reclining dreamily upon one of the seats or upon the ground, with a thick plaid to protect her from the dampness, her head resting on her hand or on a pil- low. As the two were sitting there one afternoon, Delia more than usually abstracted, Mrs. Temple said to her: "Why do you like this spot so much, my dear?" "Like it? Do you not like it, too?" "Certainly I do," said Mrs. Temple smiling, but you have not answered my question by asking another. That is said to be Yankee fashion, and you surely are not a native of Yankee land." "Oh, I like it because it is so quiet, and calm, and peaceful here; everything is suggestive of rest, rest, and that is so delightful to me now! I don't think I care for anything else. Is it not strange, when I used to be so active?"   DELIA ARLINGTON.      201 "No, not very strange, my dear. You must recol- lect, you have been a very sick girl, and have not yet recovered your strength; and I don't know as you ever will, unless you make greater effort than hitherto you have been disposed to do. After all, Delia, there is no rest in this world. Look at the water as it curls and eddies at your feet; it is ever in motion. Look at the clouds over your head; ' on, on, forever. Look around you, and behold how all insect-life is moving ever. There is no rest, no rest here." "There is comparative rest at least. Everything is so different here from the city, and indeed from any other spot in this region. It is true," she con- tinued, after a moment's pause, "I am the only idler about. Even the leaves over my head are rustling a faint answer to the whispering breeze. I shall be obliged to recall my old nursery fable of the little child who was unable to find flower, bird, or bee, to play with him, because each had some duty to per- form. But I am sure there must be rest in heaven, or we should never long for it so much on earth." "But is it our minds, our aspiring souls, or our wearied, over-taxed bodies, which so much require rest, do you think?" "I never thought about it at all. I only know that I myself desire nothing so much as rest. But in answer to your question, I should say, both the body and the mind, for one must affect the other." "Do you remember what Tupper says about rest, in his Proverbial Philosophy?" "Not very distinctly. I know to what you refer, I think. It is something about rest in heaven, is it not?" "Yes, I will repeat the lines to you, if you wish."   202       STEP BY STEP)---ORB "Do, dear Mrs. Temple. Seekest thou rest, O immortal! hope not to find it in heaven, For sloth quieteth not happiness ; the bliss of a spirit is action. Rest dwelleth only on an - island in the midst of the ocean of exist- ence, Where the world-weary soul may for a while fold its tired wings, Until after a short sufficient slumber, it is quickened into deathless energy, And speedeth in eagle-flight to the Sun of unapproachable perfec- tion.' " "They are beautiful lines, and I suppose true; yet our Saviour says, ' Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.'" "Very true, my dear; but is it not rest from sin, its strifes, and agonies and wrestlings, which the Saviour gives? the oil of salvation poured upon the troubled waters of worldly follies and crimes? I can- not attach any other meaning to it. Heaven could not be heaven, if those who enter its peaceful abodes shall have no employment there.- Oh no, the angel choirs, which surround the throne of the Almighty, ascribing ' blessing, and honor, and glory, and power to Him   that sitteth thereon and unto the Lamb, forever and ever,' - are not harps of praise played by other hands. From within, from the depths of their own awakened and exalted souls are poured their songs of praise and adoration. And as they are, may we not hope to be, upon our entrance into the world of bliss? Not idle loiterers there, but those, who are active evermore in the service of the Infinite- and Holy One?" "Oh," said Delia, "I shall never be one of that blessed company if I sit here all the day idle. What shall I do?" "Nothing very arduous just at present, but some- *          *  *   DELIA ARLINGTON.      203 thing I would strive to do every day. Your uncle, unless his tastes are strangely changed, is fond of drawing, and a good judge of it also. You told me you had not found since you came to New York as much time, as you would like, to attend to it. Here is a good opportunity for you. Bring your port- folio with you to-morrow and sketch awhile. Earn the right to be idle by honest fatigue; I shall not be a hard task-mistress." "Oh that will be charming; if you will teach me." "With pleasure." "Let me see," said Delia, with increased anima- tion; " to-morrow I shall sketch that little head-land, which I will call Cape Hope. See how boldly it strikes out into the river, and how quietly the wave- lets approach to kiss its feet, as it were, in homage to its fearlessness." "True picture of to-day," said Mrs. Temple. Only yesterday, you recollect, the angry waves dashed fiercely against that very point. There was no kiss of homage then, but rather daring and defi- ance." "All the truer picture of life then, is it not? I will sketch it in both moods, the gentle and the turbulent; and when I am stormy and possessed with the spirit of unrest, I will look on the peaceful scene; and when I am idle or listless I will look on the stormy one, to rouse me to do battle with the raging waves of life." "Well thought of, my dear. Make your sketches your monitors, and you will do very well." "( Then I may aspire to something greater, may I not, Mrs. Temple? Yonder mountain top, away off   204     STEP BY STEP,--OR, in the distant blue, would not that make a marked feature in a sketch? suggestive of that heavenly world, into which it seems to be looking? This broad and beautiful view with the countless and varied craft upon its bosom, would make another sketch; 'how emblematical of human life; the river and its burdens all floating on, to their destined end. How much work I have laid out for myself. Is not this making a good beginning?" From that day Delia's improvement was more rapid. Her mind, weakened by sympathy with bodily illness, no longer left to prey upon itself, recovered in a great measure its natural tone, and reacting in its turn on the body, she was soon able, when Helen came up Saturday, as she usually did to spend the Sabbath, to climb with her the hill-sides, and roam through the forests now clothed in their garments of freshness and beauty. In two or three weeks Mary came up with little Herbert, whom Delia welcomed so joyfully, thlat the little fellow threw his fat arms around her neck, and whispered : "Herby gad tozen Dele got back again." "It is you, who are back, pet, I should think," said Delia. "No, its Dele back. Dat was'nt nice Dele at home; it was Dele dat looked solly all the time." "Well let's have a run, and see if I am solly now." As Herby went scrambling and rolling along, down he came on the soft carpet of green grass, and Delia after him. Then they sat and played, until Mary came to take him away to bed. Delia got up flushed with her violent exercise, and her countenance glow- ing with genuine happiness. It would have been   DELIA ARLINGTON.      205 difficult to say which enjoyed country life most; Delia or little Herbert. Young as he was, he appeared to- have a keen appreciation of everything beautiful. It was amusing to listen to his descriptions of whatever attracted his attention. 'Oh, Dele, what pretty sparkles," pointing to the sunbeams dancing on the water, "prettier a gate deal than mammna' necklace." One morning Delia went into his room just as the sun was rising, and found him standing upon a little cricket looking out at the window. "Oh, Dele," said he, as the sun's golden beams illurnined the trees and every object upon which they rested, with their cheering effulgence, " how beauful the gardens is." "More beautiful than Union Park, Herby?" "Oh yes, Herby think so, cause it so bright and shiny here; everyting shine up here." "Then you love Greenville better than New York?" "Oh tousand hundred times; Herby like everyting here, pretty flowers, soft grass, trees, chickens, every- ting." Delia took an early opportunity to question Mary about the family in New York. She answered her evasively, simply saying that they were getting on pretty well. "Pretty well? Is that all?" "Well, that's about all folks can get on in this world, aint it, Miss? I never saw any body that was always prospering, 'at all times. Rich folks have their troubles as well as us poor ones." "If there has been any trouble about Fred, tell me all, Mary, do, at once," said Delia earnestly. 18   206      STEP BY STEP--OR, "Then yoju know, Miss Delia?' "Yes, I know what happened before I left the city, and I know all is not right with him." "( No Miss, all's just wrong, I should say. And now his honor the Judge has found out some of his goins on, and has threatened him so fierce like before the men, that master Fred vows he'll die before he'll sub- mit to such a tyrant. Oh, dear, dear, you don't know what a terrible time we've had of it, Miss. The Judge looking blacker nor any thunder cloud you ever did see, and all but swearing, he that's so grandlike gen- erally; first at young master, then at the servants, and at last turning to mistress, and saying, 'this is the way you look after your son, madam, connivering (or some such word) at his wild pranks; he'll bring disgrace upon us, and all in consequence of your weak indulgence.' I've hearn say, Miss, a worm will turn if trod on; and sure enough mistress who is as feer'd of his honor as any of us I believe, turned upon him and answered,' If you had not been so strict with your boy, Judge Grafton, and punished him so severely for every little fault, there would have been no necessity for my shielding him.' ' Silence, madam,' cried out the Judge, in a voice so furious, that we all quaked in our shoes. And she was Silent, and the Judge sent us all away, for he had called in every one, who, he thought would know about master Fred's doins, warning us against ever helping young master in any of his scrapes." "Well, how do matters stand now?" "Master Fred is in disgrace fike, and sulks about the house, but don't come to the table, as, indeed, his honor told him he needn't till he could behave bet- 3-: ter. He hasn't had any more scrapes since; but I'm ^^. -'       .          "  ^ A   DELIA ARLINGTON.      207 feered he will. If he does, that Taylor, with all his grand airs, is such a sneak, I'm just certain he'll tell of him. Oh, Miss, I never thought to see tryiner times than I'd seen at home in the auld country, when we were all down with the famine; but one way, this comes worse like: for we didn't cause the famine, and we bore it as sent from God to punish-our sins, and kept love in our hearts all the while; but here, to my mind, they've just brought all this trouble on their- selves." "Well, it's no use to discuss that, Mary. Did you see Fred before you came up?" "Bless you, Miss, yes, the very day, and he told me to tell Mrs. Hosmer, who sets a deal by him, 'cause she nursed him when he was a baby, that he wouldn't leave the country without coming up to see her." "Leave the country? what do you mean?" "Yes, Miss, that's in his mind, and I don't doubt he'll do it."   208      STEP BY STEP, - OR, CHAPTER XIX. "So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear, Farewell remorse; all good to me is lost; Evil, be thou my good."    MLTON. ONE lovely evening in May, as Delia was walking, about dusk, to and fro, on the piazza, in front of the house, enjoying the unusual pleasantness of the hour, her attention was drawn from time to time, as she came to the end nearest the wood, to what appeared to be the figure of a man among the trees. She gave not much heed to it at first, but as it remained in about the same place for some time, her curiosity was excited, as to who it might be, and what object he might have in being there. She thought it might be a robber taking a survey of the premises prepara- tory to attempting an entrance by night. As she paused in her walk, considering what she ought to do, she heard her own name called in a hoarse and indistinct voice, which she did not read- ily recognize, although it seemed to her that she ought to know it. She made no answer, however, but stood listening in the expectation of hearing it again. Once more she heard the same voice, in a little louder, but still a suppressed tone, calling, "Delia, Cousin Delia." As quick as thought she rushed down the steps, opened the little gate that led into the wood, and found herself, as she expected, face to face with her cousin Fred. But how changed, even from the last time she had seen him. He looked as if years, not so much of age as of dissipation and weariness of spirit, had passed over him.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      209 How different were the marks which the last few weeks had left on those two young persons! Time writes with a firm, unfaltering hand, the records of his march on the human face; but the lines which are traced there do not necessarily give to it a harsh or an unlovely expression. On the contrary, how often is it that there is a beauty, scarcely of this world, in the features of age, not possessed by them in youth, which more than compensates for the roses and lilies of which the lapse of years deprives the fairest of the sons and daughters of earth. But vice, but dissipa- tion, what fearful, what indelible marks does this fell demon leave upon his victims, saying thereby to all who are able to read the human face aright, "Neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor length of days wrought the waste which you behold here. This is my work, mine. These are the marks of sin." Oh, what sadder sight than this can man or angel look upon! A child of God, a being created in the image of God, endowed with the attribute of free- will, and capable of the highest attainments in virtue and holiness, choosing the wages of sin, which is death, and bearing about with him, whithersoever he goes, the unmistakable evidences of infamy and shame. These were not exactly Delia's thoughts, as she looked upon her cousin, but they took some such-a form in the moment's pause that intervened, before she could recover herself sufficiently to address him. In the meanwhile, he stood leaning against a tree, without uttering a single'word of greeting. "Where did you come from, Fred? When did you come up? Why have you not been in the house?"   210      STEP BY STEP,---OR, she asked at last in rapid succession, scarcely know- ing what she said. "It is no matter" he answered almost fiercely, "when I came up; my business here is with you. EIve come to test your prom',se, that you would do anything you could for me. Do you remember it?" it Yes, Fred, very distinctly, and I will." "Well, then, I want fifty dollars to-night, or three days hence at the latest. Give me that, and I will never trouble you or disgrace" -the last word was pronounced with a bitter emphasis,--" his honor Judge Grafton again." "Why, Fred, I haven't fifty dollars in my posses- sion, and my uncle would never send me so large a sum, without knowing what use I intended to make of it." "Just as I expected. Everybody is ready to kick a, fellow down hill, if he once gets a start." "At least, tell me what you want of it, and I will write to my uncle to-night, if I think it is what he will approve of."  "Well, you can judge. Of course, he will approve of it. He believes in honoring one's father, doesn't he? And obeying one's father, I talie to be honoring him, eh?" "Yes, if he commands what it is right for you to do, or does not speak in haste or in a passion."' "It's not for me to judge about that. His honor Judge Grafton, my respected father, bade me last night go out of his sight, and hide my head wherever I could, so as not to bring any more disgrace on his worshipful name. There's a ship to sail in a few days for China, and a chap or two on board, whom I know, will help me to get a sailor's berth. Ishould   DELIA ARLINGTON,      2" like nothing better. It will be killing two birds with one stone, you see,-- honoring my father and pleasing myself. All I want is a little of the ready." Such cool recklessness of manner, such a bitter undercurrent of feeling as this language indicated, quite overpowered Delia with amazement. She stood silent and motionless. Would God help her to say the right word? Enable her to speak to her cousin so as to soften, and not to harden still harder his heart? She did not know,--she was timid and doubting. Still she felt that she must act, and she would do what she could. "Cousin Fred," she answered, "I meant all I said when I offered to do anything I could to assist you; but I did not mean that I would assist, you to your own ruin." I'm on that road now,- so don't have any scruples of conscience on that account." "You are note so far on that road that you cannot turn back from it. If you will only give yourself up to good influences, as you have been doing to evil, you will be able to regain the favor you have lost," replied Delia, earnestly, almost indignantly. "So you say, as I expected you would. Well, that's the way of the world. I came for money, and money I want and must have,--and behold, 1 get advice! Advice is cheap; even I could give it, poor devil as I am." ' Don't talk so, Fred, it is wrong; you don't know what you are saying." "- What care I about right and wrong. I want money, so as to be able to prove myself a dutiful SOhl        yo "Oh, Fred, why will you talk so? If your father   212      STEP BY STEP--- OR, was severe with you, have you not given him cause? You, his eldest son, almost a man? Would you now add to his displeasure and your mother's grief, by going away a common sailor, with the very company that have already led you into evil?" "Delia, it is useless for you to talk to me in this way. My father and my mother have made me what I am. My father, by indulging me in some things hurtful to me, and by his great severity towards me when in other things I transgressed his rules; and my mother, by never caring enough about me to know where I was or what I was doing. How could I be anything different from what I am. I couldn't live without my pleasures, any more than they would without theirs, egad. I wanted excitement, and I knew where to find it. And what is it to me how they feel about it now, when instead of caring for my ruin, for I am ruined, my father thinks so much about the disgrace it will bring upon his name, if it is known. So, if you won't lend me the money, send Mrs. Hosmer to me, for I shan't hear- another word from you. I'm desperate, I tell you, and I will do as I say." Delia, seeing that in his present mood, it was worse than useless to argue with him, left him and hastened away to find Mrs. Hosmer, hoping that she might know some way to soften his heart, and then went to Mrs. Temple to relate to her this fresh trouble. "What is to be done?. Can you tell me, Mrs. Temple? Can he not be saved?" "The first thing, my dear, is to wait and see what effect -Mrs. Hosmer is able to produce upon him. If she cannot persuade himn to remain here quietly till his father's and his own anger. have had time to cool,   DELIA ARLING TON.      213 Judge Grafton must be immediately informed of the step he intends to take." "Oh, Mrs. Temple, if he goes to China he will never return, never. He looks wretchedly ill already, and so changed since- I saw him last; and I can never forget how he looked then," said Delia, bursting into tears. What persuasions Mrs. Hosmer used, Delia did not know, but in about an hour the good motherly woman tapped at her door, and coming in, said "At least, I have him safe in bed for to-night." Her kindly and honest face bore traces of recent tears. In answer to Delia's inquiry, if she had been able to dis- cover under what circumstances he left his father's house, Mrs. Hosmer gave' iin substance the following account: After the encounter with his father, of which Mary had brought the report, Fred remained at home the greater part of the time, having nothing to do, he said, but listen to the promptings of the devil ; for he seemed to have a firm conviction.4hat he was bound over to his service. At last, his craving for the wine cup, which had never before been denied hiim at home, became so strong, that ha determined to brave everything for it. Accordingly the night previous, knowing that his father had gone out, he went off to one of his, old haunts, intending to return before him. But, unfortunately for his intention, under the influ- ence of intoxication, time passed insensibly, and when at last he reeled home and tottered up the steps, it was to have the door opened by his enraged parent,. to whom Taylor, as Mary had predicted, had disclosed his being out. The sight of his father effectually sobered him, and   f214     STEP BY STEP,--OR, he stood in the hall like a culprit awaiting his doom. Judge Grafton's anger knew no bounds, and in lan- guage so violent and intemperate, that even the servile waiter, who stood by listening, was actually terrified. He poured forth his wrath on his misguided son, ever recurring, as Fred said, to the one fact, which seemed to possess the greatest importance in his eyes,- the , disgrace that was thus brought on his own name,-- and ended by bidding his son begone, and never return again until he could do it without dishonor and shame to his family. Whether he really intended to send his son forth a vagabond on the face of the earth, Mrs. Hosmer was unable to decide. She was unwilling to believe he did. Be that as it may, at those words, so full of cruelty upon a father's lips, Fred snatched up his hat and darted out, saying as he went, "I will never darken your doors again, sir, while I live," and rushed f  into the street. He walked to and fro until he was utterly ex- hausted,.then returning to the place where he had spent the evening, formed the plan he had communi- cated to Delia. That day he took the boat up the river. "He vows he'll ship for China, and if I don't let him have money, he says he'll get it some other way, fair or foul, he doesn't much care which," continued the good woman, sobbing. "But he's shipped for another port than China, I'm afraid. If he was only bound for Canaan, I shouldn't much care. But, oh, that he should die; that blessed babe that I used to hold in my arms, so beautiful with his pretty curls and sweet brown eyes, die in his sins. . Oh, it will break my heart," and she wept like a child.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      215 -  Die?" said Delia, astounded. "Yes, you dear cretur, and that I should have lived to see it. You see, he's been on this course all winter more or less, and that's enough of itself to kill a lad no stronger than he, let alone last night's work. But you see it was damp and drizzly, and he got cold wandering about so, though he said he was hot enough till he laid down in that hall to sleep, and then he felt such chills and racking pains come on, he could hardly stand it. He says he'll be well enough to-morrow, but I know better than that. To see him as he is now, and to think what -a darling baby he was once, oh, dear, oh, dear, the Lord be more gra- cious to him than he's been to himself. What's the use of gold, when it can't keep off such trouble as this. Poor as I am, if I'd a had the training of him, this never'd happened. And how can- his mother rest a night without knowing where her boy is. He's not more altered than she; a loviner mother or a prouder one than she, you wouldn't see anywhere with her son- in her arms. But I must go and look after him. I'll never desert him if other people do." So saying, she bustled off to watch and wait beside the couch of the youth, whose pale and haggard face and wasted form, brought tQ her mind only the recol- lection of the brown locks and cherub face of his innocent babyhood. "What is to be done?" asked Delia, imploringly, of Mrs. Temple, as Mrs. Hosmer left. "Reckless and desperate as he is, what is to be done to prevent him- from putting his mad scheme into execution?" "The Lord will point out, my child. Even now, it may be, His hand is laid upon him in sickiness even unto death. Better, far better death, than such a life,   216      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, as his parents in their carelessness, and he in his wil-- fulness, have marked out for him." "Oh!" ejaculated Delia, earnestly, "that I may have the privilege of striving to awaken in him the hope of something higher and holier." "Amen," solemnly replied Mrs. Temple.   DELIA ARLINGTON.       217 CHAPTER XX. "This life of ours is a wild molian-harp of many a joyous strain, But under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail, as of souls ia pain."             LONGFELLOW. "MAN proposes, but God disposes," is a true, but homely proverb, -and it was not His will that the mad scheme of the impulsive, reckless boy should be car- ried into execution. The morning on which he swore with an oath, that chilled the warm blood of good Mrs. Hosmer to hear, and which she had forborne to repeat to Mrs. Temple and Delia, that he would leave his native soil, and never, never darken his father's doors again until recalled by him, found him prostrate on a bed of sickness and suffering, unable to rise, and scarcely able to speak, so severely had his cold affected him. Mrs. Hosmer sent for the doctor by early dawn, who at once pronounced the case a violent inflamma- tion of the lungs. "Will it go hard with the poor lad, sir? inquired Mrs. Hosmer, following the physician to the door. "I fear so," was the reply. a( The case, though a severe one, would not be so alarming had the patient been enjoying for some time past good health, or did he possess a good constitution, neither of which unfortunately is the case." "Oh, dear, dear, what shall I do?" said the good woman. "The first thing to be done, Ma'am, is to write or send to his father and mother; the next, is to attend him carefully, as I am sure you will, and maintain a 19   10l      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, cheerful deportment in his presence. When did he come from the city?" "4 Last night, sir, and he had such a shocking cold, I know'd he would be sick." "Yes, he has evidently taken a heavy cold, but there is more than that at work with him. Doctors, Mrs. Hosmer, are sometimes able to read the moral as well as the physical state of their patients, even when they may be powerless to heal either. Alas!" he added in a lower tone, " what broken reeds the chil- dren of this generation are to lean upon?" "If I might be so bold, sir, as to say it, the world's no right to look for anything better than broken reeds while parents neglect their children as they do, going to balls and parties, being in the fashion, living high, and letting their children do the same, and then blaming the poor things for doing just what they are brought up to. This boy, bless his heart, was as sweet a baby and little fellow as ever you set your eyes on, Doctor. Is it his fault, anyhow, that he's no better now, and has come to this strait?" "Lucifer the fallen, Ma'am, was once a bright son of the morning, an angel of light. God gives us all a monitor within to show us what is good, and to lead us into the paths of uprightness. He trusts no single child of His to the best of earthly parents, without this monitor, for He knows how frail we all are. Yonder infatuated boy has not heeded that still small voice, which has ever been admonishing him, and calling to him to turn from the evil of his ways." "I can't say, Doctor, I'm a plain woman, and don't know much about Lufiser and such gentry, but my good man says it's mortal hard for anybody to be al- ways rowing agin the tide. Down in York the tide   DELIA ARLINGTON.       219 sets strong to pleasure and fashion, and indulging one s appetites, and I don't see how you could expect a lad to row agin it, when it's jest what his own car- nal natur took to. And if he didn't attend to the still small voice, he's not the first that hasn't by many a gray haired sinner. My Bible tells me, it's parents' duty to look arter their children. May be, you've hear'd this verse afore, Doctor: ' Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old he will not depart from it.' Don't be too hard on the lad, when, to my thinking, he's the least to blame any way." '"God forbid that I should be hard on any young lad or man either, as to that, Mrs. Hosmer. I have a son who needs all a father's prayers, I doubt not, for he is separated from me by full half the earth's cir- cumference. But there is one thing, Mrs. Hosmer, we are all too apt to forget, and that is, in excusing the erring and the sinning, we often indirectly blame Him who controls the destiny of each one of us. I meant nothing 'more in what I said, than that we should remember that no one goes astray unwarned or unrebuked. God leaves none of his children with- out a lamp to their feet, if they will but follow its light." "You're about right, I reckon," said Mrs. Hosmer to herself, as the Doctor left the house, "and you've a right to talk as you do, growing up as you did, I've heard my mother tell, out of such a nest of vipers as all the ,Hilton family, but yourself, a pious and godly man, were said to be. One comfort is, God's merci- ful, and if it's not His will that the boy should live, he may die repentant." Thus soliloquized Mrs. Hosmer, as she hastened away to ask Delia what was to be done about send- ,  * ^'- '   220     STEP BY STEP-- OR, ing for Judge and Mrs. Grafton. Mrs. Temple ad- vised that a trusty messenger should be despatched in the morning's boat, which would soon be along, di- rectly to the house. Delia sat down to write a note, while Mrs. Hosmer went for a messenger. This done, Delia went herself to see her cousin, whom she found suffering too severely to heed her. Returning to her own room, she offered a fervent prayer to her Heavenly Father in behalf of her cousin, and then, agitated and depressed, sought Mrs. Temple. "Bear up, my child, nobly against this fresh trou- ble," said this kind and sympathizing friend. ' God may have granted your prayers, and will now afford you an opportunity to minister to your cousin's com- fort, and show your interest in him." "But, Mrs. Temple, if he should die, die in his sins, and so young too." "Living or dying he will be in the hands of an all- merciful Father, as well as of a righteous Judge." "That is the only consolation in view of such an event. And yet only think what a life he has been living." "That cannot be changed now, and if you wish to do your cousin any good, it will be better not to dwell too sadly upon it. I wish to speak with you upon another subject, my dear. If your aunt and family come up, as of course they will, I must return home You no longer need me, and indeed your aunt, if I mistake not, will require so much of your time, that there would be little opportunity for you to be mud with me." To Mrs. Temple's surprise, Delia made no objec tion, and presently said, "Do not think me ungrateful Mrs. Temple, that I do not regret your leaving mor   DELIA ARLINGTON.-      221 than I appear to do. You know how lonely I shall be without you; but I trust I shall be able, in some measure, to redeem the unfaithful use I have hitherto made of the talents that have been intrusted to me. I can never have a better opportunity, and I will prove my gratitude to you in acts, if I may, rather than in words." "By far the most acceptable way to me, my dear; and if I have been any aid' or comfort to you, dear motherless child, I am rejoiced;" and she kissed her affectionately as she spoke. Delia was too much agitated to reply. Mrs. Tem- ple concluded to remain until the next day, and it was fortunate that she did; for when, upon Mrs. Grafton's arrival, she was taken into her son's room, the condition in which she found him had such an effect upon her weak nerves, that she fainted entirely away, and recovered only to go into hysterics. Mrs. Temple's kind attentions and judicious remedies at last revived her, and she soon was able to sit up, but was entirely powerless to think or act. After Mrs. Temple's departure, Delia seemed at once to become a woman. To her Mrs. Hosmer ap- plied for advice and direction, and upon her Mrs. Grafton leaned as a child might, upon the superior judgment and strength of an older person. Judge Grafton was summoned from the city the day following that on which his wife came. When he entered the sick room. Delia, who was present, marked his countenance well, as his eye rested upon his son lying prostrate an that bed of severe suffering, and wrestling for life as it were with the angel of death. What his thoughts were no mortal could tell, but she thought she saw a mist gather over his r           .   222      STEP BY STEP-- OR, eyes; and she knew, when a few minutes later, he made some commonplace inquiry of Mrs. Hosmer, that his voice was hoarse and trembling. Could he, indeed, could the most selfish of parents be otherwise than moved to the very depths of his heart, at beholding that saddest of all sad sights, the wreck of a once noble spirit, or the utter desolation of so much that was fair and promising in childhood; for Mrs. Hosmer's praises of the darling, whose in- fancy she had watched over with so much pride, were not the fond exaggerations of partiality. The ele- ments of his character were good, and those very traits and qualities through which he was led astray, under judicious management and direction might have been developed into some of the noblest princi- ples of action. This might have been. Alas! how common is the remark. Of how many a wayward young man, of how many a lost soul has it been made! This might have been! Who shall say whether the proud, self-relying man, had not some misgivings with regard to the system of education he had pursued with his child! How this was, none knew but Him who readeth alike the hearts of the proud and the humble; for to no one, not even to his own wife, did he utter a single word of confession or self-reproach, or even of doubt. When at last that sick son cast upon his father a glance of recognition, in which there was not the faintest shadow of a smile, the latter abruptly turned away and left the room, and for hours after was heard pacing the floor of his remote apartment with the dull measured tread of one who has lost his self-conscious- ness in some absorbing subject of interest. Days had passed, The inflammation was subside   DELIA ARLINGTON.       223 ing and the fever with it, and it now remained to be seen whether the young man had sufficient strength of constitution to rally even temporarily from such an attack; and the question went forth from those anxious hearts gathered in that home of sickness, "Will he, die?"It came from Mrs. Grafton's lips in the accents of wild despair; from Mrs. Hosmer in the deep earnestness of one who trembles for fear of what answer will be given; and from Delia in the more cheerful tones of one, who hopes while she doubts; it rose to Judge Grafton's lips, but the stern, proud man repressed its utterance, and looked the question he dared not trust himself to ask in words. Doctor Hilton addressed,his reply to Mrs. Grafton: "You must hope for the best, Madam. Care and fresh country air will undoubtedly do more for him now than I can. He is certainly gaining at present." Evasive as this answer was, it calmed the mother's nervous fears, and she almost complained to Delia at what she regarded the unnecessary fright Doctor Hil- ton had given her, and began immediately to form plans for the summer. It was now quite time, she said, for the girls to come into the country; they would help amuse Fred, while he was confined to the house. Mrs. Hosmer was almost angry with her because her anxiety could be so easily quieted; but she concluded on the whole, it was better so than that the whole house should be kept in a state of constant confusion by a succession of hysteric fits. "For the life of me," said the kind-hearted woman, in a confidential aside to Mary, "I don't know how we should ever have got along, if Miss Delia hadn't the clearest head in the world on her young shoulders.   224      STEP BY STEP,---OR, To see how she, just up from a heavy sickness herself, would first help me in the sick room, then go to wait and tend on her aunt in one of her fits, and be ready to take messages and directions from kitchen to bed- room and back agin, and so calm like all the time; it beats me to see how some folks seem born with sense to do everything needed, while some can't eat without you put the spoon to their mouths. I'm thinking Mrs. Grafton's head is not so strong like as it might be, or she'd never give up so." "I should think," said Mary, "Mrs. Grafton would feel sorry now she left Miss Delia so much to herself, when she was sick, but I don't suppose she thinks much about it. As for Miss Maria, I won't say what I think about her." "Least said soonest mended; as you can't say much that is good about that piece of pride, you bet- ter say nothin at all, Miss O'Flinger." "My name is O'Flinnegan, at your sarvace, Ma'am," said Mary, in the broadest brogue she could pronounce. "But you was talking about Miss Delia. It'll be a sorrowful day to us when she goes away. I don't know how I'll ever get along without her sweet- face and sweeter words." "Why, isn't she to live here always? I thought she was an orphan." "So she is, more's the sorrow, poor dear; but her father was a knowledgable man, and a curious one too, from all I hear, and he wanted her to live a year here, and then a year somewhere else, and after that choose her home between the two; so she telled me herself. An' it isn't very likely she'll choose to come back here agin." "There's no tellin'; anyhow, don't you go to borry   DELIA ARLINGTON.      22 trouble about that. If I can only see Master Fred well, and goin' on as he should, I'd ask nothing better." "Oh, dear," answered AMary, "the Lord save us from Master Herby's ever growing to the likes of him." "I don't know why he mightn't as well as this one. Master Fred was every bit as fine a little fellow as Herby there." "I dare say, Mrs. Hosmer," said Mary, softly, to mollify the good woman's rising wrath, " but may-be, an' sure it isn't f6r the likes of you to wish it mayn't be so; may-be, as I was saying, the Lord'll put it into the hearts of his parents to look after him more than ever they have for this one." "I'll say amen to that with all my heart. But, bless me, Mary, while we are talking about our bet- ters, it's time young master had his medicine." "I don't know about our betters," said Mary to herself, as Mrs. Hosmer hastened to the sick room, "except Miss Delia. I should say good hearts made betters; and I never saw a kinder one than that woman has, if she is a Protestant, more's the pity. I'll ask Father Riley to talk to her some day, if he comes the rounds this way, as he promised he would." Thus speaking out her thoughts, she went into the garden in search of Herbert, who she knew was with Delia. A few mornings later, as Judge Grafton was walk- ing in the avenue that led from the public road to his house, he met Doetor Hilton. Both paused involun- tarily, although neither spoke for some seconds; at last the Judge requested the Doctor to join him in the summer-house back of the mansion, after he had visited his patient.   226      STEP BY STEP) --OR) What passed in that interview was never known. Delia, who chanced to meet the Judge about half an hour after it, was startled at the ghastly expression of his countenance. It was days before be spoke, save in answer to questions addressed to him, or to give some order relative to his son's comfort. Delia's anxious heart foreboded only too truly, that the fiat had gone forth, and that her cousin's days on earth were numbered. Her resolution was taken at once; she would devote herself to him, and not only strive to lighten for him the shadowy path which leads down to the grave, but also to point out to him the Saviour's love, that it might unclose to him the dark portals of the mysterious tomb, and conduct him, a repentant and sanctified spirit, to the bosom of his Father and his God. In her own sickness and restoration to health, in her uncle's sad but most instructive history, in Mrs. Temple's life of holiness and devotion, and in the merciful, although afflictive event, which had smitten her cousin with an incurable yet lingering disease, she now was able to distinguish the hand of an all- wise and loving Parent. Doubts no longer oppressed her, and she was prepared and fitted, although she felt herself to be a mere beginner in the religious life and duties, to aid others, because she was ready and anxious to be taught herself. And, as in daily life our own energies are aroused and strengthened by efforts to assist those more feeble and more depend- ant than ourselves, so in spiritual experiences, our own faith is deepened and- established, and our reli- gious characters formed, by our endeavors to lead into the way of life everlasting, one who is groping along in moral darkness, with scarcely a ray of light to guide him.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      022A Fred was now able to pass many hours of the delightful June weather in the garden either in a chair, which could be wheeled at his pleasure, or reclining on one of the many broad benches which invited to repose under the shady trees, throughout the whole, extent of the grounds. By degrees, it came to be, that Delia was his -constant compan- ion. Mrs. Grafton, fully persuaded that her son was re- covering his health, relapsed into her former habits. Maria's natural indolence, as well as indifference of disposition, of course rendered her averse from con- fining herself to the care of her sick brother; and Clara, rejoicing in the freedom of country life, was not to be found at home for hours together. Delia felt that the first step to take, in the new position in which she found herself, was to win her cousin's confidence and affection; and here, young as she was, she felt how surely the consequences of omissions of duty follow us through every stage of life. What it would have been an easy thing for her to accomplish the past winter, had now become almost a hopeless undertaking; for Fred, suffering as he was both from debility of body and depression of spirits, was gloomy and often morose, repelling her kind advances with cold indifference or positive rude- ness. One day she had wheeled his chair to a bench about half way down the winding path, leading to the river's side, and as she was arranging the pillows and shawls, which were always taken out for him, she accidentally hit his arm. He uttered an exclamation of annoyance, and muttered something about wish- ing to be let alone. Delia was hurt, but she re-   Z;ZO     STEP BY STEI, - OR, strained her feelings, as far as possible. She could not, however, keep back the unbidden tears which filled her eyes. Fred saw she was pained by his impatience, and his conscience smote him. "You must excuse me, Delia," he said; "I know you are very kind, and I am ungrateful, but I do wish you would let me be, as the others do. I don't see, why you should trouble yourself about me."9 "It is no trouble to me, cousin Fred; I love to be with you, and I love to wait upon you; please let me." "I believe you," he said after a moment's pause; "although it puzzles me why you should care for such a poor-dog as I am, sow much more than any of my, own family. They don't concern themselves much about me." "They do care for you, Fred. There is nothing your father does not wish to have done for you, that will add to your comfort and happiness. Your mother has a good deal to attetid to, you know, and no one has as much leisure as I." "They show their interest in me in a strange fash- ion. There's Maria, this minute, with her everlasting novel, going to her chair, where she sits day after day reading. I never knew the time when my mother was not too busy to look after me. It's no use to talk about it, Delia, I never was of any consequence in the family, and never shall be. But I shan't trouble them long, that's certain; only they'll have to give up visiting a few months, I suppose; tha'll be bad, to be sure." Delia looked up grieved and astonished; her cousin spoke in such a reckless tone at first, and so sarcas-   -DELIA- ARLINGTON.     229 tically at last. He could, not, she thought, refer to the possibility or probability of his own death; but he did; for he presently added: "You know it's all a humbug about my getting well; I'm dying by inches; and I don't care; as well out of the world as in it, living as I have." "Oh, don't talk so, Fred, I beg of you; for you know, we all love you. Do you not see how changed your father is of late, and all because he is so anx- ious about you? And then how much you have to live for; you are so young and have good talents, and you might be so happy." "Well, well, I don't care for anything just now, but to be let alone, unless, indeed," he added, " you will tell me what has changed you so.. That puzzles me;  it can't be that fit of sickness you had." 4"No, not that alone, although that did a great deal for me; for it made me feel how dependent I am, and how little I can do for myself; but you know I told you, Fred, on a former occasion, that there is One mighty-to save. He has saved me, I trust; opened my eyes to my own sinfulness; and oh, cousin, He will save you too, if you will let Him.) If I am changed, dear cousin Fred, it is because I am trying to do His will. Will you not believe in His power to change you too, if you will but ask Him?" "I told you, Delia, that it was no use talking to me about such things. If there is anything real in relig- ion, two thirds of the world manage to live a merry life without it; and if I live, I reckon I shall do as well as my neighbors. If I die-- "Here he paused, evidently impressed by the thought of death. "Yes, think of that, Fred, if you die," said Delia earnestly. "How  can you go to your Father in 20   230      STEP BY STEP,---OR) Heaven to render in your account, feeling as you do now? Oh, think of these things before it is too late." "It is too late already. You might as well try to soften the hardest rock, you might as well-try to turn the Arctic Ocean into liquid fire, as to make any im- pression on me." "Oh, Fred, how can you talk so? you so young, too," and Delia burst into tears. "It is not, Delia, because I shouldn't like to feel as you do; for there does appear to be something real in your religion, but I cannot, my heart is numb, I think. I really don't care what becomes of me' here- after. I don't suppose it's my fault that I was brought up as I was, and I don't expect to be called to account for it. I rather think it will all come out right in the end; at any rate, I'm no worse off than thousands of others. Now let me go in and lie down, and don't let any one speak to me for three hours." "You are not vexed with me?" said Delia, helping him in his chair. "No, of course not. XWhat are you doing? you can't wheel me; call Thomas." "Yes I can; it is almost level; do let me, and I want to ask a favor of you; may I?" "I Ask awry." "Will you not have Thomas wheel you down to my seat by the river side every pleasant day, and let me read to you there, if it is only for ten minutes? It is very quiet and pleasant." "' Yes, I don't care; anything you like. I can go to sleep while you read, that's one comfort." Ungracious as this permission was, Delia gladly   DELIA ARLINGTON.      231 availed herself of it, and day after day of those bright summer months, that were fleeting on- so rapidly, bearing every moment the one cousin nearer, and still nearer, to the eternity he had spoken lightly of, and giving to the other new and rich experience of Divine love and power, found them quietly located in the little nook at the river's side, Here, where the waters sparkled and played at their very feet, and the birds sang their fullest notes of rejoicing and praise, all nature seemed in harmony with God, and aided Delia in her heaven-given min- istry of love. Fred soon became as much attached to the spot as she had ever been, and after a short time, his indifferent manner, whenever she read to him, changed to one of interest, and the comforting words of a Saviour's love, and the holy chants of pious souls, seemed to have a force and beauty to him, as read and repeated by his cousin, amid such surround- ings, which scarcely belonged to them any where else.    232      STEP BY STEP,-- OR CHAPTER XXI. "Ev'ry state, Allotted to the race of man below, Is in proportion doomed to taste some sorrow." "AND is this really Delia Arlington's very self? Why I took you for a spirit, as we drove up the ave- nme, with your white robe and etherial figure. I thought, perhaps, Judge Grafton had engaged one for the season to give eclat to his country seat." Thus was Delia addressed by a familiar voice, as she was slowly walking one day, in one of the paths of the flower garden, and at the same time a pair of arms encircled her slender waist lovingly. She turned to greet and embrace Adie Lawton. "Where did you drop from, Adie? This is, indeed, a surprise." "Not from the skies, as you really look as though you did," replied Adie gazing earnestly into her friend's face, as she spoke. "I was right at first; you are a spirit, after all, in Delia's shape. You know, to quote poetry a la Danforth, Milton says: 'Spirits when they please Can either sex assume or both; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure.'" * "Nevertheless," replied Delia laughing, "I am no spirit, but the self-same Delia, who sat near you at school last winter." ' That's not honest in you, Delia; you are not the same," -replied Adie bluntly. "What has chanced to you, that you droop your haughty head like the -  .;l   DELIA ARLINGTON.      233 lily of the valley? And whither have those queenly looks departed? Are you under iron rule, or what is it? Yet you don't look unhappy, either." "Oh, don't analyze my face and manner, Adie, as if I was a botanical specimen, pray don't," replied Delia, half laughing, half confused, for in her friend's present mood she did not care to enter upon the causes which really had changed her appearance; "but gratify my curiosity, and tell me how and when you came here." "In the most matter-of-fact way possible, straight from Y  , my father's country seat; that is, as straight as the road would bring us; drawn by two horses in a carriage, driven by that venerable patriarch of coachmen, Cato Williams. Now if there's a quiet spot to take one to, we'll sit down and have a good chat together, and you shall tell me what you've been doing in this out-of-the-world place, and I'll give you in return the very last chapter on New York fashions, pomp, et cetera." "Spare me that, I pray," said Delia, holding up both hands, deprecatingly, " and tell me instead first ; how your mother is, and if you have seen Helen Temple lately," "To query first, my mother is as well as could be expected, after the fatigue of moving, &c. To query second, thereby hangs a tale. The Temples are coming up to make us a visit. What do you say to that?" "That I am very glad to hear it, and should like to know how it happened." "My mother, you know, never rests until she estab- lishes some sort of claim upon any person or persons she chances to hear of, who are less fortunate than 20*   234      STEP BY STEP, --OR, herself. The interest you took in Helen extended to me, you know, and of course my mother only needed to be told about Mrs. Temple and her daughter, to have her interest excited also. Upon inquiry of a lady who knew all about her early history, she dis- covered that they had been school girls together. Forthwith I was deputed with one of my mother's irresistible notes to her, as ambassadress extraordinary to negotiate terms for a renewal of friendship between them. The result was, she came to see my mother, and the result of that was an invitation to visit us at T---, which was accepted. Mother tried to induce her to take up her abode with us altogether this sum- mer, and teach me certain indispensable branches of education; but thioking, I suppose, that it was done for her benefit and not on account of any special need of mine, she wisely declined. It seems that her in- comparable son, that paragon of paragons, Melville, has obtained a very eligible situation in Boston, through the influence of an old friend of his mother's, and Helen is to be installed teacher of music and drawing in Mrs. Dennett's school the coming winter; so their star is evidently in the ascendant just now. I'm thankful for it, too, for Mrs. Temple is one of the sweetest women I ever saw. How she's managed to live in poverty so long, subject to the caprices of fine ladies, and neither lose her refinement nor independ- ence of character puzzles me. She must have been a noble woman to begin with." "That's not the secret of her beautiful character, Adie, half so much as the fact that all this time she. has been a true practical Christian." "How do you know that? Did she tell you?. She's not one to boast of her goodness?'   DELIA ARLINGTON.      235 "No, indeed, but my uncle, who knew her well when she was a young lady, although I was totally ignorant of it until my sickness last spring, told me all about her." "I understand it all now. Mrs. Lee, the lady who told mother about her, said she met with a disap- pointment in early life, which softened and beautified her character. But, Delia, do you know what I am here for?"A "To see me, I hope." "Yes, to be sure, but I come commissioned with orders, invitations, prayers, what you will, from head quarters; otherwise my mother, tha't you should come to Y   and spend the summer and a day with us, or in other words, come and make us as long a visit as you can."?' "I cannot, Adie; I cannot leave my cousin." "Who, Fred?" "Yes." "Isn't he better? Clara told me he was a few days ago, when I met her in the city." "No, he is not 'better, Adie, and he never will be. My aunt and cousins do not understand his con- dition.", 4"Still if he is sick, it is their' duty and not yours to take care of him. Why should you be tied to that wilful boy?" "Hush, do not speak so, Adie. He is changed, very much changed; and besides, he is dependent on me. I will go to you for a day, but while he lives I cannot leave him for a longer time." "Mystery upon' mystery. I thought you didn't like your cousin last winter. Well, well, say no more about it, Delia; none so blind as those who   236      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, will not see. I know now what has changed you so, and I hope some day I shall become good enough to give up my dearest pleasures for duty's sake." , "Do not give me the credit I do not deserve, Adie. It is the greatest pleasure I have to be with him. If you could see how he is changed these last few weeks, how patient and gentle he is, and how he loves to listen to me when I read to him, you- -" "Yes, but who has brought him into this state?" "The mercy of God, Adie. I have done what I could. I owed him some reparation for last winter's neglect." 4"Yes, so you view your duties. I wish my con- science was as active as yours. Indeed, Delia, I am not worthy to be your friend." "Do not pain me by talking so, Adie. - If you only knew how much I have to contend with." "And the thing is, you are contending with those feelings that would lead you astray, while H" While, you, dear friend, will surely before long follow your mother's example, I trust." "It may be so, I know ebot. But tell me what day will you come? The Temples come up Monday." "Say Wednesday week, if convenient to you." "Wednesday week it is. I will come for you." She was hastening away, when Mary made her ap- pearance with Herbert. "Ah, darlingest of Herby's," said Adie, springing forward and catching him up, ( I shall take you home with me." "No, no," said the child, struggling in her arms; "Herby don't want go home with Miss Adie; Herby stay here with tozen Dele." "Tozen Dele forever. What a stanch little knight   DEILIA ARLINGTON.      237 you are, to be sure. Well, one kiss, Herby," and Adie hastened away to the carriage. 4 Now, Williams, here I am, so please annihilate space and time as rapidly as may be,-in other words, take mne home at once." ' To be sure, Miss, that's what I bin waitin' for all this time, and noffin else," said the venerable darkey, grinning complacently at the young lady, whom he had tossed in his arms many a time, when she was a little picaninny, as he often boasted to his fellow servants. Leaning back in the carriage as it rolled along at a rapid speed, the volatile girl's countenance assumed a serious expression, and her thoughts were very much the following: "How changed Delia is. I once thought those lines of pride, and that haughty carriage of the head ineffaceable characteristics of Delia Arlington; but now she is so different. How sweet, yet sad, is the expression of her face; not the sadness, however, that comes of a heart ill at ease with itself. Her sadness must be on 'account of her cousin. For herself, she surely has found that peace which passeth under- standing, and is already living a life worthy of her noble nature; while I,- I who despise frivolity, and the miserable ways of the fashionable world,-am living as I dp, with the example of my honored and adored mother constantly before me. Alas! I Can- not resolve to do differently, at least, not yet, not yet." On the appointed day, Adie came for her friend. On their arrival at Woodlawn, Delia had scarcely time to receive the cordial welcome of her kind friends, before Adie carried her off for a stroll though   238      STEP BY STEP,--OR, the grounds, which were less highly cultivated, but more extensive than Judge Grafton's. "There," said she, as soon as they were fairly out of sight of the house, "I was determined to have a good talk with you before my elders got possession.' "But I want you to do the talking, Adie; I wish to hear about our schoolmates." "Oh, when the term closed, they were all progress- ing in the march of mindj each after her own fashion, and now they are scattered here and there and every- where; some at Newport, some at Saratoga, some to their homes on this river, and some to quiet nooks back in the country. Among them all there is not one whom you would care to hear more about, unless it be Elenor Thompson, who, I verily believe, has more in her than most people see. She has really persuaded her mother to let her rusticate in a country clergyman's family, (some connection, I believe,) in- stead of going to a fashionable watering place; and the last time I saw her she was actually rejoicing in the prospect of sporting plain lawns and ginghams in lieu of the silks, fancy dresses and furbelows, she would have been required to wear, if she had gone with her mother." "I was sure she had more character than you sup- posed. We shall hear of her yet, I have no doubt. But now, Adie, do tell me about the Carters." "Oh, yes, I meant to the other day, but somehow I didn't say half I wanted to. There is another of my mother's good deeds to come to light. I shall tell you all about it. You know Mr. Carter was very anxious to get back here to Y ,where lie formerly lived, as, poor man, his much desired city life proved so bad an experiment for him. Well, my mother   ';   DELIA ARLINGTON.      239 persuaded father to let him one of his cottages at such a reasonable rate, that he could easily pay the rent, and then she assisted them in moving; now they are comfortably settled only five minutes' walk from our gates. Mother thought it was time for Susy Carter to be at school, so she engaged a poor seamstress she is interested in, to go there and work for her board, thus enabling Susy to leave her grandmother, who is more helpless than ever. We will go to see them if you like. Susy says, they owe everything to you, and Mrs. Rawson says,' yes, under God, we do.' Mr. Carter and Susy will be at home now at dinner; shall we go there?" "I should'like to very much; I have not seen them for months." The two girls were soon at the little cottage gate, where they met Mr. Carter just going out. He ex- tended his rough horny hand with evident pleasure to Delia, who warmly returned the honest grasp. "Glad to see you, Miss, in these parts. I was afeered last spring, when I -heerd how sick you was, may be you'd never get about agin, but the Lord has been marciful to you as well as to me. He raised up this old body for me, and He has gin you new life too. If I might be so bold, Miss, as to say it, you don't feel just like as you did last winter! There's a look in your young face like old gran marm's, when she says, 'I'm content.'" "I am much happier now than I was last winter, Mr. Carter, and have learned something from sick- ness, I trust, as you yourself have." "Jest so, jest so, Miss. God's ways aint like our'n. It's wonderful how He makes blessin's come out of grevus trials. I can say it's good for me that I've been afflicted."   240     STEP BY STEP,-- OR, "Shall I go in and see Mrs. Rawson?" "Yes, yes, Miss, do, she'll be right glad to see you. You must skuse me. Thank the Lord, I'm not an idle man now."9 The girls entered, and were gladly received by Mrs. Rawson, who now seldom left her chair. Susan came in from the little porch neat and smiling to welcome Delia, and the other little Carters put itn their heads at the door to see the good young lady whom they had been taught to regard a true friend. The visit was a most satisfactory one to Delia, and she left that humble abode rejoicing, that she had listened to the promptings of her kind and generous heart, on the day she met Susan in the street. Adie hastened Delia home, saying her mother would be impatient, and took her immediately to Mrs. Lawton's pleasant chamber, which was, as in the city, the favorite gathering place of the family and intimate friends. The window commanded a fine view of the river, and of the palisades oppo- site, and as Delia looked admiringly out upon the beautiful and varied prospect, she involuntarily ex- claimed : "' God made the country, man made the town."'  "But God made man himself after his own like- ness, and in his own image," said Mrs. Lawton in reply, " so man's works are indirectly God's works, and not to be despised, my dear young lady." "Oh no, Ma'am, I didn't mean that, only it seems to me as- if one is so much happier in the free and open country than in the city, with no brick walls to shut out the sun, air, sky, and water; and surely there is nothing in the city to compare with that   DELIA ARLINGTON,       241 noble wall of God's pwn fashioning," pointing as she spoke to the palisades, which there rose in an almost unbroken front to the height of more than a hundred and fifty feet. "For mere enjoyment, I grant your country life is preferable to the city, that is, selfish enjoyment, the external pleasure of having one's senses ministered to; but then the city presents a far wider field of usefulness; and to those whom God has made stew- ards of a large portion of this world's goods, a more desirable, or rather a fitter place of abode, since there, those whom duty requires us to care for, are for the most part foun'd." "Oh, dear, duty, duty, mother, is always the bur- den of your song. If God intended us for nothing but duty, I wonder why He made so many things that have no real use, but are mere luxuries." "I did not say we are to have no pleasures, my child, no recreations; but at the same time, I am quite certain that every true Christian finds his or her chief enjoyments in the performance of that, to you, same bughear duty. Is it not so, Mrs. Tem- ple?"! "Such has been my experience most surely," was the reply. "We are to enjoy the blessings God has given us in a thankful spirit," added Mrs. Lawton, " but not in a selfish one. As a matter of individual taste or per- sonal preference, I should choose the country the year round, for it has indescribable charms for me, even in the season of frost and snow, but it would be im- practicable for me in this quiet retreat to know of the suffering and want that is every week coming under my notice in the city, and appealing to me for relief; 21   4-      STEP BY STEP, -- OR, and as we surely are our brother's keeper, we have no right to remove ourselves beyond the sound of his voice, when it is lifted up in distress. "Beside, we, who owe our prosperity to the noble city of New York, should not turn away from her to bury ourselves in idle luxury, when her thousands of poor are crying out for bread to eat. Rather let us pay our indebtedness to her in aiding to feed her own hungry, and the starving thousands of immigrants flocking to her every year for food and protection. I like to feel when I leave the city, in the beautiful summer season, that, at least, there is no fellow being there shivering with cold, whom I might have made warm, and that I have earned a little rest by doing what I could in what seems to me the way of my appointed duty in the inclement wintry months." "Why, mother, I never knew before, why you were so unwilling to leave New York altogether, when father wished it too." "Your father, my daughter, had no very strong preferences for country life, and was very willing to remain in the city for the winter, when he understood my reasons for it; and he is quite of my opinion now, since poverty and suffering have increased so much among us within the last few years. It may seem almost absurd to you, Mrs. Temple, to hear me talk in this way, knowing as you do, that I seldom leave my room from month to month. I Nevertheless, I am not out of the hearing of calls, as I should be here in the country." Mrs. Temple smiled and said: "I doubt if even here you would be out of the hearing of calls of ne- cessity, as you appear to have some mysterious way   DELIA ARLINGTON,      243 of finding out those who are in need of assistance; but H agree with you in your reasons for residing so large a portion of the year in the city." "But;" said Delia timidly, " there is one aspect of city life in which it does not appear to so great ad- vantage." "To what do you refer, my dear?" asked Mrs. Lawton. "The habits of the wealthy in indulging in fash- ion, frivolity and extravagance. We almost imper- ceptibly imbibe the tastes, and imitate the customs of those by whom we are surrounded, particularly if we ourselves have naturally such tastes and inclina- tions; it seems to me the safer course to keep away from such temptations." "As, for instance, Miss Delia Arlington," broke in the incorrigible Adie, "after residing some nine months under the roof of the Hon. Judge Grafton, and enjoying all the advantages to be derived there- from, is about to make her debut in society as a polished young lady of fashion, who plays divinely, waltzes charming, converses absurdly, et cetera, et cetera. Yes, Delia's self proves her argument." "Hush, hush, my child," said Mrs. Lawton, scarce- ly able to restrain a smile at the vivacity of her daughter, "that too voluble tongue of yours, makes itself more free, I fear, than is always quite proper. But to reply to your remark, Delia; safer perhaps it would be, but scarcely so noble. We should never expose ourselves needlessly to temptations, any more than we should recklessly put ourselves in the way of a contagious disease; but if in that sphere of life, in which Providence has placed   us, we meet with temptations, it is our duty bravely to bear up against   244      STEP BY STEP,--OR, them. It would be cowardly to pursue any other course. And yet the great heart of humanity in New York beats truly and steadily, notwithstanding what the eye of the careless observer sees, ever vibrating to the chord once and forever touched by the hand of the world's Redeemer. Depend upon it, my dear young friends, it is not city or country life, which makes or mars the character; and if the city abounds in temptations and snares which endanger the safety of the unwary, it also abounds in golden opportuni- ties for ennobling the character, and purifying the heart, refining it, perchance, to the fineness of fine gold, although it be through much tribulation and anguish. The result, however, is the same; on the one side, life devoted to life's great end, and on the other, a fellow creature saved and redeemed." Mrs. Lawton spoke so earnestly, that she quite as- tonished Delia. She had never seen her so interested before, and, indeed, it was seldom that she was so much carried away by any subject, as to lay aside, as she did' on this occasion, her natural reserve of character. After dinner Delia retired with Mrs. Temple and Helen to their own room, and made known to them her trials, struggles, and victories, during the last few weeks. Mrs. Temple was rejoiced to find, that she was gradually attaining to that state of rest and peace in which the grace of God works in fulfilment of His holy purposes in the Christian believer's heart, and it was no less a gratification to her to be inform- ed of the influence Delia had acquired over her cousin. She cheered and encouraged the heart of her young friend by assuring her, that she had good reason to hope that her cousin would become all she   DELIA ARLINGTON,      245 could wish, ere the dread summons should remove him beyond her Christian interest. Before the sun went down, Delia returned to her self-imposed duties, invigorated, hopeful, and wiser than she had left them in the morning. 21* t^   JSTEP BYtrr     S Y E -- UK, CHAPTER XXII. "D Down goes the sun! But the soul of one, Who by repentance Has escaped the dreadful sentence, Shines bright below me as I look. It is the end!"    LONGFELLOW. MRS. LAWTON'S remark, that wherever people are situated, whether in the city or in the country, they always find opportunities for indulging their favorite tastes, and following their favorite pursuits, was fully verified in Judge Grafton's family. Mrs. Grafton and her daughters passed the summer, for the most part, in visiting their fashionable neighbors, going upon pleasure excursions, receiving and entertaining guests with tastes and habits much like their own, and making an occasional trip to some fashionable water- ing place. The social and domestic duties had scarcely any existence except in name; and as for religion, the family might as well have been heathen as Christian, so far as any apparent observance of its requirements was concerned. True the handsome carriage, so per- fect in all its appointments, conveyed the family once every pleasant Sunday to the village church; but for what object and from what motives they went, the Eye that seeeth into the heart best knew; for com- pany to dinner, playing on the piano, and idle con- versation usually finished the day, which appeared to wear heavily away alike with the mother and daughters.   In the meantime Delia was as differently occupied, as her tastes, feelings, and principles, were different from those of her aunt and cousins. Religiously brought up, the Sabbath had ever been a sacred day to her, even before she had learned, by the change that had been wrought within her, to value its privi- leges as she did now. She always walked to church in the morning, returning with the family. The afternoons and evenings she devoted to Fred, until his early hour for retiring. During the week she had her regular studies, and occupations for such hours as were not devoted to her cousin; ready, at any moment, however, to leave them, if she could be of any service to him; for the work, commenced in pity and from a sense of duty, had now become a labor of love. She had her recre- ations also; for she now, more than ever, felt it to be a duty to take care of her own health. An hour's solitary stroll, by the river's side or among the hills, in which she indulged daily, greatly refreshed and strengthened her, while a frolic with little Herbert enlivened her spirits.            * It is not to be' supposed, that Delia, with her natural characteristics of haughty self-reliance, and independence of action, had attained to perfection. By no means. She felt herself to be very far from it. Her rebellious and excitable feelings were now, as of old, not unfrequently aroused within her, either by some idle taunt of her cousins, or by some one or other of the many little vexations so trying to the mildest temper, from which no one is exempt. But at the same time, there was a positive, and to her own consciousness, a very marked difference between her former and present self. She felt no   248      STEP BY STEP,--OR, longer sufficient unto herself, and when tried, as of old, she sought aid from Him, from whom aid cometh, and looked to Him for strength in whom strength can be found; and not in vain. In all these days of attending upon the sick, Delia saw very little either of her aunt or cousins. Mrs. Grafton, blind to her son's actual condition, chose to consider him and probably did consider him, slowly recovering, and satisfied herself on the score of duty by making two visits daily to his sick room, and giving Mrs. Hosmer unlimited orders to attend to his comfort and wants. Seeing that he was happy with his cousin, she very readily gave up to her the principal care of him, without seeming to reflect whether it might be a pleasure or a task to her niece. Delia was not much surprised either at her aunt's or cousins' indifference with regard to Fred, but the conduct of Judge Grafton towards him was a great mystery to her. She was well convinced, that he knew his son was passing away, and yet he kept -aloof from him as much as possible; aloof, and yet evidently watching over him. Contrary to his usual custom, heretofore, as her aunt had once or twice remarked in Delia's hearing, he now came up from the city in the early afternoon boat, and was always abroad in his grounds in the cool of the day at the time Fred was in the garden. Wherever the invalid and his attendant were, he was never far off, but sel- dom approached within speaking distance. Delia also observed, that he always returned to the house immediately after his son did, whatever hour it might be, and was rarely seen again for the day, unless visitors came in. Outwardly, he was very much the   DELIA ARLINGTON.      249 same, as rigid, as punctilious as ever in the observ- ance of forms and ceremonies, yet not altogether the same; for the quick-sighted girl fancied she could detect, occasionally, symptoms of uneasiness, and at times she felt that his manner towards her was changed, but how she scarcely knew, for he rarely addressed her, save in the common courtesies of the table. Often she pondered over his mysterious con- duct, but never with a very satisfactory result. How could she, the innocent, unworldly girl of scarcely fifteen summers, fathom the motives of a man, who had so hedged himself round with stiff formalities, and so wrought his very nature into miserable conventionalisms, that he found it almost impossible to break away from the restraints with which they bound him. Little knew she, of the hours of agony, during which the self-controlled model gentleman, paced his room, longing to break the reserve which kept him and his son at a distance from each other, that he might tell that son all the yearnings of a father's heart for him. Judge Grafton had always loved his children with a love far deeper than the weak, unstable nature of his wife was capable of. He had been proud of them, likewise; and now both his pride and his love were about to receive a terrible shock. How a man, possessed of such depth of feeling, could ever have become so enslaved to the world and its follies, is to be accounted for in part, by the fact, that with a disposition naturally arrogant and' self- important, he was early taught by a fond, weak mother to aim, above all things, at becoming a finished gentleman; never once considering, for, poor woman, she did not know, that the only true gentleman is the sincere, humble and devout Christian.   250      STEP BY STEP, --OR, As matters were, one thing Delia was resolved upon, and that was, to bring father and son into an understanding with each other, which she was sure would add to the happiness of both. It was now late in August, and as in nature there were unmistakable signs of that decay and death, in which all things that the eye rested upon would be involved, so Delia thought she could discover indica- tions that her cousin's life was waning to its close. The brilliant hectic on his cheek, and the unnatural fire of his eye, although concealing from the careless observer the ravages of disease, did not deceive her. Perceiving that his strength was evidently declin- ing daily, she ventured one day to hint to her aunt that such was the case, for she could not bear any longer to hear that self-deceived mother making plans for the future, just as though no affliction was im- pending over her. Mrs. Grafton was unwilling tO believe at first, that her son was not actually im- proving; but when Mrs. Hosmer confirmed what Delia had told her about him, she began to be alarmed, and went immediately to consult her hus- band, who then made known to her Dr. Hilton's opinion. The first effect of such intelligence was of course a violent fit of hysterics. After that had passed away, she still refused to believe Fred was actually in so alarming a state as had been represented, and persuaded herself that a trip South, when the cold weather began to set in, and perhaps a winter's resi- dence in a warm climate, would result in his complete recovery. She, however, after this, devoted rather more of her time than formerly to him, at least for a little while; but as he seemed from day to day   DELIA ARLINGTON.       251 about the same, certainly no worse, and as Delia still continued her attentions, she soon relapsed into her old habits. It was truly beautiful to witness the young girl's devotedness to her cousin. She never allowed herself to be discouraged by his fretfulness or impatience. At last, as it has been stated, he began to be inter- ested in what she read, and finally was oftentimes very much-affected by passages, which seemed pecu- liarly appropriate to his condition. Latterly, although he always listened with the greatest attention, he had made no remarks; the reason was, as Delia inferred from his manner and countenance, he was engaged in some great struggle with himself. At such times, she felt that she could only remain silent, and in the secret chamber of her own heart pray for him, that he might come off victorious, and find a blessed deliverance out of the thraldom which still bound his spirit. As yet he had never made any allusion either to his own past folly and sin, or his present feelings. But her devoted labors were not in vain; neither was that glorious summer lost to the sick young man. It seemed, as if nature had never been more prodigal in adorning herself in robes of brilliant beauty. Frequent showers at night, and the rich warm sunshine by day, had brought the whole veget- able world into a state of most luxurious growth; and wherever the eye rested, it beheld new forms of loveliness. The invalid, with his naturally susceptible heart, was not unaffected by the softening and purifying influences that surrounded him; neither was he un- affected by Delia's interest in him. He was well   252      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, persuaded now, that there was a reality in religion, because he saw the results of its divine working in his cousin's character; and his one earnest desire was to have a convincing evidence of it in his own heart, and become a sharer with her in its joys and hopes. One lovely Sabbath afternoon, the last of the sum- mer, Thomas, at his request, wheeled Fred down to the river's side, to Delia's favorite retreat; she, as usual, accompanying him. After Thomas had as- sisted in arranging the seat, and had placed him upon it, he turned to leave them; when Fred called to him in a gentle voice, and thanked him for his kind attentions. This was something so unusual and so unexpected, the poor fellow was so much affected by it, that he could make no answer, and hurried abruptly away. For a few minutes the two were silent. At last Fred said: "This is my last visit, Delia, to this spot. I hardly felt able to come to-day, but I wanted one more view of the river, one more look at Cape Hope. It was well named, this little spot; here I have found hope for the future; and it is you, Delia, whom I am to thank for it." "Do not thank me, dear cousin, for the little I have done. If I have helped you in the least, it has been returned to my own spirit tenfold. But I trust you will come here many times yet." "No, no; my weary body longs for rest, and my immortal spirit craves a higher life. Oh, Delia, do you think I am forgiven? I feel that I am; that the Saviour is my Saviour, and that God is my Father; but may it not be a delusion, I am so unworthy?" "Christ died for sinners, dear Fred. If you feel   DELIA ARLINGTON.      253 your unworthiness, I suppose that is repentance. If you will only see the pastor of the village church, he could give you so much more comfort than I can; he is such a good man." "He couldn't give me more comfort than you have, Delia; but I will see him some time; I should like to. Now repeat to me the 'Lord is my shepherd.' I never tire hearing that beautiful psalm." "Yes," he murmured, as her soft low accents fell upon his ear in sweetest harmony with the rippling waves at their feet, upon which he was gazing,- "Yes, 'beside the still waters;' how beautiful, how refreshing to a weary spirit like mine; and how sus- taining the thought, that there is One who will be my guide and stay through the dark valley. How I used to shudder at the thought of death! How he seems to me like a kind friend now!" He was silent, and Delia opened her Bible ta the fourteenth chapter of St. John's Gospel, which she read aloud, and never did its comforting words sound more divine than as they fell from her lips. "' In my Father's house are many mansions,"' he repeated, after she had concluded, " mansions for the repentant sinner as well as for the holy saint; and the Comforter, whom the Saviour promised,--yes, he has sent him to me. And yet I do not feel my- self worthy to have received such blessings. Oh, Delia, Delia; to think of a wasted life,- worse than wasted, misspent! and I had no excuse. I knew I was doing wrong all the while, but I had not the resolution to do right, or rather I did not want to do right. I almost delighted in evil, knowing it to be evil; I was so dissatisfied with myself and every body else; and now " 22  254     STEP BY STEP,--OR, "And now God has accepted and pardoned you. Do not think of the past so sadly." "I strive not to, but bitter thoughts will come over me at times, when I remember the innocent days of my boyhood. Mrs. Hosmer used to teach me hymns then, and I took great delight in repeating them. How good she was, and how kind you have been to me, Delia. I should not feel as I do now, had it not been for your patience and kindness." "Do not speak of it, Fred. It has been a great pleasure to me to minister to your comfort and hap- piness; but, dear cousin, will you not talk with your friends?" st How can I?" he answered almost impatiently, "when it is only now that I have been able to talk with you? My mother would not understand 'my feelings; my sisters surely could not." "But your father, I am sure he would gladly talk with you, if you would only be open with him." "My father does not love me, Delia. He is as cold and unapproachable as he always has been since my recollection." "In manner, perhaps, but certainly not in heart. You do not wish to die, dear Fred, with estranged feelings towards your father," said Delia, trembling as she spoke. "I am not estranged from him, Delia." "Neither is he estranged from you, my son," said a voice so indistinct in its utterance, that but for the words spoken, neither Delia nor Fred would have recognized it as Judge Grafton's. But there be stood, his face deadly pale, and every line of sternness changed into intense grief. "Father," was all the son could say, as he extended   DELIA ARLINGTON.      255 his hot, wasted hand, which was convulsively grasped and retained. Delia felt that such an interview was too sacred for witnesses, and saying to herself, ( Put off thy shoes from thy feet, for this is holy ground," she silently withdrew, and taking the rough path that led to Cape Hope, went where she could see father and son, and at the same time be out of the hearing of their voices. - As she stood on the very verge of the rocky headland, and looked upon the beautiful river gliding so, smoothly along its destined way, she uttered a prayer that even thus peacefully might her repentant cousin's spirit leave its earthly tenement. And for herself, as she contrasted her feelings now with what they were the day she conversed with Mrs. Temple in sight of the very spot on which she was standing, her heart swelled in devout gratitude to Him who had so graciously opened the eyes of her understanding and given her peace. In the meanwhile Judge Grafton, for the first time, perhaps, in his life, forgot himself and his consequence so entirely, as to express to his son the deep feelings of his heart. Fred listened in the deepest attention, profoundly astonished to find that the parent, whom from boyhood he had feared far more than he had loved, and whom, since that fatal night in the city, he had regarded as an enemy rather than a friend, had all the while loved him fondly. The fountain of feeling which had so long been pent up, now that it had found vent, took free course, and- the penitent- father 'told the son all that he had suffered during his sickness. He told him how he had striven to repress his feelings, and with what suc-   256     STEP BY STEP,-OR, cess. He told him of the anxious days and sleepless nights he had passed on his account, and how the doctor's opinion of his condition, which he had almost forced from the good man, had been only too true a fulfilment of his own fears from the beginning; how since that time, whether absent or present, he had been ever in his thoughts, and how he had watched over him when he little knew hewas near. And he attempted to tell him of the agony of remorse he had suffered in remembering his unfulfilled duties as a parent. But here Fred entreated him to stop, saying: 'a Do not speak of that, father, I beseech you, now that I know you love me and forgive me, and now too that I feel that I am accepted of my Heavenly Father, redeemed through Christ my Saviour. I am happy, too happy in consequence of the change in my feelings to wish to remain longer on earth, and the strongest desire of my heart is to go where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. But, oh, father, will you not when I am gone, seek comfort where I have found it. When I left you that terrible night, I disobeyed your commands and came here; my heart was full of wickedness and sin. I blamed you and my mother, and even God himself for my own voluntary acts of transgression. I was ready to die, and even wished I might; I did not care for life, nor had any fear with regard to the future, - indeed, I scarcely believed that there was a future. But now everything is so changed. I see my past folly and iniquity, and sincerely and bitterly have I repented of it. But I have no wish to recover, -no wish to return to life, and its struggles and temptations. I know what they are. Oh, father, I have been a wayward, sinful boy. I see my life now   DELIA ARLINGTON.      257 as it has been, and seeing it as I do, I once more beg you to seek comfort and peace of mind where I have found it. Wil you not, father?" "I will, my son; by the help of God, I will strive to do so." "Take me home, father, I am content. I shall never come here again, never. Where is Delia?," Judging from their manner that they were looking for her, Delia immediately came to them. Fred took her hand and placing it in his fathers, said, "She will show you the way," and became insensible. Judge Grafton took him in his arms, and bore him to the house, and laid him on his bed. The agitating interview with his father had been too much for his failing strength, and, for hours the whole family were in that fearful state of suspense, which checks the pulse and pales the cheek of the most thought- less, uncertain whether each breath the sufferer drew would be his last. But God was merciful, and vouchsafed to the grief-stricken parent an opportunity to soothe the last moments of his son's life. In a few hours, Doctor Hilton pronounced all immediate danger over, and Fred slept the heavy sleep of exhaustion. The few remaining days of the young man's life were peaceful and happy. Nothing was allowed to enter that room, over which the angel of death hov- ered, that was not in harmony with its quietness and serenity. Judge Grafton, to outward appearance at least, left his grief and remorse in his own private apartment, which had so long been the Gethsemane of his agony; and his stern authority kept his wife's. ill-governed feelings in check in her son's presence, never allowing her to enter his sick chamber unless 22*   258      STEP BY STEP,--OR, she was calm. Out of it, however, she kept the whole household in disorder by her violent hysteric fits, and her utter inability to atteno to -her family affairs. Everything of consequence devolved on Mrs. Hosmer and Delia, who showed their interest in the invalid by their persevering efforts to maintain order and quiet, and provide whatever might be needed for his comfort. Maria and Clara were softened by their knowledge of their brother's condition, but were of little service to any one. Mrs. Hosmer claimed the privilege of taking care of the sick, while the family assembled at their sad and unceremonious meals. Mr. Parsons, the minister of the village church, came every day to read and pray with the dying young man; and though the latter seldom spoke, it was evident that the good man's visits gratified him, as they also seemed to impress Judge Grafton. Delia, when not otherwise engaged, was always near at 'hand to read or repeat hymns to her cousin, but she forebore to intrude uncalled into the presence of father and son, for Judge Grafton now was seldom absent from the sick room.   DELIA ARLINGTON.       259 CHAPTER XXIII. "O death, what art thou? a stern and silent usher, Leading to the judgment for Eternity, after the trial scene of time; O Death, what art thou? an husbandman, that reapeth always, Out of season, as in season, with the sickle in his hands." TUPPER. IT was a glorious September morning. The sun's rich beams were spreading their effulgence over all nature, just beginning to be arrayed in her gorgeous autumnal robes, which betoken speedy decay and death. Within that mansion of wealth and pride, in which so many weeks of anxious watchings, of hopes and fears had been passed, the voice of sup- pressed lamentation was heard. The hour had at last come, when it was evident to all, that the golden cord must be severed that had bound an immortal spirit to its tabernacle of clay. Nor riches, nor pride, nor elevated station can avert thy stroke, O death. Thou comest, mysterious visit- ant, at the mandate of Him, who controlleth alike the sparrow's fall and the destiny of the loftiest of earth's sovereigns. But since " the Lord has risen indeed," "where, O death, is thy sting, and where, O grave, thy victory?"Thou but takest the world-tried, and, it may be, tempest-tossed spirit to the presence of its Maker, who is alike the tender Father, and the mer- ciful and just Judge, and with whom we may dare in faith and love to leave those nearest and dearest to us. All night long the dying son had been in such agonizing distress, that his father fervently prayed   260      STEP BY STEP,-- OR,' each breath might be his last, much as he desired once more to hear the sound of his voice. He had appeared to be insensible to everything but his own sufferings. No answering look, or motion even, re- plied to the words occasionally addressed to him by the anxious and distressed watchers around his bed. About an hour after sunrise, however, he appeared somewhat relieved, moved uneasily upon his pillow, and opening his eyes looked up into his father's face, and said: "Where am I, father?" "Still with us, my son," was the answer in a sub- dued and trembling voice. I Oh, I had such a pleasant dream; and only a few moments since. I thought I was walking with the Good Shepherd in the green pastures and beside the still waters, and although I was faint and feeble, his right arm upheld me. As we journeyed on together, I thought I saw before us a choir of bright angels leading the way and singing, oh, with such tones of gladness, ' There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.' Then I awoke, but, father, I hear the music still." And he raised his eyes with a look, which surely must have been caught from that heaven into which he was so soon to enter. He now lay for a few minutes as if in quiet sleep. There was a hushed silence in the room, in which the whole family were gathered, and, excepting the stifled sobs of Mrs. Grafton, which she could not wholly control, no sound was heard. Presently opening his eyes again, he said: "Mother, do not weep for me, I so long to be at rest. Sisters, do not, as I have done, put off the ser- vice of the Lord to a sick bed. Father, little Herbert   DELIA ARLINGTON.      261 will soon be to you more than I ever could have been." These sentences were uttered at intervals and in a broken voice, as he could command strength and breath to speak. "Thank you all," he resumed again after a con- siderable pause, " all for your kindness to me. Delia, to you I owe this peace. 'My peace I give unto you!' The Lord has spoken it, and it is true. Repeat to me the hymn, ' When I can read my title clear.'" Delia in a low but steady voice complied with his request. Slowly and faintly, as with a last effort, he repeated after her,-- "May I but safely reach my God, my heaven, my all." After another pause, he said: "Father, let me look at the rising sun once more." The blinds were thrown open, and through the window which faced the east, a flood of light poured into the room and fell upon the wan, but now surely glorified face of the dying youth. "It is glorious; oh, it is glorious! Hark!--I hear --the music again,- I see the angels. I come-- Lord Jesus, -I - come." Not an audible sound escaped from any one of those assembled around the bed, where now was only senseless clay. All were awed into silence by the presence of the angel of death. But when Mrs. Hosmer shut out the garish sunshine, which seemed so incongruous with that mysterious presence, and the members of the family one by one withdrew to their own apartments, the noise of wailing was heard   ^-26   STEP BY STEP,--OR, throughout the house. Judge Grafton still sat beside the form of his son, his head bowed upon his hands, but no sound of woe proceeded from his lips. The last sad rites were over. Judge Grafton, and as large number of his friends, as are usually ready to pay respect to wealth, followed the body to its beautiful resting-place in Greenwood. Here the Autumn winds sighed a funeral dirge over the new made grave,--and falling leaf and blighted flower withered and passed away in seeming sympathy with the early dead. The effect of Fred's death was different upon the different members of the farhily. His mother's violent grief soon exhausted itself, and not many days passed by before she was absorbed in attention to her mourn- ing apparel, and in preparations for returning to the city. Maria, whose nature was constitutionally cold and heartless, preserved an outward gravity of de- meanor, without affecting a grief she could not feel; and Clara, who resembled her mother in tempera- ment, soon found other and more agreeable subjects of thought than the departed brother. But in the father there was a change perceptible to the most careless observer. His hair, which in the spring was untouched with the frosts of age, was now grown quite gray; his haughty erect figure was slightly bent; and his step was less firm than for- merly. Instead of that punctilious regard to idle forms and vain ceremonies, in which he once took so much pride; he now appeared quite indifferent to them, and, indeed, scarcely noticed at all, sins of omission and commission, in what had heretofore been matters of great importance.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      263 But in his manners, so far as his own immediate family were concerned, he was as cold and distant as ever. If there was any change in him in this par- ticular, it was to the side of severity. His wife felt even that there had come to be an impassable gulf between him and herself, but she had not sufficient depth of character or penetration to discover the cause. As there never had been any closer bond of union between them than that of devotion to the world and its fashions, she was not much affected by the change, and consequently con- tinued on in her usual course of life. With respect to Delia, his manner was evidently changed. It is true, he seldom spoke to her now, but when he did, it was in accents more resembling those in which he addressed his son in that last try- ing week of his illness. On her part, Delia longed to express to him her sympathy, but she did not dare to do it. Something, she scarcely knew what, held her back. At the same time she had a strong impression that there were influences at work upon his feelings, which it would be better to leave to themselves. The time might come when even she could be of service to him, but at present she must be silent. Of one thing she was certain, that there was one deep and abiding interest in common between them, and that was love for the departed; for, by her so long and so devoted at- tendance upon her cousin, she had learned to love him. She was now busy preparing to go East with her uncle, who had fixed on the third week in October to come for her. She had received a kind letter from her unknown aunt, which had reconciled her some-   264      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, what to going again among strangers. The year, which was now closing, had been one of trial and discipline; one of those years, in fact, of which there are such in every life, whose events stand forth to the memory in bold relief compared with the ordinary circumstances of one's experience, and impress them- selves upon the character for time and eternity.- She had complied with her father's wish. She had seen what a life of splendor and luxury was, and had found it altogether insufficient in itself to give her happiness or peace of mind. Do riches necessarily lead to such a life? To her mind Mrs. Lawton was a living and convincing proof of the contrary. Indeed she had learned from her that if wealth has its cares, and trials, and tempta- tionsj it also gives to the possessor the inestimable power and privilege of doing good and conferring happiness. As she reviewed the experience of the past year, she realized how beneficial to her character had been the discipline through which she had passed, since through it she had come to a better knowledge of herself, which was indeed an important and an ad- vancing step in religious progress. True, this knowl- edge had caused her many an unhappy hour, and many a bitter tear; and the path she had been travelling had seemed to her through a gloomy forest, where perils and snares beset her feet, and where scarcely a ray of light penetrated to show her the *way. Step by step she was pursuing the road every sinning and unregenerated child of earth must walk ere he fully enters Christ's kingdom, and his feet are firmly planted on the Rock of Ages. But as God's   DELIA ARLINGTON.       265 promises are sure and steadfast, so shall each pilgrim in the heavenly journey come from ignorance to knowledge, from doubt to faith, from darkness into light, from earthly fears and low desires, to holy con- fidence and unwavering trust; and, "Good cheer, good cheer, soon ends the bitter strife, And thou shalt reign in peace with Christ at length." For the present this story has little more connection with the Grafton family, and here we will part with them as Delia did in kindness and good will, trusting that time, whose unfaltering march is accompanied by such wonderful revolutions in the affairs of men and nations, will witness changes in the current of their lives and hopes of their hearts. Two members of the family were sincerely grieved at Delia's departure,--little Herbert and good Irish Mary, --the former, it is true, with the quickly dried tears of happy, light-hearted infancy, and the latter with the demonstrative sorrow of her nation. "An' true it is, Miss Delia, when you are gone the light of the house itself'll be put out, an' sure it is Mary will wish herself back again in the old cabin at home. But may-be," brightening up at the thought, "you'll let me come and live with you, when you are married, Miss Delia?" "You'll be married yourself long before I shall, I dare say, Mary; but if you're not, we'll talk about it then. Meantime, keep a good heart, and don't leave little Herbert." * When Delia went to her room to put on her bonnet, the morning of her departure, she found a note from Judge Grafton. Its contents, which were most gratifying to her, were as follows:-- 23   266   STEP BY STEP,--OR, DELIA ARLINGTON. "I could not allow you to go away, Delia, without telling you that I am deeply grateful to you for the past; and asking your prayers for one who feels his need of the mercy of God, and the redeeming love of the Saviour. Accept this little locket contain- ing the hair of one, for your kindness to whom, you will ever be remembered by, "Sincerely your friend, HERBERT GRAFTON."   PART II. CHAPTER      I. "Life went a maying With Nature, #ope, and Poesy, When I was young."  COLERIDGE. "A LETTER, mamma, from Buffalo, is it from Uncle Howard?" "Probablyv, my dear, but I can answer your ques- tion better, after I have opened and read it." So saying, Mrs. Leslie took the letter from her son's hand, and broke the seal. She was so absorbed in its contents, that even after she had finished read- ing it, she sat lost in thought, forgetful of the son, who stood beside her wishfully scanning her face. She was aroused from this revery, however, by the entrance of another boy, whose whole appearance told at once, that he was not one, of whose presence the most abstracted of mothers could long remain ignorant, for he was the very personification of active buoyant life. "What's the news, mother? A letter from my uncle? When is Cousin Delia coming? Does she want to come, and is Uncle Howard coming with her?" "One question at a time, my son; and to answer one your patient brother asked me also," gently   268      STEP BY STEP,--OR, stroking the fair chestnut curls, as she spoke, of the first named boy, " it is from your Uncle Howard, and he expects to come next week and bring your Cousin Delia. Whether she wishes to come or not, I can- not tell, but we must try to make her happy, when she is here. She is fatherless and motherless, you know, Howard," addressing the elder boy. "I'll do all I can to make her happy, I'm sure; but I hope she isntt a fine young lady, like -" "Hush, my son, no names." "Well, I hope she's a girl of sense, and not a young lady of fashion, that's all." "Your uncle speaks highly of her, my dear; but whatever she is, don't forget she has every claim on your kindness." "Mamma" said the gentle Duncan, "I'll lend her my books to read, and I'll share with her my garden and flowers." "That is right, my boy, you all will be kind to her, I have no doubt; and I hope she will learn to love you. To be sure, you are rather a noisy band for a young girl, who has neither brother nor sister, to come among." "Well," said Howard, "if she doesn't like our noise, she can make little sister her associate. She can't help loving her; if she doesn't, she'll not be worth loving herself. Hallo, Harry, what's the trouble now?" addressing a boy, who came running in, sobbing violently and apparently much excited. "Go away, How, you shan't stop me. I will tell mammal and pushing past his elder brother, the little fellow threw himself into his mother's lap. "What is the matter, Harry?" she asked gently but gravely.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      269 "Oh, that naughty, naughty Tom Simpson has broken my pretty little cart, and he says he don't care. I wish I'd whipped him, and I would if he hadn't run off like a sneak, as he is."    , "There, Harry, go into my, dressing-room and stay till you are calm, and then come and tell mamma the whole story." "Highty, tighty,' said Howard, as Harry obeyed, "what a Harry Hotspur he is; Tom is a good boy, and I don't believe he meant to break Harry's wagon." "Howard, how often must I tell you not to call Harry such names; it only aggravates the trouble. Such a quick temper is enough to contend with surely, without your adding fuel to the flame." "I know it's wrong, but then he is such a Harry Hotspur, I can't resist the temptation of calling him so sometimes. But 'who comes here, a grenadier?"' said he, as another boy walked gravely into the room, with somewhat of a stiff martial air, and quietly seated himself at an open window. "The roll is called now, and we muster strong; here's Gilbert, and Edward, and Fairy Em. Will not Cousin Delia be astonished when she sees us all together? Look, mother, there's Harry's sunshiny face peeping out at the door; I'll kiss Fairy for you, while you settle matters with him." A And the good-natured elder brother took the sweet golden haired, blue-eyed, pet of the house, the only sister of six brothers, and tossed her in his arms. 'c No, How; no, lkop, Fairy." "Which means, being translated from baby lan- guage, into mother English; No, Howard, stop jumping Fairy so high,' doesn't it, little one?" 28*   270     'STEP BY STEP,--OR, A very emphatic nod of the head and a decided "yes," was the answer of the little two years' old girl. Oh,-dear, Fairy, what a lot is yours?" proceeded the lively boy. "I heard Mr. Ellis tell mother, the other day, that it takes three girls in a household to soften one boy, and here are you, one wee fairy among us all, six rude boys." "Not all rude, if you please;" said the erect martial figure, who still sat at the window, the -very personification of propriety. "Duncan is never rude, you know, and Harry is a very well-behaved little fellow when he's -" "Not in a passion," interposed Howard. "And --" the boy hesitated. "And," again interrupted Howard, " we all know that Algernon Sidney Leslie, is as proper, polite, and gentlemanly, as becomes the bearer of such a name. Indeed, I doubt if that stanch old whig, equalled his youthful namesake in manners," mak- ing a low reverence, as he spoke, to his younger brother. "You may laugh as much as you please, Howard, but it will make no difference with me. I don't mind your laughing a bit; but I don't want you to call us all rude boys." This was said gravely, but without the least evi- dence of irritated feeling, and Howard's answer came from the promptings of his truly good heart. "That's right, my little man; stick to your own ideas of what's proper, and never mind anybody's ridicule. It isn't fair to call you a rude boy, or Dun- can either, I acknowledge. Shake hands, Harry, my man, and, if mother's willing, we'll go and look into   DELIA ARLINGTON.      271 that fractured wagon, and perhaps I can repair it for you." Mrs. Leslie-smiled an assent, and the children one by one, after hearing the good news in mamma's let- ter, filed off to their several amusements; for it was a holiday with them all, leaving their mother once more alone with Duncan. From his infancy up, this boy had been his mother's constant companion, and most efficient helper. Always a delicate child, he had required more of the personal care and attention of Mrs. Leslie than all her other children. Not being able to participate in the active sports of his elder brother, Howard, and having tastes, which gave a different direction to his pursuits from those of the precise Algernon, or Ally, as he was familiarly called, he found his mother's room his pleasantest place of resort. Here he learned to knit and sew, and at last developed a decided taste for drawing. He was allowed to amuse himself in this way, when he could not exercise In the open air. His mother had hitherto superintended his studies, and he was now prepared to enter the High School, which, it was hoped, his health would allow him to attend. Young as he was, and still an invalid, he even now repaid his mother, by the services which he rendered her, for the care and anxiety she had bestowed on him. Thoughtful and gentle, ever on the watch to wait upon or aid her, he insensibly filled a daughter's place, and was regarded by all the mem- bers of the family with that tender love and respect, which one so unassuming and amiable, is always sure to inspire in a large household. Even Howard, who delighted to expend a portion of his exuberant   272      STEP BY STEP-- OR, spirits on, as he sometimes called him, the model gentleman of Walnut Hill, Ally, never allowed himself to say a word, which could give pain to this sensitive brother. On the contrary, he rather looked up to him, and, in one sense, leaned upon him; for underneath Duncan's quiet demeanor there was a substantial basis of sound judgment, and indeed of all those qualities, which constitute manliness of character; while, on the other hand, Howard's nature was somewhat versatile, like his conversation, and he sometimes was hasty in forming opinions, and too little persevering in his purposes. Howard was now in his seventeenth year, and was just completing an extended course of study at the High School, preparatory to entering his father's counting-room, for he possessed a decided talent for business. Duncan, notwithstanding the feebleness of his health, was looking forward to a college life, and to the Christian ministry. Algernon was twelve years of age; Harry, nine. Edward and Gilbert, twins, seven; and the baby and pet, Emily, two. Mrs. Leslie took up the letter from her brother again and re-read it. Upon laying it down, Duncan noticed, that she sighed, and fancying there was some call for his ever ready sympathy, said: "Is it a great many years since you have seen Uncle Edward, mamma?" "Yes, my love, nearly twenty; not since I was married." "That is a great while. You will not know him, mamma?" "Yes, I think I should know him anywhere; he was, and is, very dear to me, and we do not easily forget those we have ever loved, even if they are changed."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      273 "Then, why are you so sad, mamma, if you loved him so much, and he is coming to see you so soon?" "Because, my dear, he tells me in this letter, how sad and lonely he has been, all these years, and I cannot help thinking I might have induced him to come and live with us; and then perhaps he would not have been so lonely." "Well, you did what you thought was right, mamma, so I should not be troubled about it." "That would be the wiser course, truly, my son; but I fear the loss of your two sisters, who died when Howard was a baby, my own delicate health, and many family cares, made -me too forgetful of the claims of the absent upon me." "But, mamma, how could you help thinking of all those things, when it was your own family, and I don't see why Uncle Howard, if he was so lonely, could not, at least, come to visit you, in all this time. I shan't let twenty years pass without seeing our Fairy, if she is ever married, and goes away." "I hope there will be no circumstances that will lead you to do so," said Mrs. Leslie half smiling at the idea of pet Fairy being married, and mistress of a household. "And now, my son, you must go to the station with James to meet your father. Your holidays will do you no good, I fear, if you spend them in your mother's room." "There is no place so dear to me, mamma. I tell you what, when I go to college, I must have a pic- ture of this dear place, with that comfortable couch, not too good to be used; those book-shelves, and this pretty little centre table, with your vase of flowers, and work, and books, upon it; and these, too," hold-   274      STEP BY STEP, --OR, ing up a broken toy, and worn shoe, belonging to little Emily. "No I will have your daguerreotype, and then I can fill out the rest.' "Yes, dear, you shall have it. Now go and ask Aunt Charlotte if she would like to go to the station with you. She was not very well this morning, and, perhaps, the clear October air will do her good." "Yes, mamma, I will." In a few minutes he returned, saying; "Aunt Char- lotte says she can't possibly-go; she's so busy at work, and she says also, it's too cold for-comfort, and besides, she can't think how anybody can call the air fine to-day." "Well, my dear, get ready yourself, and I will go with you." "Yes, please do, mamma." Mrs. Leshe had but just put away her work pre- paratory to dressing herself for going out, when the door opened, and Aunt Charlotte entered. "I concluded, Mary, on second thought," she said, "I might as well go, as stay; may-be, the air will not be so killing sharp out doors as it is coming in at the windows." "Second thoughts are often best, and I am glad you are going," was Mrs. Leslie's pleasant reply, sit- ting down to her work again. "Now I am very sorry; can't you go too," said Duncan, when his aunt left the room; not at all gratified at the result of her " second thought." "No, my dear; for I promised Harry, that he should go to-night, and I really do not care to." Duncan, with his usual consideration, said nothing more, but quietly went for his coat and hat.  o All the members of the household with the excep-   DELIA ARLINGTON.

Left a widow, ten years before, with one child, a fine promising boy, of twelve; her brother, at the earnest request of his wife, had given them both a home, as her income was barely sufficient to clothe herself and son, and educate the latter. Mrs. Leslie knew something of Mrs. Norton's pecul- iarities, when she made the proposal, but she did not expect to find them so prominent, as they proved to be, at all times, and seasons. However, as her only motive, in making the proposal, had been to aid her sister in-law, and as she believed her to be ia devout and sincere Christian, at heart, she managed to do what few could, or would have done,--get along amicably with her. At the same time, it was a great trial to have any one in her family whose ideas and ways, so many of them, were at variance with her own and her husband's, and whose views of life were so different from theirs. Howard, whose lively disposition and free manner of speaking frequently subjected him to his mother's mild rebukes, was wont to say she was an excellent refrigerator to an exuberance of spirits, and some- times brought upon himself one of Aunt Charlotte's lectures, which he would laughingly say, afterwards, were the chief pleasures of her life; and he was quite willing to be the means of affording her that gratification.   276      STEP BY STEP,--OR, CHAPTER    II.

"AROUSE yourself, my meditative maiden; yonder is the Athens of America, and somewhere in that direction," pointing out of the window as he spoke, "Iies your future home," said Mr. Howard to Delia as their journey drew near its end. "I shall be glad when it is over," answered Delia, with a deep sigh. "When what is over, my dear?" "This meeting strangers again. How I long to be settled down quietly somewhere, and forget that I am an orphan." "Unless your Aunt Mary has greatly changed, or her letters belie her feelings, you will find her ready to take a mother's place to you. But here we are at the station; now the question is, how are we to get out to R  ?" "Is this Mr. Howard?" asked a gentleman, in the prime of life and activity, coming forward, as uncle and niece stood on the platform, considering what they should do, for Mr. Howard felt himself a stranger in a strange land, and was almost as much- bewildered as Delia. "That is my name, sir, but you have the advantage of me; I do not recognize you." "Probably not, sir," replied the other, a frank srpile adding another charm to a fine intelligent face; "but I am your sister's husband, William Leslie, and am   DELIA ARLINGTON.      2" most glad to welcome you and this young lady to Boston." "4 Is it possible you are Mr. Leslie?" replied Mr. Howard, warmly returning the cordial shake of the hand, with which his brother-in-law -received him. "Time has dealt gently with you, although you are very much changed." "Yes, so Mary says; from a slender stripling to rather a stout substantial figure." "How did you know us in this crowd?" "I had formed a very correct idea, I find, of your appearance, Mr. Howard, and when I saw you with this young lady, both of you evidently strangers in this city, I was sure I was right. I did not expect to find you so easily, however; now that I have found you, come to my carriage, and my son shall look after your luggage. Here we are, my boy, I have found our friends. Mr. Howard, let me introduce our eldest son to you," said Mr. Leslie, as he came up to the carriage, beside which Howard stood. "And this is my Cousin Delia'?" said the boy after shaking hands with his uncle, "whom we have all been so impatient to see. You don't know, cousin, what a tribe of little Leslies are waiting at home to see who shall be the first to welcome Cousin Delia." "I hope," said his father, " they will not kill her with kindness. She must be very weary. Take these checks, my boy, and get your uncle's luggage." Howard left them at his father's bidding, and Mr. Leslie, placing Mr. Howard and Delia in his carriage, ordered the coachman to drive off. Delia, wrapped in a thick plaid, enjoyed the pleasant motion, in con- trast with the noise and confusion of the cars. There 24    278      STEP BY STEP,--OR, was little conversation by the way, for the travellers were weary. "Here we are, Cousin Delia," said Mr. Leslie, after three quarter's of an hour's ride, as the carriage turned into an avenue, leading to a dwelling, stand- incg at some distance from the road. Lights gleaming from the house made a cheerful impression on the weary girl. As they drew near, bright faces and curly heads were seen for an instant, at the windows, and then vanished to throw open the hall door to the expected guests. Delia lingered behind her uncle, who was the first to receive the affectionate welcome of Mrs. Leslie. Few words were exchanged between the long separated brother and sister; for their thoughts were not those that could be uttered before spectators. Mr. Howard turned and presenting Delia to her aunt, said: "This is our dear niece; I have brought her to you, and hope she will find a mother, and you another daughter." The gentle, loving embrace, with which Mrs. Leslie answered this appeal, was enough for Delia. She felt at once that she had found a mother---one to whom she could be a daughter. Mrs. Leslie then introduced her brother and niece to the expectant band of children; and soon after took Delia to a moderately sized, but tastefully furnished room, which she told her was for her occupancy. Everything in it looked as if intended for comfort, and nothing for show. A pretty set of book-shelves, partly filled, and a vase of late autumn flowers, and the spotless white curtains, bed and toilet covers, particularly attracted her attention.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      279 "Now, lie down and rest. I could almost fancy I had my own sister Delia with me once more, when you smile, you are so like her. Sit down and rest till Howard comes with the trunks, and then when you have made yourself comfortable, we will have tea." After Mrs. Leshe had assisted her niece in remov- ing her numerous wrappings, and had once more kissed her, she withdrew. This was what Delia wanted, to be left alone to collect her confused thoughts, and compare the reality with what had been her doubts and fears and anticipations. When she was told that her Aunt Mary was the wife of a mechanic, she had pictured to herself a man, she could not quite say, gentleman, somewhat superior perhaps to Mr. Carter, or the carpenters she had seen at home, employed about her father's house. She had no other idea of a mechanic; and when her uncle had spoken of his brother-in-law as a man of intelligence, she supposed he meant that he was a man who ranked above the average of his class in this particular, that is, intelligent for a mechanic, and consequently she had been in the habit of thinking of her unknown Aunt Mary with secret feelings of pity.            - But now she was very sure if Mr. Leshe was not, in the best sense of the word, a gentleman, she had never seen one. It was true, he had not that extreme polish of manner, which so frequently glosses over a cold heart, but then he had, she thought, what was far better, a frank, cordial bearing, which at once put every one at ease. She could but contrast Mr. Les- lie's reception of herself with that of Judge Grafton, when she entered his family one year before.   OVU      STEP BY STEP,--OR, Had she at last found a home, where she could love and be loved? Her aunt's gentle and affec- tionate manner towards her, and the bright, kind faces of her cousins, made her think she had. And again, as she had done a year previous, she shed tears, -but now they were tears of thankful hap- piness,-and she did not forget her offerings of gratitude where alone they were due, for the mercy shown her in the past and the joy foreshadowed for' the future. When Howard brought the trunks, Mrs. Leslie came to her niece's room to assist her in any neces- sary unpacking; and Delia was soon ready to go below, where tea was waiting. "We promised the children,- all excepting Fairy Em,--that they should sit up and take tea with us to-night, to celebrate your arrival," said Mrs. Leslie to her brother. "You see we make a good table full, but," turning to Duncan, "where is your Aunt Charlotte?" "Here she is, mamma," as the door at that mo- ment opened and the lady in questioned entered. After the introduction was over, they all sat down to a substantial supper. As Delia glanced around the table, at her aunt, Mr. Leslie and her cousins, she was much impressed by the expression of their faces. She thought she had never before, in her life, seen so many bright, healthy, happy countenances in one family, but as she looked at Mrs. Norton, who sat opposite her, she was immediately struck with the contrast between her appearance and that of all the others.  This lady bore a general resemblance to her brother, and was good looking, so far as particular   DELIA ARLINGTON.      281 features went, but her general expression was so very unhappy, that it was difficult to see anything attractive in her face. Even when she smiled, it was so much more the mockery of a smile than a real one, that she looked pleasanter in her grim sobriety. It was a matter of astonishment to Delia how Mrs. Norton could live in such an atmosphere as seemed to pervade her aunt's family, and look as she did; and she wondered if she was the sepulchre in the garden,-the skeleton at the feast,-to that united, happy household. She longed to hear her speak, and in this she was soon gratified, for Aunt Charlotte never chose to be a cypher in any company. In the first pause in the conversation she addressed Delia: "You must have had a very uncomfortable journey to-day?" "Oh no, Ma'am," was Delia's reply. "It was de- lightful; I enjoyed it very much." "Well, if any body can enjoy this biting, cold weather, whizzing through the air in a railroad car, it's my opinion they can enjoy anything. This world hasn't any thorns and briars for them, that's certain." "I suppose, aunt," said saucy Howard, "Delia hasn't begun to look after the thorns and briars in everything yet; you know she hasn't your experience in life, and it's not to be expected that she can have your penetration." An admonishing glance from his mother silenced him at this point. Mrs. Norton taking no notice of her nephew's sally, went on talking to Delia about the discomforts of travelling in general, and of railroad travelling in particular; but finding she was not making much 24"   282      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, impression upon the young girl, who did not appear to sympathize much with her, she turned to Mr. Howard, and said: "Have you ever been in these parts before, sir?" "Not since I was quite a young man, Madam," was the reply. "Well, Boston follis think there's no second place between them and heaven; but, for my part, I think they haven't so much to be proud of. I don't know much about other cities, having been brought up and lived much of my life in New Hampshire; but there's sin enough in Boston to cause a judgment to be sent on the land, that's my opinion." "I am afraid sin is not confined to Boston, Madam, but is to be found wherever men do congregate." "Those are my sentiments, sir; but brother William and sister Mary here will persist that this is a good world, and there are good people in it; but I tell them they haven't had my experience of life yet, and of course I ought to know best." "Paradoxical as it may appear to you, Madam, I agree with them as well as with you." "I don't understand you, sir," said Mrs. Norton, pitching her voice to its sharpest key, and with con- siderable asperity in her manner; "I don't know how you can think the world a wicked and a good one too." "Because it is one or the other according to the view we take of it, or the aspect which it presents to us. God has made everything beautiful in its sea- son; and he created man after his own image, and to be constantly decrying the world, and dwelling upon its wickedness, seems very much like reflecting or God and His Providence. In a world like this, with   DELIA ARLINGTON.     , 283 its varying elements of good and evil, we -generally find what we seek; if beauty and goodness, -lo, it is all around us in nature's ever-changing aspect, and in the lives of the pure and holy; if, on the contrary, we seek for deformity and vice, we find it in the con- sequences of sin; and in man, fallen from his once high state and glorying in his fall." "Well," said Mrs. Norton, with the air of one determined to maintain her ground, " my experience tells me, and the Apostle Paul confirms it, that there is none good, no not one." "The apostle prefaces that remark, if my memory serves me, with saying,' it is written,' quoting from the Old Testament. Many passages might be quoted in the same way in support of an argument, without using the language in a strictly literal sense. But since you have cited St Paul as authority, he also says, 'Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you;' which proves my side of the argument, does it not, as conclusively as your quotation proves yours?" Before Mrs. Norton could reply, Mr. Leslie inter- posed with saying, good humoredly: "Another time, sister Charlotte, I do not doubt, Mr. Howard will finish this conversation with you. I must now protest against your farther monopoly of him at present." Soon after tea the younger children were sent to bed. Howard took a seat beside Delia, and amused her with his pleasant, playful talk, while the elder members of the family conversed together in cheerful tones. At an early hour, Mr. Leshe had family devotion, arnd her aunt proposed to Delia to retire, and accom-   284      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, panied her to her room. Once more Mrs. Leslie told her how much she reminded her of her loved elder sister, and how glad she was to welcome a child of hers under her roof. "And you will tell 'me all about my mother's early days, dear Aunt Leslie, will you not? I want to know a great deal about her; I cannot realize that I ever had a mother." "No, poor child, you were too young, when she died, to remember her. Some time I will tell you of our happy childhood; although your Uncle Edward was more my playmate, as your mother was some years older than I. Now, dear child, go to sleep, and rest yourself."              i It was long past midnight before the brother and sister separated, so much had they to communicate of what had transpired during all the long years they had been strangers.

I am very glad to see you," said  Mrs. Leslie, a few evenings after Delia's arrival in R--- , as a young gentleman entered the room, who was evidently on familiar terms with the family, "even more glad than usual, since I have here an old and a new friend of your mother's to introduce to you, my brother and my niece.

"And as Helen has already introduced this young lady to me," turn- ing to Delia, " let us consider ourselves acquaintances at once." "And if acquaintances, why not friends?" said Mrs. Leslie. "That would be more in accordance with the relation she sustains to your mother and sister." "With all due respect to my mother and sister, they would scarcely wish to choose my friends for me, or found my friendships on theirs. So, as Miss Delia and I may prove to be decidedly antagonistic to each other, it will be safer not to enter into any compact of friendship too soon." Delia made no reply, for her spirits had not yet re- O  '    286      STEP BY STEP-, OR, covered their elastic tone, and she never was much addicted to pert repartee. She could not, however, help asking herself, "Is this Melville Temple, ' that paragon of paragons,' as Adie called him? He is right," she thought, "we are antagonistic to each other; at least," as she listened to his sensible, busi- ness like, matter-of-fact conversation with her uncle and Mr. Leslie, "there can be but little sympathy between us." With this thought, she turned her at- tention to Howard, who was talking in his usual bantering style to Ally. Once in the course of the evening, however, as Delia looked at Melville Tem- ple, she saw him absorbed in conversation with her aunt, and from his appearance, she judged upon some subject of deep interest to himself, so changed was his manner. He left at an early hour. After he had gone, Howard said: "( A penny for your thoughts, Cousin Delia." She started and blushed, then answered: "They are not worth that to any one but myself." "Oh, the worth of a thing the possessor is never a fair judge of, cousin; he is quite as likely to under- rate as overrate it." "Well," said Delia, "I was wondering how Mel- ville Temple came to be so very different from what I supposed him to be, or, in other words, so unlike his mother and sister." "How unlike, my dear?" said her aunt. "In his manners particularly. They are so gentle, and have such refined tastes. He seems altogether practical, and then he is so blunt." "I grant his manners are somewhat brusque, as the French have it; but that he is practical to-the exclusion of refined tastes and sensibilities, you will   DELIA ARLINGTON.      287 find upon a more intimate acquaintance with him, is not the case." "Ah," nlow broke in Howard, "I knew Cousin Delia's air castle about Melville was demolished be- fore he had been five minutes in the room. I could see it in her downcast eye, and hear it in her deep drawn sigh, - in fact, to substitute she for he, - as Shakespeare says: ' She raised a sigh so piteous and profound, As it did seem to shatter all her bulk, And end her being.' " At this absurd picture all laughed, none more heart- ily than Delia herself. Mrs. Leslie immediately said, good humoredly: "I forewarn you. Delia, of this naughty boy's propensity to find fun in everything, and to quote Shakespeare indefinitely. We think he must commit passages daily in secret, and then purposely introduce subjects in which he can use them." "Ah, mother dear, I didn't know before, you thought me either so industrious or ingenious," and rising, he made a low bow and returned to his books. Mr. Howard remained a fortnight with his sister, and when he left, it was with the promise of returning the ensuing summer and spending some time with the family. The day previous to his departure, he went on a long drive with his niece. It was the first opportunity they had had to be alone with each other for any length of time since their arrival, and although each had much to say to the other, yet, as is common in such cases, they drove on for some distance in silence. At length, Mr. Howard said, somewhat abruptly    288      STEP BY STEP, 0-R "Delia, I want to know your first impressions of your new home." "(They are everything that is pleasant, uncle, al- though I have hardly got over my bewildered feelings at finding myself so differently situated from what I expected; indeed, there is nothing and no person here at all-as I had supposed, except my aunt." "Tell me, my dear, in what the difference consists." "First, I had formed such a foolish idea of Mr. Leslie. You said he was a mechanic, and I was silly enough to imagine that his- employment must of course affect his manners and character; and, beside- " "And beside, you very naturally thought, despite my confession, that I could never have been so ab- surd as to object to a man solely on account of his occupation." "I did suppose there must have been some other reason, uncle." "None in the world, child. Thank heaven, you were brought up without any of those ridiculous no- tions which were the bane of my early years. But what next?" "Why, uncle, I supposed Mr. Leslie must be poor; no, not exactly poor either, but I supposed they lived in a small house with one servant perhaps; in fact, in every way different from what I find them.'" "No, my dear, Mr. Leslie is a rich man. He is a machinist, and commenced life as a journeyman la- borer in the establishment, in which he is now one of the principal partners. In fact, he built up the busi- ness for the most part himself. It was a small con- cern when he entered it." "I did not suppose he was really rich; for although   DELIA ARLINGTON.      289 they have everything comfortable about them, an ex- cellent library and a fine garden, there is nothing in their dress or furniture that indicate wealth. I think my father would have said they have found the golden mean." '"I think he would, my dear. I don't know that I was ever in a family whose members seem to have found so-perfectly that happy medium in all things which is so rarely attained. Your aunt might dress in velvet and jewels if she liked, and have the most costly furniture in the house, but such is not her taste." "Have you been in the boy's gymnasium, uncle?"  Yes." "Is it not a grand place for them to play and exer- cise in, in dull weather?" "It is, indeed." 'c And Howard has his little work room and car- penters' tools, where he tinkers, he says, to his heart's content, and the boys have such nice garden tools also. All these things must have cost a good deal, uncle." "Yes, my dear, but Mr. Leslie will get good in- terest for his money." "What, uncle?" "Mr. Leslie will get good interest for his money in the health and contentment these things give to his children; and besides, the children themselves are early forming habits of industry, each cultivating his own peculiar talent." "Yes,uncle, Duncan, who cannot play much with his active brothers, has a pony; and then he draws quietly in his mother's room. - He is a dear boy, Uncle Edward."' 25   290      STEP BY STEP,---OR, "He is so; but I hope you like your Cousin Howard?" "Oh, yes, I like him, he's so funny; but then, his fun is always good-natured, and he is always so careful never to pain Duncan, who is so sensitive. I like him very much." "I am glad you do; he is so near your age you can enjoy a great deal together, if you do not mind his harmless jokes; and, Delia, I very much wish you to cultivate your social powers, and to strive to become more cheerful; indeed, I should like to see you posi- tively gay at times. You are young, and youth is the season for keen enjoyment. The last fourteen months of your life have been crowded with events peculiarly trying to you, and almost of necessity, during all this time, you have been under the shadow of a cloud, but now I trust a brighter day is dawning for you. With the prospect of much happiness be- fore you in your new home, and the joyful hope with regard to the future I know you are cherishing, I de- sire that you will open your heart to the genial influ- ences by which you are surrounded, and enjoy life as it is natural you should, while you steadfastly pursue the path of duty." "' I should like to be more cheerful, uncle; and I am sure I shall strive to be so; for oh, I shouldn't care to, look only on the shady side of life, as Howard says his Aunt Charlotte does." "I trust you never will, my child; and in order that you may not, you must begin early to cultivate a cheerful spirit. Look always for a bright side in everything, and you will be pretty sure to find one. The rough, unpolished jewel presents a dark, repul- sive aspect to the eye of one who seeks for beauty;   DELIA ARLINGTON.      291 but under the judicious process to which the skilful lapidary subjects it, the same jewel emits rays of al- most heavenly light and brilliancy. So it is with the afflictive events in one's experience, and with unlovely characters. They may be turned to good account in our discipline, and may be made the occasion and the means of heavenly blessedness to the soul. The Christian will remember in his sorest trials, that the darkest hour is always before the dawn that heralds the coming of the glorious sun; and he will also remember, that the most misanthropic of his fellow beings may perchance have the cloud lifted from his spirits by the power of sympathizing love. Begin with emitting light yourself, and then you will be able to draw it from others." "Not always, uncle, or I'm sure Mrs. Norton could not have lived so long in my aunt's family without partaking, more than she seems to have done, of its spirit." "Mrs. Norton has, I should judge, an unfortunate temperament to commence with, and then her early religious education must have been such as to lead her to look on the dark side in everything, and to form a low opinion of her fellow creatures; yet, she is not uninfluenced or unaffected by the atmosphere that surrounds her. Mr. Leslie told me that she was quite a different woman now from what she was when she first became a member of his family, and that in reality she is by no means so gloomy and severe in her feelings as she seems to be. He says her 'second thoughts' are always good, but that habit, early and long indulged in, has become almost a second nature with her, consequently she talks and acts as she does. Take warning from her, Delia. See how powerful   292     STEP BY STEP,---OR, early habit is in her case, and to what extent it destroys the influence of a person truly kind and Christian, as she undoubtedly is." 4' Why, uncle,s" said Delia in some dismay, " do you think I am in any danger of becoming what Mrs. Norton is, so gloomy and morose?" "Not what she is perhaps, but with your present tendency to revery and pensive thoughtfulness, my child, you are in great danger of committing the same error that I have done in life." "What, uncle?" "That of withdrawing yourself too much from society, and consequently from an interest in your fellow beings. It is an error which I very much de- plore, now that I am too old to remedy it to any great extent. My visit here, and seeing how much good may be done in a community like this, by one man animated by a truly Christian spirit, have made me resolve to strive, as far as possible, to correct my own faultiness. Now, dear child, that I have given you this little lecture, let me tell you how happy I am to have you here with my sister and her husband. In your aunt you will find what you never yet have had, for any length of time, a tender, judicious female friend, who will take a mother's place to you. I need not remind you of your duties to her; for the past summer has shown that you do not require to be told, when and where you can make yourself useful. Now, my darling, we will talkabout your school, your allowance, &c." That evening, Melville Temple called again. In the conversation that. followed between him and Mr. Howard, for whom his visit was intended,. Delia learned how it happened that he was so intimate in her aunt's family.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      293 It was one of those singular coincidences which are often occurring, when accident introduces to our acquaintance persons, of whose history, or whose existence we have had no knowledge hitherto, but in whom subsequent events prove, we have some special interest. It seems that Melville was teaching an academy in a neighboring town, and was in the habit of visiting a family living near Mr. Leslie's. The year previous in his summer vacation, he was taken sick with a fever there, while the lady of the house, Mrs. Wentworth, was absent. Mrs. Leslie, who had occasionally met him, upon learning his condition, used to go every day to see him and look after his comfort, and as soon as he was in a state to be moved, had him brought to her own house, and the kindest care taken of him. It was not until after her brother's arrival that she knew she had been befriending the son of one so very dear to him. He was now boarding in I the neighborhood, and in the habit of calling frequent- ly and, familiarly at Mrs. Leslie's. After Melville left, Mr. Howard spoke of him in terms of praise. He-said he should have no hesita- tion whatever, in reposing the utmost confidence in a young man that evinced so much spirit and truthful- ness. "Which Delia calls bluntness, uncle," said Howard. ("Better be blunt and honest, Delia, than fair and false," answered her uncle. "( Yes, sir, certainly ; but I do not see any necessary connection between honesty and bluntness; at all events, I know truthful people, who are not blunt, and they are more winning and pleasing certainly." :' Granted, but as no one mortal contains within 25*   294      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, himself all the requisites to perfection, we will not, quarrel with our young friend, if he has a somewhat independent way of expressing himself. It must be recollected, that he was early thrown upon the world, and his own resources." "-Beside," added Mr. Leslie, " that manner of his will -wear off as he goes more into society." - But Mr. Leslie," said Delia. "Well, Miss Delia," was the reply in a playful tone. "Uncle Edward thinks habit is all powerful, and if that is the case, I should think there was- little hope of his manners changing." "Habit is more powerful in some cases than others. I think Melville only needs more intimate association- with ladies, to soften his, to you, objectionable man- ners. I confess," added Mr. Leslie smiling, "I pre- fer his blunt cordiality to the polite ceremony of a, young lady, who persists in calling her aunt's hus- band, Mr. Leslie." Delia laughed and blushed, and said, "I did not know as you wished to claim me for a niece, sir." "I believe I must, if my wife and I are one. I know it is one of the fashions of the present day to give up titles of relationship as much as possible, but I claim all my wife's relations as mine, so you must call me uncle, if you call her aunt." "I am sure 1 shall be thankful to call you so, if you like it; and now,' turning archly to Mr. Leslie, she said, "you will not call me Miss Delia any more." "No, unless you break your compact, in that case, I shall certainly treat you as formally as you do me. I want to be loved and respected in my household, but I have no wish to inspire awe,"   DELIA ARLINGTON.      g295 And evidently Mr. Leslie did not; for, from How- ard's jokes, Shakespearian quotations, the quiet pleas- ures of the invalid Duncan, and the active sports of the younger boys. to the infantile frolics of Fairy Em, Mr. Leshe was ever ready to sympathize and par- ticipate with them all, and his return from the city was always hailed with delight by his children. He did not think that it derogated in the least from his dignity to join in their sports, or be interested in their interests. At the -same time he always main- tained his authority. "If papa says a thing must be done, you know it must, Harry," said Algernon to the fiery little fellow one day, when he was trying to shun some task his father had required of him. It was perfectly well understood by all the chil- dren, that papa must be 'obeyed, not in fear, but in love. Obedience secured, the relation between father and children was a delightful one. It was a great comfort to Mrs. Leslie that it was so. Her health was quite delicate, so much so, that in a household where the " silver lining" to the dark- est cloud was not always visible, she would have considered herself, and have been considered, an in- valid. As it was, the children, with the exception of -Duncan, only knewlthat "mamma was not very strong." He, however, knew she was a great suf- ferer, and with what a patient and cheerful spirit she bore her sufferings; for cheerful she almost uniformly was, with that true Christian cheerfulness, which so gladdens the hearts of all in the home in which it is found. Although her two first-born treasures had been suddenly taken from her by a violent disease, yet she dwelt not mournfully on the past. ,            296      STEP BY STEP,---OR, Under these circumstances, Mr. Leslie's aid was invaluable to her. He never came from the city too much fatigued or harassed to enjoy his children's society. On the contrary, his excellent health, good spirits, and unselfish Christian love for his children, enabled him to enter into their joys and sorrows, and for a season to become a child with them. He never considered that his duty to them was ended when he had made all necessary provision for their physical wants. He understood his marriage vows to his wife in a far higher and holier sense than that. It was his pleasure, while he regarded it as his sacred duty, to relieve her as much as it was in his power, of the weight of responsibility, which every conscientious mother of a family feels to be laid upon her. Hand in hand father and mother were treading together the strait and narrow way, and striving to lead their children in the same, which their own bright views of life strewed with flowers, where many others would have planted thorns and thistles.   3           DELIA ARLINGTON.       297 CHAPTER     IV. "A perfect woman, nobly planned, To warn, to comfort, and command, And yet a spirit still and bright, With something of an angel light." WORDSWORTH. DELIA had not been long a resident in her aunt's family, before she was impressed with the quietness and regularity with which all its affairs and arrange- ments were conducted. There seemed to be no fric- tion in its well ordered machinery; no undercurrent of discontent among the servants; no fretful, fault- finding employers. Both Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, in their dealings with their dependants, acted on the broad principle of brotherly love; they believed that good masters and mistresses made good servants. Of course, as there are exceptions to all general rules, they were some- times deceived, and  their confidence sometimes betrayed; but such instances were rare. As it was generally known that they employed only faithful and trusty persons, they were seldom troubled with applications from others. "Order, heaven's first law," was fully observed in this Christian household. All, even little Fairy, as far as practicable with her, were trained to habits of punctuality and system. Delia found it very easy, and, indeed, a pleasure, to conform to the simple family arrangements. She was astonished to see how much could be effected by her aunt, and that   298      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, with so little apparent effort, by her practice of gath- ering up and using with wise forethought every golden grain of the sands of time, which so many recklessly scatter hither and thither, as if they possessed no value, or could be turned to no account. In a very little while she found herself as much at home as if she had been born and brought up under Mr. Leslie's roof. . She went into Boston daily to school, and although she missed the society of Helen Temple and Adie Lawton, she was very happy in pursuing her studies; and while at home she had no lack of interests or enjoyments.- Her aunt's quiet and unpretending manner, her strength of principle, her Christian character, and her warm and affectionate heart, made her that invaluable friend which she so much needed; while in Mr. Leslie she found a judicious guardian and counsellor, who did not hesitate, in his frank, manly way, to advise her, or to point out any faults which he noticed in her, treating her in this particular as one of his own children. Howard and Duncan proved delightful companions,-the one, by his genial good nature, quickening and calling into action her hitherto almost dormant liveliness of temperament; the other, ever ready in her more contemplative moods for grave conversation, or the quiet walk. Differing as these two brothers did from each other in many character- istics, they were alike in the nobleness of their natures and in the loftiness of their principles of action. Howard, indeed, was the life of the house, and the favorite of all, from the invalid Duncan to Fairy Em, since he could not only laugh and sport with and at them, but could also be the kind, obliging, elder brother.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      299 "Aunt Mary," said Delia, one day, as she was sit- ting alone with the former, " it puzzles me how one so full of life and fun as Cousin Howard, can be so considerate as he is. I never saw such a boy; in the midst of one of his liveliest sallies he catches the slightest shade of disapproval on your face, or of trouble on Duncan's; and he seems to know by intu- ition, when it will relieve you to have the other children amused; indeed, he knows just when to do a kindness to any one. I know he is right good-hearted, but I should not suppose he would be so thoughtful with such gay spirits." "At Duncan's age he was not, my dear, particularly thoughtful; but of late, and especially during the past year, this change has taken place in him. I attribute it, so far as he is concerned, to the serious considera- tion he gave to the subject of his duties, previous to becoming a member of the church." "A member of the church, aunt?" "Yes, my dear; does that surprise you?  "I confess it does; I never should have thought it; although I think Howard is good, very good and noble. Is he not very young?" "Younger, perhaps, than manry who unite with the church. But he, and likewise his brothers, have been educated with that in view, as soon as they arrive at an age to take the step deliberately and conscien- tiously, and to understand their duties and relations to their God and Saviour. If our religion is anything to us, it is everything, as our -good pastor often tells us. It is the one thing needful; and we have endeav- ored to teach our children to feel that an open pro- fession of Christ as Lord, and Master, and Saviour, was the first important act to be done at the outset of   300      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, life, - an indispensable preparation to entering upon its labors and duties, its trials and enjoyments.' We consecrated our children to God in their infancy, by the sprinkling of the waters of baptism, 'in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,' thereby pledging ourselves to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and under a deep sense of our responsibility, we have sought so to fulfil our duties towards them, that, at a suitable age, they shall, by their own voluntary act, become living members in the body of Christ. I do not wonder, however, my dear, that you are surprised at Howard's interest in religion, for notwithstanding our most earnest and constant efforts from his infancy, to inculcate upon him our views, and awaken in him a sense of his religious duties and obligations, I was never satisfied, until about a year ago, that any per- manent impression had been made. He was always so gay, so quick to see the absurd in everything, so full of spirits and activity, and so reserved in the expression of his deeper feelings, that I almost trem- bled for the success of our endeavors. "But a year ago last month, on his fifteenth birth- day, he came to my room when he knew I was alone, and told me that he wanted my advice upon a subject of deep interest to him ; and went on to say that he had latterly been thinking very seriously of his relig- ious obligations, and then asked me if I thought it advisable for him to unite with the church; at the same time adding, that he would rather postpone it for another year, if I was willing; as, although it was a subject much in his mind, he would like to give to it more attention than he hitherto had done, and converse with his father and myself upon sev-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      301 eral points that perplexed him. I told him I was willing he should take time for a more full consider- ation of the subject, and expressed to him my great pleasure that he had been so seriously reflecting on his duty; and I also informed him of my previous fears. "Why mother,' he answered, 4 how did you sup- pose I could be so happy and gay all this time, if I did not love God, and how did you suppose I could be so insensible to all I had been taught from my earliest recollection?' I gave him in reply the same reasons I have given you. "He then told me that the religious instruction we had given him, was what made him enjoy everything so much. ' Now mother,' said he, ' I hope you do not think it wrong for me to be lively and merry, or have a little fun with my brothers and at Aunt Charlotte. I would not for the world do anything to pain them, you know. If it is wrong for me to do as I do, how could I be so light-hearted and happy? And this is such a beautiful world, dearest mother, and there is so much goodness in it, and I am so young, and healthy, and active, I don't see why I can't be merry and love God too, with all my heart, and mind, and strength. Indeed, I do love God; and I desire to serve him constantly, and if I know myself, it is my first aim in life, and I try to follow my Saviour's example; but I know I am thoughtless, mother, and I want you to advise and check me as I need it.' "I told him I was glad he swas taking such cheer- ful views of religion, and that I did not think there was any harm in his indulging his love of fun within certain li'mits, but I did not approve, - for I consid- ered it wrong under any circumstances whatever, - 26   3U2      STEP BY STEP,---OR, of his making sport of other people, and I hoped he would check that propensity. But he cannot always restrain himself, as you perceive, although he never fails to heed a word or a look from me. a From the period of that conversation, there has been a marked change in him, not particularly in his gayety or liveliness, but in his increased thoughtful- ness of others; and upon attaining to his sixteenth year last month, I felt that he had given the subject sufficient consideration to allow him to come forward and openly acknowledge the Lord and Master, to whose service he was already devoted. "It was a holy day to us all. Even the younger boys were impressed by it. Never did Howard seem so dear to me, never did I so feel myself blest among women in having him for a son, as on that day when he made a public profession of discipleship to Christ the Son, and of the devotion of his best powers to the service of God the Father. I felt, we all felt, that the Holy Spirit was present with us, and that the offering that was made on earth was accepted in heaven. Of course the change which religion has wrought in Howard, is inward rather than outward; it has given a new direction to his aims and pur- poses, while it has left his natural temperament and characteristics about as they were before. I should not have urged him to the step at present, although I cannot tell you how much joy it gave me that he should take it in the very bud and promise of his early youth." " And Duncan, dear aunt?" "He is less hopeful in his nature than Howard, and rather shrinks at present from a public avowal of what has long been- to him a subject of deep interest;       DELIA ARLINGTON.       303 for although two years younger than his brother, his character is comparatively more mature, in conse- quence, probably,' of his sufferings. I hope, however, that soon he will so far have o'vercome his self-dis- trust and diffidence, as to take, his place among the professed disciples of the Saviour. Your Uncle Ed- ward, my dear Delia, told me of your experiences, of your doubts, difficulties and trials, and of the fruit borne last summer in testimony of the working of the Divine Spirit within you.- I trust you are at peace now." "Oh yes, Aunt Mary, and I almost wonder at my former doubts. I could not now but have faith in that religion which wrought such a change in my Cousin Fred." "There are many and many like you, my child, who, on account of the peculiar constitutions of their minds, are obliged to go through a similar process of doubt and anxiety, being, for a time, under the clouds, and in thick darkness; but 'upon all such, if, they are only true to themselves, the Sun of Righteousness is sure to shine at last, and with a most glorious light. All are not like Howard, pos- sessed of a temperament at once so joyous and trust. ing, as to know little or nothing of the perplexities and anxious questionings with which some are dis- tracted and tormented. After the experience you have had, Delia, and with such results, are you not prepared to take the step which Howard has taken?" "Not yet, aunt, not yet. May I not defer it for a year?   Perhaps Duncan and I will then come to- gether." "I would have you consult your own feelings, my dear, and act with due deliberation, never forgetting,   304      STEP BY STEP,----OR, however, that such an acknowledgment of the Saviour is a duty which all are bound to fulfil, and that it should not be postponed in the case of any in- dividual who sincerely desires to be his disciple, without a good and sufficient reason. Indeed, I at- tach a great importance and significance to the ordi- nances of our religion. To me they are not forms, but means, just as prayer is a means, and thus helps in the formation of the Christian character. Through them, the Holy Spirit comes down into our souls; at least, I think so; still I would not have you or any one else act hastily, or thoughtlessly in the matter. It is too sacred a thing not to be done soberly, seriously, and in the fear of God. I will only add, that I greatly rejoice at every young lamb received into the fold of the Good Shepherd." After this conversation with her aunt, there came to be a new and very tender relation established be- tween them, and Delia found a very great pleasure in conversing with her and Duncan upon those subjects, which, in this household, were held to be of the first and deepest importance. Religion, it was considered, added to the innocent enjoyments and rational pleas- ures of life, and was not a concern to be postponed until old age or sorrow should show what a broken reed to lean upon one's own strength is. Delia was very fond of riding on horseback, an ac- complishment which she had not paid much attention to since she left Buffalo. Her uncle had purchased a horse for her previous to leaving R , and requested her to ride every day it was practicable. He knew such exercise would be good for her health, and would serve also to exhilarate her spirits. Her hour for riding was usually before sunset, ac-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      305  companied either by her Uncle William, or Howard, or Duncan. After practice had accustomed her to the management of her horse, she found a keen en- joyment in a canter with Howard, who, now that Duncan was confined more within doors as the sea- son grew later, and Mr. Leslia was detained by his business longer in the city, was almost always her companion. One gloomy day in November, Howard came in, at the appointed time, and found Delia book in hand by the fire in his mother's little sitting-room up stairs, unprepared for her usual ride. "All ready, cousin mine? Your horse is waiting at the door, and your humble servant is waiting be- fore you; will you mount and away?" "To-day, Howard!" answered Delia abstractedly. "I think this is one of the days when it's best to stay at home." "And read the rhyme of the Duchess May," said he, looking over her shoulder. "No, my cousin fair, I protest you shall not read that to-day. Wait till the sun shines, then if you've a fancy for curdling all the blood in your veins, you may; but now come with me, and we'll see if I can't put a little color into your cheeks." With a half sigh, as her aunt, who was present, said nothing to dissuade her, Delia laid down her book, and went to dress for the ride. As they mounted, Howard said, "Now, Delia, away with 'The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy.' " "I'm not melancholy; but it is a dull day, and oh, 26*   306      STEP BY STEP,--OR, how biting the air is. November chill and drear; it was pleasanter at home, Howard." "Perhaps so; but scarcely as good for you as this ride will be. Here's a good level road, and no rail- road crossings; now for it." And putting their horses to the top of their speed, away they cantered, and when Delia checked hers in imitation of her cousin, upon entering a more thickly settled part of the town, her cheek was flushed and her eye was bright from excitement and pleasure. "I told you so," said Howard. "' There's pleasure to be extracted, even from this chill out-door air, and health, likewise, which is better still. Now, cousin, we'll have a quiet trot through what was a beautiful wood last summer; but now the leaves all have been scattered by the wind, their mission fulfilled. I con- fess, Delia, I am not partial to this season of the year, while I grant it has its lessons, which perhaps I ought to be more ready to learn." "Yes, Howard, every season has its lessons, if we are only disposed to learn them; but I prefer the beauty and gladness of spring to the dreary aspect of the dying year. How the wind moans through the leafless branches of those trees." "It is best, I suppose, to learn the lesson which the present season, or the present event, whatever it be, is designed to teach. If it was always spring time, a gay boy like me would never reflect, perhaps, that decay and death are the inevitable doom of our bodies as well as of nature. In autumn, especially in such a day as this, I always feel a subdued cheer- fulness, and I am more disposed to be thoughtful. But perhaps you think, Delia, I am never that." "Thoughtful! Oh, no. I did think so at first, but I don't now; beside, your mother told me- "   DELIA ARLINGTON.      307 "Told you that I was a communicant, and you were surprised at it?" "Yes, I was, but I am no longer so. I should like to catch some of your spirit, Howard; I should like to be always cheerful and lively, and at the same time feel as deeply, as I ought, my religious duties." "I suppose your temperament is different from mine, Delia, and your experience of life has been more sad. But I do not understand, and I see no reason, why religion should make one sad or gloomy. The hymn reads: ' Religion never was designed To make our pleasures less;' and I am sure I enjoy everything tenfold more, since I have been giving serious thought to the subject, and voluntarily taken upon myself the obligations and responsibilities involved in it. But, Delia, we have all been educated in such a way, that to me, it was the most natural thing in the world to become a professed disciple of Christ. You know the exam. ple of my father and mother goes hand in hand with their instructions; and since we have not only seen the beauty and excellency of religion, but have seen, also, the power thereof exemplified in lives so useful, and honored, as both our parents have been, I don't know how we could ever be anything else than relig- ious ourselves. Why, Delia, you don't half know my father or mother yet. My father has a great deal of business to attend to, and you see what he is to us at home, how cheerful he always is, how he is inter. ested in all our sports, as well as duties and studies. Our minister often- says, if he only had a few more men like father, he could accomplish almost any- thing he wished in the parish. He is superintendent   308      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, of the Sunday School, you know; then he is always present at the weekly Bible class; and beside, every- body says, he has done a great deal for the intellec- tual and moral improvement of the people in this vicinity. And my mother, oh; Delia, you can't tell," said the enthusiastic boy, " how I love my mother! and in loving her, I seem to be loving the embodi- ment of goodness itself. I suppose she has faults, for she is human, but I can't imagine what they are. When I was a little boy, I always thought her like the angels in heaven, and I do not .think her any less so now, since I have seen how sweetly she bears all my Aunt Charlotte's fretfulness, and discontent. She could never do it, if she wasn't a true Christian, I am very certain; she might be ever so amiable, and that would not give her patience with Aunt Char- lotte; I know it wouldn't." Delia half smiled at Howard's earnestness, and said: "Do you think that the only proof of your mother's goodness?" "Oh, no; but I don't think with my father and mother's opinion of the duty, as well as the desirable- ness of taking cheerful views of life, that there could be a greater trial than the constant society of a per- son who is so gloomy, and who, if the least cloud is to be seen in the sky, is sure to spy it out, and keep looking at it, if everywhere else it is most glorious sunshine. Well, I have seen' how my mother bears all this; how kind and patient she is with the ser- vants; how gentle and loving she is to us all, never seeming to think of herself in the least. I know this must be the fruit which, according to our Saviour, distinguishes the good from the evil. But my mother   DELIA ARLINGTON.      309 doesn't know all this. Duncan can say anything to her; but I,- I reverence her so much, I dare not tell her, that it is her example, and holy life, which has made me, from my earliest recollection, love virtue and hate evil." "She would rejoice to know that such were your feelings, would she not?" "Perhaps so, but then she is so humble; and I, when my tongue is unloosed, I am so enthusiastic, --some time I shall tell her, how much I owe her. Now, Delia, I want to tell you, how for years I have longed for a sister, to whom I could talk freely of everything; will you be a sister to me?" "If you will be a brother to me?" "With all my heart; and remember, that a true sister's part is to warn and reprove, as well as to encourage and cheer." "And a true brother's part the same, is it not, Howard?"  "Yes, oh yes; I am  for equal rights and privi- leges, and I will be as faithful to you as you can wish.  I shall try, in the first place, to make a merry, happy girl of you, Delia; and that accomplished, I will bring you back to the golden mean I myself have so successfully attained, between gayety and sadness," said he laughing. "Now, for a canter home, sweet home."           ! ,   310      STEP BY STEP,--OR, CHAPTER V. ' Light on thy hills, Jerusalem! The Saviour now is born; And light on Bethlehem's joyous plains Breaks the first Christmas morn." E. H. SEARS. DAYS, weeks, and even months were fleeting away, and Delia thought each, period of time all too short for its duties and pleasures. Never, even in her hap- piest days under her father's roof, had she known such sweet content and peace, as she was now enjoying; for she was constantly experiencing the parental care and love of her uncle and aunt, the kind and affectionate attentions of her cousins, and she was daily becoming more and more imbued with the spirit of love, and of the peace which passeth undertanding. Thanksgiving day, that time-hallowed festival of New England, had come and gone, and had been observed in Mr. Leslie's household in the spirit of true Chris- tian hospitality, as well as according to the letter. As the happy family sat down to their well spread table, and Delia looked from one beaming face to another, she knew the secret of such heart-felt joyousness as was there portrayed! each had shown his or her grati- tude to God, by doing something to make the day one of rejoicing, to the poor and friendless; and, in so doing, had made it so much the more a day of bless- ing to themselves. The chill, cloudy days of November's dreariness, had given place to the bright December sun, who   DELIA ARLINGTON.      3" performed his ever decreasing circuit through nearly the whole of the month unobscured by cloud or storm, as if to herald with gladness the day of the Saviour's advent; a day always observed by the family at Walnut Hill, as the festival of the year, to which all others were made subordinate. It was now the week preceding Christmas, and the family were all gathered in the pleasant library, where the cheerful wood fire, the shaded solar lamp, and the heavy crimson curtains, gave an air of comfort to everything. There had been a long pause, which was interrupted by Harry, who said:  Mamma, I know you don't like to have me too ' curious, but I wish I knew whether we are to have a Christmas tree this year or not, because Tom Simp- son says his father knows where to get a grand one for us if we want it." "What?" said Howard, "'a Christmas tree already filled? That's nice, to be sure." "You know I didn't mean that, How, only a tree, that's all," and Harry turned a pleading glance to his mother, who, in answer to it and his previous remark, said: "We are to discuss that question among ourselves this evening, my dear, and you ake to decide whether we are to have one or not; you collectively, I mean, not individually, Master Harry." "Well, I guess we shall have the tree then, for I don't believe there's one here but wants it." I "You shall decide, after your father has stated some facts to you, whi6h it is necessary you should know first,'my children," said Mrs. Leslie. "You already know,"' said their father, "that it has been proposed to have a parish Christmas tree in   312      STEP BY STEP,- OR, - Hall, especially for the Sunday School children, and the poorer members of the Society." "Yes, sir," said Harry, "we know it."  Well, this having a parish tree need not necessa- rily interfere with; ours, my children; but as you have in years past had a tree, and will probably be able to have one in the future, would it not be better to give the time and a part of the money, which would be expended on ours, to the Sunday School tree? It is wished to make each of the poorer children two pres- ents,- one of something useful, and another of a book or a toy. To do this will require quite an out- lay. Now, whatever your mother's and my wishes or feelings may be upon the subject, we desire you to act independently of them, and not to vote against a tree at home, unless you really and conscientiously prefer not to have one. You are all voters, including Delia and Aunt Charlotte." "I'm sure I shan't vote either way, brother Wil- liam," broke in Mrs. Norton, with some asperity. "In my day, we didn't have such follies and German notions; and I rather think we were as happy and as well brought up as the young folks now-a-days. If I vote, it will be against any tree at all." "Well, we will take the vote then, for a tree at home, the Sunday School tree, or no tree at all. Now, who are in favor, of the home tree? Be honest all, and vote as you wish.' No hand was raised save Harry's, whose face was overcast with conflicting feelings. HeI was generous and noble spirited, and quite equal to making as, great a sacrifice as this, after due deliberation; but he was also a boy of transparent truthfulness, and just now, he could not feel quite reconciled to giving up the   DELIA ARLINGTON.      313 home tree, and he knew he ought to vote as he felt. His father understood his character and motives, and did not, as some parents might have done, reprove him for his selfishness, but said: "Right, my little man; be true to yourself always. Now, who are in favor of the Sunday School tree?" Every hand was raised but Mrs. Norton's, and, to Delia's surprise, Algernon's. "' Now, who go for no tree at all? That's right, now we have the honest expression of everybody's opinion. One vote for the home tree, five for the Sunday School tree, and two for no tree at all. The Sunday School tree carries the day." There was now a general buzz of inquiry among the little ones, who were crowding round their mother's chair. Delia said to Howard, "I am surprised at the vote taken." "I am not, I could have told you just how it would be; for though Harry was longing to make the sacri- fice of his inclinations, his entire openness and sin- cerity would not let him. Of course, Duncan and I could not vote otherwise than we did, and your vote was consistent."' "But Algernon, how could he vote as he did?" "Ah, you don't understand him yet, I see. He is not always in the slough of despond, like Aunt Char- lotte; but my little gentleman has very rigid notions about many things, and his theology is of the most severe order, and he really doesn't think such things are desirable or good for young people, although he himself enjoys them. If he were a Roman Catholic by birth and education, I doubt not he would become a monk of the order of S,t. Francis. His vote ex- 27 I   1i4     STEP BY STEP,--OR, plained, is your wonder over? Of course, Aunt Char- lotte's would not have been a matter of astonishment, without her sharp protest at the commencement." "Why, Eddie and Gilbert are such pleasure-loving little fellows, I thought they would follow Harry, and vote for the home tree." "You don't know the brothers Cheeryble, yet, Delia; as full of fun and frolic as they are at times and most always, I confess, they are the kindest hearted, most disinterested little creatures you ever knew, and are both animated by one spirit. If they don't grow up fac-similes of Dickens's incompara- ble twins, I'm mistaken. Look at their happy, full moon faces, and their eyes sparkling with delight, as mother is telling them, I'll be bound, what they can do for the Sunday School tree. Nobody will work harder, though, than our Hal; there'll be no end to the evergreens he and his friend Tom Simpson will ferret out in the woods for the decorations." "Here comes Algernon Sidney Leslie," said How- ard, rising and bowing low to his grave, but good- natured younger brother." Our cousin, Ally, has been expressing her astonishment at your vote; will you condescend to explain to her the motives which actuated your most worshipful gentlemanship?" "You know, Cousin Delia," said Algernon, com- posedly seating himself beside her, "that Howard makes fun of us all, but we don't care, because he is really such a good fellow. I don't see why I should not have my opinion as well as he his; now I don't think it is good for young people to have so many amusements and pleasures, it distracts their minds and attention from their studies and duties." "Hear, hear," said Howard.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      315 "I think, too," continued Algernon, that time is too precious to be wasted in this way, and besides, I don't believe by so much gayety we can best celebrate the Saviour's birth." "But," said Delia, "it certainly is a season for gladness and gratitude, and I don't see how we can better show our gratitude than by our efforts to make others happy. This Christmas tree will surely do that." "Oh, it would do very well if the poor children only were to have gifts," replied the sturdy little ascetic.. "They don't have many pleasures, I know, but all the Sunday School scholars will be there, and they all will have gifts and a merry time, and Ithink children like us have too many pleasures already. At least," said he, with a gravity that would have been ludicrous but for its evident sincerity, " it is not good for me to have so many indulgences. I don't think I shall go to the Hall on Christmas Eve." "You are a queer one, Ally," said Howard, laugh- ing; ", but, as you say, you have just as good a right to your opinion as I have to mine, only take care not to see things through Aunt Charlotte's spectacles, instead of your own clear eyes. That would be a sad mistake." "I agree with Aunt Charlotte much more than you do, Howard, but I do not like all her notions; so I am not very likely to use her spectacles till they fit me." "Which they will soon, my very precocious brother, if you go on at this rate." "Delia, did you ever observe that Ally is the only one of us all who has not curly hair?" said Howard, turning to his cousin, and at the same time running /   316      STEP BY STEP,- OR, his fingers through the dark brown curls, which, short and thick, clustered around his manly, open brow. "4 There's Duncan with his chestnut curls, Harry with his dark auburn, Cheeryble brothers with their ring- lets, 'rather dark than fair,' and Fairy Em, with hers of golden hue, and in contrast with all, Ally's straight, proper, gentlemanly hair, which is never out of place, never in disorder." s Yes," answered Delia, "I have noticed it. How do you account for it?" "On the principle that Dame Nature knows where to bestow her favors, or rather knows where they will be appreciated. Think you so proper and precise a head as Master Algernon carries, could brook an adorning of curls?" "You are ingenious, Howard, at least; one: thing must be said of Algernon, if he is rather too rigid in his notions for one of his years, he is the best tem- pered boy 1 ever saw," said Delia, as Ally, after lis- tening smilingly to his brother's last sally, moved off to join the band at the table. "That he is, Delia, a sterling good fellow too; I wouldn't tease him for the world, if it really did tease him. But, I think, although my bantering doesn't appear to have much effect now, that perhaps it may, some time or other, and cure him of some of his strange ideas. He takes kindly to Aunt Charlotte, and she, I believe, considers him the only one among us not past redemption; that is,'she tries to think so with her understanding, but in her heart there is a kind little nook for us all, I guess. Come, let's join the party at the table." The following week was a busy one at Walnut Hill. All the leisure Delia could command she em-   DELIA ARLINGTON.      317 ployed in assisting her aunt to make useful and comfortable articles for the tree, while Duncan was industriously exercising his taste and ingenuity in various pretty devices for the same purpose. Howard, whose skill in fine carpentry was unques- tioned, labored hard in his little work room in the manufacture of articles both useful and ornamental; while Harry, as he had prophesied, was indefatigable in his researches for evergreens. As near an approach to a cloud as was ever seen on their happy faces, rested on the twins as they pon- dered what they could do that would be of service in any way. They finally were obliged to resort to mamma for advice, who told them they could prepare some bits of paper for labels, and giving them direc- tions, set them to work, much to their relief, although they privately expressed to each other the opinion, that what they were doing was not much, after all. They, however, after a good deal of deliberation to- gether, concluded they would purchase books with their own money for two little boys near their own age, 4"4who have such a bad mamma," said Gilbert, who was speaker, " and only think, Eddie, no papa at all." "Perhaps we might get something better than books for them," said Eddie. "I don't think they know how to read." "Well, we'll ask mamma, she always knows what's best; only what we get shall be marked with their names in full,- Samuel and George Robbins,-that I'm determined upon."  The next day, when Mrs. Leslie and Delia were busy at work on their preparations, Aunt. Charlotte came in. 27*   318      STEP BY STEP,-- OR '"On second thoughts, sister Mary," said she, "I don't disapprove of making up things that are really useful for poor people, so I'll help you, if there is any- thing that I can do. No, I'll not take a sleeve, give me a whole garment to make. This will do some poor creature good, I hope, and cheer her awhile in this cold and dark world; but," seating herself reso- lutely to the double gown Mrs. Leshe had given her, "I hold to the same mind about the tree and the other nonsense that I did at first. I don't see the sense of it, and I think that men, women and chil- dren, who are all' born to trouble as the sparks fly upward,' better be about something else, than follow- ing foreign fashions, setting up trees in houses and putting little bits of candles in them, and all such sorts of gimcrackery. No such doings in my days," she added triumphantly, with a jerk of the head. "Perhaps if there had been, Aunt Charlotte, your feelings would have been more kindly towards your race, and more lenient towards yourself than they are now," thought Mrs. Leslie, as she remembered her husband's description of the strict puritanical home of his boyhood, where almost in the wilds of New Hampshire, in a lone farm-house, he with his brothers and sisters was brought up after the manner of the straitest of the sects of that day, in a God-fearing manner, it is true, but with little or no reference to the wants of their social natures. Mr. Leslie's fondness for study, and his sex, not to say his temperament also, saved him on the one hand, from imbibing gloomy, one-sided views of life, a natural enough effect of his early education; and on the other, from rushing into the opposite extreme of recklessness, a not unfrequent reaction from such a bringing up as ".   DELIA ARLINGTON.      3 19 he had. Beside which, he left his New Hampshire home before his character was fully formed, or his notions and views fixed, and the more genial influ- ence into the midst of which his good fortune brought him, acting upon the nobler tendencies of his nature, served to develope and strengthen what was purest and best in him. But not so with Mrs. Norton. Remaining with her parents until her marriage, and possessed of an active mind, and a naturally desponding tempera- ment, the religious education they gave her, having in it scarcely any of the element of cheerfulness or hope, made her the sad and gloomy woman she was. And the evil was not confined to herself, for she car- ried the cloud that overcast her own existence where. ever she went, and it never failed to throw some portion of its dark shadow upon those around her. ' In reply to Mrs. Norton's remarks, Mrs. Leslie merely said she thought some recreation necessary to the young, although she was willing to acknowledge, -, that at the present day there was altogether Joo much time and attention given to supplying chkidren with amusements merely. She seldom argued with her sister-in-law, having long since found its uselessness, but she generally managed after a while to turn the conversation to topics upon which they could agree, although there was never any long space of time in- tervening before Mrs. Norton was sure to introduce some of her peculiar views. It was decided to have the Sunday School tree on the evening of Christmas day, rather than on Christ- mas Eve, in order that the poorer people, who seldom had any enjoyment of the kind, might be present, and in the future have pleasant associations with the   320      STEP BY STEP,--OR, day. The night previous, a soft falling snow had enveloped the earth in a robe of spotless white, as'if in honor of him who-came, - ,' The broken heart to bind, The bleeding soul to cure; And with the treasures of his grace To enrich the humble poor." But Christmas morning shone bright and clear, as if inviting all hearts to join in the soul-stirring anthem,--- "All glory be to God on High, And to the earth be peace! Good will henceforth from Heaven to men Begin and never cease." At an early hour, before the last rays of the setting sun had withdrawn their glad beams, the company began to assemble in --  Hall. Great efforts had been made to secure the presence of those for whom this occasion had been especially designed. Private carriages were sent into the lanes and bye-ways to the dwellings of the poor, the infirm and the sorrow- ing, who are to be found even in our most flourishing and prosperous New England villages. Children with their glad faces and merry voices came trooping in, young men and maidens in the first blush of man- hood and womanhood came also, and the parents and elder members of the parish completed the conm- pany. A Christmas hymn was sung, a few words of Chris- tian welcome were addressed to the assembly by the pastor, when a curtain at one end of the hall was drawn aside, and the Christmas tree with its ap- parently countless lights and gifts for all, stood reveal-   DELIA- ARLINGTON.     321 ed to expectant eyes. After it had been gazed upon and admired for a sufficient length of time, a distri- bution of its treasures took place; and those for whom they were particularly intended found themselves in possession of some useful article, and some tasteful or ornamental one also. A warm flannel gown and a good book was laid aside for pious bed-ridden Mrs. Jones; a thick shawl, and a smart apron to kind Nurse Truman; a pair of spectacles to suit old age, and a religious newspaper for the year to good father West, who seldom in cold weather ventured beyond his daughter's door; sacks, aprons, mittens, and tippets, with books, toys, and bags of sugar plums gladdened the hearts of children, whose lot in life had not been cast in abundance; while those who always received gifts at home, had some trifling article only, for a remembrance of the occasion. Tom Simpson, Harry's friend, who was the only son of a poor widowed washwoman, found himself the owner of a warm sack and a little cart, very like the one he had so unintentionally broken for Harry on our first acquaintance with the latter, and which was easily traced to Howard's handy- work. Sweet Susan Lee, the now ten years' invalid, (and the most gentle and patient of invalids she was,) - having been confined to her bed for that space of time by a spinal affection,- -had, in addition to a pretty pink and brown double gown, (Aunt Char- lotte's own manufacture,) a book of mosses and pressed autumn leaves, which Duncan's tasteful skill and industry had prepared for her; for although of an humble birth and lowly rank in life, she possessed an unusual love of the beautiful, and refined tastes. Not- withstanding, Aunt Charlotte growled out, "better   322      STEP .BY STEP, - OR, get her something useful, than make that silly thing for a girl that may die any time," Duncan, with his mother's approbation, persevered in his labor of love and kindness. He knew Susan Lee was never in need of whatever - her necessities, or her comforts re. quired; for was not every one who knew her, ready to minister to her wants? Few there were in .--. who did not know her, and with what cheerful Chris- tian endurance she had borne her great sufferings, and, what is almost as hard, bodily unrest for a period extending back to her early girlhood. In addition to the warm coats provided for Masters Samuel and George Robbins, both special objects of interest to the twins, each found himself the owner of a brilliant red sled with his own name painted in full black letters, and which no one, excepting themselves and their mother, knew to be the gifts of Howard's brothers Cheeryble. Mrs. Robbins was prevailed upon to keep sober for that day, and she received a nice warm dress, and a pretty Bible, given in the hope, that possibly kindness might induce her to turn from her evil habits, but even if it should not, that the celebration of the birth of Him, who came to seek and to save the lost, should not be the occasion when any were neglected on ac- count of their transgressions. Time sped rapidly to all that Christmas party, and if there were some dissatisfied faces, and grumbling voices,- as where is there a joyous occasion without any shadow? - the bright happy countenances of the majority bore witness that the experiment had been a successful one. As Delia looked around upon the joyous company, she thought how much nobler such a Christmas festival was, than the expenditure of   DELIA ARLINGTON.      323 large sums of money upon splendid entertainments given to those who are able to repay in kind. "This surely," she thought, "was Christ's feast, this surely was a foretaste of heaven, where the rich and the poor shall meet together, each alike the ob- ject of the same divine love, and member of the same holy family, and the poor distinctions of earth are unknown. 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto- one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."' An abundant repast, and a prayer by the pastor, ended the occasion, which was long remembered by all who were present.   -324        STEP BY STEP --OR, CHAPTER VI.

"Soberly, seriously, and sincerely, Delia, you can't tell how much I miss you, and I know our teacher and Helen Temple at least, sympathize with me, for they often speak of you in terms, - well, not displeasing to me to hear. "Helen makes the dearest of teachers in music and drawing that you can imagine, and even your Cousin Clara (who, by the way, has somewhat improved, I think,) treats her with the respect due to her sweet unpretending manners.

He has actually left St. Church, and is a devout attendant upon the Rev. Dr. -- preach- ing; but he looks very unhappy. Mother says he will scarcely find the peace he is seeking by changing his place of worship; what he needs, she says, does not depend upon place. A friend of   DELIA ARLINGTON.          325 mother's, who is a worshipper at Dr. -- church, told her that her pastor says ' that Judge Grafton is laboring under the very com- mon delusion, that he is, some way or other, to be acted upon by creeds and outward observances, rather than by the- Divine Spirit working within him, renewing his heart and changing his life. I don't understand much about these things, you know, but I do pity the Judge from the bottom of my heart, and I respect him more than I once did. Mother says she hopes he will not become a gloomy fanatic, which appears to be his present danger. "Do you really like the quiet life you are leading in the coun- try? I like the country in summer, but in the winter I very much prefer the noise and confusion of the city. We have never exchanged vows of friendship, Delia, but you know I like you better than any other-girl I ever saw; there's for you. So, will you not write to me once in a while? O Delia, there are times when I feel within me the promptings of something nobler and better than my present life, and perhaps you can aid me in my endeavors to turn it to account. But alas! poor me, I find it so much easier to live as I am doing just now, and it's so much trouble to puzzle out all the mysteries about us, and while I don't do anything very wicked, may-be I shall get along as thousands of others do. I do wish, however, I could feel as my dear mother does. She's a Christian, I am sure. By the way, how is the paragon? Let me hear your first impressions, and write soon to your wayward, but "Sincere friend, ADIE LAWTON." Delia smiled and sighed as she read the above characteristic letter, and was both pleased and grieved at its contents. She was glad to hear from Adie; glad that she had any influence with one whose character had such a substantial basis of good prin- ciple and good feeling, and it was a great gratification to her to know that she held such an honorable place in her teacher's regards. But she was greatly grieved on-account of Judge Grafton.    "Could she be any comfort to him?" she asked herself; " or could she in any way aid him   in finding that peace which she knew he was seeking for, but did not possess?' 28 J     /   a2t      STEP BY STEP,--OR, How strange that she should be asking herself such questions, she thought, when she recollected who Judge Grafton was, and who she was. That death-bed at Greenville justified any such questions. As she reflected upon what Adie had written about him, she saw there was nothing she could do for him at present but pray for him, that oil might be poured by God's own hand into the bleed- ing wounds of his heart, and light from on high might come down upon his darkened spirit. This was all she could do, and this she would not neglect. Delia was a little amused at Adie's request respect- ing her (first impressions' of the paragon, as the latter persevered in styling Melville Temple. Those first impressions had not been very favorable, as it has been seen, and Melville's manners towards her were not calculated to change them. With little acquaintance with young girls of her age, he thought them, as a class, frivolous and insipid. Marking, as he did, Delia's natural hauteur, which she was not able to throw off at once, and witnessing her unre- strained mirth when Howard exerted himself to bring her down from her throne of' state, as he styled her haughty moods, he came to regard her as a vain school- girl, who assumed airs of consequence which she had not sufficient dignity of character to support, since she could in the same hour, be the mere formal young lady and the frolicking child. He attributed his moth- er's and sister's partiality for her to the circumstances of her situation, which had excited their sympathy. Such misapprehension of character is not infrequent, even among persons who live on terms of intimate, neighborly acquaintance, and it was not at all un- natural with two young people possessed of more  .     - -   '       DELIA ARLINGTON.      327 than ordinary independence of character. They both saw each other, however, through the meaium of their own previously formed opinions, which they did not give their judgments opportunity to correct. One evening in January, as the family at Walnut Hill were'sitting together in the Library, which was their usual winter sitting-room, the conversation turned upon Mrs. Norton's absent son Leslie. 'Delia's curiosity had been a good deal excited about him, at the time of the Christmas tree, from hearing the chil- dren so often regret, that 'Cousin Les' was not at home, and likewise, from hearing Howard say from time to time, when anything was to be done, "If Les- lie were only here;" but she had foreborne to ask any questions about him, simply concluding that however good or useful Leslie Norton might be, he could be nothing more, if he-was a true son of his mother. This evening the children were talking about he- roes, and one and another gave his opinion as to what constituted a hero; Harry stoutly holding that a great warrior was the true hero; while Ally as sturdily main- tained that the martyr was the only true hero, and quiet Duncan contended, that heroism like Grace Dar- ling's outshone all the rest. "Then," said Harry, "Leslie is a true hero; for don't you remember, mamma, the time on board ship, when they were so nearly wrecked, and he shared his last morsel of bread with a poor Irish woman, and when help, at last, came to them, he wouldn't leave the vessel until that same woman was safe? and how : the captain told us all about it, and said he came near losing his own life, by doing so much for others? Was not that true heroism, mamma?" "That was one kind of heroism, certainly, my son, and one of the noblest kinds, too. To risk one's own *   328      STEP BY STEP--OR, life to save the life of another, and that person a stranger, is surely to love one's neighbor as one's self." "I should think you would feel proud of such a son, Aunt Charlotte?" said Howard, a little mis- chievously. "4 I can -say of Leslie, as Washington's mother said of her son, 'he was always a good boy,' as good, I mean, as one born to the inheritance of sin and woe, can be; but I am not proud of anything earthly," answered Mrs. Norton. Ic Well, I am proud of him, Aunt Charlotte, if you are not, and when he comes home in the spring, we'll have a rejoicing. He's the best fellow in the world, and Melville is the next," said Howard spring- ing up, as the door opened, and admitted the last named person. "Another hero for you, Harry: ' By his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.'" "I don't understand the joke," said Melville, cooly seating himself; "the last hero I am ambitious of imitating, is Harry Percy." "Hush, hush, Melville; he's Harry's model, and," lowering his voice, " namesake, too -so don't under- value him, if your own ambition soars not so high." "I've no ambition to be a hero of any stamp, Howard, and, in truth, I think I should make but a sorry one. My vocation in life is settled now upon the day-book and ledger, and you must confess that one who is all day long poring over their pages, is little likely to cultivate, or attain to the heroic." "' 'My mind to me a kingdom is,'" said Delia, invol- untarily.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      329 Melville started, and looked round inquiringly. "Explain yourself, Delia," said her aunt, encour- agingly. "I only meant, -I only thought," said Delia, hesitating, "that one is not obliged to bring his mind down to the level of his employment, that is, always." "No, that is not necessary," said Howard, kindly coming to her aid, "I'm not going to eat, drink, and think iron, because my future business will be to calculate the weight, and size, and diameter, and cir- cumference, of certain articles of that manufacture. No more will Melville, here, narrow his capacities down to cases of silk, and pieces of cotton, &c., because he deals in such articles." "Hold, my boy, tho fast, too fast," said his father; "Melville goes to the extreme right, and you shoot off to the extreme left. I hope you both will be good business men, and good Christians enough to give your strength and talents to whatever you under- take, and that you will not think anything beneath your attention, which will ensure you true success in it. I don't think, Melville, there is anything neces- sarily narrowing in such pursuits as you are engaged- in; indeed, I am very much of Delia's opinion, that we can make our employments elevating, or the con- trary, according to the prevailing habits of our minds." "Perhaps so," answered Melville, unconvinced, "but I think my present employment a poor ex- change for the expectations of my early years." "Nevertheless, the exchange was your own volun- tary act." "Certainly, sir, and I have never regretted it; but; 28 *   330'     STEP BY STEP,---OB, at the same time, I cannot help feeling that I have not chosen a pursuit best fitted to elevate -" "Wait till you know more of the grandeur of mercantile operations, and you will, perhaps, think differently. Now, you are- but a beginner in the dry rudiments of your intended occupation." "Well, sir, I hope you may be right; but at 'all events, heroism lies quite out of my path. I doubt, if I should meet an heroic act, waiting for me to per- form it, I should know what it meant." "Oh, Melville," said Harry, and, "Oh, Melville," said the others, in various tones of indignation, sur- prise and amazement." After Melville left, Algernon very gravely expressed the opinion that he was not ithe stuff martyrs were made of, or he would not be so easily discouraged, and Harry sighed over his disappointed expectations. "Melville has no lack of the true martyr and heroic spirit, boys, you may be sure, if I am any judge of character," said Mr. Leslie. "He finds his initiation into business dull enough, and distasteful enough, compared with his favorite pursuits; still he is determined to persevere in the sacrifice he has made for his mother's and sister's sake, a sacrifice which they would never allow him to make, if they only knew how much it cost him. There is some heroism in this, is there not, Algernon? giving up his cherished purposes from boyhood?" "I should think it a true act of heroism, and a great trial, father; but what he suffers, is nothing com- pared to the sufferings of martyrs and Christians of old," the little fellow answered. "We live in the present, my son, not in the past; I doubt if many people can be found at this day, who   DELIA ARLINGTON.      331 place a very high value on martyrdom at the stake. But our day has its trials; let us learn how to meet them, and turn them to good account. Of one thing, Howard, I feel very sure, as sure as I do of anything depending on the acts of another, and that is, that Melville will never add his name to the thousands who have defrauded their employers and abused pub- lie confidence, and that he will attend to his business in the counting-room as faithfully as he would have discharged his duties as a Christian pastor, and in the same spirit. Such men are needed in mercantile pursuits, more than in Christ's priesthood. All honor to the young man, who in these days of temptation and extravagance, and opportunities for deception, maintains his own integrity." "Shame upon him, if he didn't," said Howard. "True, my son; yet when you have experienced the temptations, which, now you think it so easy to resist, because you know nothing about them, you, perhaps, will consider him, who does not yield to them, as worthy of your respect, at least. There are times, in the history of most men, which prove their souls, and test their characters, which show, whether they are true metal, or some base alloy. You were speaking of Leslie, my boy," turning to Harry. "I believe he is-a true hero, in almost any sense of the word. I mean by that, he is a man who is not only capable of true acts of heroism, and self-denial, but one who is in the constant practice of such acts in his every-day life, and therein, I think, he and Mel- ville resemble each other, unlike as they may be in other respects." "Well," said Mrs. Norton, "they'll both find occa- sion enough for these virtues before they've got far /  ;s.   332      STEP BY STEP,--OR, along in this vale of tears. Increase has been a great comfort to me, I must say; but then there's never any telling what he may come to, yet. Sin and temptation abound in the world, and he's but a boy, after all." "Increase! what does she mean?"Delia asked Howard, in a whisper. "She means Leslie; she would persist in giving him that name after some old ancestor of the family. Luckily she added Leslie; and my father has always called him by the latter name, since he came to live with us, and my aunt usually calls him so too, ex- cept when her sky is more than usually overcast, - then she calls him Increase." "Have more faith, sister," said Mr. Leslie, almost sternly, " in your son, and in the Father, who watches over all his children, and who will not suffer any one of them to be tempted beyond what he is able to bear." Then without waiting her answer, he turned to Delia, and said, "You have yet to become ac- quainted with my nephew. I hope in the spring to. have the pleasure of introducing him to you." "( Where is he now, Sir?" "He has gone to China, on business for a mercan- tile house in the city, and will have been absent a year and a half, when he returns, as he is expected in the spring. This is his second voyage. It was on his first he met with the disaster Harry related, and proved himself a brave man, and, what is better, a true Christian."   DELIA ARLINGTON.       833 CHAPTER      VII. "And who knoweth which is best? X And I smiled to think God's greatness Flowed around our incompleteness, Round our restlessness, His rest." E. B. BARRETT. As the cold grew more severe, which it did after Christmas, Duncan's health visibly failed, and he was confined for the greater part of the time to the house, excepting in very pleasant days, when he was taken out to ride. As his feebleness became more and more apparent, Delia sometimes observed a shadow on her aunt's brow, such as her own delicate and suffering health had never caused to settle down upon it. One day, being alone with her, she ventured to ask her if she was really uneasy with regard to Duncan. "I fear," was the answer, "that he will become a confirmed invalid, my dear, and that he has before him a life of suffering and confinement, rather than one of active service in the Church of Christ. I do .not repine or murmur at what God ordains, but gladly would I myself bear my son's sickness, were' it possible, if he only might be spared its heavy trial. There is something so sad in seeing one of his age and with aims so high and holy, smitten down by disease, and cut off from all active. usefulness. I have had trials in my life, but this is the hardest to bear that I have ever known. No," she continued, as if to herself, a when my sweet babes were taken from me, I knew they were far safer in the hands of their Heavenly Father than in mine. But Duncan,- I   334      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, almost think I could part with him too, with less pain than I undergo in witnessing the slow, torturing wast- ing of disease upon him. But God's will be done. He knows what is best for us, and He can turn the darkest dispensations of his Providence into the high- est blessings." As Mrs. Leslie concluded, the door opened and Duncan entered, looking pale and exhausted, but cheerful. "Mamma," he said as he seated himself at her feet and laid his head on her lap, as was often his wont, "mamma, I know you are anxious and troubled about me, but there is no cause. I have felt myself, day by day for weeks, growing more and more feeble, and I have been striving to see how it may be good for me to be laid by in my quiet chamber, rather than be engaged in some active pursuit. I cannot quite make it all out, mamma dear, but by my struggles and prayers, I have at least learned to submit to the will of my Heavenly Father, and now I have come to tell you that I feel cheerful and happy, - do not go, Delia,- and Iwant you to help me keep so. I asked the Doctor this morning about my case; he said that while I should suffer a good deal at times probably, I should have long intervals of comparative ease. Now, mamma, I can bear pain, you know, and I want you to help me find some employment for my better days, that I may not feel myself entirely a cum-- berer of the ground. And I want you to think how much better it is that I should be in this state than Howard, who is all life and energy, and who cannot bear a single day's confinement, without, as he says, being obliged 'to sprinkle cool patience' over himself hourly. It is all right, dear mamma, and I am happy   DELIA ARLINGTON.      335 in thinking that God has given me peace instead of the health and strength others have. When I am pretty well I can do many little things to assist you, and I should like to go on with my lessons also, if you have no objection.'" This was all said in a tone so cheerful and com- posed, as if he had surveyed well the prospect before him, and knew of what he was speaking, that Mrs. Leslie felt inexpressibly relieved. Stroking back the curls from his forehead, she kissed him tenderly and said: "God forbid that I should repine, my son, if you do not. You will never be a cumberer of the ground; with your feelings and principles, that would be im- possible. Your work, and a most holy work it is, will be to teach us all how to bear our light crosses, by showing us how you bear your heavy one." "But there is one thing, mamma, unless you wish to make me unhappy, you must promise, and that is, that no one shall be kept from his duties or pleasures to wait on me. If there is anything that would make my sickness hard to bear, it would be the feeling that I was interfering with the enjoyments, or taking up the time, needlessly, of others. To be sure, when I am very bad, it must be so, I suppose; but at other times you will promise, mamma, that it shall not?" "Anly thing, may dear, in reason, that will be a comfort to you, I will promise." When it came to be known in the family that. Duncan's declining health was such as required the greatest care, each one vied with the other in kindness and attention to the dearly loved invalid. Even Fairy Em caught the prevailing feeling, and would softly stroke his cheek and play with his curls saying:   336      STEP BY STEP, -OR, "1 Poor Dun, poor Dun, tick; Fay tiss Dun well." His illness, which finally developed into a trouble- some hip complaint, prevented him from moving about as easily as formerly. He was able, however, for the most part, to go to his meals; the remainder of the day he usually passed either in his mother's little sitting-room or in his own apartment, whither all the members of the family were sure to come, from time to time, to relate to him whatever they had gleaned in their daily occupations and amuse- ments, and he had a ready and sympathizing ear for each. In the evening he generally joined the family in the library, for the circle would have been incom- plete without him at that hour, to which all looked forward for the reunion of its scattered members. An arm-chair was placed for him near his mother's corner of the sofa, and no one seeing the sweet peace- ful expression of his countenance, would have sup- posed that the most ardent desires of a deeply enthusiastic, though gentle nature, had been disap- pointed, and that even now, at times, the struggle for perfect resignation raged fiercely and bitterly within him. But so it was; and no one guessed the extent of his trial save his mother, who was almost his second self, so free and, unrestrained was their intercourse, and so sympathetic were their natures. She alone knew how strong had been his desire to preach the Gospel of Christ, a desire cherished from his earliest childhood; for to her alone had he confided his most sacred feelings. The preceding autumn he had said to her, when it was decided after much discus- sion and deliberation, that it would be unwise for him to attempt going to school the coming winter :   DELIA ARLINGTON.      337 "I will do as you think best, mamma, but you will allow me to study at home the same studies I should have pursued at school, will you not? You do not know how I long to feel that I am every day getting nearer and nearer to my life work." Knowing this as she did, it is no wonder that even that Christian mother trembled for the effect this dis- appointment of his hopes might have upon her son, and how she wished, with all her mother's unselfish love, that it were possible for her to bear his burden for him. What he had told her of his feelings, in Delia's presence, reassured her in part, and she judged it best to let some days elapse before she made any allusion to the subject again. Very quietly, indeed, were all the changes made, which his altered state of health required, and he was permitted to pursue his studies as he desired. One day, about a week after the conversation with his mother, she went into his room and found him leaning on his. little table, evidently laboring under great distress of mind. " Duncan, my son, what troubles you?" she in- quired anxiously and compassionately. "Oh, mamma," he answered, "I did not know I was so weak and so wicked before; I must tell you all, and you will at least pity me, I know. I lay awake last night a long time; I was in considerable pain, although it was not very severe, and I thought over all my past hopes and my present prospects, and some how, dear mamma, every thing looked- very dark to me, and it seemed as if some evil spirit was in- citing me to rebellion; for I felt that my lot was hard and my trial greater than I could bear; this, too, just after I thought I had gained such a victory over 29   338     STEP BY STEP,---OR, myself. I asked why I should have been so afflicted from my infancy up, and, - but I can't tell you all the wicked thoughts I had. After a time came bet- ter feelings, as I remembered my Saviour, and how much he suffered, and I considered how much I had to be grateful for, and then I prayed, and soon after fell asleep. Upon awaking this morning I felt at first that the evil spirit had left me. But now comes the worst of all, mamma, and I don't know what you will think when I tell you." He paused for a moment, but upon receiving a gentle pressure from his mother's hand, which-held his, he went on. "After breakfast I came up to my books, but my head felt so bad I could not study. Just then, How- ard came in looking so. fresh, and bright, and happy, and so strong, mamma, and then he said to me in his loud tones, ' Anything I can do for you, my boy, to- day?"  At that I felt positively angry, mamma, and I believe I almost hated him, my handsome, healthy, elder brother. But I concealed the feeling as much as I could, and answered quietly, ' Nothing, I thank you.' Something strange about me, or in the tone of my voice struck him, I suppose, for he immediately came to me, and said gently as he stroked my head, 'Poor Duncan, it is hard for you to be shut up here, but cheer up; better days are coming.' Mamma, I didn't quite hate him then, but he left me without knowing how I had felt towards him. How do I know but that similar feelings will be constantly rising up in my heart? I never envied Howard be. fore, never, although I know how superior he is to me in many things." ' My child," said his mother in tones of deep sym.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      339 pathy and love, " your sincere sorrow for your fault is one of the best safeguards you can have against the frequent recurrence of such feelings. Envy will never find a home in your pure breast, I am certain, even if it has entered there once. Now that you have seen how hateful a guest it is, I amn sure you will never harbor it again. It is' natural that you should experience many bad feelings in this time of sore trial to you, my boy, but I do not fear for the result, so long as you do not listen to the tempter's voice, and so long as your conscience so sharply re- proves you for your fault. Sad, indeed, would be our trial, for it is mine as well as yours, Duncan, if it should change the nature, or harden the heart of my gentle, loving son. Such is sometimes the effect of sickness like yours; then it is 'indeed a sore trial, turning God's *wisely intended discipline into a grievous dispensation of sorrow, making that bear only thorns and briars, which might be made to bear fruit meet for the beau- tiful gardens of Paradise. "Oh! my child, strive as you have even now striven; strive against such unholy thoughts and feel- ings; strive as you would to overcome the direst temptations of the Evil One, and it shall not be in vain, for thus shall your ' affliction, which is but for a moment, work out for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' When the few fleeting days of time are past, and we shall stand in the very pres- ence of God and the Lambj redeemed and sanctified, it may be, by passing through the furnace of afflic- tion here on earth, how light and insignificant then will appear the heaviest even of our trials in this life. Oh, if Christians would only look thus on their trials here, how much present sorrow would they be spared,   340     STEP BY STEP --OR, and what rich fragrance of sufferings, borne in faith, and joy even, would be wafted in their behalf to heaven! And you will watch and pray that hereafter God will give you strength to cast away all unholy thoughts." ( Mamma, I will do so, and I trust I shall never again give way to such sinful feelings. Until last night, if any one had said to me that I could be -en- vious of Howard, I should have answered, 'Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?" "Alas! my child, we never know when or how the tempter may come. ' Watch and pray that ye enter - not into temptation.' There is no other safeguard." "Ought I not to tell Howard how I felt towards him? It would be no more than a just humiliation of myself." "By no means, my son. The knowledge would, imbitter his young buoyant life, and he is so noble and generous, he would feel almost unhappy in the possession of that which you have not, if he should know what your feeling had been." "But he thinks me better than I am; I know he does." "Strive then to deserve his good opinion of you, as indeed I have no fear but you will. This very temptation to envy and dislike your brother, may prove in the end a true blessing, teaching you where your chief weakness lies, and where you are most in danger." "Ah! yes, mamma, I shall never want to hear any one say again, how patient and good I am; indeed I never did like to hear people say so. Do you forgive me, dearest mamma?" "Forgive you, my son? What have I to, for- give?"   DELIA, ARLINGTON.      341 "My being so false to your teachings and exam- ple." "Not so, Duncan, when you truly repent. Alas, I fear the lives of the best of people are made up of sins committed and repented of." After this confession of Duncan, Mrs. Leslie watched him narrowly, yet without seeming to do so, and was :rejoiced to perceive that the gentle and peaceful expression so habitual to him, indicated a restored tone of mind, and that he was gaining in addition that indescribably sweet look one sometimes sees in the faces of those who have fought, a great fight with their evil passions, and are rejoicing in lowly humility of spirit at the victory they have gained. Towards Howard his manner was more than usually affectionate, as if he strove to repair the great wrong his tender conscience caused him to feel he had inflicted' upon him by his momentarily envious feelings. Howard on his part was devoted to Duncan, and endeavored in every way he could devise to lessen the trial of his sickness. Delia was much impressed with the contrast be- tween Duncan's sickness and its effect upon the other members of the family, and that of her Cousin Fred, the preceding summer. Here sickness was met and borne as coming from the hand of a loving Father, and the whole household seemed to be sharers in the quiet cheerfulness of the patient, who after his -one great season of depression bore so bravely his cross of suffering. None of the family said much about Duncan's ill- ness, for his father and mother deemed it injudicious, on the one hand, to be reminding him constantly of 29*   342      STEP BY STEP"--OR, it; or, on the other, to appear indifferent to his com- forts or condition; so while he felt that he was an object of affectionate interest to the whole household, he was not made a constant object of compassion. To the parents no less than to the son, this sickness was a sore trial, and viewed from the imperfect light of human knowledge, a mysterious dispensation also; but they never failed to regard it with the eye of faith, which " can alone interpret life." Thus they rested securely on the "Rock of Ages" with that perfect rest which only sorrow-tried and believing souls can feel. One more conversation Duncan had with his mother in regard to the great change that had taken place in his prospects. After that, it was many months before he again alluded to his feelings upon the subject, judging, with a discretion beyond his years, it was the better way to dwell as little as pos- sible upon so painful a theme. It was a mild morn- ing in the month of January he came to his mother as she sat busily at work and said: "It is only right, mamma, since I have told you my naughty feelings, to tell you my good ones also, is it?" "I am always glad to hear everything'you wish to say to me, my dear." "Yes, I know it, mamma, and I am always so glad to tell you everything, you can't tell how glad. But I wanted to say that I think I have conquered those -evil feelings I told you of before, and that I think I am now really reconciled to my condition, as I thought I was the day I first spoke to you on the subject. That was the natural effervesence of an excited state of mind, I suppose. I thought it was   DELIA ARLINGTON.      343 an easy thing then to be brave and enduring, but I did not know. This I feel is the result of reflection and prayer. I think I may not be useless even in my present state of health. I suppose it must be the very discipline I need. It is a great comfort to me, mamma, to know that 'whom the Lord loveth he chas- teneth.' If I have this love, why should I repine or look upon any trial a hardship?" ("True, my dear boy, and I trust you shall know by experience, that though 'no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous; neverthe- less, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of right- eousness to them which are exercised thereby.'"   344     STEP BY STEPs--OR,- CHAPTER VIII.

Only think, he told me the other day, he wished there wasn't any such day as Sunday in the week; he hated the very name of it. "'I know the reason, Gilbert; and I don't much wonder he feels so either, after what he told me. He says he has to Keep so still and quiet all day Sunday, that when it comes night, he's so tired, he doesn't know what to do with himself. He isn't allowed to go out into the garden to walk round nor anything. Then his father and mother are so sober; he doesn't dare to speak to them hardly; and every Sunday night, after supper, he has to listen to a sermon, which his father reads aloud, and he says he doesn't understand a word of it. He thinks if he could play, and read story-books, and slide, as Freddie Wentworth does, he would like Sunday first rate." "Well, I shouldn't like to do what Freddie Went- worth does Sunday, any more than I should what Georgie Ray does, should you, Eddie?" "No, I guess I shouldn't. I like our Sunday, Gil- bert; I think it is the best day in the week, because we are with papa and mamma so much more then   DELIA ARLINGTON.      345 than any other day; and then they explain to us every- thing we don't understand in our Bible lessons, and then we have such nice walks in the garden. I love them dearly." "Yes, and then I like so much to have papa read to us after supper." "Shan't you be glad, Gilbert, when we are old enough to sit up and hear them talk in the evening. Harry says he likes it, and you know he never can keep still if there isn't something pleasant going on." "Oh, yes; mamma says perhaps we can sit up part of the evening next year; won't that be nice?" "Don't you think, Gilbert, Georgie Ray says he does't-want to go to heaven, if it's like Sunday there; but I guess he wouldn't say so, if he had such Sun- days as we have; do you think he would?" "No, I don't think he would; but perhaps he wouldn't like- what we do, after all. You know he doesn't like to get his arithmetic lessons at school, as we do." '. Perhaps he wouldn't. But I don't think he would like Freddie Wentworth's Sundays either, for all he says he should. Freddie says he gets dreadfully tired playing so much Sunday; he says- he should like a good deal better to -go to church Sunday afternoons as we do and Georgie Ray does; but his mother says, that it's an old-fashioned pejudiss, or something like that, and folks can be just as good at home or in the woods as at church." "Prejudice, you mean, I suppose," said Algernon, who at that moment joined the twins, having heard, unperceived by them, the greater part of their con- versation. "I am afraid you forget what mamma   34.6     STEP BY STEP-- OR has so often told us, that we should never talk about people. You know she says we must not judge others." "No, we didn't forget, Ally," said Eddie, the bolder of the two; "but we know she wouldn't think it right for-us to spend Sunday as Freddie does, spe- cially in the summer, when he goes birds' nesting. She says, we must be kind to every living creature." The foregoing conversation will give some idea of the views of the Christian Sabbath in which the chil- dren at Walnut Hill were brought up. When Mr. and Mrs. Leslie commenced life as another of God's families on earth, they seriously considered how they should make what was emphatically to them the Lord's day, subserve the high and sacred ends of its appointment; how they should make it not only a day of rest fromn their ordinary labors and pursuits, but also a day for that intimate communion with, and special worship of God, which the most devout Christians find to be alike a need and a privilege. As their children grew around them, it became one of their first endeavors to make the Sabbath to them a day, whose return should be hailed with reverent joy and not with dread. Regarding their children, as all Christian parents must, as immortal beings com- mitted for a season to their care, and for whose proper religious instruction they were responsible to the Infi- nite Giver of all, they felt that the duty thus imposed upon them, and which they most gratefully assumed, although with fear and trembling, was the highest and holiest which imperfect human beings could un- dertake, requiring all the wisdom and prudence and judgment they could give to it. Mr. Leslie, remembering the dreaded Sabbaths of   DELIA ARLINGTON.      347 his early years, the wearisome restraints which its re- turn put upon all the lively emotions of his young, ardent nature, the long distasteful tasks he was obliged to learn, as its tardy hours dragged along, distasteful because unsuited to his age and capacity, was determined, if possible, to avoid the like error in bringing, up his own children. What impressions were made upon Delia by the manner of spending the Sabbath -at her aunt's may be in part gathered from the following extract of a letter to her Uncle Edward. After speaking of her keen enjoyment of her present life, and alluding to Duncan's increased ill health and the Christian resig- nation with which he bore his sufferings, she went on to say: 1"You know, uncle, when you were here, you no- ticed and spoke of the bright, happy faces of my cou- sins on the Sabbath; you said you never knew the day to pass so pleasantly anywhere else. I am sure you would continue to think so, were you to look in upon us on any return of that sacred day. I really believe that even Fairy Em rejoices when Sunday comes. "All of us excepting Aunt Mary and Em, and at present Duncan, go to the Sunday School in the morning. After church in the afternoon, we all walk together in uncle's -grounds, which are quite exten- sive. No matter how cold it is, we look forward with delight to this walk, and never fail of taking it ex- cepting when it is stormy, or the snow is lying too deep on the ground. This, and going to and from church, (over half a mile,) Uncle William thinks will do very well for exercise, and is sufficient to keep off Sunday headaches.   348      STEP BY STEP,---OR, "One of the pleasantest of our home employments of Sunday was omitted during your visit. You re. collect, then, there were Scripture readings after tea, in which all the family united,uncle explaining what- ever he thought the younger children did not under- stand. In addition to that, after the three younger children have retired, uncle or aunt, or one of the older children selects some verse or some larger por- tion of the evening's reading to talk about; some- times instead of this, they make one of the sermons of the day the subject. You have no idea how pleas- ant and profitable these talks are to us. All join in them. You would be amused sometimes to see how Harry's black eyes sparkle, when some idea occurs to him which he eagerly seizes the first opportunity to express. The subject of our last Sunday evening's conversation was the text, ' That every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.' By what. was said, I gsot1 some new ideas as to what idle words are. "We seldom have any other company those even- ings than intimate friends, and they either come in too late to interrupt our conversation, or else suffi- ciently early to take part in it. Aside from the good religious instruction we get in this way, I think it has other good effects; it teaches us to think and talk. Now when I read anything, I am much more likely than I used to be to consider what particular bearing it may have upon any subject we have' discussed, or how it may illustrate some other subject; and also I find I can express my opinions more easily and in better language than I could once, in consequence, I think, of this practice. Besides this, however, we have one evening in the week called conversation   DELIA ARLINGTON.      349 evening, which is at the same time amusing, interest- ing and improving. - Oh, uncle, how I want to tell you so many things which I find it quite impossible to do in writing." As the conversation to which Delia alluded in her letter to her uncle will serve to' illustrate the plan upon which they were usually conducted, it is given below. The twelfth chapter of Matthew had been read for the evening lesson, and commented upon in a general way. Algernon then selected the text: "But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment," for discussion. "As the text is your selection, Master Algernon," said Mr. Leslie, ' we will first hear your interpreta- tion of it." "Its meaning is very plain to me, father," said the straight-forward little puritan, "so plain that I should not have selected it for our evening's talk, bad it not been for something Howard said the other day about idle words. I think every useless, foolish, jesting word, as well as wicked words, are idle words." "How do you define useless words, my son?" "I think all fine figures of rhetoric, and all words used as mere ornaments of style in writing or speak- ing, are useless words." "And foolish words?" "-I think foolish and jesting words might be classed together, and I mean by them vain and frivolous con- versation, idle jokes, and silly puns, and everything of that sort." "I suppose we all agree as to what wicked words are, so we will not take up time in discussing that 80   350      STEP BY STEP,---OR, division of the subject. Does any one differ from Algernon?" "I do, father, I'm sure," said Harry, " for I don't believe it's a bit wicked to use all the pretty words we can think of, when we are telling about anything we like, and I don't see how it can be wrong to joke and have a little fun once in a while. I'm sure if all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, all prose and no poetry would make him a cross one. I heard How say so the other day, and I think just as How does."            . "As far as you understand what How thinks, you mean, I suppose," said Mr. Leslie, smiling at Harry's earnestness. "What is your opinion of the passage, Delia?" At this moment Melville Temple entered. -He fre- quently spent his Sunday evenings with the Leslies, so after he had exchanged greetings with the family, Mr. Leslie informed him what the subject of the even- ing's conversation was, and requested him to join them; then turning to Delia, again repeated his question. "I should not interpret it as Algernon does, Uncle William," she replied with some hesitation, for under the sharp, penetrating glance of Melville Temple, she was never quite unembarrassed. "What he considers idle words seem to me often add very much, not only to the beauty but also to the effectiveness either of speech or writing. I suppose our most eloquent ser- mons and most touching poetry owe their power in a great measure to the very words that Ally calls use. less. Surely they cannot be so, if they are made the instruments of giving more power and directness to thought."  /:   DELIA ARLINGTON.      351 is You like, then, what is denominated fine writing, I suppose, Miss Delia," said Melville, with the slight- est possible tone of contempt in his speech. "Yes, Mr. Temple, what I call fine writing." Such as exhausting all the adjectives and super- latives in the English language to adorn a thought, which would be far more effective expressed in the simplest terms?" "Such as Milton did not deem it unworthy his immortal genius to make use off and which has adorned his beautiful description of Paradise; such too as our own Bryant has not scorned in that most dignified of his poems, the Thanatepsis," replied Delia, with some spirit, for she felt a little indignant at Melville's manners towards her. "That's right, Delia," said Howard, who this time forebore to come to her assistance, seeing she was quite equal to standing her ground, as he expressed it. "That's right, I like that." "A very proper rebuke to me, Miss Delia, I ac- knowledge," Melville frankly replied. "I ask your pardon for classing you with those sentimental young ladies, who adore flowery sermons and weak dilu- tions of commonplace, dressed out in garlands and wreaths.   I will tell you what I call idle, words," said he, turning abruptly to Mr. Leslie. "We are all attention, Melville." "I call those idle words, which, under a specious and apparently fair use of language, pervert the most sacred truths of the gospel into myths and fables, and which tend to weaken our faith in everything except- ing our own supreme excellence. I call those idle wfords, which are made to prove that the sermons we   352      STEP BY STEP,- OR, find in trees and stones and running-brooks, and sunny hills and flowery verdant vales are best fitted to the wants of the human soul; best adapted to give it strength for that mighty warfare with sin, in which it must engage, and prepare it for death and judg- ment; from such idle words I ran away to-night, thinking, curiously enough, as I came up the avenue, of the very text I found you considering. Hence," turning to Delia, " my rudeness to you." Mr. and Mrs. Leslie knew very well that Melville referred to his friends the Wentworths, whose manner of spending the Sabbath was alluded to by the twins at the commencement of this chapter; and -who, al- though excellent, kindly disposed and benevolent people, practising the very virtues enjoined by the Saviour, yet gave to him and his mission a rank so low as greatly to grieve the hearts of their friends, who regarded Him and Him only, " as the Way, and the Truth, and the Life," "the only name under heaven given among men whereby we may be saved." "I presume," replied Mr. Leslie, " that you do not -wish to be understood as entertaining the opiniorn, that there is no good to be derived from intimate communion with God in his works. I think some of the holiest, as well as purest feelings of our nature are not only awakened, but are also strengthened by such communion." "Certainly, sir, I perfectly agree with you. What I wished to say was, that nature is not of itself suffi- cient for the soul in its conflicts and trials. There are wants of man, which it never does and never can reach and satisfy. There are certain articles of food, which answer a very good purpose in connection with more substantial nutriment, but which are in-   DELIA ARLINGTON.       353 sufficient alone to support life. Those, who thus wilfully substitute husks for the true bread of life, might with reason say with Shakespeare,-- if I may be allowed to encroach on the province of Howard,- , When we in our viciousness grow-hard, (0 misery on't!) the wise gods seel our eyes; In our own filth drop our clean judgments ; make us Adore our errors; laugh at us, while we strut To our confusion.'" "You are rather severe, Melville," said Mr. Leslie gravely, who never liked any exhibition of excited feeling, particularly in the presence of his children. "What have you to say, my boys?" turning to Howard and Duncan. "We have not yet heard from you." Howard, who saw Duncan's cheek glowing and his eye brightening, answered: "My tastes speak for me, father; no lover of Shakespeare can ever condemn as idle words, such as are used to give force and expression to a good thought, whose effect may-perhaps depend. quite as much upon the originality of its garb, as upon its own intrinsic merit. Now, Duncan, I've said my say for ( glorious Will,' let's have your thought?" "My-views are not altogether my own, but I will venture to give them, notwithstanding. Papa told me the other day, what I fancied to be the case, that idle words in the original mean evil, malicious words. I think, therefore, if we never use any words with an evil feeling or with an evil purpose in our hearts, we may safely, at proper times and seasons, use all the variety our language affords to add beauty to our thoughts, force to our conception, grace to our style, and mirth to our hours of relaxation. The great and 80   354      STEP BY STEP,--OR, good Father, who made this beautiful world, with all its variety of mountain and valley, ocean and desert, river and plain, wood and meadow, with its beautiful carpet of living green, diversified by its countless number of brilliant flowers, 'stars of the earth,9 its gorgeous clouds by day, and its rich spangled curtain by night, never intended to call us to account for using gems of speech, flowers of rhetoric, to. embelish our ideas. The East is the birth-place of poetry and the nurse of metaphorical writing, and our Saviour was constantly in the habit of using figurative lan" guage, to enforce and illustrate his teachings and doctrines. Where he led the way we may surely follow." Here Duncan stopped exhausted, and there was a pause, for all were impressed by his reverent enthu- siasm. Algernon, however, seemed to be rallying his forces in the meantime for a defence of his own views, when the silence was broken by Mrs. Norton, who abruptly said: "My opinion is, that pretty much all. the words we use are idle words, if idle means evil or malicious. How can it be otherwise, since our words proceed from our hearts, which are, as we all know,' deceitful above all things and desperately wicked!' And didn't our Saviour say,' Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts?' I don't pretend to be wiser than the Scriptures; I've had some experience myself, and that confirms what the Scriptures say. I believe in the truth of the old proverb, 'least said soonest mended.' " "But when you quote Scripture, sister," said Mr. Leslie, " you should be careful not to look too much on one side of the question which may be under t       :'   DELI-A ARLINGTON   .    355 consideration. You should compare one text with another, and draw your conclusions carefully. Now, according to the verse following that we have been discussing, good words may be spoken as well as bad; for that reads, '.By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.' However, the conclusion of the whole matter, as I look at it, is this, if we are governed by the Gospel of Christ, if his spirit is in our hearts, no idle words will proceed from our lips, whether our speech, taking its character from our respective temperaments, be grave or gay, sad or cheerful, poetical or prosaic, and unless we have his spirit abiding within us, there is danger that our most common words may all be included in the condemnation of the text, in that great day of reckoning, which awaits us all. But it is late, my children. Melville, will you join our devotions? 2 After a hymn of praise and thanksgiving had been sung, the earnest, sincere prayer that followed, which dwelt upon the subject of the evening's conversation, aand earnestly entreated that the hearts of all might be kept pure, so that whatever proceeded therefrom might be pure also, impressed each one by its direct simplicity; and even Aunt Charlotte's austere counte. nance wore a softer expression, when she bade them all good night, and retired to her own room. \           x ,               .   50S00     STEP BY STEP-- OR, CHAPTER IX. "I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart." SHAKSPEARE. "WISH you would tell me, Cousin Delia," said Howard, one evening as they two sat a little apart from the group at. the table, " how you feel when Melville Temple takes one of his surveys of you, or, as we boys say, takes you up when you're talking." "What a question, Howard; how do you know I have any particular feeling about it?" "By your looks, cousin mine. Your face, my thane (for thane readDelia), is as a book where men May read strange matters.'" "By what right do you study my face so closely?" asked Delia smiling. "'Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;' or if it pleases you better,' What an eye she hath! Methinks it sounds a parley of provocation.'  "Oh, you incorrigible Shakespearian! One need have 'good courage surely to sound 'a parley of provo- cation' with you. It is really quite a misfortune to have such a tell-tale phiz. One day you call me stately and queenly; another, dull and melancholy; another, prosaic; another, almost cross; and not con- tent with what you see so distinctly, you now even dare to pry into the secret of my thoughts. Well, if I must tell you, I must, When Melville Temple looks at me with those eyes of his, which seem to penetrate into my very soul, I feel just as if he was "                        J   DELIA ARLINGTON.      357  saying to himself, you are 'weighed in the balance and found wanting,'-and when he essays to talk ' with me, which, by the way, he very seldom does, as if he was taking my intellectual and moral guage." "And sometimes he finds a deeper guage than he looks for, as for instance, the other night, when he so almost sarcastically assailed you upon fine writing. It really tickles me to see how he mistakes you for a flighty school-girl, and how you fancy him almost an ogre; confess now, and make a clean breast of it. Don't you almost fear sometimes he'll devour you?" "Not bodily; but I do fear almost at times, lest I should dwindle down in intellect into the pigmy stature which he seems to assign to me, especially if I should be thrown much into his society." "Melville is a right down good fellow, Delia; but the fact is, he understands you just as well as you understand him, and it's all because you were so grand and lofty at first." "Yes, I know you say that, but it is not so now, Howard. I've tried to overcome those offensive man- ners of which you accuse me. There is one comfort, at all events, it is not a matter of the greatest conse- quence what Melville Temple thinks of me." "Now that's not like your usual candid self, Delia. It is hardly possible but that you consider it of some consequence what the son and brother of two of your dearest friends think of you." "True, Howard, you are right. I was pettish when I said it was not, but I don't regard it a matter of sufficient importance to be unhappy about; do  / you?" "No, certainly not, only it seems to, me you ought not to be so indifferent about it, as to make no effort   358      STEP BY STEP,--OR, to change the opinion Melville has seen fit to form of you. You always seem to be on stilts when he's present. Act yourself, and you will soon come to understand each other better. You know mother says its best to cultivate the good will of every one; it is no more than Christian to do it." "Without regard to age or sex?" s Certainly; within such limitations as mokdesty re- quires; and what they are, every delicate and right minded person, she says, can easily decide. But, sister Delia, it appears to me you have not fulfilled your part of the compact we entered into some time ago. I am always reproving you and picking all sorts of flaws in your character, while you never so much as say, 'Pshaw, Howard,' at any thing I do or say; it's because I'm so perfect, I've no doubt; no faults have I, never a bit. But soberly, Delia, it makes me feel a little cheap to have you take all my reproofs so very humbly and lamb-like, and never so much as retort or return the compliment." "But you do not need reproof as I do, Howard, and I say it not altogether in humility either. With- -out a mother, and such a mother, you might have had as many faults as I. As it is, you would have no excuse were you what might be called a faulty young man. But I meant to fulfil my part of the compact; the trouble has been, that whenever I have seen anything which I thought deserving of censure in you, you have always corrected yourself before I found an opportunity to administer my sage coun- sel." "For instance?" "For instance, when Duncan first became so much of an invalid, I saw how your loud cheerfulness # or      .   DELIA ARLINGTON,       359 pained his delicate nerves, and sensitive nature, but before I found the fit time to say anything to you about it, your manner changed." "Is that all? Is there nothing else- that I do, which you think wrong, or which you would like to see different?" "Well, I doubt if it is quite right to make even good-natured fun of Aunt Charlotte; it is scarcely respectful, to say the least, considering her age and who she is. Indeed, I doubt, if we should ever make even good-natured fun of any one." "I know it's not right, Delia, but then not to do it, the temptation is so great, is the hardest thing I ever undertook yet. She is so solemn, so unhappy, and comes out with such queer speeches, and sometimes so seems to rejoice when her forebodings of evil come to pass, that it makes me have all sorts of wicked& thoughts, and once in awhile, out they will come in spite of all I can do. How do you suppose she'd ever bear real trouble?"      - "I don't know. Your mother says she would bear it nobly, as she has done before, -but I can't under- stand it." "Well, as this is the first and only piece of sisterly counsel you've ever given me, Delia, I'll do my best to act upon it, and henceforth I will endeavor to treat Aunt Charlotte with a reverence which shall com. mand the admiration of my most respectful cousin, sister, fair monitress. I mean the Hon. Miss Arling- ton." "Be careful that you don't over-do the matter. Aunt Charlotte's wit, in its way, is as keen as yours." "Yes, in the cloudy line, she's the keenest vision I   360     STEP BY STEP,-- OR, ever knew for spying out all the motes between earth and heaven. Seriously, Delia, I do respect Aunt Charlotte and love her too, for I know she has really one of the kindest hearts in the world. She couldn't have the same blood in her viens as my father, if she hadn't. I'll tell you how I found out she had a heart; for she had been several years an inmate of our house before I regarded her in any other light than an anomaly in creation. Two years ago I had a typhus fever, which reduced me very low. After my reason returned, I was so very weak, I doubt if any one knew for some days, that I was conscious of every- thing about me. Aunt Charlotte persisted, in spite of all opposition, in staying with me at meal times, and then how she used to cry over me, and mourn for me in her characteristic fashion. I declare to you, Delia, some of her lamentations seemed so irresistibly ludi- crous, that, weak as I was, I could scarcely refrain from laughing. She has changed very much in her views of things, as, indeed, how could it be other- wise, living with my father and mother?" "True enough, Howard, how could it? The few months I have been here, have wrought a great change in my feelings and opinions upon many sub- jects, and have had a most salutary'effect, as it seems to me, on my character. "I wonder," she added, rather abruptly, " what I shall do when I really shall come into possession of my property, whether I shall make a wise or a foolish use of it? After all, it must be a great responsibility to have wealth." "At last," said Howard laughing, " you have spoken aos if you really were an heiress,- the first time since you have been here,--I have wondered how you always took it so coolly."   DELIA ARLINGTON,      361 ' In the first place, Howard, I seldom do realize that I am an heiress, and when from any circum- stance I do, I endeavor to dismiss the subject from my mind as soon as possible. It is no merit of mine, surely." "Most surely not; still there are a very few per- sons, indeed, on this earth of ours, above being some- what inflated at the prospect of great wealth." "I suppose one reason why I am not, is, that my father never seemed to attach much importance to his wealth ; and like you, Howard, I am influenced by early associations." "And you cannot tell, Delia, how grateful I am that my early associations, and the influences which have had the forming of my character, have been so good. Duncan, I do not doubt, would have been pure and upright under almost any circumstances; he, it seems to me, was born so, and has grown up so; but I,-I am so impulsive, so easily influenced by those I love,--I tremble to think what I might have been, had I not been brought up in a religious home, and by the best of fathers and mothers." "You have cause to be grateful, Howard, truly. I think my cousin, Fred Grafton, was not unlike you in natural disposition; but how unlike you in the manner of his life, - in his aims and feelings." "Poor fellow, he must have been unhappy. Noth- ing makes me so wretched, Delia, as to feel that I have done wrong. How he must have suffered in the latter part of his career." "Yes, he suffered intensely,-how intensely, no one but himself and his Heavenly Father knew; his countenance indicated that.- But I do not think he suffered, as you would, under the same circumstances, 31   362      STEP BY STEP,--OR, with the exception of your religious training; for his conscience had never been educated as yours has been. I have noticed how your mother always appeals to the consciences of the younger children in correcting their faults; thus leading them to decide, themselves, the right and the wrong of their actions. I suppose it must have been the same with you." "Yes, it was; but I never thought before of the difference between an educated and an uneducated conscience.", "I suppose you have never thought how different, in many particulars, the circumstances of your life have been, from those of not a few others, but it is very evident to me. Oh, Howard, how different might I have been, had I had a mother or some female friend, in my own station, to care for me. And how unlike everything is here, from what it was at my Aunt Grafton's, - as unlike as if the two fam- ilies belonged to different orders of beings. I am so happy here, Howard; I feel every day as if there was a purpose in life, - as if every hour's, nay, every second's employment, whatever it may be, was all tending towards one great end." There was a short pause, which presently Delia broke by saying, 1' Howard, how do you think I shall succeed in talking your mother's place this winter, in visiting her poor and sick?" "Very well, on the whole, but you'll find some pretty tough customers; there's Mrs. Robbins, the mother of those boys, the twins are so much inter- ested in, and old Mr. Holton; I don't know how you'll manage with them." "Well, I'll do my best. Aunt Mary says she finds it difficult, and indeed scarcely prudent for her to go   DELIA ARLINGTON.      363 out much this cold weather, and she thinks it will be a good thing for me to make these visits. I am to go every week, as she has done, and when she's able she'll go with me." "You'll fin;d some of your calls delightful. Susy Lee and old Father West are always cheerful and happy, mother says; and I like sunshine above all things."            -   364      STEP BY STEP,--OR, CHAPTER     X. s"Nor did we fail to see within ourselves What need there is to be reserved in speech, And temper all our thoughts with charity." WORDSWORTH. SMOOTHLY and peacefully, as the current of Delia's life flowed on in the congenial society, and kind companionship of her aunt and cousins, it must not be supposed, that her haughty spirit and quick tem- per were entirely subdued, or found no exciting causes to arouse them. Howard was so genuine in his kind heartedness, that she never took offence at his playful sallies, levelled, as they frequently were, at her weaknesses. But she often found herself tempted tol give back a hasty answer - to Mrs. Norton, whose perpetual harping upon disagreeable and gloomy subjects, was very annoying to her; and, as it has already been seen, she was sometimes a good deal irri- tated by Melville Temple's manner towards her. But she had another fault, which Mr. Leslie in his fatherly watchfulness of her, had early observed, and was only waiting a favorable moment to point out to her, and caution her to be on her guard against it. Like most young persons of superior talents, and no inconsiderable force of character, she was very posi- tive in her likings and antipathies, and very much inclined to think those who did not come up to her standard of right, or her idea of moral and intellectual worth, undeserving of much esteem, or any great regard, and was very averse from forming intimacies   DELIA ARLINGTON.      365 with such, or even cultivating their acquaintance. As it often happens, Mrs. Leslie's immediate neighbors were not persons with whose religious views she her- self could sympathize, and from whom she also differed widely upon the subjects of education, family discipline, and almost everything relating to the young. These were the Wentworths and the Rays, some of the peculiar notions of both of whomr have already been adverted to. .But they were kind, con- scientious, practical Christians, according to their respective ideas; and upon the broad platform of a common humanity, however unlike their creeds might be, Mr. and Mrs. Leslie felt that they could meet socially, and even sympathize together in many partic- ulars, although in matters considered to be of vital interest to each, they were as wide asunder as the poles. Consequently they were on terms of consid- erable intimacy with both families. Indeed they regarded neighborly kindness and intercourse a pos- itive Christian duty, and were not afraid to expose their children to the influence of persons differing so widely in opinion and sentiment from themselves, at least under their own eye, so great was their confi- dence in their own methods of education. Delia was not a little surprised at her uncle and aunt's notions upon this matter, and was not at all disposed to adopt them. She had not yet, in fact, at- tained the grace of true Christian humility, which, while it renders one as firm as a rock in his own convictions, does not disqualify him from allowing the same privilege to others, or from acknowledging that there may be important truths which have never yet been apprehended by his own mind. Entertain- ing such feelings as she did, it was not without vex- 81*   366      STEP BY STEP,--OR,  ation that she heard Mr. Leslie propose one evening, that the Rays and Wenitworths be invited to join them in their weekly conversations; and immediately exclaimed: "Oh, uncle!"    , With a kind smile, he turned towards her and said: "I am ready to hear any objections that may be stated; and after that, you must listen to me, and then we will take the sense of the company upon the proposition. Delia, I will commence with you; please to interpret that ' Oh, uncle!" Delia blushed, and said with some hesitation: "I thought it would spoil all our pleasure, and" "And what, my dear." "I don't think I shall ever want to speak before Mrs. Ray or Mrs. Wentworth either." "Perhaps not, at first; but your diffidence -would soon wear off. Is that all?" "Why, no, sir, not quite all; I don't see how it can add to our improvement, to have persons join us , whose views are so unlike our own, and, if I may be allowed to say it, so very mistaken." "Is discussion, where all are on one side, likely to be the most improving, then, in your opinion?" asked Mr. Leslie, with a slight tone of satire in his speech. 1"Oh, no, sir, I didn't mean that; but somehow it seems to me, that there are some persons whose ideas are so very unreasonable, that there is little profit in listening to them, while it may be something of a trial for the patience." "I am astonished at you, Delia," broke in Howard,   DELIA ARLINGTON.      367 "to be so insensible to all the advantages you might / derive from the conversation of Mrs. Wentworth.  Why, a few years ago, she held weekly conversaziones  in Boston, which were attended by some of our/ brightest literary stars; then she is a poetess, an accomplished linguist, very learned in all the ologies, and when the transcendental fever raged in these parts, a year or two ago, she was a constant contri- butor to a publication called the Dial. I have seen some of her articles, and I do assure you, they defy all my powers of comprehension. I should say, in the language of the incomparable Will, ( Her reasons are as two grains of wheat, hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have found them, they are not worth the search.'" "That will do Howard, " said his father. "Now we will hear from some one else. What say you, sister?" "I, - why you know, brother, I think all this con- versation talk, nonsense. Didn't we get along well enough without it in our younger days? I don't see why we can't talk when there's any kind of need of it, without having meetings expressly for the purpose. I know I can say all I want to, Without such meet- ings. It always does seem to me, that in this vale of tears, we better be spending our time to more profit, than learning to speak glib. I reckon elegant conver- sation don't show  the way to heaven. But if you must have such notional matters, why, pray let us have the Rays in; as for the Wentworths, it strikes me you must have some patience, if you can listen to that woman. Why, I never heard her speak about what I call religion, in my life."   368      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, "Our conversations are not intended to be strictly religious, sister, as the word is usually understood; but simply social talks upon such subjects of interest as any one may propose." ' That's the very thing; if they were upon relig- ious subjects, there might be some sense in them; but as it is, I don't see much. If you must have them, I hope you'll invite Mrs. Ray.. I call her a rational woman, for she seems to have a realizing sense of the transitory nature of earthly things. She's a truly godly woman, and I'm sure there's need enough of such, everywhere, in these sinful times." "Well, -Duncan, what do you say?" asked his  father, turning to him. ( Oh, I should like to have the circle enlarged; I think it would give more variety to the conversation, and make it more improving as well as entertaining. I like Mrs. Wentworth, and am always interested to hear her talk; she is so easy and fluent, and so poetical." "You don't care how shallow the Stream is then," said Howard, " provided it leaps and sparkles, and plays in the sunshine. For my part, I think with Pope,- I'm sorry Shakespeare didn't say it:- ' A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.' " "I don't think the stream is shallow," said Duncan earnestly. "You are so practical, Howard, you think at once, if a lady writes poetry she must be shallow and superficial. I am but a boy, it is true, but Mrs. Wentworth has given me a great many new and beautiful ideas." "Right, my son," said Mr. Leslie," and those who are, older and wiser than you, too. I am very sorry to differ from two such experienced judges as Delia   DELIA ARLINGTON.      369 and Howard; but I must confess, that I entertain a high opinion of Mrs. Wentworth's talents and abilities, and I wish that all the would-be poets and poetesses of the present day had half her originality and power of expression." "But, uncle," said Delia, timidly, a' don't you think she's very pedantic. She talks about writing poetry, and having it published, just as if it was an every-day matter. If I possessed such a gift, I don't think I should be so free to speak of it." "Because you are naturally more reserved than she is. Is it wise to make yourself a standard of judg- ment, or to condemn another for doing what you might not be willing to do, or even might shrink from? Pray, my staid little critic, did you ever see two flowers or two faces just alike?" "No, sir." "Why then expect any two minds to work in the same manner?" "Because," said Melville, who had hitherto been a listener to the conversation, " you never saw a very young lady yet, who could ever see any virtue or any worth in anybody a little different from her model. The world would be all a clover bed if they had their way, and nothing else should grow." "I am much obliged to you, Mr. Temple," said Delia, with evidently forced calmness, " better have the world 'a clover bed than a bed of thistles; for while the former is excellent food for dumb animals, the latter is a noxious weed, and serves n9 other pur- pose than to prick."- "( That's right, Delia," said Howard, in great glee; ic never say die. ' Shall quips, and sentences, and these paper bullets of the brain, awe a man from the career of his humor? '"   370      STEP BY STEP,--OR  Mr. Leslie, who saw Delia's flushed face, and no- ticed the slight tremor in her voice, hastened to direct attention from her and give her time to recover, by calling on Algernon for his opinion. This grave little gentleman expressed himself in a most decided manner to the effect, that he entertained about the same views upon the subject that Aunt Charlotte did. He thought they might derive a good deal of benefit from the conversation of so serious- minded a woman as Mrs. Ray, and added: "Mrs. Wentworth's conversation may be very amusing, but it doesn't seem to me to be scarcely anything more; and I don't believe such conversa- tion can be very profitable." Well, what then, Master Algernon Sidney Les- lie?" said Howard. "' Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?' Are we not to have a little fun out of our evening's talk? Must it be all improvement?" "There is not likely to be any lack of fun where you are, Howard," said Duncan, laughing. "Order, now, my children," said Mr. Leslie. "I believe we have heard all the pros and cons. I would merely add to what has been said, that as improve- ment and pleasure both are the objects of these fireside gatherings, you must give your decision ac- cordingly, and if you exclude one of our neighbors, you must exclude both. 3But," he added in a graver tone, " let me warn you against judging others by your own ideals or standards of excellence or pro- priety, as though there could be no appeal from them. Remember always, that there has never been but one perfect being on this earth, and he said, 'Judge not lest ye be judged, for with what judgment ye judge j   'DELIA ARLINGTON.      371 ye shall be judged'; and also, ' Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.' Now I will listen to any dissenting voice to the prop- osition of inviting our neighbors to join us in our weekly conversations. I hear none. Well now, if our invitation is accepted, let it not be an object of our meetings to criticize each other, but to obtain whatever good or pleasure they may be capable of affording."      0 "Yes, sir," said Howard, with a ludicrous air of mock humility, I take all that on my shoulders." "( I am glad you are ready to do so, Howard," said his mother, who thus far had taken no part in the conversation, " for it has occurred to me several times this evening, that our household rule, not to discuss our neighbors, has been somewhat violated. I should say our good friend, Mrs. Wentworth, whom I highly esteem, much as I differ from her on many subjects, has been rather freely criticized here to-night." "Oh,'mother dear, there are exceptions to the best of rules, and in this case I think I can prove my father has set us the example in what I consider a parallel case." "How is that, my boy?" asked Mr. Leslie. "Why, father, you know when there are candidates for public office, you always freely discuss their merits and demerits, and why should not we do the same on a smaller scale? Of course, we could not decide upon so momentous a question as the one under considera- tion, without some talk as to the qualifications of the persons proposed for admission to our most select and erudite circle." "Ingenious as ever, Howard," said his mother, smiling; "( but a word to the wise, you know."   372      STEP BY STEP,---OR, "Uncle," said Delia, coming towards Mr. Leslie, and speaking in a low voice, "I thank you for the hints you have given me this evening. I will try to profit by them. I hope you will not think too unfa- vorably of me for getting so vexed with Mr. Temple. "And I wish to ask your pardon, Miss Delia," said Melville, who came up unperceived by her, " for my rudeness. Perhaps you will think I am always sin- ning and always repenting. I believe I do take a naughty pleasure in showing up, as Howard calls it, little feminine weaknesses, but this shall be the last fault of the kind with you positively, for I find you are not made of the metal most young ladies are." "My pardon is most readily granted, Mr. Temple, but in doing so I must ask you to be less severe in future upon all very young ladies as well as myself; perhaps you might learn to think better of them as a class, were you not so much upon the watch to dis- cover their weaknesses." "You lay upon me a hard condition, Miss Delia, but I'll try, that's as much as the best of us can do." "My dear Delia," said Mr. Leslie, in one of his kindest tones, as Melville joined Howard the other side of the room, " be always as ready to acknowledge your own errors, and to govern your hasty feelings as you have been to-night. Two thirds of the unhappi- ness and trouble in families and in society arise, in my opinion, from the fact, that almost every one thinks himself pretty near perfection, and is unwilling to tolerate what does not square exactly with his ideas and notions. We are all too much like the Irish servant: ' Faix an' shure,' whatever goes wrong, 'it's mesel that's right, an' has the raison for't.' "   DELIA ARLINGTON.       373 CHAPTER XI. "Oh, thou invisible spirit of wine, If thou hast no name to be known by, let Us call thee devil.     SHAKESPEARE. ONE afternoon, as Delia was preparing to go out to make the visits referred to in the preceding chap- ter, Doctor Morton, Mr. Leslie's family physician, drove hastily up to the door, and entering, desired to see Mrs. Leslie without delay. "Good afternoon, Mrs. Leslie. I have come to ask your interest in behalf of a most unfortunate patient of mine. Mrs. Robbins fell upon the ice yesterday, and broke her leg; it has been set, and she may do well if she can be kept from drink. I have engaged Jane Turner to take care of her, but she's miserably destitute of the commonest comforts of life. My wife is sick abed, and my own time is wholly occupied with my professional visits, se I don't see what I can do but make Mrs. Robbins over to you." "I will endeavor to see that she is cared for, Doctorj and will send to her directly, if you will tell me what is most needed." "Everything is needed but liquor. You know she's been in the habit of spending every copper she could earn for that. This accident may be a blessed thing for her. She's on her back now, and will be obliged to stay there for a good many weeks, and Jane Tur- ner is not one to be bribed, or to mind her fretting or teasing."                 % And kind Doctor Morton hurried off with a Heart 82     374     STEP BY STEP,-- OR,  quite at ease respecting the unfortunate woman, now that Mrs. Leshe was interested in her. When Delia came to her aunt for instructions pre- vious to setting out on her errand of mercy, she found Susan, the nurse, ready to go with her. Mrs. Leslie informed her in a few words of Mrs. Robbins's state, and gave her the necessary directions, when the two hurried off, well loaded with baskets and bundles. As they approached the miserable dwelling in which Mrs. Robbins lived, Delia instinctively shrunk from entering. Just then to add to her dread, Susan said: "If there's a place I particularly dislike to go to, it is this woman's house. I would rather do anything than be sent there. She's the crossest, and most un- grateful creature I ever saw in my life. But your aunt doesn't mind that, Miss, but tells me of the day when she was a sweet young thing, pretty and genteel for her station." At that moment the door was opened by Jane Turner, who had been watching for them, and who invited them into the kitchen; from the appearance of which, it was very apparent what the character of the mistress was. On the shelves were ranged. a few articles of broken crockery, discolored and battered tins, &c.; in one corner lay a heap of nondescript ar- ticles, which had evidently been a long time accumu- lating, and in different parts of the room there were, a stool minus one leg, a chair ditto, another without a back, a rickety table, a dirty box, and an old chest all dingy and dusty, which gave to it a most cheerless aspect,-now lighted up as much as it possibly could be by the beams of the winter's sun, as they found their way through the cracked and smoky window panes.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      375 "I have but jest come in, Miss, this morning, and  have had no time to slick up, as you see," said Jane, apologetically, as she noticed the expression of Delia's countenance, "and Mrs. Robbins has been so poorly." "Who's them, Jane?" asked a coarse rough voice from the little bed-room within the kitchen, "Miss Leslie's niece and Susan, you know, Miss Robbins. They come to see you, and to bring you a power of nice things." "Ax Miss What's-her-name to come in." Delia went into the little bed-room which presented the same forbidding appearance as the kitchen, only if possible, more forlorn. There she found the wretched woman lying upon a miserable bed, cov- ered with a dirty calico spread, her coarse face, upon which sin had placed his own terrible ,marks, now quite pale from recent suffering. "How do you do, Mrs. Robbins?" said Delia.  "Aunt Leslie sent me to you, and she wished me to  say that she would come to see you to-morrow if she is able."   "Oh, I'm 'bout as misabul as one need be, I expect. - May-be, Miss, your aunt didn't think to send me a little drop of cordial to set me up. I'm so faint and weak, it's jest what I want." "No, the doctor said you must be very careful what you eat or drink, or you'll bring on a fever. I  have brought some tea and milk. Would you like a  cup, or will you have some oatmeal gruel."  "Don't come here with your slops, and sich stuff only fit for a baby; don't you see I can't live ndhow 'thout a drop of sumthin' to keep soul and body  together," replied Mrs. Robbins, angrily. "My aunt sent what she and the doctor thought   376      STEP BY STEP-- OR, best for you, and you know you must keep very quiet, or your broken leg will not heal." This Delia said kindly, but firmly. Mrs. Robbins, bent only on the gratification of her love of drink, thought that possibly she might obtain in one way what she could not in another. So, looking at Delia with as pleasant an expression as she could assume, she said: "-You've a kind face of yer own, Miss, and a pretty one too, and I've hearn you're powerful rich yourself, now yer know doctors take notions and sich, and there's no movin' em; but I know a glass, jest one glass of brandy, may-be, would set me up like. Now jest give me the money to git it, and I'll remember it in you as long as I live; now do, do," she whined piteously. "I cannot, Mrs. Robbins, it is the very worst thing you could have. Do keep still, please do, and hear me. You know the doctor and Aunt Leslie only wish to do what will be for your good. I am sure you must be convinced of that; and you wish to get well again, do you not? Aunt told me to say to you it would be hard for you at first, but it is the only thing that will save your life." "No, I don't want to git well, nuther. I'd as lief die to-night as not, and I tell you what, by --," and she uttered an oath, which chilled the warm blood in Delia's veins. Jane, overhearing her, put her head in at the door, and said, authoritatively: "None of that talk, Miss Robbins, or I don't stay here, you may be sartin." v  A little subdued, Mrs. Robbins continued: "Why should I want to live in rags and poverty   '  ' : i .   DELIA ARLINGTON.      377  and dirt; I who was once the nicest and neatest girl :i in the village, every body said so, and went to meet- ?' ing on Sunday, and got Bible lessons, and worked for the finest ladies in the place. Why should I want to live as I do now in this here place, where nobody will give me a little drop when Pm so weak and feeble?" "Ah!" whispered Jane to Susan, " that's the very way she used to talk. She was allers so pretty spoken afore that Jim Robbins bewitched her. After she married him she soon larnt to go down hill as fast as he did. I'm thinkin' though she was driv to drink to drownd her troubles,--poor thing, poor thing! We don't know, none on us, what we shall come to, if temptation is put in our way." ("So Mrs. Leslie says, but I can't feel quite so charitable as she does any how," answered Susan. "s That's all very easy talk for the like of you, Miss," Mrs. Robbins said. "But I can never be what I was, and you know I can't, so what's the use a trying?  "But you can become a sober, respectable woman, and live neatly and bring up your pretty boys to be good men."              .  "Oh, if I only could! but yer see, Miss, I allers thought there was a spell on me and mine after I married Jim, against the will of my folks; that's the boys' father, you know. He soon took to bad ways, wuss than ever; and one night, when he'd been drinkin hard, he knocked my baby, my darlin little Elsie, in a mad fit, out of my arms, and in two weeks she was sick abed, and the Doctor said all along, it was a fall she had. Well, she died, and then I didn't care whatever come of me, and I took to, drink too, and so my boys was born, and so they've lived. They seed their father brought home, it's now two years 32*    378-     STEP BY STEP,-OR, in the delirums, and they seed him die, and they've seed me drunk almost every day since, when I could get liquor. Now is there any chance but they'll be just as bad as their father and mother was afore em?" "Every chance, Aunt Mary thinks, if you'll set them a good example. She says they are good boys; and only think, what a comfort it would be to you, to see them growing up respectable and good men." Well, well, I'll think about it. Now I'd like to see Miss Leslie, to-morrow, and hear her talk,- you talk very well for a Miss,-but she's about the only person 'sides the Doctor and the minister, who doesn't look at me as if I was lost forever. I'll take a cup of tea and be 'bleedged to you." She now turned her head away from her visitor, as though she wished to be left by herself, but as Delia was leaving the room, she said: "Come again, Miss, after yer aunt's been. I like  to look at yer." "I will, Mrs. Robbins. Good-bye." Having ascertained from Jane what was particu- larly needed for Mrs. Robbins' comfort, Delia gave the list to Susan, who returned home, while she her- self bent her steps thoughtfully to Mrs. Walter's cottage, where Susan Lee lived, who was Mrs. Wal- ter's sister. She had been to visit Susan before; so opening the outer door, she went directly to the inva- lid's room. To her light tap a gentle voice answered "come in." What a contrast to the scene she had just witnessed! Mr. and Mrs. Walter were poor peoplej and Susan's sole dependence was the kindness of the many friends, whom her patient, Christian endurance of trial had - i   DELIA ARLINGTON.   ,  379  gained for her. The furniture and arrangements of the room were simple and inexpensive, but the per- fect neatness and tasteful order of everything gave an I air of refinement to the whole. Susan lay on a bed,  the whiteness of whose sheets and pillows almost equalled that of the pure snow underneath her windows. She herself was deathly pale, 'and her  : countenance indicated constant suffering, but, at the i same time, it was radiant with peace and resignation.  One of her sister's little children sat on her bed play- ing with toys.  ( How are you to-day, Miss Susan?" "Comfortable, quite comfortable, I thank you, Miss Delia; I rested better than usual last night, and was not obliged to take the chloroform,-that always -i makes me sick."                  I "-It must be unpleasant to take it, then." "But it is such a relief to my pain. I do not mind the sickness so much. I suffered a great deal before I took it, and could not speak for a long time. Now I have so much to be grateful for, so much to make me happy, and every one is so good to me," and she  went on, in the fulness of her heart, to speak of the kind attention she was constantly receiving. "It is not only the nice things they give me, - though that is a great deal to an invalid, Miss Delia, but they are so thoughtful in sending me books that I can read, and flowers, and if they have any pretty thing they think I would like, I am always remembered,"  ' You must have many lonely hours, Miss Susan." I am alone many hours in the course of the day, yes; but then I have the kindness of my friends to think of, and the great mercy and goodness of God, ', . .':   380      STEP BY STEP,- OR,G and, besides, I find great comfort in repeating portions of Scripture, and hymns, and poetry, which I learned and committed to memory long ago. So I am never really lonely." "Not when you suffer so greatly?" "No; for then I remember how my Saviour suf- fered on the cross for me, and oh, Miss Delia, when I think of his sufferings, I feel that mine must be light in comparison." And she told Delia in simple, yet earnest language, how real and comforting to her was her Christian faith and experience; how, since her sickness had been upon her, she had gradually, but surely come out of the darkness of a young thoughtless girl's gay life, into the brightness of the Redeemer's kingdom; and how she trusted Mrs. Robbins might be led by her present troubles to a clear knowledge of herself and her sinfulness. Delia had spent so much time with Mrs. Robbins, she found it would not be practicable for her to make all her intended visits. As she was passing Mrs. Gates's door, where Father West lived, she stepped in for a moment to see his placid, kind old face, "to nerve her," as she said to her- herself, to go to Mr. Holton's to deliver a small package and a message   from her aunt. Father West was sitting in his arm-chair, in the corner by the fire. He smiled pleasantly in answer to Delia's inquiries after his health. "Well and hearty, Miss, for an old man, - ninety- five years old,--not quite so spry as this chap," looking at a little grandchild, who was performing various feats of agility, " but every dog has his day, and Pve had mine, and am content to be laid on the   DELIA ARLINGTON.      381    1 shelf, or what's the same thing, put in the chimney - corner now, Miss." "Take'ar," a said Mrs. Gates, won't you, Miss? Father likes visitors."               "Thank you, it's getting late, and I must go to Mr.  Holton's. Aunt Mary heard he was worse."       ; And Delia started off again to her last and least i- agreeable visit; for Mr. Holton was noted for his :  . grumbling propensities, and although in circum-  stances above vant, and constantly receiving kind- ness and aid from his neighbors, was never satisfied. True he was rheumatic, and in the winter confined to the house, but his sufferings were nothing compared with Susan Lee's, yet he found as many causes for , complaint, as she for gratitude. Delia knocked tim-  [ idly at his door, and was admitted by his daughter, who had a weary life of it in taking care of him. Mr. Holton, who was also sitting by the fire, said, as  Delia entered:.  "Well, I 'spose you've come at last from Miss Leslie's,--I reckon she forgot her promise of keep- ing me in intment for my rumatis, -here I've bin  this- " "' Only two days without it, father," interrupted his daughter, "and I'm sure Miss Leslie's real kind allers." "Won't you speak, Liza Ann, when your spoken to,--time enough then to sound your clapper, T calkerlate. As I was saying, Miss, folks that don't suffer, don't know nothin 'bout them as does, I 'spect. Ah, here's some lozengers too,--guess they's the wrong sort though, if Miss Leslie'd only send a little 'bacca now,'" and thus he ran on till Delia's patience was almost exhausted, and she was on the point of   382      STEP BY STEP--OR, speaking hastily, when she encountered the anxious ^ and pleading look of Betsey, his daughter. Upon rising to go, Delia informed Mr. Holton of Mrs. Rob- bins's accident, thinking, perhaps the knowledge of her greater misfortunes might have the effect to make him less sensible of his own temporary privations. "Sarved her right, drunken slut, - I'm glad on't, - it'll give her time to think of her sins," was the sym- pathetic response. To which Delia replied, "Yes, Aunt Leslie thinks it may do her good, to be kept quiet and away from temptation." She did not wait to hear the wrathful answer, that was evidently on the old man's lips, but bidding him a hasty good-bye, returned home, not altogether dis- satisfied with her afternoon's work. "I suppose," said she, in relating the account of her visits to her aunt, "I ought to be satisfied if half my calls were pleasant." "I am afraid you will not always be so fortunate, my dear," was the answer, " as to find that propor- tion of cheerful people to the complaining. Unhap- pily, even Christians allow themselves to repine at their troubles, forgetting that the same hand which dispenses trials to discipline, sends blessings also." *   DELIA ARLINGTON.       383     d CHAPTER XII.  "Faith alone can interpret life, and the heart that aches and bleeds  ;. with the stigmaI Of pain, alone bears the likeness of Christ, and can comprehend. its dark enigma."  "ONGFELLOW. DELIA sympathized with Duncan in many of his tastes and pursuits; in none more keenly than in his   I love of poetry. If Snakespeare was so familiar to iHoward as to become household words on his lips,    : Duncan delighted no less in the lofty genius of Milton, and drank deep draughts " of pure refresh-  ment " from the glowing and spirited pages of Scott,  and Bryant, and Longfellow, and Barrett, and the  metaphysical Wordsworth. There were seasons, as the Doctor had predicted, when he suffered severely;, then, next to the sweet tones of his mother's voice, reading elevating and comforting passages from the Scriptures, nothing was so soothing to his tried and wearied spirits, as to hear Delia, in her unusually mu-  sical voice, read aloud selections from their favorite  authors.  One mild afternoon, Mrs. Leslie went out on a visit to Mrs. Robbins, leaving Delia in the care of her cousin, who was lying on a couch in his own room. "What shall I read to you, Duncan?" she asked,  as her aunt departed.  "Miss Barrett's 'Rhapsody of Life's Progress,' if you please, cousin. Her words, (Oh Life ' Oh Beyond!  Thou art strange, thou art sweet,' ' ,  -                  ..:   384       STEP BY STEP,--- OR, are haunting my memory, and I should like to hear you read the whole aloud; there is something in it so inspiriting, as she describes the different stages through which one passes; and the close is so sub- lime, in which, while admitting the body's weakness, she asserts the soul's triutmph. Oh it is all true, Delia, -true of struggles in life, which, boy as I am, have seemed to me almost as keen as the separation of the soul from the body. 'We are glorious and die,' seems to me to apply to-the state of mind one is in when he dies to his cherished plans in life; dies willingly, resignedly; yet it is a glory not from one- self, but God-given." "I should think," said Delia, " that Miss Barrett must have had large experience, to write so feelingly and so truly. How perfect her picture of childhood is, and how true to the magnified vision of that age is this: ' And the lilies look large as the trees; And as loud as the birds, sing the bloom-loving bees; And the birds sing like angels, so mystical, fine; And the cedars are brushing the archangels' feet; And time is eternity, -love is divine, And the world is complete!' " "( Yes," answered Duncan, "I remember when we lived oh the old place, how grand I thought every thing was. The rocks in the pasture back of the house seemed of giant size; the little pond, a lake; the hill at the right, a lofty mountain. I shall never forget the pang of disappointment I experienced when I went there last summer, after an absence of four- years; everything was so insignificant; looked so pigmy-lilce, compared with my impressions of them., It made me sad, till mamma told me that, painful   DELIA ARLINGTON.      385 as my disappointment might be, it was capable of teaching a great lesson, showing the infinite aspira-w tions of the mind and soul, 'and foreshadowing the insignificance of everything earthly, in comparison with the eternal. And I suppose it is so ;, I suppose as we grow older, and the mind is enlarged by culti- vation, we look back upon each past' stage of our lives with wonder, almost, at what were then our absorbing interests and pursuits; and the day will come, yes, I am sure it will, when we shall see clearly the wisdom and love which have 'given to some mortals the cup of suffering to drain, while that of others sparkles and overflows with joy." Duncan made no further comment while Delia was reading, but she noticed a shadow passing over his brow at the description of the exuberant life of youth, and when she finished, he repeated as if unconscious- ly: ("Yes, ' Oh Death! Oh Beyont! Thou art sweet, thou art strange.' "I like to think of death, Delia," he continued, "not that I wish to die; for I have still a great deal to live for, but the subject has, of late, a strange, mysterious fascination for me. I dreamed I was dead, the other night;-- may I tell you the dream? It was a strange one, and I have not even told it to my mother, because, because, Delia, I was afraid it would make her sad." "I should like to hear it," she replied. "I thought," he proceeded, " that I was dead and lay in my coffin; that is, my body lay there, insensible to everything, but that I inyself, my spirit, was with you all, just as it now is, and seemed bounded still by 33   386     STEP BY STEP,--OR, this material world. I saw how sad and afflicted you all were, and I thought you would- not be so if you only knew I was with you and loved you as of old; you would not care for my body, the crumbling clay, if you only knew how near I was to each one. Bye and bye an angel came to me, and took me by the hand and led me away, whither I could not tell, but it seemed to be into a boundless region, where all the acts of my life and all the consequences of them, appeared spread out before me, as in a great, living, moving picture; how, I could not discover; but there they were, right before me, whatever way I turned; and I saw what important results had proceeded from acts, apparently the most trifling, and how what I had regarded deeds of little moment, too trivial to be thought of the second time, had even been written down in the book that is ever open, as evidences of my right to be considered one of the children of the kingdom. As I gazed upon the living panorama before me, with an intenseness that made me forget everything else, the angel touched me as if to get my attention, and said: ' You have been mortal, and have sinned; but you have repented, and now you are accepted and redeemed, - an immortal being, - and it is given unto you to look upon the world you have left, and the world you are about to enter.' For an instant all was dark, and then it appeared that we were floating, the angel and I, in space, midway between heaven -and earth, -and I could look up to the one, and down upon the other. Of heaven, the first impression made upon my mind, was, that it is boundless in extent, as it is eternal in duration. But I saw nothing clearly, for the radiance and glory, thereof were too dazzling, even for my disembodied   DELIA ARLINGTON.      387 spirit to gaze upon; but I received two impressions; one of a purity, of which earth has no likeness; and the other of a glory, which no mortal pen can de- scribe; and I exclaimed, ' Oh how pure, how glorious!' ' Yes,' answered the angel at my side, ' yes, young immortal, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Glory be to God in the highest, now and evermore.' "When I looked upon the earth, which seemed at first a mere speck in space, everything was confused and indistinct, but gradually there rose before me, visions so wild and strange, that I turned to my celestial companion and asked what it all meant. 'Watch,' he answered, ' and you will soon under- stand; you will see how mortals employ the talents God has given them.' Delia, I cannot tell you what I saw; it was so dark and painful to look upon; al- though, indeed, there were many and many a gleam of sunshine out-bursting from good deedskind words, and holy thoughts, where some of them would scarce- ly have been looked for; but there was so much sin,  so much suffering, so much wanton turning of God's blessings into curses, that I was very sad and wept. This the angel observing, looked upon me tenderly, and said, in a voice so gentle and so full of holy love, that I never can forget how it sounded: ( Young im- mortal, what is there on earth to regret? what is there not in heaven to desire?' "Then I awoke; but the dream is even now as distinct to -me as if it were a reality of yesterday. I do not consider it a warning that my time on earth is short, so much as an admonition to reprove me for the folly of repining over that which might have, led me astray; for one scene vividly before me at this   388      STEP BY STEP,--OR,         - moment, is that of a minister of Christ's Gospel, utwardly holy and pure, while inwardly he was devoured by the demon of ambition, and his soul was all sordid and tarnished. That might have been my own case, Delia."' As he concluded, his face shone as if, indeed, he had been conversing with angels, and a light from the heavenly world was round about him, and the smile upon his lip had in it a sweetness in which no feeling of earth could be traced. "It is a strange dream, Duncan," said Delia, after a pause; "but perhaps you can trace it in part to your own thoughts; and perhaps, also, dreams may some- times be actually sent by God, for our comfort and instruction in this present life.". "Perhaps so," was the answer. "At all events, this has comforted and instructed me, while it has sad- dened me. It has taught me how impossible it is for us to foresee what is for our good, or what may turn to our injury; or rather, I should say, perhaps, it has led me to consider how impossible this is. Ah, faith is what we need most of all, to enable us to bear our burdens cheerfully, be they ever so heavy." "Yes, Duncan, it is really so. How happy Susan Lee and Father West are, and yet what heavy trials they have to bear." "Most true, Delia; Father West has outlived all his children, but the daughter with whom he now resides. He has had ten children, mamma told me. But he was never known to murmur or complain that his lot was a hard one, or that he had more than his share of trial and suffering. When his wife was taken from him, and when his children, one after an- other, died, some at home under the cottage roof that   DELIA ARLINGTON.      38 9 sheltered their infancy, some by violent disease abroad, and one by the hand of an assassin, although he mourned their loss in deep sorrow of heart, he never failed to see the love of his heavenly Father in it all. 'It is the Lord's doings,' he would say. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'"   390      STEP BY STEP,--OR,  CHAPTER     XIII. "He that Foretells his own calamity and makes Events before they come, twice over doth Endure the pains of evil destiny." IT was the joyous, heart thrilling, soul awakening season of spring. Winter, with its icy blasts, its chill snows, its short but radiant days, had gone, and every- where nature gave tokens of resurrection from death unto life., The birds sang sweetly and rejoicingly in their leafy bowers, making the morning glad with their melody; the tender grass -put forth its blade; the wild and early garden flowers sent forth their fragrance, as if to contribute each its mite to the universal praise, which daily and hourly ascended up on high, to that Being, who created, and who upholds all things. Delia, who had ever delighted in Nature, and who now, that she learned to look through Nature up to Nature's God, beholding the tokens of His power, -and wisdom, and goodness everywhere, felt on the return of this season particularly,-always in other years exhilarating to her as it is to the young,--an exuberance of happiness she could scarcely account for. Yet when she reflected, how manifold her bless- ings were, and how many causes for thankfulness and happiness the past year had unsealed to her, she wondered no longer at the state of her mind. Now, indeed, life to her was "real," life to her was "ear- nest," but it was a reality and an earnestness in which the elements of hope and enjoyment, natural to her'age, were mingled.   DELIA ARLINGTON.      391 She had passed what she had good -reason for con- sidering a profitable as well as a happy winter; she had been diligent at her studies, and sustained a high rank at school; she had made herself useful to her aunt and cousins; and she had done what she could in her visits among the poor and unfortunate to serve them.                 ' If little mention has been made in these pages of such pleasures or recreations as the young are accustomed to indulge in, it must not be supposed that she had none, or that shewas indifferent to the enjoyments adapted to her age. On the contrary, it was one of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie's aims to provide for their young people such amusements as should render home attractive to them, and at the same time supply a want of their natures as imperative in ardent, joyous youth, as any social, intellectual, or moral want at any other period of life. No voice rang clearer in the comic song, or sounded more gleeful in the merry laugh, than Delia's; no step was lighter in the social dance or quicker in the evening games; no mind was more active, none more ingenious in charades, or " capping verses," guessing proverbs, or " what is my thought like," than hers. During the long winter evenings, she, had added greatly to the in-door happiness of the family at Wal- nut Hill by her untiring efforts to enter with spirit into whatever was the business or the pleasure of the hour. Howard seemed never wearied in declaring  that his sister-was the very life of the house. Although spring did not bring much "a healing on its wings " to Duncan, it added greatly to his pleas- ures, as he could walk short distances in the grounds, or be wheeled through their whole extent, and even into some of the quiet shady lanes inl their imme- diate neighborhood.   uVrl     bSTEP BY STEP- OR, When Delia first saw him in his garden-chair, a pang of pain shot through her heart, as it brought so vividly to her recollection the invalid of the preced- ing summer, and the trying scenes which she then passed through. But the calm serenity of Duncan's face, amounting at times to a holy sweetness, such as one imagines to have been that of the Apostle John, beloved of the Lord, forbade a parallel between the two cases; for it was evident to every one, however severe his bodily sufferings might be, his mind was at peace, reposing confidingly in the goodness of his heavenly Father. Mrs. Leslie, to whose nature it belonged to rejoice with those who rejoiced, partook also of the general gladness; although to the affectionate eye of her niece, her face seemed paler and thinner than ever, as the season advanced, which pained her loving heart with a certain indefinable fear, too vague, however, and uncertain for utterance. The younger children frolicked and frisked about like lambs in the sunshine, and sported on the lawn, or in the meadows by the little brook, which wound its devious way through the lower grounds at Wal- nut Hill; while Harry seemed almost wild with delight at his entire emancipation from the restraints of winter; and even Algernon's staid countenance assumed a more lively expression. Aunt Charlotte was the only member of the family who did not share in the general feeling of happiness. Ever ingenious in discovering causes for anxiety and alarm, she became a prey to tormenting fears on ac- count of her son, long before it was time to look for his return. Mr. and Mrs. Leslie did all they could to allay her anxieties, but like Rachel of old, she would   DELIA ARLINGTON.      393 not be comforted, and clung to them with a persis- tency, which at last actually disturbed her sister's more equable temperament. "Why, aunt," said Howard, one day, after she had been disconsolately scanning the papers for tidings of the good ship "Welcome," and had nervously laid it down with a heavy sigh; "why, aunt, it is not quite time yet for Leslie to be expected; you know it is a long voyage." "I know it is, Howard, but Captain Norris is a man whose fast ship is never beaten by any other, and here is the arrival of the Lucy Lee, which sailed two days after the Welcome." "Yes, aunt, but Capt. Norris may have been de- tained beyond the time he expected to sail, when Leslie wrote." "No, Howard, Capt. Norris never makes any such bad calculation as that. Ah, my heart misgives me; there is trouble in store for me, I feel very sure; indeed, what else is there to expect in a world where man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward." '"Well, aunt, you know fifty things might have happened to cause a delay, without any serious accident occurring. Besides, Les has been ship- wrecked once, and it is not at all likely he will be again." "I don't see why not just as likely to be ship- wrecked twice as once. Well, well, I've one comfort, Increase was always a good boy, and as for me, why, it doesn't matter; trouble will come in one shape  or another; it always did come to me, and it always will." "It comes to us all, sister," said Mrs. Leslie, in her mild tones, " because it is as inevitably our portion ..   394      STEP BY -STEP,- OR, in this world as joy and gladness, but it is scarcely . wise, is it, to anticipate it?" "No, perhaps not; but you know, sister Mary, I never could see things as you and brother William do; it's not my nature, and even grace won't help me in this matter. You see everything on its brightest side, and 1, perhaps, on its darkest; you enjoy all you can, till sorrow comes; I dare not enjoy anything, for fear of the grief, which I am certain will follow; you enjoy the beauty and gladness of spring; at that season, I can't help thinking of the decay and death, which a few short months will bring. In short, God has made us to differ; I cannot see life as -you do, after all that can be said and done." Mrs. Norton was right; she could not, and only divine grace could, in some degree modify the unfor- tunate effects of early education upon a mind natural- ly disposed to gloom and depression. For all that, Mrs. Norton was a Christian, a sincere, devoted, pray- erful Christian, lacking, it is true, that full measure of faith, which was alike strength and comfort to her brother and sister in the trials and- sorrows appointed to them. Yet she had faith in God and in Christ, and in the Holy Spirit, and would have been shocked at such complaining in another as seemed to be a part of her nature. She did not, as many another Christian has failed to do, see the hand of God in those circumstances of life, which were apparently of trifling moment; and consequently her failure in submission, in those minor afflictions, which came upon her as upon others. But at the same time in great trials, in those severe chast- enings of the Lord, at which the stoutest heart is often melted and subdued, she was as humble and   DELIA ARLINGTON,      395 submissive as a child, and bore her appointed lot in true Christian fortitude, much to the surprise of those, who only knew her in her almost daily querulousness . at little perplexities and annoyances; and who are unacquainted with that peculiar characteristic of some minds, which in mistaken notions of Deity, is unable to see that alike the falling of the sparrow and the overthrow of nations, are His all-wise appoint- ments. Day after day she went gloomily about the house, the only shadow upon its peaceful, cheerful life. But as days became weeks, and still no tidings from the ship Welcome, all shared in her anxiety, and strange as it may seem, her own depression of spirits became less intense as the general solicitude with regard to her absent son increased. At last news came; but they were of a- nature to extinguish the last spark of hope in the most san- guine of the family, with the exception of Howard, who pertinaciously declared Leslie would yet return. These tidings were, to the following effect: "Arrived at New York, the ship Venture, Hardy,  from Canton. On the passage, Mar. 18th, Lat. 19 S., Long. 16 W., picked up two casks marked with the letter W., and a part of the quarter board of a vessel, a good deal charred, but on which the letters WE   ME were legible; supposed to be portions of the ship Welcome, of Boston, in regard to whose fate there has-been much painful anxiety for several weeks past. There can be little doubt now that she was burned at sea, and all on board perished." "]   396        STEP BY STEP --OR, CHAPTER XIV. "Let us be patient. These severe afflictions Not from the ground arise, But oftentimes celestial benedictions Assume this dark disguise." LONGFELLOW.' "New York, June, 184-. "Summer, glorious summer has come, Delia, and from the window of my room at Woodlawn I -look down upon the broad and beautiful Hudson at my feet, sparkling and gleaming in the light of a June sun. How much this glorious view brings back to my mind last season, and my dear, absent friend. Your enthusiastic descriptions of your home life, your betrayed but not acknowledged devotion to your aunt and cousins, have done me good. I am trying more and more to repress this heedless, selfish nature within me, and to sympathize more than I have hitherto done with my mother in her tastes and pursuits; and I think I have in a:degree succeeded, although I find it a great undertaking to keep such a giddy disposition as mine in check. I feel thatI - was created and placed in this beautiful world for better things than to satirize and ridicule follies in society. "I am truly grateful to you, Delia, for your letters, and I trust the day will come when I shall be more worthy of your friendship. This is not mock humility. I am as ready, and always was, to acknowledge superiority as to ridicule pretension, and I do assure you I am no flatterer either. What I have said in your praise is only to let you know how much good you have done me. Now we will let that pass. "My brother has returned from India. It was the merest chance, the slightest ' breath of accident,' as it were, that pre- vented him from taking passage on board the ill-fated ship Wel- come, from Canton, whither he went from Calcutta, partly on business and partly to meet a friend. He had made arrangements for embarking in the Welcome, when he accidentally met another friend, who, he supposed, was in New York, and was persuaded   DELIA ARLINGTON.          397 by him to remain a day longer and take the Lucy Lee. Oh, Delia, you can judge of my own and my mother's feelings, when we heard of the probable fate of that unfortunate ship, and of the Providence that restored my brother to us. He says Mr. Norton was very highly esteemed in Canton by those who knew him, as a man of irreproachable character and great business ability. This will be some consolation to his mother and your aunt's family. "Do you know how the spirit of enterprise and steam has in- vaded the banks of dear old Hudson. Ah, could they not have left us unspoiled this beautiful region, immortalized by the poetic prose of our own Washington Irving? No, nothing in this coun- try is sacred to her money-loving children; and as I look again from my window, I see scores of She sons of Erin with spade and pickaxe preparing a way for the dark but fiery demon, who drags after him so fiercely and furiously, yet so unresistingly, hundreds of our race; and who, alas! sometimes whirls them to swift destruction. In plain, common-sense language, Irishmen are ac- tually preparing the ground for a railroad track. Our grounds, you know, never extended to the water, so we are spared the dese- cration of our immediate territories, but many a fair domain on this bank of our noble river will be marred, and its beauty well- nigh destroyed.. Will money pay for it? I have my doubts. It is said that the peculiar attractions of Judge Grafton's place will be very much injured. . I could have cried from vexation when I remembered whose hands were digging. away the earth close by your dear little Cape Hope, which must ever be a sacred spot to you. But this is a great country, and we are a great people; so it is said in the halls of Congress, upon the rostrum, in the pulpit, and by the press,--and so we must be reconciled to all innova- tions upon our most cherished associations. "Speaking' of Judge Grafton's place, reminds me of him. He has actually become a member of the Rev. Dr. -- church, and goes to the utmost extent of rigidity in his religious observances and habits, while his wife is more worldly than ever. Maria is said to be flirting with a French Count,--how true it is, I cannot say with certainty. Clara has shot up into a very tall, stylish girl, very like other girls in her circle. I confess to a good deal of sympathy for-Judge Grafton, - he seems so alone in the world. It is said he now leaves his family very much to themselves, and 34   398       STEP BY STEP,-   OR, renmins a great part of the time alone in the city, while Mrs. Grrafto :  and her daulghters are away at fashionable watering pliaces. \\ ould he not listen to you, Dalia?

Who knows, &c? "' No more at present,' as Irish Bridget dictates to me at the close of her letters. "From your friend, ' ADIE LAWTON." Delia showed this letter to her Aunt Miary, who communicated to Mrs. Norton what was said respect-         ing her son, whom  she now regarded as dead.   She      i heard it unmoved, and then said: "I lnow Increase      was good, that is, as good as any one can be in this world; but I am   resigned to his death.   God has       given me strength to bear the only last affliction He       i could mete out to me.   My boy was my all, and yet God knew  I deserved to lose him.   I was unthan!k-  ful, rebellious and complaining, and He alone knew what was the discipline I needed, and as for Increase, why it is well with the child, and I am resigned. By and by, sister Mary, you shall see that I am not uln- grateful for your kindness, or all insensibility to your' good example; bear with me yet a little longer, for   DELIA ARLINGTON,      399 he was my all, you know, and how dear he was to this tried, sorrow-striclien heart, only those can have any idea who have lavished their whole wealth of affections, - affections the more intense, because so long repressed,-upon one object, and that object a worthy son. Yet I say, God has dealt very merci- fully with me, and I murmur not." And she did not murmur as she had previously done, either about this last great affliction, or about such lesser trials and vexations as had hitherto dis- turbed her life. Whenever she alluded to the sub- ject, and there were times when she poured the full tide of her emotions into Mrs. Leslie's sympathetic ear, it was always in the spirit of perfect submission to the will of God. It seemed as if this dispensa- tion, - the heaviest, saving her son's disgrace, - that could have been sent upon her, had opened her eyes to her own unchristian complaints and repinings about matters, if not altoetiher pleasant, of trifling moment. A cloudy day, an east wind, a storm, a torn dress, ,a missing article of her wardrobe, were now  no longer to her the  mountains of disturbance they had once been; but on the contrary, were dwindled into the mole hills they really were, too insignificant to discourage or annoy any   one whose faith is steadfast and unmovable in Him who doeth all things well. And strange as it may seem, now that Mrs. Nor- ton had drunk of this cup of bitter sorrow, she no longer spoke of this world as a vale of tears, or of man as being born to trouble as the sparks fly upward, - but on the contrary, she took a more cheerful view of life and its duties than hitherto. It was as if a veil   400      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, had been rent from before her eyes, through whose medium she had been seeing everything around her in a vague, dismal light. The twins looked with wonder at Aunt Charlotte;  she was so much kinder and gentler to them than she  used to be, and feeling that the loss of cousin "Les," the favorite of the whole family, was indeed a sad thing, they clung to her with an affection she had never been able to inspire before. They loved now,  they said, to have her tell them stories of good chil- dren, and about the heaven, into which their, dear cousin had gone, and the result was that they, in their love and kindness, helped to fill the void in her aching heart; for who can live without some object of affec- tion in a world, where love is or should be the basis v of happiness? Whatever gleams of hope others might entertain ! that Leslie would yet be restored to them, none ever came to the mother's heart. She had the feeling,  t -which she often expressed, that she needed the chas- : tisement, and consequently nothing was farther from her thoughts than the possibility that he might return, saved by some of those almost miraculous chances, which go far to prove that there is an appointed time  for all to die, and that the providence of God watches over all, alike those upon the sea and those upon the X land, and that his wisdom ordains the portion of joy and of sorrow, which falls to each one of his   children. The first effect of the newspaper paragraph upon  Mrs. Norton, which confirmed all her anxieties, was  almost overwhelming, so deep and ardent was the   love this outwardly cold and sometimes harsh mother bore her son; but, as she said, her affections were the !   DELIA ARLINGTON.      401 more intense because she had so unnaturally striven to repress them.  Now, oh! what would she not have given to have  had it in her power to tell him, whom her fancy pic- tured in his cold ocean bed, how fondly she had ever loved him. Too late, alas! too late for his happiness on earth, she felt, came this regret; but need it be too ! late for her own eternal welfare?"No," she thought,  "I have erred, I have sinned, but I will strive to do so' no longer."                       I And she called up her Christian faith and her  Christian hope, and she cried aloud to her God, and  He heard and sustained her with the right arm of his strength, and, as we have seen, she bore her affliction in a manner surprising to all her friends, and, although she still carried in her heart a sorrow, whose shadow- I was ever round about her, it was a shadow which softened her feelings and refined her character, as the passing cloud often veils imperfections in the 1 natural world, which in the full blaze of the mid-   I day sun, would stand forth in rude and inharmonious  'relief.-i "Aunt Mary," said Delia, after the former had fin- ished. reading Adie Lawton's letter, "do you not  think I ought to go to New York in the autumn? I am almost afraid it will be my duty to do so."    "Yon cannot decide the question yet, my child, and it is fortunate you cannot until the two years have expired.  It may be your duty to go then, and  if it should be, I have no doubt- you will go cheer- fully." "Oh! Aunt, 'I am  so much better and so much happier here, I cannot bear to think that it may be so; and yet it is so sad for a man like Judge Grafton 34*i' f   to be in such a state of mind, and nobody to care for him; and, if any one can do anything for him, I  think I could on account of Fred, you lknow-; and yet, Aunt Mary, he has never expressed a wish to have me back again." "No, my dear, because he knew it was your father's wish that you should be left entirely to your own judgment and preferences in making the decis- ion. I think, if I were you, my dear, I should not dwell much upon the subject at present. Your Uncle Edward will be able to advise you at the proper time. I hope you will see your way clear to make your permanent home with us, but I cannot ask it if duty calls you elsewhere. Wherever you are, I want you to feel that you are my daughter in 4 love, and to this home your mother's heart will always be most glad to welcome you." "But I can never be as good anywhere else, dear  I aunt, as I can be here." Mrs. Leslie shook her head and smiled. "That is quite a negative kind of goodness, my dear, that de- pends on place. I trust the house of your faith is not ? founded upon sand, which the first adverse blast will  overthrow. No, no, Delia, gather up strength here and, now, -if you have the feeling that it is well- for your religious discipline to be here,--for future conflicts and trials. They will come, my child, they will come 1 as surely on your fair young head, and to your hope- ful happy heart, as they come to us all;- but what matters it if God be with you, and His strong arm upholds you. Weak as you are in yourself, in Him, your weakness is made strength, which nought on earth can overcome." "Aunt Mary," said Delia, "I fear you are ill, and /E   will not let any one know how sick you are. Indeed, I am very sure you are a great sufferer. I can never leave you on any account until I see you looking better." Mrs. Leslie's face immediately changed to a deeper paleness, and she was silent a moment, then said: " You are right, Delia, I did not wish to sadden your young life with the knowledge of the painful disease, which, alas ! is now progressing with giant strides; but I think you have self-possession to hear calmly what I cannot long conceal from you." And Mrs. Leslie told her niece how a disease that had been preying upon her for years, had during the past winter come to a crisis, and that now her only chance for life was a painful and dangerous opera- tion. " Oh, Aunt Mary, Aunt Mary, how can you be so cheerful, so happy ?" " Not of myself, Delia." Delia was so shocked by the intelligence her aunt had given her, that she knew not what to say, but immediately recollecting that if she would be of any service to her she must first control her own feelings; consequently, gathering up  her strength, she said with as much calmness as she could command: " Aunt Mary, will you let me  do everything I can to assist you this summer?" " Yes, my dear, it was for that reason I was willing to tell you. Doctor Morton says I must avoid all fatigue, and as much as possible all anxiety. The operation cannot be performed until the weather becomes a little cooler. In many ways, as indeed you have already done, you can lighten my cares.    404     STEP BY STEP,--OR, I thought it due to you that you should know why I required so much from you. Now, Delia, I must ask you to leave me, - do not be distressed at what I have told you, but help me to be cheerful. Truly, dear child, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

"The charm that in her spirit lived, No changes could destroy." MRS. HALE. "GOOD morning, Mrs. Robbins, how are you to- day?" said Delia in her clear musical voice, as she opened the little gate which led to the porch where Mrs. Robbins was sitting, busy sewing, one beautiful July afternoon. "Oh! I'm  nicely, Miss, to-day,-take a chair, please,- only this leg of mine grumbles a little if I go to use it much, so when I find t'aint no use tryin' to make it do its duty, I just set right down and sew.  Thanks to Miss Leslie's and Miss Norton's good word, I gits a power of work to do, and then the little gal that's so handy about the house saves me a deal of steps." "But your leg is a great deal stronger than it was a month ago, Mrs. Robbins, when Betsey came to you; then you could not use it much, could you?" "Oh, yes, Miss, it's a deal better than it was then. You musn't think I'm for complaining, because it  don't git right strong again all at once. I know it's   406      STEP BY STEP,--OR, all owing to my old bad ways it's so long getting right, and I'm sure I've reason to bless the Lord for the way I fell on the ice, mad and contrary as I was about it at that time; but as Miss Leslie says, we never know what's good for us, and so it's best to trust in the Lord allers. Do you remember the first time you come to see me, Miss, and how things looked here then. Well, it was all drink what did it, and I don't b'lieve I'd ever gin it up if -I hadn't been laid on my bed, and had them about me who wouldn't listen to my teasing for it. Oh, Miss, I'm thinking Miss Leslie's most too good for this world; she is one of the true sort; she'isn't like a guide-board as I've hearn say some good folks is, allers pintin the way to heaven, but never budging an inch themselves. There's precious few folks that's travelled so fast and so far on that road as she has, I can tell you, weak and feeble like as she is. And l'm sure I'm ever so much obleeged to you, Miss, for coming to see me and read to me, let alone what you done for my boys all the time I was sick. I've been a wicked woman, but I've repented and hope God's forgiven me; and Miss Leslie and you, and my good friends the Doc- ter and Minister shall see yet, I'm not so ungrateful like as may-be I've seemed to be." And she went on in the same strain for some time, for she was naturally a great talker, and now that her heart had been touched, and her best feelings awakened, she never seemed to tire of relating her experiences, and dwelling on the kindness of her true friends. What a change had taken place in the appearance of her house and its little garden since Delia's first visit. In-doors everything was neat and tidy and   DELIA ARLINGTON.      407 orderly; the old furniture had been mended and rub- bed up; a few needful articles of crockery, and some household utensils had been given to her; a glazier had mended her windows in consideration of old times, when Mrs. Robbins and his wife were friends; Dr. Morton's gardener had spent some leisure hours in putting the little plat of ground in order, transplant- ing a few hardy shrubs and easily tended flowers in front of the cottage, and vegetables in the patch be- hind, out of a kindly remembrance he entertained for her on his own account, while others had paid the bills necessary to put the little cottage in decent repair, that she might be encouraged to persevere in the new course she had with so much determina- tion, and in such an humble spirit, entered upon. Now that she had given up her bad habits, every one was disposed to remember her as the pretty modest girl she had been, and not bring up against her the more recent events of her life. In such cases of reformation and amendment as was Mrs. Robbins's, it may be seen that human nature, by its sympathy with the suffering and the struggling, proves itself still to be possessed, 'in some measure, of that divine  likeness. in which it was created. With the excep-.  tion of old Father Holton, in whom the milk of human kindness seemed to be irremediably soured, there was no one who had ever known her, that  lid not speak kindly of, and to, the repentant widow. The brothers Cheeryble were rejoiced that they  *ould now visit their favorite playfellows in their  wNn home, which formerly they had not been al-  owed to do.  As Delia left the cottage and went on her way to lake her other calls, she thought how much more    408      STEP BY STEP,- OR, blessed it was to give than to receive, and she was thankful that she herself had been able to overcome the feelings of repugnance so natural to a refined and fastidious nature which had so much troubled her on her first visits to Mrs. Robbins, and that she had also been able to contribute, in some degree, as she hoped, to her improvement, and add to her happi- ness by devoting a portion of her time daily to her. She reflected with pleasure upon the other visits of a similar nature she had made, in the consciousness, however, that in those to Father West and Susan Lee, she had received more good than it had been possible for her to impart, so salutary was the im- pression which their cheerful faith, and child-like sub- mission to their Heavenly Father's will, made upon her mind. Her way home lay through the wood, where last autumn she had cantered at Howard's side, now fresh and glowing with the rich life of summer; and all nature seemed to be in unison with the spirit of joyful gratitude and praise that filled her heart. A year ago she had taken by the hand, and led along in the path of faith and hope a repentant fellow crea- ture, while yet her own feet were not fully assured of the way they sought to walk; but God had been with her, and his word had been the lamp to guide her. Now her vision was clearer, and she knew what she believed, and in whom she trusted, and she was looking forward with longing, yet with trembling, to the time when she should publicly acknowledge Him "who had brought life and immortality to light in his gospel." And her faith and her hopes were adding immeasurably to her happiness. Delia's summer vacation of six weeks had just   DELIA ARLINGTON.      409 commenced, and she was entering with- keen delight into its recreations, and improving with grateful af- fection the opportunity her leisure afforded her of being more with her aunt, and of relieving her in every way in her power of her cares. Perhaps there was less gayety in the household than during the last season, for all were affected more or less, not only by sympathy with Aunt Charlotte, but also by their own tender recollections of him, who had been dear almost as a son and elder brother in that house, in which so many years of his life had been passed) but there was the same atmosphere of cheerful happiness as of old. If Howard was less lively in his. conversation and manners, less playful and Shakespearian as occasions arose, it was perhaps as becoming in one about to leave school, and enter the busy arena of his chosen pursuit, as his former exuberance of spirits had been. When Delia returned from her walk, her face glowing with the flush of health, and her blue eyes bright with rays from the spirit within, it was to meet and be embraced by her Uncle Edward, whose arri- val was unexpected for two weeks at least. "Oh, uncle," she said, after her first exclamations of wonder and surprise were over, "this is almost too much happiness." "Then I'll take my trunks and be off to the White Mountains, whither I intended to take you; but if you are in an excess of happiness, 'twould hardly be safe. Why, how well my birdie looks. After all," said he fondly, "you'll make quite a pre- sentable young lady two or three years hence." "I hope so, uncle," was the laughing reply. "I shouldn't like to be unpresentable. And as for-your 85           ::.? * '                 itj.    r-e-   o; I tr vJX Y sl'ri - OR - running off, you know joy never kills; so please let me be as happy as I can, while yet I may," she added almost sadly. Mr. Howard looked at his niece inquiringly, and as they were alone she told him all her fears for her Aunt Mary; and her state of indecision with regard to her own future. "For the future, child, trouble not yourself," re- plied the uncle, " but 'leave to time what is time's own.' With respect to your aunt," Here he rose and walked about hastily as was his habit when struggling with his feelings. Presently he came and sat down by her, and said: "For the time being, Delia, your duty lies very plainly before you, and it coincides with your inclina- tions I am sure. Your Aunt Mary has a calm, equable temperament, which will add greatly to her chances of recovery,- and we will hope for the best, -the best according to our views of it, which, you know, may be a mistaken one; and now my child we will make this summer a pleasant one if we can, so that whatever betides, we may at least look back upon it as one of the golden periods of our earthly pilgrimage." And with those resolves, and those interests, they passed the glorious summer season, and although the shortening days, the chill evenings, and the early falling leaves betokened the near approach of autumn, Mr. Howard still remained at Walnut Hill, contributing greatly to the pleasure of all; for he had thrown off much of the reserve that had so long hidden his true character from many of his friends, and appeared as he was, or rather as he had been years before, warm-hearted, genial, kind and   DELIA ARLINGTON.      4" social; and he gave forth the treasures of his own poetic intellect, and the gems of thought he had col- lected from the choicest authors in the long years of his student life, to instruct and amuse the interested circle that gathered around him, and each and all declared,"there is no one so entertaining as Uncle Edward;" for while his conversation was always elevating, he could readily adapt himself to the dif- ferent tastes of the members of a household, in which there was great diversity of character. On the other hand, the atmosphere of love and kindness he breathed at Walnut Hill, had warmed his heart and unloosed the icy fetters of self-imposed restraint, which had so long bound him. He never mentioned his journey to the White Mountains again, and Delia knew he would not wish her to speak of it. In intimate companionship with the dearly loved brother of her youth, Mrs. Leslie dwelt as little as possible upon her now rapidly approaching hour of peril, and again and again did she say, "Oh, Edward, a good Providence has brought you to me, when I most needed you." And it was a good Providence truly; for devoted as Mr. Leshe was to his wife, an unusual pressure of business kept him away from her side, even more than ordinarily was the case, and it was an inexpressible relief to him, that her brother could in a measure take his place. In Duncan, Mr. Howard discovered tastes and traits of character that carried him back to his own early enthusiastic youth, and he encouraged and strengthened his nephew in enduring his trial, by assuring him that he might yet be able to pursue a quiet literary career, and in that way serve his fellow   "2      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, men, if the more active calling in which he had hoped to engage, was denied to him. "Duncan is like me," Mr. Howard frequently said to his sister, " save in the dark cloud which rested on my faith, - that his early education has happily spared him."   VELIA ARLINGTON.       413  CHAPTER XVI.  "For heaven doth know, so shall the world perceive, That I have turned away my former self." SHAKESPEARE. "MAY-BE its all just as you say, Mr. Barton, but I'd rather speak to Miss Leslie about it afore I make up my mind; not meaning any disrespect to you either, sir, but you see Miss Leslie knows me better than you; she knows all my backslidins, and sins begun afore ever you come and settled 'mongst us; and then somehow there's nobody whose 'pinion weighs on me quite like hern; 'cause you know she's just as true as daylight, and I know she'll tell me what she thinks, good or bad; only if it's bad she'll put it in sich a pretty way as not to take the heart out of one like as some folk do." This was said by Mrs. Robbins, in reply to an appeal from her minister urging'her to unite with the church. "By all means, speak to Mrs. Leslie, Mrs. Rob- bins," said Mr. Barton, "and be guided by her advice; it is very natural that you should wish to consult her.- I will call again in a week or two, to have some further conversation, and hear your decision. A large number will unite with the church at our next com- munion, and it would be a great gratification to me, and to others, to see you among them, illn the strength of a holy purpose, consecrating yourselfto your God, in the name and as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is what your Saviour expects and requires of   "4      STEP BY STEP---OR           you, if, as I trust is the case, you have sincerely re- pented of your sins, and are cherishing in your heart an earnest desire to be transformed in the, spirit of your mind by the Holy Ghost, and to walk hence- forth in the precepts and commandments of the New Testament blameless; and what your Saviour thus expects and requires of you is no more than your reasonable service, and you should regard it as one of your greatest earthly privileges. And it shall not be in vain. Thus shall your faith save your soul. As to your sins, hear what the word of the Lord saith: 'Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be like crimson, they shall be as wool.'" With these words he left her; and she sat some moments lost in thought, and then said half aloud, half to herself: "Ay, that's a comfort, I must say; I've led a wicked life of it, these few years back, but I know the vilest sinner may return, and I may yet be washed white in the blood of the Lamb. Ill go and see Miss Les- lie this very hour." So saying, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and took her canes and hobbled off to Mrs. Leslie's, who fortunately was alone and disengaged. Mrs. Robbins had not seen her for many weeks. Although she knew she had not been well, she was ignorant of the nature of her malady, and was not prepared for so great a change in her kind friend, since their last interview. "Bless my heart, Miss Leslie," she exclaimed,  "how pale you look, -hope I don't intrude." "Oh, no, Mrs. Robbins, I was wishing I could go   DELIA ARLINGTON.      415 to see you, but I am scarcely able to get out. I have wished to speak with you with regard to uniting with our church; there is no time like the present, you know, for putting good resolutions into practice. Uniting with the church will set a seal, as it were, upon your good intentions, but I vould urge upon you the step for a higher and holier reason than this." "Why, mrarm, that's the very thing I come to talk about; have you seen Mr. Barton?" "Yes, I spoke of you to him, and he said he would call and talk with you." "Then you think, Miss Leslie, that I'm good enough to jine the church? You know, as I told Mr. Barton, jest the life I've been leadin; and only think, less than a year ago, how I used to talk, swear, and run on," and she shuddered at the recollection of her former impious language. "Yes, Mrs. Robbins, I know it; but one great cause, indeed the chief cause of all your sin, was your fatal habit of intemperance. That was indeed putting an enemy into your mouth to steal away your brains!' Before you formed that dreadful habit, even after your misfortunes, you were a decent, orderly, well- behaved woman; you yielded to that fatal vice, and it made you what you have been; but now you have abjured it, I trust, forever; and if you have sincerely repented of your past life, and have resolved that, with God's grace helping you, you will be a different woman for the future, you will be welcomed, as you have a right to sit down, at the table of your divine Master, who ' came not to call the righteous, but sin- ners to repentance."' "Oh, Miss Leslie, I see it all now; how wicked I   "6     STEP BY STEP,--OR, was, and how proud I was. I married Jim, who was a good fellow all but for drink, spite of all advice, he was so handsome and smart lookin; and I thought we should get up in the world. But bye and bye when he begun to go back to his evil courses, I got cross and fretty with him; perhaps if I'd been pleas-: anter like he'd never been so bad, but I got angry to be a byeword 'mongst them I once thought beneath me; and then I got discouraged, and we quarrelled dreadfully; and then after that dreadful tirne, when my little gal died, my baby, my darlin, I gin right up and become as bad as Jim, fall, and a great sight worse I think now; for I'd never the temptations of bad company, that he had. And,-for I must tell you all the truth, marm, if it does go right to my heart, my conscience was never quite clear 'bout the child ; for I vexed him that night about his bad ways and 'bout how he couldn't support his wife and chil- dren, and he got furious and'aimed a blow at me, and it knocked the baby out of my arms, and then--" Here she paused and covered her face with her hands. "Well after that I didn't care for nothin, and, I drinked whenever I could get it. From that night, Jim went from bad to worse, till he drinked himself to death; and so I went on three four years- in my evil courses, and become what I was when I fell on the ice. And now do -you think, Miss Leslie, I'm fit to sit down at the Lord's table side by side with you?             ' "Yes, Mrs. Robbins, if you truly repent, and I can- not doubt you do, from your forgiving spirit towards your unfortunate husband. Without that spirit, you would not be in a proper state of mind to offer your- self as a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus."   DELIA ARLINGTON.      417 "I'm sure I've forgiven Jim, ever since I was sick, " there, last winter. I'd time then to think it all over, and somehow it all come over me then how I was in the wrong too, and how if I'd done differently, may- be, it might have been different with him, and then when Miss Delia used to come and read to me out of  ; the Bible and good books, it opened my eyes more   A like to my own share of the wrong, and it's that, that troubles me now." "It is very natural and proper, Mrs. Robbins, that i you should have such feelings, but you should not dwell upon them too much; that is, you should not let what is past discourage you from making- right efforts for the future. The Apostle Paul says of him- self, that he forgot the things which are behind, and reached forth unto those that are before. So must all Christians do, There are none who have not sinned, and come short of the reasonable requirements of our holy religion, and-who do not need God's forgive- ness every day. But our trust is not in ourselves, in our own strength or goodness, but in the love and mercy of our Heavenly Father, who sent his Son to be our Saviour, that henceforth we might live in Him, having been created anew in His image." Much more conversation of a similar character fol- lowed. When Mrs. Robbins rose to go, Mrs. Leslie asked her'if she had ever been baptized. "No, Miss Leslie, must I come for'ard in the meet- in-house to be baptized?" Mr. Barton prefers always that the rite should be administered there, although he is willing to do it in private. The house consecrated to the worship of God and the religion of his Son, he considers the most proper place for whatever acts of discipleship  ,                -   "8      STEP BY STEP ---OR, that religion enjoins. I hope you will not have seri. ous objections to going to church, or feel that the cross is greater than you can take up." "Oh! I'm willin to do anything, I'm sure, you and Mr. Barton thinks best, only it seems queer like for a big woman like me to come along with babies and little children." "It will not be so, Mrs. Robbins. Young Mr.  Clark is to be baptized at the same time, and also, I understand, Mrs. Marsh, as well as her children." "Well, good bye, Miss Leslie; I owe more to you, than I can ever pay; but I'll try and be a better woman hereafter, and a good Christian, and that'll be your best reward. All the poor and the sick and ] the miserble bless you, Miss Leslie, if that's any comfort to you, and it ought to be now you're feeble yourself. I was a little girl when you come 'mongst us a sweet young bride, and I shall never forget the pleasant smile you gave me comin out of church, when I picked up your hankcher and gin it to you."  Mrs. Leslie smiled faintly and said: And I re- member you, Mrs. Robbins, a pretty rosy cheeked,  bright-eyed girl. Your little James is very like what you were then. You will try to keep him and his brother in the strait path now, I hope; good bye." In a darkened chamber, Mrs. Leslie lay on her bed with her family around her. The operation had been performed, and successfully; but it was doubtful, whether she had strength to rally from its effects. She had prepared herself for her hour of peril with her usual calm serenity of unwavering faith, and had lain down upon the bed, from which she might never   rise, with a cheerfulness, which told of her happy frame of mind. Of the immediate pain she had known nothing, having been under the influence of ether, but now that its stupefying effects had worn off, and she had returned to consciousness, she wished to have all the family assembled in her room. At first the Doctor remonstrated, but she said with a sweet smile: "You can trust me, my friend;" upon this he yielded, saying: "I can trust you, but there is not one woman in fifty, whom I should be willing to trust in a time like this." When the family were all gathered together, Mr. Leslie, in a voice, whose deep tones indicated the intensity of his feelings offered a few words of grate-  ful prayer to Him, who had mercifully sustained them in the past hour of anxiety. Then Mrs. Leslie called those present one by one to her bedside and embraced them. "I shall sleep now," were the only words she uttered, and she was left alone with her  husband. After they had gone, she said: "It may be, that I have sepn them for the last time. Pray that I may recover, if it be God's will. Nevertheless I am ready and willing to go, if He so ordains. Oh, William, how blessed it is to feel that there is One who orders for us life or death as in His infinite wisdom He sees best. We ourselves can never tell what is for our  good." In a few moments she was in a quiet sleep, her husband's hand closely clasped in hers. When the doctor came in, an hour later, and found her still asleep, he looked relieved, and said everything was going on well. The family all knew her critical state, Du"' vrr )Cllr     -   420      STEP BY STEP,---OR, and there was almost perfect stillness throughout the house. Her affectionate look and kind embrace had deeply touched them all. Its effect was far more pow- erful than words could have been. Her whole life had been a lesson to them, that rendered parting words unnecessary, even if this was her last meet- ing with them on earth.   DELIA ARLINGTON.       421       CHAPTER      XVII. "----- - let terror strike slaves mute, Much danger makes great hearts most resolute." "The queenly ship! - brave hearts had striven, And true ones died with her." MRS. HEMANS. Mns. LESLIE remained for a long time in a very precarious state, - extreme exhaustion and feebleness following as a natural result the great effort she had made for so many months to rise superior to her suf- ferings. But the doctor said he saw no reason why she should not eventually recover, and have. better health than had been hers for several years previous. She required, however, he said, the utmost care and attention.   Delia proved herself a most efficient helper at this time,-the little pet Fairy Em was very good, and apparently understanding how it was, when told her mamma was too sick to see her much, clung to her cousin with all a child's loving fondness; seeming to know intuitively where to place her innocent affec- tions. Owing to the state of Mrs. Leslie's health, Delia did not return to school, but pursued her  studies at home under her Uncle Howard's supervis-  ion, and thus was able to devote the more time to her aunt arid Duncan. Fortunately, the latter's health was better than usual at the time of his mother's greatest danger; so she was spared anxiety on his account. Aunt Charlotte was so much changed, that she was    -Inr T X 0X VT)  - Vn7[ now a welcome visitor in either invalid's room. She, however, took upon herself more particularly the su- pervision of the household and the servants, and the amusement of Harry and the twins, leaving Delia free to devote herself to her aunt, Duncan and Fairy Em. The time had now come when Mr. Howard was' obliged to-return to Buffalo. He deemed it best that Delia should pursue her studies at home for the pres- ent, and Mr. Barton kindly offered any assistance he could render her. Thus matters were arranged for the present. Mrs. Leslie would not allow her niece to give up her accustomed out-door exercise on her account; indeed, it was quite unnecessary that she should, as she had a faithful and experienced nurse,- so Delia was in the habit of walking in the morning and riding in the afternoon. As Howard had gone into the city with his father, and was often kept there till evening, her rides were for the most part solitary; but as her horse was well trained and gentle, and she was a skilful horse-woman, and the roads were safe, her uncle and aunt had no fears in allowing her to go unattended. One afternoon, Howard having come from the city earlier than usual, her aunt proposed to her to ride with him to a remote part of the town, on an errand for herself. They set off together in high spirits, gaily chatting at first as they rode along; but their conversation became more serious, as they reviewed together the scenes and events of the past year. Their errand accomplished, they turned their horses homeward. As they approached the little wood, which was at all   -DELIA ARLINGTON.      423 seasons a favorite walk or ride with Delia, she recol- lecting a message her aunt wished her to deliver to Nurse Truman, who lived near by, said to Howard: "I will go to Nurse Truman's while you stop and gather some of those maple leaves for our book; they are in perfection now, and it's such a chance to catch you these days for any little job; but be careful of your horse, for you know he doesn't fancy the steam whistle, and the cars will soon be along." "I obey your high behests, most considerate of sis- ters, but look out for your own Rosinante, lady fair." "Oh, he's a model horse, stands fire ,of all sorts, and was never known to be frightened, so I'm safe, you may be certain; au revoir," and kissing her hand away she cantered in high glee. Howard watched her till out of sight, then dis- mounting, he tied his horse to a tree and began to collect the leaves, which were now brilliant and gor- geous in their many-tinted colorings. Meantime, Delia delivered her message without alighting, and was just riding off to rejoin Howard, when Mrs. Truman begged her to delay a moment, and take a beautiful rose she had in bloom to Mrs. Leslie,- "not but she's prettier at homlle," she said," I dare say, Miss, but may-be she'll be pleased with the thought of it." As Delia stooped to take the rose, she let her bridle reins fall from her hand. At that moment a troop of noisy boys came dashing by with a shout and hallo, following the rapid progress of a kite one of the num- ber was flying. The string caught in a tree, and the kite came down just before her horse, which imme- diately sprang forward in terror, and in so doing threw the reins over his head. Off he started with a   424      STEP BY STEP,-OR,' speed fearful to behold, Delia keeping her saddle and holding on by the mane of the frightened animal. Mrs. Truman wrung her hands and cried, "Oh, dear, oh, dear, she'll be killed for sartin;" and the boys shouted "stop him, stop him;" but above all rose the clatter of the terrified creature's feet, as he almost flew over the hard road, goaded on by fear, as no whip or spur could have urged him. Delia's heart beat fast, but being naturally courageous she felt little or no alarm till the horse took the road through the wood, which lay directly across the railroad track. There was a mere chance that the cars might pass before she reached the crossing, as even now the whistle sounded shrill and fearful, like the doom of death to the almost hopeless girl. On dashed her horse and on rushed the cars, as if in hot contention for the destruction which seemed to be impending over her. "And is there no help," she :cried in the agony of supplication. Still she clung to her horse, aware that it would be almost instant and inevitable death to attempt to throw herself from him. ' On, on, and in a second or two more all would have been over with horse. and rider, when on a slight rising in the road, Delia felt that a strong hand bad seized her horse by the flying reins, and a strong arm - was encircling her waist just as the captured animal i seemed to be thrust out from under her. She knew nothing more until she found herself beside a little brook, Howard rubbing her hands and forehead, and a stranger a few paces off, looking kindly and anxiously on. "Thank God, Leslie, she's-recovering her conscious- ness," were Howard's first words. "I never knew her to faint before, and I feared she had received some injury which we had not discovered.".   DELIA ARLINGTON.      425 ("Oh, Howard," asked the trembling girl, ':how have I escaped? Whose hand was it that held that furious horse so firmly? What peril I have been in." "iDo not be terrified now, Delia. You are safe. Leslie -" "Leslie!" said Delia, looking up with astonish- ment. "Yes, Delia, Leslie, I told you so;- I always said he would come back to us; I never could give him up, and now he has returned once more, having es- caped fire and water just in time to rescue you from certain death.- Can you walk to the little cottage, Delia, at the entrance of the wood? I will leave Leslie there with you, while I go to tell the joyful tidings of his return and your providential escape. Oh, Delia, I heard your horse's feet flying past the wood where I was, and I rushed out only in time to see you dashing on to inevitable destruction as I sup- posed, when Leslie darted up, as it seemed out of the earth" and saved you. I knew it was he the moment I saw him, by the way his manly grasp held that foaming steed. We can't spare him yet, for there's many another deed of daring for him to do before he shall fall upon the land or be foundered at sea. Truly, God has been merciful to us;" and manly tears of heartfelt gratitude glistened in Howard's eyes as he spoke. ' How, Les -- Mr. Norton," asked Delia, more composed, "did you stop the horse? It seemed to me that no earthly power could hold him in his madness." "I am Leslie or Les to all the household at Wal- nut Hill, Miss Delia; if any one there calls me by my wandering name, I shall not feel quite at home. 36*   426      STEP BY STEP,-- OR,          To answer your question, a good Providence led me to sit down on that flat stone, near the crossing to rest, in memory of I Auld Lang Syne ' perhaps, or rather I should say for a purpose, which Infinite Wis. dom has fulfilled, for I was not' fatigued. I had left the omnibus below the hill, hoping I might meet some member of the family, who would announce my return to my mother, and intending, if I did not, to stop at Doctor Morton's, and request him to do it. There is a slight rising in the road just this side the crossing; at that your horse slackened his speed a very little, just enough to enable a strong arm and a resolute will, both of which you know I have, How- ard, to turn him from his course. Immediately Howard came up and soothed him by his caresses and kind words."  They had now reached the cottage, and Howard, leaving Delia and Leslie there till the former had more fully recovered from her fright, rode off to bear the joyful news to the family. He met his father at the door, and left it to him to break the tidings to his aunt and mother, and returned to meet his cousins. They were on their way home, leading the still frightened horse.  Mr. Leslie met them at the door, and warmly grasping the hand of his nephew, exclaimned, with tears in his eyes, "Thank God, Leslie, you are re- stored to us again," and led him to his mother's room and left him with her. Who shall attempt to describe the meeting between mother and son?         When he came from her with evident traces of tears on his noble countenance, he was received by all with that deep, still joy, which is the most natural   DELIA ARLINGTON.      427 form of feeling at the return of one supposed to be lost forever to his friends, with the exception of Harry, whose boisterous delight filled the whole house with an uproar, which perhaps was best calcu- lated to relieve the excess of feeling with which every heart was beating. The account which Leslie gave to the inquiries of his rejoicing friends, was in substance as follows: "- We had accomplished about two thirds of our homeward passage. One night, as we were sailing merrily along, all our canvas set, with a stiff breeze just abaft our starboard beam, we were congratulating ourselves that our voyage thus far had been so pros- perous, and were indulging in fond anticipations of a speedy meeting with our friends at home, an old sailor, who was always croaking about something, and who had predicted death individually or ship- wreck generally, for us a score of times already since we weighed anchor at Macao, cried out, 'Not quite so fast, my lads; there's many a slip between the cup 9 and the lip. My mind misgives me, there's trouble ahead and no mistake, and I shouldn't wonder if it comes afore morning!' ' Cease your everlasting croaking, Jim Benson,' cried the second mate angrily, 'you're forever predicting evil; time enough when it comes, say I.' Jim muttered an angry reply, but went off to attend to some duty, and we were soon fast asleep in our berths.  ( About one o'clock I started up suddenly; was at once as wide awake as if I had never known what sleep was, -The cabin was all a blaze of light, and hoarse voices and heavy steps were heard above me, and the cry of ' Fire,-fire,' burst upon my ears with fearful distinctness. There was a delicate young i   4zo      STEP BY ST'UP-UKORI woman on board, returning to her friends in Boston. , She went out to Canton a few years previous as companion with a lady from this vicinity, but her health failing, she was now on her way back to her friends. I had been interested in her on account of her loneliness, - for she had never seen a person on board until she commenced her voyage,- and drawn to her by her modesty, and simplicity of character. When the cry of fire was raised, she rushed out of her state-room, her face as pale as her long white night dress, exclaiming, ' My God! I -shall never see my poor old mother again.' I went to her, and did what I could to reassure her, and promised that I would save her, if it was a possible thing. "This all took place in a much shorter time than I have occupied in the narration. Meantime boats were lowered, for the flames were gaining on us rap-  idly, and all chance of saving the ship-was gone,-- and the sailors rushed into them with a recklessness and disregard of orders, which brought them to almost immediate destruction. "Oh, the horrors of that terrible night, and the heart-rending cries of those panic-stricken men, I shall never forget. Brave and daring as sailors are in facing the danger of storm or shipwreck, they have no courage to battle with fire at sea. The captain, first mate, two men, and the young lady, whom I held by the hand, with myself, were the last to leave the vessel. There was left for us only the jolly-boat, and it seemed almost tempting Providence to in- trust ourselves to that in such a sea as was surging around us. It was our only hope, however, and we  succeeded in launching and getting into it with safety. Thus six of us were embarked upon the ,    ,    t   DELIA ARLINGTON*      429 broad ocean hundreds of miles from land; all our provisions consisting of a few pounds of sea-bread, which the captain happened to have in his state-room; and almost certain death before us. Why we were, not engulfed by the mountain waves, which seemed to roll higher and higher until morning, with no light save that of our burning ship, and the stars which gleamed pale above us, He alone knows who bhath' measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, but so it was. "Morning dawned clear and bright upon us, alon6 on that vast expanse of water, for only one of the other boats got off, and we had lost sight of that during the night. The wind, however, had subsided, and for the present we were comparatively out of danger; but the question was, how we should be able to survive any- considerable time without water, and almost without food. The nearest land, according to our reckoning, was St. Helena, and that was more than two hundred miles distant. Although we were in the track of homeward bound vessels, the chance, we felt, was very slight indeed, that we should be seen and picked up.  "With the exception of one sailor we were all Christians, and we all knew in whom we trusted, and that we should be saved if divine wisdom so ordain- ed; and there went up from that little boat- fervent prayers and songs of praise, and there was peace in our hearts. The young delicate girl with us, although weak in body, was strong in that strength which cometh down from  heaven. Her sweet voice min- gled so softly and trustingly with our rougher ones in the hymns we sang with the subdued rolling of the waves around us, and the clear blue sky over our ,   430      STEP BY STEP,-- OR heads, that we all felt the cheering influence of her presence. "Oh,'- he continued after a short pause in his nar- ration, at the same time raising his eyes to heaven,- "I never before in my life knew how much strength and aid God vouchsafes to those, who, in the sincerity of their hearts, make Him their trust and hope. There was not a face in our little bark which did not wear an expression of holy calmness and confiding peace. It was because we gave ourselves up with entire faith into the hands of our Heavenly Father in the feeling, that there was wisdom and love in all His Providence. Thus we passed the day, and another night without anything of particular moment occurring. On the second morning we saw in the distance, as a dark spot upon the water, what the captain at once pronounced a sail. We waited and watched with straining eyes for some time before we could determine whether it was coming towards us, or moving away, for the wind was light. But as we continued to gaze it grew larger, until finally we were able to see that it was a bark, whose course would bring her very near us. We took Miss Har- ris's red shawl from her shoulders and fastened it to an oar, and raised it to attract the attention of those on board. In a short time it was evident we were seen. "We were taken on board this vessel, which proved to be an English bark bound to Cape Town, Africa. Our voyage thither was prosperous, as was also our return to England. After our arrival at Liverpool, the first steamer to Boston found us, witl one exception, on our way home. "All she had suffered," he continued scarcely able   to control his feelings, "was too much for the failing health and strength of Miss Harris, she died on the passage from Cape Town to Liverpool, and we committed her body to the deep. She failed rapidly after our arrival at that port, and I thought we should bury her there. Just before we sailed, however, she rallied, and almost began to hope that she should see home once more, but we had scarcely got to sea, be- fore her disease took an unfavorable turn. Her death was peaceful and happy. She left many messages and commissions with me for her poor mother, whose main dependence she was, again to see whom was the only desire relating to this world, strong in death. The sailor in our boat, of whom I have once spoken, and who had been noted for his profanity and vicious habits, gives evidence now of being a sober, Christian man. Such was the case up to the time of our arrival in Boston this afternoon. He dates his conversion from that day on the ocean." ' And the-rest of the ship's crew?" asked Howard. "The boat that got away may have been picked up, or possibly by some wonderful Providence may have got into St. Helena, but nothing to my knowl- edge has been heard of them. The rest found their ocean graves on that fearful night." "How did the fire originate?  "'It is not known. It was first discovered between decks, and had undoubte dly been burning some time, for it had made such rapid progress, when the cry was raised, that there was no time or opportunity for inquiries. You can have no idea how appalling a fire at sea is. As the flames rose and spread, licking up and devouring everything before them, I looked on in amazement and awe, and I scarcely wondered   432      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, then, that ignorance and superstition have made a god of this fearful element. Never to my dying day shall I forget that night and its scene of horrors, nor the day and night that followed,-- God is good and merciful, and with him all things are possible."' "Amen, my son," said Mrs. Norton. "He has been good and merciful to me. He has changed this heart of mine, and now, my boy, I ask your forgive- ness for the past?" "Oh, mother, do not speak so. What can you mean?" "I mean this, Leslie; I have striven to conceal from you from your childhood, the love I bear you, what has ever been the deepest feeling of my heart; I have been rebellious and complaining, and I knew it not, until the, conviction that I had lost you, and should never have an opportunity on earth to tell you how deeply and ardently I had loved you spite of. my apparent harshness, opened my -eyes to my true character. As I have sinned before all this house- hold, so before them all I make this acknowledg- ment, and declare my intention to do differently for the future. Very dear you ever were to me, my son, and very dear you ever will be; you must never doubt it again." "I never did doubt it, mother; I always knew youL loved me, and God knows how sincerely and devot- edly I have loved you in return."   DELIA ARLINGTON.       433 CHAPTER      XVIII. a Thou hast a choice; to choose is to create; Remember whose the sacred lips that tell, Angels approve thee when thy choice is well; Use well the freedom which thy Master gave." O. W. HOLMES. EVENTS of deep moment to Delia were rapidly fol- lowing each other this season. That Leslie Norton's return should have been signalized by what she could regard no otherwise than the preservation of her life, seemed as providential as it was unlooked for. Had she escaped a terrible death by coming in contact with the cars, she was sensible her strength would soon have failed her, and she would have been dashed to the ground long before her horse had recovered from his terror. Now the time had arrived when she must decide on her future home, and the first Sunday in October, she and Duncan were to unite with the Church of Christ. With regard to her place of residence, her uncle, whose counsel she had asked, and who was also authorized by her father to advise without at- tempting to control her, told her, that in his opinion, there was no conflict in her case between duty, and what he knew was her inclination. "Here, my child," he said, " is a sphere of active usefulness open before you. Your aunt will be several months in recovering her health, if indeed si6; is able to withstand the severity of the winter; Dtlri- can is a confirmed invalid for life; in attentions to them you will find as much as it will be possible for 37   434     -STEP BY STEP,-OR, ) you to do in the little leisure you will have from your studies. In New York you will find yourself very differently situated; you would not be necessary to your aunt and cousins there as you are here, and it is very doubtful in my mind whether you would be able to have any influence for good on them, as that seems to be the chief consideration with you, or whether your presence would not be actually injuri  ous to Judge Grafton in his present morbid state of , mind, associated as you would be with recollections of his son. If the New York family were in adversi- ty or trouble, I might advise you to go to them, bt  under the circumstances of the case, I do not thinlk it would be for your good or theirs to do so. You are under the best of influences where you now 'are) and are enjoying good opportunities to fit you for the duties and responsibilities of life, which will be laid upon you as they are upon others. Your father, whose leading idea ever was, that true happiness and usefulness in this world can only be foundin that golden mean which embraces the good, and avoids the evils, of the extremes of splendor and poverty, wduld have chosen, I am quite certain, as circum- stances are, for you to remain here, if you can do so consistently both with your wishes and your duty. The worldly inducements your Aunt Grafton has from time to time held out in her letters, I am well aware do not weigh a single feather with you, but at the same time, young as you are, and unformed as your character still is, you might be influenced insen- sibly by the habits and customs of those around you; not," he added, seeing she was about to reply indig- nanty to such a supposition, " that I fear for you the lift?0f a gay girl of fashion, but as all of us, the   DELIA ARLINGTON.      435 wisest and best, are not free from the temptations at- tending a' life' of luxurious ease, why should you expect to be exempt? If you daily breathe an at- mosphere of idleness and frivolity, what reason have you to suppose you-shall escape infection? "To my mind, Delia, the question presents itself in this wise. On the one hand, here, as a member of your Aunt Leslie's family, you are surrounded by the best of influences, and have before you the noblest examples of the Christian character, and a sphere of life in which, without mingling in fashionable society, you get the advantages of refined and intellectual associates, and an opportunity to employ the talents God has given you, and the wealth he has committed - ' to your stewardship in His service, and in the plain path of. duty. On the other- hand, should you go to  New York, there is the doubtful good you might do in a family nurtured in luxury and devoted to the world, with the exception at the present time of Judge Grafton himself, whose very asceticism renders it very uncertain if he would listen to your milder and more serious views of Christian truth and duty, even should you give him an opportunity. The time may conime when it will be advisable for you to spend some time with your aunt in New York, which you   ? can do, and still make your present, your permanent home." Mr. Howard would not have deemed it right to   . advise Delia so strongly as he did, had he not fancied that she was taking almost a morbid view of the sub- ject, and that the more her inclinations led her to re- main where she was, the more she feared to yield to them; besides her uncle knew, that, say what he might, she possessed, young as she was, sufficient :,^   430      STEP BY STEP,-- OR, independence of character to do whatever her con. science decided was right. His aim was, simply to place facts before her, so that she might not act mistakenly, and at the same time conscientiously. After her conversation with her uncle, which oc- curred the day previous to his departure for Buffalo, Delia pondered the subject a number of days before coming to a decision; but as soon as this was done, she lost no time in communicating it to him. In reply, she received, of course, his approval. He in. formed her, moreover, that he had been so pleasantly impressed by the life at Walnut Hill, that he had determined to leave Buffalo the ensuing spring, and settle somewhere in the neighborhood of his sister. He informed her, likewise, of the death of her old nurse, whose last inquiry was for her darling. "If there is anything you wish me to do, Delia," he wrote, " any one you wish me to provide for before  I leave Buffalo, you will tell me. Your furniture is  still stored, and can be sent to you whenever you wish it. Although you are not to come into full possession of your property until you are twenty-one, yet I have discretionary power to increase your allowance every year, if I think you are making a judicious use of it. Thus you will -be able to carry out any favorite scheme or charity. "Oh, my child, how I rejoice that you, whom I have loved next to her who was and is the guiding star of my life, have at last arrived at those clear convictions of truth and duty, and those positive religious views, which enable you to consecrate your- self to the holy purpose of living for life's great end, and not merely for pleasure or self-gratification. As exemplified hi the character of your Aunt Mary, no   less than in Mrs. Temple, you have seen that the only way to find happiness is in heeding, first of all, the requirements of duty. I never feared that you would become a vain and frivolous character, but greatly did I fear, at one time, that you might grow up a proud, self-confiding girl, making your own fallible judgment your rule of action, rather than the wisdom which is ' from above.' How I rejoice that you have chosen the right path, and I adjure you, my darling girl to follow whithersoever it leads, without turning to the right hand or the left, undismayed if it sometimes appear rough and perilous; for I can assure you that it, and it alone, is the way to heaven, where are joys beyond what mortal thought has ever imagined." It was now the last week in September, and as the family at Walnut Hill, one evening, were all gathered together in Mrs. Leslie's room, Delia said, without preamble or preface: "Aunt Mary, I have come to a decision; it is a little sooner than was necessary, perhaps. but I wished to feel more settled and undisturbed than I could do while the subject was under consideration. If you and Uncle William and my cousins like it, I wil make my home with you." "Hurra! hurra!" shouted Harry. "You are the Cousin Delia for me; I'm so glad." "Oh, isn't it good ? " exclaimed the twins. Howard's kindling eye and      glowing face told the joy he would not express until his father and mother had spoken. "Welcome to our hearts and home, Delia , said her uncle; "I cannot tell you how much I rejoice in   your decision. Your aunt will now feel that she has really an elder daughter." "Yes, my dear girl," said Mrs. Leslie, drawing Delia towards her, and kissing her fondly, "I would not urge or ask you to remain with us, but I am only too glad you are to do so." "What a happy family we shall be," said Howard, unable to wait any longer; "sister Delia now actually one of us, not a gay will-o'-the-wisp we feared would fly off, and leave her humble servants in darkness again, but an absolute fixture at Walnut Hill, and Leslie returned to be an elder brother again, mother and Duncan recovering, partially at least, their health again, and all the rest, from Algernon Sidney Leslie, the grave and proper; Harry Hotspur,-I beg his pardon, - brave Harry Percy; the brothers Cheeryble, and our fairy pet, Emily, not' omitting your most obedient, in good state and condition. Indeed, as Shakespeare has it: 'My soul hath her content so absolute, That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.'" All laughed at Howard's characteristic speech,- which had the very good effect of relieving the emo- tion which Delia felt upon announcing her choice. The younger children now crowded around her, and she felt that she was no longer homeless and friend- less, but alike in friends and a home, - these most to be prized of earthly possessions, - rich as heart could desire. After Mrs. Norton had kindly expressed her pleas- ure that she was to remain with them, Leslie came to her and said:     "If I am the elder brother, Delia, and you the elder sister of this household, 'why, it follows,' as Howard would say, 'as night the day,' that you and I are sister and brother; does it not?" Delia looked up and encountered the deep, full gaze of eyes whose light shone down upon her, as from some purer region than that of earth, and she felt to be claimed by such a man as a sister was a privilege indeed; but she answered simply: "If you desire it, I will be your sister, too." "Then give me your hand upon it, Sister Delia, and remember that henceforth you have all a sister's claims upon me." So saying, he returned to his mother's side. The heart of the young girl beat with emotions of gratitude and happiness at the evident gratification with which her decision had been received by all her aunt's family; and she was far from insensible to the interest Leslie Norton had manifested in her since his return; an interest doubtless increased on his part by her peculiar, and, in some respects, trying situation. There are few young girls, probably, of a character similar to Delia's, who have not some ideal of manly worth and excellence, which they look up to and reverence with a purity of feeling, and an intensity of devotion, corresponding to their enthusiastic dis- positions. This sentiment seems to be inherent in their natures, and is a holier, because a less selfish one, than that of love, to which in later years it gives place. To Delia, Leslie Norton was the realization of this ideal of excellence and nobleness; hence the heart-felt pleasure with which she received the assur- ances of his interest, in his kind words and the still kinder glance of his clear dark grey eyes.   "O      STEP BY STEP,-- 1R1 J For a few moments Delia sat musing, not un- watched by Howard, who noticed how she started and blushed at the entrance of Melville Temple. Presently he crossed over to her and said, so as not to be heard by the rest of the company: "Confess, sister mine, that you were just now con- trasting in your mind Les and Melville, and not much to the advantage of the latter." "How did you guess?" "By your tell-tale phiz, lady fair." "Well, what then?" "Oh, nothing; just nothing at all," he answered carelessly, and moved off. The vacant chair was soon filled-by Melville, whose opinion of Delia had, of late, undergone a great change; while she, although she could now talk freely and easily with him, had never, if truth must be told, overcome her first impressions of the " paragon.'"To him, the greatest charm in her character was an unconsciousness of her own personal attractions, and an entire freedom from any attempts to gain the notice of gentlemen, as gentlemen. "It is evident enough," he said to himself, "she has not, like most girls of her age, begun to think of love and matrimony. I wonder how I could have been so deceived about her." And he was right; for although there beat in Delia's bosom a heart as susceptible to the God-given emo- tion of pure, ardent love, as was ever enshrined in mortal frame, and which, in its own good time, would be ready to respond to sincere affection, she was neither by education nor temperament, disposed to regard a good match or a good establishment, as the chief aim and purpose of life to a young lady. "To   DELIA ARLINGTON.       44 everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven;" and to her the present was emphatically the time of preparation for the future, wisely leaving the manner of that future to Him who ordains all human events.                       .   "2      STEP BY STEP,- OR, CHAPTER XIX.  Hail, then, hail to you all! To the kingdom of heaven be ye wel- come. Children no more from this, day; but by covenant brothers and sisters." LONGFELLOW. THE first Sunday in October was one of those mild, lovely days so common in autumn, as if nature strove in this way to make some compensation, in anticipation, for the dull, chill, and cloudy season so soon to follow. The rich haze of that uncertain season, the Indian Summer, fell upon the landscape, glorious in its brilliant robes of autumnal splendor. Meet time and scene it was for the offering in bap- tism and admission to the table of the Lord, of those who this day were to set themselves, or their children, apart to the service of the Most High. Delia had risen early that morning. She regarded the act of consecration, by which she was to signify and avow her discipleship to Jesus Christ the Saviour, as the most important event of her life, indeed, as the great era of her life-history. Other periods and other acts might be of great moment to her, in whatsoever related to her well being; but nothing, she felt, would so powerfully affect her, both for time and eternity, as what, that day, she was about to do and become. In infancy she had been dedicated by the sprinkling of the waters of baptism, to the service of her God; and now, she herself, by her own voluntary act, was to confirm the promises then made by her parents. '   DELIA ARLINGTON.      443 It is not to be supposed that she had no doubts or misgivings with respect to her worthiness. - It becomes us all, frail and imperfect as we are, to approach in humility and self-distrust, the table spread in commemoration of Him " who spake as never man spake," and whose " kingdom  is not of this world;" and, with the emblems of his broken   and bleeding body. No one, with just views of its significance and purposes, of what it is and what it is capable of being to believing souls, hungering  and thirsting after righteousness, what it is by virtue of His presence by whose name it is called, will dare to do it in a self-confident or a self-righteous spirit. They are those who are conscious of weak- ness and desire to be made strong, with the strength that cometh down from heaven; who feel that they are sinners, and desire to be renewed in the spirit of their minds; to whom the Lord's Supper is designed and fitted to be an agency of divine grace. "Come unto me," said the Saviour, " all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give yoiu rest; " and are not all they weary and heavy laden, however gay and happy they may appear to be, who have not taken upon them that yoke and that burden, which the Master himself declared to be easy and light? Delia, young as she was, and favored as she had been by fortune, had yet lived long enough to know the weariness and burden of an unsanctified spirit and doubting heart, and she felt to cast off the one and assume the other, would be to her the balm in Gilead which she needed. When she joined the family at breakfast, her face was bright and serene, as if she had been entertaining angels. The two young candidates for admission to all the   "4      STEP BY STEP-- OR, privileges of the visible Church of Christ, preparatory to setting out for the house of God, came and stood by Mrs. Leslie's couch to receive her kiss and bene-.  diction. Kissing her niece fondly, she said: "God bless you, my child; may this act of your early youth be well pleasing in His sight, and may it be to you, all it has been to me. If God be for us, who can be against us? If we acknowledge Him, He will acknowledge us." Duncan sat down by his mother, and laying his head, beautiful in its rich curls, upon her hand, said: "Mother, I feel so happy now, I could willingly go home. Surely those who seek not to obey the commandments of the Lord know not the joy of His presence." "Seeing, they will not see, neither hearing, will they understand,' my child," answered his mother; and then offered a prayer for her stricken son, that he might ever be kept in the paths of holiness and peace. At church after the usual exercises, the services of the occasion proceeded, first with the baptism. When Mr. Barton, in a distinct and serious tone of voice, requested the candidates for that rite to ap- proach the altar, a perfect stillness pervaded the church, broken at short pauses by the feeble cry of an infant. There was an unusual number to be baptized, and as they presented themselves, all in the house were moved, some even to tears. First came mothers with innocent, unconscious infancy in their arms; then followed Mrs. Marsh with her chil- dren; then young Mr. Clark, who in the fresh vigor of early manhood, had come forward to confess and seal his discipleship to Christ the Saviour; then a   DELIA ARLINGTON.      445 young girl whom sore afflictions had first led to the serious consideration of her Christian duties and obliga- tions; and last of all, Mrs. Robbins, who came trem- blingly forward, as if fearing lest some one should cry out, "Stand back; profane not the altar of the Lord." And as the waters of baptism, which to her were, in an especial manner, significant of that inward cleans- ing from sin and pollution, which " is the answer of a good conscience toward God," touched her prematurely wrinkled brow, she sobbed aloud; but soon controlling herself, she stood leaning on her cane, her face covered by her hand, during the prayer that followed, in which the pastor feelingly invoked the divine blessing alike on the young lambs of the fold of the Good Shep- herd; on those who had come in early youth; on her who had come in mature womanhood, bringing her little ones with her; and on her who had come through a dark and sorrowful experience, to Him who is able to save to the uttermost all who call upon His  X name.  One little cherub of six months, Mrs. Marsh's youngest child, when the water -touched her forehead, and Mr. Barton was saying, "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," looked up in his face and smiled a smile so sweet and seraphic, that it seemed naught impure or unholy could ever stain a form wherein was enshrined such a spirit. And God ordained that sin should never dwell in that young heart, for ere another Sabbath dawned He took her to Himself; and the mother's consolation was, "'I offered her to the Lord, and He accepted the offering and took her home." To the communion of the supper, which immedi- 88   "t      STEP BY STEP,--OR, ately followed the baptism, were admitted as mem- bers in the church of Christ, Duncan, holy and peaceful in his faith and resignation; Delia, in the enthusiastic ardor of a young, vigorous nature; the young man and the young woman, who laid thus early all their hopes and talents on the altar of the Lord; Mrs. Marsh, who, in the maturity of woman- hood, had learned that life, without the experiences and supports and teachings of religion, was a sad and weary and perplexing pilgrimage, leading none knew whither; and Mrs. Robbins, once sin and sorrow- stricken, but now repentant and hopeful. It was indeed the table of the Lord, at which they all sat down together, regardless of the distinctions, which prevail elsewhere, being one body, having "One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all," "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner- stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord." At the conclusion of the service, as Mrs. Robbins, who had been deeply affected by all that had taken place, was moving towards the door with a bowed head, she felt a light touch on her shoulder; and look- ing, saw Delia at her side. "Oh, Miss," she said, " this has been a blessed day. I cried twice; I couldn't help it, once for my sins, and once for joy, that I had been forgiven. I knowed I was forgiven, for I felt I was, as soon as I was baptized, and our minister prayed so earnestlyfor ' 'me; it seemed jest as if Christ said so to me, as he -did to thewoman we read about in the Testament." "Yes, Mrs. Robbins," answered Delia, "'we will never forget-this day; and now you must let-me be a friend to you always."   - i^ljlA ARKLINGaTON.     447 It was with deep content and sweet peace that Delia pursued her way homeward. Nature seemed to be in harmony with the holy calm of her feelings, so still and beautiful was every thing around her. As she looked up at the brilliant foliage of the trees by the road-side, or abroad upon the meadows so green and glistening, her heart swelled within her at the thought of the goodness and love of Him who has made everything beautiful in its season, and who has given to decaying nature an aspect so cheering, and so suggestive to the mind. Truly might she have said at this time, in giving expression to her feelings: "How glorious is the hour  When first our souls awake, And through thy spirit's quickening power Of the new life partake! "With richer beauty glows The world before so fair; Her holy light religion throws, Reflected everywhere." Yes, the holy light of religion was about her path, and henceforth would be a lamp to her feet, provided she should continue faithful to her own convictions of duty and right.  But her life-journey had only been commenced in the new relations in which she now found herself; and step by step she must travel on,-on in the strait and narrow way which leadeth to everlasting life,-if she would arrive at last at the Eternal City, the New Jerusalem seen of the Apostle in a vision, which "had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof." Even there, would her journey be ended? May not the soul be infinite   "8 STEP BY STEP,- OR, DELIA ARLINGTON. in aspirations, as it is without end in being? And may not the passage from time to eternity, be but as another stage of progress? This the young disciple knew not. But one thing she did know, for Christ the Saviour had said it: "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." In the strength of this knowledge, Delia Arlington stood on the threshold of womanhood; her lofty, enthusiastic nature enkindled and sustained, and at the same time subdued, by her past experience and present faith, which had made her a new creature in Christ Jesus. THE END.
