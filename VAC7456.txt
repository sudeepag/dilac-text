Fling fir the plumb into the heaving brine! Quarter less four, we loudly hear, As the ship the dangerous coast doth near."   i EARLY at night, one day, as a pilot took his post in theBeacon look- out, at the Balize, to scan the wide waters of the Gulf southward, to see if he could dis- cover any sail re- quiring the bene- fits of his skill, he perceived a vessel in the south-east- ern board, slowly   approaching the Pass, under shortened sail. The pilot was a gray-bearded, weathen-beaten tar, who had been looking at nothing, for thirty years, but the Mexican Gulf, till he could scarce- ly see anything on land. He was a thick set, hardy-looking man, in a huge gray and brown beard, and'wore a tarpaulin that had weathered almost as many equinoctials as its owner, which was fastened to, one of the huge buttons of his dread-nought, coat' by a lamyar.   His age might have been about sixty; but he had an eye that would penetrate even a Balize fog. He prided himself on not needing a spy- glass to make out a vessel, and though it was pretty well understood among the fraternity of pilots, that he sometimes mistook a barque for a ship, and a topsail schooner for a brig, yet they indulged the old skipper in his vanity, preferring to trust to their own spy-glass, however. Old Roger now shut up his left eye till it was almost extinguished, and then half closing his right, he slightly bent his head forward to take a better look at the vessel; for he could hardly credit that a vessel would be shortening sail at this hour, on a smooth gulf, a gentle wind, and the night so near, when it was important to be within the land. "If she showed a si'nal for pilot," mumbled Roger, " vy then I woun't be surprised to see her short'n to wait for himn; but I can't see no bun- tin' flyin'; and if she, had a scrap as long as a wiper set, I'd see it with my eyes." "What is that, Uncle Roger?" asked a young pilot, his assistant, who was smoking a cigar, on a bench at the foot of the beacon. "A squar rigger, shortenin' sail, about four miles out, sou-sou-west, and no signal set 'l and the craft looks warrish, toq I I think I can see her guns!" ,    / ;,) :    "Don't you see the maker's name, too, Master Roger?" asked, in a good-natured, jeering way, a third pilot, himself past fifty, who was engaged in patching the 'sail -of a fast looking little boat that was moored near him. "That's from envy, Dunstan, man! Because I can see better at sixty than you at fifty. Take your spy-glasses! See if I am not right!" "If the vessel is shortening sail, it must be for a pilot," said the younger, going to a rack on the gallery of the hut and taking down a spy- glass. With it he mounted the winding stairs of the beacon, and reaching the elevated summit by Roger, placed the telescope to his eye. After a moment's scrutiny, he said: "You are right! I'll bet on your eyes yet, Uncle Roger. She is under reefed topsails, and is a gun brig." The other pilot now took his place on the look out, and scrutinized the advancing stranger. "It is a foreign vessel-I think a Spaniard," he said. "That is my idee," answered Roger, who was making his one eye worktso hard against two telescopes, that his cheeks were screwed up into a mass of wrinkles, and it would have required a telescope to find his left eye at all; while the place of the right was only to be detected by a little grayish glitter, like a star set beneath his overbent eyebrow. '"He is a Spanish brig of war, it is my opin- ion," said Dunstan; " and he don't mean to be in a hurry about coming in!" "It is possible he may want a pilot, and not know where we are!" said Roger. "I'll board himn, at any rate!" "Stop, Roger, that fellow looks irregular!" said Dunstan, as the old man, who limped a lit- tle with the effects of a cannon-ball" wound he had got in the British war, was hobbling' down. "He is armed, but not a regular armed vessel, that is certain! The yards are tod square for the regular service; she is too low in the water for it, and her guns are too'long. They are ndt carronades, as they ought to be, for a brig of her size; and the men are too muclftrowded on her forecastle, for a regular!" t' You. are always looking out for a wolf, Dun- stan, since you once got caught By a buccaneer, who kept. you a week in' irons. You'll never forget that!" i How did I know he was a buccaneer? It was years ago, and he made a signal for a pilot, and made me pilot up the river; in the darik tO   the estate, which they plundered. It was a seri- bus affair, and I have reason to be wary, mates! But I tell you I don't like this chap's looks!" "All war vessels of other nations are not like ours, neat as band-boxes, and ship-shape as a chronometer." ' But they all look like nationals; but that is not a national, or she'd show her colors!" "Well, I'll board her! Come, Tirrel, unmoor, and let us run out to her! We'll reach by moon up, in three-quarters of an hour, and it will be a fine night to run her in!" "You'may be sure, Master Roger, she don't want a pilot. In my opinion, she is a Cuban patriot vessel, waiting to embark or land officers!"This opinion was advanced by a fourth pilot, who met Roger at the foot of the ladder. "I have been looking at her, and it is my opinion she is a Cuban vessel, and has something to do with the expedition we hear is on foot, up in the city!" "I'll soon learn what she is," answered Roger. "If she doesn't have a pilot she'll be ashore, steering for that Pass." In five minutes more he was in his pilot boat with Tirrel, and, under a fair wind, was stretch- ing out towards the Gulf, in the direction of the suspiciously-acting vessel. The vessel, in the meanwhile, which was the subject of their speculations, stood slowly to- wards the entrance of- the south-east Pass. She was a beautifully proportioned brigantine, with an indescribably -foreign air about her, which would have distinguished her at a glance, by any one who was familiar with nautical matters, from an American. Her masts were unusually lofty and tapering, and her yards veryr square, her main and fore projecting in enormous arms on either side of her hull, and their length was in- creased by studding-sail booms. She was not exactly square-rigged, inasmuch as} her main- mast, though it bore a main-topsail and a span- ker, carried -above, instead of a topgallant:sail and royal, one triangular gaft-topsail, being a royal and topgallant-sail in one. - She lay very loose in the water, and seemed to crouch upon it like a hound,' about to spring. Her canvass was lessened in such a way, that, although she appeared to. carry all sail, each sail Was curtailed by reefing of its full, breadth and dimensions. This was evidently an art to prevent entering the river and passing the pilot stations by day-' light; a subterfuge that- awakened the attention of the pilots;, for a vessel neier carried ail:-in   this mariner, in fair weather, unless there was some covert object in view. And a covert object the brigantine, or rather those who sailed in her, had in view. Dunstan had- nearly guessed right. The vessel was a Spanish craft, and heavily armed. If we go be- fore Ol01 Roger, and reach her deck in advance of him, we shall see that the whole aspect of things on -board is decidedly foreign and Castil- ian. The very name of the brigantine, La Ger- trudis, betrayed her to be Spanish. The forty men or more that are idling, in groups, about her decks, are attired in the picturesque scarlet, or .blue and yellow conical caps of Andalusia, and their small jackets, thickly decked with braid and buttons, and slashed trowsers open to- the knee, bore the cut of the Mediterranean sail- ors. Their swarthy or rich brown faces tell of the olive fields of southern Spain. Some of the men are gathered in a group on the forecastle, looking wistfully towards the low, flat ostia of the Mississippi before them, looking more like leagues of meadow-land afloat, than solid' land. They see. the elevated beacon from which Old Roger had been surveying them, and are trying to make out what it is. One, a handsome fel- low, with an eye like Mercury, and a voice sweet as David's in his youth, is singing a Sicilian hymn for mere pastime rather than from devo- tion. Amidships, two cooks are busily employed in preparing supper, and the fragrance of coffee pervades the vessel. Near the gangway paces a man with a red sash about his waist, two orna- mented pistols stuck in it, and carrying a naked cutlass in his hand. He is a sentry. Fore and aft, on both sides of the deck are cannon mount- ed on carriages, with a pyramid of cannon balls piled up between every two. Farther aft walks up and down a tall, thin, Spanish man, with a long nose, a long telescope and a long cigar! He is, by his appearance and duties, a quarter-master. The spy-glass is sel- I dom from his eye; now sweeping the land, now 1 the sea to the south and east of him.    ( At the helm stands a thorough-looking sea- man, but whose warm, dark eye shows his Cor- x sican blood.. He is directing the course of the i vessel, in obedience to the voice of one who t stands near him, and who, from his appearance, v is the commander of the vessel. His height is I above that of ordinary men, and commanding c with more of the air of a nobleman of the Span.-  ish court, than the captain of a brig of war. His t bearing was cold and haughty; he spoke but I   few words, and these as if with an effort. Hoe was exceedingly handsome, but there was in his eye danger to him who trusted it. His dress was that of an officer when at sea, commonplace and worn; his hat even being torn, and more than one button being off his sea-coat. There was one other person, evidently below, for the fragrance of a cigar ascended from the skylight, through which was visible just a glimpse of all the appointments of a luxuriously furnish- ed cabin. But we will not, at present, go into the cabin, as our business, just now, is on the' deck. The cold and haughty-looking Spaniard, after having given an order for a man to go into the fore-chains and heave the lead, walked his deck slowly, with his hands behind him. "Quarter less. six!' sang out the leadsman, in a prolonged and musical tone.' A mere lad, with a face more like a Saxon than a native of Spain, but whose dress and arms showed him to be an officer, repeated the cry to the captain. "The water shoals!" 'responded he to the helmsman. "Art thou sure thou knowest the channel!" "Without doubt, senor capitan 1" "Go on, then! But it is at thy life's peril if :thou gettest the brig into danger." The man slightly colored and then grew pale, and listened with an anxious ear as if the words of the chief had weakened his confidence in him- self. "Half five!" sang the helmsman, as he drew in his line. The captain paused in his walk, and looked keenly ahead. Something met his eye which led him to call, in electric tones: ' Aloft, there, two or three of you, and see if that is a bar ahead I Sir hlelmsman' do you see that grayish line between us and the mouth of the Pass? Beware that we are not beached I I know nothing of this shore, and on your word that you have often been in here, I have entrust. ed her to you." "It was some years ago, senor," answered the man, with hesitation. The captain regarded his face keenly for a moment, and then approaching the companion-way, where a crescent of pistols were stuck in serried array, ready for the hand, he took one of them, examined the cap with, coolness, and then cocking it, stood by the side of the steersman. Not a word did he utter, but the other knew that if the brig struck he would be shot dead at his wheel. It would have re.   quired a man of firm nerves to have steered a, ship calmly and truly under such .circumstances, however perfect might be his knowledge of the channel. The man became deadly pale, and once looked as if he would bring the brig round and steer out into the Gulf; but he well knew that such a course would not be consented to by the captain, and that he must either safely enter the Pass, or be sacrificed. The captain seemed to read his very soul; to understand his feelings; to di- vine his thoughts; to comprehend his unfitness; yet he did not remove him, but seemed to stand waiting for the brig to miss - the entrance to the Pass, in order to delight himself in the sweet re- venge of shedding his blood. The helmsman, although he began to feel that each moment might be his last, yet did his best to keep the brigantine on her course. "Five fathoml" called out the leadsman, with an abrupt cry. Several of the men who were idling about now started up and looked ahead. "What do you make out of that streak?" call- ed the captain to one of the men who stood in the fore-topgallant cross-trees. "It seems to be a bar of sand, stretching from east to west, senor, about a league from the shore!" was the response. "And-a-ha-a-al-f four!" sang the leadsman, loud, and long. "Pedro Marcos!" impressively said the cap- tain to the steersman, " the brig draws seventeen' feet forward!" Pedro Marcos bit his nether lip till the blood sprung from it. He stretched his eyes to see if there were any sign of a deeper channel. Now he would luff a point, or a point and a half; and now he would keep away three points. Then he would come back to the middle course. Never was a helmsman in such perplexity; never one steered a ship in such mortal terror. "Four fathoms!" sang the leadsman, as he wound in his dripping lead line hand over hand.   "Four fathoms!" repeated the boyish officer to the quarterrdeck. "Four fathoms i" whispered the captain in the ear of Pedro Marcos, and smiled grimly, as if he would rather the brig should ground than he should not have the pleasure of killing the man. The brig now neared the whitish gray line, which looked precisely like a sand-bar. The captain, who was by no means indifferent to the safety of his vessel, ascended the main rigging to examine the approach to the Pass, which seemed to him to be defended by this extended beach. But in a moment or two after reach- ing the top, he saw that what seemed to hiin a field of sand a quarter of a mile distant, was un- dulating along its whole surface, like the rest of the waters of the Gulf. Calling for his glass, which the boyish. officer handed. up to him, he saw that it was a field of muddy water, which the turbid Mississippi had discharged from its mouth, and borne a league seaward. The water of the river being lighter than the water-of the Gulf, floated upon it, and refusing to mingle, offered a defined and sharp outline between the two, that looked like the edge of a sand-bank. While he was aloft the brigantine approached the floating line of fresh water, and when once her length from it, seemed to be driving right upon a muddy shore. He felt a misgiving as he saw, beneath him, the bow prepare to cleave it - but the cheering cry of the leadsman, as 'the cut- water turned up, like a ploughshare, the turbid fluid, of "Six fathoms!" which every man in the brig joyfully re-echoed, assured him. The sur- prise of the crew when they found their vessel leaving so suddenly the emerald'sea, and enter- ing upon a river of liquid mud, was variously experienced; and the apprehension with which they had watched the entrance of the vessel upon the seemingly dangerous navigation, was re- placed by admiration.   CHAPTER II. A SUMMARY DEED OF BLOOD.   "SEVEN fathoms!" called out the leadsman, in a lively tone, as the captain, after taking a sur- vey of the low, reedy shores which he was ap- proaching, descended to the deck. He saw that the natural color had come back to the cheek of the steersman, and confidence had taken the place of despair. The sun was now on the very verge of the level horizon, and the captain saw that daylight would soon disappear. The leads- man's cry suddenly startled all who were gaining confidence: "Quarter less four!" "Quarter less four!" sharply repeated the boy officer. "Dost thou hear that, Pedro?" demanded the captain. "Senor, it is twelve years since I was here, and the mouth of this river is constantly chang- ing its depth; and -- ." The man' hesitated. "And what?" coolly demanded the captain, as he took up the pistol and began playing with the trigger. "And I fear that I may not be able to find it I Look I senorj! I see a pilot boat coming out to us! Will you take a pilot and release me ." "I took thee on board off Havanal  Thou didst say that thou couldst pilot me into the Mississippi, night or day ." "  I ould have done so *nce V' ,., , ,. , .f ., , I , e ,'   "Thou' hast deceived me 1" "No, senor," answered the man, looking like a corpse, as the leadsman called, out, "Half three 1'" "Why hast thou undertaken that which thou wert not fitted for?" "Hear me, senor. I heard that my mother, aged and infirm, and whom I left wickedly years ago, is near death, in New Orleans. I learned it from a coasting shallop. The skipper ltore'me a message to her, that if I valued her forgiveness and blessing, she must see my face before she died. It was, while I was in trouble to know how I should get there, that your vessel ctame in sight, wanting a pilot. What could I do, senor capitan? Once I knew the river mouth well; but I was' not prepared to: find the channel so changed. Here, where we are, it used to, ie deepest-twenty fathom, at least-- ." "Cease I wilt thou resign the helm, and stand out there on t-he taffrail and be shot?" "O, senor!, my mother " "HistI Mind thy helm, and not be clasping thy hands 1", "O, senor mery ,There comes a pilot boati so you are piloted in, you need no more i" !, "Dost thou not. know ,I want no landsman from the shore to board, my vessel, to tetray, if he will, who X am i My qxpeditiot u pp ;,j" .J   "I know it, senor capitan, but-- ." "Three fathoms!" shouted the leadsman, with the quick note of alarm. "One foot to spare between the keel and the bottom!" hoarsely whispered the captain. Pedro Marcos cast a single glance at the face f the chief, and then quicker than thought strik- zing down the pistol, he deserted the helm and San forward like a deer among the men. The captain could not follow him, as he had to snatch the helm upon the instant, to prevent the vessel broaching to; and with admirable skill he wore round and just escaped beaching the vessel upon a bar, every one on board feeling her touch the ground as she fell off and swung again into deep water, on the opposite tack. No sooner had he succeeded in clearing her from the imminent peril than he laid the brigantine to the wind, and placing a man at the helm, he. caught up his pistol, and advancing a few paces towards the capstan, he said in a low voice that reached the most distant ear; for every man was expect- ant and silent: "Pedro Marcos I come aft, and stand and be shot!" "Mercy, senor O, do not hold me, men! Save me! I have amother who but waits to bless me! Mates and friends, do not drag me!" "Let. him alone! He shall come himself! Every order given in this brig is to be obeyed without the aid of others to enforce it. Wilt thou come aft, hombre!" "No, senor! O, no! I cannot! I will not! I don't mean to disobey--but do not command me to come there, to be shot dead the next minute! There is no priest! I have sins, brothers! I cannot die without confessing my sins! O, pity, pitypity, my poor old mother! Mercy, mercyt!" "Art thou coming?" cried the chief, in a tone of thunder, The man crgawlqd rather than walked; he stopped and grovelled, and then raised his hands and eyes imploringly; and then he came a little farther on his hands and knees; and then he lin- gered as if he would prolong his life all he could; but the steady voice of the captain drew him ir- resistibly onward; till he was within three yards of his executioner. Here he rose to his knees, and wrung his hands and bent the most heart rending looks of entreaty upon the inexorable and blood-loving man, "O, capitan! O, do not kill me 1" "Enough of this! Thus perish all who dare to deciv me e!'"   With these words the captain of the brigantine advanced the three paces that separated him from his victim. Ped o seeing that his fate was inevitable, shut his eyes and clasped his hands together upon his heart in anguish that may not be written; the living only can know it when they are placed in a like situation. The pistol was placed against his left temple, and as coolly as he would fire a ball through a plank, the cap- tain discharged the contents of the pistol into his brain. The murdered man fell forward dead, deluging the deck with the warm streams of his life blood. [SEE ENGRAVING.] Scarcely had the smoke of the pistol which had done this execution cleared away, before a loud hail was heard to windward, and the cap- tain beheld a pilot boat close aboard of him, Without waiting to have his hail answered, Old Roger, who had approached very near unnoticed during this scene, ran alongside, and lowering his sail, caught one of the steps of the gangway ladder with a short boat hook, and held his boat to the brig's side while Tirrel secured ft. The next moment the gray-haired old helmsman was standing before the captain on the 'dck:;' The san had set; but there was still almost, as much light as in full day  Roger, therefore,.started back when he beheld the body of the unskillful, steersman, and the inquiry whether they would not have a pilot, died upon his lips as he survey- ed the body aghast. "What dost thoe pale at, old man.!  Hast thou never beheld a dead man V'r "He seems Just killed'?" "Not two, minutes since! He was & traitor to his duty and to me!  I took him to pilot mee  into the river, and you see where my vessel ise and where he is ' Old Roger felt not a little uncomfortable., He saw at a glance that le liad volunteered in what he had best have let alone.. He begian, in truthr to believe Dynstan was correct, and, that he had boarded a buccaneer's vessel. "This is strange doi;'s," thought the ordi man, within himself; "it pangt be denied' the brig is in a place she ought weypf to have put her nose in; .but it seems hard to blow a poor fe^iow' brains out for missing the .chnel!" I Heflienh said aloud, and boldly: "Captain, seein' your vessel was tryin' to get into the south-east Pass, which has b een onnav- igable for five years, T thpught I'would offer you my services, as I. .. re t Aatr pot. jt; f yoau A.   please, I will bid you good night. I fear that if I should miss it, I should lay alongside of that' poor fellow! I am an old man, master, and having but little time to live, I want to make the most of it. t wish you a very ghod day!" " Dost thou know the channel well into the river?" coolly asked the captain, as if he did not hear the old man's good day. "Yes, senor, but only for honest keels!" )"You are an old man, and have license. As 1 am to go into the river, you must pilot me!" This was spoken with a decision that caused Old Roger to feel very unpleasantly, especially as he found that as he proceeded to quit the brig- antine, the officer of the gang-way stood before it with his naked cutlass. "You don't mean to make me pilot you in without my will? It is against law!" said Old jRoger. "A pilot is bound, by law, to give his aid to ,every vessel who asks it!" "True, true! But--" "Take the helm, old man, or direct he who has it how  to steer Away with this body! Pitch it over, with two twenty-eight pound shot at his heels!" Old Roger saw lhat resistance would be in vain; that he was, in fact, a prisoner; and put- ting the best face on the matter that he could, he walked aft, and telling Tirrel to take the helm, lie took commandof the vessel. The crew obey- ed his orders, and the brigantine, instead of try- i ng to enter the south-east Pass, changed her course and- steered westwardly, to make the south-west entrance, out of which the pilot boat had come. The shot being fastened in bags to the ;feet of Pedro Marcos, four men raised him and pitched him over into the sea, with a heavy plash, and all was silent! A bucket or two of water washed the blood into the lee-scuppers, and a1 trace of the murder was obliterated, save from  the book of 'the recording angel. The brig now mn along, under full canvass, sparallel with the land, Roger having had the reefs shaken out as the first of his orders. The twilight had by this time deepened into dark- ness, which was soon dissipated, however, by the ' radiance of the fall moon, which poured its vol- uame of golden light across the level ocean. The captain of the brig seeing that his vessel was under the charge of a man who would con- duct her into the river safely, now drew near 1Roger, and said: "I am fortunate, o ld man, in getting your aid. ,. f    r  I The villain who preceded you would have lost me my brig; but let him pass I He has atoned for his ignorance or treachery, I know not which it was. What light is that inland?" "It is a lantern on the lookout, sir!" "Has any vessel of war passed up to New Or- leans within. a few days?" "Three weeks ago a sloop'sailed up, senor." "Then my intelligence is true."  Here he walked up the deck once and then returned, as if he were thinking closely; as if the knowledge of the fact communicated by Roger annoyed him. Roger saw the effect it had upon him, and add- ed, as if he would increase it: "The sloop is one of the best in the service, fully armed and manned, a fast sailer, and with one of the fighting lads in command." "Indeed! She is in the city, you suppose, or is she in the river V?' "At anchor off the plaza, I hear." "Very well." Here the brig began to enter the Pass, and the attention of Roger was directed to her move- ments; for he was in great fear, lest, if by chance he should ground the brig, he would be shot. He was, therefore, very nervous until he saw the brig fairly in the river, and abeam of the look- out. He then brought her to, and said to. the captain:        (- "There is no further need of my services 1" "Is the channel in the middle, the rest of the way?" "Yes sir. I never go above this." "So, good. Now as you have done your duty so faithfully, take this gold. There are five ounces." "It is more than the charge, sir 1" "No matter, take it!" "No sir, I will take only my fee I and all over that would be thy gift, and I will not take a gift from a  man with a bloody hand!" "By the rood, old gray beard, I am half a mind that thou shalt stay on boardl A few days in irons would tame thy tongue 1" "I am an American citizen, and I fear not to speak my mind openly." "Well, go. Leave the brig forthwith 1" "With many thanks to get off with my head on my shouldegrs, p answered the perverse and stout Old. Roger, as he stepped into his boat, where Tirrel had already preceded him. The captain made no reply, but turning away gave orders to square away the yards again and   ascend the river, while the pilot boat flew to the shore. It was a beautiful night. The wind was just strong enough to take the vessel up the river, about five miles an hour. The banks on either hand looked like low green walls, between which they were sailing. The moon's brightness gave almost the clearness of noonday to the scene. Soon they lost sight of the Gulf, and then of the Balize, with its hamlet of pilots' houses, and then of the light on the lookout. All around they were land-locked, and peacefully moving on the placid bosom of the father of waters, whose storms, however, when the is around in anger, when the tornado ploughs his depths, are almost as fearful as those of the ocean. Seeing that his brig was doing well, and only required to be kept in the middle of the stream, the captain left the deck to descend to the cabin, a small, half-grown little man, by the name of Tito, who might have been Mexican or half In- dian, his servant, having called him to supper. By morning the brigantine was sixty miles from sea, and about that distance from New Or- leans. During the day she continued her course, but disguising her appearance by closing her ports, and housing her royal masts, and sending most of her men below, as they sailed in sight of plantations, and of vessels passing down. By   three hours before sunset, having sailed all day between verdant forests, wirh here and there a sugar estate to relieve the wilderness-like aspect, the brig came to the English Turn. Near here was a plantation, ornamented by a handsome villa. Here the captain anchored, and went on shore with his man Tito, whom. he sent secretly up to the city by land. After two hours' absence the captain returned from the Villa, with wlhose owner he had had some secret communication; and as the'wind was fair and fresh he made sail again, and stood up towards the city. A head wind, however, delayed them, and then a calm for two days. About the close of the third day the wind favored, and four hours' run brought them inh sight of the city, but after night had set in, and it was ten o'clock before the brig anchor- ed on the opposite shore, about a mile and a half below the grand plaza. Not ten minutes after she was safely moored, a boat left her side, containing a coxswain, four oarsmen and the -captain. it reached- the city about, eleven o'clock, and as the captain landed he was met by Tito, who, after the interchange of a few words, led him in a direction towards the heart of the city.   CHAPTER III. A GOSSIPPING CONVERSATION.   IN the most'ancient quarter of the city of New Orleans, there stands an antiquated building, which, from its size and the, Moresco style of its (ti/ecture, must have been the abode, in the d  of its earlier dignity, of an opulent and noted hidalgo, perhaps of the colonial governor himself. The house has two fronts, facing each on fre- quented thoroughfares of the city, one of which is ornamented with a projecting balcony and stained a dark buff color, while the other is of a deep gray tint, and has a large gateway, with narrow windows pierced on either side of it i and over the arch'of the gate or portecocher, are seen three smaller openings of an oval shape, which are grated with strong bars of iron, near togeth- er, and placed tranversely, as if on that floor had been, anciently, a prison; but a bird cage hang- ing in one of them showed that kthe apartments within were occupied by the famii that might at present inhabit the mansion. It is two stories in height, with a battlement running around the eaves, upon the top of which stand several gigantic vases of stone;- one or two of which are shattered, and from others grow either sturdy orange trees or long grass waving in the wind. The heavy mullions of the win. - dowS,the carved grotesque heads that ornament; te Ji   vei :the heavy doomr , dotAble .ti eeid   and studded with iron headed n'ails, all bear tes- timony to the strength and solidity of the edifice. Beside the two fronts there is an alley, narrow and dark, which runs along by the third wall of the building, leading to a court yard, enclosed by a'very high wall; the foirth side of the house forms one of the boundaries of the court. For some days prior to the opening of our story, this edifice had become an object of curiosity to the inquisitive busy bodies of the neighborhood. Hitherto, that id until it began to awaken this interest, it had been the abode of a wealthy Spaniard, from the island of Cuba, who, it was said, had been banished from that place forsome differences of political Opinion: that :existed be- tween him and the government. 'He seemed to be a quiet and domestic sort of caballero, who contented himself with smoking cigars, made of fine tobacco rolled in cylinders of white paper, in his balcony, window from morning till night; rejoicing in scarlet slippers'or a blue velvet cap with a tassel, and a miassive gold chain about his neck. When he was not moking he amused himself mn pacing before the Windows of his draw ing-room,; which, from the glimpses of its'interior the neighbors got from' time to time, was -fr- nished with, true Castilian magnificence; 'The exile. Was a tall, hpndomej dark i man, with t-he leat-Sgry Htheiworld  ledwth Us nixt    .  * . ,    black hair and graceful mustache. The regular- ity of his habits at length ceased to attract atten- tion, and he was suffered to enjoy his scarlet slippers, red cap and paper cigars without moles- tation; save that some gossips wondered that nobody ever saw him go out, and nobody ever entered there save a mysterious looking-Cuban servant, who always carried a mysterious covered basket with him. Indeed he was never seen without it, till it got to be inseparably associated in the neighbors' eyes with the man and the man with the basket. But there was another thing that moved the curiesity of some of the people of the opposite tenements; and this was the presence of a lady in the house-a lady young and surpassingly beautiful. No one could say that they had ever got a full and good sight of her face, but there were several who had caught glimpses of her fig- ure through the window; two or three who had heard her speak; and there was one little French wife of a shoemaker, who would have been will- ing to make oath on her husband's lapstone, that she had heard her sing, and that she sang like an angel. "She can't be his wife," said the sour-visaged better half of a perruquier to her neighbor, Jean Pirot, the little manufacturer of bad cigars, at one sous each, whose shop was four feet square in a window recess. "An' why not, woman, why not? It were more likely to be his wife than his- I "Daughter," said quickly the sharp-faced wo- man. "Yes, she is his daughter; for ,she is too young to be his wife."        . . "Yes, and I saw him put his arm about her and draw her to him proud-like, as if he was her father,".remarked a handsome young woman, who, standing in her doorway, was skillfully ar- ranging a bouquet of fresh flowers, to carry to. the cathedral as an offering, to the virgin. "Father or daughter," chimed in the cobbler's little wife to her husband, as he drove the last brad into the heel of a shoe, " they are, no doubt, great people, and do nobody harm.   For my ,part I like to see people live and-stay at home i" Here she cast a hard look very significantly at her lord, whose propensities to wander forth at night to the theatre, or the cafe, round the cor- ner, to -play dominoes, til, late bed-fime, were well known to the whole neighborhood, "It is very odd, though," remarked a thin :irenchman-in round iron spectacles, whose busi- -mess was to extact spots f rom badcloth gar-   r- ments, by an invention of his own, which not - only removed the spot but the cloth also; " it is t bien drole he never comes out in the day-time, - but goes out at night!" t  "Goes out by night!" repeated three or four r voices ; and the little cobbler shook his head I mystically, and his wife raised her eyes with sur- I prise, " goes out by night!" a  "There is no doubt of it," said the meagre ex- I tracter of spots; "I was, not long since, late at i night coming home with some clothing, which I had been a great ways to get, when, as I passed a his gate, I saw him going in. He was just un- a locking to enter. I saw his face by the light of r his cigar, which he puffed and illumined as I r passed him. He wore a Spanish cloak, which r covered him to his beard." "Going in is not exactly coming out," philo- sophically remarked the cobbler. "But he must have come out before he could X go in," very positively asserted the perrnquier, as if he -were laying down a proposition that t could not admit of disputation. "True, , true," ejaculated Jean, nodding his head affirmatively up and down, "I see, I see! vous avez raison, monsieur!" "But why does he keep his wife shut up so closely?, I would like to know that!" stoutly observed the woman, with a sort of mncing look at the closed windows of the Moorirk- ing house; for this gossip took place at the o0or of a little wine shop, on the corner vis-a-vis with the mansion, and about twilight, an hour wden all the working population desert their shops and back rooms to congregate on the trottoirs, to see and be seen, gossip and breathe the air. At such times all the important affairs of the neigh- borhood are discussed, and everything hidden laid open to the prying eye of morbid curiosity. !'"Prove,. woman, prove that it is his wife!" said the wine-seller, a short, stout-chested Italian, fromp the island' of Sicily, with a dark, glittering eye, a pleasant smile and good teeth, and a beard ample and black.  -   ;     , "He treats her too affectionate;for that," said the cobbler's better half with another horrible leer at her lordi which contained a volume of silent reproof. .     ;-  "I saw- him draw  her to him and kiss her," said the' old mother of the wine vender. "I sits here all day, and does nothin' but watches that house; because I am an old dame, and, can do no work. I've seen him," she added, in a trem- -ulous;palieod voice, "' take her aabo'ut the waist,   a-a-and-pat her cheek just like a father. No, no, good neighbors, she be not his wife, be sure o' that." Here the old woman thrust four fingers into a leathern sack that hung at her girdle, and which would hold about a pint of snuff, and abstracting a third of an ounce, began shoving it up her huge nostrils. "I, too, have seen persons go there and be ad- mitted, and come out late at night," said a por- ter, who, passing with his load and understand- ing the subject of their gossip; "mysterious looking people they were, too; the secret way they acted, as if they'd like to be inwisible if they could." "There is no doubt something wrong there altogether," remarked the cobbler, gravely, as he peered up at the house through his circular iron spectacles i," the police guard ought ne'er to keep eyes off. it. A whole year the man has lived there, and never yet had heel or-sole tapped,; no doubt he keeps in to save shoe-leather, and starve the honest cobbler." "No doubt, friends," said a ragged man, with a red nose, who seemed to have no other home than the wine shop, wherie he lounged the most of his time, " no' doubt he has his reasons for this , mystery, as you call it. He is an exile, that we know. He has, therefore, enemies who might fol/im here and do him a mischief; for the sea tween here and Havana is as open to them as it was to him. Perhaps he stays at. home to keep: from 'being made a sheath for their long knives." "Thou hast hit the peg on the head, friend, I'll warrant thee," said the cobbler, with empha- sis. "I see it all now as clear as an instep." "But how do you account for the people seen going in so secret at night'?" inquired, scepti- cally, the porter, as he looked in the face of the man who had no home but the tap. "Those are doubtless his friends from Cuba, who are in the city on a visit, and go to see him secretly in order that when they return to Ha- vana the captain-general may not suspect them of mischief; for I know enough to know that he has his spies here, who watch every Cubad gen- tleman that comes to this city, with an hundred eyes, especially since the rumors about the inva- sion." "This, then, makes all clear," said the cob. bler's wife, in a tone of satisfaction, " but I should like to know whether that be his daughter, and if so, why one so fair should keep herself shut up like a nun."   "No doubt she loves to keep her father com- pany," answered the wine seller: "Nothing is more natural." This rejoinder seemed to give general satisfac- tion, and as the, shades of evening began to de- scend upon the streets, one neighbor after another sought his or her domicil in the rear of their re- spective shops; and soon the street was quiet save the occasional step of a passer-by on his way to some appointment, or seeking, his own pastime. From these gossippings the reader will see that the house was an object of some interest, or rather the character and habits of its occupants, in the neighborhood. The aspect of things con- tinued pretty amuch the same as has been de- scribed by) conversation, for some days after. The foreign gentleman smoked his paper segari- tos, and paced his balcony in his scarlet slippers and little fisherman's cap, and glimpses of a young and beautiful girl could be got from the street through the open folds of a rich orange- colored curtain, that partly shaded 'the tall win- dows that opened on the balcony. The servant, with his mysterious basket, went out and came in after dark; and twice the gentleman himself was seen to be admitted after the watchman had called his second hour. But no more strangers were seen to apply for late entrance, as had been the case some weeks before; so that at length the gossips ceased to regard the house, or trouble themselves any further about the habits of its occupants. At length, one clear moonlight night, about three weeks after, the little bit of cerner gossip we have detailed, just after the clock had tolled twelve, and the ringing staves of the watchman had ceased to echo along the avenues of the city, the good folk in the vicinity of the casa granda, as the mysterious house was called, were awaken- ed by a guitar, accompanied by a manly voice that seem to flow from a soul full of melody. "Hist, wife l" whispered the little cobbler, giving his soporific dame a nudge in the ribs with his elbow; " dost hear that?" "Yes, to be sure, man; dost think I'm deaf, and have got no feeling in my ribs, that you should wake me up in this fashion 1" "I wanted you to hear it. It is some gallant, I' warrant me, that is serenading the exile's pretty daughter; for it comes from that way."' Hereupon both got up, under the influence of lively curiosity, to peep through their shutters. At the same time the wine seller crept to his lattice, and the perraquier and his betar half   made their way to a broken pane in their win- dow. The eyes of all were gratified at seeing under the dark shadows of the balcony, a darker figure, leaning gracefully against one of the pil- lars that supported it, from whom proceeded the music that swelled so sweetly throughout the neighborhood. , "4 young man and handsome to boot," said the wife of the perraquier. "What dost thou know about handsome men, woman?" retorted the jealous perruquier, sharp- ly. "Thou hadst best be in bed!" "Not much since I have known thee, Pierre Jacques," re. ponded the lady " thou art not so well favored that I should, by seeing thee, know what it is to know about handsome men."?' Pierre was silent. The singer was evidently young, for his voice had the rich modulation of youth but whether he were handsome or no could not be discerned, inasmuch as the place where he stood was dark, and he wore his cloak as close about his face as he could to-touch his guitar with freedom. "Whoever he is," said the wine merchant to the cobbler, whose window was next,to his and within low talking distance, "he plays like a master. Ne'er heard I guitar struck with a touch like that l" "Nor I, by St. Crispin, nor I!" said the cob- bler, with admiring emphasis. "Dost under- stand his words?" "Listen! they are Spanish It is a song of love 1" "I would be sworn," answered the cobblers   "you will ne'er catch a gallant singing a wine ballad under his lady's window. Hist 1" "There is a green isle on the sunny blue sea, Its air is perfumed with the fragrance of flowers; O fly, dearest lady, O fly there with me, To that pleasant green isle and its orange-gold bowers. Nor sorrow nor care shall ever come there, To cause thee a tear or bring thee a fear, If thou wilt now fly, sweet maiden; with me, To my pleasant green isle in the midst of the sea. Then fly, lady, fly, BWile the stars in the sky Hold their torches of light, to guide through the night Our bark of delight, to our home in the isle, The pleasant green isle, The sunny green isle, in the midst of the sea." "By my best flask of Bordeaux!" ejaculated the wine seller, " but that is a right brave song, and a fair challenge." '"No doubt," said the- cobbler;, but thinkest thou he is a king of an isle? Doubtless such a king as Sancho Panza, and such an island, too. But then one don't look for men to tell truth when they make love." "I always knew thou didst lie hard when thou camest courting me," said his wife, gruffly; " now do I know it. Out upon thee, man I! You told me thou wast worth five hundred crowns in lea- ther, and all the leather thou hadst was thy own hide!" Here the cobbler smiled stealthfully i' the dark, a sort of inaudible chuckle, at his having circumvented his wife in their courtship; but as it was dark so that she could not see the smile, he did not get his head broken.   CHAPTER IV. THE MANSION AND ITS INMATES.   ' THE serenader now played a spirited battle piece on his guitar, and accompanied it with his voice, imitating a trumpet ai the charge. It was very fine, and elicited the admiration of the whole of his invisible audience- qt garret and bed room windows. This was followed by a song representing the Arab's farewell to his steed; at the close of which, when the Arab, refusing to sell him, leaps into the saddle and gallops to- wards the desert like the wiiid, the serenader made the strings 6f his guitar ing anid gallop in perfect imitation of the galloping steed, the noise receding and keceding till it finally died away in thie distance inito silence.' The cobbler and perruquier, wh6 wer6 both 'amiateurs in their way, one on 'the jewshaip and the other on casta- nets, here loudly eiincored, not a little to the sur- pris'e of the serenadper, who, finding himself en- tertainifig a' larger 'audience than he contem- plated, thfireW his cloak about himn, and with his' guitar beneath his 'arm whalked. slbwly up the street and disappeared in th'e da'BLiess 'caused'by a row of catalpa trees that grew near the walls of the old Ursuline Convent, which was on the adjacent square.  The cobbler and his wife-re- tired:to 'their' straw, the perruquier and his wife once more courted sleep, and the bachelor wine seller f iung hidmseif upon' his cot mattress with a higite cigar, 'and smoked hmself into proont d iep   s^as Wuris citoft.   Silence once more reigned over the scene with- out.. The black shadows of the houses lay over half the breadth of the street, like a fathomless pool, while the part on which the moon shone sI eemed strewn with silver dust. If any curious eye had been watching the windows of the bal- "cony, they would' have seen the green jalousies slowly open and a female form,. alf concealed, half visible, appear, and gaze up and down the street. Then the hand glanced an instant, like i a ray of light in the moon, as it cast over the balcony a flower, which fell unheeded to the sidewalk. In a few minutes the serenader re-appeared from the shadow of the convent walls, and com- ing again under the balcony caught up the flow- er, as if he had been looking for it, and placing it to his lips, glanced once up to the balcony and then striking his guitar thrice, walked rapidly away in the direction of the river. We will now introduce the reader into the in- terior of the mansion at the moment when the first note of the serenader's voice fell on the ears of tie inmates. Late. as the hour was, there ware two wax candles burning on' a imarble- table in the drawing-room, which gav/e sufficient light to disclose the elegance of the apartmnit, which was furnished in the most luxurious Spanish , tlfi ' At  table ifksat a gntlema:n busiy ent   gaged in writing and replying to letters; and opposite to him sat a young lady. taking copies of the letters which he wrote, before he sealed and directed them. They had been three hours engaged in this occupation, interrupted at inter- vals by conversations which the letters replied to elicited; for that very evening a mail from Cuba had brought them a large number of letters, which evidently were of the highest importance. They were all addressed to "Don Garcia de Annmas." This was the name of the gentleman at the table, who, from the scarlet slippers upon his feet, was clearly the same person whose retired habits had given food for gossip to the neighbor- hood. He was about fifty years of age, dark and handsome, with black hair with a slight inclina- tion to turn gray, and an elegant mustache. His whole air and bearing was that of a finished gen- tleman-a true Spanish cavalier of the ancient Castilian regime. His smile was beautiful, and his air courageous and commanding. He was a person for men to admire and womefn to con- fide in; as if both his heart and arm, his word and his honor, could be trusted. Upon his finger burned like a coal of fire, a superb diamond. A ruby of great beauty glowed in his bosom, and as his dressing-gown was open, the hilt of a jew- elled dagger could be seen half exposed, as if accidentally, it being worn for use rather than show. 'His hand was small and brown, and beautifully' shaped, a feature that distinguishes peculiarly the nobles of Spain. But how shall our pen. describe the youthful lady! The words that we shall make use of to paint her in the glory of her beauty, will but fee- bly portray her. Imagine an oval face, dark brows, such as the Persian poets say houris in paradise have, eyes as black as night, but night with a star in its depths, and lashes that curve and sweep the cheek, giving twilight or morning to the suns they shade, as they are lifted or cast down. Imagine that these large, glorious dark eyes are animated and living with fire of thought, glow of passion, warmth of affection, and that they can communicate to the heart of the be- holder all their intense emotions. Fancy a nose as pretty as Eve;s nose must have been when she was created, fresh and faultless, out of the heart of Adam. As for the mouth, there is nothing to compare it with which it would not surpass. Cherries, roses, tulips, coral! it was more beau- tiful than either, or all combined! in a w ord, it wuas a  wamt pouting, red, cu pid-shapedmaiden   ly mouth, that would have cheated a honey bee into the belief that he had lighted-upon some honeysuckle of a new genus, more richly lus- cious with sweets than any flower it had e'er met in its flight. The olive cheek was delicately tinted with the color of the moss-rose leaf, and grew deeper with the depth of each emotion. Her forehead was as fair and smooth as the fra- grant magnolia leaf, and her dark rich hair was half plain, half abounding in natural tresses, so that one could not decide whether the becoming style in which she wore it were all art or all na- ture, it was so tasteful and perfect a combination of the two. Her head, as she sat listening to a letter the gentleman was reading to her, was ad- mirably cast, superbly set upon a queenly neck, blending grace in every motion with the repose of gentle dignity. Once, at a few words in the letter which moved her, she raised it in a spirited manner, as the Arabian courser or the forest fawn lifts the head to listen to the trumpet or the bay of the hunting hound. She wore a closely-fitting black velvet robe, ornamented at the. cuffs and at the bosom, which heaved in its maidenly un- dulations like a summer ocean, -----" soft and slow As the heaving tide doth. flow; Ever heaving, ne'er at rest, There love rocketh to his rest! Gently cradled on this billow, Seeketh love no other pillow!" - The maiden was not only beautiful, but she was intelligent and sensible, as every line of her noble countenance bore testimony. She listened with an appreciating and practical understand- ing as the gentleman read to her from the letter, which showed that she was worthy of the confi- dence which he seemed to repose in her;- for at one time he would consult with her, while at another they would compare opinions. As we introduce them to the reader they are engaged, the one reading from a letter, the other in bending over and listening, her arrested pen held gracefully in her hand. . We will hear the close of this letter, which is the ninth that is to be read and responded to since the mail came in. It is the gentlfman that reads: "As to the means, senor," says Sanchez- Is- naga, "those will not be wanting. The sinews of this enterprise are already collected and ready to be appropriated. It is men-it is troops we want. These must come from the United States. Our emissaries have visited severad itiies, and of! it3 r w$ a- e- r ' x w6 tt ;   learned if money can be guaranteed, men can be obtained. There are in the several towns of the Union hundreds of restless adventurer who have fought on the fields of Mexico, who will rally to the standard of invasion, if officers can be obtain- ed to lead them. It is these we need. We must have men of character-gentlemen who have seen service, whose courage in battle has been tried, and in whom their men will have confi- dence. This must be your task'and province to look to, if you will undertake it. Your position, your wealth, your military talents, your popular manners, all point to you as the most efficient agent to secure the services of military Ameri- cans to take part in the enterprise. The subse- quent enlisting of followers will be their duty, not yours. You are authorized by the junta to command half a million to secure the services of forty-five commissioned officers and twenty-five hundred men. But the enclosed papers from the 'committee for the protection of Cuban in- terests ' will enter into particulars. There is no doubt that in six weeks, with secrecy and dili- gence, a liberating army of five thousand men may land upon our shores!" "God grant it!" repeated the young girl, with a glowing cheek. "This letter gives me the full power I have been:expecting. My interviews with these Amer ican officers, from time to time, have not been thrown away. I now know whom to gain   The 1 way is clear.  I begin to feel, my child, that ' Cuba will yet be free! Here is a letter from'  Lopez, who will soon be among us. He says: "The idea of creating a revolution in the isl- i and without foreign aid, is not to be held. The Cubans have so long been bowing their necks t beneath the yoke of their masters, that they do r not know how to act as becomes men!   They s must have examples!   They must be inspired t by successes!  They must feel confident of the f overthrow  of the government before they will g commit themselves. Therefore it is that these t gentlemen and those gentlemen with whom   I tf talk, although they smart under the tyranny they are victims of, say, We dare not move in it I If p we fail after having committed ourselves, we are o lost I  Strike a blow first, and if we see that the e power of the captain-general totters, we will then n put our hand to the lever, and topple him over!' h Thus you see we must work with swords held in other men's hands. Our only resource is in the brave and, r orlkanlike American.- There w 2   e are among them thousands of hearts that beat e for us, and if the present enterprise is conducted e with secrecy, it will be successful. I shall join- ) you in a few days after this letter reaches you. - Be prompt, therefore, in securing your men, and t let every precautionary meahs be used to con- , e ceal every step from the government. Our last i failure should teach us a lesson in the present - organization." "Noble and brave Narciso Lopez," said the X maiden. "He is a true hero, and will yet be the liberator of Cuba." "The affair is coming to a crisis; Gertrude," said Don Garcia. "Here are drafts for the large amount of money to be placed at my disposal; and they are so prepared that they can be nogo- tiated in this city. It is now time for me to act in earnest. The ten months I have been here made me acquainted with all the materials that I now need to work upon'. To-day is the 8th of April. By the first of May a force will be in motion that shall make the throne of Spain tremble to its base! Hast thou copied the letter in reply to Senor Hernandez, that noble patriot son of a patriot sire?" ' "Here it is, dear father. Hie says he will come and take command in the liberating army.  It is like him." "Here also is a letter I have written to young Senor de Macias, of Havana, who courts a posi- tion in the staff with General -- . But these appointments the American general must him- self fill. It is due to him in courtesy." "Do   you think, sir, that this brave General , you speak of, will really take a command in the liberating army?" "Without question. I  shall, however, write to him to-night, informing him that all is now ready to organize, and that the expedition must sail as early as practicable ere its movements get to the ears of government, and obstacles, as be.- fore, be thrown in our way. Do you think that 0 gallant young cavalry officer who came here three weeks ago with Colonel -- , will consent to go?" The question caused a visible confusion-a pretty, maidenly confusion, to appear in the cheek of the Senorita Gertrude, and she dropped her eyes, and a  sweet expression played about her mouth, as if the allusion pleased as much as it had surprised her. "I  mean Captain de Clifford!" "Captain Clifford, sir  I do not think he will join, air. He is a soldier of the Ameroau   army, and was attached to the staff. He would hardly resign." "He would be of great service to our cause, Gertrude. His rank, his family, his fine cour- age, his noble appearance, his popularity with his troop, who, I am told, would follow him, if he would lead, to certain death. Young, ardent and experienced in war as he is, he must be gained over!" "I would do everything to gain him, father; but I fear he will never desert his colors!" "It would be no desertion of them-no dis- -'honor. Let him resign, to unite his fortunes with ours, and share in the glory of the libera- tion of Cuba. YoU may have influence with him, and I pray thee use it if he should call again." "I promise to do so, father! The glory of Cuba is next to my heart, and I will use every means that a maiden may to aid her cause. But I fear I should have little influence with El Se- nor Captain Clifford." "What is that music? It is a guitar, is it not?" "Yes-and a voice I It is-- ." "Who?" "I will go and see, sir," she answered, check- ing herself, as if she was ashamed at betraying too openly the depth of her feelings.   4"It is some one honoring you with a serenade, my child. I am pleased at this. I do not like to have you so secluded and forgotten as circum- stances have rendered it necessary. It is doubt- less Don Rodrigo, or Senor de Alamo, our Cu- ban friends, who do you this honor." "Dost thou not know Don Rodrigo hath no voice to sing, father, and though Senor de Alamo sings, his voice never poured forth such rich tides of melody!" "Thine ear, child, is better'tuned than mine. Whose voice and skill is it, think you?" "It is doubtless Captain Clifford's voice, sir," she answered demurely, as she stood within the drapery of the window to listen, with a heart bounding and a cheek glowing. At length the serenade ceased, and, she saw and recognized his form as he crossed the moon- light in his retreat. She gazed. after him a mo- ment, and seeing him linger in the shade of the convent, she hastened to her escritoire, wrote a line upon a slip of paper, wrapped it about a rose which she plucked from a vase in the window, tied it with a tress of her shining dark hair, and opening the lattice, waved her snowy arm and flung it over the balcony. She watched, un- seen, till he picked it up, and then re-entering the room resumed her copying, but with a pen that traced'the lines with many a blot. ,   CHAPTER V. MDNIGHT WATCHERS AND JEALOUS PLOTTINGi   THE serenader had no sooner left the shadow of the balcony after he had picked up the rose, than a person, hitherto unseen, stole forth from the covert of one of the tile-roofed piazzas that projected across the walk that passed the wine- shop. He had been standing with another man for some time in the secrecy of his concealment, gazing up to the windows of the Casa Granda opposite with intense interest, even before the serenader had made his appearance: their pres- sence, therefore, had no connection with that of the cavalry officer. "Art thou sure, that this is the house, Tito?" he had said in a low whisper when they both first stopped under the stoop. The person to whom he spoke had a small, undersized figure, attired in a tight-fitting. sail- or's jacket, properly ornamented with bell-but- tons. He wore striped Mexican trowsers, se- cured at the waist by a red Spanish sash wound several times around the- body. In the sash was stuck a knife, and out of its folds protruded the butt of a small pistol. Hanging from   his left shoulder, like a short cloak, was his outer jacket. He had upon his perfumed locks a blue'and red striped cap, the tassel of which hung over his eyes, half hiding, half-revealing the blackest pair of 'wicked, assassin-like orbs that were ever planted beneath a pair of dark brows.   This diminutive and. fanciful-looking little man was plainly inferior in rank to the individ- ual with whom he was in company. The latter was plainly a gentleman. His dress, air and tone bespoke the man of breeding. His age was full forty-five, yet he carried his -years well, and would have passed for a much more youth- ful man. In person, he was commanding, and had a haughty carriage that seemed habitual to him. They had approached the corner of the street together from the direction of the river, the smaller and inferior- man going before, as if serving as a guide; the other, showing by his uncertain step that he was a stranger in the city, or, at least, to that quarter of it. When they reached the comer, the serenader, as we have already remarked$ had not yet come uponi the ground. "There is no mistake, senor capitan," answer- ed the man, touching his cap respectfiully. "I saw him on the balcony twice to-day, and made sure that it was he." "You say you saw not the Donna Aertrude herself I How can you be certain that she is alWo here" '" "i never do things by halves, senor. I made inquiry of a garrulous cobbler, whose stall is hereabouts, and he assured me that there was a   young lady in the house, and that Don Garcia certainly lived here. By the mass! The cobbler would have told me, from his own invention, the history of their lives; and begun by trying to make me understand that the mysterious ca- ballero was at least a robber-chief, and ran away with the lovely lady. But finding I knew more than he did, he would have pushed me! But I did not gratify him!" "Will you silence your tongue, Tito? If this is the hove, let us not bring notice upon ourselves. Tose jalousies may conceal ob- serving eyes!"Here the cavalier paced up and down thoughtfully, frim time to time pausing in his walk to look up to the windows. "All is silent! Doubtless she sleeps! Sweet and pleasant be thy dreams, fair and proud one! Dost thou ever dream of me! All, that I could make thee love me! that I had some potent spell, some cunning love-powder, that would cause thee to turn upon me those glorious eyes in kindness. Fortune has discovered thee to my research-and if once we meet, love or hate, thou and I must never part more I This I swear by my hopes of heaven! All, proud beauty! If I may not win thee with thy consent, I will win thee without it! Life is misery without thy love! Once mine, cannot I teach thee by gen- tleness and tenderness, to give,me thy love! By the holy rood, I'll make the attempt!" "Senor, some one approaches!" said Tito, softly, as with one hand he pointed up the street, and with the other instinctively touched his dagge;-hilt. "Don't be too quick to use'thy steel! Orleans is not Havana, where a man may do a deed of blood without peril to himself. Put up thy knife, and stand back and let the person go on! We need not in this city look upon every man we meet as a foe! Learn peace, fellow!" "I will always look upon men as foes," mur- mured Tito; "I nor thou have not anything to fear on the earth but our fellow-men. Seej it is a cavalier." "Yes, he treads like a soldier; he stops be- neath the balcony. See, he displays a guitar. Does he intend to serenade the lady, Tito?" muttered the Spaniard through his shut teeth. "Shall I kill him if he does?" "No-no I B  quiet, villain! My foes are too high for thy steel!. I have weapons and can use them  if need be unto death I He strikes the strings, and begins to sing!" The Spaniard listened with impatience that 1   scarcely could be controlled, to the song, the words of which we have already given; and al- so endured the subsequent passages upon the guitar. But it was painful endurance. With his hands clutched, his teeth set, his eyes glanc- ing fire, he waited till he had ended the serenade, and he saw him walk away towards the convent. He lingered to watch the balcony to see if any signs of the serenade having been heard or the serenader noticed, and was about to follow the retiring lover, when the quick eyes of .Tito caught the gentle motion of the jalousies. "-'st, senor capitan I there is a movement up there!" The Spaniard looked quickly up again, and saw the blinds slowly open; he then saw the la- dy appear, as we have described her, half visible, and beheld her look earnestly in the direction taken by the serenader. He saw her toss .the rose over the balustrade, and the-rapid return of the stranger to take it up. "This is a fair business-a fair business!" he muttered. "So, the icy-hearted Donna Gertrude has warmed at last and has a lover." "Shall I pick it up, senor?" officiously asked Tito. "No, let it lay. He should have what is sent to him. If need be, we can take it from him afterward." "That will be better, senor. Things that are taken in combat are worth more for it." They remained quiet while the young man passed and seized the bouquet, pressing it to his lips, an act which the Spaniard from his covert beheld with rage, and echoed with a curse. ",Now you have a foe as well as a mistress, senor," said Tito; " there is nothing like increas- ing one's circle of friends." . "Silence! your tongue is too free!" "It is a blessed thing it is free, your worship; for if it were tied, I should talk through my nose, which would be extremely disagreeable." "Look you, Tito Do you not see an object where the rose fell? Cross the street and ex amine." "I see something, senor; but it is not likely she dropped a second bouquet for you, for doubt- less she thinks you are far over the sea." "If she thinks of me at all," sighed the Span- iard within himself. "Go and pick it up." Tito instantly returned and placed in his hand what he had found, saying: "It seems to be a twisted billet-doux, senor, tied about loosely with a strand of hair-,   The Castilian stranger grasped it from his hand,and walking quickly round the corner into the moonlight, examined it. It was a slip of pa- per and a tress of hair. He opened the paper and read by moonlight, these words: "If Captain Clifford will do her the honor to I call at eight o'clock to-morrow evening, Donna Gertrude will thank him for the serenade," Upon reading this, the gentleman convulsive- ly clutched it in his fingers, and shook his clenched hand as if at his invisible destiny--he bit his lip till the blood sprung in drops. Tito watched his emotion with interest, yet with cool- ness. "Bad news, senor?" "Do not speak! Silence! This is madness!" "Is it not Donna Gertrude after all?", "She  Yes, herself-her very self, with all her old disdain! O yes, you have showed me the right house I I saw her face-her sculptured arm waving in the moon-! I here read her hand- writing! O yes, it is-she!"All this was spoken in a tone of intense and scornful passion. "It is she.! and this writing It was doubtless wrapped about the bouquet, and bound with her- hair too! it was disengaged in striking the pave- ment, and he bore off only the rose!" "It was enough for him! You have the hair, senor; and the note, and can't complain." "Nevertheless, that rose shall cost him his life -that song shall be his death-song 1" "Let us hasten after him, senor He has al- ready got out of sight!" "No!" "We shall lose him!" "O, no! I have his name here." "May I ask what it is?"' ".Clifford." Tito started; he seemed interested. "What other name?"   a "Captain Clifford, says the note." "Por Dios! I knfew I had heard that voice 1" cried Tito, starting off upon a run, his hand on his dirk. "Come back! whither do you go so fast?" "To bury my knife in his-heart!" "Wilt thou come back? If you do not obey me, I will thrust my sword through and through your little body! He is my foe, not yours, mal- dito." "Mine first, your worship," responded Tito, slowly returning to the comer. , How yours?" ' I knew that voice had been heard by me be-   fore, and so I wanted to kill him. He was in Mexico.- He killed my master!" "You are mistaken." "No it was at the city of Mexico when los Americanos entered. My master you know was general of cavalry. He was defending a battery. I was by his' side when the American captain came charging up the street at the head of a score of his horsemen. He ordered my master to surrender, who disdaining to yield his sword, attempted to take him prisoner, when this Cap- tain Clifford-I know him well--cut him down at a blow to the very chine. He then rode over me as if I had been a carrion. I will kill him, senor!" he added, deliberately. "Not until I have met him. He is my rival-- his life is sacred to me, Tito; and, if after I have avenged myself upon him and he breathes, you shall have your vengeance, also." "I suppose I must obey, senor; but we are losing time while he is gaining on us. It will be too late to find him if we do not follow him." "Vamos, entonces!" cried the Castilian, as he threw his cloak across his left shoulder and moved on after his servant, whose anxiety to come in sight of the serenader sent him far ahead of his master. The latter walked on with swift strides, and both were soon lost to the eyes'  of a gend'arme, who from his guard-box near had kept his watchful eyes upon the two men with curiosity to ascertain their motive in seek- ing concealment in the dark covert of the roof that projected over the pavement. "Love, not murder," said the man, senten- tiously, as he resumed his promenade upon his "beat." The young American officer having disap-. peared from the eyes of the Castilian and his servant, walked on his way towards the river- side along a narrow street, which was almost in deep darkness from the height of the walls of the houses on either side. Not a ray ofi the moon fell upon its pavement; and not a light, save one solitary glimmer from an obscure habi- ';ation, was visible. Edward Clifford stopped op- posite this dwelling, which was one of those French maison-half shop, half house, so fre. quent in this city. He tapped lightly at the door,- and the small lattice above was darkened by a human head. -Qui va la?" demanded the man, in the voice an w,ords of a sentry, challenging. "Me, Giberto." "Ah, bueno I will come down and let you   in," answered the man in Spanish, but with a Mexican accent; and the next moment the door was unbarred and unlocked with no little bustle, as if the inmate kept himself secured as if he were in a castle. You keep up your old habits, Giberto, of locking and barring, I see," said Clifford, as he passed by a descending step into a low dark apartment that was strong with the smell of fresh tobacco. "Si, senor capitan. It is hard to give up the habits of an old soldier. Twenty years did I   serve in the castle of Chepultepec; and now I am a quiet citizen and live peaceably in the roll- ing and vending cigars I must, nevertheless, lock fast and strong. One feels safer, and can't be taken by surprise by an enemy-" While Giberto was talking he was busily bar- ring up the door again; he then passed a chain across the lock, having previously turned a mas- sive key round in its wards. He then led the way up a narrow stair, from which came the ra-  diance of a cande in the room above.   CHAPTER VI. INKLINGS OF. LOVE ADVENTURES.   WHEN Clifford had reached the room he sat down upon a straw-platted chair which the Mex- ican offered him, and then removing his bivouac cap, he laid his guitar down and glanced inquis- itively about the apartment. It did not present many objects to fix his attention. The room it- self was not more than four paces each way, had rough walls-white-washed once, but now brown with tobacco smoke, which seemed to constitute its native atmosphere. A low cot in one corner, a blue chest- in another, a pyramid of cigar- boxes in a third, and a pile of tobacco in the fourth, completed the chief part of the contents of -the room. There was a little round stone which served io hold a loaf of bread, a coffee cup and a plate of garlic or tortillas-the debris of which still remained upon it with the candle, which was stuck in the muzzle of an old pistol for-a candle-stick, the muzzle being kept upright by being secured in a block of wood. A crucifix of black Wood hung on anail over a leathern case that held a razor, which was flanked by a bit of broken looking-glass. Above tih door was a rack or- pair of beckets, in which was swung an old musket; and above the musket hung a huge broad-curved sword, such as are used in the Mexican artillery. There was also an ancientdagger driven strongly into the pars tition by the side of the door, on which, was tusa pended a yellow Mexican uniform coat :for a sergeant's grade, and with it a belt ands:toat- I   ; plate, on which was displayed the Mexican eagle trampling upon a serpentp "You still retain your old friends, Gibetto, and your little domicil looks as warlike as your old guard-house used to." "Hdon't know, senor, when I may get tired, of making cigars and being a quiet citizen, and may want to take up arms again." "You must get a wife, now, Giberto. Noth- ing like a domestic partner to keep a man in one spot." The Mexican sergeant grimly smiled and shook his head as he stroked his grisly mous- tache.  "The women do for young men. I am get- ting old, senor. Besides, I love my freedom What could I do with a woman? I could no t sip my coffee inpeace for her gossip. Besides, I love to be alone; with a wife always about, one can never be by himself.: I don't want a wife. They'll do for fools or young men! wo- men don't understand old soldiers, and would play the mischief with their comforts. Here you see, I can-sit up till midnight, and smoke and be quiet till I feel like going to: sleep; Whereas if I had a wife, it would be, "Giberto, hombre, come to bed i Giberto, bruto, put out the can- dle, I can't sleep I Giberto, vilano, you are sti- fling my nose with your smoking:] Giberto  Giberto I Giberto I Ah, senor capitan, let us not talk of wives i"    The cavalry officer smiled and colored as he said, gaily: "You are a women-hater, I see, Giberto. - We wont talk about your wife, but we'll talk about mine!" "[Ah, bueno! with the greatest pleasure in the world, senor! You are young and should take' a wife. You can then mould and form your habits-while they are pliant, till you can march together at lock-step without treading on each other's heels; but an old mustache can never get into new habits. It is like breaking his back." "You are not old-not forty-eight, Giberto?" "Fifty-four last Easter eve, senor. Yet I am not an old man; for I am strong as ever, save the wound I got at the castle-it makes me limp a little. Ah, senor, when I think of that day, and how you saved me from the bayonets of the two Kentucky grenadiers after I was struck down, I feel that I can never forget you or feel too grateful to you I I would follow you to the world's end; for my life is yours 1" Here the stout soldier's voice was thick with emotion; and he laid his hand impressively up- on his heart, while his eyes looked gratitude and devotion. "You have returned it more than once, Gi- berto," answered Clifford. "I. no, senor I have done nothing. It is true I exposed myself afterwards by coming se- cretly to your quarters in the city to see you and thank you; and for this when I was arrested on suspicion of favoring the Americans, you ob- tained my release, or I Should have been shot. But you came with an order from   Governor Quitman, and  my prison doors were thrown open. -Ah, sener capitan, I am a rough soldier, but I know  how to be grateful. And' more, when you found that my countrymen were my enemies,. and that my life would be forfeited as soon as the American army should evacuate the city, you promised me your protection to your own  land. And you have not falsified your pledge. I am here in safety and am doing well!" "I hope you make money, Giberto V' "Yes, I  can't complain. Industry will bring gold. I am content. You honor me by ndticing me  This is twice you have visited my poor shop. Did the cigars please you you had from me last Tuesday i" "They were the pure puros, Giberto." "I know them to be excellent. They are such as I make for Don Garcia.:- 'And he sends his    ,   ; tobacco to me, which his servant gets, he informs me, from an estate of his in Cuba. There is not 3 so good a judge of a good cigar or cigaritto, as t Don Garcia." "Do you speak of Don Garcia de Armas?" 3 . ",Lo mismo, senor! That is his name. I i have never seen hiMn. He buys through his ser-. r vant, who is a Cuban, a man of shrewd wit, and hath the learning of a padre." "Then you make cigars for Don Garci " re- r marked or rather soliloquized Clifford, as is he was reflecting what might be made out of the fact. "You have called here late, senor capitan? It must be, at least I hope so, to get me to serve thee in some way. Dost thou want gold  I have a hundred onzas at thy service. Young gallants sometimes miscalculate the depth of their purses. My gold will be at good interest with thee and safer than in my chest-fires, you know, robbers, a hundred accidents-" "Nay, good Giberto, not gold. If I need it, I will not'fail to ask thee." "Thou wilt do me a kindness if thou wilt." "Dost thou know the history of this Don Garcia ." "Pieces of it, here and there, as the servant chose to communicate." "He is an exile, I learn, from Cuba .?" "Yes, sent from the island for being engaged in the affair of last fall, which was nipped in the bud by the .United States squadron blockad- ing the troops on Cat Island. He was a leader in the junta of conspirators; and his name com- ing out, he had to fly, only in time to save his head, and after the captain-general found he had gone, he ba'nished him in a;formal manner." "'This I had partly understood.  He has a 'daughter?" "So I was told by the man; but I have never seen her." "I have.  Listen to:a few words from me, Gi- berto." "   A thousand, senor dapitan. I see niw that the wife is coming I' "Ah, I  fear med not, Giberto I I do not feel so 'sanguine. But' Iwish to consult with you, 'and thetfore I called' here: It was on the ini. pulse of tihe moment, finding myself near your shop and seeing the light from the window. You are discreet; sensible, wise and cool. This noble exile has a daughter about nineteen years old, as beautiffl as a Madonhal I have 'seel hbtr hree times, and to-ght., a fouith time ha   a glimpse of her lovely person. You shall hear how it was, and then, perhaps, you can be of as- sistance to me in furthering my object, should obstacles intervene, as is more than likely." '"I will -aid you all in my poor ability, senor capitan, either in carrying billets, or in carrying her off," answered the soldier, as he lighted a fresh cigar, though not -without first proffering one to his guest, who was too much in love even to smoke.                v "Four weeks ago, Giberto, I chanced to lounge into the chapel of the old Convent des Ursulines when mass was over. The church seemed deserted, and I was walking round gaz- ing at the pictures and paintings, when I saw before a shrine of the virgin a young girl kneel- ing and praying from her golden missal. Upon seeing me, she rose in some embarrassment, blushed deeply, and threw her veil over her face, but not before I had discovered it to be beautiful beyond any female face I had ever beheld or dreamed of. I stood entranced for an instant, feeling all the blood in my veins rushing to my heart. The superb grace of her movements as she slowly retired, the undulating motion of her floating figure, intoxicated my senses. As she reached the entrance of the chapel, she stopped to dip her finger in the font of holy water, and turning, she faced the high altar, and gracefully kneeling for an instant in homage to the image of the crucified Saviour there enthroned, she cross- ed her brow and bosom with the liquid drops, and then disappeared from my eyes like a vision  'When one is suddenly awakened. My first im- pulse was to follow her, to ascertain if so charm- ing a creature had an earthly abode. I felt that my happiness depended on seeing and speaking with her, on loving and being loved. I hastened to leave the chapel, and as I reached the door, I saw on the pavement near the font where she had kneeled, a glove of rose-color. I caught it up and pressed it to my lips with rapture, and then gazing on the pretty toy, I saw that it had a clasp of three small diamonds at the wrist. I was tempted to kneel where she knelt and to dip my finger into the font where she had dipped; but I feared it would be sacrilege as I am not a Catholic, and it would have been prompted more from adoration of her than from pious senti- ments." "You did well, senor capitan. Sacred things are too mysterious to be treated lightly,' observe ed the artillery-man, devoutly crossing himself upon the breast of dis jacket, which was a sort   r of blue undress fatigue coat, a relic of the past. "But pardon, senor! "I followed her at once to restore her the glove, on the inside of the diamond clasp of r which I also discovered the name, "GERTRUDE DE ARMAS." This name I had heard once be- , fore at a dinner-party, where some officers had spoken of having heard of such a lady, the daughter of an exile who dwelt very retired, and was remarkable for her uncommon loveliness. Upon gaining the street, I saw her followed by a thin, tall, yellow slave, who had waited in the vestibule for her to come out of the chapel. I hastened to overtake her, which I did as she stopped at a large green gate that opened into the court of a Spanish house near the convent.' "The casa granda, senor. I have seen it and know it from the -servant's description; and the tall slave you speak of is the very Cuban who comes after cigarittos. He is not a mulatto, but I think partly Indian and Spanish Cuban. You described him exactly as tall, thin and yellow. But pardon, senor capitan!" "While the attendant was applying a key to the lock, I came near and presented her with the glove, saying I had picked it up in the chapel, and presumed it had been dropped by her. She received it, Giberto, with a smile of ravishing sweetness, and thanked me in a voice of the most charming music, and added that I had giv- en myself a great deal of trouble to restore so trifling a loss." "Then, senorita," said I, " allow me to retain the glove, leaving with you the bracelet which contains your name. The glove will be an in- valuable treasure to me." Upon this she looked prettily confused, and seemed to hesitate whether to comply or not with my bold request; at length she said, smiling: "I fear, senor, you would value it lightly. t think I will keep it; or else if I give it to you you will esteem it more than you ought, as we are strangers." "Strangers may become friends when they know one another better, senora," I replied. She then seemed to survey me comprehensively from head to foot, as if she would see whether I ought to be encouraged, and then, as if satisfied with this .womanly scrutiny of my propriety, she said, in the most gracious manner imaginable: ' "You are an American officer, senor ." "At your service, fair senorita," I responded. "My father has great respect for American soldier," she added. "If you nkit worth   your while, he would be pleased no doubt to cultivate your acquaintance." "Excelente, senor! This was acting like a lady at once. :None of your hypocrisy. about that. She liked your looks, capitan, and she thought she should like to know more of you. Commend me to her for a brave-hearted wo- man." "So I thought; for there was no boldness in this-but rather that frank, confiding manner which enchants one in all Spanish ladies." "Yes, Spanish ladies are more like true gen- tlemen- than any women in the world." "Well remarked and truly said, Giberto. There is a certain gentlemanly courtesy about them that is very striking and captivating. They seem to understand and have a fellow-feeling with a true gentleman. I, of course, profoundly thanked Donna Gertrude, and promised to do myself the honor of paying my respects at an early day to her father. Well, my good Giberto, I could not sleep, you may be assured, that night, for thinking of her. I thought over and over again all that she had said to me, recalled her beautiful face, her beaming smile, the splen- dor of her eyes, the richness of her lips; the grace and charm of every word and movement." '"That's the witchery of these pretty women, senor! Let them once get their eyes upon you, and you might as well surrender at once. Now, a man, we can knock him down or bayonet him if he looks saucily at you out of his eyes-but a pretty lass! Ojala! the more impertinent they look at you the more like a simple bobo a man feels. I would rather meet, a charge of infan- try than be in the power of three of these pretty women! The saints preserve me from them!"Here Giberto lighted a fresh cigar and puffed away with a resolute expression about his mouth, that seemed to say that he would die be- fore he would yield to los diablitas. - "No woman shall ever rob me of sleep, senor, capitan I! Par- don!" "The next day I arrayed myself with particu. lar care and called at the casa of Don Garcta,  sending up my   card. The daughter received E me with charming courtesy, and presenting -me to her noble-looking father, I was soon made to feel perfectly at home. Don Garcia praised the I courage of our army in Mexico, the generalship i of our leaders, and praised our nation. He then  E spoke of Cuba and Spain, and made allusion to e the probable separation of the island from the I regency of the peninsular throne. We came to \] 2*   be very fair friends. The daughter was as radi ant as the star of the morning. She joined in the conversation with an intelligence and wit that surprised and delighted me. She sang for me, with both harp and guitar. Our voices mingled in the same dissolving notes. We bent over the same page! I was in paradise. But I will not annoy you, my worthy woman-hater  I was invited by Don Garcia to repeat my visit, especially as while I was there the French con- sul called to see him, whom I knew intimately; and his friendly recognition of me 'secured the confidence I had gained as an entire stranger. The next evening I called and became more deeply in love still. I instructed her in the more perfect pronunciation of my own language. I related to her, at her request, scenes of warlike adventure I had passed through in Mexico. She discoursed to me of her native Cuba, of its pe- rennial beauty, of its balmy air and sunny skies; but she sighed as she 11lluded to its degrading position under the rranny of Spain. I could not but sympathiz6ewith her in all her feelings. She perceived this, and regarded me with the tenderness of interest I sought to awaken in her' heart. When I parted with her it was with the' exquisite assurance that there was kindledi iA her bosom  an answering warmth to the flae// that burnt in my own. "Three days ago, I again met her. It Kin/m the chapel where we first saw one another. She was kneeling before the Christ in the Garden. I drew near and standing unseen gazed upon her beautiful countenance which reflected all the tearful grief of that sacred scene of agony. I was deeply moved-rather, I confess, at her pure piety than at the representation. Impulsively, I knelt by her side! I mingled my prayers with hers from  the same missal. We neither spoke to the other. It was to her too sacred a time for lighter emotion. I tried to worship, but wor- shipped only her. At the close of the prayers, she closed the book, and turning towards me, re- garded mhe throrgh the glittering glory of her tearful eyes wi th a grateful and pleased expres- sion, which rmsAde me feel ashamed of myself for not being 'w'at she evidently believed I felt. We left th/e chapel together, and as she crossed her brow rwith the holy element, I bowed my forehead to receive from  her hand the sacred sign. AIt seemed to me to seal our hearts togeth- er. Virom that moment confidence sprung up'in her heart and beamed in her eyes. When I paiited with her, it was with the affection of a   brother anid sister rather than that of almost strangers as we were! "To-night I serenaded her, Giberto. And she rewarded my devotion with this rose, which she threw from the balcony." Here the lover drew from his bosom the token and pressed it to his lips. ' Now, my good friend Giberto, I have made thee my father confessor, because I have seen that.'you listen well. I may need assist- ance in this sweet affair, and now that you are informed of everything, I can call on you if I need any second person as confidant; and love- affairs, you know, can't always be carried on alone. If I have to trust anybody, you are the best man for me to confide in." "I am at your service with tongue and sword, pistol or pistolet, gun or gold, senor capitan," answered Giberto with emphasis. "Here is my hand!" Clifford returned the frendly grasp, and said: "If I need you, it is fistt to ascertain all that you can about the family ofhpon Garcia and the cause of his exile. I wouldkNnow more before I would make an alliance that might not exactly be proper for an American officer, whole name and honor is his all. Don Garcia seems a noble gentleman, but I would know if he has borne an untarnished name; for the lady I make my bride-though she be as beautiful as Donna Ger-   trude is-must inherit no stain. But this is m confidence between us, Giberto." "You are discreet, capitan. Every gentleman should guard his own honor; and so, then, you think that you must seek the hand of the lady ." ( I shall be wretched, if I learn that any grave I offence of the father will put a bar to my seeking her as my wife." "Then I hope there will be no obstacle, senor. I fancy nothing beyond political opinions." "I trust not. 'But not many years since a no- ble of Spain arrived in this very city with two daughters and a son, all three highly accom- plished. It was said that he left his country only for political offences. He was courted and distinguished. His daughters married wealthy planters and their son was betrothed to one of I the fairest and highest-born of our maidens, 1 when it came out that the noble had poisoned his wife, and that these three children were the illegitimate offspring of a wicked and beautiful woman, for whose illicit love he had put his wife to death; and for this crime he had been ban- ished. Therefore, one should be prudent." "Just so," gravely answered the artillery-man. He would have added more, but the voices of two men beneath the window caught his ear and arrested his tongue. ,.   CHAPTER VI. A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER   WHEN,Gibert9 had satisfied himself that there were listeners beneath the window, conversing in a low and suppressed tone, he very softly opened the shutter and looked down. Clifford, at this moment, rose to go, saying: "It is no doubt the watchman. It is time I left you to your repose." "Hush, senor!- I see them and hear them. They are a -cavalier and his man, by their ap- pearance. They speak-listen!" "He must have entered hereabouts," said the voice of Tito. "I saw him come down this street and suddenly disappear. There is a light above our heads; let us knock and ask." "No,not so," said the Castilian.: "If he is not found to-night, he will be to-morrow. Let us return to our vessel. I can easily ascertain where he is in the morning." "Ah, but senor, you must not think of killing him; leave me something to do." "The malditos!" ejaculated Giberto. "Dost hear, Senor Clifford? They are plotting assas- sination of some one I Thou shalt not go forth; it may be thee l" "Nay, I have-no dread, Giberto; no man is my foe in the city, that I know of. These men seem to be talking, if I heard distinctly, about some one who has injured -both master and man. That is not I, for I never laid eyes on the rogues.   Good night. My going out may keep them from doing some one a mischief; for on seeing me appear, they will take themselves off." "Nay, then, I will accompany thee, if thou wilt go," answered the old soldier." "Keep thy house, brave Giberto. It is time thou wert in bed. I fear no danger from any man. Good night. When thou next seest this Cuban servant, thou wilt put such questions to him as will give me more knowledge'than I now possess, touching Don Garcia and his fair daughter." Thus speaking, Clifford descended the narrow stairs which led to the shop below. Giberto took down his artillery sword, put on his cap, and went with him. As he was unbarring the door, they heard the feet of the two men outside quickly retiring. "But thou shalt not stir with me," protested the cavalry officer. "( Go in and go to bed," he said, seeing that the old Mexican was armed to go with him, "Be it so. I will stand here till thou hast passed those two assassins." "Adios, amigo," said Clifford, gaily. "Va usted con Dios, senor capitan," respond- ed Giberto. "If thou wilt call to-morrow eve- ning, I will perhaps have further news for thee." Captain Clifford then left the- doOr edp ased   down the street. His way lay in the direction in which he saw before him the two men. They had stopped about thirty yards ahead, and seemed to be watching to see who he might prove to be. Clifford was too brave a man to be turned from his onward path by any feeling of personal fear. He, therefore, walked on though he could not conceal from himself some apprehensions of mischief from men who had been overheard plotting assassination. "It is he, Tito! The saints be praised!" whispered the Spaniard, as he placed his hands on the hilt of an elegant and superbly mounted nautical cutlass that hung at his side. "Now keep back, and let me have my work on him. I brook no rivals in my loves, and he who dares cross my path must prepare to die I Wilt thou keep back, and leave off this nervous fingering of thy dagger's hilt. By the mass! if thou strike him first, I -will spit thee as I would a hare!" Tito drew back muttering, yet with his hand fast hold of his dagger. Captain Clifford drew close to them, and as the pave was narrow, and almost taken up by the two men, he moved to pass on the inner side, as there was more space. Their attitude seemed so menacing that he placed his hand upon his pistol and half drew it from his belt, and keeping his eye upon them, he was going by, when the Spaniard by a side movement placed himself exactly before him. "Defend yourself, senor capitan!" "For what? Who are you, that thus chal- lenges me? -Give back, and let me pass!" cried Clifford, indlgnqntly, and he levelled his pistol at his. breast. But Tito sprang in and struck it up, so :that it went off, the ball grazing the cheek of the Spaniard. "Shall Istrike him, senor?" asked Tito, as he bared his shining dagger. "On thy life, no I He is mine," answered his master. "Captain Clifford, you are my rival! Dost thou know what I mean. He who crosses my path in love, dies!" As he spoke, he aimed a blow at the head of Clifford, who being without a sword, parried it with the barrel of the pistol; and he would have succeeded in disarming his antagonist but for the active vengeance of Tito, who seeing that his master was in danger, directed his steel towards the heart of the young officer with all the phren- sy of vengeance, yelling out as he struck: "This for my master!"  .    , , Clifford would have been struck dead by t4e assasin,.butfor the timely interference of Gi-'   berto, who had run up with his sword the mo- ment he saw Clifford stopped, and got to the scene of the rencontre just in time to strike down the steel of the Mexican; but this interference was not wholly successful, for it glanced into his side and passed between the ribs, inflicting a grievous wound. Clifford reeled against the wall, and Giberto, seeing that he was wounded, brought his sword down at the head of Tito with a sweep thatwould have cleft his skull, if he had not anticipated it, and jumped lightly to one side. The stout artilleryman then attacked the Spaniard, who showed no disposition to avoid the combat, and for half a dozen passes their swords clashed and emitted sparks in the fiercest manner. Both were, however, perfect masters of their weapons; but -the strength and skill of Giberto being aided by his grief and rage at see- ing Clifford sink to the pavement from loss of blood, he pressed his adversary so closely that he would have disabled him, or pushed him to retire from the battle, if Tito had not come to his aid, and so worried the old soldier by trying to stab him in the back, that he withdrew from, the combat to look after his young friend, saying: "Go for this time, vilanos! Another time we may give you a better fight.'1 The Spaniard made no reply, bnt putting up his sword, called Tito to follow. The latter, however, lingered as if he would either take an opportunity to complete-his work upon the body of the American officer, or watch the issue of his blow. "Wilt thou not comeffellow?" demanded his master. "Thou wilt have thy head split in two by that gray moustache's iron sword, a weapon that weighs not a pound less than twelve. One would think he fancied himself a blacksmith beating on at anvil.  That fellow would'be worth his weight in gold in my vessel. Wilt thou not come ." Tito at length came to his master, and said: "I have been looking closely. That man is my mother's brother 1" "What man?" "He who came so near splitting my head! I know him well. He was a brave sergeant in the artillery at home. I thought he had been dead 1 It is he. What the deuce brought him here I I would as lief have seen the devil!" "You speak as if you were afraid of him." "I am, senor: I sweat now at having seen him I! By the beards of all the popes, I would rather the wide gulf lay between me and him!"   "It may, as soon as I have done my errand here. Come on  The affair hath brought the gend'armes to this quarter. Let us turn up this street to avoid answering any awkward ques- tions. This Captain Clifford will not be likely to stand in my way after this." "It was my good blow, senor." "Thy dagger has for once done me good ser- vice. I forgive thee the blow, Tito." "I would I knew what my fierce uncle Giberto, the artilleryman, doth here?" "His presence troubleth thee, hombre I I ne'er knew thee show fear of man before." "I have my reasons, my good reasons, senor ;" answered Tito. "Senor, wilt thou excuse me, and let me go back and see where he dwells." "No. Thou wilt be seized by the gend'armes. Dost thou not see that we have need to keep our way along quietly and rapidly, and separate our- selves as far as possible from the spot?" Tito moved on after the Spaniard, and they soon were lost to the eye in the shadow of the governor's house, on the Plaza Grande. Leav- ing them to pursue their way towards the quay, we will return to Clifford. The wound he had received bled so freely that he sunk down, and would have fainted, but that he succeeded in stopping the flow of blood by pressing his hand over the wound, till Giberto, finding that he could not slay the stranger, and was like to be killed himself, returned to his aid. "They have done for me, for a while, Giberto," said the officer. "It was a strong blow, and but for thy ready arm would-have finished me. The fellow struck like a hired assassin." "No doubt he was, my senor capitan. The maldito strikes for all the world like my villan. ous nephew, Tito; and by the rood, had I not seen him shot through the head and left for dead -in a street brawl, I should swear this one was he. I hope thou art not so badly hurt!" "The hilt struck me, and may produce the   pain more than any depth of wound," answered Clifford. "SVanst thou reach my house, senor?" "I trust so. There; let me lean on thy broad shoulder thus!" "Canst thou walk?" "I will manage to do so. It is not far V" "But a few paces. Nay, I will take thee up in my arms I Ho, gend'armes 1" he cried, as he saw two of the city guard running down towards them. "Help I Haste to aid me'carry this ca- ballero to my shop I and one of you run for a surgeon 1" "What hath been done? Ah, is it thou, friend Giberto! Who hath struck this blow?" said one of the guards. "Two assassins, who are hardly out of sight. One of you pursue, and also send a doctor; and you, Pierre, help me bear this gentleman." One of the guards at once pressed forward in pursuit, giving the alarm, and the other, lifting Clifford, who proved unable to walk, bore him to the humble domicil of the artilleryman. In a few moments, three of our guards, drawn thither by the noise of the discharged pistol, crowded into, Giberto's little shop, and when they had heard the report of the events which had taken place, they joined in pursuit of the two men, whose description Giberto gave them. A surgeon soon made his appearance, sent by the first gend'arme. Upon examining the wound, he pronounced it by no means fatal, as the dag- ger had passed between the ribs and out at the back, but without touching any vital part. He said, however, after he had dressed it, that it would be necessary for his patient to remain per. fectly quiet several days, and in a month he might be quite well again. Captain Clifford heard this decision with a sigh, as he thought how completely this confine- ment would shut him out from the presence of Dona Gertrude.   CHAPTER VIII. THB PURSUIT. ESCAPE TO THE VESSEL.   WE will now return to the two persons whom we left crossing the Plaza in the direction of the water. They walked ongith rapid steps, for the alarm increased behind jthem; and they might any moment be confrontedby some of the %ity guard meeting them. Upon reaching the levee, upon the broad es- planade of which the bright moon shone almost like noonday, the Spaniard paused, and looked keenly along the shore, up and down, as if he were uncertain of his locality, aqd were in search of some object. "Are we right, Tito? This cannot be the place where we landed." "Si, senor Do you not remember this ca- talpa tree with the broken limb hanging down. It was directly opposite this." "But I see no boat!" "It may have moved firther down 1" "-No-there is Rodrigo coming from the shad- ow of that tree. Well, the boat, why is it moved?" he asked, of the man who came near. "A watch was posted directly where I landed you, senor, and so I ordered the barge to row down further, while I remained here to let you know of it!" "You did right. Lead me at once to it! We are pursued!" "This way, senor," answered the man; and   leading' the way he moved rapidly down the levee, and in a few minutes they saw the boat, with four men seated in it, lying on their oars. "Now we are safe, senor," said Tito. But hardly had the words escaped his lips, than a party of five gend'armes made their ap- pearance round the iron enclosure of the Plaza, not fifty yards distant, and came upon the full run towards them, the moonlight glistening upon the pistols they held in their hands. "That does not look like safety, Tito!" said the captain. "Spring on shore two of you with your cutlasses, to our aid, and two remain- to shove off the boat at my word!" he cried, see- ing that the gend'armes were too near for him to escape into the boat without a fight with his pursuers. Seeing the two men come to his as- sistance, and beholding five armed and resolute- looking men opposed to them, the guard stopped when within ten paces, and drew up in battle array. The leader then spoke, and said: "Surrender; for you will be overpowered by numbers!" "Surrender for what "   coolly asked the Spaniard. "For assaulting a man! Are you not the two men that stabbed an American officer?" "Two? Seest thou not we are five 3 Where ,hast thou learned thy arithmetic, man? If    seek two men, thou wilt have to go further. Cannot quiet citizens embark in a boat at night without being taken for assassins? Go back, and send shrewder fellows than ye seem to be, after, your two escapades I Come, my men, let us to our boat, and not detain these gentlemen in conversation, seeing they are in pursuit of two assassins!" With these words, he walked to his boat; the men followed, and giving the order to shove off, they were six -fathoms from the bank before the gend'armes, who had been confounded by his coolness, could recover from their stupor, and make up their minds whether they ought to have let him escape till they had better proof than his words that he was not one of the persons they were in pursuit of. "' Sacre!" growled one, "I believe he is the man, and that we are fine sottistes.   "Parbleu!" ejaculated a second, " he has cool- ness enough to be a grand villain." "Be jabbers!" said a third, who was evidently from Hibernia, "it's the man, I'm shure; but then there's five o' them, and divil tacks me i five is two, even if they are the two same!" "I saw two join a third, and then two more come from the boat," said another;. " and it is my opinion we have been fooled, and that our two men are among the five in; that boat!" "Then let us fire into it!" cried two or three, running towards the water-side. "Hold, you may kill the wrong birds I It wont do! They are out of pistol shot, too, by this time  Let them go I It is better for our credit, that it shouldn't be suspected at the guard-house that we even imagined the two men could form a portion of this party." "Och, it's the long head he has I He's right, lads," answered the Irishman; " we'll niver let on we believed the two spalpeens had been seen by us, at all at all 1" With this worldly policy decided upon, the gend'armes remained a few moments, following the retiring boat with their eyes. They saw it take a direction obliquely across the broad, shin- ing bosom of the river, and was finally lost to their gaze in the splendor of the moon's wake, reflected dazzlingly upon the surface. "I have had a narrow escape from arrest," said the Spaniard, speaking to the young man, whom he called Rodrigo, and who steered, the boat, as it glided swiftly down the stream, but obliquely, towards the opposite bank. "It would seem, 80o senor capitan," answered   the person addressed. "I hope that it is noth- ing grave." "No-a mere street affair. As t have not been recognized so as to be identified to-morrow, I shall not fear going up to the city again." As he spoke, he cast his eyes in the direction of the metropolis, which lay in vast masses of irregular architecture along the shore for a league, its front fringed by the tall masts of a hundred ships, and herd and there a light spark- ling amid the shadows. The deep-mourned toll- ing of a bell now came to their ears, across the water. "It is three o'clock," said the Spaniard. "We have consumed the night nearly. Do you see the brigantine?" he asked, peering ahead, through the shining mist, that was rising from the bosom of the river. "There she rides at her anchor, senor," an swered Rodrigo, pointing to two slender masts, faintly visible, springing from a low hull, that was nearly blended with the dark line of the shore. In a- few minutes the boat came close to the vessel, which proved to be ahermaphroditebrig, her topsails loose, and ready to sheet home, her jib and spanker set, riding at a single anchor, about fifty fathoms from the bank. "Quien va?" came with a sharp hail to their ears from the brigantine's quarter-deck. "El capitan," answered Rodrigo. "Bueno," was the response; "a bordo." The boat pulled alongside, and then it could be seen that the mouths of cannon projected from open ports, and the vessel was a heavily armed and formidable looking craft. There were no lights visible, but the moon shone brightly upon her decks, revealing, as the party mounted the ladder and stepped down upon them, the neat and-glittering armament of a war- vessel, and full twoscore men to make the arma- ment available. "You have been gone so long, capitan, we feared some mischief had happened," said a man in a Spanish naval uniform, who was sec- ond in command; " and so I loosed the topsails and hove short, and got all ready for a flight, if you should be chased down upon us." "Fe have been chased on the land, but not on the water,", answered the Spaniard. "I Ha all been quiet ."            - " Yes sir; no one has shown  any curiosity about us." "That is well. Where is Guido Y"   "He is below, sir; but not sleeping; for he has been all the night on deck, enjoying the moonlight, and listening to the various sounds from the city. What news there, senor'?" "Nothing. I shall probably remain here three or four days. But after I see Guido, I will give you your orders; for it wont do to remain until dawn, or the custom-house boats will be inquisi- tive." Thus speaking,' the Spaniard, who was evi- dently the captain of the warlike vessel so secret- ly anchored under the point of land below the city, made his way aft, and descended into the cabin. This was a richly furnished apartment, hung with silken tapestry, set with mirrors, and made luxurious with ottomans running around it. A costly Turkish carpet covered the floor, and overhead hung a rich lamp, which cast a soft, dreamy light over the whole. There were two doors to this sumptuous nautical boudoir, one of which opened into an inner cabin; and as it was half open, it could be discovered that it was in all respects as beautiful as the larger and outer one. The second door was closed, as the captain descended; but he had no sooner removed his cap, and thrown himself with an air of great fatigue upon one of the ottomans, than it opened, and a handsome youth, not above twenty years of age, came out, smiling wel- come.    "I am rejoiced to see you back again, uncle Conrado," he said, laying his hand in his. "I had feared that you might have got into diffi- culties, and I could hardly restrain the impulse to take another boat and go in search of you. And have you succeeded? Is she in the city?" "Sit and listen, Guido, and you shall hear all," answered his uncle, who, with his cap and cloak off, displayed a large, manly figure, mould- ed like a Hercules in its combinations of strength and beauty; while his face, now fully revealed, proved eminently handsome-that is, for a man of forty, whose hair and mustache were mingled with gray. Altogether, his appearance was striking and marked-; but the expression of his face was cold and worldly, sinister and artful.' He looked like a man whose desires knew no obstacle to their accomplishment-not even blood. His dark eyes were cold and piercing i his mouth, expressive of pride and' sensuality; his smile, treacherous, yet winning. The contrast between the uncle and nephew, was quite as great as the difference between their years. The nephew was a perfect Narcissus for   youthful graces. He was elegantly shaped, and the green silk dressing-gown which he wore, tied about his waist by a crimson sash, displayed the harmonious outlines of his figure with sym- metrical effect. His height was equal to that of Don Conrado's, but so just proportioned, that it seemed less. His hair, which was left to wave on his neck in natural tresses, was that chevelure wdor, which delighted the pencils of Raphael and Vandyke to imitate, a glorious commingling of brown and golden light all over it. His brows were of the same rich brown of gold tint; his eyes large and proudly bright, were also brown, shaded by auburn lashes, in long, curving fringes. His face was oval-not unlike in shape and beauty that which portraitors represent that of Edward VI, England's youthful monarch; and the face of this youth was princely. His profile was like that of the Greek Apollo, with the grace of a woman's, and the loftiness of a man's. His complexion was olive, and the superbly cut mouth, which was formed to betray exquisitely every emotion of pride or feeling, was shaded by a dark brown mustache. The captain of the brigantine seemed to re- gard him with admiration, as if he wondered at his noble beauty, as he seated himself with an air of graceful ease, opposite to him. "By our lady, Guido, you are too handsome for a cavalier; your face and hair would kill with envy half. the beauties of Orleans, should it be their misfortune to see you." "If I had been consulted, I should have en- dowed myself less liberally with attributes that would rather please a maiden than a young man, who has to win by his sword or his pencil," answered Guido, with a smile, and -slightly col- oring. "Methinks I would like a right earnest cut of a cutlass across my face, so that it would give me a more manly air!" "Not so, nephew!   You are manly enough, with all your beauty! Ye gods 1 I have seen your eyes flash, your nostrils quiver, and your whole frame dilated like Mars in battle! That is what amazes me, to see so much lion-like courage united with such maidenly charms." "You mock, uncle!" "No, by the rood I But I see we shall quar- rel, and I would as lief rouse a lion as thy high spirit, Guido. So to my night's adventure I I have seen her!" "I rejoice with you. And did she receive you less coldly than before?"        I '"I did not speak with her. That is yet to   come. But thou weft never in love, and wilt care little to hear what I have to say;" "Iean sympathize; nevertheless, uncle. Tell me all. I would hear how this haughty lady treats thee! And I have curiosity to see'her, also, that I may with my own eyes witness if thy large commendations of her are near the truth." "Thou shalt behold her, and soon." "Then I am to go up to the city?" "No, she is to come to the brigantine."  ".Will she of her free will?" ":With her free will, or without her free will, she shall yet grace this cabin with her presence, Guido," answered Don Conrado, with a frown.. "It is my time to play the tyrant, now that I have the power. She has had her play, arid now comes the game into my hands. I did not see her to speak to her. Tito, whom I sent, u from the English bend, two days ago, in advance of our vessel's approach to the city, reported cor- rectly to me. The house which' he discovred; was that of Don Garcia de Armas. So imme- diately upon my landing, to-night, I made mniy way there to reconnoitre, preparato-y to taking further steps to see her and lay my'suit once more at her feet!" "Well, uncle?" "Well,; it would seem'that the very Sathairas himself is against me in this love-matter.' Whtle I was surveying the outside of the, house, 'whi'chi is as strong as a castle, an Americat officer comes up, stops beneath kler balcony, and serenades her with words of the most impassioned language.' "Then she is, doubtless, beloved by him!" "Por peste! You mention it as coolly as if it were the lightest thing in the world, that I, after sailing across the sea to throw myself at the feet of the -only woman I ever loved--should find'her the inamorata of a young and dashing cavalry  officer.' It is plain, boy, you were never in love." "Never, uncle!" answered-Guido, quietly. "One of these days you will know how to feel- for me!  I am yet a young man' I I am  ot too old for a, maiden of nineteen! There is 'no rea- son why she should not at the first have accepted e my   hand! But she shall take it now, with all its stains! I  found this new lover serenading her. So   I swore in my heart his destruction i s but not until she threw him a bouquet, tied with l her hair, and enclosing a' note. This was more f than I  could' bear; but I have the note anfd tress ] here!- - e carried off the flower l"   M As Don Conrado spoke,;he placed 'oii'the in,  3   t laid India table, before Guido, the'pale'r and lock of hair. He read the one, and exam/iied I the other with admiring interest.' "It il dark as the wigri of the raven, tincle ' , and it is soft as the down of the ermnine, 'while' f it is as glossy as the silk of Floren'e! it is ex- B ceedingly beautiful hlair. It must be a lovely neck, cheek and browy that such shininig drapery' as this shades and beautifies!" "No words, nephew, can describe her loveli- ness!'" "Ibegin to have some curiosity to see her!" "If the fates prosper me thou shalt not live many days longer with thy curiosity being unsat- isfied. Having picked up these trophies, which I escaped the serenader's eye, I pursued him, and r at length encountered him; but a fighting old , fellow came out of a house near by, to his aid, and I did well to get oif withoui being slain; 'as F it was, hei'has ruinedmy cutlass with; gashe'ahn half ell deep. The officer was ariied only with a pistol, with -which: he would hav6 killed me; but Tito turnedit aside. He then stabbed him, and we retired, having, I doubt not, put ari' end' to any more serenadings from that quartetr; for the officer fell from loss of blood. It was with difficulty we got off, as We were pursued by the%' gend'armes; but I maiiiEed to embarlin' safety, aidl'*get away frotn the 'city. Thus you hive the history of my nigit's adventure. It has re- sulted in discoveringf to m'e tti'certainty of Doia  Gertrude's beirig in' tig citj;'and in putting out' of the way a rival." "I trust the lover is nrot'slain," said Guido. "It matters riot. It will keep him out of the6; waey till' I can' manage my affair."  "And how do you expect to procebed Y" ' "Ii this waiy. ' I shall try and obtain ari in- terview with the haughty beauty, and even beg her" favor, if need be, for'he'who stoops, mnay only stoop to conquer. I will urge riy'suit with all-the eloquence in my power; and: my deep love for her will give'me Words of fire!" "If she be not melted' by them, what then will you do, uncle?" asked the nephew; who was engaged in idly tsiarpiiting a craydniin'a golden porte-crayon.   '     ' I    I "I shall then change 'ymodedof attack. If she will not be won 'with"lve, she slial be wnri by strategy  and power. I'have n6t coine thu:- far, Guide, to ,amhuse myBelf. 'II have S*O6rn that" I will not leave New Orleans without the lady, won fairly" or Wri" foully; andid " will abide 'm: OQ  i * " }*      'E i* o" ' ,fH tl : t'   "How  will you obtain possession of her, uncle ." "That remains to be seen--that must be thought about. The house is strong, and may not easily be entered. But then I will think of that after having had an interview with her P!" "And this interview will take place to-mor- row or the next day."   "Will you go up to the city with me, or re- main on board? I shall leave the vessel before- day, and send her down to await intelligence from me, below the English Turn, some eight leagues below the city." "I will go to the city with you, uncle; I have a desire to see it." "Then let us to the deck."   CHAPTER IX. A- NEW ENTERPRISE.   WHEN Don Conrado reached the deck, the faint blush of dawn was flushing the east. Guido, having exchanged his robe-de-chambre for the becoming costume of a young Castilian gentle- man, shortly appeared. Don Conrado then pro- ceeded to give his orders to his lieutenant, Ran- dolpho: "As soon as we leave the vessel, you will weigh anchor and drop down the river a few hours until you come to the villa of M. La --, where I stopped when ascending. Then you will anchor half a cable's length from the land and allow no communication whatever, either with the shore, or any craft, or boats in the riv- er; and especially keep watchful against any boats approaching you from the city during the night; for I may-get into trouble, and be be- trayed, and an expedition sent to take you. Keep the guns shotted and arms ready; cable stopped so as to be slipped if need be; and ev- erything prepared for sudden flight." "Si, senor capitano, you shall be obeyed," answered the lieutenant, with nautical brevity. "I may be absent a week-perhaps longer- and it is possible you may see me in three days. Act as if you expected me every hour." "Si, senor capitano." *   The cutter was now brought alongside; and Tito, having previously placed in it the port- manteau belonging to the captain, his master, and Guido, they descended into it. Four men selected out of the crew for their courage and coolness rowed the boat, and lRodrigo took his place in the stern sheets to steer her, while the captain and his nephew took opposite cushions. 'Now mark well my commands, Lieutenant   Randolpho," said the captain, as the boat shot away from the armed sides of the brigantine, and took its course up the river close in with the shadows of the shore. "We will keep up this bank, Rodrigo, until we get higher than the city, and then cross to the quay at the foot of Rue Poydras. There the boat can be concealed beneath the pier among the fishing boats, says Jean the boatswain, who knows the city, without attracting attention. You and the men will take lodgings near in one of the Italian cafes, but always one of you must be found on watch near the boat." "And where, shall we go on reaching the quay?" asked Guido.           I "To the cafe of Loupe de Blase! We will remain there until our plans are matured. We can trust him!" The tall masts of the brigantine faded into the gray mist of morning, and soon they saw her under sail and moving down till she was lost to their gaze. - The day grew clearer each moment,.and one after another the streets of the city opened upon their sight as they pulled up the stream. The buildings that were highest caught the morning beams, which glowed like burnished gold from the dome of the St. Charles and the pyramidal towers of St. Patrick; and soon. the more humble towers and turrets and battlemented roofs shone with the sunlight. MBy this time theywere two miles above the point where they had left the brigantine. .The sounds of the city, which as the day broke came across the water to their ears one by one, were now increased to a confused roar of iron wheels rolling over the granite pavements. of the re-   sounding streets. Even the murmur of voices was borne to them sounding like distant hum of bees. - The long tiers of dark-hulled and tall- masted ships, the squadrons of steamers, the small fleet of coasting craft each arranged in its proper place along the crescent sweep of the shore, came in sight one after the other. With the rising sun a thousand flags of every nation draped the spars and staffs of the shipping; and from a small American sloop-of-war at anchor in the river, came the blue smoke and sharp re- port of the morning gun From thel tower of the cathedral swelled musically upon the breeze the matin bell, its deep and sacred tones ming- ling with every other sound as if to sanctify the, whole. At least suchr was the thought that passed through the mind of Guido as he listened and gazed with deep pleasure at all the varying features of' the scene. Don Conrado, however, slept reclined at length upon the crimson cush- ions of his boat, overcome by his vigils and fa- tigues of the sleepless night he had passed. At length the boat gained a point above the Marine Hospital, and Rodrigo directed her course into the stream to cross over to the city. -As he did so, Guido observed a spy-glass lev- elled at them from the gangway of the sloop-of- war. "The quartermaster taking his observations, senor. It means nothing about us," answered the young seaman. Their course was crossed and re-crossed con- tinually by fishing-boats, ships' yawls, shore- boats, drift-wood skiffs with their single occu- pants. At length they reached the quay and run the boat in among a fleet of threescore, or more. Conrado now awaked and seeing that they were at the land, gave further directions about the disposition of the boat; and then fol- lowed by Tito, the two cabelleros made their way along the quay until, after turning two or three corners, they found themselves at the en- trance of a cafe of modest pretensions in the French quarter of the city. There were two doors, one more private apparently than the other, and which led by a few stairs to a hand- some room   in the rear. Tito who went in ad- vance and seemed to know the place, having led the way-to this room, so as not to pass through the public coffee-ronm, disappeared for an in- stant, leaving them seated at a' marble' table which was marked with the impress of wine- goblets, and  beneath which lay two' or three of the  handsome  Mexican  cacrd'which the'   5 American soldiers introduced into their own f land. "This place is quiet and secluded. It suits my purpose, as I have no desire to be known abroad," said Don Conrado, as he lounged wear- ily upon a fauteuil. At this instant Tito returned, followed by a darl, full-faced Frenchman, whose black brows I seemed to hang habitually over his eyes, as if ' with the desire to conceal the wickedness of their ordinary expression. He, therefore, looked F at you through a sort of cheveux-de-frise of bristles like a lion glaring at you through the bars of his cage. He had a villanous turn-up nose, a wiry mustache, a scar on his left cheek, and another sad one across the right corner of his mouth, the length of his finger, as if it had been done with a dragoon's cutlass. His hair was cut short to his square-topped head like a recently discharged convict, and his whole aspect was that of a man who had lived a bad life, and whose hand was familiar with crime. He now  wore a white apron appropriately dabbled with blood-that of a pullet, doubtless, which he had just been kill- ing-and a little blue cap that did not cover but a third of his huge head. Upon seeing his guests he stopped and looked hard a moment at Conrado, and, then, as if fully satisfied of his cognizance, he advanced, bowing and extending his hand: "Welcome, noble captain! I am proud of this honor."  "We seek your house, Loupe," answered the captain of the brigantine, without making any movement to rise from his reclining attitude to shake hands with his host, " to remain a few days as quietly as possible. I am glad to see you are doing so well. Getting richer here than by the old way, eh?" "Yes, senor capitan, money is plentier on the land than on the sea; and, besides, one isn't here constantly in danger of a crick in the neck. I hope you have been prosperous, senor?" "Was I ever known to be otherwise, man?" somewhat haughtily retorted Captain Conrado, as if he could not brook the. suspicion that the question 'implied. "How long hast thou been here q When Tito informed me he had stumbled on you keeping a cafe, I could hardly credit it. But I hope we  shalltfind thee as good at thy new trade as at thy old. Faugh, man, go and take off that blood-begrmined apron; it makes me think you have been doing murder, and come 'fresh from it thserveUBt."       :   "I will do as you please, senor; but I have done with such affairs now. I confess every month, and take the holy sacrament four times in a year; for I am a penitent man!"Here he held down his head and tried ineffectually to look as he fancied a saint should look. Conrado laughed slightly, and then with a wave of his hand, said, "Provide me a room! Serve me yourself. 'Make known to no one that you have such guests as we are. I would not court the public eye." "I understand, sir; I will see that your wish- es are all gratified. You have gold plenty, I doubt not!" "Ah, yes you shall be well paid. I see your piety has 'not diminished your love of money, Loupe; but this is an instinct and cannot be got rid :'of by confession like a manis sins. Hast thou good Bordea ux in thy casks '." "None better in the city, senor .capitau." "Brin a bottle o9r two, and, then, when thou canst free thyself from..thy duties come and let me talk with thee!" The host was then leaving his ,rxom, but with his gaze so intentlyfixed on Suido,that his uncle said : ".I forgot to tell thee who this is. It is my nephew, hIe will occupy my apartments with me." "Nay, with your permission, Uncle Conrado," ,said Guido, "I will leave you to your room without intrusion, and seek another cafe. It will,suit you better to be alone; -a nd my irregu- lar hours might annoy you!" "Do as thou wilt, Guido." "I can give the noble young gentlemana fair chamber .and good appointments, senor," said Loupe. "No," answered Guido, who conceived an ir- resistible repugnance to the host of the cafe, , I will ,seek quarters at the hotel St. Louis. When thou hast need of me thou wilt know where to' find me!" Thus speaking, he rose; and as Don' Conrado ma3,e no,eother objections than that he might nott be found when p st needed , he prepared to leave, propisieg to report himself three times a #qy$t the care, Loupe looked gloomily abee hnm as he departd followed by Tito with his valise. Vhen hee had gone, 'fter having delayed a moment to converse yin . low voice with his annel te latter seeip't,.t:thp e dor was .closed And Stit Loupe renone 4.still in. the room- sa4, in avoe between contSe^ ^   H^;st,   "How in the, name of all the devils, Loupe de Blase, do I find you here? I thought you had been in your own place down below there two years ago!" "It was after the capture of the schooner, senor, and so many of my comrades were shot and hanged that I thought Spain was too hot for me, and so I came across the sea in a Cadiz ship bound for this place." '"But I thought you were hanged?"1 "No, senor, I made my escape with the rope about my neck, by being so fortunate as to snatch a cutlass from an officer and cut my way through the crowd; but not you see without getting an ugly cut across my face. I leaped the cliff of the terrace into the seat and with my cutlass in my teeth, swimming ,to a fishing-boat on which a man and boy were engaged in catch- ing fish, whom I compelled to row me straight out to sea. As night soon came on, under cover of the darkness, I made them put back and land me on the coast. Thence I made my way to Cadiz; and,now, senor, you see me here keep- ing a quiet cafe, and getting along, in the world." ,',So it would seem."  "And if I may be so boid, senor capitan, how do I have the surprise of, seeing you in New* Orleans?" "I am  here on private affairs of my own, Loupe, and shall trouble you but a few days'" "As long as it may please you, senor capitan. This room is at your service to receive your friends in at twelve- pesos the week, and there is another in the rear, very private, at nine pesos the week, very handsomely furnished." And here the host opened the door and exhibited a small, .but, fine chamber. "They will do exactly, Loupe." "I am pleased to hear it. I would ask, senor, if you are still in the Spanish navy ." "Do not be inquisitive, Monsieur de Blase."1 "A thousand pardons, senor capitano. I am your humble servant." "And would cut my throat for two scudi!" "O, senor!" ' ',Leave me to myself; and when I need you, I will ringthis silver bell which I see here on hle Oable." The keeper of the cafe bowed and quitted the apartment. After he ha,ldisappeared,-the cap- tain of the brigantine paced the room several times up and down as if in deep thought-as if the presence,of this man had cilled up, the past, Igp tcistl-JT.   CHAPTER X. THE WOUNDED OFFICER.--DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE,   Ir the small Cupper room where we saw Clif- ford and,the soldier seated the night previous, the American officer, now lay stretched upon a cot, almost unable to move from the severity with which he had been wounded. As it became necessary for Giberto to look after his shop and customers below,. Clifford. was left alone; but, as he had only to be quiet and suffer, it was but little moment whether he had company all the time or not; but the interest felt in him by the old soldier was sogreat, that every ten minutes he would, run up stairs to ask how he was, or if he could do anything for him. As ,the young American, in one of these intervals, was think- ing about his misfortune in being so long. ikely to be deprived of the sight of Donna Gertrude, he heard Giberto salute with unusual cordi ality some one who entered his,shop. "Ah, good morniog, ,amigo! j am  glad to see you I How is Don Garciato-day?" "He is well, senor Giberto, and. wishes you to take -this roll of tobacco and make him two box- es,of the ,same sort of cigartos that you made last." "Excelente1 I will do it. Whien shall you want them ." "Two dozen of them by night, and the rest at your leisure, this or next week." H"His comrmsns shall be obeyed, Hlwa you,   heard the news,senor?" added the soldier to the servant of Don Garcia. "Nothing bad, I hope, senor Giberto?" "A sad misfortune  There lies up stairs an American officer wounded by an assassin near my door, last night!" "An American officer  Do you know his name?" "Captain Clifford-the bravest man that ever drew steel." - "It is the same, then I I hope he, is not dan- gerous; for he isa friend of Don Garcia. Last night he serenaded la senorita. It must [have been on his why home. When did it happen?" "About half past twelve." "That would be about the hour. I shall be the bearer of sad news, for thisI officer has of late been a frequent guest at our house. Tell me how he is that I may answer, such questions ,as they may put to me, and how it happened V' ';He was attacked by two men-one who looked like a cavalier-about twenty yards from my shop; :and would have been, ssassinated but for my aid. As it was, he, received an ugly wound with a daggerrunader the right side, from which he bled freely. I had him conveyed at -once up sttirsi Weren he now lies. He has had a good surgeon, and is doing well." l Sme other customs, now coming in,thhy. n   versation ceased, and the Cuban took his leave of him. "Now," said Clifford to himself, "I shall know whether Donna Gertrude cares for me. If she feels a tithe the passion that burns in my breast for her, I shall hear from her before many hours. This sweet hope made him forget his sufferings, so that Giberto when, at length, he could leave his shop to visit him, seeing the cheerful expression of his face, expressed his surprise. He then made known the visit of Don Garcia's servant, and his believing that Don Garcia would send to see how he was, if not come himself. Donna Gertrudis, or Gertrude-for the name is either in the Spanish-was in her boudoir en- gaged at her harp in practising a piece of music that Edward Clifford had composed and pre- sented her, and which they had sung together. She would sing a few bars, and then pause with her fingers lingering upon the harp, as if forget- ting her task, and indulging the more pleasura- ble thoughts of the donor. The soft, dreamy eye, the deep-breathing bosom, the expression of tender sentiment that played about her mouth, all betrayed her love for him who occupied her thoughts. Suddenly her reveries were interrupted by the entrance of her father. His face wore an ex- pression of ill news; and her cheek paled in an- ticipation of some sad tale.. She could not speak to ask what he bore to her upon his hesi- tating tongue. "Ah, my child!   This is heavy news! Such a noble gentleman, too 1" "Who? not-?" "Captain Clifford has been assassinated!" "The words went like lightning to her heart, She'uttered a wild shriek, and would have fallen, but he caught her, adding quickly: "I don't mean he has been killed, but only wounded; and   not fatally--not fatally-did I not understand you so, Gaspar?" "Si, senor. He will recover." "Thank the blessed saints for those words Gaspar?" she said, trying to rally. "Tell me all?  Where did you hear this?" she asked, with -an earnestness that plainly told Don Gar- cia the secret of her love. "In the shop where he lies?" "Shop i?" "Si, senorita I He was taken "to the shop of senor Giberto who makes cigars, where he has had a  surgeon and is doing well. I am. assured   by Giberto that he need not be in bed more than three weeks." "Poor Edward! I fear that it is worse than you say. How did it happen?" "It was the work of two assassins; and but for -Giberto, who heard the contest-for he de- fended himself bravely-he would have been killed!" "Good Giberto! He shall not go unreward- ed," said Gertrude, warmly. "Where is the shop i" "Nay, daughter, you must not go," said her father, seeing her lay her hand upon her man- tilla. "And wherefore, my dear father? He has been our guest; he is our friend! He is in a poor fabricator's shop; he can have no comforts! Will you go and have, him removed hither.? Here we can nurse him till he recovers!" Don Garcia was silent. He regarded his daughter's enthusiasm with surprise. He little dreamed that the American soldier had inspired in her heart so profound and earnest a passion. He reflected a moment whether he should try to repress it, or let her continue to love the young officer. He at once came to a resolution that it would be in vain to oppose it, and that he would not attempt to do so; but he regretted that she should have loved unknown to him, when in a former caselshe had refused to give her heart where he had wished her to give her hand. "It matters not," he reflected;." there is no prospect now of her union with Don Conrado de Beltrati, and I will not, out of revenge on E her, oppose this current of her affection; for the American officer, if he lives, will be an honora- ble match for her. A woman's heart where it I takes a bent can never be turned another way. The young man is worthy of our regard, and I will yield to her wishes, and, besides, on his recovery, I may prevail on him to give his sword to our cause." "Father, you hesitate." "No.   He shall be removed hither and be our guest till his recovery. Gaspar, you will have a room ready for him." Gertrude placed her arm about her father's neck and kissed him with affectionate gratitude. "Why, my child, this is a great discovery I have made," he said, half tenderly, half in re- proof." "Sir?" "That you love this young officer. I never suspected this."   She held her head down and blushed; for in her anxiety for her wounded lover, she did not reflect that she was laying open to her father's eye the secret of her bosom. "It is true, sir," she said, ingenuously. "You loved not where I would have had you love, child; and now you have given your whole heart where you did not know that I should be willing you should give your hand." "I did not think of loving him, sir, at first. It stole upon me insensibly. But now that you know it, I will not try to disguise it." "And are you sure that he honors your love, my daughter? Are you sure that he loves you in return? Thou should'st have been sure of this before you betrayed to him the state of your own heart." For a moment, the lovely senorita was discon- certed by these inquiries, directed as they evi- dently were, by parental prudence, and her face was suffused with a slight blush of maiden em- barrassment; but instantly recovering her com- posure, she replied with a frank simplicity and artlessness that were characteristic: "He loved first, dear father! It was the dis- covery of his ardent and delicate devotion to me, that awakenel gratitude in my own heart!" "Ah, that Don Conrado's attentions, my child, had awakened gratitude ." "Awakened rather contempt! Ah, my   dear father, you did not know that man's evil char- acter!" "He was a  brave officer-a man of the world; i he had won battles, and been rewarded by the t queen, and was rich and high in rank enough 1 to sit in the presence of princes " 1 "I  know it, sir! But I could not love him!" "Perhaps you thought him too old."    t "I was then but sixteen-three and a   half h years ago-I was too young, if he were not too old. But I   hated him, sirl I read his heart, t] sirl It was black! There was no truth nor h honor in him, sir I  O, sir, you do not know that t] man! Before you he wore a mask; but think- ing a  young girl, a child like me, could not read character, he was off his guard. I  trembled w whenever I  was in his presence "     of "Your dislike exaggerates his faults. I know he had spots 'on his character; but they were he not proved." "No, but they were true; all the world be: at lieved, which is worse thanw proof, where some doubt. The queen threatened to degrade him :from -the navy for robbing at sea a Tripolitan :if 'H;   in ship, and taking from it a million of gold that lot was on its way to Constantinople." r's  "It was only a rumor, child. The Tripolitan vessel was never heard'of after leaving port, and Don Conrado's being cruising in his frigate in )u .that quarter--" ur  "No, father, not in his frigate. He fitted out I a small Corsican schooner expressly, manned by desperadoes, in order to waylay this rich ship, it. which he had heard was to cross the seas about u that time. And it is said that he returned to Spain, and having enriched his crew, he dis- e, missed them, and set the vessel on fire on which ,u he had committed the piracy. It is well known, )f that but a few months before he lost his patri- ir mony at play, and that after the disappearance of the Tripolitan ship, he was known to redeem i- his estate and repair his castle, and have an i- abundance of gold to expend on his pleasures e and luxuries." "- "You give him a severe character, Gertrude. - You should not listen to such tales. I see now d why you refused his suit." "Nay, dear father, had I not known these - things about him, I could never have endured his presence. Therefore I treated him as I did. ' And, moreover, in Havana, before we left there,. I  heard a rumor that he had been dismissed from the navy, and had retired from Spain, no one r knew whither, in disgrace." "Upon my word, when a woman dislikes a man, what will she not teach her heart to believe about him I But let this pass. I see you feel too anxious about this officer who has been so happy, without an effort, to supplant Don Con. rado!" "Indeed, sir, I would rather think of him, than talk of the other! Gaspar, how will you get him removed here?" "  I fear it will be difficult, senora," answered the Cuban, respectfully. ," The fabricator said he could not be removed even to his hotel, and therefore remained there." "Is the man kind?" "  He seems to be attached to him. The man was, he told me, a  soldier in Mexico, and this officer saved his life there." "Then he is with a friend who will see that he needs no care. But I will-" Here she checked lherself in what she was about to utter; and added:     j, "  wish, dear father;,ou would visit him." "That I will do at once," he answered, ," and :if I  find he cau be removed hither, I will have him brought  . ." . . ,   '"Thanks, my generous and: forgiving father!" ",I seek only your happiness, my child; andI this officer-" "1 You know, sir, how noble he is I You have heard the officers who have been. here, and the consul, all of them speak of him in expressions of the highest praise." "True, my child. I know that if you should have him for a husband, you would wed happily. But I will hasten to see him; for, as well as yourself, I feel a deep interest in him!" Gertrude kissed her father; and )he was soon seen to leave the Casa Grande, followed, or rather guided, by Gaspar, his half-Indian Cuban ser- vant, and'go in the direction of the cigar factory' of Giberto. The surprise of the cobbler and of the cobbler's wife, of the perruquier and the per- ruquier's wife, of the wine-shop keeper, and of the neighbors generally, at seeing the mysterious re- cluse in the street, we will not stop the current of our narration to depict. They believed some great event had happened, was happening, and was about to happen and busied themselves all the forenoon in conjecturing what said event might turn out to be. But it was time for Don Garcia to appear in the streets' the letters he had received the eve- ning before rendering active exertions necessary now, if he would comply with the wishes of the "junta," which, and whose interests he repre- sented in New Orleans. Gaspar soon stopped before the door of the shop, and made known to Giberto, who was just. coming down stairs, the honor he was about to receive in: the visit of his master. Giberto, who had in his hand a rod which he used to open the leaves of tobacco with, hereupon brought it to the military salute, and said, that he was glad to see so eminent a customer visit his poor abode in person. "How is Captain Clifford ." asked Don Gar- cia, as he complied with the invitationr to enter. "He is doing well, senor. I will'letrhim know: you are here." t Askhim if he will see me." "Without doubt he will:l" and Giberto, quite elated at the visit, ran up stairs, and immediately returning, ushered the noble Castilian gentle- man up, with many;apologies for the humble character of his habitation;. "Don Garcia took the,' haud bf Cliffbrdl who' pressed it with gratitude, inmd lookinge around the room,.said: "I fear you will nothe .comfortable hete, and I have come to remove you to my hoise'-: .   "To your house, senor? repeated the captain, hardly believing his eyes, "Yes, if you think you are able to bear the removal." "O, yes, I could walk there, I verily believe!" "No, senor capitano, you are not able to stir a limb; you know that," answered Giberto, very positively. "He could only be taken On a litter. But the doctor refused to, let him be moved for a week, at-least, senor!" "That is true! I fear, sir, I shall have to lay here; but I am comfortable. Giberto is as at- tentive as a nurse could be; and I fear I shall be compelled to put off my removal to your hos- pitable- mansion till I am better; and then it will be too late; for there will be no necessity for trespassing on your hospitality." "You shall convalesce with us. If you can't go now, you shall go when you feel better. I have promised Gertrude to bring you!" "And does she know--" "She -knows of your illness, and sympathizes with you!" "Then," he said, as his pale face lighted up, "I can bear it.' I will bless the blow that awak- ens smnpathy for me in your daughter's breast-!" "She is right," saidT Don. Garcia; to -himself; "Gertrude is right. He loves her. There is no use in trying to stqp the current when ebb and flood flow both the same way." Alter passing an hour with Clifford, Don Gar- cia left him, saying that he would visit him daily till he was able to bear removal to his house. He then took his departure, and reported to Ger- trude the result of his visit. She thanked him for his goodness in promising to remove him as soon as he was better, and then said: "Dear father, I would try to put away from my heart:all thoughts of him, if I thought he was unworthy. But I have seen in him such a noble nature, that I only wonder he should regard me with any consideration. I feel honored, and re- spect myself more to think that I have awakened in such a man esteem and affection." "Youtdo'nit know how good and beautiful you are, Gertrude, dear I You would' grace, the crown of the best mobnarch that ever sat -upon a, throne.: But, if you and Captain Clifford wed, and are happy; my ambition will be satisfied. An American army officer ranks with a Spanish or British noble."  ' Thus speaking, Don Garcia left her to look after the important affairs which, since the let-,4 : tersiwee received the evening before, oecupiedl-: s mind.   CHAPTER XI. "ADY G(ERTRUDE AT VESPERS. CURIOSITY OF GUIDO.   THE weariness of that long day passed by Edward Clifford upon the artilleryman's cot was alleviated not:only by the recollection of Don iarcia's visit, b  by the recePion, two hours after his departure, of abouquet of sweetflowers. His soul inhaled the delicious fragrance of the gracious words wherein the Dona Gertrude ex- pressed her sympathy for his sufferings, and her hopes of his speedy restoration; and assured him that she had her father's promise that when he was able to be removed, he should become their invalid guest at Casa Granda. Although in the note she did not absolutely tell him how dear he was to her, yet every line breathed her pure and womanly devotion. "This is'a balm for wounds both of the heart and body, Giberto," he said, with happiness danc- ing in his eyes, as he read the letter,over the third time, while Giberto watched his face. "rI kCnew it would do you more good than all the .^criptions the  doctor wrote, and told Gaspar, the indian, so; and you see I was right. t I shouldn't be surprised next to see Dona Ger- trude herself coming here!" "Indeed I I fear such happiness is not in store,  for me i" "Well, who knows?   But you must not talk. Every ten words you speak will put you back an' V hour."  3*   "I can read the note and look at the bouquet, Giberto, and I am content to be silent." "Listen to me, now, senor. They pursued your assassins to the waterside, and saw them embark with three other men; but as the gen- d'armes had no boat, they could not pursue But they saw it cross the river." "I can't, imagine their object. I never saw either of the men before." "No doubt they attacked you for gold 1" "Did we not overhear them plotting? If't was against me they were conspiring when we heard them under your window, it was vengeance they were after." "True-so they seemed to talk. Ah, X have it, senor 1" "In what way? Who are they, thifnk you ."' "You never yet knew but one man t0ove a' fair maiden? Do you comprehend me, senor!"' "Not exactly."  "Do you not suppose that the fairDona o er- trudis has other admirers?" "Without doubt."  "You have, in all 'likelihood, an unknown rf. val, who has done you'this mischief." "You are no doubt in the right, Giberto."i "Gaspar told me when' he brought the' note, which you have just placed on your heart, that; being awakened by music list fiight, bhe lookd   through the little grated window, which he says is placed in the side of the gate, as is customary, and saw that after you went away, you were fol- lowed by two men, who kept as much in the shade as possible." "Then it was me they were waiting for at your door. I should have followed your advice, my discreet Giberto, and I should have escaped this wound." "It can't be helped now, senor capitano. The cause of the attack, I do not doubt, was rivalry." "I have no doubt of it. I am now curious to know who my rival can be. It is no one who can be worthy of Dona Gertrudis, who would take this method to get rid of me." "That it is not! I hope we shall find him out. Don Garcia will be able to tell who is ac- quainted with his daughter; and as I can de- scribe the taller, for the smaller was but a ser- vant, we may be able to fasten on the assassin, if, as I doubt not, he is a rival! But you must not talk. I hear some one in the shop. Adios, senor, for ten minutes." "I am not alone, now," said Clifford, with a smile, as he glanced at the bouquet? which he now discovered was arranged by the floral al- phabet, which he had learned in other lands. He read in the language of the flowers, these words: "Constancy, truth, forevermore!" "Noble, generous Gertrude I Thy frank and truthful heart knows no concealment of its pure passion. I am not worthy of thee! I have cause to bless this wound, which has, as it were, matured and ripenee to the full thy growing love for me, It was near the close of this day that Dona Gertrudis was standing in the window of the balcony, gazing thoughtfully on the rich light of the western skies, in which the sun was just set- ting in a sea of crimson and gold. The vesper bell was tolling, and its cound floated past her on the evening air as if calling her to,prayer. "I will go and pray for him," she said, " and to thank the virgin for the preservation of his life!" Don Garcia was in his library, engaged in conversation with two or three strangers. With- out speaking with Rim, she cast her mantilla about her, and descending the marble flight of stairs, crossed the paved court, which was fra- grant with the blossqms of the orange trees that shaded it, and cool with the falling water of the fountain. Near the gate .stood Gaspar, who opened it for her to pass out.   "If my father inquires, tell him I am going to vespers!" "Si, senorita," answered the Indian domestic, with a dignified inclination of his head; for in his manners there was at all times a gravity and native courtesy, seldom seen in servants of other races. Dona Gertrude entered the chapel, and was proceeding to the shrine of the virgin, when she saw standing before it a youth, whose beauty caused her to stop and gaze unconsciously for an instant upon him; but recollecting herself, she colored deeply, and drawing her veil about her face, she advanced, and was going past him to another shrine, when he moved away, as if to give her a place he iwas usurping. He seemed to be engaged in admiring the painting above the shrine, rather than worshipping. For a mo- ment or two the image of the extraordinary beauty she had beheld dwelt on her mind, and she could not think of her prayers; but it was only for a moment, for recalling the wounded Clifford, she began to raise her heart to Heaven - in devotional orisons, both of gratitude and peti- tion, in his behalf. So intently was she engaged, and so completely had she forgotten the young stranger, that her veil fell from her head uncon. sciously to her, and exposed a face of loveliness unmatched before in all the experience of the youthful Guido. He had been struck with the grace of her motion as she approached, and had caught- a glimpse of the splendor of her eyes, before she discovered him and veiled. 4e, therefore, watched her as she knelt, both with the worshipping eye of the artist, who adores the beautiful, and with lively curiosity. When NSer veil dropped, and .exposed the moulded head and neck, and the faultless profile, the tearful eyes elevated, the rich, red mouth, moving with the modulations of prayer, she seemed to him the personification of the Madonna, and could scarcely restrain the impulse to bend his knee, half in piety, half in gallantry, before so fair a creature, who seemed more to appertain to heaven than earth!  It was full a minute that he had to gaze in admiring wonder upon that pure and holy face, which prayer sanctified, before she ended her orisons; when discovering that her light veil had proved traitorous to its duty, she glanced quickly about her, and seeing the young stran- ger's worshipping gaze, she concealed her fea- tures, rose from the pavement, and hurried from the church.   "I must not let this fair vision vanish forever," said Guido, as she disappeared; and he at once traversed the space to the vestibule and gained, the street. At a distance he saw her passing the Casa Granda, and hurrying rapidly forward, but joined by a person who came from the gate, who kept a few paces behind her. This move- ment awakened his curiosity, and he went for- ward at the pace which she kept, and with diffi- culty kept her in sight, especially as it was grow- ing dark. After traversing two streets, he be- held her turn down one that led towards the river, the person who came out of the gate to join her going now a little before her, as if act- ing- as a guide. This increased his curiosity, and although he did not like to be in pursuit of a lady in this way, yet he experienced an un- conquerable inclination to discover who she was. Herbeauty, brief as. his glance had been of it, had made an impression on his heart that irre- sistibly drew him towards her. He, therefore, pursued, and to: his surprise, saw them stop and enter an obscure house, for from her appearance; he believed her high-born and opulent. His in; terest was now more vividly awakened, and he hastened till he reached the door, which he saw, from  a single lamp which lighted it, was the humble shop of a tobacconist. As he passed the door, he saw her seated, closely veiled, and Gi- berto and Gaspar standing, with the former of whom she was speaking.  But the passing step caused her to turn: her head, and the light falling l full upon the handsome features Of the young man she had left in the chapel, she started visi- bly; but whether with pleased emotion or dis- pleasure, Guido had no means of divining. He i walked on without stopping or drawing the at-  tention of the two men. "He will be almost cured by the sight of you, l senora," said Giberto, who' was all smiles; for m he felt justly proud of the honor of receiving so lovely a  guest.              C "I don't know that I  ought to have come; r but--"  "You have done perfectly right, senora I The good book says that we must visit the sick in a their affliction."  .            t "I remembered these words in my prayers, p senor Giberto, and therefore did I resolve to to come. So stopping  -at the gate to bid Gaspar b show me the way, I   thought I would see that o Captain Clifford was in need of nothing; for I n could not rest,in quiet to-night, if I supposed he d was enduring-any suffering that I  might have ttdie^1'                   h   "You are a, true Christian, senora," answered e Giberto, in a tone of positiveness as hearty as if d, he would have cheerfully challenged to mortal g combat any one who should presume to ques. 1, tion it. "I will tell him you have come to see , him-" - "No, no-not to see him!" interrupted Ger- trude, quickly, and deeply blushing, "but you, good Giberto, to see you, and learn how he was; and to tell you to take every care of him, and I will see that you are repaid for any loss that s your business may suffer thereby." D  "Thanks, senora, but I am paying a debt that I can never pay, by anything I do for el Senor r Capitan Clifford. He saved my life in Mexico, and can I do enough to show my gratitude ." "I see you are very kind and good, and that he could not be in better hands." "Thank you, noble lady. I can do but little; but it has leart in it. I can't smooth a pillow so softly as a lady, but I can smooth it kindly. You must not go away without seeing him, senora1"I "Not to-night. I will call with Donet ariea; perhaps," she answered; and then rising, she extended her hand as if to shake that Of thi ar- tillerynian, and left a heavy purse in it. "What is this i Tut I no, lady I Ido not'ned this I Don't pay me for doing my duty. I dfll not take it. Captain Clifford is' as' near to me as he is to anybody, and' no oi'e shall give me gold to take care of him." "Pardon me, Giberto, I did not mean to huit  your feelings." "I know it, senora, I know it. I am a poor man, but gold wont buy my good deeds or love for nmy neighbors I Here, -take it, senora!" Dona Gertrude received the purse, and putting her small hand in that of the honest soldier, said, with tearful emotion: "I see your heart is in the right place, good Giberto. If I had known you so well, I should not have offered you gold, nor felt anxious about the situation of Captain Clifford. Adios 1" "Adios, noble lady," answered the artillery- man, as he respectfully pressed his mustache to the back of the fair hand, " may all the saints protect you. Ah, I do not wonder now at Cap- tain Clifford's attachment to you. The note and bouquet you sent him almost healed him I At one time I  thought he would jump up a well man and dance a bolero. One such present a day, in a week he'll be up." Gertrude smiled, for this account deepened her happy conscious4ess of being loved.   "You may tell him I have called, Giberto, if you think it will gratify him." "Hi need not be told it, lady. He is in the room above, and as there is no door to the stairs, he has heard every word you have said; and I have no doubt is growing better every word that you speak." Dona Gertrude looked charmingly confused and smiling, yet half-annoyed she drew her veil about her face, and took leave without again opening her lips. Gaspar followed her. It was now quite dark, and he kept close at her side. After they had gone one square, seeing that some one'followed, he stopped, and speaking to a gend'arme who was standing on the corner, he reminded him of the attempted assassination of the preceding night, and desired him to prevent the further following of the person behind, lest he should be an-enemy; informing the gend'arme that the female he was escorting wes his mis- tress, Dona Gertrudis de Armas. "The person was standing near the house out of which we, came, as if in waiting," added Gas- par, "and I know that he was behind us when we entered it." "He shall be attended to," answered the guar- dian of the safety of the city; and Gaspar and his lovely charge passed on. "Dpst thou know, sir man-at-arms," said Guido,fpproaching the watchman, " the parties who stopped and spoke to thee ." The gend'arme would have responded roughly, but struck by his noble appearance and courtesy in his address; he replied:   "They have desired me to prevent you from following them, monsieur, which I have prom- ised to do." "Then I have annoyed the lady by my idle curiosity. It is no matter, senor, I merely de- sired to know the abode of the fair stranger." "She is of a noble Spanish family, which is all I can tell thee; thou hadst best promenade some other street, monsieur!" "Very well. I mean no harm, senor. I am a stranger in your city, and seeing the fair girl"'in the chapel, I did but occupy an idle hour in see- ing where so sweet a bird nestles! You keep strict watch on passengers!" "There is need! Last night, not far hence, an officer was well nigh assassinated by two strangers." "And were they taken?" "No. They succeeded in escaping in a boat to the other side, and probably have concealed themselves in the forests, or bayous." "This is my uncle and Tito," murmured Guido to himself, as he turned back and pursued his walk in the direction of his hotel. "By the golden rood I he has made himself a good name in this city, in brief. space. If I had no more conscience than this uncle of mine, I would hang myself I He would as lief cut a man's throat as Tito I and- Tito has no compunctions that way. Ah, here is the cigar shop, out of which came the lady I I can inquire here for what news I need, under the plea of making a purchase of cigars. This is a happy thought."   CHAPTER XII. GUIDO'S EFFORTS AT DISCOVEBRY.   As he spoke, he carelessly entered the little shop of the artilleryman, and seeing no one, he surveyed its mean aspect, and wondered what a noble Spanish lady could be doing there at such an hour with two men, both evidently beneath her in -condition. ".She is a mystery, as well as a beauty," he said. "But I hear a step descending." Giberto seeing a fine cavalier in his shop, bowed civilly, and when he asked in pure Cas- tilian for a pure Habanero cigar, he smiled with satisfaction, for he had confidence in men who knew a good cigar. It was, his maxim, that no rogue ever had a puro Habana del Isla between his lips. Tell me what brand of cigars a man smokes, and I will tell you his character on the spot. Giberto, therefore regarded the handsome and aristocratic-looking stranger with compla- cency, and handing him a box of the rare cigar he called for, he said: "From the island, senor?" "Yes, we have been there." "Castiliano, I have no doubt ." "I have seen Spain," responded Guido, who was pleased to have these questions put to him, as it would be an excuse for him to put a few inquiries also. "I would like to see it before I die, senor. A man is happy wl..m    g3 mlftd Of hl8 fore. fwher."    'I   "You are an Americano?" "A Mexican Americano, senor." "Your cigars are faultless." "I am glad they please you 1" "You should have customers of taste." "Yes, I do not complain." "Even ladies are tempted to buy of you!" "No, no, senor, not often." "I thought I saw one here this evening as I was passing." "Ah, true 1"Here Giberto's suspicions were roused, and he said to himself, "Be discreet, Giberto Blab not too freely. This stranger is acting the inquisitor. I will not betray la senora. Who knows what mischief might be made of her being here." "Who was the lady'-is she known to thee V" continued Guido, ignorant of what was passing in the old soldier's thoughts. "I don't ask the names of my customers, senor... Suppose after you left, one should step in and say, Senor Giberto, canst thou tell me the name of the young caballero who was but now in thy shop . I could only answer, I know not; it is not my business to ask the names of my customers, so that I know the value of the coin they pay me." Guido discovered in this-reply a caution which only increased his curiosity touching the name   and condition of the beautiful devotee of the chapel. But he would not press further inquiry in this question, but trust to his good fortune to discover who she might be. He was about leav- ing the shop, when Giberto asked, in the tone of a man who has news he would like to impart: "Have you heard of the attempt to assas- sinate Captain Clifford?" Guido could not prevent a deep color coming into his cheeks; for he well knew who had made the attempt, and dropping a cigar, he stooped to pick it up, in order to hide his emotion, which he feared the tobacconist would interpret into guilt. "Yes, I heard something of it, senor," he re- plied, recovering his erect attitude.- Giberto noticed the increased flush, but attributed it to the act of stooping. "I hope that he is not dead." "No, but it'was not the fault of the assassin. It happened right here by my door. Hran out to the aid of the captain, and just in time to turn a blow aimed at his heart into his. ribs. He is now up stairs on his cot; and will have to be on his back a score of days, I fear!" "Have you any certain idea who the assassin was?" There were two of them, senor. I think I would know them both if I should see them." "Ah, then there is some likelihood of his arrest."  "I hope so. I am a poor man, but I would give one hundred silver pesos to have either of them taken, especially the smallest one, who struck the blow, and looks for all the world like a vilano relation of mine, who, I have do doubt, has been let loose from hell to do this deed. His name is Tito," "What, the name of the assassin ." "Of my nephew." "By the good mass!" said Guido to himself, "this man is not wrong in'his surmises. Imust give Tito warning, or his. arrest will lead to that of Don Conrado., The rogue would inform to save his neck. I hope my uncle will soon get through with his business) and leave a city where we may all get into trouble." "I am glad to hear the officer is doing so well. Will you permit me   to go up and see him! Tell him I am an artist." "There can be no harm, senor. I  will ask him." Giberto soon returned,and beckoning to Guido, he went up after him,. Clifford surveyed the fine   features of the handsome Spanish youth with admiration, as he saw him approach his cot. Upon them was an expression of sympathy; for Guido by no means approved of all his uncle's deeds of violence, and especially of this, at the recital of which by Don Conrado in the cabinof the vessel, he had been justly indignant, .though he cared not to manifest it to him, whom he did not care to make his enemy. He was, therefore, now gratified at the opportunity of visiting the couch of the victim and sympathizing with one who, he felt, had been foully dealt with. The kind sympathy of his face at once won Clifford's confidence. "You are very kind, senor, to take the trouble to visit me," he said, extending his hand, which Guido pressed almost fraternally. "Sit down, senor; the 'apartment is humble, but a king's heart dwells here.," he added, as he glanced gratefully at Giberto. "To this brave man I owe my escape from death; and to his hospi- tality my present comfort." "Tut! not a -word, capitano, not any such talk about me! I have donemy duty. I hear some one in the shop. This noble gentleman I can leave with you with safety; for his heart is in the right place who knows how to feel and to show feeling for the sick 1" "You seem to have been severely wounded, sir captain," said Guido, regarding the resolute and chivalrous countenance of the cavalry officer with respectful interest. I am sorry for your accident." "You are very kind, senor." "I have no doubt you will soon be up again. Patience in such cases is a great restorer. Have you any idea who wounded you?" "None." Guido felt relieved. .He condemned the act of his uncle, but he did not desire his. detection, which would involve also, himself; and he had no desire to suffer for the crime of another. "Can you divine a motive, senor?" he asked "None, unless it hmay be rivalry," answered Clifford, slightly smiling; "this is Giberto's opinion. "But if I have a rival, -I , never saw him!" "A lady, then, in the case," said. Guido, plea- santly. "I dare say. But this was a cowardly way to attack a rival." ".will do the cavalier justice," answered Clifford. "Hemet me, fairly, and, now that I recollect, he did say that I had crossed his path in love, and that I must defend myself. I had forgotten this, Giberto is right.! :.It wau a rival   but who, I know notl He did not strike the blow, but it was the act of his companion, whom he would have kept back, in order to have the duel with me himself. I will do him justice so far; but he should have been satisfied that I was armnied with a sword, if he intended to give me a fair combat. As it was, I had but a pistol, which discharged, left me in their power. He was not a proper assassin; but he nevertheless took me at unfair advantage; and should have kept his man off. The cavalier was evidently a gentle- man, by his voice and bearing." "I am in hopes that your wound will prove less severe than is believed, senor." "Thanks, sir;" answered Clifford, who could not keep his eyes from the face of the handsome stranger, which he seemed to regard not only with admiration, but to study with a sort of re- flective perception, as if reminded by it of some reminiscence too shadowy and indistinct to be clearly fastened upon. "Giberto informed me that you were an artist, senor." "Yes, captain, I am rather an amateur than a professed artist; for my skill is not great enough to rank me with men of genius, who develop-art daily with their pencils. Yet I have painted portraits." "Senor artist, I have confidence in your skill. May I ask a favor of you?" "It shall be granted, it' in my power." "I  wish you to exercise your skill upon a face that would mock a common pencil. Yet, from your air and appearance, I fear me that you do t not need to resort to your pencil, and that I am I about to trespass on your courtesy." "Not in the least, senor. If I can serve you I  will do so." "  Have you an atelier in the city "  1" "  No. I am a stranger here, and have only a room at the hotel St. Louis. But I  have my g pencil and colors. You have only to command I me." "Then you can do me a great favor. But I must first obtain the lady's consent."   c "No doubt that will be easy, senor; as ladies r are seldom known to be indifferent to seeing t their features reproduced on the canvass. But ( I   only paint on ivory."        it "So much the better. I   wish a miniature. o Will you call and see me to-morrow evening?" asked C!fford, after a few moments' reflection. a "Yes, with pleasure."          to "Will you bring your pencils?"     h "I will come prepared to paint the lady's por- G trait, if you desire it."   e  "I am not certain that I can obtain her con- n sent; but you may cotme prepared, senor." e  The two young men then continued to con- o verse on various subjects, until they seemed to s have known each other for years; and when a Guido, after being with him two hours, took his h leave, Clifford saw him depart with real regret. t  "A proper and generous young man, senor e capitano," said Giberto, after he had shut up s his shop and come up stairs for the night. "Yes; he seems to possess every noble quality that could dwell in the human bosom. I should elove him like a brother did I often see him." "And he thee; for I see that thou hast taken I his heart, and that you will be great friends." "I wonder who he is?    He seems so much r above his position of earning subsistence by his - pencil, that I more than suspected that he was ; only an amateur, and consents to gratify me be- cause he dislikes to refuse me." His dress is extremely rich, and his appear- ance above any sort of occupation," said Giberto. l"Nevertheless, we must take his word for it. iNow to obtain Dona Gertrudis's consent" "That will be easy! I will go and ask it for you 1" "Thank you, Giberto. To-morrow   her ser- vant will be here; and I will try and scribble a note to her, and solicit the favor." "She will grant it, senor. No doubt of that at all; and so this handsome painter will soon give you her duplicate; and I have great hopes the sight of it all the time in your hands will help your recovery more than anything else--so I am for having Dona Gertrude consent. Let me but have her ear five minutes, and I would fill it with such arguments that she would even be willing to come here and sit for it." "I fear your zeal would overshoot the mark, good Giberto. To-morrow I will write to her. If she consents, I will send this youthful artist to the Casa Granda!" Captain, Clifford seeing Giberto put his finger on his lips as a sign that he was talking too much, ceased, and soon fell asleep, and dreamed that he was an artist and painting the picture of Gertrude, which when he had finished, presented, instead of her face, the almost equally beautiful one of the young artist. Before Guido went to his lodgings, he called at the cafe of Loupe de Blase. Here he was told, to his surprise, by Tito; that Don Conrado had gone out at dark, and was not yet returned. Guido then gave Tito to understand that he had   been recognized by the old tobacconist, and that it became him to keep as much within the walls of the cafe as he could conveniently. "What did the gray mustache say of me?" demanded Tito, who had gone up to the cigar shop after his master left, and from the opposite side watched the occupant till he was perfectly convinced that it was his relation in his own per- son. This discovery did not contribute to his satisfaction, and he returned to the cafe, where Guido joined him, quite disposed to abide by his advice to keep himself from observation. "If thou art taken, thou wilt betray Don Con- rado, and also lose thy own life." "I have no desire to lose it, be assured, senor Guido," he answered " if el senor capitan will give me leave, I'll go back to the brigantine and remain until he comes." "Thou canst ask him. Do you know whither he has gone 1" "To the house of Don Garcia de Armas 1"   "So I suspected. Tell him I have been here, and that I have learned that he can be recognized by the soldier, and. that he- must move with cir- cumspection." "The sooner we 'all leave this city the better. I can't stay in the same place with the artillery. sergeant, my relative!"  "Doubtless Don Conrado will complete his affair to-night; and if so, you may get away to- morrow!" "The saints grant it. Every time i hear a step I fancy it is old Giberto's." "Your conscience has made a coward of you, at last, Tito." "Thou knowest not all, senor," answered. Tito, with a shake of his head, as he let Guido out; and having shut the door, he added, "I must put Giberto Lopedo out of the way, or I am a dead man if he meets me 1" ;   CHAPTER XIII. DON CONRADO'S TIMELY INTERVENTION.   WE now return to the captain of the brigan- tine whose movements it is our purpose to fol- low. Upon quitting the cafe of Loupe de Blase, he took his way, under cover of the dark hour that intervened between the twilight and the ris- ing of the morn, in the direction of the Casa Granda. Wrapped to the eyes in his Italian cloak, in order that he might not be recognized by any of the gend'armes who had seen him the evening before, he threaded the streets at a rapid step; but being unfamiliar with the city, lhe lost his way more than once; but fortunately recol- lecting the name of the street on which Don Garcia lived, he was directed aright by the slaves whom he met; for he took care not to inquire of any other persons. As he drew near the man- sion, which he recognized by the height of its imposing front, he began to walk slower, delib- erating in his mind how he should approach the crisis which his destiny seemed about to bring about. Thoughtfully he passed along, when he heard a female shriek not far before him, accom- panied by voices of men, the clashing of wea- pons, and tramping of feet as of men engaged in mortal fray. He at once drew his cutlass, and hastened to the scene, drawn by the continued cry of the lady for help. As he drew near, he saw two men combating with one who was gal- lantly defending with a dagger a lady who was 4   - clinging to him, but whom a third ruffian was endeavoring to drag from his protection. In a , moment Don Conrado was at the spot, and rtaking the side of the single man, he made such good use of his sword that he soon laid one of the men at his feet, bleeding from a cloven skull, while the other fled i but the third still endeavored to obtain possession of the fe- male. Upon this, Don Conrado attacked him, but he found he had to do with a person well skilled in the use of the sword, and who fought with the courage and coolness of a cavalier. Victory, however, decided in favor of the cap. tain of the brigantine, he having maimed the sword hand of his antagonist so severely, that with an exclamation of anguish he let his sword ' fall, and took to flight. Dona Gertrude, in a voice trembling with strong emotion, both of gratitude And joy, cried, "thanks, a thousand thanks, brive sir I I owe you my life and liberty." ".I am too happy to have served you, senora," answered Don Conrado, who instantly recognize ' ed the voice of Dona  Gertrude, though three years had passed since he had heard it. He also trembled in his deepest soul with joy at the good fortune that had made him of such service to her, at a time when he needed the gales of his des- tiny to blow fair. But he did not see fit to make. r   himself known to her then, lest the cup which was presented to his lips might be dashed from it ere he could inhale its iragrance. It was too dark to recognize features, and only by voices could they have discovered one another. He, there- fore, replied'in a disguised and subdued manner, "I trust you are not hurt?" "No, senor. My servant, I fear, is wounded," she said, with feeling, for he was once stricken to his knee. Art thou not hurt, Gaspar?" "It is but a scratch, lady. A plaster will heal it in a day or two." "Thanks to thee, also, noble Gaspar! If you had not combated for me as bravely as you did, till this gentleman came up, I should have been carried off!" "I can never congratulate myself enough in being at hand, lady," answered Conrado. "Let us not delay here. Do you dwell far distant from this place?" "I live but half a square from here, senor!" "Allow me to escort you safely. The ruffians may return, and you should be sheltered. Have you any idea who they are?" "I have, senor," answered Dona Gertrudis, with a hesitating tone, which faltered as if she did not care to explain further. "Ah, ha! A second rival I have," muttered Conrado to himself!"I wish I had put my sword through his'heart. By the mass, my lady is attractive! But fortune has given me favor. What shall I do? Shall I attend her home, woo her in her house under vantage of rescuing her, for surely she will not look unkindly on her preserver; or shall I atteml t to carry her off to my boat now! If I had two of my men here now, I would make the attempt. But alone, and this Gaspar to fight for her, it will be im- possible. So I will banish ethis wild idea from my mind 1" - These meditations were interrupted by the voice of Dona -Gertrudis, who stopped at the gate of the Casa Grande. "Here, senor, is my residence. I am the daughter of IDqn Garcia de Armas, and as he will desire to ,hank you for the service you have done his Ahild, you must not refuse o" come in!" "Indeed, lady, I have done nothing to deserve your courtesy, or his thanksed but as it will give me pleasure to know better so charming a person as 1 know you must be, from the sound of your voice, for I cannot see your features, I will, ac- cept your invitation."   By means of a pass-key Gaspar opened the gate, and admitting both, closed it as half a dozen gend'armes, always too late at an affray, were hurrying past with iron heels, to the place whence the sounds of the combat reached their ears. On the stairs that ascended to the draw- ing-rooms, Gaspar met another servant, who told Dona Gertrudis that her father having been called for by two cavaliers in the uniform of officers, just at dark, had gone with them, saying that when Dona Gertrude came in from vespers, she should be told that he would be back before ten o'clock. At hearing this the heart of the captain of the brigantine bounded with joy. Gertrude expe- rienced for an instant a brief embarrassment at the idea of being left to entertain an entire stranger; but her grateful feelings towards him prevented her from wishing that she had not invited him. Gaspar led the way to the front drawing-room, upon the pier-table in which ad oftly-shaded solar light was burning like a silvery veiled moon, shedding a'mild and dreamy, radiance around, revealing arid half-concealing the gorgeous fur- nishing of the apartments. Dona Gertrude having led the way into this room, invited Don Conrado to be seated. She then excused herself for a few moments, till she could arrange her toilet, which in the rough handling of the affray had become disordered. Finding himself alone, he started up and walked the magnificent room. His eye, accus- tomed to luxury, was attracted by none of these baubles of wealth. He paced up and down with bent brow and thoughtful eyes, communing with his thoughts. "The saints deserve my orisons' he mused within himself. "By the fairest fortune that ever could h ;ppen to a lover, I am placed in the very boudoir-of my proud and beautiful mistress, her protector, and all her heart warm with grati- tude towards me!   What can I ask more!. Even Don Garcia is spirited out of the way, and the field is all mine to win, or-yes, there is the or-or to lose. If I were wholly a stranger, I have made a beginning that might make me one of her favored lovers in time, for I begin to per- ceive she has lovers many; for I have crossed with two already. But my position is worse than it would be were I a perfect stranger. She thinks well of me now, but when she returns, and I suffer her to see my face, which I have so studiously concealed since I passed through the   gate, she will begin to show me the cloven foot. I must keep incognito long enough to make a favorable impression upon her before she recog- nizes me. I must not hide my face. This wont do. I will lessen the radiance of this light some- what till there prevails a twilight in the room, which will serve to conceal my features while I try to soften her heart How incomparably lovely she has become. A little taller and fuller and with a slower step, but in all, enhanced in beauty like a youthful goddess in rich maturity. Ah, it were worth a voyage from the Mediter- ranean to the Mississippi, to gaze on such a peer- less creature!" While he was thus soliloquizing, he ap- proached the marble table on which the argand lamp stood.. A locket lay upon it. He tookit up, and saw the likeness of Gertrude, looking as he had last seen her, three years before. He stood and gazed upon it, holding it in the hollow of his palm. "How like her*!+ The same rich mouth, that so haughtily forbade me her presence! The same glorious brown eye, that sent forth light- nings to. annihilate me, because I did, in a mo- ment of too free love, alarm her virgin modesty! Pure and cold as the polar star!  O, lady, how can so much scorn find a home in a face so an- gelic!  Ah, what is this! a crucifix of gold I By the cross! it is one which in my first favored ( hours I placed upon her bosom.  She has pre- served it! She cannot, therefore, wholly hate the giver!" He heard a/light step, and instantly turning 1 the lamp  down, he said something as if he were s examining it and had turned it by accident, but a he placed himself so that it could not be ap-  proached to be raised, and so that his features 1 m ight be thrown into shade. It was Dona Ger. 1 trudis who entered.  There was light enough for a the radiance oft her beauty to be seen; and he gazed worshipping.              1 "I will raise the light, senor."      b "  No-do not take the trouble," he said. i "  I am sorry Don Garcia is not at home, sir; c but I trust he will not be long absent." "I should miss no other one, lady, in your presence," he answered, with gallantry.   i Dona Gertrudis slightly started, and bent her a glance earnestly towards the speaker. It was, I however, a   scrutiny that revealed nothing; for p his face was shadowy in the twilight he had a created.                   ti "May I   know, sir, whom I have the happiness s   t. of thanking for my protection4Wshe said, still, a as he saw, trying to make out his features as well - as their relative positions with the lamp behind t him, would let her. - "I am a stranger in the city, lady. It was by , accident that I happened to be near you." I  ( It was, indeed, senor. It was my own im- y prudence to suffer myself to be!exposed to such , an attack, by being abroad so late." a  "One of them seemed to be a gentleman." Dona Gertrude colored slightly, and bit her - pretty lip, but made at first no reply; but she - saw that a frown contracted for an instant one of his arched eye-brows. "Yes, sir, perhaps so 1" she at length said. I  Gaspar at that moment entering the room to t ask her if he should send in refreshments and ; coffee, she bade him raise the lamp. Don Con- 3 rado could show no reason for preventing his robedience to the command of his mistress, and as the servant approached, he rose and took his tseat so that the pedestal and statue of a marble Hebe would cast its shadow  directly in a line with his person. Gaspar raised the lamp to an exceeding brilliancy, and then left the room with instructions to bring in coffee intw quarter of an hour, if Don Garcia did not arrive. As Conrado rose and walked to the seat by the statue, the eyes of Gertrude followed him with curiosity, which was deepened from the certainty that he was studiously concealing his features. She therefore no sooner saw him take a seat on the fautueil in the shade of the statue, than she felt an uneasiness and a faintness at the heart she could not account for. She seemed to feel as if her courage was leaving her. A dreadful darkness seemed to settle upon her soul. She trembled, and he scarcely knew why. But she made a strong effort to throw off these feelings, and succeeded. "Are you a   native of Louisiana, lady?" care- lessly asked Don Conrado, who was not insensi- ble to a change in her, and who feared each mo- ment she would recognize him before the arrival of Don Garcia. "No, senor, of Spain." "Thou hast the noble Castilian air so/stri ingly, that I should have guessed this withot asking the question I I have been in Spain, and I am willing to take oath that its maidens sur- pass those of all other climes. There is a stately air, a proud step, a queenly grace about them as they speak and move, that stamps them with superiority!"   "You speak, senor, as if you had been favored with the smiles\of some one of these noble dames," said Qert ude, smiling. "Ah, no ladyy' answered Don Conrado, throwing into .voice a sadness that he truly felt, without doubt; " ah, no, lady; it has been my lot to love unrequited! To gain my heart and bend my knee where I was proudly dis- dained!" "The lady must have been cold, or else her heart given beforehand, to be wooed by a brave man and treat him thus!" "Neither cold nor betrothed, lady. Indeed, at first she looked. not unkindly upon me; she loved to hear my stories of adventure on land and flood, and she would weep or laugh, as the current of my tale ran sorrowful or gay. I fool- ishy thought that she whom I could move to tears I could move to love me!" "And would she not hear thy suit?" "Nay, lady; but when I spoke to her of love, of my deep passion, and told her how my hap- piness lay in her keeping, and that henceforth I should live or die, as she gave judgment, she spoke me proudly, disdained me as a wooer; and when I urged her to relent, she shut herself up from me! Her noble father was my friend, and he did use his parental influence to turn her heart to pity. 'But she was firm, and said that she had of late heard rumor speak my name coupled with wrong and rapine, and that she would not be a bandit's or sea-robber's bride." "But, sir, it could not be true," said Gertrude, her bosom heaving with some indescribable emotion. "True! It was the foul calumny of hundred- tongued rumor. But she believed it! and I, no longer slave enough to bow to the shrine that mocked my prayers, left her, and went to foreign lands. But I have not forgotten her! Every day she has been near my heart, and I have dreamed of her at night. At length I returned to seek her, and once more plead my suit." "And I trust she heard it with favor, if, as I cannot but believe, senor, you showed her that these rumors were false indeed.'- "I found her father had removed and gone to Cuba, where he held- rich lands. Thither I fol- lowed, and learned that he had been exiled for his patriotism, and come to New Orleans. Thither I came, also, and but yesterday arrived, in hopes that--"' Here Dona Gertrude, whose agitation had been sensibly increasing each moment, started   from her chair, and advanced two steps towards him. "I am not mistaken! Your voice! your story!--" "All prove me to be thy friend and constant lover, as well as recent protector, Conrado de Beltran," he answered, rising and standing in the full light of the lamp. "I recognize thee too well, Don Conrado,"' she answered, after a moment's terrified gaze upon him, as he stood before her,halfa suppliant, half-defiant. "I had not this foreboding of woe for nought." As she spoke, she shrunk back from him; for he looked as if he were about to approach her. "Do not come near me  Goll Leave me before I hate you again! Leave me while there is gratitude in my heart warm to- wards you for the service you have done for me this night! But, O, had I known to whose arm I was indebted, I would rather have chosen the fate from which you rescued me! For I foresee and feel evil and woe in your presence here!" "Nay, lady, nay, you are too unforgiving"!" "Unforgiving . I am not thy judge, evilman! I have nothing to forgive! I have nothing to do F with thee! Leave me! You say you have sought me out! that you have followed mefrom land to land! Ah, hbly Maria! more's the pity! Speak, and tell me why thou art here!" i "To kneel thus to thee, sweet and adorable Gertrude, and renew to thee the offer of my heart and hand! I am rich; Don Garcia is impoverished; I will enrich him, and thou shalt "roll in the wealth of a princess!" "Don Conrado de' Beltran, you must know that I detest you!" answered Gertrude, with a flashing eye. "I can never honor you or endure your presence. Your wealth is the spoils of blood! You degrade me and insult my noble father by such base propositions! I know your career! I know you to be as evil as the world has given you name for! I know you to bee disgraced by your queen; to be exiled from your paternal shores, to be a wanderer and an adventurer, nay, a buccaneer of the ocean, with your hand against every man!" "Prithee, how. much more hast thou learned, proud lady?"  "That you will never win Gertrude de Anmas. Therefore depart! If possible, I detest you more than ever, since you have this night placed me under obligation to you. I would rather have died than have incurred it 1" Lo            . T       :'   CHAPTER XIV. NEWLY EXCITED HOPE DASHED DOWN.   DON CONBADO had all the while preserved his composure, but evidently with a powerful effort. But now his eye lighted up like a leop- ard's, and with a frown darkening above it like a thunder cloud discharging lightnings, he said, witheringly: "Thou art a very pythoness, beautiful and fierce creature!I feel like striking thee through the heart, thou hast so enraged me; but I love thee too well, too well! By the mass, thy beauty is glorious ih the brightness of thy anger. Wo- man, I see you hate me 1 But do not insult me I There is a point of forbearance beyond which human nature will not yield!" "Then leave me!"  "If I am  so hateful to thee, why hast thou preserved this crucifix?" he demanded, as he snatched from the table the golden gift. "Thy touch, even, could not pollute this holy thing! In it I saw my Saviour in anguish, and not thy gift! I would not cast away such a thing as this! Its preservation has nought to do  with thy remembrance-but to its sacred subject!" 'I see you have no heart! I am an idiot to have loved thee, ever I will try and cure the madness.? "Thou wouldst be happier." "But thou hast a heart. It is not all Arctic ice. For thou hast lovers!" "Gaspar!" calledl Dona Gertrude, as she saw thia'Don Conrado'; eye glared furiously upon   her. The Cuban was at the moment approach- ing the door with coffee on a silver waiter. "Senora!" "Serve the gentleman, and when he has re- freshed himself show him to the gate," she said, in a commanding tone. Then turning to Don Conrado, she continued iR the same manner, "You will excuse me, Senor de Beltran, from further duties of hospitality. When my father returns, he will, no doubt, entertain you more agreeably than I have done." These final words were uttered with ineffable scorn; and the beau- tiful and incensed girl left the apartment, show- ing in her step, look, and air, that she felt herself deeply insulted by the intrusion of one sode. tested into the house, even under the peculiar circumstances of which he had availed himself to obtain admittance. "Ant incensed Minerva I an offended Juno I a pouting Hebe I a vexed Venus I an angry angel, all in one!" said the captain of the brigantine, as he followed her retiring figure with his eyes. He smiled  us he spoke, but there were evil thoughts in the smile. It seemed to express contemplated and sure revenge for all this. "It is her hour now! It will, by-and-by, be mine! Had she been less haughty, less personal, I might have forgiven her, and gone away and tried to forget her I But she has too deeply in- sulted me to be pardonedl Revenge shall be my   punishment. She shall be mine I will live only to get possession of her. The sun only   shall shine henceforth to give light to me to take her! the earth shall roll round only to cre- ate me time!" "Senor!" This was the third time Gaspar had tried to draw his attention to the cup of coffee that he was holding at his elbow. "Well, what is it?" "Coffee, senor." "Yes, coffee I need I Thanks. Are you the brave fellow who so well defended your mis- tress?" "Si, Senor." "There is a gold onza." "Thanks, senor." "Dost thou know the rogues who set upon you?" "One of them, senor, I think was a caballero." "He who had your mistress by the arm ." "Si, senor." "So I supposed. Dost know his name?" "I think a Count Lieutenant de Contelli!" "That is an Italian name." "Yes, your worship: he is a count who was in Cuba, and saw Dona Gertrude and would marry her; but she said no. Then he came here; and she said no many times, and now he has tried to run off with her!" "Aided by two men i I see now how it is! And is this the only admirer your mistress has '" asked Don Conrado, as he sipped a cup of the fragrant coffee, standing in the same place where Dona Gertrude had left him. "O no, senor," answered Gaspar, who was ignorant of the scene that had passed between his mistress and her preserver, and who felt dis- posed to be communicative towards a gentleman who had so bravely come to the rescue of his mistress. "She is never without noble gentlemen who would seek her hand in marriage. But she loves her father too well, senor, she always tells them, to leave him." "Ah, that is it, is it . Some of her lovers serenade her, I believe." "O, yes, all of thoem! We have fine music of nights. Alas, senor, last night a sad accident happened." "Nay, what was it? Not to any of Dona Ger- trude's lovers, I trust," he said, sarcastically. "O yes, senor. Ose of the gentlemen, Capi- tan Clifford, was followed after he left the bal- cony by two assassins-" "By whalt man ."   "By two assassins, senor," answered Gaspar, repeating the word that had so grated on Don Conrado's ears, with strange emphasis, but with- out suspecting the nearness of its application. The captain of the brigantine winced, but said no more, and Gaspar continued, " they attacked him near the shop of a friend of mine, one Gi- berto Lopedo, who sallied out to his aid, or he would have been slain; as it was he got a severe wound."-  "Then he was not killed?" "No, senor; but that Was no fault of the assassins. -Giberto took him into his house, and there he lies up stairs, and too ill to be removed, or he would be brought here." "Brought here? By Don Garcia's orders?" demanded Conrado, with angry surprise. "Si, senor. Don Garcia has great love for the noble young officer. And besides, it is Dona Gertrude's wish?" "Ah, it is?"  "Si, senor. She was deeply afflicted, as you must suppose, when she heard of the accident that happened to him aEld we were returning from a visit to him when we were set upon by this Italian, the fierce Count Contelli!" "Then Dona Gertrude has even paid the. wounded man a visit V"          I I "O, yes sir; and found that he was doing well, which was a great gratification to her." I "By the red cross 1" muttered Don Conrado, "my sword has purchased for him a favor in- deed! So she has visited him at this wretched cabin I goes through the city by night on these errands of love! This American, then, is my true rival!  This Cuban servantis. gossip is worth an onza each word." Resuming his ques- tions, he asked, " and Don Garcia, does he ap- prove of the intended nuptials between your mistress and this wounded officer?" "O, I can't tell that, senor! I don't know that they are to be married. They like each other!" "I have no doubt of it. Does she suspect who wounded her lover?" "O no, senor, there is no one to suspect, un- t less it were Signor Contelli, but it was too tall a man for him, sir." "You are an honest fellow, as well as brave, Gaspar. I have no doubt we shall understand each other," he added, to himself, as Gaspar bowed and left him, to go to the gate, where his quick ear detected his master's step. X     "So, Dona Gertrude has more lovers tha Of   one I But as she favors one, it matters not who it is, so she favors not Conrado de Beltran. He who is most honored by her love, is ,most hated by me. I hear the voice of Don Garcia. Al- ready Gaspar is busily relating to him the ad- venture of his fair daughter, and he hastens with exclamations of alarm and gratitude. I have no doubt he will be gratified when he recognizes who has protected her; for the father Ev;i fa- vored my suit." "Where did you say the brave man was?" Conrado heard Don Garcia hurriedly ask; "I must not delay to thank him. And Gertrude- where is she?" "She is in her own room, senor," answered Gaspar. "The cavalier is in the drawing-room." The next moment Don Garcia appeared at the entrance of the room. - He did not at first recognize his guest, but advanced towards him with both hands extended, saying: "Noble sir, receive a father's grateful thanks. My daughter was in danger and you protected her. I heard as I came along of an affray hav- ing taken place, and atman killed, but little did I dream he was slain by the defender of my own child." Don Garcia was about to embrace him, when he started with pleased surprise, and with an almost incredulous look, exclaimed: "Whoia do I behold? Is it indeed Don Con- rado de Beltran?" "No   one else, Senor de Armas," answered Conrado, embracing him. "And do I see you in New Orleans? This is a surprise," said Don Garcia; "but I am over- joyed to know that I owe my  daughter's safety to an old friend." And he embraced the cap- tain with warmth. "How long hast thou been here "                  .1 "But a day, senor. I was coming to thy  house, when I was so fortunate as to rescue Dona 1 Gertrude. But I fear she regrets it, senor." "It should make her love thee, Don Conrado. a How hast thou been in/the three years since we 1 met?  Sit down, and let us hear about the past." n "I fear that my remaining will displease thy daughter!"                g "Nay, I   will send for her. Has she not r thanked thee?" '             p "Yes, bai t:was before'she recognized me. 1 No sooner Id she discover that I was her old c admirer, then she told me plainly she would h rather have been murdered than be indebted to is me for her life. That is the terms on which w( 8 A; s . f    o stand. You will say not much improved from e what they were when we last parted." 1  "Not much, to be sure," answered Don Garcia, I- looking annoyed. "Not much. But I will see - her. She must not treat thee thus I But these i women are so whimsical, Don Conrado. Never- 3 theless she shall not behave after A  sort. If I s have to lock her up!"  "No--do not treat her harshy. If she does not love me, it will not make her love me to be strict with her. Let it pass. Perhaps, with your [ favor, in a day ot two she may look more kindly - upon me 1"       -  "I'll see that she -does. And you are really still enamored of Gertrude? Such love should ' be rewarded." "I have crossed the seas only to lay my heart at her feet! And it was my singular 'd-;or-. tune to be of service to her almost at^. door. But I will presume nothings. If she will love me for myself, well I t will try and forget her!" "No, by our lady of Cordova, not so, Don Conrado. You have my consent! ,You will get hers. Gaspar, bid Gertrude to come hither. Tell her I have returned!" Gaspar departed. "She bids me ask you to excuse her, as she is not well; but she will see you at her room," an- swered Gaspar, returning. "I hope, Don Conrado; you will excuse her to-night. To-morrow call, and I  will by then have talked with her. She has certain prejudices that I will remove." "Yes, she has doubtless heard tales invented by my foes. But you do not believe them, Don Garciae' "No. I hav,: too much confidence in a nobly. born gentleman like yourself, to believe you ever did what rumor coupled your name with. The best men have slanderers." "Thanks for your confidence, Don Garcia," answered Don Conrado, with an air of great ,humility, as if he had never committed a worse murder than the death of a house-fly. Don Garcia then ordered wine, and the two gentlemen drank together;. and Don Conrado remained two full hours, talking of the past, and playing his best card to secure the confidence of Don Garcia, and remove all shadows of suspi. cion from his mind. The result was, that when he parted from Senor de Armas, the latter prom- ised him the hand of his daughter, or else she should go into a nunnery. \   -CHAPTER XV. TITO'S NARROQW ESCAPE. A DEATH SCENE. 4   THREE: days have elapsed since the events related in the last chapter transpired. During this period, no one of our characters has been idle. Don Conrado, as we shall see, has been especially busy in furthering his own views. 'Twice each day after his first interview in the drawing-room with Dona Gertrude, had he pre- sented himself at the Casa Grande; but only in one instance could Gertrude be prevailed upon by her father to see him; and in this interview, which took place on the evening of the third day, she gave him particularly to understand, that she would rather consent to be immured in the convent with which her father threatened her, than to unite her destiny with his. Don Conrado, upon this, bade her a "good night," and saying that she should not be annoyed by his presence again, embraced Don Garcia, and left the house, taking the direction to his boat at -the quay. During the three days, also, Captain Clifford had been rapidly mending; for he received a bouquet-and a sweet billet every evening from Dona Gertrude, who always shortened her ves- per prayers at the chapel, in order to get there and back again before dark. So rapidly did he improve under this regimen, that his'surgeon pronounced it possible for him to be removed the next day.     '   There had also been a meeting, during the! three days, between Tito and Giberto. It was accidental. The old artilleryman had gone! down to the fish-market to purchase a fish, when his eye fell on the diminutive manikin figure of Conrado's servant. It was broad day, and hqre- cognized him at once. Without more ado he. advanced towards him at a military stride. Tito was the while wholly unconscious of his vicinity, being engaged in eating a banana, while he kept his eye on the brig's boat, which its guard had[ bribed him to watch while they left it and re- freshed themselves at an adjacent coffee-house. The first salutation of Giberto was a grasp upon the shoulder like a vice, that caused Tito to  utter a fierce curse, and to turn with flashing eyes, with his grasp on his dagger-hit. But- no sooner did he discover the stern gray eyes of his relative bent on him with the look of a lion, than he released his fingers from their clasp on the handle, became pale, or rather yellowish-white, and shook, fairly shook in his shoes, so ,great was his'terror. "So, then! I am not mistaken!  It is you, maldito! You do well to look frightened Do you remember me, vilano Tito i" : "I might as well forget el diabolos," answered Tito, "You hurt me, uncle!" "I will kill thee I hou hast well nigh slain   the best man in the land I Come with me, and et me give thee to the gend'armesl Thou ast twice escaped the gallows; and I believed thee hanged! But thou wilt not escape this time I The Mexican consul shall have thee put in chains, and sent back to answer for the great murders thou hast done!" "O,no, no! Don't be cruel, uncle! Thou hadst a good. heart once. If you send me back, they will burn me alive!" "No doubt of it! What art thou doing here? What crime more art thou ready to commit?" "O, none, none I I am an honest man as ever a padre on his knees, uncle. I am innocent of all wrong " "Didst thou not, three nights agone, stab a man?" "Yes, but that was three days ago. I mean I am innocent to-day, and was yesterday. I have done nobody any wrong this day I Let me go, I pray you, for you gripe like a horse's mouth.",r "Thou shalt go and be hanged  Ho, gen- d'armes! hola I Here is one of the rogues that did the deed of assassination Tuesday night! I'll vouch for him, for I saw him strike the blow!" Already a concourseof people had collected, and upon the cry for the city guard, two or three, who had been walking about the market, came up. Giberto heid him firmly until they extended their hands to lay hold upon him. But no sooner did he feel his uncle's hand relax, than he slipped down like an eel between them, darted like a hare between the legs of the tallest gend'arme, whom he pitched over so adroitly that he knocked his comrade flat upon his back; and Giberto was staggered by a blow from the man's arm, as he threw it out to break his fall. Away went the escapade like a fox, and after him in full cry, a hundred zealous people, who gave utterance,' as they ran, to the alarm cry, of " stop the assas- sin!"Tito, as we have said, was small and light, and as wiry as if made of steel. He was rnnning for his life, and he strained every nerve. A  gend'arme stood in his way to stop him, but he ran against him, with his dagger so fiercely  brandished, that he quickly gave him the path. But before him the crowd began to condense, as if to stop his flight, and seeing a small boat near, he turned aside, and leaping-into it, cut the rope that held it to the shore with his dirk; and pushed out into the river- Fortunately there was a  paddle in it, which he seized, and I plying it with skill and rapidity, he was in a few 4'   I seconds far from the shore, leaving a vast crowd l disappointed and amazed at his sudden escape. ISeveral of the more active leaped into boats, and prepared to pursue him. Seeing this, he tsent his skiff down the, river with the speed of an arrow, and was soon lost to the sight of those whom he had left, by the intervention of the numerous tiers of shipping. Three boats fol- lowed for a short distance, but the pursuers, see- ing that there would be no chance for them in the race, and there being no reward offered for the fugitive, they gave up the chase. Tito did not cease paddling until he had left the city a fnuk Fleague astern, when, finding that he was n followed, he ceased his exertions, and!let. the current drift him down to the place wriflthe brigantine lay .which he, reached al nig4.td      he n     o m. the ciltv;na   Don   on     p as hibest'collwhat had become of him. This JF*m Ater was not longin doing, for the boat- '*miet, the cafe had seen the race, and reporterd to their captain the mode of his escape. Don Conrado congratulated himself that Tito had not been secured by the gend'armes, well assured that he would not have hesitated to betray him to gain his own liberation. He, therefore, did not much regret his absence, hoping he had safely regained the brigantine. During these three days, also, the mystery enveloping the attack upon Dona Gertrude had been unfolded. .The officiating priest of the chapel, where the maiden went morning and evening, according to the custom of her country and faith, to worship, drew nigh to her as she was crossing her brow with the holy water from the font at the door, before quitting the church, and said in a low tone; "Senora! a few words with you I I have a message to your ear "  "From whom, holy padre," she asked, regard- ing his sorrowing air. with some apprehension. '"A penitent, whom I have left only two hours ago. He isnear death, and sent for me to con. fess him. He has informed me that he has done you a heavy wrong by attempting to carry you away, a few nights ago, by violence, and begs to see you before he dies, that he may acknowledge his fault, and obtain your, forgiveness." "Is it the Count Contelli, holy father, who you say is dying?" "Yes, senora. He will not survive through the night. He received a wound in the affair which-he did not feel at first, but which the last   two days has assumed a fatal character. I am about to visit him again. What answer shall 1 make to him?" "Tell him I forgive him, as I hope he will be forgiven by Heaven," she answered, fervently. "Will youi see him 1" "Nay, I do not wish to be present at such a death, father. It will do no good. Take him my forgiveness." The priest bowed, and Gertrude proceeded homeward, sad at heart at what she had heard, and feeling deep' pity for the dying couni, and alf-regretting that she had not gone with the priest.- But it was well that she did not let her feelings of sympathy overcome her discretion, as wy,see by- accompanying the simple, good r'i/ fi^Bea boe of the count. hI^   q k quarter of he tie ry remote Ofro   a Grande, and at extiemity of a street that terminated on the canal that led into the lake. The house was the farthest,;on.  4he obscure street, being built half-projecting over the very water, so that a boat could sail beneath the floor of the rear room. The out- ward appearance of the building was coarse, and wholly out of keeping with the domicil of a nobleman who sought to win the love of such a high-born dame as Dona Gertrude. The front was of stone, heavy with projecting cornices in the old French style, and the roof very steep, and covered with hollow red tiles. A faint light gleamed through the shutters as the priest ap- proached. He rapped at the door, and a voice from within demanded who was there. "A priest of the church," answered the father. A bar was heard being removed from within, and after a moment's delay, during which eager voices and hurried movements were overheard, he was 'admitted.  There was a large square apartment, rudely furnished, as if the 'place were but a temporary abode. In one corner, shaded by curtains, lay a. man upon a bed. He seemed about thirty years of age, with a finely chiselled profile. 'His hair, which was jet black, lay dis- hevelled upon his pillow, Which was of the finest linen.  His face was as white as wax, and his k eyes looked heavy, and  seemed to open with difficulty. The person who opened the door  was a female, once exceedingly beautiful, as her I rich, soft hair, fine eyes, and handsome mouth betrayed; but she was now a wreck, though her ' age was not abore twenty.  A sad, painful look seemed to be stamped upon her features, a look a of deep humility and consciousness of degrada. I ?n,   tion As the priest entered, she dropped-her head upon her bosom, and said reverently, and with the air of one who felt she was too great a sinner to raise her eyes to the holy man: "Thy blessing, holy father!" "It is thine, daughter," answered the good priest, laying his hand with a parental air upon her head. Instantly she fell upon her knees; tears gushed from her eyes, and her bosom heaved with deep emotion, as if to be spoken to so gently was more than her full and relenting heart could bear. He regarded her an instant with commiseration, and then said in a low voice: "Though thy sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as wool!" There was no reply. The female still kneeled, her face buried in her hands; and the grace of her unconscious attitude presented a study to a sculptor, for symmetry and elegance of outline. -The priest drew near the bed, and gazed at the person thereupon, who breathed heavily, as one dying. Twice was he spoken to before he turned his eyes and seemed to recognize who spoke. "Is it you, father?" he said, with a start. "What said the lady ." "That she forgave you, signor, and hoped God would also:" ' "Thank her-tell'her I shall die happy. [I know God will forgive-it is only difficult to obtain the forgiveness of our fellow-beings. Tell her-tell her-1 bless her with my dying prayer." Here he seemed to be almost overcome by an attack of pain that gave his countenance an ex- pression of indescribable anguish. The priest, who evidently believed him dying, held a crucifix to' his lips, and kneeling, prayed for, the peaceful departure of his soul. But he shortly revived, and pressed the hand of the father, and then glanced towards the kneeling girl. He tried to speak, but could not. The priest understood the elonuent appeal of his glance;, and rising, drew near the female, and  taking her by the hand, said gently: "He would say something to thee I He will soon die!" She rose quickly and hastened to the bedside. Sheknelthy him, and pressed his hand to her lips. 'tMagdelina," he said, with sudden energy, "Iife is over I All my-hopes are dead now! I must go to judgment. I would die at peace with thee I I have Wronged theel Thou h-ast loved me  through ali'my scorn and neglet l   When I sought to give to another the heart and hand that should have been thine, thou didst not complain beyond reproachful looks and silent tears! Thou didst say, that so thou couldst be suffered by me to be near me, another might be folded to my heart, so that thou mightest lay at my feet! Earth hath seen little such love as thine! Now that I approach the grave I see as I ought to see. I appreciate thy worth. I am ashamed of the wrongs I have heaped on thee I But if thou wilt now become my bride! If thou wilt give thy hand to mine from the grave, it is thine 1" "O happy bride,! O, joy, joy! Yet O, woe, woe, that I can only be a bride by becoming a widow!" "Wilt thou consent, Magdelina? Wilt thou take at last the only reparation I can make thee -take what belongs to death! Wilt thou bless and forgive 1" "Joy and woe! O, joy and woe!" she said, hiding her head in his bosom, which she cov- ered with the bright cloud of her glorious hair, that mingled with his raven locks upon the same   pillow. - "In this hour I forget and forgive all that is past," she exclaimed, with deep, thrilling pathos. "Holy father, unite us in holy matrimony." Hand in hand, lip to lip, heart to heart, as they were, the priest solemnly pronounced them man and wife. "One kiss, Magdelina l" said the count, in a scarcely audible voice. With that kiss departed his soul! Bride and widow in the same moment, the lovely and dis- honored, now full late honored, seeing that he was dead, uttered a shriek that would have moved a heait of stone. The priest attempted to soothe her, and succeeded, at length, in producing something like composure He at length asked her if the church should undertake, the burial. To this she consented, and promising to send two of the sisters of mercy to sit up with the dead, he took his leave, but not before she had knelt before him and imprinted a kiss of grati- tude upon his hand for the service he had performed.   CHAPTER XVI. A CHAPTER OF VARtED EVENTS.   HB had no sooner departed, than a boat was heard to row almost noiselessly up under the rear room, and a few moments afterwards two men entered the apartment from the rear room, which they had gained by steps leading from . the water to a trap-door in the room. *'  "How is this, signora?" said the foremost, abruptly. "We have waited at the mouth of the canal three days, and as many nights, in the barge, till we believed some accident must have happened, that the count did not bring the lady, and so we have come up to learn what has been done!" The speaker was a frank, bluff-looking young fellow, with the features of an American, and a face expressive of decided courage. He was dressed in a blue roundabout# with gilt anchor- buttons set upon its front and cuffs, a broad Panama hat, white duck trowsers, tucked into Spanish long boots. A belt was buckled round his waist, in which was a yataghan and a pistol. His comrade was a talli ungainly built man, with whity-brown hair, cut Quaker fashion, a round-brimmed felt hat, a long swallow-tailed brown coat, narrow-legged trowsers, woollen socks, and cow-hide shoes. He carried a' short rifle in his hand, and was chewing something with an incessant cud-like motion of his jaws. He had a small blue eye, that reminded one of a   gimlet, and a shrewd. aspect, that showed know- ingness and inquisitiveness. The countess, for such she had now a right to be called,.made no other reply to the words of the speaker than by pointing to the bed on which lay the corpse of her husband. He no sooner discovered that he was dead, than his face betrayed the strongest surprise. "Dead as a nail!" sententiously observed his tall companion, gazing upon the wax-like face. "How is this? Who has done this  Is it ,your act, at last, signora.?" "Mine? O, no. I loved him too well I It is God's decree. He was wounded in the attempt to bring off the lady, for whom he had a boat ready here to take her to yours. He has just expired; but not before he gave me the honor- able title of wife 1" "Wife " repeated the sailor-looking youth, with an expression of surprise and pain. "Yes, Signor Frederick, the priest who shrived him, by his request united us. It is but justice to his memory as well as myself, that I speak of this act at once."   ..    , "Married! Thou his wife!" he said, with passionate feeling, as the other went to call his men. "Thou Art also his widow, and I may not desr ,ir yet O, signora, this news has un. manned me I Count Contelli dead, and yet thou   not mine! Thou didst say once that thou wert not worthy of me, and now thou wilt say I am not worthy of the countess. Tell me that thou dost mock me! That thou art free to love' me!" "I know thy attachment to me, Frederick. I have esteemed thee, and do now; but if Iwould not wed thee while he lived, no wife to him though I was, I may not wed thee or any man now. The fragrance of the sweet honor he hath bequeathed to me shall be fresh about my heart till I die. These lips, that received his passing soul, shall never be pressed by another. Let this be thy answer once for all!" The young sailor's face expressed deep sor- row more than anger. He was about to make some remark, when the other came in, followed by two seamen, who approached the bed, and gazed on the body sometime in silence, with their caps in their hands. The death had evidently made a deep impression upon them all, but Benson's emotion was overwhelmed by a greater affliction, the certainty of the loss of one for whom he entertained a fruitless and romantic passion. "Wat is to be done with the body, lieftenant?" asked the tall man. "We will take it to the schooner, and give it a sailor's tomb, beneath the blue wave." "No, Frederick; the church will bury him to- morrow in the cemetery. The kind priest has taken the duty in hand 1" "Be it so, signora. Your wish is law to Fred Benson." "And you will stay to the burial?" "I would rather not, lady. I cannot leave the vessel longer, unless you command." "I will remain, then. Leave one of the boats, and I  will rejoin you in two or three days, so soon as I obtain and place-a suitable monument for his tomb. To-night two sisters of the church will remain with me."    ' , "You need us not, then. You will decide on the future after the funeral, and what is to Ibe done with the schooner."  Y"Yes. Now, I can think of nothing but tears." "Good night, signora. I will at,once return to my vessel, and await thy coming, to convey thee whither thou wilt go."      . "Thanks, Frederick. But do not, let thy thoughts- run upon any hopes that: my regard for thee may lead thee to cherish. My future years will be spent in a convent " '    The young sailor turiiedaway as if he would net trust himself to speaky and taking a lst look  4   t at the face of the dead, he left the room. The i next moment he was heard leaping into his boat. u   "Deth is a mightyr solemn thing, marm," ob- ' served the tall man, as he stood leaning on the [ muzzle of his rifle, while he anxiously fixed his I gaze on the cadaverous features of the count; i "especially when a human is struck down in ifull life without bein' wasted by no sickness. All flesh is grass, and withereth away!" I  "He was a noble man, signor Job." "Ah, yis, he was a right respectable pusson, if he had only been raised with different notions 'bout matrimony and sich like (don't mean to make no reflexions, marm, especially since he's made all strait in the end), but can't 'xpect a 'Talian count to be civilized like a free and in- dependent American citizen. I'm sorry for yer, rmarm, and hope it'll be sanctified. Dust we are, rand unto dust we must all return I So, marm, you mean to go to a conventicle." "A convent is my only home; now." "I dare say it's a nice plian for a woman. Wall, about the schooner; I.:Fi' you're cap- tain now, since your husband wawner." "After I rejoin the vessel, I willf decide what is to be done. The only further service I want of her, is to convey me to Vera Cruz." At this moment the "' sisters " came in without knocking. Job Sorril stared at their black hoods and queer black capes, and then making a bow, said: "Your servant, ladies. I'm glad you're come, coz marm here'd feel lonesome. It's the lone- somest thing in the world to be in a room with a dead corpse. It .is lonesomer than is if there want nobody at all I You are right neighborly to drop in so. It's what is commanded, to visit the widders in their affliction, and keep them- selves unspotted from the world. I wish you a good night, ladies. We'll'wait for you on board, shall we, countess!" "Yes,- Senor Job. Within three days I will be on board." -The tall individual then departed, followed by the two sailors, who both shook hands in si- lence with the young 'widow before going away, as if out of respect to her grief. In a few min; utes the boat was heard to pull away; and as it was passing down" the canal it was met by another, which, from the words interchanged, proved to be the count's own boat, the one he had come to the city in, and kept for the purpose of conveying away his expected prize, Dona i ertrudet. The perions in Ulirstd they had been ,            f-/   across the canal after a witch, or sorceress, who had great reputation in healing wounds, hoping she could restore the wounded count but they had not found her at her hut. When the boat's crew were now told of the count's death, they manifested the deepest grief, showing that the noble born Italian, though he had so clandes- tinely attempted the abduction of the maiden whom he loved, was not, without redeeming qualities. That he possessed them was also sin- gularly exemplified in the profound and un- flinching affection for him which held place in the bosom of the beautiful Magdelina, against all dishonor, all neglect, all rivalry, all jealousy. We have now shown that the three days which have elapsed since Don Conrado rescued Dona Gertrude, and left her on the third evening, as he said, for the last time, have been fruitful of events. We have one more circumstance to al- lude to, and then we shall return and follow Don Conrado's movements after he quitted, as we have seen, the Casa Grande. The circum- stance we allude to is connected with the inter- est Don Garcia took in the invasion of Cuba. During the three days that elapsed after the night on which he received his parcel of letters, he had many interviews, both at home, and in other secret places in the city, with persons whom he hoped to bring over to his party but having on the third day received a package from Havana, containing a proclamation of pardon to himself, and the restoration of his estate, with a friendly letter from the captain-general, his old opinions of the excellency of the royal govern- ment returned; and without the counsel of Dona Gertrude, he resolved to accept the restoration, and become loyal to the government and con- stitution. To this resolution he was the more strongly inclined, since he had discovered that three of the chief American' generals; whom he hoped to have engaged in the invasion, declined to have anything to do with it, especially as the government had branded as pirates whosoever. should be concerned  in it. This, defection, therefore, made Don Garcia less reluctant to abandon the enterprise; and he therefore the same day wrote to the captain-general that he thanked him for his favor, and would speedily return to Ciuba, delaying only to arrange his- affairs. He also wrote to the junta, declining to have farther to do in the conspiracy, and returned the official papers which had been received from their hands. This retrograde measure was all taken on the aeroon of At third dayj ad bew   ) fore night the letters were placed in the post for Havana. This step he kept from his daughter, well aware that she was a patriot from principle, 3 and not from money, as he had been; for he forwarded the revolution in his exile only to 3 retaliate against the authority which had,wronged him. We- will now follow Don Conrado on his way to the quay, on that evening of the third day, when he left the Casa Grande in such an angry mood, secretly breathing vengeance against " the proud and insensible girl," as he termed the lovely Gertrude. Upon reaching the quay it  was quite dark. The moon had not risen; but he was guided to his boat by a small lantern, which he directed should be kept burning for this purpose. On coming to the waterside, he saw his men in their places; for he had given the strictest orders that they should on no ac. count leave the boat that night, but wait for him with the expectation of seeing him each moment. "Rodrigo!" he called, in a low voice. "Senor, is it you?" answered Roqrigo, and he replaced the cutlass in the scabbard, which on seeing the dark form of the captain approach, he had prepared to use.   t "Yes. You are all here T-r "Si, senor, and ready to: obey. Is it time?" "Yes. Where is Carl os.'? "Here, senor," answered the lad we have al. luded to as holding a sort of middy's place in the brig. "I am holding the lantern!" "My men, I want you now to go with me on a perilous service." "We are ready, sir;." "Not so loud! Remember we cannot be too quiet. There is a lady in the citye whom I intend to carry off to-night." "Si, senor," answered the men, readily. "u Two of you will remain here, and obey Rod- rigo, who will,be on the watch. Carlos, you and two men will accompany me well armed. Rodrigo, you will hold the boat to the bank by hand. Have no fastenings. Be ready to receive me-and my party at a moment's warning, and push of the moment,I touch the thwarts; for it is possible I may come flying from pursuit." "Si, senor." "You will have your arms in your hands to aid me on the bank if I should require your ser- vices Carlos, you will now  come with me. You two men follow at a distance, one of yon on one side, and the other on the other side of i hthoe stee We, mu. niFot tl I gire *e sinal,   be suspected of belonging to the same party. It is now eight o'clock; by nine or ten at the farthest, if I succeed, I shal be here. If I am not successful, it is because I am a dead man." In a few minutes Conrado was moving up the nighest street; and after ten minutes' walk he came to a fiacre, that stood at the corner of an orange garden, in the obscurity of the shade of the overhanging trees. "Is it thou, Pierre?" iasked Don Conrado, in French. "Oui, monsieur," answered the driver, a small PFrnnchman, in a glazed cap and blue capote, holding in his hand an extravagantly long whip "Follow me at fifty yards, slowly, as I in. structed thee when I engaged thee." "Oui, monsieur," answered the man, gathering up his reins; -and muttered to himself, "I would follow thee to the pit of le diable for the gold thou so freely payest. There is some mischief going on; but parbleu, what are fiacres for but to help out mischief! Let me see!  In my day I have run off seven couples! I have escaped five rogues (two of them paid me not a sous)! I have carried two runaway wives, and then two husbands after them I I have received two kegs of gold taken from a. bankl I have taken two dead bodies to the doctors'college! Bless me! what would this world do without fiacres; and   accommodating fiacres that never ask questions. I have known a score of fiacres ruined by too much inquisitiveness. As for me, I take it for granted that I would be asked only to do honest jobs; and if they turn 'out the contrary, that is not Pierre's fault." Don Conrado soon reached the street on which lived the old artilleryman. He was now more cautious in his movements. He stopped on the corner, and in the darkness surveyed the house of Giberto as well as he could. A light burned in the upper window over the door, which he well knew came from the apartment of Captain Clifford. "Carlos," he said, " now the time approaches for us to act. Take this note. It is in Giberto's handwriting, for I imitated his hand from a bill for cigars I saw from him lying on the table at the Casa Grande. The note I wrote there to- night, before I left. Itis to Dona Gertrude. It represents Captain Clifford as- dying. Say that she must not delay. There is no doubt that she will come with you. The note says the fiacre and you are sent by Gibertol So you know your cue. I  shall expect you to succeed! I shall meet you on the way." "I will do :my best, senor," answered Carlos, as he sprung into the fiacre, the driver of which already knew where he was expected to drive.   CHAPTER XVII. A VILLANOUS PLAN OF ABDUCTION.   WHEN Don Conrado had seen the fiacre drive off with Carlos, he took the same direction, slowly followed by his two men, who were both armed, and had been selected by him for their courage and implicit obedience to his slightest wish. They passed in their walk -two or three gend'armes, who supposing them to be quiet citi- zens, paid no attention to them. The street on which the Casa Grande was situated, was one square and a half in the rear of the place where Giberto's shop was located, and then three squares further in a southerly direction. Don Conrado upon reaching the corner which brought him to this street, listened for a moment atten- tively. "The fiacre has stopped. I hear it no longer," he said to one of the men, who came up to him. "a Now, he added, give particular heed to my in- structions. * The least deviation from them may defeat the dearest object I have ever had at heart. You know that it is my intention to convey a lady on board the brigantine. Who she is it matters not to you. All you have to do is to second me. The fiacre is by this time at the house where she dwells. In a few minutes, at least within a quar- ter of an hour, if I, know the lady's character well, she will pass here in it with Carlos. The signal that he will give us that she is inside the carriage will be lto open and shut the window as   he passes us. He has my orders, as well as the driver,/to drive straight to the boat. If she no- ticesS, he will pretend to be lost, and so reach the river side. If, however, she suspects any- thing, as she may, for she has of late been alarmed by an attack, and attempts to leave the carriage or give alarm, then we are to make our appearance. I shall get in, and one of you mount behind, and the other get on with the man, and we can thus manage to protect her from rescue, if not by whipping up the horses, by fighting, if we' are stopped. It is a daring deed to manage in the heart of the city, but I am going through with it." "And you may depend upon us, captain," answered the two men.          i "You are to understand, that you are to fol- low the carriage to aid if any attack should be made, but not make yourselves conspicuous oth- erwise. Walk on now slowly in that direction, for I perceive that two of the city guard are ap- paxently. observing us from the opposite side of the way." The two men indolently lounged up the street, one of them smoking a cigar, while Conrado walked in the direction of the Casa Grande, ima patient to learn the result of the errand upon which he had sent Carlos. We will precede the youthful, but vice-hard-   ened, messenger of the captain of the brigantine, to the abode of Dona Gertrude. We have al- ready said that Conrado left the house early in the evening, and with the assurance to her that it would be the last time she should behold him there! His departure in this angry mood did not alarm her. She did not, however, treat his emotion with contempt, or smile with triumph Sle was too generous for this; too benevolent and noble. She regretted his wrath, but feeling she could not prevent it, she tried not to give him a second thought. She had been so pained by his renewal of addresses to her, that she could treat only with the firmest resolution of refusal to listen to them. "Gertrude," said her father, who had been some time silent and thoughtful, after the de- parture of Don Conrado " you have displeased me in this rejection of a man who has twice sought your hand; whose ardor not three years has .cooled; and who has crossed the ocean to ask a second time the love which he hoped time might have-oh*aged in his behalf." "I amtgHieved, dearest father, that -I have displeased you," she said, tenderly. "But I can never consent to be the wife of Conrado de Beltran." "There is no fear now, for he has tsifct in the bitterness of his wounded pride he will never cross this threshold more!" "I hope he will not perjure himself," she said, with slight irony. "How can you, reject such a'match? He is noble--a Hidalgo!  His ancestorswere compan- ions for kings." "Were Conrado de Beltran king of Spain, and should offer to crown me queen of Spain, 1 would not wed him  ! I could not sit upon the sanme throne with a man I so detest and-and -" "And what?" "Andfear'"         .? '  "Fear!  One would suppose from your words, X Gertrude, he were a very Blue Beard!"   a " Blue Beard was a generous fellow compared c with him, for he did not punish his wives save I for disobedience to his commands; it was half t their own fault. But Conrado dq Beltran would h kill for the whim. Do not frown, dear father! h I  know you think well of him!"     n "' He has satisfactorily explained to me his in.-  nocence of all the deeds withl which rumor cc charged him. He says he is now in high comrn h mand in the  Spanish navy; and being come 5        t -   i, over to Cuba on a mission of vital importance, - hearing that we were here, he could not resist n the impulse to fly hither to cast himself at vour t feet. The very name of his vessel, he says, is a "La Gert1'uis," for thyself!" "Thy good heart, dear father, makes thee t credulous. But I have certain knowledge that 9 he is a bad man! that he has been expelled from the service of the queen; that he is now an ad- t venturer, and that if he is not at present, he has been a buccaneer!" "Thou art beside thyself, girl 1" answered her Ifather, rising and looking greatly displeased. I "This is not true I If I could believe it, do you suppose I would wish to sacrifice you to him. Who has told you these things?" "I will tell you one from whom I had them. You have frequently sent to the cafe of Senor de Blase to furnish dinner for extra guests. Yes- terday he called here to receive your orders for the dinner you gave Don Conrado and the two Cuban gentlemen. After he came in, Don Con- rado entered and passed up to the drawing-room He saw him, and turning to Gaspar, asked if he knew who he was. Gaspar foolishy replied that he was a cavalier to whom his master's daughter was betrothed. Tell her, then, said he, I wish to see her 1 All this I overheard from my room. Gaspar brought the message, and de Blase drew near to the door and said he had a desire to say a word to me in particular. Supposing it was about the viands, I told him to speak where he was; for you know he has a bad countenance, and one would not 'wish to be alonS with him. He then looked carefully around, and said in a low, earnest tone: "' Senora, out of regard for thy happiness, I warn you against that man above stairs. It is Don Conrado de- Beltran, and he is a buccaneer. 1 have known him well. I can give you proofs if you desire-it. His piratical vessel is below ,he city somewhere. If you would be happy, rather fly from your father's roof than stay a moment beneath it while it shelters him. In order that you may know that I know him, let Don Garcia send, and he will find that he is a -ruest at my house. I was once a bucaaneer with him; but I have repented the past; and because he recognized me he stays with me. He has not made me a party to his object in visiting the city; but be sure that no good will come of it to any one who eats salt or crosses hands with him 1' "With these words, father, he bowed: and alelft   me I! But I was by no means overwhelmed. I had heard much like this before. It did not take me by surprise. Fortunately as I was not in love, it did not break my heart." "This is a strange history! But de Blase, having been a pirate, cannot be believed." "Having been a pirate he should know. Is it not surprising that de Beltran should remain at his house?" "Yes, I confess-but-but he says he has been, a celebrated, or is -now a celebrated pirate! We never heard a buccaneer of the name of Don Conrado!" "True, and I forgot to tell you that de Blase informed me that the famous buccaneer, Captain BELT, whom everybody has heard of for his Gulf exploits, is none other than Senor Capitan de Beltran." Don Garcia upon hearing this started with a loud exclamation of amazement "Can it-can it be possible I Daughter, daughter, if this were true, what a fate I was preparing for you! If it be not true, what a foul wrong has been in- flicted upon Don Conrado. I wish I knew the truth." At this moment Gaspar appeared, and an- nounced the father confessor. 'Upon hearing this the face of Dona Gertrude became as pale as a lily; for it brought before her mind the dying Italian, whose sad fate she had momenta- rily forgotten in the more immediate subject of whichi we have just been treating; : Listening-to the glowing dictate of pity that possessed bhr soul, Gertrude rose and advanced towards the priest as he entered, and rather with the eloquent, inquiry of her eyes than her lips, she sought to know the fate of the penitent, whose condition so affected her. He is at rest, senora i" "Dead?" "Not, however, till he had received into his soul the peace of your forgiveness!" "Christ have mercy  upon him!" she ex claimed, looking upward for a moment in prayer. "Who is dead?" asked Don Garcia, with surprise. "1 The Signori Count Contelli, senor!" "The young Italian who has been twice here: How happened it?  It is sudden." The priest looked at Gertrude, who gave a   sign for him not to reveal the circumstances of his death; and then answered: "He was hurt by a sword wound, senor." "Ah. A hot-headed young man! Doubtless a duello! How many men's lives are cut off before they get a gray hair, by being too quick to resent a wrong, which if they would wait a while they would forget they had ever received and perhaps, when reminded of it, find it difficult to recall from whom! Time, only let it roll quietly on, cures all these things. He was a well-born noble. of Milano, they say. What he did here, I' know not. I met him at Havana, and I have seen him often in Spain. It strikes me he was something of ,a wanderer, yet with much wealth to squander. Dost thou know, Gertrude, I have half guessed he sought thy hand; but then I was never sure, as he did not seem to be in love when he saw thee! Good father, wilt thou sit down and take a glass of wine? Thou art fatigued, I know. You good men are always tramping on- errands of mercy trci dawn to dark, ay, and all night, too!" 'he priest sat down. He was a thin, dark- taced man, with a Roman physiognomy; his black hair cut close to his head ; no whiskers ; a black stock,and no collar; a long surtout,reaching to his a kles, and buttoned to his throat; black cloth gaiters, and a broad-brimmed black felt hat. His eyes were deep set beneath a pair of thick, hair, brows. His face was intelligent, thoughtful, mild and sagacious, with a pervading tone of calm and unbending courage. His age was forty-two or three. His rank in the church eminent tor talents and piety. Such was Father Clement, the confessor.         ; He had not long been seated,conversing with Don Garcia, while Gertrude remained pensive, thinking upon the sudden death of one whom, though she did never love him, she never hated, as she did Conrado de Beltran. Her attention was all at once drawn to the sudden stopping of carriage wheels at the gate. Their cessation was followed by a quick, loud rap at the gate. Don Garcia said: "That may be for thee, holy father, for it seems like a message from one in extremities, they knock so -alarmingly. Hasten, Gaspar, and open and see who it is!"    CHAPTER XV"I. GEBTRUDE IN DON CONRADO'8 POWER.   THE Cuban went down, and in a moment re- turned with a note. He was closely followed by Carlos, who had left his weapons in the fiacre, and being dressed in plain clothes, gave occasion to no suspicion or curiosity.  "What and who is it?" demanded Don Gar- cia.. "A note, senor, for Dona Gertrude. Here is the messenger." She received it from him with trembling fin- gers, for she had a presentiment that it was ill tidings. "It is from old Giberto, lady," said Carlos, who came boldly into the room, but looked abashed on seeing a priest. "He says you must come without an instant's delay, if you would find him alive!" "Who . Who alive, lad ." demanded Don Garcia. "Captain Clifton, sir!" "Does he mean Clifford, Gertrude?  Why, what is the matter . You are ill!" "No, father I this note tells me that Edward is likely to die-that his symptoms have changed for the worse I I must go and see him." "No. It will not do!" "He has desired to see me, father. I cannot be withheld from complying with his dying wish f' ,  , .   "The fiacre is at the door," said Carlos. "Old Hubert, I mean Giberto, sent it that you might not be delayed, or fear to come in the night." "I will attend you, senorito," she answered. "And you, holy father, you will accompany me I The bed of the dying is thy familiar place. He would have absolution from thee. Wilt thou go with me?" "tes, daughter." "Thanks, father!" "Curses, father!" repeated Carlos, under his tongue. "The old cropped head will spoil all if he goes. There is only room for the lady, I think!" he added. I "I will ride with the coachman," said Father Clement. "A fiacre should carry three," said Don Gar- cia. "I will not go, then, if there is want of room," said Don Garcia; " besides, I have some writing to finish to-night. You will see her safely there and back, and not leave her, Father Clement, a moment." "Yes, senor, I will protect her." "Then I will consent to her going. But it was very foolish for him to send for her I They are not betrothed. But a dying man's wish is law to the living." "Good night, dear father 1" said Dona Getr ,trudej who had thrown her mantilla and veil   about her, and was ready'to follow Carlos. "I will not be gone very long." "Adios, mia cara hija, I will wait for thee; and I trust that you will bring back word that this wounded officer is out of danger, rather than dying." "I have no hope, sir. I feel a strange, cold fear creeping about my heart! It presages evil I He will die, sir! Adios, padre mio, adios!" ("Why, child, one would think you were tak. ing leave of me to depart to Spain, you cling and weep so I If thou hast so mnuch- heart in this young officer's fate, I pray the saints he may live for thy sake." "Heaven bless you, dear father, for the prayer," she answered; and placing her hand on the arm of Father Clement, she suffered him to conduct her down to the court. Carlos preceded them, trying to invent some way to get rid of the priest But his wits were completely foiled. He had caught the eye of the confessor, and with that quick and accurate perception of character which boys always possess, he saw that he was not a man to be trifled with, or put off with a subter- fuge, unless of the deepest nature; and he had no time to set to work concocting a plot to get him to remain at home. So when he reached the fiacre, he had to suffer the padre to get in, for the priest had entered after Gertrude, on see- ing that it was empty. To his surprise he found that he sat down upon a cutlass; but he made no remark, presuming it belonged to the owner, or that he was taking it home for bome person. Carlos instead of getting in, closed the door, and bidding Pierre drive on, sprang up behind. He kept a sharp look upon the sidewalk, till he dis- covered in the obscurity of an angle the form of Don Conrado on the watch. As the fiacre passed he leaped lightly down and ran to him. "The dove is safely caged, but there is a crow in with her, and the devil can't get rid of him." "Do you mean to say she is in the carriage i" demanded Don Conrado, with intense earnest- ness. "Speak plainly." "Yes, senor; she is there, and a priest with t her!"                   c "A priest-a hundred devils I How happened  that, boy?" "He was at the house when I got there, and offered his services and  she wanted him to a shrive the dying man!"   t' "Then my   plan has taken, so far as she is r concerned. The priest we must get-rid of. Let d us walk famter or we lose the cmniage "I  P 11    Don Conrado now hurried on at long strides after the fiacre, breathing curses against all father confessors, and studying how he should manage to get rid of him. [ "We can give him bold steel, senor, if he is troublesome," said Carlos, in his ear, evidently divining the thoughts of his master. "Yes, that we can do! but it must be resorted to only in the last extremity. Hasten, boy! The carriage has passed the street leading to the cigar-maker's. As soon as she discovers this, will begin our trouble!" The two hastened onward. As they crossed the street he had just alluded to, he saw the light burning in the window of Clifford's room. He smiled demoniacally in his heart at the contem-l plation of the triumph he was about to achieves over his rival. "Farewell, and fair dreams, sir captain," he  said, sarcastically. "Thou wilt miss thy nursei to-morrow, methinks!" In the meanwhile the fiacre drove on. Ger- trude passed the time in listening to the account which Father Clement was giving her of the last moments of Signori Contelli, and was so deeply interested in his touching narration of the cir- cumstances of the bridal of death, that she was not aware when the carriage passed the street it should have turned down in order to go to the shop of the cigar-maker. Father Clement, not \ knowing where, he dwelt, did not of course ob- serve the fact. The fiacre, therefore, had gone two streets farther, and was just turning round the lower corner of the plaza, whvn her eye caught sight of the open square and the cathe- d al towers. She instantly exclaimed: "We are going wrong, father Speak to the cocher. It is on   street." "Then we are three streets out of the way I Cocher! son!" called out the confessor. "You are wrong.   Turn and drive to -- street. ' Where is the lad?" "Parbleu! I think that I am out of the way, holy father!" answered Pierre; "but I  can't turn here without breaking the pole; so I will drive round the square and back that way. I can do it in a minute, my horses are so fast! The lad is up behind." With these words he whipped up his horses, and pressed them and urged them onward at their utmost speed. Don Conrado, who kept near, behind, had heard the priest's voice, and drew close to the carriage. When Pierre whip- ped up he sprang upon the foot-board, while,   Carlos came on at a rapid rate through the cen- tre of the street. "It is singular a fiacre should not know the way about the city," said the priest. "Perhaps the boy's directions were not under- stood. But we shall soon reach the place, at this rate." Pierre now whirled from the south plaza street round upon the broad, open levee, and began to dash across it at a rapid trot. At the sound of the wheels on the planks, both Father Clement and Gertrude uttered an exclamationof surprise, and looked out of their respective windows. "We are on the levee!" he exclaimed. "And approaching the river!" she responded. "What can this mean? Speak to the man,- father, I beseech you!"  / "What ho! Cocher! garcon! stop your horses I Where are you taking us? This is not the way!" Pierre,-instead of replying, laid on his whip without ceasing. The fiacre in a few seconds wheeled sharply round a post on which was placed the signal lantern, and drew so suddenly up on the verge of the pier, that the horses were nearly thrown down upon their haunches. In an instant de Beltran was at the door. "There is mischief here l" said the priest to Gertrude, as the fiacre stopped, and he saw the light, the boat and men, and Don Conrado's hand on the door. "Heaven protect me! Another danger I!" she cried. "What can be done '?" "I will defend you, daughter," answered Fa- ther Clement, seizing the cutlass by the blade; but before he could grasp the handle, the door was opened, and  he was seized by de Beltran, whose iron strength pinioned his arms to his side, while Carlos, through the forward window 1 threw a handkerchief over his mouth and adroitly ( tied it behind in a sailor's knot; he was then in a an instant rendered incapable of calling for aid, or giving any; with a cord two men tied his a hands and dragged him out, while Don Conrado a sprang into -the carriage. But Gertrude, who c did not lose-her presence of mind, leaped from i the opposite door as he entered; for she recog- c nized Don Conrado, and now clearly understood that she herself, and not Father Clement, was ( the destined victim of the assault, or her gener- r ous spirit would have prompted her to have re- g mained to offer him what aid she could. Like a deer she started from the carriage in flight, but, last, was in ten steps eught in the arms of In   the two men who had kept behind, but whom the speed of the fiacre had outrun. "Just in season, men," cried de Beltran, as he took her in his arms, and placing a hand firmly upon her mouth to prevent her from giving any alarm. In a moment he had borne her to the C boat. "All aboard, and, bend to your oars for your lives, men!" he commanded, as he stood upon the centre thwart. The men obeyed with a will, and the barge shot out from the pier like an arrow. Conrado then stepped aft to place his lovely burden in the stern, when he nearly fell, by striking the body of the priest. "Who is this?'" he demanded; for in the darkness it was difficult to distinguish objects. "The priest, senor," answered Carlos. "What was he put in here for?" "We tumbled him, sir, as you didn't tell us what to do with him," answered one of the men, who had assisted in binding his arms. "Overboard with him!" he cried, placing Gertrude upon the seat by his side, with his arm about her waist and his hand still upon her mouth. "Into the water with him!" "No-no--O, do not do so cruel a deed l" cried Dona Gertrude, struggling to speak. "If thou wilt pledge thy word that thou wilt not call for aid, I will save his life and release thy lips." "I promise-only do not murder him 1" she said, with earnestness, as if she forgot her own situation in the imminent danger that hung over the head of the priest, who for her sake had been thus brought into peril. "Wilt thou give thy word, father, if I let thee be unbound, that thou wilt be quiet?" continued Don Conrado, who now that he had Dona Ger- trude in his power,seemed to betray an unusual degree of exultation, "I am disposed on such a  happy occasion as this to be merciful." - Father Clement knew that there was no other alternative than to comply, and signified his assent by a muffled affirmative. Carlos was then ordered to release his mouth and hands, when he took a  seat, by de Beltran's order, on the cross thwart of the stern-sheets. "Don Conrado de Beltran," said Gertrude, "I  know not whJ you have done this gross out. rage. I am in your power; but release your grasp upon my person." "You will spring overboard." "No. I will remain in the boat. I commit myself to the protection of the rirg"n'   "Son," said Father Clement, calmly, " why this violence and wrong? Who art thou, and what is thy object?" "I Silence, priest! Thou, fair Gertrude, mayest talk, and say what thou wilt." "I will also keep silence," she answered; "but first I will ask thee if thou didst form a plot to get me into thy power; for I see that he who brought me the message is in the boat, and one of thy creatures? Does Captain Clifford lay at the point of death?" ( I will not torture thee, fair Gertrude. He is doubtless doing as he has done at any time. The note you received was written by me! the messenger sent by me! the fiacre engaged by me I - And deeper stratagem than this I would have resorted to had this failed. One would risk all, and set all his wits at work to possess a prize like thee!" Gertrude's relief at hearing of the welfare of Clifford produced such a joyful effect upon her spirits, that for the moment she seemed to for- get her own condition in the power of a bad man whom she despised, and, as she had truly said, feared. "Thou hast confessed to a wicked crime, evil man," said Father Clement. "How couldst thou have the heart to do this thing, and tear this young and trusting  maiden from her father's house, under the cover of so dark a falsehood!" "If thou speakest again I will have thee gag- ged, sir priest," said de Beltran, with anger. "Give way, men!  Let us not be all night in reaching the brigantine!" The oarsmen pulled hard and strong, and the boat, deeply laden as it was, descended the river rapidly.  The dark outlines of the house-tops in the city, as it was left, gradually disappeared ( in open fields, or were changed to forests. The moon   arose about the time the boat left the  quay, and its light revealed the dark shore and here and there a vessel at, anchor in the river. s But all was silent around them. Swiftly they a passed villa after villa, until they came in sight X of the battle-ground. Here they saw a light on e the shore, and people moving about as if ema-  barking. Conrado fancying this might indicate pursuit, pulled further over towards the opposite n shore, encouraging his men with promises of re-  ward. But the people on shore, doubtless, had e other affairs, as they did not give chase to g them. At length, on turning a point, about an hour 8 after midnight, they came in sight of around red. ^   z light, that seemed to shine from the deck of a I vessel. Upon seeing this, the captain of the brig cried t out with joy: "There is the vessel! We are safe!" Gertrude, who had withdrawn as far-as she i could from the side of Don Conrado, after he b had released her form from the clap of his arm, I had sat so silently all the voyage down, with her eye upon the water, that he believed she slept; and as she made no reply to his question' 3 upon this point, his belief was confirmed. Father Clement also sat enveloped in his cowl, his hand parentally holding that of Gertrude, who had sought this sign of sympathy in her woe. So long as she was near this good man, she did not feel so desolate. She did not fall asleep, however. Her thoughts were upon her situation and its probable issue. That she was completely F in Don Conrado's power, she painfully felt; and she knew that he who had risked so much to, get possession of her would not lightly resign her. She tried to be calm, and reflect upon every feature of the circumstances in which she was placed. But the result of all was that she was in the power of a bad man, and had no hope of safety or release but by putting her fall trust and confidence in Heaven. "I will look to God for aid!" she said, reso- lutely, and with Christian faith. "The wicked are in his hands, and they can do no more than he permits! Sweet Maria, mother! Holy vir- gin intercede for me. Ave Maria, pray for me!" With this prayer her soul became calmer. She felt that Heaven will not forsake those who trust it; and this assurance brought a serenity to her heart that she could havre derived from nothing earthly. The father, meanwhile, was deliberating what ought to be done for her rescue. He hoped when they reached the vessel to which the boat seemed bound, he could there speak with him alone, and prevail upon him to release the maiden. At all issues he determined he would defend her from wrong with his life, if need were. The thoughts of Don Conrado were by'no means agreeable. He was elated at his success, but he felt that he had debased himself in the eyes of the very woman whose esteem he would give the world to possess. He felt that she despised him, and he thought that if he could see her face, its handsome mouth would be curled with scorn and derision, rather than trembling   with fear. He was, therefore, humbled and dis- satisfied with himself, yet the thought of re- versing his 'conduct by ever surrendering her, did not occur to him for an instant. His pas- sion for her was stronger than his humility or self-dissatisfaction. The boat drew near the brigantine, which was at anchor over her bows, with her topsails loose, and her jib and spanker set, ready for a run at a three minutes' notice. "Boat ahoy i" hailed Lieutenant Randolpho, from the gangway. At the hail both the priest and Gertrude looked up and gazed anxiously at the brig. By the light of a battle-lantern, held by some one mid- ships, they beheld several men about the side- ladder. Conrado had answered the hail promptly,   and as the boat pulled up alongside, there was a murmur of voices when the rays of the light fell on a female figure in the boat I The boat touched the brigantine, and being secured by ready hands, Don Conrado was about to take Gertrude in his arms to convey her on board; for the deck was so low that it was but a step or two into the vessel from one of the guns. "No. I will go on board, if I must, unaided," she said, shrinking from  his touch. "Father, your hand!" The next moment she stood upon the deck of the brigantine, clinging to the side of Father Clement, and gazing around her upon the crowded and armed decks with her first emotions of positive fear.   CHAPTER XIX. GERTRUDE ON BOARD THE BRIGANTINB.   THE captain of the brigantine had no sooner reached the deck of his vessel, than he gave or- ders to weigh anchor and make sail. All was instantly bustle and noise from stem to stern. The commands of the lieutenant were heard above the songs of the men heaving up the an- chor, and amid the rattling of cordage and the creaking of yards. "Senora," said Don Conrado, in a somewhat overbearing manner, approaching her as she stood clinging to the priest on the very spot where she had first stepped on the deck. 1"Sir, I am in your power," she answered, with the most touching helplessness. "I wait your commands!" The tone of her voice seemed to move him. It did in truth penetrate to his heart. He drew near to her respectfully, and said in a kinder voice: "Do not be alarmed! I intend you no harm. This vessel and its commander are all at your service, save-" "Then let my commands be obeyed to take me back to my father!" "Save that, lady I You may not return un less-" "Go on, sir 1" "Unless you return the bride of Coarado de Beltra n?   She uttered a slight exclamation of horror, and seemed to tremble from head to foot. Poor maiden! she felt like a person in the den of a lion, where the least false movement may cause him to rend her in pieces. "I know I offend you! But your ears must familiarize themselves to these words. Senora, you will descend into the cabin!" "Yes, I obey! Father Clement, you will not leave me!" "No, daughter!" answered the priest, in a low voice, the resolute sound of which gave her courage. "The father may accompany you. I will treat him kindly for your sake, senora. Perhaps his presence on board is a lucky omen! for when thou shalt consent, there will be no need to send for a priest!" These last words were intended for her ear, but were heard by the father, who felt re- assured by them, and dismissed in part from his mind apprehensions that had troubled him of a more lawless course of conduct on the part of their captor than these words indicated. Lean- ing on the arm of the priest, Gertrude, because she could not do otherwise, descended to the cabin. It had been prepared for her reception, being brilliantly lighted, and refreshments set out upon the marble sideboard,   The ngnificence of the cabin filled the priest with surprise; but Gertrude seemed to feel that it was like decking the altar for sacrifice; for she had resolved, that unless Conrado restored her to her father, she would take her own life, and pass pure from this world of vice. The consciousness that this last resource of inno- cence in despair remained to her, nerved her to bear up under her present condition, and to be composed. Don Conrado noticed the sur- prise with which the priest surveyed the ele- gance of the two state-rooms, and smiling, said: "Though I have stolen the bird from its nest, father, I have prepared a gilded cage for her 1" The priest gazed on the tall and truly noble figure of the buccaneer, and upon his handsome, dark face shaded by hair slightly sprinkled with gray, as those features and person were revealed on his removing his cloak and hat, with more curiosity than alarm. "Son," he said, " thou hast the appearance of being a man of rank and influence. How  is it that you have done this outrage?  How hath the maiden harmed thee?  Who art thou?" "The maiden's lover, sir priest. In distant lands I wooed her, and she treated me with scorn. I have sought her over the sea, and again laid a my heart at her feet. I humbly sued for a smile. She treated me as if I had been a slave-ay- t worse, an outcast I I have therefore taken her without her will! Thou  hast now the whole 1 tale in brief! How dost thou like it?"  "Not at all, my son! Thou hast done a ' grievous wrong. The affections of a  woman v are not to be won by violence such as this! If s thou wouldst do right, ere thy vessel sails, send s her back to her father. I do not plead for my- l self; for so that she is returned I am in thy hands to do what thou wilt with me."    ii "  Sir priest, stop thy prating! Once for all I tl swear to thee by the crucifix on thy heart, that o I  will never release this maiden I She is in my a power. This vessel, and its crew, only live to es do my bidding. No 'power on earth can rescue her! Yet I  am willing to kneel at her'feet and a implore her pity upon my love I If she relent or ft look kindly on me, I   will be her slave; if she he does not, I  will teach her that I am  her lord I w As for you, priest, I will let you remain in the w vessel. I  may want you, for I seek only honor. be able love!  This room is yours,senora. No one sw is to enter it without your permission.

I have been too deeply wounded by her er pride to show mercy, or flinch from my purpose. to Lady, there are refreshments. You can retire r- whensoever you choose. Adios!" e.  Thus saying, Don Conrado ascended to the [: deck. All the while he was speaking Gertrude It, moved not a muscle of her face. She sat pale on the fauteuil, where four days before we intro. e duced Guido to the reader. She began to realize e, the irresistible fate that was before her. She h began to comprehend the full' wretchedness of d her lot. Either she must become the bride of e deBeltran,ordie!   The nuptial couch of the man of all m.:n she most detested, or the grave I f She sat immovable with despair. When Don t Conrado had gone on deck, when his form was 1 no longer before her eyes, she gave utterance to a low, pitiful cry, and then with a suffocating t gasp she fell insensible into the arms of the com-  passionate priest. He bore her to the ottoman, [ supported her head on his shoulder, prayed fer- , ently to Heaven for her, and then tried to re- store her to consciousness. "And why should I wish to bring her back to life?" he said,'as he gazed upon the marble face, as still as if it were the face of the dead. "Better, if she is to live to be the wife of this man, who is no doubt a  pirate chief, that her pure spirit should leave the body now. She is insen. sible to her woe I Take her, holy Mary I take her virgin soul to thy bosom in peace!" At this moment, as the brigantine swung round in coming to the wind, a strong breeze blew in through the stern windows, tossing the tresses of her hair about her head, and brought her to animiation. She sighed deeply, and opening her eyes, gazed wildly around. "Where am I  ' Father, my dear father, what a dream I have had 1"She spoke, as if not yet fully aware where she was, and as if supposing herself in her own father's house.  I thought I was taken from you by that terrible man in whom you have so much confidence, and that he bore me to his pirate ship, and that he fearfully swore that I should become his bride, and-." She stopped full. She heard the noise of the rushing keel, the clatter of cordage, the voices on the deck, and one hurried look about her   told her that her supposed dream was not a  dream, but a fearful reality. "Is it you, Father Clement O, I thought, I thought I was at home I But I know where I am now. It is not a dream. Would it were, would it were--from which I might never awake ." "Be calm, daughter. Heaven will protect you. I feel it.. Try and put your trust in the holy angels. This bad man's counsel respecting you shall never prosper." (' Your words give me strength." "I mean they shall. Do not fear. Occupy the room he has pointed out to you. It has but this one entrance, before which I will sleep. Providence has sent me with you to protect you." "I do feel it to be so. Without you--" "Ah, my innocent lamb, without me yourfate would have been indeed pitiful: But I am but one. I can only aid you through my faith. In this I am strong, and it gives me confidencde that we shall both escape this man's hand! Eat  Here are God's gifts, and do not refuse them; for you need health and courage to endure. Let me recommend cheerfulness, and patience, and courtesy towards our captor. On our side we have right, and therefore are his superiors, and he feels it. Show no fear, but serene submission to your fate, and I have no doubt'all will be well. We must gain time by every means in our power. Who knows what a day may bring forth I! To-morrows ever bring changes. Let us hope!" With these words of consolation and courage, the good priest bade her good night, after bless- ing her and solemnly committing her to the pro- tection of Him who never ceases to watch over those who are in danger. "One word, daughter," he added, as she was about leaving him i " you have known this man, and have told me something of his history. Have you any idea where this vessel is bound?." "No-but yes, I recollect hearing him tell my father that when he left New Orleans he should go to Alvarado, on the Mexican coast, where he said he held an estate. But my father supposed he was in a vessel-of-war, and had no suspicion of the truth." "Then let us keep heart I Alvarado is not many days' sail; and if we can keep him in favor (for it is our duty to mislead him if need be), till then we may find means of escape." Dona Gertrude then retired to the inner cabin.   It was lighted by a soft argand lamp, and was furnished with a luxuriance that vied with Ori. ental voluptuousness. She saw that across the two cabin-windows iron bars were placed, which, while they prevented access, prevented egress, should she be tempted to seek a grave in the sea. A guitar, books, prints, and elegant bijou- terie adorned this boudoir. It also contained a rich wardrobe, that a princess might have covet- ed. But her eye rested upon no object with pleasure, but rather with loathing. Closing the door, she kneeled and committed herself, in her desolation, to the protection of the virgin and Heaven. Overcome with fatigue, she fell asleep as she was praying, and with her lovely face laid upon her arm, over which her abundant dark hair richly flowed, she slept in holy repose through the watches of the night. Father Clement finding  all quiet within, ascended to the deck. The moon and -stars were rivalling each other in the splendor of their radiance. Orion bore his glittering standard in mid sky, and the Pleiades were hanging like golden grapes in the bending west. Aldebaran burned like a diamond, in his brilliant triangle; Sirius flashed like a beacon blazing above the gates of Paradise, and Arcturus, as he rolled around the pole in solar splendor, blazed like a lesser sun. The eyes of the father as he cast them heavenward, on first reaching the deck, took in all this glory of the night, and he could not help moving his lips and saying.: "The heavens declare thy glory and the firma- ment showeth thy wondrous works!" Don Conrado approached him and said: "How fares it with thy charge, holy priest '" "She is calmer, and sleeps!" "That is good news!  To-morrow, I doubt not, she will look upon me with a more friendly eye." "Son, not while thou art playing the tyrant towards her," answered Father Clement. "I know not thy condition or pursuit, but it seems unworthy a gentleman to resort to stratagems like this to obtain the ,possession of a ladyl Hast thou no fear of God?" "Preach not to me, priest. By the massl Thou dost presume on my forbearance too much. Dost thou know that I can have thee killed with a  word?" "Thou canst kill only the body, and after that there is no more that thou canst do, son!" "I will put thee in irons if you speak more to- me. Listen, father I If thou desirest to console   the lady with thy presence, do not anger me. If you are discreet, you shall be free on board to see her when you will ; but if you interfere with me or my plans, I will have thee ironed and thrust into the lowest hold of the brig! A word to a wise man should suffice." Father Clement, finding that words would only prevent him from doing service to Gertrude, closed his lips, and resolved to leave events in the hand of Heaven. He walked to the side of the vessel and looked around. The brigantine was under full sail, moving swiftly down the stream. The watch had been set on the fore- castle, and the officer of the deck paced up and down the larboard side, amidships, with his care. ful glance wandering constantly over the sails, spars -and ropes, or the shores and the course the vessel was sailing.  Nothing escaped his vigi- lance.                    I Don  Conrado, after  the conversation he had held with the priest, leaned moodily over the stern- and gazed down upon the rippling wake of the gliding vessel, which was lighted up byj the rays of light that came from the cabin-win-  dows which opened into the apartment occupied 1 by Gertrude. His thoughts were upon her. He s reflected upon the act he was being guilty of. i But he defended it on the plea of his ardent love I for her.  "And did he really love Gertrude  ."- t asks some fair reader of this tale. Yes, without n doubt, he loved her. From the beginning, four s years before, when he first beheld her, in Spain, a   few evenings after she had quitted the convent si in Castile, where she had been educated, he had a loved her. She wag then scarcely passed fifteen, and he was thirty-seven. But the sight of her' st kindled in his heart a   passion which nothing w could diminish. It was at a  festival given by zi Don Garcia on the occasion of his daughter's et   f introduction to the world, that he first beheld  her. Conrado at that time was, as we have said, an officer in the Spanish navy, and being of a noble family, he held a position of influence in society that his rank as lieutenant alone would not have, confirmed upon him. The vessel which he was then acting commander of, was lying in a port two leagues from the abode of Don Gar- cia, when he received the invitation to be present at thefete. When he entered the stately hall, and beheld the youthful queen of the evening seated upon a throne, surrounded by lovely maidens, herself the loyeliest of all, like the moon encircled by stars, he bowed before her in almost admiring  homage. We have said that he was a handsome man, with a striking and noble air, which was clouded on a nearer view only by a cold and sinister light in his eye, and a scarcely perceptible contraction of the nether lip, such as unconscientious men often exhibit to the close observer. But Gertrude was then no judge of character by expression-no analyzer of the face, to detect and recognize the well com- bined poison from the virtues. He devoted him- self to her during the evening. Ee flattered her; he caused her to feel that he was pleased with her; he used every means of sagacious and prac- tised art of courtesy and gentle attentions tO make her pleased with him. In this he was un- sciously aided by her father and others. "Look  out for .thy little heart, daughter," smilingly said Don Garcia;  " el Senor Lieuten. ant de Beltran is a dangerous man." "You have made an easy conquest, senorita," said an old baron, patting her on the shoulder with his little finger, on which blazed a Bra- zilian diamondi    "Don Conrado seems fairly ensnared."   CHAPTER XX. A REMNISOINCOE OF BY-GONE DAYS.   But there was one speaker that made a deeper impression upon the mind of Dona. Gertrude even, than did these words of approbation. As she was passing from the hall, after the festival, to seek her own apartments, out of the shadows of the passage stepped a female, who said in a low, but warning tone: "Maiden I beware of Conrado de Beltrmn!" "Why?" she asked, with a sudden coldness at her heart. ' 'There is gallt in hit hart, There is blood on his blade, Thy peace will depart If thou love him, faf maid; Woe, woe to thee, lady, If thou remember him more."  The woman, in whom Gertrude recognized a fortune-teller who wandered from castle to castle, then disappeared, leaving a chill upon the soul of the lovely girl. Nevertheless, she thought of the handsome Don Conrado till she fell asleep, and-then dreamed that he was leading her to the altar, where, instead of a priest, therdestood about the altar seven murdered cqorpses, each pointing with skeleton fingers to Don Conrado, and calling on Heaven to avenge them on their murdiwer. Three of these Gertrude saw were young, and had been lovely. She awoke with a shriek ofthorror. The: next day Don Contado called at the-   castle, and though at first- she thought of her dream and the witch's words, and was in great fear, the fascination and cheerfulness of Don Conrado, her father's confidence in him, his efforts to please her, overcame her fears, and dis- missing from her mind these things, she suffered herself to be pleased, as she had been the eve- ning before, with his attentions. Day after day these visits were renewed, till closer intimacy made the pure girl conscious of the wickedness of his spirit, and the continual impurity of the thoughts of his heart. Like all bad men, he believed that returned love in a .female is the challenge to last; and that love cannot exist without sensuality. But. he had to learn, as many a lover like him has had to learn since, that love in the heart of woman is a holy and pure flame; that it is wholly dissociated from those grosser imaginations which characterize it in the bosoms of most men; that it is a sentiment born of the spirit within, and seeks only the sympathy of a kindred spirit. Such was the nature of the passion which was being awakened in the virgin bosom of Dona Gertrude towards this dangerous and captivating man, so much her senior, when believing that requited Jove is surrender of deli- cacy and' honor, he took one step too far, and she fled from him as alarmed as an angel would have been to have found anhother angel drop the   angelic appearance, and disclose the dark form of a devil. Nay, she was more than alarmed-- her maiden delicacy. had received a shock that deeply wounded her. She sought the solitude of her room, and there wept for hours; wept that she could have been deemed so unworthy as to be thus insulted by him whom she supposed the soul of honor; wept that the noble form on which she was about to lean, the oak about which she was ready to entwine, should turn to a serpent I should seek to destroy, rather than to honor and protect. It was in vain Don Conrado soutght an inter- view with the insulted and high-souled girl. His notes she returned unopened; and when Don Garcia, to whom Don. Conrado made an appeal, well knowing the daughter had too much pride to tell the father the real truth, endeavored to reconcile them, she was firm in refusing ever to see him again. At length he departed in his ship. He was gone a year. During this period the witch wo-.  man had seen her and unfolded to her the real' 1 character of Don Conrado, for she had been his E foster-mother. She told her how he had slain a in a quarrel, in boyhood, her own son, his foster- 1 brother. How, as a young man, he had wronged t the helpless, and tyrannized, as a man, over those c who were in his power. She then alluded to c some stories that had of late got abroad, of his t having replenished his wasted coffers by means a unbecoming   an officer; and that he had been .s arrested after his departure from the castle, after h the fete, by the queen's order. This intelligence tc had   also been communicated to Don Garcia, ai from other sources; but it was also stated that th he,had acquitted himself. This, however, was a not the case. The queen, however, out of re- it gard to the reputation of her officers, did not in publicly condemn  him i but having admonished th him, suspended him for a   year. During this :of year, his time  was passed chiefly in Turkey, -ca where it was said, with truth, that he became T . partner with a  Greek buccaneer. This mode of be life so chimed with his tastes, that after he re- so turned to Spain and took command of a   small co sloop-of-war, he felt a strong disposition to bue- pa caneer in the queen's vessel.  but he resisted it ch for a  time, and sailed to revisit Dona Gertrude. bri But he found that time had only served to in- ne, crease the distance between them. He, there. he fore, reluctantly and angrily took his departure, ha s and in this mood, after a few weeks, yielded to I the temptation o  takethe Yessel freighted with Ca   m silver, we have already alluded to. With this - wealth, he resolved to resign the service, in which, at he well knew, he could not remain when his le crime became known. But his resignation did it not shield him from the displeasure of the o crown. He was banished from Spain, and his e estates confiscated, and even the silver he had n captured, seized and taken from him. This step Lt only was wanted to complete his transformation o into a buccaneer. With a small vessel, manned 1 by a score or two of those desperadoes that can always be picked up in the maritime towns of - the Mediterranean, fIe sailed on adventures at s sea. After-making several bold captures in the L vicinty of the straits, and finding that he was , being noticed by inquisitive cruisers, he took to i the bay of Biscay, where he captured a French gun-brig by stratagem, and deserting his smaller , vessel, he hoisted his flag upon her, keeping as many of her crew as chose to sail under- it, and landing the rest near Bordeaux. He now placed himself in the track of English vessels, captured 'two brigs, but without much profit. He  then scoured the Irish channel, entered the North Sea, and after various adventures, and but little gold, he squared away his yards and steered towards the equator. Here the idea occurred to him of capturing slave ships, when near the Brazilian coast, and disposing of the cargoes himself in the Rio Janeiro market. He found this a profit- able speculation for a gentleman in his circum- -stances; and after' continuing it/ a year and a half, he amassed so much wealth, that he resolved to go to the island of Cuba, purchase an estate, and spend there the rest of his days. But as they approached Cuba, he was fallen in with:by an English cruiser, who gave chase. The Eng- lishman, coming within gun range, fired a shot into her, and caused her to leak so badly that they had to run her ashore on the south side of the island in the. nighti, which, fortunately came on in time to conceal them from the fe. The brig had to bewhurned the next day, but;not ' before he took from her the most of his inoyin some of it not being able, to be reached :on; ac. count of the depth of water in the hold. ' With a part of the money he went, to Havana and pur- chased the beautiful vessel which he namef the brigantine. In her he continued his old buccao, neering, in order th replace by capture the wealth he had been compelled to leave in the vessel he had lost. Forl more than a year, under the name of Captain Belt,.he cruised, about thoeCaibbeF,'   Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and even once crossed the ocean, in a long chase of a Mexican silver ship, and boldly entering the straits of Gibraltar, landed near the castle of Don Garcia, with the daring intention of carrying off Dona Gertrude. Upon finding she had, with her father, left Spain to reside on their estates in Cuba, he once more spread his sails for the western world, in the track of Columbus. On reaching Cuba, he learned that Don Gar- cia had been banished on the suspicion of having favored the invasion; and having learned whither he had gone, he set sail fdb New Orleans; but not until he had landed on the southwestern shores of the Gulf, in order to look after a de- posit of gold and silver, which he had placed in a deserted stone temple of the Aztecs, that stood romantically situated upon, a promontory, and which few seldom visited, except fishermen from Alvarado, and these only when compelled by a storm to put in there; for there were traditions, by no means of a pleasant character, connected with the majestic and hoary ruin. It was from this place that the brigantine took her departure, and which she had left five days before the eve- ning we first discovered her approaching, under shortened sail, the Balize of the Mississippi. We have already seen the result of Don Con- rado's visit to the city, and leaving him, leaning over the taffrail of his vessel, forming plans of triumph and of delight in the possession of his lovely captive, we will let the brigantine go on her way down the river, and enter upon the open Gulf,' across which, we' leave her to steer her course for the temple of the sun. The reader will have missed from the vessel one ef theipersonages of our tale, and has, no doubt, been expecting him to make his appear. ance in the preceding scenes. We allude to Guido. It will be recollected that, having en- tered into an engagement to paint a miniature of Dona Gertrude, he went to-his hotel, intending, the ensuing day, to call on Captain Clifford. This call was made, and Clifford received him with that warmth of friendship which had sprung up mutually in their breasts, the day before. "I have written a  note to the lady, senor," said Clifford, who was on this day so well as to be able to sit up, supported by pillows. " She has promised her consent, and you are to go to the house this day; but it must be managed very privately, as she wishes, when the picture is completed, to surprise her father with it. You wiU, therefore, at twelve o'oeook, follow r  sert   vant, who will be here to guide you to her resi- dence. Are your pencils ready?" "All ready, senor captain," answered Guido, who felt no little interest in carrying out an ad- venture that seemed to promise so much ro- mance. At twelve o'clock Gaspar arrived from Dona Gertrude, and Guido, taking leave of his I friend, was conducted by the faithful Cuban ser-. vrant to the Casa Grande. He was ushered into i the drawingsroom, and after waiting a few mo- i ments, Gaspar showed him  into her boudoir. Gertrude, on beholding so handsome a young man, started with some confusion, and seemed as surprised as if she did not look for his coming. Clifford had merely said that "an artist of! merit ' was to call to take her picture; and her imagination conjured up a middle-aged, sedate person, bald-headed, with spectacles. She could hardly believe Gaspar, until he repeated twice that it was the painter. She then received him with charming courtesy, and although still em-l barrassed to see so handsome a youth seat him- self before her and gaze into her face and intoe her eyes, she tried to submnit to it with gravity, for the sake of Clifford. An hour passed. Don Garcia had gone out: with de Beltran to dine, and they were not in- terrupted. In that hour they became very well acquainted, and there is no kind of doubt but they would have fallen in love, if Gertrude's' heart had not been immovably pre-occupied by the indelible image, deeper limned than artist's pencil could paint, of Edward Clifford, and if his heart also had   not- months before beenu taken captive by  a beautiful American girl, whom he had met at Havana. Guido, on returning to Clifford, was in raptures at the grace and beauty of his sitter; and indeed; spoke so enthusiastically, that it all at once struck him that Clifford might be inclined to look upon him in some   sort as a rival. He,  therefore, on his next-visit, before going to Casa Grande, took occasion to inform him of his ex-. isting attachment to an almost unknown Ameri- can girl, whom he had met seven months before in Cuba, and whose image had never been absent from his thoughts. Clifford could not help con- gratulating him upon their happiness, and said that he trusted it would be completed by his i union, some day, with the lovely object of his attachment; "Ah, senor captain," sighed Guido, "H dare not hope. I am poor. She is an heiress, I have heard, She was he niece of a  commodore who   was there With his frigate. It was at the opera I beheld her. I sat in the next box. She let fall by accident hier fan into the box where I sat. I picked it up, and when I returned it, our eyes met! During an interlude I noticed she stole a glance towards me. Fromsome cause there was an uproar in the vestibule as ske was leaving for the caniage, leaning on her uncle's arm. She got separated from her protector, and before he could rescue her, several men had rushed be. tween them. I drew her arm in mine, and es. corted her to the street, with no little difficulty.   At the carriage I received her's and her father's thanks. They left Havana the next day, and I have not seen her since.'" "And her name V" "I only know that it is Mary. But I have her picture. I took it from memory. I wear it next my heart 1"As he spoke, he took a locket from his bosom, and showed it to Clifford. Glancing at the face, he exclaimed: It is my sister, Guido I It is my sister Mary. AIe was my uncle, the commodore. Let us be brothers 1"   CHAPTER XXI. THE EARLY HSTORY OP GUIDO.   THE pleasing discovery with which we have terminated our last chapter, immediately bound the two young men to each other in the most friendly bonds, and if Guido was overjoyed to find in his new friend the brother of the lovely unknown, Clifford, on his part, was extremely gratified to discover in the handsome young art- ist, to whom he had become so much attached, one who had met his sister, and love her. They sat and talked over the absent and be- loved one, and Edward assured Guido that so far as he knew, she was heart-free. "But," he added, fixing his eyes upon the noble form of his friend with a look of reproachful inquiry, " you have not removed the veil of mystery which envelopes you. You know all about me-that I am an officer of the United States army, wounded and in love. Of thyself I know nothing, save that thou art, as thou sayest, an artist, and a  stranger here."  "Do you doubt whether I am an artist, Senor f Clifford?"', asked Guido, with a smile.  b "Not exactly; but I think you have not I always been one "  "Itis true. Listen to me. I feel that I can e confide my story to you. It is not long, but it ei may interest you; and so that -it secures your in confidence in me for the future, I shall be re. n warded in telling it." "I listen with pleasure, senor."      8 Know, then that I am a Castilian by birth. he   e My father was a nobleman, and a member of ad the cortes of the realm. He married a sister of st Count Conrado de Beltran, who was also a noble, to and at one time held high rank in the navy of ly Spain. My father died in my infancy; and I ly was educated by my mother, who, with the true t- devotion of a Spanish mother, devoted to me all a, her time, and lavished upon me all her affection. She dwelt, for my sake, in my father's secluded - castle, and drew thither for my improvement the o best masters in languages, music, painting, phi- e 108osophy, sciences, fencing, and armsn, that could s be obtained. Thus I grew up skilled in all the i accomplishments becoming a gentleman of my i rank, and the pride and glory of my mother. IMy chief taste was in painting and music, and these I cultivated for my own pleasure, after my teachers had ceased to give me lessons. The first picture I painted was the noble faceof my beloved mother. I had hardly completed it be. fore she became ill, and  shortly died on my bosom, and in the presence of my uncle Conrado. I willnot portray t o you the anguish of my emotions in losing this only true friend.  She seemed to me a part of my stable things of the  earth, as if she whould ever live and be with me; indeed, I could not have been more surprised or missed it more, if the sun had suddenly gone out. I  had never known life without myrmother's sharing its every moment with me, and Without her it seemed no longer life.   -"But time, which heals all wounds, healed the a severity of mine. My uncle, with whose, manly x form and warlike profession my youthful imagi- s nation was taken, invited me to accompany him on a voyage to see the world, in order to re- v move from my mind the bitterness of my loss. . He painted in such glowing tints the splendor of the ocean at sunrise, its silvery radiance by c moonlight, its sublimity in a storm, its terrible- t ness at midnight, when lashed by the wild winds, ] the variety of the ever-changing climes and  shores, they captivated me, and I consented to 1 embark with him on a voyage; and more espe- cially, as it was ascertained that the estate I in-! herited was under embarrassments that it would require something more than its rental to re- i move. As my uncle held out to me, also, the prospect of gain as well as pleasure, I committed myself to his direction, and embarked with him. This was nearly two years ago. I have said that he had been an officer of rank in the navy. I supposed him to be so still, and knowing but little of naval matters, I did not discover any peculiarity in the vessel which I went on board of. It was small, but elegant, and its cabins richly furnished. We set sail. He gave to my use his luxurious state-rooms, and did all in his power to contribute to my happiness. For a year we cruised from sea to sea, and land to land. During this period we attacked and cap- tured many vessels, and I fought by his .side, zealous for the glory of my country. I believed then that these vessels, thus taken, were the ene- mies of Spain, and that all these captures had been made legally by a Spanish naval ship, un- der a Spanish naval officer l" "And did you discover to the contrary?" asked Clifford, with surprise. "Y Yes. And in this way. We had fallen in with a vessel which was sailing under the Spanish. flag. To this we gave chase; when I pointed out the national colors, my uncle smiled, and said to me: "' Guido, it is quite time you understood my position and your own, too. I have studiously kept from you the facts; but you will learn them, and perhaps not under such favorable circum- stances as you- can heaw them now. Know, then, that I sm no longer in the Spanish navy, nor have I been since you came on board this vessel. I am not even a Spaniard any longer./ Some things I chose to do of my own free will dis- pleased the queehn, and I have been dismissed from the service, and outlawed. This vessel is   afree courser of the dark, blue sea. She owns no flag, respects no flag I Vessels of all nations are alike to her, so that they contain wealth! 4"In a word,' said I, ' you are a buccaneer, uncle.' "' Exactly, Guido,' he calmly answered." "It would be impossible, Captain Clifford, to convey to you my feelings. I did not question the truth of his statement. Fifty things that had4 passed on board, now came rushing to my mindi confirming all. I did not hesitate to make known to him my sense of the wrong he had done me, and demanded at once to be left on the nearest shore. But he laughed, and said that I was very fastidious, since I had been quite as active in the captures he had made; and was as fully committed to a life of piracy as himself. I plead in excuse that I supposed that I was fight- ing for my native land against its foes. "The result was, I felt that I must Submit till a' more favorable time, to my fate; for he threat- ened that if I attempted to leave without his consent, he would inform the authorities of the land where I should debark, that I was a pirate. I now saw the wicked character of my uncle in its true light, and finding that discretion dictated silence and forbearance till a more fitting time should offer to leave him, I feigned resignation to my destiny ,--At length we were chased and driven on shore on the coast of Cuba. Here I would have effected my escape, but he now re- vealed to me that he was the Captain Belt-" 1 "Captain Belt!" exclaimed Clifford, starting up with surprise. "Is it possible he was that notorious pirate" " "( Yes, senor. He told me that he saw that I would leave him if I could; but that a price was set on his head, and that if I attempted to es- cape, he 'would give information that would bring my head to, the block, as his accomplice. He then said that he was going to Havana to purchase another vessel, and that I might ac- company him, provided I would take an oath to return with him, which, if I would do, he would rreward by releasing me at New Orleans, whither , he intended to go, from further companionship with him. This oath I took, glad even at this remote prospect of escape. e It was while I was r in Havana that I beheld your sister at the opera. "At length we were once more on the sea, B and after visiting a favorite rendezvous on the - coast of Mexico, we sailed for this city, where I we arrived two nights ago."   . "This is an extraordinary visit," said Clifford]   "'Did he come up to the city with his pirate ship?" "Not in sight; but anchored a league below, whence he came to the town." "W+at object could have brought him here?" "Love!" "Love ." "Si, senor., But for one whom I do not-know!" Here Giberto interrupted them by announcing the surgeon; and in few minutes, after waiting to learn that his friend was better, Guido took his leave, promising to resume his history of Don Conrado on the ensuing day. The next morning he had a second interview with Dona Gertrude, and another hour's sitting, varied by delightful conversation; during which, they talked mostly of Edward Clifford. Inthe after noon Guido was once more at his friend's bed side. He here resumed his narrative, broken off the day before. "I do not know the lady, though I think my uncle gave me a name; but in such a way, that I regarded it as fictitious, and paid no heed to I it; for with all my outward complaisance, he E evidently withheld from me his entire confidence. He told me, on arriving here, that if he did not t succeed in wooing, he should steal the maiden. F I tried to dissuade him from such a course, but s in vain; and finally seemed to yield; at the n same time I reminded him of his promise to re. lease me on reaching this city. This he promised 1 to do if I would aid him in his object. 'I his I gave him to believe I would do, on condition he persecuted me no further, and together we came to the city. But this was his second visit, for he had come with his man Tito the previous night, as and had seen you serenading a  lady, who, he hi says, was the lady he came to woo. If this be T so, the fair maiden whom you have sent me to paint her miniature, is the lady!"    hi "Dona Gertrude! Is it possible that he can dare to love her? O, no, he has deceived you, Guido!"  "No. He said that he had followed, attacked, and his servant had wounded the serenader  " ag "  Then it was he who assailed me ! Yes, yes  tr It is all clear now! I was the serenader. He, no then, was the assassin. And has he dared to fix co his thoughts on this noble creature I O, that I to( had a   strong arm to cross blades with him once Ca more, fairly, on this issue!"      her "Ihave believed, nay, almost surely known ple from the first, that you were the rival he had gin attacked ;  and guessed that Dona Gertrude was his 6   ate the Senora de Armas (that was the name) of whom he spoke to me." w,  "Where is this buccaneer chief now?" "I will not betray him. He is my mother's ?i" brother; he has kept his word with me, for I am free, and I would rather another hand than mine should point him out 1" !"  "Nay, if I can find him when i recover, it is ng all I ask." ng  "I will see that you meet, senor, if he be then ok in the city!" of  "I)ona Gertrude must be put on her guard. xt He said he would even carry her off. He is a capable of this wickedness. Guido, thou must ,y see her and warn her! I am bed-ridden--totally sy helpless! Thou must watch over her!" r  "I will do so, sepor! I will watch my uncle, I also, and I do not think he will take any steps If without my knowledge; for he expects me to aid him; and even to escort him as far as his Y brig." t    "Guido, I feel uneasy. This man ought to o be surrendered to the police. Are you doing e right in concealing him?"   "Yes. He has fall knowledge that I could t betray him; yet, trusting to my honor, he has  placed himself in my  power in the city. Be- t sides, his arrest would lead to my own I I could D not hope to escape." "True. He would compromise you at once. Will you watch the house, and watch him ?" "I will, senor." "And will you warn her?" "This very hour, if you say so!" "Tell her not to trust herself to come here again without her father and Gaspar I Nay, tell her to keep at home; that there is danger abroad. Think you she has seen him?" "I am not sure about this. I think my uncle has seen the father." "Don Garcia?" "That is the name. He knew him in Spain. It was in Spain that he first met La Senora." Clifford appeared much distressed; and im- agined a thousand evils as happening to Ger- trude. When the physician came in, he pro- nounced an increase of fever, and forbade further conversation. Guido, promising to protect her, took his leave. He at once proceeded to the Casa Grande; but Gertrude had gone out with her father to see a Castilian lady who contem. plated going soon to Spain, and he could not give her the warning. But he kept much with his uncle, and tried to ocupoytall his time in the   day and late at night; and endeavored to learn from him all that he had accomplished and yet proposed. But Conrado, who saw in his ques- tions an eagerness and closeness, as if they con- cealed a design, began to suspect him, and misled him by pretending that he should succeed in wooing the lady, and that if he didn't, he should leave her for some more favored suitor, adding,   that he had abandoned all idea of carrying her  off. Guido was completely deceived by this du- plicity; and the next day, when he took the sit- ting, he thought it needless to alarm her by a warning against danger that no longer menaced her.   CHAPTER XXTH. C(ONSTERNATION AND FOREBODINGS.   ON the next night following the day on which the conversation recorded in the preceding chap- ter took place, the hapless Dona Gertrude was taken off in the fiacre,: as we have seeni and, when it was all too late, Guido had to discover how painfully he had been duped by his subtle relative. About an hour after our heroine had fallen into the trap which had been set for her, and had been conveyed unrescued on board the boat that was taking her and Father Clement to the brigantine, Don Garcia sat alone in his library, listening to catch the sounds of the carriage, re- turning with his daughter. But as the hour grew late, without seeing her, he began to feel uneasy, recollecting the danger to which she had once before been exposed in the streets of the city. "Gaspar," he called to his servant. "Senor." "Is it not a little strange they should remain 80so long ." "It is two hours and a half, senor. The ride is but a few minutes." "I begin to feel anxious. You had best go and see why they stay, and say to Gertrude that she must return; that she need not remain with the dying man all night because the confessor does so." "Si, senor," answered Gaspar, and immedi- ately left the house on his errand. Upon reaching the street in which Giberto lived, he was surprised, on approaching the shop, to see no carriage standing before it; and his first impression was that they had gone home   by another street. Upon reaching the door, he found it fast, and all still within, a faint light only gleaming from an opening in the curtains of the window over the entrance. "He must be dead, all is so quiet," said Gas- par, within himself. "But where can La Senora be, and Father Clement? I hear no voices on the inside. I will e'en knock." / "Hilloh, hola! Who goes there?" challenged the soldierly voice of the old artilleryman, from within. "It is I, Gaspar, mi amigo! How fares the captain now - Is it all over with him? And when did Dona Gertrude and the priest leave?" While Gaspar was maktning these inquiries through the key-hole, the sergeant was unbar- ring and taking off the chains from the door "What is it, friend Gaspar?" he asked, as he opened to him. "What is this thou sayest about Dona Gertrude and some priest?" "I say when did they leave?" "Who leave i" "My young mistress. Is she up stairs ." "La Senora has not been here." "Nor Father Clement ." "No, amigo." "Is Captain Clifford dead?" "No, amigo Gaspar.. What aileth thee i" "Is he dying ." "By the mass, no! He was up and took cof- fee with me and Senor Guido to-night; and now sleeps soundly. He will be a well man in three days." . "This is very strange I"   "What isvery strange 9" called out Clifford, from the room above; for he had been awakened by the noise made to admit Gaspar. "What is thy errand here?" Gaspar now advanced to the foot of the stairs and said in no little excitement: "Why, you see, senor capitan, they started and came here, as you sent for her, or rather as Giberto wrote for her to come-" "I wrote to her M I have not written to any body, not I." "I did not send for any one," answered Clif- ford. "Tell thy tale plainly. What hath hap- pened ." "Then, if you neither sent, nor Giberto wrote, mischief hath happened. About three hours agone a lad came in a fiacre, bearing a note, which he said Giberto had sent him with--" "I sent no boy, nor note either." "This boy said the note was given him by you, Giberto, and it bore your name; and it sta- ted, for I heard them read it, that Captain Clif- ford was dying, and that he wished to see Dona Gertrude, and therefore the fiacre was sent for her, and that she must not be delayed a minute." "This is all false," cried Giberto. "Do not interrupt him," said Clifford, who had risen and thrown his dressing-gown around him and come down the stairs, his bosom agita- ted with he knew not what pressing weight of coming ill news. "Speak quickly. What more hast thou to say, Gaspar 9" "Dona Gertrude at once went in the fiacre, accompanied by Father Clement, who being at the house at that hour, said he would not fail being at your dying bed, also, he being a con- fessor. So the fiacre drove off; and the father promised at the gate he would return in an hour with Dona Gertrude."  "And--i" gasped Clifford. "And they had not returned when I left home; 1 it is not a quarter of an hour since, though they'  had been gone nearly three hours; so Don Gar- t cia sent me hither to see why they delayed; and  here I find you alll abed, Captain Clifford getting  well, instead of dying, and, no lady nor priest!" i "This is unaccountable,' said Clifford, pale d as the marble. "Who is this Father Clement? r Is it possible that he has contrived this . Is he l an evil man 9" "No, I'll vouch for him," answered Giberto. m "He is a true Holy man."  "None more pious in the world," said Gaspar. c "H is fiftyyerar okd. He wint onlfy to pirec.-   1, herand confess you, whom he supposed to be d dying." "Giberto," said Clifford, whose imagination was at once painfully alive with images of vio- , lence and wrong, of which Gertrude was the helpless victim. He tried, however, to calm d himself. "Giberto, can you unravel this?"  "I can only guess, senor." "And what is your guess!" "That the whole is a plot which has been Esuc cessful, to carry her off by some rival of yours; perhaps by the very man who attempted your life, and who is no doubt a rival." Instantly the conversation which he had had with Guido flashed upon his mind, and he saw Jthe truth at a glance. "You are right. It must be so l" he ex- claimed, in a voice pitched to the profoundest key of anguish. But he was too much of a man, even in his illness, to yield to despair, or aban- don himself to grief. "Giberto, do you know where Guido lives ." "At l'hotel St. Louis, senor." "Hasten to him and bid him to come and see me without delay. You can state to him what has happened, which will hurry him. And you, Gaspar," he added, as Giberto took up his cap and sword, and started at once on his midnight message, "you, Gaspar, probably know where Father Clement lodges?" "Si, senor. In the chapel chambers, not a square from our house." "Go quickly, then, and see if he has returned, and also call on your way by, and ascertain if they have not got back to Casa Grande. Bring me word directly of what you learn." Gaspar at once departed, leaving the love  alone, and a prey to the keenest grief. "There is na hope," he exclaimed, after trying to find some excuse to account for all this mystery. "It is a plan I The note, pretending to have been written by Giberto, the falsehood respecting my condition, these all betray design, alas, but too successfully accomplished. There is no doubt but the fiacre was engaged by Gui- do's uncle, and that she is now in his power- now, perhaps, many leagues from the city; lost, lost, LOST to me forever 1" He buried his, face'in his hands, and sinking upon a bench i'-the shop, he yielded himself up to the bitterest emotions that the soul of a lover can feel.        , . " *. a  t teng he remntltnd in W^'niaittn he   knew not, but was roused from it by the return of Giberto. "What news?" "Guido is not in, senor." ' "Notin!" "The night porter says he has not been in since noon!"  "He was here and left at dark. 'This is very strange." "Perhaps he is the man," said Giberto. "He-Guido, O no I I would hardly believe it did he tell me so. He is the soul of honor." "But he is missing-she is missing I! He has been painting her picture, and seen her every day; perhaps they have run away with each other!" "Silence, man I You wrong both! Thou art but a poor comforter. Ha, here is Gaspar I what hast thou to say? I need not ask. I see evil tidings in thy face." "Father Clement is not at the chapel dormi- tory ; nor has the carriage returned to the house. Here comes Don Garcia, whom I have outrun." "Not been here? Not been here?" he ex- claimed, out of breath. !"No, senor, nor were they sent for," answered Clifford. "Your daughter has doubtless been stolen away, by some fiend! Can you trust Father Clement?" "Yes; he is a pure man. He is with her, and this is a comfort. He will protect her." "Yes, if he is with her it will be a comfort; but they may have slain him.  What, can be done?" "' I know not! Let the alarm be given to the gend'armes. . I will offer a reward of one thou- sand dollars for the fiacre that came to my house, or for any intelligence of my child. Gaspar, call the guard 1" In a few minutes there were five policemen at the door,- to whom Don Garcia made known what had occurred, and doubled his reward for any intelligence of the fiacre or the party it con- tained. The intelligence flew like wildfire through the city, and in twenty minutes not a gend'arme  in the city was ignorant that two thousand dollars would be paid to him who should recognize the. fiacre that had taken away Father Clement and the daughter of Don Garcia from his house. There is nothing like areward, to give vigilance to the steps and acuteness to the apprehensions of policemen. In about one hour a  gend'arme came to the house of Don Garcia, to where, from Giberto's, Cliffordt under   his excitement, had walked with Don Garcia, and where Giberto also was. The gend'arme reported that he had seen a fiacre drive rapidly down one of the streets of the square, and stop at the river; that he heard a scuffle there, and was going to see what it was, when all was quiet again, and the fiacre drove off up the levee. He said that he had no doubt that the parties got into a boat, for he saw no one on the bank after the fiacre drove off; and that it drove off empty he knew by the light rattle of it. "There Wan be no doubt of it," said Clifford. "They have taken her down the river." Don Garcia walked the room a few moments in deep thought. "Captain Clifford, I begin to believe with you that she has been taken off by Don Conrado de' Beltran. What you told me as we came along, that you had heard about him, confirms me. I am satisfied I have been deceived in him. He has carried off my daughter. Is there not a vessel of war in port?' "Yes." "Do you know her commander?" "Well. I will at once Write a note to him to give chase down the river!" "It is the only chance we have of rescuing her. Win her, bring her back to my arms once more, Captain Clifford, and she shall go from my embrace to yours. You shall have her!" "These are words enough to make a well man of me, and give me wings to fly to her rescue," exclaimed Clifford, who really seemed to be a new man, so suddenly had the words endued him with energy. The note was written, and he was about to send it by the gend'arme to the cap- tain of the sloop-of-war, when two policemen en- tered, leading Pierre, the driver of the fiacre, between them. "Here, senor," said one of them, is " the man who drove the carriage. I know him well. He keeps his stable near my beat; and about-twenty minutes to ten o'clock, this night, I saw him drive fast by me to his stable; and as I walked past as he was unhitching, I heard him say to his comrade who stays there, 'I have made one hundred dollars by a runaway job to-night.' So when I heard of the disappearance of Don Gar- cia's daughter, I was sure of the fiacre which had taken her away." "Do you confess this i" demanded Don Garcia of Pierre. "Yest your honor. It is not my fault. I am   a poor diable of a fiacre man. I must go where the gentlemen- bid me; so they pay, I must trot I I was on my stand about dark, when a tall gen. tleman comes up, and after looking at me hard, asks me if I could keep a secret. I told him I could if there was a five-dollar gold piece put on it to keep it down. He then said, ' you are my man,' and placed in my hands fifty dollars in this purse, and said, 'wait you here till you see me again, and you shall have fifty more.' So by- and-by he came again, and I was bid to take up a boy and drive here. Here I took in a priest and a lady, and drove to the foot of --  street, where the gentleman, who had followed behind, came up, gave me another purse, and with two or three men hauled out the priest and tied him, and then threw him into a boat, full of men, while the gentleman jumped in to take the lady out; but she sprang through the other door, and started to run, but he caught her and carried her to the boat, putting his hand on her mouth. 1 he boat then pulled off as fast as they could ,row, and I whipped up and left the place as fast as I could go, for I did not care to be caught in such extra business, knowing where there was so much se- crecy and money, there wasn't much goo6d."   "It is now all plain," said Clifford, with a deep groan. "She is lost I But we will pursue and avenge."   I The policemen being ordered to call the next morning and obtain their rewards, one of them, who left with the rest, hastened to convey Clif- fordd's note to the captain of the sloop-of-war; he was also ordered to come for him in a car- riage, to convey him and Giberto, who refused to quit him, on board. By this time it was break of day; and Clifford, exhausted by excitement, was prevailed upon by Giberto and Don Garcia to repose upon a lounge, where he soon fell asleep. The captain of the sloop, in the meanwhile, returned answer that he would cheerfully comply with his request, but as the sails of the sloop were unbent, it would be night before he could get under weigh. Clifford was not disturbed by Giberto to communicate the contents of the note to him. Don Garcia, in the meanwhile, devoted the time to preparations to accompany Clifford in the sloop-of-war, when she should be ready to sail. At length, about eleven o'clock, Guido unex- pectedly made his appearance at Casa Grande.   CHAPTER   XXITT. A GLEAM OF SUNSHNE AND HOPE.   UrPO waking, on hearing the voice of Guido, Clifford gave utterance to an exclamation of surprise and joy; and while he warmly pressed his hand, the blush of ingenuous shame deep- ened the color of his cheeks; for he had fallen to sleep impressed with the suspicion that Guido had deceived him, and been a party in the ab- duction of Gertrude. His absence seemed to confirm this conjecture, which Giberto took good care to strengthen; for in the mind of the artil- leryman, Guido was at the bottom of the whole affair. "I have heard, my dear friend, of all that has happened, and hastened to give you all the con- solation in my power," said Guido, in accents of sympathy. -"I regret that I did not know it earlier, but I have been called away by a strange adventure. What in your opinion has become of the lady Gertrude?" Here Clifford related briefly all that had trans- pired, and how the fiacre had been traced to the river, where a boat received the party. "Then there is no doubt at all that Don Con- rado has taken her," he answered, his eyes flash- ing with indignation.  ".The traitor, thus to deceive me, and falsify his word; when, if I had not believed him, I might yesterday have given Dona Gertrude warnint But it is not te?3 tt toe pees i    "Too late-too late, I fear altogether too late," answered Clifford, sadly. Here he recollected his note, and inquired if any answer had been returned. Upon learning that the sloop could not sail for some hours, he threw himself upon his couch, and abandoned himself to his grief and to his weakness of frame. "No, no, she is lost, lost to me forever!" he would murmur, from time to time. Guido knelt by him, and tried to soothe him, and said to fiim that they need not wait for the sloop-of-war, but that they could commence the pursuit at once. ^ "At once ." repeated Clifford, looking up and gazing incredulously in his face. "Yes. Will you trust me and be guided by me?" "I will. I sent for you last night, to confide to you my grief." "Then hear what I have to say, my brother and friend," answered Guido, " and you will see there is a bright ray in all this darkness." "I will listen to any words of hope." "I can best tell you what I would relate, by giving you an account of what happened after I had left you last night. Listen also, Giberto, and Don Garcia. I beg you will give heed, that you may all understand what I am to propose." "Who is this gentleman?" asked Don Garcia of Clifford for he had never before seen him.   "It is my true friend, sir, El Senor Guido." "It is enough," answered Don Garcia. "We need all our friends, now." "After quitting you, yesterday, it was not yet twilight, and the. evening soft, and the light of the skies bright and cheerful, I sauntered to- wards the cemetery, and entering it, was en- gaged in looking at the inscriptions, when a man passed me, who stopped, and regarded me so closely, that I fixed my eyes also upon him. We mutually recognized each other; he would have embraced my feet, but I drew him to my heart. It was my foster brother-the son of the peasant woman whom my mother placed me with in my infancy. When the boy, who was as attached to me as if he had been my slave, grew to be nineteen, he got involved in a broil with the nephew of the crown officer of the reve. nue, and wounded him, but not mortally. Nev- ertheless he had to fly, and took to the sea. From that time, four years ago, I have not seen him until I met him in the singular manner I have related. - After the first congratulations of our'meeting were over, I asked him to relate how it was that I had been so fortunate as to encounter him so far from home. He then in- formed me that he had become a sailor, and after i various adventures, had found himself at Matan- 1 Bas, the third officer of a small, fast-sailing  schooner, that run between Cadiz and the West I Indies. This schooner was armed, for she some- . times carried  contraband freight.  She was manned by a  young and daring American by i the name of Frederick Benson, who was idolized t by his men, and who was the soul of courage  and nautical generosity, albeit he would at times cheat the king's revenue. One day, about three f months- ago, said my foster brother, there arrived f at Matanzas a ship, which had sprung aleak; s and being unfit for further service, she was con- h demned.   on board of her came passenger an o Italian count by the name of Contelli.'   v "I knew him," said Don Garcia, emphatically. c "He died last night." "This count," continued Guido, after bowing e politely to Don Garcia, " was accompanied, said my   foster-brother, by a female of extraordinary I1 beauty, in whom he recognized the daughter of c an impoverished Spanish hidalgo of our province, Is whom I   well knew; and I also remember the w beauty of the daughter, whose only dowry was el her loveliness. This count entered into' an re agreement with the captain of the American pi schooner to charter her for some weeks, or per- ct   haps months; and paying largely, the captain re concluded the engagement. They came on board, and the vessel at once set sail for Vera at Cruz. My foster-brother did not at first make it himself known to the lady, whom he was not )- long in discovering, was the unwedded wife of i- the count, who was neglectful of her, and some- n times treated her with such rudeness that the o American officer interposed in her behalf; yet, i. with all this, she seemed to be attached to the d count with all her being. On reaching Vera y Cruz, the count went on shore; but after a few e hours, returned in ill humor, and gave orders for e the vessel to sail for New Orleans. At length a it transpired on board that he was in search of I, a lady, whom he had followed from Spain, and l whom   he believed was in Mexico; but now - ascertained was in New Orleans. The voyage - was prolonged by head winds, and it was three  weeks after leaving the coast of Mexico before they reached the Balize. The count, all this I while, was indifferent to the lady, and her mis- f fortunes and beauty kindled a passion in the J breast of the youthful officer, which, when the count discovered it, he was inclined to encourage. But the lady, while she seemed grateful for his sympathy, plainly showed him that she had no heart or thought for any one but him who seemed to be her only enemy.  At length the vessel reached the entrance to the Lake Pontchartrain, and drew near to the city by the rear, and an- chored within two leagues of the town. By means of the bayou, or canal, the count came to the city and took up his abode in hired apart- ments, for he had discovered that the lady of whom he was in quest was here. The Spanish female also came with him, refusing to be cast from him; and either from indifference, or a sense of justice, he permitted her to remain with him, though he made her hold the position rather of a slave than of a companion; yet her love was strong enough to bear all this; so that she could be near him.' "The wretch.!" exclaimed Don Garcia, with emphasis. "In the meanwhile the vessel remained in the lake, awaiting his orders and movements. But, continued my foster-brother, his suit with the lady did not prove so succ6ssful as he could wish, and after consuming some weeks in vain efforts to overcome'her repugnance to him, he resolved to carry her off bodily. For this pur- pose he obtained a house on the verge of the canal, which could be approached by boats from   the schooner. He then fixed a night for the at- tempt, intending to convey her to this dwelling, and embark with her in a boat in readiness, which in two hours would reach the schooner. But the attack, though made, was defeated, one of his men was killed, and he himself was wounded." "Yes, yes I I know well who the lady was," said Don Garcia. "Can it be possible that the lady was Dona Gertrude?" exclaimed Clifford. "Yes," answered Guido. "You know now the cause of the attack, and the name of the person. He was wounded, and with difficulty was enabled to reach the house where he had expected to take the captured maiden. There he grew hourly worse, and, added my foster- brother to me, he will die before midnight. I am here to select a place for the/burial, which in this hot climate will have to take place soon after sunrise, if he dies to-night. "The place having been selected, I accom- panied my foster-brother out of the cemetery, and at my request he led me to the house of the dying count. But as we were both unacquainted with the city, the streets of which in that quarter so much resemble each other, we o10st our way, and we went two miles wrong, and had to re- trace our steps, and then take a different street for half a mile, before we reached the canal. By this time it had become not only quite dark, but late, it being full nine o'clock by the time we gained the habitation which the count had hired. Upon entering we found that the tragedy of his days had closed forever. He was stretched upon his bed dead. Two sisters of charity were watching the corpse. In the room was the countess-' "Who?" asked both Don Garcia and Clifford, in the same breath. "The countess. I mean the devoted young Spanish girl who had followed him so faithfully through all. He had sent for a priest, who con- fessed and married her before his breath left the body; thus, though late, rewarding her love, and repairing, so far as he could do it, her wrong." "Then he had some courtesy in him at the last," murmured the old artilleryman, who had listened to this narrative with deep interest. "The countess, on being informed by my foster-brother who I was, received me with un- feigned delight, recognizing me both by name and person. She was still very handsome, and I should have known her at a glance, though   sorrow had saddened the splendor of her beauty, The fact that I had known her in her youth, and that we were from the same province, at once removed all restraint,and placed us upon the foot- ing of old friends at once. It was a relief to her to talk to me of the past; and I indulged her by listening. She gave me, gradually led to it by remarks of my own, the history of her romantic life. She sincerely mourned the death of the man who lay dead before her, and at times would give way to excessive grief. I took a deep in- terest in her situation; and as she was so lonely and desolate, I offered to attend to the burial, and escort her afterwards to the vessel, which awaited still her commands. She told me she should return to Havana in. the schooner, and thence take passage for Spain, and in a convent there pass the remainder of her days. It was long after midnight before it occurred to me that I was an intruder, and that she might wish to seek repose. But this was absolutely refused, and at length, by her urgent request, I threw myself upon the cushions in the boat, which my foster-brother had the charge of, and which lay beneath the projecting gallery of the house. Here I slept until day. I then accompanied the' widow to the cemetery, and pointed out the sepulchre; and went with her to purchase -a marble for the head. Upon it she had chiselled only the two initials of his name on either side of a simple cross; and beneath, the words " we MEET ABOVE!"We remained in the marble shop until this was done, and saw it despatched to the cemetery. We then returned to the house, where a hearse and a carriage was in waiting. I accompanied her to the burial, and after it was over, saw her back to the house, promising to return at' noon to escort her to herlvessel; for I had not only a desire to see her safely on board, but to see the vessel and the crew with whom she was to entrust herself. Now," added Guido, " you see where I have been, and why I was absent; and you see more, that there is at once offered to us a vessel in which we can set sail without delay in chase of Don Conrado. The schooner, too, being already on the lake, will be able to gain the open Gulf sooner than any craft can reach it by the course of the wind- ing of the river 1"      * "Bat will this countess consent, Guido?" de- manded Clifford, whose eyes lighted up on hear. ing this plan proposed. "Without question, She has confidence in me, and feels grateful-to me. She will nothesi,   tate to place her vessel under my control for this purpose, when I shall make her acquainted with what has happened. Already she knows your attachment for Dona Gertrude, for. I related to her that and mine, as we discoursed together during the long watches of the night. Her sympathies, tender by recent grief, and lively with present gratitude, will be at once awak. ened." "Then let us hasteq to embark," said Clifford. There was no delay in setting forth at once. Don Garcia, however, said he would remain and go in the sloop-of war; for it was not certain that the schooner could be obtained, or that she was large and heavy armed enough to cope with the buccaneer, should it fall in with her. But Guido assured him that the vessel was armed, and though small, victory did not always depend upon size and number of guns. It was at length decided that Don Garcia should go in the sloop-of-war, which was busily getting ready,   r and that they should go to the lake and take the d schooner. In half an hour after this decision, s Guido and Clifford were set down at the door of I the house on the canal. 'The latter was already r strong with the supernatural efforts he was r called upon,to make. Indeed he forgot himself 'in his anxiety for Gertrude. The countess, on being told by Guido the cir- cumstances which had transpired, expressed to Clifford, in a modest and frank manner, that greatly pleased him, her readiness to give up the schooner to his use. The vessel, she said, had been chartered for six months and paid for, for that period, by the Count Contelli. and was, therefore, still for two months to come, under her control, as his wife. Clifford thanked her with tearful gratitude, and the whole party in a quarter of an hour more were embarked in the boat, commanded by Guifo's foster-brother, who looked the very personification of happiness every time he cast his eyes upon the former.   CHAPTER XXIV. THBI PUBRSUIT. OLD FRIENDS.   CLEAR and bright was the day, and the water sparkled in the sun-beams, as the boat cleft its way down the canal between low green banks, and through a flat and diked region. Now they passed between almost impenetrable forest shores, now across meadows, and now traversed a section of salt marsh. At length, the spires and towers of the city receded and sunk be- low the horizon, and the broad expanse of the lake opened upon their view. They at length reached the embouchere of the canal, and were fairly upon the briny waters of the lake, on the bosom of which, half a mile from the beach, -as visible the schooner belonging to the American captain. It was a beautiful spectacle, reposing alone  upon the wide bosom  of the water, the only object visible. Her shape, the graceful height of the spars, the symmetry of her whole outline, struck the artistical eye of Guido with i pleasure. As the boat drew nearer, he beheld with still more satisfaction the muzzle of iour S large guns, and as he knew there must be four more on the starboard side, corresponding to them, he felt a consciousness of being able to a 6'   r combat on equal terms with the brigantine, B should they fall in with her. They soon were , alongside of the schooner, and Clifford had no v sooner seen the face of Frederick Benson, than t he recognized him as one .whom he had knowi I before; but the American was too much inter. 1 ested in receiving the countess, whose deep pas. * sion for whom the reader is already acquainted , with. When all were on board, and he had leisure to look at Guido and Clifford, both of whom were presented to him by the countess as her friends, he started with surprise at seeing the latter.      / '"Cliffordl Is it possible that this is Lieu. tenant Clifford?" ghe asked. "The same, my dear Fred." "I would scarcely have known you, you are so pale I  Welcome on board." "And how do I find you in commtnd of this schooner ", asked C lifford. "It is better than being on land," he answered. Here the countess laid her hand upon his arm and drew him aside, and told him in as few asfe   words as she could use, the object of the coming of the two gentlemen on board, and her wish that the schooner should at once make sail. in chase, in order to try and cut off the brigantine which Guido had explained was the vessel in which Dona Gertrude had been tarried off. When young Captain Benson thus ascertained that neither of the gentlemen were his rivals, his brow, which had clouded a little on seeing her come on board with them, cleared up, and he promised he would do any thing to oblige her. While hq was talking thus apart with her, Clifford explained to Guido how that Benson bad once been a reefer on board a United States frigate, and a favorite of his uncle, who com- manded her; but 'that he had been dismissed from the navy for fighting a duel; since which time he had never heard of him. He expressed, however, his satisfaction in having met him un- der the present circumstances, saying that he had the highest confidence in his courage and friendship: When Benson had received -his commands from the countess, he at once gave orders to weigh anchor and make sail. The crew, who had been laying idle so many weeks, received the order with a simultaneous shout. In half an hour the deck awnings were rolled up and stowed; two of the -three anchors aboard, the sails loosed, and everything ready to trip and away. The last order to "heave up" and "sheet home" being given, the schooner, fa- vored by a fair breeze, moved gracefully from her moorings and stretched across the lake in the direction of the harrow strait that gave egress to the open waters of the Gulf. The sun was just setting when the vessel cleared the Pass, and spread her canvass to the broad expanse of the sea. There was now a consultation held between Clifford, Guido and the captain, and the result was that they steered in a southwest direction, so as to fall in with the brigantine should she be making for the Mexi- can course at Vera Cruz. The next morning they encountered off the Balize a pilot boat, which informed them that the brigantine had passed out of the river some time before, and was probably a hundred miles to the south- ward. "This intelligence," said Guido, " is decisive. I know now where to find her." "At the temple, no doubt?" said Clifford, interrogatively. "Yes. It will be there that we shall first meet with them 1*   "And all this time for Gertrude to be in his power!" "We h've revenge left us, at least," answered Guido. All sail was now crowded on the schooner, jand at the rate of nine knots an hour, she took her way towards the soiuth, in full chase of the brigantine. The same evening the sloop of-war came out of the river with Don Garcia on board, and gaining the same information from old Roger, the pilot, respecting the brig which the schooner had, she also stretched away for the coast of Vera Cruz. We now return to Don Conrado and his fair captive. It was the second evening after leaving the Balize, that he descended into the cabin to see Dona Gertrude, having previously sent Father Clement to ask this favor, which, as it was so- licited with proper courtesy, and as she was de- sirous to come to -an' understanding with her captor, she granted. Donp Gertrude was seated upon an ottoman, pale, bu tfirm, and, if possible, looking more lovely tljan ever. Near her stood Father Clem- ent, dignified and commanding. A soft light shed its tempered brilliance over the scene. Don Conrado paused at the door to gaze upon herloveliness. He seemed awed by her com- posure, and the holy firmness of the priest. "Senora," he said, with as much gentleness as he could assume, " you will allow that 1 have treated vou with all the civility and attention you couJR demand; and that I have respected your privacy, and even now come rather as a suppliant than one who holds you in his power." Gertrude bowed; but Father Clement an- swered, " no after kindness or civility can com- pensate for the first outrage in tearing this' maiden from the presence of her father." "Sir priest, I wish no counsel nor reproaches. I sought this interview with the lady, not with her confessor. Senora," he added, drawing near and speaking in a low voice of tenderness, "I beg you will listen to me. For four years I have loved you with the most ardent passion. But it has been my misfortune to receive in re-. turn only your displeasure. Shall my love be thus punished? If you need proof of my devo- tion, you have it in my long remembrance of you, in my visit to you, ay, in thus having dared to obtain possession of your person. You have sent to me, through the priest, to know whither   I am' conveying you, and why I detain you a prisoner. It is I, lady, who am the prisoner. You have only to speak, to command me and my vessel; and at a word from your lips it shall reconvey you to your friends! Your destiny is in your own hands." "What is the destiny .  What is this word l" she asked, with a deep flush in her cheeks. "To become my bride! The word you. are to speak is a word of assent. Nay, do pot rise i Do not flash upon me with the lightning of your eye! You must be mine! Here is a priest who will unite our hands, and make me the happiest of -men!" "And me the most wretched of women I No, Don Conrado. You and I must always be sev. 1 ered in this world and the next. I can never w consent to be your wife!" "Then by the holy cross," cried de Beltran, a' in a voice of thunder, C" you shall be my mis- trcss I have offered you honorable marriage c Here stands a holy man to whom I am ready to n say that I will honor and protect you as your w lawful husband. Once more, will you  cept  my terms "-  "Never "            I i Then your fate is sealed!" he answered, and th turnin on his heel he left her. Five more days the brigantine held hercourse w across the waters of the Gulf. During all this n time Don Conrado had not approached his cap- nu tive, nor given her another word 'besides those I  with which he had taken leave of her. This my silence was suspense most painful.  Father the Clement was constantly with her. She had if  made up her mind to die, and by her own hand. From this he tried to dissuade her at first; even, her though reluctantly, recommending  that she lnt should consent to the hateful union.     C Never, never, never" was herfir response. dec He then spent his time alternately in prepar. the ing her for death, and in praying to Heaven to and send them  aid. On the evening of the fifth her day she was prepared to die. She had'found a his dagger which had belonged to Guido, and kept and it concealed constantly in the folds of her dress. Dol Father Clement trembled as he admired the fear self sacrificing heroism of the maiden. He no with longer dissuaded her from her purpose; b ut e hem had told her he would defend her from wrong used to the I  ist with his own arm. The perverse and aid; continued silence of de Beltran made them feel the v uneasy.   Gert rude w anted the susp ense termi- he w noted  . she had made up her mind to die, and :   ,u a she wished the trial of her resolution were passed, ner. so long as come it must, and could not, as she and believed, be averted. hall  At length the morning of the sixth day they y is passed Vera Cruz, four leagues to the left, and in the afternoon drew near to the land at the d ." point on which stood the ruins of the temple. The brigantine anchored within a quarter of a are mile of it. Through the cabin windows Ger- sei trude beheld the mlajestic river, lighted up by of the golden splendor of the evening sun. It was est a scene of glory and beauty, with the green en. the circling forests, and the azure waters laving the silvery. sands. At length when the brigantine qo, was anchored, and her sails furled, in the shel. av. tered cove that" almost concealed her from the rer open Gulf, Don Conrado descended into the cabin; but not until he had ordered his boats Ln, ialongside.  is- "Now, lady," he said, "I have reached my eI castle.   "You seeathe home of Belt, the bucca. to neer. It shall be yours to share with me. You ar will be the buccaneer's bride, and your realm pt shall be the sea-!" "Evil man l" said the priest, "canst thou mock thb misery of this young maiden  If t . d thou no fear of man or God!" "Bone, prating priest.

Thou hast mocked me long enough I e I will now humble thy haughty pride and have my revenge. Come to the deck and embark in rthe boat with me. Gently if thou wilt, forcibly I  if I  must l", Gertrude turned as pale as death. She placed her hand in her bosom, and nervously yet raeso. ultely caught the dagger by the hilt, as she saw Conrado approaching her to convey her to the deck, He laid his hand at once upon the arm that held the steel, as if he suspected her object, and was about to take her in his arms to bear her to the boat, when Father Clement, seizing his own cutlass, as it hung in its sheath, drewit and interposed it between him and Gertrude. Don Conrado released her, not so much through fear, as to punish him  Who had dared interfere with his power, and endeavored to repossess himself of the weapon. The priest, however, used it so well that he was compelled to call for aid; and it was only after four men had entered the cabin and pressed round the confessor, that 'he was disarmed. "Drag him to the tleek and mutw  him into the   boat; bat first put irons on his hands," said a Conrado.                 i He was obeyed. Gertrude, in the meanwhile, had been -seized again by him, and she found herself helpless and completely in his power and at his mercy. She could only offer up a prayer for protection, when she was borne to the boat. The men were ordered to pull towards the land, where they debarked at the foot of a ruined stair- case of stone, which led up to a tower. Ger- trude retained her senses, and was conducted by him to the tower, where an old gray-headed man with one eye, and a hand amputated, re- ceived them. From the manner in which Con- rado spoke to him, he had been left in charge of the premises. He led the way into a suite of superb apartments, the walls and ceilings of which were covered with the richest designs in carved work, intermingled with coloring. The floors were tessalated with the costhest stones; and the furniture was in keeping with the mag- nificence of this temple of the luxurious and tasteful Aztecs. "Welcome, proud lady, to the palace of the buccaneer of the Gulf," said- Conrado, as he placed her upon a sort of divan. "Here you ,may reign supreme. Where is the priest'?" he demanded of Tito. "He is in the court, senor capitano."  "Send him to the prison under the tower. Ah, senora, you need not start I and turn pale! You will see him no more I Were you to beg on your bendedknees to be wedded to me by the priest, I would laugh at you. Your pride has to be humbled I You are now completely in my powerl This power I shall use for my own pleasure, as you have had yours long enough." ("Snor de Beltran," suddenly cried Gertrude, gifted with the eloquence of despair, "O, if you have a human soul 1 if you know what mercy, what pity is, spare me I If you fear God, or hope for heaven, spare me!' I kneel -to you-I implore you have mercy-have pity ,pon me!" He stood coldly and haughtily smiling upon the graceful creature, as she knelt at his feet. He seemed to enjoy, nay, he did enjoy, her hu. miliation. He triumphed over her helplessness. A devil seemed to smile through his dark, hand-   some face. He bared his white teeth like a tiger gloating over his prey. It was nearly dark when the boat landed with them, and wax lights were now brought in by the white bearded old man. "Give us supper, Gordas. My bride and I will sup gorgeously. Let no luxury be spared. It is not every night a bridal night I Have the men brought the packages ashore?" t"Si, senor, they are all in the room!" "Very well. Senora, you will find a ward- robe-the same that was in the brig-awaiting you in the inner room. And that you may not say your comfort is not perfectly attended to, you have -an attendant. Is your grand-daughter here, Gordas?" "There she comes, senor." "Yes, you see your servant, lady! I hope you will thank me for this attention! You are not likely to be rivals in beauty." The person he alluded to was a hideous fe- male dwarf, with a hideous tusked mouth. She approached Gertrude, and in a hoarse masculine voice told her she would lead her to her room. Gertrude did not know whether to go or remain; but anything was preferable to the presence of her tyrant, and she followed the dwarf out of the room; but not before Don Conrado had whispered to the latter to search her at once, and take from her the dagger he believed she had. She was led into an apartment that realized in its superb arrangements of furniture and dra- pery the richest creation of the Arabian Nights. 3 But to Gertrude all seemed the desolation of a sepulchre; for she had resolved that it should be her tomb. The door had no sooner closed, than she quickly drew from her bosom the dag- , ger, when the quick eye of the dwarf detected i the motion, and snatched it from her. X   "Are you, also, my enemy .  Will you give r it me? O, woman, give it to me, if you have [ any pity!" "No, no i You are not to die this way! Why, i you are too young to die. Come, you must not think of anything but life. This is your bridal  night 1" Gertrude shrieked and fell almost senseless to - the floor.   CHAPTER XXV.  TIMELY RESCUE FOR GERTRUDE, AFTEB Don Conrado had seen his captive retire with the dwarf, he gave orders to two of his men to stand guard before the outer door of the tower, and for Tito by no means to leave the apartment, through which only Gertirude could- effect her escape. He then went out to give some orders to Lieutenant Randolpho, his mate, when one came towards him and said the priest earnestly begged to speak with him. Thinking he might have something of import- ance to communicate, he told the man who came for him to lead the way to the dungeon where he was confined. The place was beneath the foundations of the tower, and the way to it so dark that Conrado called for a torch. Upon reaching the cell, Fa- ther Clement said: "I have sent for thee to say a few words to thee in private. Wilt thou send the man away beyond ear-shot?" "Does thy speech concern me V" "Deeply," answered Father Clement. "Leave me till I call thee," said Conrado to the seaman. The man departed, leaving his captain and the. priest beneath the tower. The torch was stuck in a crevice in the wall by the side of the cell door, and cast its light broadly upon the face of de Beltran, bringing into relief his noble features, which were but the mask to a dark and evil soul. The cell was secured by a grated door, and within was Father Clement, in shadow. "Now say thy say," said Conrado. "A little nigher. Son, wouldst thou know before my death where to find buried treasure ." "Ay, would I " answered the pirate, eagerly. "Draw a little nearer. Art thou willing to go for it, though it be far, if I tell thee of dia. monds, and casks of silver, and boxes of dust of gold ." "By the mass, yes, to Norwege or Lapland! Thy words glitter like precious stones. Out with thy secret!" "It should not be overheard, for thy men also may lurk near. A  little nigher, that I may whisper in thy ear. Now wilt thou pledge thy honor to release the maiden in truth, if I unfold to thee this secret?" "Ay, rI'l swear it i" answered Conrado, readi- ly, though without the least intention of per. thhninj hisa' v    "Then hear me. There lies on the beach, near-- "I do not hear thy words, priest 1" "Put thy ear nigher I There 1 I have thee t" The pirate, in his avaricious eagerness, had placed his face so close to the iron grate that Father Clement, suddenly thrusting his hand through, caught him by the throat with a gripe of iron. We have already said that he was a man of large frame, cool and courageous. The hold he had fastened, though quick as lightning, was like rivets of steel. In vain Don Conrado, thus caught in the trap so skilfully set for him, struggled and attempted to get away. In his struggles he overthrew the torch, and both were left in the darkness to that fearful and mortal struggle. Vainly the buccaneer tried to articu- late; only a suffocating gurgle came from his throat. Vainly he tried to reach his foe through the bars, which were too narrow to admit his arm, save at the place (a little square opening to pass in food to the prisoner) out of which Father Clement thrust his arm, which filled it. Gradually the efforts of Don Conrado grew fainter, and the choking sound ceased to issue from his mouth, and soon Father Clement found that he supported his whole dead weight, and unable to sustain'it, 'he let go his grasp from the throat, and the heavy body fell like lead to the stone floor. "Heaven forgive me I But I have done it to save the maiden I She has no more to fear, at least from him 1" and he sunk exhausted upon a settle in his dungeon. All was now silence in the scenes so lately marked by a struggle for . life against death. How long Father Clement remained in a state. of half insensibility he knew not; but he was roused from  it by a sudden cannonading that-shook the very foundations of the tower..            I  The seaman whom   Conrado had dismissed,' on reaching the bourt found his messmates en- gaged around a cask of wine in drinking to the happiness of their captain and his bride. He joined them, and soon forgot that- he might be called upon to return to the dungeon to guide his captain out. The carousal continued for two hours or more, when a light was displayed at the peak of the brigantine.  "It4is a signal for the boats to go on board," said Lieutenant Randolpho; " and   there is another, which reads, ' a stranger in sight." HeIe at once called all his men together and sent them t  the beachj while he sought hM dOpftin    but not finding him, he commanded the old man to tell him that the boats had been signalled on board, and that a sail, which he could now make out with his glass, about two miles off, was in sight. "Tell him," said he, as he de- scended to the water side, "that we leave one of the boats for him, in case, if it should prove an enemy, he can come on board to help fight the ruvesse" When Randolpho gained thedeck of the brig antine, he could see distinctly a twomasted vessel in the offing, standing in under full sail. He at once called his men to quarters and made every preparation to defend the brig, should the visitor to that remote inlet prove an enemy. As the stranger drew nearer, he "saw, for there was a moon, that she was an armed schooner, and he could see lights arranged as if the men on board were at their quarters. He no sooner made this discovery, than he signalized for Don Conrado to dome on board. But as the bucca- neer chief was lying well-nigh dead on the floor of the dungeon, the signals were unheeded. "That fellow comes up boldly," said the liea-u. tenant, to his under officers; "he must mean to attack us 1" "Orelse he is ignorant of our metal," re- sponded the quarter-master, n er'him. "Are all the men at their quarters " he de- manded. "All, sir," was the response, fore and aft. "Then stand by to obey my orders." The men replied by blowing the lighted ends of the fuses, and adjusting the priming on the guns. "That is the brigantine, my friendls," said Guido, as the schloner came farther into the bay, and he was able to make out herspars. "And those signals are for boats to come on board. Some of their people are on shore 1" "Shall we run alongside and board her at once?'. asked Benson, who himself had the  helm of the schooner. "Do not hesitate," said Clifford, as he handled  his .cutlass with; impatience; for the seven days  which had passed since he left New Orleans had  greatly increased his vigor, and be was burning E for the fray. Guido was by his side also armed 1 ' She is coming aboard 1" shouted Randolpho.   "Ho the schooner l!"  Thereowas no reply, and the schooner kept I steadily on, straight towards the brigantine. ( "ire!" commfanded the lieutenant, in a voice r that was heard'with equal distinctness on board \ bo t*sWl            '    i   a  The broadside was so well aimed that the 1 schooner's foremast was shot away and fell its v whole'length over the larboard bow. But she ', was under such full headway that it did not check her in her course, and Benson succeeded in laying her broadside upon the starboard quar- i ter of the brigantine, while his guns, muzzle to t muzzle, poured into her a terrible and destruc- tive fire. At the moment the vessels came in contact, Clifford called out in a thrilling voice for boarders, and without waiting to see whether he was followed or, not, leaped upon the deck of the brig. Randolpho met him, cutlass in hand, but was cloven to the neck by a single blow, while Clifford, without pausing, pressed towards the quarter-deck, crying out, ' Conrado de Bel- tran, vengeance to the rescue!" If de Beltran had been on board, there is no question but that he would have bounded to meet the challenge. Guido, unrecognized in the confusion, fighting his way to the cabin, entered it; but found it deserted. Two or three ai'med men rushed down after him, but seeing who it was, they drew back in surprise. "Where's Don Conrado? Whereis the lady!" he demanded, so authoritatively, that they an- swered promptly: "On shore, senor, at the tower!" "If you would save your necks, side with me, for his day is past. The men, however, showed a disposition to fight, when-cutting his way through them, slaying two, he gained the deck. Here Clifford was fighting like a lion, every- ' where seeking his antagonist. Guido called aloud on the crew to lay down their-arm, saying they should be unharmed, and as the fight was going hard against them, the most of them obeyed, and those who continued to resist were cut to pieces by the crew of the schooner, which, headed by Benson, carried death from stem to stern. In ten minutes the brigantine was captured, and the crew disarmed and confined below. Clifford, who had been made acquainted by Guido with the fact that Don Conrado was on shore, was eager to reach the land, and with twenty men in two boats, they pulled to the tower. Clifford leaped to the shore, and only suffering Guido to precede him as a guide, knowing the place so well, he soon gained the court. It was deserted. The few of Don Con- rado's men who had remained, having compre- hended that the fight had resulted in the capture of the brigantine had fled on ihl udifii of the   boats. The old man was encountered near the outer door, with a torch in his hand. He did not seem to fear, as he quietly awaited them. Guido at once approached him and laid his hand on his shoulder. "Where is my uncle?" "Where is the lady?" demanded Clifford. "The lady is in there with my grand-daugh- ter! I know not where Don C(onrado may be!" "Follow me! I will show you the way!" cried Guido, entering the outer apartment. Here he beheld Tiro asleep on a rug. He awakened him; and his surprise was only equalled-by his fear, on beholding both Clifford and Guido standing armed over him. "Where is thy master ." "I know not, senors. He was to have been married to-night to the lady-" "Married i Then he has-" Clifford could utter no more for very hope-- for very fear! "Is he not married ." demanded Guido, more cool. "Not yet, senor. He has treated her like a lady on the voyage, and hardly spoken to her, hoping she would relent; but finding she would not, he was to marry her any how 1" "Then we are not too late 1" said Guido. "Two hours sooner and you would have been," answered Tito. "Now, senor, as I have been so frank, I hope you will treat me civilly." "That will be as you deserve." "Thank Heaven! I breathe again!' exclaimed Clifford, with a face radiant with joy. "Yes, all is not lost! This way! We shall doubtless find Don Conrado here-"  And they pressed forwards to the inner room; but as they did so the door was opened by the dwarf, for the noise of the battle on the water,  and the confusion in the tower, had all reached  the ears of Gertrude; and she instantly felt that ' there were friends coming to her aid. She and  the dwarf had heard the men as they fled away from the tower on Clifford's approach, say that t theirvessel had been captured; and who, thought ( Gertrude, should be its captors but those who i seek for me . But that Clifford shiould be near, t he whom she believed far away on an invalid's r couch, she did not once dream. When, there- . freo, the dwarf opened the door a little way, to E look out, who can imagine her surprise on dis-  covering first Guido, and then Clifford, advan-  cing towards the room. With one thrilling, u heart-swelling scream of joy, she sprang forward, a and w clasped to her lover's heart I!   What pen shall dare attempt to describe the 1 happiness of that moment of re-union I A few, brief, hurried, tearful words from her I lips, assured Clifford that she was now perfectly, perfectly happy. But her next thought was for Father Clement, to whom, she told her lover, under Heaven's providence, she owed herpres- - ervation. Guido demanded to know where the ' priest was, when the old man told him that he ' would lead him to him. "But where is my uncle ." ho asked. But no one could answer this question. At the door of the dungeon, however, the question found a response. They discovered him lying there senseless. It would be vain to try to express the surprise of Father Clement on being released by one who told him that he was the friend of Clifford, who was new holding the rescued Gertrude to his heart. Guido, being told by Father Clement the cause of Don Con- rado's present condition, bent over his uncle to ascertain if there was life in him. The priest with great anxiety sought the fallen mal's pulse. "He lives to see his discomfiture," said Guido. "He lives, and his blood is noton my hands,"' said Father Clement. Raising him up they bore him to the court, where he was brought to by the application of cold water to his face. When at length he was able to rise to his feet and to comprehend all that had passed, his confusion was indescribable. Guido took pains to Wform him of his defeat in the dearest object of his wicked purposes, and that he was a prisoner. Foaming at the mouth with rage, he endeavored to rush upon Guido; but being restrained, the chains which the priest wore were taken from his hands and placed on his own. He was then committed to the care of three of Benson's men, and placed in the dun- geon from which the priest had been liberated. Thus was justice meted out to him in the pre- cise shape in which he had exercised his injustice. The schooner having been so severely wound- ed in hull and spars, was the next morning set on fire and consumed; and B8enson, at G(uido's request, took the command of the brigantine, on board of which, the next day, de Beltran was removed in chains. Shortly afterwards, the happy Clifford came on board with the equally happy maiden and Guido; and there, in the preseince of the whole crew, and of Don Con, /' tado, chained, in full sight, Father Clement united the lovers in the holy ties of. wedlock  and thus the dark clouds of their youthful yearn were dissipated before a new and brighter day,   After the ceremony, at which the lovely widow of Count Contelli was not the least interested spectator, the brigantine set sail from the spot, though not until, by Guido's request, Captain Benson took possession of the treasures and costly articles that were found at this rendezvous. At Vera Cruz the stopped to deliver the famed Captain Belt up b/the authorities; and he was conveyed under guard away from the brigantine, silent and sullen, disdaining to speak, and lodged in the castle of Ulloa; whence a few days afterwards he was taken out and shot! and ever thus will end the career of unprincipled passion, which fears neither God, conscience, nor human law. As the brigantine was going out of the harbor, two American vessels of war entered; one of which was recognized by Clifford as the sloop commanded by his friend; and the other as the frigate which was his uncle, the commodore's flag-ship. The brigantine was, therefore, an- chored, and he went on board of the sloop to inform the captain of his success, and to thank him for his friendly alacrity in coming to his aid, and to send Don Garcia to the embraces of his daughter; and from thence, accompanied by the diffident Guido, whom he insisted should accompany him, he went on board the frigate. Here he was warmly received by his uncle, and embraced by his sister, to whom he no sooner presented Guido as his dearest friend, than he observed by the mantling cheek and light of joy sparkling in her eyes, that Guido had not over- estimated the impression he had made upon her. Why should we follow another thread of true love through all its details to its issue? Let the fair reader know that Clifford and his bride, Father Clement, and Guido, all left the brigan- tine to become the commodore's guests; and as he promised to take his nephew to oJew Orleans in the frigate, they all parted with real regret from the young American captain, whose cour- age, frankness and intelligence had commanded their esteem; while his deep passion for the countess had enlisted their sympathy for him Guido, on the voyage, was almost hourly in the company of the beautiful Mary Clifford; and   after the frigate reached the capital of the south, Father Clement officiated at the Casa Granda in a second bridal, and gave to Guido the hand of Mary Clifford, the beautiful and rich " belle of the sea," as she was termed by the numerous officers who envied-Guido his prize. The brigantine, under the command of Ben- son, put to sea before the frigate, and sailed for Havana, and thence to Spain; for the young American insisted if the countess was to go across the ocean, he would take her in his vessel. It was a perilous consenting, so far as her vows of taking the veil were concerned; for when the brigantine reached Cadiz, the young captain, smiling like a May morning, landed with flying colors, and led the countess to the first cathe- dral, where, instead of taking the vows of reli- gion, she breathed those of love, and became the bride of the gallant American captain, in- stead of bride of the church. Old Giberto has never left the service of Clifford. Tito has been hanged in Matanzas for being one of the cele. brated Captain Belt's men; and Don Garcia, pardoned by the captain-general, has been re- stored to his estates in the island, where he re- sides part of the year, with Clifford and Ger- trude his guests, and the balance of the yeasr with them at their elegant mansion in New Or- leans. Job Sorril is now captain of a Marble- head coaster, and getting rich on two hundred a year. Old Roger, with his young pilot, still boards inward bound vessels, but is shy of such as come in under shortened sail. Thus, having brought our tale to a happy conclusion, punishing vice and rewarding virtue, we take a courteous farewell of our readers, with many acknowledgements for their atten- tion, and the interest thk have manifested in the fortune and fate of our heroes and heroines. Though the " course of true love " seldom run- neth smooth, yet, like those brooks whose cur- rents are most obstructed by rocks and shoals, it generally becomes placid near its mouth, and flows calmly into the sea of life, retaining no trace of the obstacles which have caused it to fret and foam, and turn a thousand times out of its onward channel.
