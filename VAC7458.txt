THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.

channel. From the terrace of the castle one
could toss a. penny into the chimney-tops of twor
or three of the nearest cottages, though the t
dwellings were generally some distance apart,e
following the windings of a street around these
curving shore of the cove. There was an air ofs
neatness and thrift about most of the habita-
tions, each having a small garden patch and a
yard in front wherein to dry their nets and fish.
If there was any superiority in the appearances
of either of these cabins over the other, it was toI
be claimed by one which stood near the foot of
the cliff, and close to the path which wound
from the beach to its summit. This superiority
consisted in its being whitewashed, and in hav-
ing vines growing over the narrow doorway in
imitation of an arch, beneath which were two
wooden benches, from which, persons seated
upon them had a pleasant view of the channel
with its moving craft. .That spot, also, wherein
the other fishermen dried their nets, was by the
proprietor of this abode made a flower-garden,
while on the surrounding rocks were spread his
nets and sun-dried fish.
One evening in'May, in the year 1650, about
half'an hour before sunset, a fishing boat came
sailing into the cove from the channel, and
steered directly for the rude landing in front of
the cottage we have described. Its bow was
shattered, and it was evidently leaking freely,
and kept from sinking only by the extraordinary
exertions .of a young fisherman, who was its sole
occupant, and who was bailing out water con-
stantly as he approached the shore. At length
the smack touched the beach, and with an ex-
clamation of satisfaction the young man leaped
on shore.
The danger in which the boat had been was
apparent to more than one. in the village, and
encouraging shouts had been sent to the young
man's ear, to keep up his strength and not lose
his- courage. Therefore, on reaching the land in
safety, he found him~eItin the midst of some
score of a group, composed of the fishers' wives,
of maidens, and of such old men as had given
over active service. They looked at- the shat-
tered bow of the boat with surprise, and while-
some congratulated him with having got safely
to land, others eagerly inquired how he had got
so badly wrecked.                 .
"It is of no consequence, friends," answered
the young map, as he secured the boat to oso of
the posts of the pier, " accidents will happen at
sea, you know."
"

This was said with a pleasant laugh; but his
mother, who drew near to welcome -him after
the danger she conceived he had been in from
drowning-for he had been seen by her a league
at sea, struggling to save his boat, which he had
so gallantly brought in-knew that the smile
was forced and unnatural to his usually frank
and open face.
"There is something'in this," she said, shak-
ing her head and turning to two of her particu-
lar gossips, " there is something in this matter
more than Guilford sees fit to tell."
The young man, having secured the craft high
up on the beach and furled the sails, shouldered
a pair of oars, and with a flushed brow, and a
proud, defiant air, strode up towards the cottage,
without regarding his friends, whom he left ex-
amining the boat and wondering how it could
have been so shattered unless it had been run
into.
" That is it," asserted an old fisherman, who
had carefully examined the broken shearing
"she ha' been run into, an' by a heavier craft
than hersel'."
The young fisherman, having deposited his
oars in the becket above one of the cottage win-
dows, on the .outside of the house, instead of
going in, began to pace up and down in the lit-
tle shell-covered walk before it. His eyes were
restless and fiery, his attitude erect and warlike,
and his heavy step seemed to fall to the sound
of a trumpet. Something evidently had occurred
to rouse in the bosom of the young fisherman all
the pride, independence, and haughty resent-
ment of the man;' for beneath the fustian jacket
may beat as much pride and sense of honor as
beneath the ermine of a born noble.
The appearance of the young fisherman was
superior to that of young men of his class and
occupation. This superiority did not consist in
dress, for his clothing was as coarse and rude as
that of any of his fellows; nor in the symmetry
of his person, for there were in the hamlet as
well shaped young men as he ; but it was in the
noble expression of his whole form and face.
He looked like one born rather to command
those with whom he daily associated, than to be
merely their equal. This innate power in him
they recognized, though it was never demanded
by him, for he seemed wholly unconscious of a
superiority of which all others in the hamlet
were instinctively conscious. His face was
handsome, and perhaps'not less so for being
browned by the sea winds till it was almost as

dark as the Arabian. His eyes were black, and
filled with intelligence and courage. As a sea-
man he had no equal on the Sussex coast, of
his age, all men acknowledged. As a fisherman
he was skilled in the craft, in all its details, so
that no one ever surpassed him in success. If
other boats came back empty, Guilford Gra-
ham's was sure to contain some fruits of his
skill and patience. In trials of strength and
agility in those holiday sports which the youths
of the hamlet used to indulge in, challenging to
competition some inland village, he always
came off victor. For filial obedience in support-
ing a widowed mother, for manly protection of
his beautiful cousin, Anne Graham, for his fast
abiding as a friend, and his reverence for holy
things, Guilford was an example to all the
young men on the coast. His popular manners,
his constant cheerfulness and good nature, made
him a general favorite; and many a pretty
maiden sighed in her heart for the love of the
handsome Guilford.
"What aileth thee, my son ?" asked his moth-
er. " Something hath gone across thy temper,
and made thee vexed,--tell me what is'the mat-
ter with thee ?"
He stopped in his fierce walk, turned, and
taking both her hands in his, he pressed them
with. affectionate respect, and looking her in the

face, would have spoken; but some strong emo
tion rising, checked his utterance, and tears
filled his eyes and ran down his cheeks. He re-
leased her hands, dashed the glittering drops
from his face, and would have walked away,
when she gently held him.
"Nay, Guilford, you must come and sit down
in the porch and tell me what has happened.
Tears in my brave boy's eyes! Ah, something
heavy has pressed upon thy soul this day, to
force tears from thee I"
" Come and sit down, mother, and I will tell
thee," he said, after a moment's internal struggle.
" You are wise and discreet, and may be able to
advise me, But you will not despise me when
you shall know all my rash folly ?"
"You must first prove to me that you have
been rash or foolish, who were never known to
be so," said his mother, who, though humble in
station and poorly attired, seemed to be, as he
had said, a wise and discreet woman ; being a
person of that plain common sense, so much
oftener found in low conditions of life, than in
the more artificial circles of society; and to her
influence was owed, doubtless, his superiority,--
for it is the woman that forms the character of
the growing man, and her plastic hand leaves
its impression on every moral outline.

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.               15

" TIE young nobleman," resumed Guilford,
continuing his narrative to his mother, in the
green embowered porch of the cottage, "stood
for an instant regarding first one and then the
other of us without a word. He then strode up
and said haughtily:
"' What and who are you that are so familiar
as to hold converse with this lady, and with thy
cap on, fellow?' With these words he struck off
my cap to my feet, and one of his dogs taking it
up, carried it off, tearing it with his teeth.
"' Lord Wilmot, how can you be so rash!' ex-
claimed Lady Catharine, with a mingled ex-
pression of pain for me and anger against him.
* This is the young man, Guilford Graham.'
"' And who, pray, is Guilford Graham?' he
repeated, sarcastically. ,
"' Have you forgotten the name of the brave
youth who, at the risk of his own life, saved
mine?'
"' How should one remember every hind's
name ? So, young man, you are the clown that
risked your life and broke the jaw of the best
horse in my father's stud; for the horse came to
the castle with his jaw broken as with a sledge-
hammer, and we had to shoot him. You have
a hand like Samson. But you did the thing
well, though it cost a horse worth a thousand
guineas.
"'Brother, how can you speak of such a trifle,
when my life was at stake?'
"'Trne, but a discreet person should save one
and not destroy the other. There, fellow, are
four guineas! I dare swear thou hast not seen
so much gold together before, and that it would

take a year's fishing to give thee in hand the
same amount.'
" As he spoke, he threw the gold at my feet.
I did not notice it. I had felt insulted by his
manner as well as by his words, and by this act.
I did not deign to glance towards him; but I
looked in the face of Lady Catharine. Her eyes
were alight with just resentment. She felt that
I had been insulted, peasant as I was.'
"'Wilmot, why do you reward courage in
such a strange fashion ? One would fancy you
had found in this young'man a foe, rather than
one to whom you owe a debt of gratitude.'
"' Gratitude to one like him!' answered the
young Lord Vane, with a contemptuous glance
at the coarse apparel of Guilford. 'I have paid
him for his service in gold.. What fault can he
find ? By the rood ! it would seem, from the
familiar manner in which I found him holding
converse with you, Kate, that he presumed more
than becometh a hind. Fellow, get into thy
boat and begone ; and think not, because chance
hath made thee the mean instrument of saving
a high bornlady's life, that thou hast gage there-
from for speaking to her.'
"'He did but offer to collect shells for me,
brother,' said the Lady Catharine, reproachfully.
'I called to him. He is in no ways to blame.'
"' Then it is you who are to blame, to de-
scend to speak to a youth like this, who will
boast in the ale-houses among his fellows that
he hath held tryst with Lady Kate Vane.'
At these words, the eyes of the maiden flashed
fire, but instantly filling with tears, she said :
"'You are ungenerous, Rudolph.'

my. Instantly dame Graham, with that in-
stinctive sense of propriety and self-possession
which never forsook her, though she trembled in
her inmost soul at beholding the shadows of
these two men crossing her threshold, advanced
and said civilly :
" Enter, friends, and refresh yourselves. We
were just at supper. If you will take seats, you
shall cheerfully have whatever our poor larder
can furnish."
The soldiers sat down without ceremony, as if
they felt perfectly at home, and were accustomed
to the civility which they met with. One of them
was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with dark, an-
gular brows, sallow cheeks, and straight black"
hair for a beard, while that upon his head was
cropped short like that of a modern convict. He
was armed in a formidable manner, and was
altogether a formidable looking person-a sort
of cross between a puritan saint and a robber of
the Rhine. His comrade was shorter by the
head, girded full 'twenty inches more by the
waist, had a bald bullet head, and no beard. His
eyes were small and twinkling, and the corners
of his mouth, which naturally were inclined to
turn laughingly upwards, were drawn down in a
sanctimonious curve, that each moment required
his attention to keep so. The names of these
two worthies were respectively "Strait-gate "
and " Broad-way."   The first five minutes
Strait-gate occupied in saying a long grace, to,
which Broad-way responded an unctuous amen.
They then fell to work upon the fish and ashes
cakes before them; and having taken off the
edge of their appetite, they began to use their
eyes, now in scanning the room, then the face
and dress of dame Graham, and lastly, but more
lingeringly, the pretty countenance of Anne
Grey, who sat aloof in the window, trying to
withdraw as much from observation as she could.
" So, dame, thou seemest to subsist by the
travail of fishing ? Verily it is a gospel trade,
and thou shouldst thrive. This comely maiden
is thy daughter I do peradventure ?"
This was spoken by Strait-gate.
" My niece, your worship."
" Come hither, maid, and let me see if thou
art well favored," said Broad-way. " They do
say -that much eating of fish doth improve the
Complexion."
But Anne, as soon as she saw that she was
particularly noticed, tripped out of the cottage.
" Verily and yea, the maiden hath fled. She
hath no need to fear the soldiers of the Lora and

of Gideon. We war against kings, and not
against women."
"And how fares my Lord Cromwell, gentle-
men ?"
" Marry come up ! - How should - he but do
well, who is next to king David in power, and
Solomon in wisdom. Nevertheless, thou show-
est thy reverence for him, good dame, by asking.
Where is thy husband ?"
"Dead, this seven years, sirs."
1" Hast thou no man about ?" asked Broad-
way, cocking his half-shut eye at the oars and
sails that stood in the corner.
"I have a son; a young man of four-and-'
twenty."
"Where is he, dame ?"
" He has gone forth on some affairs of his
own."
" Very well; when he comes back we shall
doubtless see him,-for by your leave, we will
quarter with you a few days."
" Such poor comforts as my humble roof
affords are at your service," answered the dame,
thankful that there were but two of them, when
there might have been more.,
After the men had well eaten, and quaffed
strong waters from well filled flasks which they
carried at their belts, they walked forth, saying
they would ere long be back to stay for the
night. They had not been five minutes depart-
ed, when a man entered with the familiar air of
a village gossip. He was dressed in a patched
and, torn doublet,-hose down at the leg, a coarse
tunic, and slouched hat. Moreover, his fiery-
red nose showed that he was much given to ale-
house potations.
"Ah, dame, how be it all wi' ye ? How is the
pretty lass Anne? Whpte is master Guilford ?
Strange news come to, twn. Hope you haven't
heard it first. Stirring times these--stirring,
piping loot times ! Thank the Lord I was born
in these stirring times !'
With this the new comer rubbed his palms
together, and spoke with great volubility, like a
man over-earnest to be the first to turn the fasset
of a barrel of news.
"Why, what hath happened, Master Digby?"
asked the dame.
"Then you've not heard it? Qod; you'll
soon know it, for they'll be upon :you. Why, a

THE good dame then went to work to pre-
pare some drink of ale and French brandy, which
latter article the fishermen on the south coast,
from their nearness to France, had always cheap-
ly and in ample quantities in their households.
Having made the potation hot, and seasoned it
well with spices, she sent Anne with it to give
it to their concealed guest, while she herself re-
mnained to watch the entrance to the cottage
that no one might come in unobserved. Anne,
on entering the back apartment of the hut, care-
fully closed and bolted the door between, and
then drawing a rough table beneath the trap,
she got upon it and knocked lightly with the end
of a broom upon the ceiling above her head.
" Sir cavalier ?" she said, softly.
" What, maiden ?" asked the voice of the con-
cealed fugitive, speaking through a crevice in
the floor.
" Open, and take this warm negus which my
aunt hath prepared for thee. We know you
must suffer from thirst and fatigue, for we have
heard of the great y ardships the friends of Prince
Charles have gone through to keep frpm being
captured."
The trap was carefully lifted, and the arm of
the wanderer was thrust down for the flagon
which the maiden reached up to him. As he
took it he tapped her hand with his fingers, in
token of his gratitude, and said in a voice ha-
bitually subdued to the lowest undertone:
" Thanks and blessings upon thee and thy
good aunt, maiden. Heaven surely directed me

" At least till my cousin Guilford can think of
some other place ; and he will soon be in."
"And who is thy cousin Guilford ?"'
" The son of my aunt ; and though but a fish-
erman's son, and himself a fisherman, he is a
true friend to the prince, and lrays for his safe-
ty, as well as do I and my aunt."
" Thanks, thanks, maiden. This beverage
will revive me and make me forget my day's
fatigues."
" Quick, sir cavalier, shut the trap down. I
hear voices."
The stranger immediately closed the boards
and leaping t9 the floor from the table, the
maiden removed it against the wall, and unbolt-
ing the door returned to the front room. Voices
of men in loud talk were still heard outside.
" Didst give it to him ?" asked her aunt, in an
under tone..
" Yes, aunt, and he was so grateful, and so
civil spoken; and his hand, as he reached it
down, was as fair as a born lady's."
" Without doubt; these court cavaliers do

" Thou hast seen her, then ?"
"Yes, my lord,'' answered Guilford, blushing,

she was something consecrated to his most se-

share with no one.,

JunorG from the manner of the captain's
reception on board of his ship, Guilford enter-
tained the highest notions of his authority and
popularity. The scene which the long, warlike
decks presented to his eyes, lighted up by rows
of battle lanterns, was novel and stirring to the
blood. Three hundred men were arranged in
orderly ranks to welcome their returned chief,
and the red glare of the lanterns falling upon
their features, lent to their countenances and pic-
turesque costumes a romantic character that did
not fail to impress the lively imagination of
young Guilford. There were at least a dozen
officers also assembled on the 'quarter' deck,
some of them men with gray beards, others
young and ardent. They were each and all
handsomely attired in gold laced coats and rich
chapeaux with plumes. The whole appearance
of the ship, with its tiers of cannon, its crowds of
fighting men, armed with long pistolets and cut-
lasses, and its chivalrous looking group of off-
cers, who all seemed gentlemen born, struck
Guilford in the most favorable manner.
While he was casting his eyes about him, and
filling them with the new scenes thus suddenly
opened before him, the captain, who was plainly
dressed, and in travel worn costume, placed his
hand on his shoulder and said to his offers:

FISHERMAN.                            83
Guilford's heart was swelling. Hope was
dying in him at these last words of the captain.
He felt that he was mad longer to think of her.
He now saw more vividly than ever his rashness
and folly. He, the poor fisher, to cope with
knights, nobles and princes!I He felt like drop-
ping into the deep, deep sea, and putting an end
forever, thought he, to his wild hopes, his am-
bitious madness, his despair, and all the future
of misery which he now so plainly saw before
him on earth.

"Messieurs, to this young fisherman I owe my
life. I was hotly pursued to the coast by a
score of Cromwell's hounds, and this young man
shot down the leading trooper and got me safely
off in his boat. This is enough for me to say to
place him on the proper footing with you all."
At this, several of the officers advanced and
shook Guilford by the hand, and especially the
young men were enthusiastic is their congratula-
tions. Guilford's feelings may be guessed at,
but hardly described. His heart bounded with
joy, for he felt that through this fair reception
might be opened a way for his advancement.
The captain now descended, or rather walked
aft into his state-cabin, which was an elaborately
carved house, built over the stern of the after
twenty feet of the deck ; for like the ships of that
period, the stern rose very loftily, so that a per-
son standing upon the top of the poop, had his
head very nearly on a level with the mizzen top.
At the invitation of the captain, Guilford fol-
lowed him into the first apartment-for there
was a room within a room. Before the door of:
the farthest state-room stood a sentry.
"What, how is this ?" he asked of his first
lieutenant, seeing the soldier.
" My lord, here are the written reports of all
that has transpired since we landed you three

' What hast thou to answer for thyself, false
and traitorous noble ? Shall I not hang thee ?"
"For my sister's sake !" he gasped, as if he
had caught a faint ray of hope.
" Thy sister ! Ah, yes ; for her sake I would
. do much, for I owe to her tears and eloquence
with the stern, flinty Cromwell, my head. What
of her?"
"She is here ! Let her speak for me."
"By the rood, she may speak for thy life and
gain it ; but thou shalt lose thy right hand this
night, as surely as there is justice on earth."
"Mercy ! mercy-my lord!"
Ho there ! Lieutenant St. Clair ! Call the
men together to execution."
'0, you are not going to kill me!"
"If thy sister pleads not for thy life, it is not
worth a mavaredi to thee ; but thy right hand
shall be cut off. I have sworn it."
With a shriek, the craven noble fell down in a
swoon his full length upon the floor.
A voice from the inner cabin was now heard
in earnest implorations. Guilford, who had
already divined that Lady Catharine was the
female who had been captured, with the yacht,
now recognized the tones, and he darted impul-
sively towards the door; but the sentry present-
ed his cutlass, and held him back. He then ad-
vanced towards the earl, and said with much ex-
citement:
"It is the Lady Catharine Vane, my lord-it
is his sister."
"I will at once speak with her," he answered,
and approached the door, which he unlocked.--
The maiden stood before it, with- her toilette
considerably dishevelled, her rich hair freely
floating upon her shoulders, and her beauty in-
creased by the excitement of her feelings.
" Lady Catharine Vane, I am not your jailer,
but your debtor," said the earl, courteously.
"Why are we detained prisoners? What is
this I have overheard about the execution of my
brother ?" she asked, earnestly.
"Lord Rudolph is not to be executed if you
ask his life ; but he is nevertheless doomed to a
punishment that no mediation can save him
from. In me, lady, you behold Lord Villiers.
This name is enough to show you what Iowe to
your generous interposition, and what I owe to
your brother. Here let me thank you, both for,
my daughter arid for myself, for the life which
you were instrumental in saving from the block."
"Then spare my brother ! 0, he is already
dead !" she exclaimed, on discovering him upon

the cabin floor, about being raised up and re
vived by some attendants.
"Nay, it is only a swoon"
"0, spare his life, my noble lord I"
" I will do so, for your sake. And he shall
understand that to you alone he owes it."
At this moment, in looking around her, her
eyes fell on Guilford, who was standing near, re-
served and diffident, listening to what was said.
She no sooner beheld him, than she seemed to
forget everything else, everybody about her ; for,
running towards him, she caught him by both
hands, and exclaimed, with the artless delight of
a child, which amid strangers suddenly discovers
a familiar face:
" You here, Guilford!e Heaven be praised ?"
The earl, who saw the act, and observed the
expression of pure delight and frankness upon
her beautiful face, was not a little surprised ;
and when he saw this pleasure reflected from the
handsome features of the young fisherman, he
was not a little perplexed.
" Do not fear, Lady Kate, you are safe, and in
the hands of a noble gentleman," said Guilford,
encouragingly.
" I hope you are not here a prisoner t-that
youare not in any danger ?"
" Be assured, Lady Catharine," said the earl,
smiling, that there is not at this moment a more
honored person in this ship than this young
man, who, I am pleased to see, is also known
to you; to him I owe my life. He brought me
off to my ship inhis boat, and without his gal-
lant aid I should now no longer be alive."
" Thanks-thanksl I am so glad you have
been able to serve the earl. Ah, Guilford, my
brother has done him great wrong. But, my
lord, I beseech thee, forgive him."
"Plead for me, Catharine h" suddenly called
out the young noble, who had been brought to
his senses. "Plead for me."
" She has done so successfully, my lord," an-
swered the-earl, coldly. "She has gained thy
life for thee."
" But my hand ! You will not cut off my
hand?"
" Were an angel to descend from the blue
skies and ask me to spare thy hand, I would
not do it. It is need and ripe justice that thou
shouldst not go unpunished."
"My lord, mercy for my brother.".

maiden by the -hand, and leading her gently
into -the rear state-room, " do not pain me by

thirrgeon of the ship, with his instruments and
bandages, added to which was a seething hot
iron, for stopping the flow of the blood. The
crew stood around, seven and eight deep, their
bearded faces lighted up by the lanterns that
hung in the rigging. Farther aft were the offi-
cers, with their swords in their hands.
When Lord Rudolph gazed on this scene, so
well calculated to appal his nerves, he gave
utterance to an audible groan.
"Take him in hand, executioner," said the
earl, " and at the stroke of'the ship's bell, do your
duty. This man," added the earl, looking about
him, "is to undergo a just punishment. By his
information I was condemned to the scaffold;
but through the intercession of a noble maiden,
Cromwell was content with my hand. I have
decreed that this young lord shall share the pun-
ishment which his master inflicted upon me."
At this there was a general murmur of appro-
bation, and the interest deepened. Lord Rudolph,
being led up to the block, was told to take off
his coat. But not obeying, it was removed by
another, and his arm was then stretched out and
bound firmly, in spite of his struggles and shrieks,
to the block. The executioner's axe descended
upon the wrist, and while a thrilling shriek rent
their ears from the victim, the bleeding hand was
caught in the brazen basin. The chirurgeon in-
stantly proceeded to perform his duty, and to
staunch the blood, while the stern earl, turning
away from the spot, re-entered the state-room.
"That act of justice done, I am more content
to be branded as Red Hand, as men, catching
up Cromwell's epithet, have called me, far and
wide. But the protector shall feel that if one of
my hands is baptized in the blood of the scaffold,
the other hath power enough in its strong nerve
to shake his usurped throne !"
The earl walked up and down his cabin three
or four times, under much excitement, which the
recent occurrence had naturally awakened in
his bosom. He then looked around, as if he
were seeking some one.
What, ho ! where is young Graham ?" he
asked of the sentry, who stood by the half open
door which led into the inner apartment.
"He -passed in, my lord, urging that he must
speak with the lady, and as youhad left the door
open, I did not consider that she was to be re-
garded as a prisoner."
"'Very well; you are released from duty."
The man returned, and the earl advanced to
to the door, which was ajar, He opened it, and
3

was about to enter, when he arrested himself on
the threshold at what he beheld. Kneeling at
the feet of the weeping girl, was the young fish-
erman, his hand clasping that of the high-born
girl, and his face approaching hers, and expres.
sive 6f the tenderest and most respectful symy
pathy.
"It is over now, Lady rate ! Tears are now
of no avail! If it would have pleased thee, I
would gladly have taken his place, though thou
knowest I have little reason to love him. But
all who are related to thee are near to me, for
thy sake. Let us be content that his life was
spared, for it was the captain's certain purpose
to have hanged him, but for thee."
" I cannot blame-I cannot reproach. Ru'
dolph must feel the justice of his fate," she said,
with sudden resolution. " But how camest thou
on board this terrible vessel ?".
" I came to bring off the captain, who, being
on shore, was set upon and nearly slain by
Cromwell's troopers; and although I was on
my way, dearest Lady Kate, to the castle to see
thee, I turned aside for his safety, and came
hither, little expecting to find thee on board as
I have done."
" My brother, when he had taken me from

is one of Cromwell's agents. Do you know who

under tone.
"The Earl Villiers."
" Yes, but are you aware that this ship is that
of the far-famed Red Hand ?"
"Of Red Hand the buccaneer ?" exclaimed.
Guilford, starting to his feet with surprise.
"Earl Villiers and Red Hand, of whom I
have heard you name the bold exploits, are one
and the same person."
"Can this be possible? Are you in the power
of this terrible man ?"
"You mistake him. It is the common people,

THE interview with which the last chapter
closed having thus happily terminated, the earl,
after complimenting Guilford on his spirit, pro-
posed to him, if nothing better offered,, to take
service with him in his ship.
" We shall not always be wanderers over the
sea, my friend," he said ; " the prince will one
day gain his throne, and then we shall be at the
top. As for Lady Catharine's heart, you may
be sure that it is in the right place; and I have
a higher regard for you than before, since I find
you possess qualities to win the attachment of
so lovely a lady, who, in the.brightness of your
character, can discover no obscurity of birth.--
Now I have one favor to ask of you," added the
earl, " and that is, that you will take command of
the yacht and convey Lord Rudolph and his
fair sister safely back to Castle Vane. He will,
of course, be something of an invalid, and must
be tenderly cared for. The person who was
taken with him in the yacht, is a spy of Crom-
well's, and I shall take care of him here. If at
any time you wish to join my fortunes, you will
hear of me, if you will run over in your boat to
the French coast, and land on the island of Al-
derney, off Cape de la Hague. At that little
port there is an inn, painted red. The landlord
always knows my term  of absence when I am
away; and any line left there for me will be
faithfully given into my possession when I put
in there."
Guilford thanked the ,earl for his kindness, and
answered that he thought he should very soon
be compelled to take him at his word and seek
service with him.
Thou shalt be welcome, and although I can
do but little for thee under my present fortunes,
some day, when I rise, you will rise with me."
But, my noble earl, I fear," said Guilford,

sadly, " that I shall hardly ever rise so high as
to be able to offer the Lady Catharine a hand
that would not be despised br ier proud house."
" Courage, my brave youth. In these toppling

yours, and above all, with such a prize to win,
you have nothing to fear."
This conversation took place in the outer cab-
in. The officer of the deck now entered and re-
ported that the yacht was alongside, and her
crew on board, and all was ready for her depar-
ture.
" That is as it should be. Now, my young
friend, you must convey Lord Rudolph and the
maiden to Castle Vane. Go on lioard, and
Lady Catharine shall be escorted by me into the
yacht."
Guilford then took a grateful leave of the for-
midable Red Hand, in whose dread presence ho
could scarcely realize himself to have been, and
descended into the yacht. The moonlight shone
brightly upon its low deck, on which, stretched
upon a cot, he saw the prostrate form of Lord
Rudolph, looking ghastly pale in the face. He
advanced towards him, and said, kindly:
" I hope, my lord, you do not suffer a great
deal of pain-!"
"Pain ! I endure infernal torments. Who are
you ? I see, now. What do you want in my

"I am ordered by Lord Villiers to take charge
of it, and see you safely to Castle Vane, as he

In a frame of mind far from welcome, Lord
Rudolph lay upon his couch; for his pride strug-
gling with a fierce sentiment of hatred and cra-
yen fear, and mingling with some little degree
of remorse, kept up a fearful tempest of passion
in his inmost soul. Lady Catharine left him
on her message to Guilford, a prey to emotions
of perfect torture. However, by an effort
stronger than was his wont, he checked their
away, and awaited, coolly as he might, the an-
swer of Guilford.
" H: says he has no desire to report it," she
answered, after going to the helm where Guil-
ford stood, steering the vessel in towards the
foot of the cliff.
"1I shall take care to keep it myself," he mut-
tered, smiling, as if he heard her words with
evident satisfaction.
The yacht now drew nearer the land, and was
soon within the black shadow cast by the tall
cliff. A few minutes afterwards she came to
the stone pier, where the boats of the castle were
usually moored. Here Guilford' brought the
yacht skilfully to alongside the landing steps.--
The men obeyed his orders in furling the can-
vass and making her fast; and then taking the
cot up on which the young lord was lying, they
proceeded to bear him ashore, and convey him
up the steep path to the castle. Guilford gave
his whole attention to the comfort of the invalid,
taking care that thbe men moved steadily and
cautiously, while Lady Kate went on before.-
At length they reached the gate of the castle,
here, after delivering his charge to the warder,
to whom Lord Rudolph said he had been mere-
ly wounded in a duello, he left to return to his
own home. But he had not advanced ten steps
from the portcullis, ere he was detained by the
voice of Lady Kate, close at his side.
" Why, Guilford, you do not well to take your
leave so quickly, or rather no leave at all. You
have not given me time to thank you."
"I did but fear to irritate your brother more
if he Saw,me take leave of thee," he answered,
pressing to his lips the hand she placed in his.
" You are too guarded, Guilford. You know
not how proud I have been of you this day and
night past. I cannot return without expressing
my sense of your noble delicacy. I appreciate
and understand it all. From this time we know
each other, and you will not mistrust me ?"
"Mistrust thee, Lady Kate ?",
"Nay, that is not the word, exactly. But you
will not doubt my regard for you ?"

40

L

" I cannot ; you are too kind, when you know,
as I now do fully, how far beneath you I am."
" Love knows no rank. You are worthy of
me, or I should never have loved or cared for
you. How like you Red Hand ?"
"And that noble gentleman and right hearted
patriot was the famous sea king I have heard so
much of. How difficult it is for me to realize
that in the Earl Villiers I saw none other than
that celebrated captain."
"Do you not like him?"
"It seems to me I could diewfor him."
" So do all men who know him, my father
says; and he is not the least of his friends. But
how shall I forgive him his act of to-night ?"
" It was terrible retribution, Lady Kate, but
was it not deserved ?"
" I cannot deny it. My brother has deeply
wronged him; and perhaps it is just he himself
should endure something of the suffering he has
inflicted upon him. It was a mercy that he
spared his life. Now, my noble friend, since we
must part, tell me frankly where you are to go-
what course you have marked out for yourself,
so that one day you may come back and ask my
hand of my father; for, as thou bast said thou
must achieve somewhat to please him and give
thee honor. I will wait thy time, true to thee,
even to death, so that thou comest not in life to
claim me as thine."
This was spoken with all the truthfulness and
sweet confidence of a woman who loves with all
her heart.
"I have hardly formed a plan, dear Lady
Kate. I will, by to-morrow,. decide. But my
mind is so full of the Earl of the Red Hand, that
I shall probably decide by going to offer him my
services."
" That would please me, Guilford. He thinks
much of you. Though he is now but the head
of a small company, and commands but a single
ship under good King Charles the First, he was
lord high admiral, and ruled navies by his nod."
"I will follow his fortunes."
" Thou wilt not be led astray? The times
are ripening, my father says, for the throne to
have its own again. The land is weary of the
protectorate and its tyranny. Prince Charles
has been defeated, it is true, and is now a fugi-
tive, either in Scotland or England, at this mo-
ment ; but if he escape over sea, he will then be
the rallying point for armies of tens of thous-
ands."
" It was rumored yesterday," said Guilford,

" that the prince had been seen in Warwick in
the disguise of a pack-man, travelling south. It
was also reported that one who had known him
perfectly, saw the same pack-man in Berkshire,
south of Oxford, two days afterwards."
" We heard of this; and doubtless the reports
are true, and the prince is making his way to
the south of England, hoping to find a passage
across to France."
" Heaven grant that he may reach France in
safety, and foil all his foes," said Guilford, with
warmth. " But Cromwell is so vigilant, his
emissaries are so numerous, his spies so vigilant,
that every person who cannot give a satisfactory
account of himself, will be placed under arrest."
The lovers had now reached the point in the
path down the cliff where it became precipitous.

Here they stopped, and Lady Kate, taking
Guilford by the hand, looked him earnestly in
the eyes, and said:
" You are going to seek your fortune and win
a name. But remember, I do not ask either
from you; but they are your own voluntary
wish; and never forget that, if after all, you
should return unfortunate, and without the suc-
cess you hope for, you will be received by me
with the same affection with which I now part
from you."
The lovers now took leave of each other, and
Guilford hastened down the precipitous path
without trusting his eyes to look back and take
another look of theI fair form which he knew was
lingering to gaze after him.

GUILFORD found the door of the cottage ajar,
and pushing it softly, he entered the small,
plainly furnished front room. A lamp filled
with fish oil burned upon the table, with a huge
" thief"upon the wick. By its light he saw the
two troopers. Upon a small truckle bed in the
corner lay one of them, sleeping off the pota-
tions of negus with which he and his comrade
had been abundantly plied by the good dame,
who desired to get them in a state of quiescence
as soon as possible ; a result in which she had
admirably succeeded. Sleeping heavily, and
with a loud, sonorous breathing, the other
trooper sat by the table, his head among the
cups, and resting on his thickly gloved hand.-
His black beard lay out upon the board like a
mop, while the light shone upon his round, close-
ly shaven head, giving it the appearance of a
porcupine rolled up into a ball. By the side of
his head lay his pistolet, the grasp of his hand
holding it loosely in his sleep. The two men re-
minded Guilford of two wild beasts he had once
seen crouched and reposing in a cage.
Having surveyed the scene, he stepped across
the threshold and passed lightly into the room.
He stood for an instant looking at the sallow
face of Strait-gate, who lay on the bed, and
wondering that so wicked a countenance could

"Let them sleep ; I have no wish to disturb

the inner door of his mother's room. "I have

the soldier, though it was moonlight and not
broad day, and no one came within twenty
yards of him, save the horseman who was
drowned in attempting to swim his horse round
the promontory.
Upon hearing the door open, his mother looked
up from her needle, and seeing him, uttered an
exclamation of joy, and going towards him to
meet him, made at the same time a gesture of
silence and warning.'

Those men in the other room must have annoyed
you not a little."
" They did at first, but they soon drank them-
selves to insensibility. But where is Anne, that
she did not come in with you ?"
" She is at the gate with Robin."
"Yes. He loves her, and I wish she could re-
turn his attachment. She had best come in, now
you are at home ; but I sent her out, as the soldiers
got to be something rude of speech towards her."
" They had best keep their tongues under
civility," answered Guilford, "or I will show
thea that there are men in England besides
Cromwell's myrmidons."
" Hist, Guilford! They will hear you. As it
is,they do not suspect us of being opposed to the'
government. But listen to me; I have some-
thing of moment to communicate to thee ; and
for this I have been so anxious to have thee come
back."
"But first hear what will please you, my dear
mother. My interview with Lady Kate resulted
in her refusal to permit me to cease to think of
her, and it is decided that I am to seek my for-
tune in the world, and some bright day come
back to ask her hand."
" Ah, my boy, fortune is fickle. But the Lady
Catharine shows a truly noble nature."
"I have no doubt that I shall be able to win
some name that will make me less obscure, and
more worthy to ask her hand of her noble father.
Would she wed me to-morrow, I am too proud
to become her husband as I am-a poor young
fisherman. I will win rank and name, and lay
them at her feet., Because she loves me in my
humble state, shall I willingly consent that she
shall wed one so lowly ? Shall I thus reward
her generous love ?"
" Thou art noble in mind, my boy," said his
mother, " and deservest her."
"Mother, thou hast heard of Red Hand ?"
" Oi Red Hand, the noted sea warrior, whose
very name strikes such terror along the coast !
What of him, Guilford ?"
" Dost thou know his history ?"
-        "Nay, I do recollect that it is said he was one
of King Charles's nobles, and that, when he was
to have been executed, he placed his hand be-
neath the axe instead of his head, and with the
other wrenched the weapon from the headsman's
grasp, and with it cut his way to the water-side
ana escaped in a ship."

" I know Cromwell has a reward for his head,

"I know not what he is. Men say he is great-

castles and towns on the sea coast."

"Spoken with Red Hand?"
" Yes ; I have been on board his vessel, which
to-night was not two leagues from the land,

He is the Earl of Villiers, a true-hearted noble-
man, and friend of both the late king and Prince
Charles."
" Speak lower, for there are strange ears near
us."
" The two brutes are asleep, and I pray they
may not wake till morning. Yes, mother, Earl
Villiers is a true English gentleman. He com-
mands a ship because he cannot command a
fleet. His wars are made only against the
usurper. His ship is the only remnant of the
true British navy, and he the only British ad-
miral, as Charles, the wanderer prince, is the
only British king. But these things will not
always be so. In a few days I shall, if nothing
more favorable turns up, offer myself to this
admiral of the Red Hand, and win fame under
his flag."
" If this terrible captain be a true earl, who
only seeks the rights of his king, I do not say
aught against this, Guilford, save that I shall be
grieved to have thee leave my roof and my side.
But mothers cannot always hope to have their
boys with them; and I hope to see you yet dis-

" You will not be alone, mother. Anne will

"But what, my young friend ?" asked the
stranger, who seemed to hang on his words with
nervous eagerness.
" The difficulty is to get off from the coast
unseen. There are not only troops placed in
our houses, but they are posted as sentries along
the streets, and have the beach in full view for
miles. It would be almost impossible to get a.
boat off with any chance of success."
The stranger clasped his hands together with
an expression of anguish.
" So near liberty, and yet not to be able to
obtain it !"
" Does thy life pay the forfeit, sir, of thy cap-
ture ?" asked Guilford, whose heart was deeply
moved by his acute distress.
" Assuredly, my friend."
" And thou art a true friend of the prince ?"/
"He has none nearer."
"Then I will save thee if it be possible, by
aiding thee to reach the French shore. But the
prince, where is he ? Hast thou any tidings of
him since he was seen last in Scotland ?"
" He still wanders. Like me he seeks to find
shelter in France. Suppose I were the Prince
Charles himself, what couldst thou do for me, if
I told thee I was really in thy hands ?"
"I would save thee or perish !" answered
Guilford; "and I will do all I can for one who
loves him  and suffers for him. - Here it is not
safe for thee-to remain till morning."
" Young man," said the stranger, "if thou
safest me, the prince will not fail to reward
thee."
"I ask no reward, sir cavalier, save success.
I will ere long return to you. I will go and see
how I can best secure your safety."
With these words Guilford took leave .of his
guest, deeply interested in him, and opening the
trap door, dropped lightly to the floor.
" Mother, he is a cavalier, and friend of the
prince, and his life is forfeit if he be taken. He
brings no other news of Prince Charles than
that he is a wanderer like himself. Now I must
get him out from here, and to the sea-side. I
have resolved to try and get him across the
channel."
" You will risk your own life, my son."
"'Do not think of me, mother. I shall do
nothing rashly. Give me thy brown long gown
and shawl and hood."
" Here they are. What wouldst thou with
them ?"
" To handthem up to our guest to put on."

Guilford suited the action to the word, by
rolling the articles in a bundle and passing them
up to the fugitive.
"Put these on, and wait till I knock thrice
on the trap, and then come boldly down. Now,
mother," he added, as the trap door was once
more closed, and the ladder carefully removed,
" I want you to put on your other shawl and
hood and walk out with me."
" Whither ?"
"It matters not, dear mother, Do not ask
me questions that I perhaps can't answer but
if you will kindly do as I say, we may save the
young cavalier."
" I will be guided by you in everything, my
son," said she, putting on her shawl and hood.
" That is right, mother. These barbarians of
Cromwell's are still snoring. They sleep sound
as moles."
" I drugged their negus to make them sleep
and keep them quiet,' answered his mother.
" That accounts for it. It is the more favora-
ble to us. Now take my arm and come with
me."
The good dame placed her arm in his, and
crossing noiselessly the room where the troopers
were, they went out by the gate of the cottage.
Here they met with Robin and Anne, who hard-
ly realized how the night they had so lovingly
passed was wearing towards morning. They
both started consciously as they saw dame Gra-
ham and Guilford.
" You've come at last, Guilford," said Robin,
not knowing anything else to say.
"Yes; and I warrant me you were not over
weary waiting for me. I want you, Robin."
" Anne, you had best go softly in and remain
in the back room; if the troopers should wake
up, you can bolt the door.",
"Let Anne wait here by the gate, mother.-
You will not be away five minutes. Robin, go
to your boat; place secretly three days' provis-
ions in it, and put off as expeditiously as you
can, as if on a fishing cruise. Soon as you get
out half a mile, lower your sails and row back
in the direction of the beach rock; landing be-
yond it on the castle side. There you will find
me to take me on board. Do not delay, and be
discreet and cautious ; for the least imprudence
will create suspicion among the coast guard."
Robin signified his readiness to do as his
friend Guilford had directed, and immediately
left the cottage gate and walked towards his
own cabin, a quarter of a mile further east,

along the shore-curved street of the little port
He was stopped by two troopers, who, satisfying
themselves that he was a fisherman, and not a
prince in disguise, let him pass. At the door of
his own hut he found three of the guard seated
drinking ale, and eating rolls and dried fish.-
He adroitly got them into conversation upon the
comparative speed of boats and horses, and
drew them down to the cove, fifty paces off,
where his own smack lay, and got them to ex-
amining it, lie the while descanting upon its
speed. He then proposed to show them with
what rapidity he could row it, saying: " As it is
near day, it is time I should get ready to go out
to fish; but first I will show you her mettlT."
He then went in for his oars, and at the same
time filled a bag with fish and bread, and took
a beaker of fresh water with him. These he
placed in the boat before their eyes, trusting to
their absence of all suspicion that he had any
second purpose in view. At length, having got
all prepared, he loosed his boat and got to his
oars, and was about to row her out, when a
fourth, in the uniform of a sergeant, came up
and demanded what boat was putting off."
"A fisher's lad going off to cruise the day in
the channel catching fish," answered a trooper ;
"and lie has bet a hundred mackerel that his
boat, with two oars, can beat the best hunter in
England."
"le is a braggart," answered the sergeant.-
"But who has been in the boat and seen that
there is no Prince Charley hidden in the caddie.
By the beard of Cromwell, it would hide two
men!"
"No one has searched," answered one of the
troopers.
The boat was detained and the cuddle care-
fully examined, when, as nothing was discovered
like a refugee, and Robin being clearly the only
person on board, he was suffered to put off.-
His bungling rowing to and fro, however, as lie
knew it would be, was laughed at by the soldiers,
and having acknowledged that his craft was not
in trim, he hoisted sail, and told them that when
he hail caught the hundred mackerel, he would
not fail to pay his bet. He was soon rapidly
leaving the shore behind, and the 'forms of the
soldiers soon blended with the indistinct objects
on the land. When he had gained half a mile
from the beach, he lowered his two sails, and
taking to his oars, pulled towards the point
nearly a mile westerly, where Guilford had
promised to be found.

We now return to the young fisherman who
was so generously about to attempt to save his
guest from the power of the usurper. When
Robin took leave of him to go on the mission
we have seen him accomplish so successfully,
Guilford, with his mother leaning on his arm,
walked along the village street ia the direction
which led towards the castle. They soon cane
to two troopers, who-were standing in the street
acting as guards. The moonlight shone full
upon them, and in one of them Guilford recog-
nized the soldier who had before challenged
him. As the young man and his mother drew
near, one of the men stepped across the way
and presented his broad-sword.
' What, pray, is this, my fine couple ?" he
said, with a laugh.
"This is my mother ; and as for me, I told
you who I was some while ago," answered
Guilford, firmly.
" Yes, I recollect thee now.; but we must see
thy face. We must not let any nose pass us
under cover. A woman's hood, before now, has
hid a man's beard."
Dame Graham put back her hood and showed
him a dignified, but pale, matronly face, that
abashed his insolence.
"Pardon us, ma'am, but we have to be
strict."
"Can we pass on ?" asked Guilford.
" Whither ?"
" To the castle. There is a sick person with-
in one of the apartments who suffers, and your
orders are not so strict as to prevent passing to
and fro on the land ?"
"No; it is the sea we are to watch."
Guilford then went on a few steps, and when
beyond ear-shot, he whispered hurriedly to his
mother:
"Pretend that thou bast forgotten the lint,
and go back as for it; but instead of coming
back thyself, send the guest, telling him I wait
here, and that he must join me and take my
arm without a word. in your place. They will
not a second time lift the veil."
"I now understand all," said his mother.
"Sir soldier, my mother would return a mo-
ment to the house for something," he said, re-
turning where the two men stood. "Be quick,
dear mother, and I will remain talking with
these brave soldiers."
The good dame hastened towards her house,

fully.
" I think I recognize the voice," said the
stranger. " Hold ! Let me speak."

coming near he saw from their torn apparel and
haggard air that they were fugitives, They were
so impatient to quit the land, that the boat had

on board.
" Take us across to France, and we will repay
you well, for we have gold," they said, talking
like %nen who had life at stake.
The stranger, who still wore the female dress,
and who had purposely concealed himself behind
the sail, was now seen by them. They stared at
him, and then took their seats, as if too weary to
stand. They then looked earnestly at Robin
and Guilford.
" You are fishermen, then ?" said the eldest of
the two, inquiringly.
"Yes, sir."
"Will you take us over to Normandy ?"
'It is a dangerous trip, sirs, but as Iam going
over, you shall have passage."
" How fortunate. We will give you gold,"
" I am well paid, gentlemen."

surprise, and let him know that he had indeed
savedPrince Charles! This is a happy meeting
for us after all our sufferings together."
"Too much joy ! too much joy I That we
should find thee in the very boat in which we have
taken shelter. This day Cromwell's hatred has
foreverlost its victim."
Guilford had witnessed this revelation of the
prince to his partners in danger and flight with
amazement. He stood beholding him without
power to utter a word. A half formed idea that
all his hopes were now in the budding, and that
Lady Kate would yet be his, dancedbewilderingly
through his mind. Robin stood with open mouth,
in wonder and delight.
"Nay, my friends," said Prince Charles, "you
must not be shut out from being partakers of all
this joy. You have, you find, had your wish
gratified, and have' the prince' in your boat."
"And I will save thee or die, my prince !" ex-
olaimed Guilford, kneeling and kissing his hand.
"This is the happiest and proudest moment of my
life."
Robin also came forward and saluted the ex-
cited monarch, and all was joy and intense excite-
ment.
While the little vessel with its precious freight
was dancing on its way, Guilford directed Robin
to bring up the provisions from the cuddie, and
the prince and his two lords made a royal feast of
i% with such appetites as long fasting invariably
lends to both king and peasant.
The sun was an hour high when they had all
got through their morning's repast, and then
Guilford urged the prince to take some repose in
one of the, berths in the small cabin.
"This is well proposed, my young friend," he
said; " for I have had little sleep for the week
Past."
Leaving the helm in charge of Robin, Guil-
ford went into the cuddie and arranged as well
as. he could the cot of dried sea-weed for the
prince, and when he would have apologized for
its roughness, the latter said, cheerfully:
"9Do not say one word, my dear Guilford, for
I have learned to sleep as hard as the poorest of
my subjects. I am used to rough fare and rough
lodgings. But keep good watch, and do not let
..ny large vessel come too near us. Call me if
say war-Sbip is seen in any quarter."
Gui ford having seen Prince Charles lie down

to rest, returned to the deck. The faces of the
two exiles beanied upon him with grateful
smiles as he re-appeared.
" You are the happiest and most to be envied
Englishman that this day lives, yoang man,"
said Lord Algernon, smiling ; "for you have
under your charge the prince on whose safety
depends the fate of England."
" I am happier than I can express," answered
Guilford, resuming the helm, while he gave an
order to Robin to trim the sheets. " As we are
now full a third of the way across the' channel,
my lords," he added, " will you say what part
of the French coast the prince would like to be
landed upon ?"
" To the east of Cape de la Hague, and as
near the Cherbourg landing as may be," an-
swered the Scottish lord. " We have friends
there in waiting for many weeks."
"The wind is not exactly fair for making
Cherbourg," answered Guilford, looking at the
sails and then at the sky ; " but by tacking and
running west by north four or five miles, we can
then go about'and make it towards night."
" Is there no danger that we shall be interfered
with by the channel ships of war that are hover-
ing on the coast to watch. against the prince's
escape ?" asked the gray-bearded earl, with some
solicitude, as he cast his eyes about him and
saw four or five sail of vessels at various dis-
tances, some of them between them and the dis-
tant line of the coast of France, and one directly
astern, as if in chase.
" Are there ships cruising on the watch? my
lords ?" asked Guilford, changing color. "I
did not imagine danger save from the coast guard
on shore."
" There is great danger yet," answered both
noblemen. "An crder has been sent to all the
captains of the vessels of war to be vigilant in
bringing to and examining every boat that
crosses the channel."
" I did not know of this," answered Guilford.
He then stood up in the stern of the fishing
vessel, which being but five tons burthen, did not
elevate him but three or four feet above the level
of the sea, and with a keen, nautical eye scanned
carefully the, encircling horizon, commencing
F north and returning to the same point.
" What do you make out these vessels to be ?"
asked Lord Algernon Dudley, the old noble,
f trusting to the skill of the young saildr in mat-
ters of which he himself had little experience.
" The vessel astern, my lords, is a ship, that

has just come out of Portsmouth. I saw her an
hour ago, between the Isle of Wight and the
main, standing down. She is a Norwegian tra-
der by the shortness of her yards and square
make of her bows."
"You observe closely," said the young Scot-
tish lord.
" Yes ; We fishermen, passing our lives on the
channel, and accustomed to the sight of ves-
sels of all nations, soon discern the difference
between thdse of one country and another, and
are able to tell them a long ways off."
"Yes, I can understand it,"' said Lord-Cates-
by ; "for in the highlands the shepherds on the
hills oan often tell men of different clans at a
distance long before they can distinguish the
plaid of their tartans. What vessel is that to
the west ? It looks large, like an armed ship."
"It is a ship of war of large size," answered
Guilibrd; "but she is standing northward, and
is bound into Portsmouth. She will hardly
trouble ts."

" Then this vessel at the east, which seems to
be standing directly down to us ?"
" That I am more doubtful about. She is too
far off to. be well 'made out, and as her masts
range in line, I can't'tell whether she is a ship
or brig. But from the squareness of her yards
and the way she settles in the water, I am afraid
she is an armed cruiser."
At these words the two nobles looked'verv
naturally anxious, and watched her with close
attention. There were two other vessels visible
in the far south-western board, but at too remote
a distance to be made anything of, save that
Guilford was positive +hey were large, three
masted vessels.
The wind was blowing a five knot breeze,
from W. S. W., and the little vessel, kept close-
hauled, went steadily on her way, steering as
near as possible for the Cape of the Hague, now
about forty miles distant, in a south by west di-
rection.

LEAVING the little fishing smack, Which held
the destinies of England, to dance along over
the waves of the channel on its way to the coast
of Normandy, we will follow the adventures of
another one of the characters of our story.
When Red Hand the earl had regained his-
own ship, and, after the severe execution of the
sentence upon Lord Rudolph, had dismissed the
yacht, he gave orders to his lieutenant in com-
mand to steer westward until sunrise, and then
call him.
" I have not had one hour's sleep since I left
London," he added to the officer, "and I must
have a little rest."
le then went to his state-room, where he found
Edward, the youthful and handsome officer al-
ready introduced to the reader, engaged in copy-
ing papers. Upon the entrance of the earl, the
youth looked up and fixed upon the earl his
large dark eye, which had as much light in it as
a woman's, and said :
" My lord, I know not how to contain my joy
at your sai return once more tothe ship, know-,
ing, as I alone did, the perilous errand on which
yon  went-"
"I had a narrow cape of it more than once,
EdwM'd," answered the Wr, throwing himself
Sed a cushioned ettee.
" Autt what sccesa, My lord l" asked the

" Yes, my lord ; I will first copy these tWo re-
mainitig lines of the letter you have written to
the Duke of Orleans, to be loft at Cherbourg."
The youthful secretary then busied himself a
minute till he had completed the task allotted to
him, and then placing his pen by his side on the
polished Bragiban table, placed himself in an
attitude of listening. This young man, whose
beauty; as we have said, was almost feminine,
was about twenty years of age, slight in figure,
but tall, and gracefully made. A brown mous-
tache was just beginning to darken his well cut
upper lip, and his rich and shining brown locks
curled short about his circular and snow-white
neck. His brows were also brown or hazel col-
ored, like his hair, and exquisitely arched over a
pair of large, well expanded eyes of the clearest
gray. His nose was Persian, straight, and with
thin nostrils-always marks of high birth.-
When he spoke, rows of even teeth, as dewy and
translucent as pearls, were visible. His hands
were, as symmetrical as nature could have
moula d them, and his whole air and tone were
striking and distinguished. There was an ex-
pression of sadness upon his face that seemed to
be abiding, and to derive itself from a source
deeply hidden in the heart. With all his beauty,
there was a total absence of consciousness of it,
and with all his womanly elegance there was no
tack of the proud and manly bearing of his ex.
Between him and the earl there appeared to 'u-
l t a friendship equal and confidential, alnd
which seemed to take no daunt of the diffetase
in their years. The attire of the young secretary
was a suit of black vbvet, with here and there
plain gold button, and a silver hilted sword.

The Earl Villiers then took a pen in his left

placed a seal that he took from his sword hilt,
upon some wax that Edward had previously
placed for the reception of it. It was a shield,
on which was a. three-masted ship, and for a
crest was a hand severed at the wrist.

AnrTnU, EARL OF VILLIERS."'
This letter having been duly penned by the
youthful secretary, Red Hand settled himself
upon his couch and gave himself up to the pro-
posed sleep which he so much needed, while Ed-
ward continued at the escritoire writing and
sealing pacquets addressed to various exiled
noblemen in France.
At length the day broke, and the earl, rising,
went to the deck. His keen eye surveyed the
horizon. Three or four vessels were-in sight,
one of which, far to the eastward, was made out
to be a brig-of-war, but as she showed no colors,
her nature could not be made out; though as she
was near the French coast, she was supposed to
be a vessel of that nation. Some dozen fishing
vessels were also seen running about. Upon all
three Red Hand directed the long, heavy tele-
scope of that day, and then, having swept the
French coast near which he was'sailing, he sud-
denly gave orders to put about; for up to that
time, since Guilferd had left her in the yacht
during the preceding night, she had been steering
nearly west. The island of Alderney lay about
two leagues distant abeam, when they tacked
ship-
"Lay her coarse E. N. East," said Red Hand.

CHAPTER XVIII.
AN EXCITING SCENE.

IT was about three o'clock in the afternoon,
when the ship commanded by Red Hand came
nearly opposite Cape La Hague, the land lying
about five miles from her to the south, on the
starboard beam. The wind had been light and
baffling all day, and she had made but little
progress since the morning, not having placed
more than fifteen miles between her and. the
place where, at sunrise, she had put about to
steer eastward up the channel.
The vessels which had been visible from her
deck in the morning had now all disappeared in
their several directions, but others were in sight.
The brig-of-war, which they had supposed to be
a French vessel, had suffered the " Prince
Charles " to come near enough for her to make
out her character, when, without waiting for a
more intimate acquaintance, and trusting to her
heels, she hoisted the British flag, and ran for
Portsmouth. Several fishing vessels, but chiefly
Norman, had been brought to in the course of
the fifteen miles run, but there was no one on
board save the ordinary crews. Nor from two
English fishing smacks which Red Hand brought
to, could he learn anything of any fugitives hav-
ing been seen on the coast, or having crossed to
-France.
About half past three in the afternoon, as the
earl was about to give orders to alter the course
of his ship and run into Cherbourg, the lookout
aloft called lustily from his perch:
"Sail hol"
" here away?" demanded the officer of the
deck, making use of the same nautical phrase-
ology, which, for more than two hundred years,
has bein customary in the English navy

" Three points abaft the larboard beam."
The earl glanced over the quarter, and saw a
vessel, at some distance yet, but the appearance
of which caused him to call quickly for his tele-
scope. When it was handed to him, he rested it
upon a rattling of the mizzen rigging and lev-
eied it upon the stranger. There were a dozen
other vessels in sight in various directions, but
they were all made out to be either traders or
coasters and fishermen, save one, which was to
the north and east, whioh could not be made out,
being too remote, but which seemed to be coming
down hand over hand, bringing a fine topsail
breeze along with her.
" What do you make her out, my lord ?" aske
Edward, who stood near the earl, assisting i:
one arm in keeping the glass steady.
" A confounded large ship, and with iron
teeth enough to eat two such mouthfuls as we
are."
" A ship of the largest class, my lord ?"
" Yes, and one of Ci'omwell's bull-dogs. I
know her well, by her stump topmasts. It is
the Leviathan, and is twice our metal. She has
a breeze with her, too, and seems to he st-riag
dead for us."
" You may be sure, my lord, she knows who
we are."
" Without doubt. We have boarded craft
enough since morning to report us in that
quarter."
"My lord," said the quartermaster, wl o had
been for some minutes inspecting the ship in the
northern board."

" Keep up heart, my royal master! A few

The warlike, castellated ship now got within
her length of the smaclk, 'when the earl sprang
into a boat alongside, and pulled by a dozen
strong arms, the next moment had the prince's
hand in his, and cew him from the foundering
fishing vessel into his own barge. Instantly lie
dropped on his knee before him, and with tears
in his eyes kissed his hands.
" 0, my prince ! my escaped, my beloved and

rent with huzzas for Prince Charles, and for a
few moments it seemed as if every man in the
boats and on the ship were beside themselves.-
Some shouted, some wept, some huzzaed, some
danced over the decks, others embraced, and all
was joy and glad uproar.

Escorted by the earl, Prince Charles ascended
the side of the ship, and then every officer
pressed around him, knelt before him, and em-
braced him, weeping like children. Charles
himself could scarcely see for the emotions that
blinded his own eyes with tears. He recognized
this one and that one, and called them by name,
and kissed on the check some of those whom he
had once known most intimately.
" Now, your highness;" said Red Hand, whose
war-worn cheeks were wet with tears of delight,
"let me lead thee to my cabin."
" Nay, not till I have presented to thee and all
my friends the brave young man to whom I owe
my escape from England. Where is he ?"
The prince then looked around for Guilford
and also for Robin, but was told they were in
the smack, which some of the sailors were aiding
them in saving from sinking. He then called to
him to leave the boat and come on board.

CHAPTER XIX.

A NEW DANGER--RED HAND's DEVOTION.

WiEN Guilford, in obedience to the command
of the prince, came over the ship's side, and the
eyes of the Earl Red Hand fell upon him, the
latter exclaimed with surprise and pleasure:
- " What ! dost thou owe thy secure flight from
the shores of Britain to this young man, your
majesty ?"
"Yes; and never will I forget my obligations
to him. Advance, master Guilford, and let me
present thee as my deliverer to these my noble
friends."
" By the rood, sir Guilford !" said the earl, as
he warmly grasped his hand, " thou art in luck.
Thy star is in the ascendant. Thou art the most
fortunate man born ! Come, thou shalt tell
me how it has been thy fortune to be of such
service to England's king."
"My lord," said Edward, who had already
exchanged a grasp of the hand with Guilford,
" the men in the boats wish to know if they shall
save the poor devils who are swimming about
the ship ?"
" What," exclaimed the prince, " the wretches
thrown into the water by the explosion of the
frigate ?"
" Yes, your highness," answered Red Hand.
a By all means ! pick them up to a man, and
be diligent ! They are all my British subjects.
You have room for them, my good Villiers ?"
" Yes, your majesty, as prisoners," answered
Red Hand, with a slight cloud upon his brow.
"But I have little favor towards the villains who
have placed my prince's life in jeopardy."

"Let that pass ! We must be humane, my
dear earl. But what ship have we standing
down so bravely this way ?"
" That is a parliament war vessel, your majes-
ty," answered Red Hand, who had been so much'
occupied with the rescue and reception of the
prince as to be heedless of the approach of this
vessel, until now she was within a league, and
booming down upon them under all her enor-
mous spread of canvass.
Red Hand, having escorted the prince to his
cabin, and ordered refreshments at once to be
placed before him and the two noblemen, has-
tened from his presence, and ascending the
highest part of the stern, called Edward to his
side.
"Place the telescope in rest here, and let me
have a sight at this monster, for I begin to fear,
that the prince, now that he is on board of us,
would be safer any where else."
" There is great danger, my lord," answered
Edward. "She is certainly coming on us fast
since we stopped to take the prince on board."
" Yes, that she is, and she is already train-'
ing her guns upon us. Make all sail !" he shout-
ed, like the tones of a battle trumpet. " Every
man to his post ! Boats, aboard ! If there are
any more men to be picked up, let the ship
astern look after them. Cast overboard a dozen
spars for the miserable wretches to float on !
Sail all! We must save the prince from cap-
ture !"
At the sound of his ringing commands all

was activity from stem to stern. The boats
were hoisted up, apd Robin had theregret to see
his smack, to which no repairs could be made,
drop astern, and at length slowly disappear be-
neath the tide.
But all that the good ship could do, she could
not make her way beyond reach of the Levia-
than's long guns, one of which was now fired
upon her at the farthest range.' The shot fell
astern a quarter of a mile; but the second shot,
which soon followed, dropped into the ship's
wake.
" The game is up," said the earl. " It will not
do for the prince to stay half an hour longer on
board, for that ship will blow me out of the wa-
ter, unless I can work to windward, and then it
is doubtful if we can get away from her."
This was spoken to a group of officers whom
he had called around him on the deck, while the
prince was regaling himself with the wines and
acceptable fare he had placed before him.
" We are caught in this bay of Havre de
Grace, and must either run ashore or fight."
"It would be madness, my lord, to fight such
a ship, twice our size," said his officers.
"I know it. My mind is made up. We must
let the prince go. There is the little village of
Feschamps under our lee, not five miles distant.
And there flies a French fisherman straight into
the port. Fire a gun forward, and bring the
boat to."
The order was no sooner given than obeyed,
and a small fly-sail boat with one mast, which
was darting over the water, landward, like a
swallow on the wing, suddenly lowering its tri-
angular sail, waited- the approach of the ship.--
In the meanwhile, the earl entered the cabin
where the prince was at his repast with his two
friends.
'"This is a feast, my dear earl, fit to set be-
fore a king," said the prince, laughing. "Ihave
not dined so well in many a day. By the rood !
if you keep us so well here in your castle of the
sea, we shall be induced to be long your guest."
"Gladly would I have your majesty my guest
as long as it may please you to honor my poor
vessel with your royal presence. But I regret
to say that I have, come, your majesty, to warn
you that you are not safe even here, though you
are surrounded with brave hearts and'loyal; but
these may bleed for you, but they cannot protect
you against the foe that menaces your safety."
" What now? Have I to fly again so' soon,
my dear earl?' said the prince, with a slight

shade of discontent on his brow. "I was in,
dulging the hope that for a day or two I should
find here repose and quiet."
"So I hoped, your highness. Please cast your
eyes out of the -stern window, and you will see
one of the largest of Cromwell's ships in chase
of us. Itwill be impossible for me to cope with
so formidable an antagonist ; and I have come
to beg your majesty to take refuge on board a
French fishing vessel now alongside."
"I am in your hands, my dear earl and my
lords," answered the prince, rising. "But to
whom am I to entrust myself?"
" Two Frenchmen,-an old man and a boy,
your highness."                      , A
"I will take with me my two trusty English
friends, Graham and Robin; with themI shall
feel secure."
Upon reaching the gangway, the prince asked
Guilford if he would still accompany him and
see him safely on French ground.
Our young hero very joyfully complied with
the prince's wish, and at the same time with the
prince, the two lords who had come with him,
got into the fishing boat. Edward also made
one of the party, laden with the pacquets with
which the earl had entrusted him.
"Now farewell, my brave earl, and my lords
and gentlemen. I hope, if any of you, come to
Paris, you will not fail to call on me; and I
trust Heaven will one day send us all better for-
tunes."
. With this courteous parting speech, the prince
raised and waved his chapeau to the officers and
also to the men, who crowded the rigging and
bulwarks to see him depart. The earl lingered
on board the French boat last of all, and having
embraced the prince, he extended his hand to
Guilford.
" I see you need no aid from me, my brave
young friend. If the prince comes to his own,
you will go up with him,-that I can prophesy
without being a prophet."
The fishing boat was now cast off from the
side of the ship, and Guilford, by the command
of Prince Charles, took the helm from the old
Norman fisherman, who all the while had re'
garded with a sort of bewilderment this sum-
mary disposition, of his little vessel.
" Where will you land,, my prince " asked
Guilford, as he took the helm.
" What-village is that in the bottom of the
bay south of us1?"

TiHE PRINCE'S STAR IN THE ASCENDANT.

TuE earl and his officers were hospitably en- ti
tertained that night by the citizens of Cherbourg, i
vho, when they learned that Prince Charles had tI
safely landed in France, illuminated their city n
with joy; for the French of all, classes had a t
great horror of Cromwell, and although they
knew little of Prince Charles, the fact that lie n
was the legitimate heir to the British throne, was p
enough to bind to him the sympathy of the loyal, b
and, in that da , king loving people.s
The next day the earl, ivhose renown made U
him no inconsiderable mark of curiosity, quittedc
Cherbourg for St. Lo, where his daughter, the I
-fair Lady Jane, was placed for security and ed- I
cation. He was accompanied by several of his
officers, who, from thence were to accompany
liim to Paris, where they hoped to meet the
prince, of whose safe landing at Feschamps thel
earl had heard through Edward, who had joined
him at Cherbourg.
"And what became of my brave friend Guil-
ford ?" asked the earl.
" He accompanied the prince. by his request, to
Paris. I saw them depart, with the youth, and
Robin, mounted on horses furnished by the
mayor of Feschamps. Lords Algernon and
Catesby also accompanied his majesty ; and
they hoped to reach Paris in eighteen hours."
At St. Lo the earl received his daughter, who
joined the cavalcade, and riding more especially
under the care of the youthful secretary, she was
escorted to the metropolis.
The subsequent events connected with the ar-
rival of the prince in France, and his retiring
and establishing a court inlHolland of the nobles
who had followed him, are such common mat-

ers of history, that we need not dwell upon them
;n our story, but carry our narrative forward to
lhe period when the sun of his fortunes onco
more rose above the horizon and lighted him to
lhe throne of his ancestors.
Cromwell, after an unparalleled usurpation of
nine years, at length died, contrary to the ex-
ectation of his enemies, peacefully upon his
bed, and naming his son Richard as his succes-
or. But this erson possessed none of the am-
bition or statesmanlike talents, or warlike spirit
of his father, and after a brief exercise of the
power bequeathed to him, resigned it into the
hands of a parliament. England was now with-
out a head ; and all hearts were turned to the
youthful Prince Charles, who still remained in
Holland, where he surrounded himself by a bril-
liant court. To him a messenger was despatched
by the Parliament, offering to reinstate him on
the throne of the realm on certain conditions.
The prince, when the parliament's courier was
announced, was dining at a table, at which were
seated a score of his nobles, among whom were
lord Algernon, the Scottish lord Catesby, and
last, not least, Arthur of the Red Hand, Earl of
Villiers.
When the prince received the pacquet from
the hand of Lord Rudolph, who was the messen-
ger, his brow darkened as he perused it, the ex-
pression of his face being all the while closely
watched by his friends, who forgot the banquet
in their anxiety to learn the news from England.
But when he came to the close of it, a smile
curled his lip.
"News from London, my lords! You will
excuse me while I withdraw to give a response.

He also named four other noblemen, and then
rising, he took his leave and departed from the
banquet room. Upon reaching his cabinet he
closed the door, but first gave orders to have
"Lord Rudolph Vane, the courier, hospitably en-
tertained with all honor.
"See to it, Guilford !" he paid., turning to our
hero, who had left the table with him at his com-
mand, and now followed him into the cabinet.
" Your majesty could perhaps hardly appoint
a less acceptable host to Lord Rudolph," an-
swered Guilford, with a slight color of embarrass-
ment.
" True-true! I had forgotten ! My Lord
Granville," added the prince, I pray you take
care of Lord Vane's comfort. We must not
treat discourteously our Parliament's messen-
ger")
" I obey, your majesty," answered the noble-
man, retiring.
"Now, my lords," said the king, " hear our
words. The brave and loyal General Monk, who
seems to be standing just now in Cromwell's
shoes in England, writes me that now Richard
the son has resigned his power, he is ready to
offer me my father's throne, provided that I will
submit to and put my signature to certain con-
ditions-the very conditions which will make
me recreant to my royal father's memory, and
be as it were an endorser of the justice of his
murder. By the soul of the Confessor, I will
bind myself to no conditions to regain that which
is lawfully mine. My lords, I will nevertheless
advise with you!"
" May it please your majesty to read to us
such passages of General Monk's letter as may
enable us to advise your majesty "
"Listen."'--
"' Your majesty's restoration is the wish of
my breast. That achieved, I am content to lay
down all power and retire to private life. I am
at the head of an army of ten thousand men. I
am encamped near London. I have power to
wield the Parliament at my will. As yet they do
Clot suspect my intentions, which alone I now
reveal to your majesty. If your majesty will
consent to the conditions herewith enclosed, I
can safely invite your majesty to London, and
insure you a public reception that will surpass
any public entry of a monarch since the days of
the Conqueror. These conditions I know the

a reply, I entreat your majesty; and I pray do
not refuse to comply with conditions, without
which I fear the restoration can never be effect-
ed. The hearts of the people are with your
majesty;
"Now, my lords, here are the conditions."
The prince then read from a paper enclosed
in the letter the conditions which history has
made familiar to every reader.
" You perceive, my friends," he said, when he
had concluded, " what chains they would shackle
us with!'
" Nay, your majesty," said the earl; " but rath-
er with what rivets they would strengthen your
throne !"
" Ha ! think you that way, my lord I'
"I do, your majesty. The people no doubt
would receive you without conditions. But the
Parliament must be humored."
"I will truckle to none of them!"
"Nay, your majesty, but something must be
yielded on account of the disjointed state of the
times, and the imperfections of men's loyalty."
" Well, you no doubt counsel wisely. Guil-
ford !"
" Your majesty," answered the young fisher,
man, who stood near an escritoire a little in the
rear of the king. He was dressed in a hand',
some suit of plum-colored velvet, richly em,
broidered, a silken vest and laced doublet, and
his hair flowed long and waving upon his shape-
ly shoulders. In the interval of two or three
years since we last parted with him, a change
has been made not only in his appearance but in
his position. The prince had become personally
attached to him from the day he had assisted in
effecting his escape from England, and gave
him a position near his own person, as his pri-
vate secretary, a situation of responsibility, which
Guilford's talents, address, and, thanks to his
mother's good education, enabled him to fill
with credit and honor. At length he became so
useful to the prince, that the latter could hardly
bear his absence; and he always consulted him
on all matters before bringing them'before his
nobles; and after any council, at which Guil-
ford was ever present as secretary, he would talk
oter with him the debates, and search his opin

TEin abrupt departure of the fiery noble
caused a momentary excitement. The prince
looked displeased. The earl smiled haughtily,
and young Edward Percy, recently become Earl
of Percy, stole out after the noble.
But he had no sooner reached the vestibule,
than he saw Lord Rudolph draw his sword, and
with the flat of it strike Guilford, who at the
moment was walking across the corridor. Our
hero had remained a few moments in the cabi-
net to seal and address the letter to General
Monk, and when he was returning to the hall,
he met Lord Rudolph face to face. The latter,
the way being narrowed by two columns, on
recognizing him, cried:
" Stand aside, dog!"
Guilford's sword was in his hand, but recollect-
ing that he was the brother of Lady Kate, he
suppressed his rising resentment, and was pass-
ing him, when, as we have said, Lord Rudolph
struck him in the face.
" Now, by the red rood !" said young Edward
Percy, as lie beheld the blow, "if Guilford stand
this, he hath caitiff's blood in him indeed!" ,
Guilford, however, kept his sword point down,
and would have gone by him, when Rudolph
spat upon him, accompanying the act with an
epithet of derision.
The forbearance of our hero was now at an
end. He forgot Lady Kate's brother in his own
insulter. Throwing himself upon him, he took
his sword from him and broke it upon the pave-
ment, and then, with the eye of a lion, he glanced
upon him with contempt, and was going into
the hall, when the prince and several nobles
rushed forth, having heard the ecufflea

" What means this ? What is this drawing of
swords in our very presence ! The person of an
ambassador is sacred. Guilford, you are under
arrest."
" Your majesty," said the young Earl Percy,
"Guilford is not to blame. Lord Rudolph in-
sulted him, and he bore it ! He then struckhim,
and yet lie bore it. He then spat uponb'him, and
your secretary took his sword from him and
broke it under his feet, as you see there !"
"Then it is Lord Rudolph Vane who hath
done this discourtesy ?" said the prince, redden-
ing with anger. " My lord, I supposed thou
hadst come hither to us as a messenger of peace,
not a maker of brawls."
" I shall not give account of my conduct to
one who has neither the right nor the power to
exact it," answered Lord Rudolph, haughtily.
" This to the prince's face !" exclaimed Earl
Percy, with a flashing eye.
"Nay, Edward ! We can forgive this rude-
ness."
"I would punish it, your majesty, but that he
hath but one hand, and it would not be taking
him on fair terms," answered Edward.
Lord Rudolph had kept his right arm wrapped
in his cloak, a custom  which he had followed
ever since his recovery from his wounded wrist.
He now thundered back, forgetting that Red
Hand was present:
"Thou list !"
"What ! But we will make thee show thy,
self a liar !" retorted Edward, and suddenly
tearing from his cloak, he exposed the handless
wrist. There was a shout of si-prise from all
around ; and Lord Rudolph, with his left hand,

" And the people at large, do they wish for
the prince ?"
"Do they ? they would darken the very skies
with their caps in the air, if he should come into
London to-day. Ah, he is a brave prince, and
we all love him. We dare to say so, now Crom-
well's day is-gone; but once it was as much as
an honest man's head was worth to speak about
him.",
While Guilford was talking with the commu-
nicative and loyal host, there was heard up the
street a shouting of men, and then the clangor
of a bugle, and a moment afterwards the cry on
all sides:
" Monk ! Monk ! Here comes the general !"
Guilford's blood bounded ! He was more in-
terested than all others in his coming, and as he'
rode past, accompanied by half a dozen field
officers and an orderly or two with a body guard
of eighty horse bringing up the rear, he could not
but regard with deep interest the man who held
the reins of the power of England, not for him-
self, but for the prince his master.
Without delay lie followed the troop of horse,
and at length reached a stately mansion, before
which he saw General Monk alight and enter.-
He was about to press forward to ascend the
steps, when he was put back by a dragoon, who
said:
" Not so fast, sir cavalier. No one enters
here without an order-no they don't."
Guilford looked hard in the man's face, for he
thought he recognized the voice. But a huge
red beard and a fiery moustache defeated at
first his scrutiny. But the man himself aided
him in the matter, for, after regarding Guilford
attentively, he said in a - gratified, chuckling
manner:
" What ! is not this master Guilford Gra-
ham?"
" Thou sayest truly," answered Guilford ;
" but if thon knowest me, do not speak it out so
loudly."   e
"And dost thou not know me? I dare say I
look too warlike for you to see through me. I
am Digby-your old friend Dgby !"
"Toby Digby ! Verily, you are nolonger like
yourself. Thou a dragoon ?'.
" Marry come up ! What would you have a
man do! I got my head broke so often by
Cromwell's troopers, that I learned the knack o'
head breaking myself. So, what with fighting,
I got my blood up, and when Monk's sargents
came down to our town 'listing, Jwas one o' the

first to enlist. It is a brave life, so long as w
don't have any fighting. But, bless us ! they
say you are with Prince Charles over the sea,
and he has made a lord of you !"
" The prince can hardly make lords where he
is, honest Digby. I am glad to see thee such a
changed man, and doing so well."'
" What art thou doing in England, master
Guilford ?"
"I would see General Monk.. Can you let
me pass, for old companion's sake ?"
" Marry, that will I. Go in ; and when thou,
bast done thine errand, wait till I am off guard,
and we'll have a rare gossip o' bygones."  -
With these words the trooper drew aside, and
let Guilford pass. Going by several officers who
stood in the hall, he came to an orderly, who
stood near an inner door, and said that he de-
sired to have a word of importance with the
general.
" Your name ?"
"It is of no consequence. Say I have letters
to him from France."
Upon hearing this, there was a murmur in the
hall, of surprise and expectation from the mili-
tary men and others in waiting, and Guilford
was scrutinized with curiosity.
" A messenger from France ! A courier from
the prince !" went buzzing from lip to lip.
" His excellency desires to see you," said the
orderly, re-appearing after a moment's absence,
Guilford, all travel-worn as he was, entered
the apartment of the commander-in-chief of the
army. The general bent his eyes upon him as
he came towards him, and then said courteously,
yet with animation :
"Did I understand my orderly aright ? Do
you bring letters from France ?"
" Yes, your excellency, from the prince."
"From his majesty ! exclaimed the general,
with a look of pleasure. "But how is this?
Where is Lord Rudolph Vane ?'
" He arrived, and placed your letters in the
prince's hands, but when the reply, which I now
bear, was ready, he got into some altercation
with some of the nobles and others, and gave
some offence to the prince, who entrusted the
letters to me, who hold the place of his private
secretary."
" You are then Sir Guilford Graham ?"
" At your excellency's service," answered our
hero, as he placed the pacque, which he had by'
this time unbuckled from his girdle, in the gen-
eral's hands.

mur of approbation ran through the cathedral.
The history of Guilford was well known, and a
thousand eyes sought to rest on the face of one
who had risen from a humble fisher's boy to be
the confidant of his king and the peer of lords
of the realm. In height, in comeliness of air, in
commanding person, there was no high-born
baron of them all who were present who sur-
passed him.
The king himself gave away the bride, and at
the conclusion of the benediction by the venera-
ble Archbishop of Canterbury, the sacredness of
the place did not wholly suppress very animated
applauses and hearty wishes for their happiness.
We have now come to the close of our story.
For further information of events that followed
these times, our renders are referred to the pages
of history. As a romancer, we have taken but a
page out of its records, in which we have endeav-
ored to show that virtue, honor, probity and
courage, rightly directed by laudable ambition,
will bring a man to the highest pinnacle of his
wishes; and that to succeed in life, it is not
necessary to mark our path with guilt, or mar it
with dishonesty. The right will always come
right in the end, and ends sought through wrong
doings will prove evil instead of good.
If our readers should ever visit the little fish-
ing town of Brithelmstone, in Sussex, the ruins
of the Castle Vane may recall to their recollec-
tions this story. If they inquire for the descend-
ants of Lord Vane, they will be pointed to Astley

Castle, a mile in the interior, where lives the
present Earl of Astley, the lineal descendant of
Guilford Graham, the first earl of that name.
Over the gateway it will be seen that the arms
are a tower with two oars crossed, and the motto
"LOYAL EN TOUT."
At the foot of the ruins of Castle Vane is an
ancient stone cottage, which any one will tell
you, if you inquire, is "King Charles's cottage."
If you go to the door and ask why itis so called,
a stout fisherman in the yard mending his nets
will answer, that many a year ago, in "the old
Parliament times," the Prince Charles was hid
there one night before he got away across the
channel. If you ask the man his name, he will
tell you that it is Robin Rengivell, and that he is
a descendant, in the eighth generation, from
Robin and Anne Rengivell, who dwelt there in
the Parliament days, and Robin was one who
aided the king's escape.
If you go into the little graveyard, you will
see a sunken grave-stone in one corner, on which,
with difficulty, you may decipher as follows:
" Here lyeth ye body of Toby Digby, who
died fighting valiantly for his king and country
Peace to his ashes."
The descendants of Earl Red Hand are still
among the noblest of England's aristocracy, and
it is an inexplicable characteristic of the race
that every eldest son of the progressive genera-
tions is born with a distinct impress of a min-
iature red hand upon the inside of the left palm

Occasionally a faint whisper of this would 11"marry in haste, to repent at his leisure."

'Twas true, Mary Maurice was just the un- thi
assuming person theyhad styled her; there was M
more practice than poetry in her everyday life, he
and in- the performance of her Christian duties ga
there was no needless or ostentatious show, but
her motto seemed to be, " Let not thy right hand G
know what thy left hand doeth." "
She found but little time to assist in the lead- he
ing objects of the day, confined as she was at 'ti
home by the care of her invalid mother, but to
many .of God's suffering children she had been st
as an angel of mercy, and many a widowed ro
mother's and orphaned child's heart had been th
made to rejoice through her instrumentality, and gi
indeed, she was admirably qualified to fill the ai
station to which she was looking forward.  h
As time sped on, the breach between-the vi
young pastor and a part of his flock, instead of
closing, seemedto widen, and so artful had been kstatw
several of his friends had joined them, and this, t
caused him unhappiness.                   d
Among the most zealous of his opponents, o
was Aunt Hetty, the village gossip, who delight- b
ed in slander and news-bearing, and any affairs I.
that did not relate to these, were looked upon as b
things of minor importance, as was plainly to be s
seen by the interior of her dwelling, where hern
breakfast table might be often seen standing till-
noon, and then, on her " dear Josey's " return
from his labor, he was obliged to content himself r
with what few cold bits he might chance to find,c
while she was going from house to house, vend-s
ing her "little talk'" by the wholesale.
The sewing circle had met on a Saturday
afternoon, as was their practice, and while the 1
rest of the company were plying their needles,
Mary Maurice was reading aloud to entertain
them.
" Excuse me for interrupting you, Mary," said
Ann Hart, who sat by the open window, "but I
see the 'village express '-the name by which
Aunt Hletty was familiarly known-coming
across the street, and she is looking up as though
she were coming here, and she has a world of
news to tell, for her mouth is wide open."
"The wicked, unprincipled creature !" said
Julia Lane, who, by the way, had had many a
spicy chat with the gossip, but did not care to-
have it known. " I think we had best give her to
understand that 'her room is much better than
her company,' if she comes in."
" Very true," said Mrs. Lane, looking up from
her sewing approvingly at her daughter. "I

ink that the best thing that can be done, is for
iss Maurice to continue her reading without
eding her, and we will all be very busily en-
ged with our work."
"0 , that will be too bad 1" exclaimed Eunice
rey, a merry, laughing-eyed girl of sixteen.-
I do love to hear the dear old soul talk about
r Josey, and what she ' took and told him,'
s so funny ; but here she is, at the door."
Creak, creak, creak, came Aunt Hetty up the
eps, and through the hall, and entering the -
om without ceremony, she threw herself upon
e first unoccupied chair, and taking off her
reen calash, laid it upon the floor by her side,
nd with the air of one quite at home, took her
andkerchief and commenced fanning  herself
violently, saying:
"La me, 'tis desperit rarm out if ye did but
:nowd it. 0, deary, what a wicked place this
orld is, aint it?" she continued, not appearing
o notice their evident disregard of her; "'tis
readfully so, dreadfully! Trewly the language
f the scriptur is verified, 'How has the fine gold
ecome dim.' Who would a' thought it, on him?
never liked him any tew well, though I wouldn't
leeve sich dreadful things on him, if I hadn't a'
eed um with my own eyes. Trewly, wicked-
ness stalks forth in high places. 0 dear, 0 dear,
what are we all coming tew ?"
Insensibly the book had fallen from Mary
Maurice's hand, and the greater part of the
company's eyes were fixed upon Aunt Hetty, as
she swayed to and fro on her seat, occasionally
groaning audibly.
"I don't know but it will be as well for you
to ask her, mother, what it is she alludes to, for
it is evident it is something more than common
from her appearance," said Julia Lane, in a
suppressed tone.
" Yes. daughter, under existing circumstances,
I think it will be," said Mrs. Lane, with an elon-
gated countenance. " What is it, Aunt Hetty,
that seems to trouble you so much "
" 0, the sin," said Aunt Hetty, " the unright-
eousness that there is on the airth ; 'tis truly sur-
prising; but before I begin my dreadful story,
July, take and git me a leetle drop o'-water,
for I feel kind o' fainty," she continued, glad of
an opportunity of tantalizing them for her cool
reception.

to speak of an affair of momentous importance pi
to all on us. We are brought to a critical pe- of
riod, perhaps more critical in many senses of the I
word, than any other within our remembrance- ri
hem-hem. Without doubt you all know what ti
I allewd to, and marters and things in gineral n
have transpire to make us conclude that the re- t
port about our minister is not totally without l
foundation; and now we have met to conclude a
what is best to be done in regard to this ex- I
ceedingly unfort'nate affair, and we hope that p
none will be slow in expressin' their opinion of b
this marter; and though there's much on my h
mind I'd like to say, I give place to some of my
brethren.. Brother . Hinds, what's your mind t
'bout this affair? I hope you'll express it freely,
and not be afeared of offendin' the people."
" Truly we ought not to be men-servers,"c
said Brother Hinds, rising with deep solemnity
depicted upon his countenance; " truly, we t
ought not to be, and as you all well know, Is
never did have no great opinion of our preacher.f
I never have liked him any too well since that
Sabbath he appeared out in that flaunting vestc
and a light coat-quite different from our good
old parson Moody, who used to wear his snuff-q
colored suit and white cravat, aluz tred jest so,
from year's end to year's end. But the dear
soul has gone to his rest, and we never shall see
his like, no, never," he continued, drawing his
handkerchief across his eyes. " But I fear I am
- occupying too much time, and in closing, I'll
speak right out what I think. I reely am
obleeged to believe every word of the story, and
think the quicker we dismiss him, the sooner."
" I agree with you there," said Mr. Silas Gree-
ley; "I've no opinion of our preacher, and I
think he aint none too good, and I've aluz
thought so. I can't think of nothin' but that
passage of scripter-Vanity of - vanities, saith
the preacher man, all is vanity-when I look at
him. I don't think there's much religion in
sporting a great bunch of gold watch-seals, now
I don't, and I told my Sukey as how I didn't,
the very fast time I iver seed him. I aint no
opinion of these new-fangled notions no how
you can fix it, I aint."
" I do not see, brethren," said an elderly, be-
nign looking gentleman, rising, "as you have
really brought anything of momentous import
against our young preacher, except the charge
that brought us together; and I, for one, am
disposed to regard it with some small degree of
leniency; for when have we had a more faithful

astor 4 Has he ever overlooked us in the hours
if our affliction ? Have his discourses been
asking in spirituality or depth? Has he ever
refused to assist the poor and needy? I admit
hat the fault brought against him is of a dark
ature, but then we are all more or less prone
o step aside from the path of duty ; therefore,
et us be lenient to our young and erring brother,
*nd instead of discarding him, assist him to rise.
The course we now pursue may be the turning
point with him. Say, are there not some of my
rethren who will join with me in saying, give
him one more trial ?"
"Do you think to get my consent to sit under
he preachin' of a drunkard ?" said Deacon
Goodman, fairly trembling with anger. "I
wont listen to his sinful pratin', not even for
one Sabbath; that's for sartin' !"
I will not stay to repeat more of the conversa-
tion, lest I trespass upon the patience of my
reader; but suffice it to say, that ere they sep-
arated, it was fully decided that the connection
between them and Herman Stanwood should be
dissolved.
Herman wondered why it was that he had re-
ceived so few calls during the week from his
parishioners, and as he bent his steps to the
dwelling of 'Squire Maurice, on Friday, he de-
termined in his mind to make some inquiries of
Mary, who, he felt sure, would tell him all she
knew of the affair. He was met at the door by the
'Squire, who coldly informed him that Mary was
not to be seen, and his visits henceforth could be
dispensed with. He could not have been more
surprised had the earth opened at his feet, and
with a bewildered and aching heart, he, hastily
returned to his apartment; but the longer he
mused upon the singularity of the affair, the
more dark and mysterious it seemed, and bow-
ing before Him who knoweth the secrets of all
hearts, he poured forth his full soul, and arose
refreshed and strengthened, fully prepared to
meet with resignation the worst that might be-
fall him.
On the ensuing Sabbath, as he entered his
desk, and his eye fell upon the deserted seats, he
was enabled to say, " Thy will, 0 Father, not
mine, be done ; I wait for thy bidding."
The story spread rapidly, and though there
were some who did not doubt his innocence,
there seemed to be no possible method of prov-
ing this, and in course of time, his connection
with the church was dissolved, and with aheavy
heart, he turned from the place that had become

ai -


THE VILLAGE GOSSIP.

endeared to him by many fond associations, to r
return to his father's roof, an altered man; for l
where now were the buoyant hopes which had f
inspired him on his arrival at L--? Allc
cruelly crushed by the fell breath of slander!
As the lumbering coach passed the dwelling of
'Squire Maurice, he cast his eyes towards theta
house, hoping to catch one parting glimpse ofV
Mary, but in this he was disappointed. If her
could have but heard from her lips the assurances
of her belief in his innocence, it would have been
as a cordial to his aching bosom; but he had
not seen her since the day her father requested.
him to discontinue his visits, nor had one word
from her reached his hearing; for 'Squire Mau-I
rice was a stern man, and had forbidden her inI
any way communicating, either by word or letter,
with the young ' scape-grace," as he termed him,
and poor Mary was obliged'to stifle all her sor-
rows within her own breast, and each day her
check grew paler and paler, and her step
heavier.
A new minister was called, to supply Her-
man's place-a benevolent and warm-hearted
man, and a devout Christian. The second year
of his labors witnessed a copious outpouring of
the spirit, and among the inquirers was Sam
Snell, who my reader will doubtless remember.
Many wondered what it was that kept him so
long out of the kingdom, for he seemed willing
to give up all,-but he and his Maker alone
viewed the hindering cause. It was not until
after many a painful struggle that he conquered
his pride sufficiently to request a private inter-
view with his pastor, and revealed to him the
part he took in the affairs of Herman Stanwood.
He freely admitted his innocence, stating that
when he came into his shop he was so faint that
it was with difficulty that he could support him-
self, and as he had nothing in the shop save ar-
dent spirits, lie urged it upon him ; that he re-
fused, but at length was induced to take it ; and
that he and his comrade had for some time owed
the young pastor a grudge for reproving them in
their evil courses, and they seized upon this
means to repay it, and, to his sorrow, it needed
not to be told how successful it had been.
Several months after the circumstance last

'elated, had one looked into Aunt Hetty's dwel-
ing, they might have seen her swaying to and
ro in her straight, high-backed chair, as was her
custom when deeply engaged in thought.
" Who'd ever thought it ?" she at length said,
'that parson Stanwood would ever a' come back
to preach to us agin. I raley think he's the for-
givinest man that ever was; and they aint done
none too much for him, to fix up the white cot-
tage in the lane and furnish it so smart and
tidy. It does my old heart good to look at Ma-
ry Maurice sense he's got back ; why, she looks
like another gal, and I took and told her so
t'other day, and how the sweet creetur blushed.
I raly think I was tew blame about spreading'
that story that made um send away poor Mr.
Stanwood ; and if the gal had pined herself to
death-an' I thought my soul she would-I
should a' felt awfully-awfully indeed ! I'm so
sorry 'bout it ; but it can't be helped now; but I
-guess the next time Hitty Mason gits caught so
aging will be a long spell from now. It's been a
good lesson, and truly, I am led to say, ' The
Lord's ways are a vast deal higher 'an ourn, an'
his thoughts are not as our'n are;' and it is for-
tunate 'tis so, for if 'twasn't, I'm sure I don't
know what on airth we should all come tew ;"
and here the old lady raised her glasses and
wiped her eyes. "Bless' me ! how's this ?" she
continued, " cryin' on sich a joyful occasion as
this ? I'm raley ashamed o' myself ; but while I
think, on it I'll run an' get that smart calico puff
I'm goin' to gin to Mary, and the nice thread
socks I've bin knittin' for the parson. Goodness
knows it took me long anuff to knit um; and
then I'll take and tell my dear Josey to take urn
along an' leave um to the white cottage as we
go up to the meetin' house. But hark ! what's
that? 'tis the bell a' ringing' for the weddin, and
deary, what a heap o' people are a' going. I'm
raley skeered, I'm so afeared I shall be late ; an'
I don't know who's got a better right to see Her-
man Stanwood and Mary Maurice married than
Aunt Hitty. If I hadn't took an' told Deacon
Goodman to git him back when I heerd how in-
nercent he was, mabby 'twould never a' taken
place, as I took and told my dear Josey."

BLUE-EYED JESSIE.                  99

[FROM GLEASON18 PICTORIAL DRAWING ROOM COMPANION.]
BLUE-EYED JESSIE.
BY MISS SARAN M. HOWE.

(NOME, Jessie, my darling," spoke the
mild voice of a pale, sad-looking lady,
to her sweet little blue-eyed daughter, " I wish
you to go to Mrs. Morton's, and see if she has
any more work for me, and tell her this is fin-
ished, but mother is too ill to carry it home her-
self, and therefore sent you."
" Yes, mother," replied the little girl, as she
carelessly threw a light sun-bonnet over her
brown curls, " but I mustn't stay,mother,must I"
"No, my daughter, I shall be lonely without
you, so be as quick as possible," answered Mrs.
Williams, sighing as she thought of her absent
husband, who had not entered his home for sev-
eral days. In her beautiful, blue-eyed daughter,
Jessie, she had endeavored to find consolation,
but the tears would come to her eyes whenever
she heard Jessie's oft-repeated question, " where
has father gone ?" and though she answered,
" he will be home presently, my dear," her heart
toldher it would be long crc he returned.
With a light heart and bounding step, Jessie
Williams left her mother's door, and proceeded
on her way to Mrs. Morton's stately dwelling.
She heeded not the gay trifles so gaudily dis-
played at the numerous shop windows, or the
gorgeous dress and proud manner of the many
people she passed, but kept steadily upon her
way, free-hearted and happy, and caring not for

the sneer of the crowd, which was often bestowed
upon her, notwithstanding they often said, "she
is very pretty indeed !"
At last her long and circuitous route was trav-
ersed, and she stood upon the steps of the
splendid mansion of Mrs. Morton. Her heart
beat quickly as she rang the bell, and she trem-
bled visibly as she awaited the answer of the
servant, to her question if Mrs. Morton was at
home. The girl remembered that her mistress
had said that " she was always at home to blue-
eyed Jessie." and she kindly bade her enter the
hall, and she would soon see the lady. A sweet
smile rested upon the face of Mrs. Morton as
the fair Jessie stood before her; for she was not
like the majority of the wealthy class, selfish and
cold-hearted, for, in earlier days, she had passed
through affliction's trying ordeal, and came out
bright and pure.
" Ah, Jessie," said she, " you have come a long
way for a little girl, and I think your mother
would not have permitted it had she been well.
She is not in her usual health, is she ?"
"No, she is quite feeble, and therefore sent mm
to return the articles she has lately finished, and
get her more work, if possible. If you have any
more to do. Mrs. Morton, mother would be
pleased to do it."
The lady hesitated, but in a moment replied:

" No, I have none now; but come again to-
morrow morning ; in the meantime, I will use
my influence to procure some from Mrs. Lawson,
for your mother, and I think I shall be success-
ful. Come to-morrow, Jessie."
"Yes, I will, and mother will be greatly
obliged to you for your kindness," answered the
little girl, as she turned to depart.
While Jessie Williams had been conversing
with Mrs. Morton, more than one person had
been looking for her return. When she passed
one of the many groups of people, that morning,
her beauty and the happy expression of her
countenance particularly interested a man com-
posing one of the company of idlers,-and turning
to a companion, he asked:
" Who is that little beauty ?"
"I b'lieve it's ';im Williams's daughter," was
the reply.
"What! is he in the city?"
" Yes, when he's anywhere."
" Will the girl return this way ?"
" When she goes home," answered the fellow,
turning away, as if the conversation was not
pleasing, at least, to him.
" I will speak to her, come what may," mur-
mured the first mentioned gentleman, at the
same time gazing far down the street, to ascer-
tain if Jessie was still in view. Then seating
himself where he could easily watch her coming,'
his mind soon reverted back to the sad memo-
ries of other years. Once a gentle sister stood
by his side, and he had loved her with a brother's
love-but she had gone, where, he knew not, or
that she was living or dead. The father, to
whom he had looked for advice and counsel,
sank beneath the weight of years and sorrow,'
into the grave, and the beloved mother soon fol-
lowed to her final rest. Though amply provided
with this world's wealth, still there was a long-
ing in the bosom of the son for something more-
for the companionship of some one whom lie
could trust and love, and upon whom he could
lavish the warm affections of his soul. Long did
he muse upon the events of other days, and dwell
upon their -memories, until his heart seemed
buried 'neath the sad and gloomy ruins of the
past. From these mournful reflections he was
roused by the appearance of Jessie, and hastily
rising, he made an effort to restore to his coun
tenance its wonted cheerful expression, although
his heart was far from happy. The next mo
meant a hand was laid upon Jessie's shoulder
and a kind voice said:

" What is your name, my sweet little girl?"
The large blue eyes of the child were raised
inquiringly to the face of the stranger, and not
until the question was repeated did she reply:
"Jessie Williams ; but they call me blue-eyed
Jessie."
" Jessie Williams!" repeated the stranger,
abstractedly; and again his mind went back
through the dim path of years to that fair-haired
sister, the pride of his earlier days.  Again
memory began to bind him with her silken
chains, but hastily recovering, he said to the
wondering girl:
"Is your home far from here, Jessie ?"
" But a short distance, sir," replied the child;
" it is on L- street."
" Will you allow me to accompany you there ?"
"Certainly, sir," answered Jessie; "folldw
me"
After following the girl through several streets,
the stranger entered a small, half-ruined build-
ing, whose only occupant was the pale mother
of Jessie, Mrs. Williams. She seemed surprised
at the appearance of a stranger, but with a sweet
smile she bade him enter, for she hopedhe might
bring intelligence of her husband, though she
feared it would be far from pleasing. By de-
grees he drew her into conversation, by asking
questions respecting Jessie, her education and
employment, until Mrs. Williams felt that though
he was a stranger, he seemed like a sincere
friend.
" I have a favor to ask of you, Mrs. Williams,"
said he, kindly, " and I hope you will not re-
fuse."
"1I shall not if it is reasonable, sir," answered
she, " and if you will name it, I will soon tell
you."
" I have taken a strange interest in you and
your daughter, Mrs. Williams, and I have a
great desire to know your former history. If it
be one of sorrow and suffering, then can I sym-
pathize with you; for grief has often been my
lot. Do not refuse my request, I beseech you."
l   The lady hesitated for a moment, and then
raising her head, she replied :
"Yes, I will tell you my early history, but it
is indeed a sad one. I should have said my
later yeats have been the saddest of my life, for
- my childhood was passed in sunshine and flow-
ers. I will be brief, for it calls up sad recol-
lections. Myself and my only brother were our
parents' darlings, and high hopes were enter-
tained of our future usefulness and worth, by

our fond friends. We grew from childhood to-
gether, happy in each other's society, and not
dreaming that'sorrow would ever be our por-
tion, until the dark cloud settled upon our path,
and separated us, I fear, forever. The son of a
neighboring gentleman won my affections; but
neither my parents nor brother would consent to
our union, as they said James Williams was a
profligate, reckless young man, and I should
never be his bride. For months I Was sullen
and unhappy ; but with earnest and oft-repeated
entreaties, my lover at last persuaded me to
leave the home of my father, and link my des-
tiny with his forever.
" Two years passed happily away. My hus-
band was all'a wife could wish, and a happier
home than ours it would be difficult to find.
Since I left my father's home, I had heard nought
of him, yet I regretted not the step I had taken,
for I was happy, and that sufficed. With a view
of bettering our worldly prospects, we removed
to the city, but alas ! it was the destruction of
our happiness. ~ My husband soon fell in com-
pany with the vicious and vile cf the city, by
whom he was persuaded to take occasionally a
glass; but it soon was found to be true that he
often drank without persuasion. His down-
ward course was then rapid. Many times have
I sat and awaited his coming until my head
and heart ached with grief and fear, and often
did I weep till my brow seemed bursting, but it
would not bring back the happy days of our
married life. Thus five years passed; my hus-
band still becoming worse, until I lost alb hope

of his reformation. The companionship of my
only child,-Jessie, has been my only solace, and
that she may never know my bitter misery, is
her sad mother's earnest prayer. My father and
mother have been laid to rest in the grave, and
my brother is-I know not where. Should it
please Heaven to take from me my gentle
daughter, life would be a burden not to be borne ;
but while she yet lives, I will live for her sake.
I have thus given you my history, briefly,,it is
true, but truthfully, and may it tell you how
much a woman can suffer and yet be strong."
For a few moments after she closed, a deep si-
lence reigned. Each seemed wrapped in thought,
when the stranger quickly rising, threw back the
dark locks from his brow, and advancing to Mrs.
Williams, said, in an impressive tone :
"Elsie, do you recognize me now ?"
She raised her head, and the only words
spoken, were:
"My brother!"
" My sister I"
Ten years have passed since the eventful day
on which the brother and sister were again united,
after long years of separation and suffering, and
happiness is again their portion. The white
cottage on the hill is the residence of James and
Elsie Williams, and their beautiful, blue-eyed
Jessie, now a blooming maiden of seventeen.
The father is a temperate and happy man, but
he persists in saying that he should have been
in a drunkard's grave, had it not been for the,
exertions of Elsie's brother and his own darling
" Blue-eyed Jessie "
