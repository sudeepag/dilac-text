'He goes to night to the Salon Sainte. Lou.

'Bien! I wish you a good night, Mon-

Une bone nuit, Monsieur,' responded the
old concerge looking through'thewicket after
him as he rapidly moved away 'in the direc-
tion of Rue  an   Louis. 'Pardon! He
is briefof spe.ch to night, and yet he spoke
courteously, calling me each time 'Moin

plain 'Potier,' as if the porter to the man-

becomes us citizens of.the old eime to see
that this office be kept in its dignity. What

voice and accent are like that of that young
Spaniard who once6r twice came here with
master Florence. I would like to have him
call oftener so that he always give me the

Thus in 'a voice half muttered, half grat
ified soliloquized old Roger le Roux the
porter of the noble mansion of M. Gregoire
Noel 'one of the 'wealthiest citizens and oif
one the oldest and most aristocratic families
of New Orleans.
The person in the black crape visor kept
on his way in the direction of Rue Sainte
Louis: and as he approached the glare of
lights that issued from the cabarets and cafe
saloons in the neighborhood, -he drew his
capote closer about the lower part ofhis face,
as if not wholly trusting for thorough dis.
guise to his mask. A merry pageant that had
just passed up Rue Toulouse with a band of'
music had' drawn all the idlers from the lonjas
and doors of' the wine-shops in its train.-
Stopping a moment here he glanced towards

silk stocking was adjusted with perfect neat-
ess.- Her headwas gracefully coifed by a
lack lace veil that 'descended in front as
ow as her mouth revealing a pair of cherry,

,hin in -the world.
'Will monsieur, be' so obliging as to say
ow one can obtain admittance into the Salon
5ainto Louis to-night? asked the female.
Jerome Jacot was a good-looking bour-
Noise of eight and -twenty, with a toerable
erson, and a tolerable share of admiration
or it, as his well-trimmed and scented mus-
ache, and trim whiskers anud locks bore tes-
imony. Next to self admiration comes ad-
miration for the fairer portion of creation.
erome loved to gaze on the sparkling faces
)f the beautiful dark eyed Creoles that pass-
d him as he stood on guard, and think of
matrimony. He always had a smile and a
pleasant 'bon soir,' or 'bon jour,.madamoi-
elle,' for every one of his own class.
'It is like coming up to a-masked battery,
madamoiselle, to talk with a lady who hides
her -eyes with a veil,' said Jerome with gal-
antry.
'Will you answer me, gendarme, if I
will lift the veil? asked the .same mellow
tones.'
' Yes; and, if I could, if your face prove
as beautiful above your nose as 'below it, I
would try to get you in, ma belle fille '.
The young girl slowly, very slowly rais-
ed her veil laughing in a low, half suppressed
musical tone as she did so. I
' Oiel'R exclaimed the gendarme step-
ping back with an expression between fear
and laughter.   -
Now your promise, monsieur'
'Sacre! I did not expect to, see a hid-
eous negro's mask under the veil,' he an-
swered in a. tone of disappointment. 'But,
I will do as I promised. .Misericorde! but
what a mixture of devil and angel, light and
darkness in your face !I will wager that
there is something better behind that half-
mask.'
'I dont take bets, monsieur gendarme,'
she said dropping her veil again over the
black visor. 'But I will help you make out
your stakes when you next bet at roulette in
the cafe over the way.'
'I never bet at roulette, madamoiselle.
I always lose by the rouge if I bet on the noir
and then if I bet on the rouge the noir al-
ways wins! I never hit it but once right in
my life. I always bet at faro, madamoi-
selle.'
' There is a stake then for your next game,

his hand a five fran c piece.  . .   -

With this menace Benito with the shaggy'
head left his pbs+'and todk- his way towards
the 'door'through which-his guest had disap

let out by 'Befito for lodging-rooms to his bet-

pay best. -'Berii'Soto was a seaman and his
guests were usually-of tlisclass of men. This

The Spaniard, or Don Rafael as we. shall
henceforth call him, was just entering the
cabaret from the street when the [young giel
who 'had bnens speaking' withthe gendarme

observe'his movements.

it froin the ceiling to the floor through whieh
came a rich glowas if froma lightwith in. She
turned alkey'in the door and entered. The
apartment presented a singular'contrast to the
rough and mouldy exterior of the steep-roofed
f edifice. It was spacious, and furnished qpM
i that luxury which so often strikes the eyb 'of
the passenger through the half-opened doors
of similar structures as he wanders thrimkh
the streets of the French Municipality. The
two tall windows as well as the door, were
hung with long crimson curtains relieved by
muslin drapery with deep worked borders..
A French couch, partly hid by'a screen stocd
at the back of the room, and a sofa, and al
handsome buffet, glittering with silver 'and
glass, were -on the side. Articles of luxury
were placed about the room as ornaments,
ard oVer the mantle was a' shrine ofthle Ma-
donria before which burned a wax candle, time
only light in the room; but by the soft rich
glow of which, reflected floin the crimson
curtains, all these objects were distinctly vis-
ible.
She had opened the door softly ind closed
it in the same manner like one who would niot
be heard. She then went towards the door
which communicated with'the adjoining apart-
ment, saying,
' I can tell if Louis has come through by
the fold in the curtain. Yes,' she said with a
look of alarm! 'The fold is ot as I left it!
He has been in and missed me! Well I will
tell 'him I only ran out to look at a carnivat
procession. ,He has left the door ajar, too!

Perhaps it was Behito who cane into the room

She *as right., Benito on entering'the oth-

And the beformned with a low toned laugh aps
proachea the door and rapped. Hearing no

room.' All was quiet. The wax candle burn'
ed before the Madonna, and all was still. He
entered and looked carefully round and satis-
fied hiinself 'that theloccupant was absent.
'There is no danger, senor. Madame Louis-

-Now, senor Don Rafael, what good news s
has given me the honor of this visit.: It is a v
long time since we met.'    I -I        .
' It is no good news,' answered the Span- n
iard. 'Benit~o, I need your services in a matter
of deeper moment to me than you can con- a
eive.'                    .r.
'Love ?' repeated the maitre de cabaret.  l
' Yes in plain words, love.' -
'How can I serve you?'                 l
Listen !'
(' Yes, I will listen,' said Lousiette to her- 
self, who had entered her room unheard and f
at this moment was looking upon them through
the partly open door, her form hid by, the cur- t
tain before it.]
What she listened to will not be necessary f
to reveal here. The conversation .continued a
for full half an hour and at times, on the part t
of the Spaniard, was loud and warm. At t
length they both rose and Benito let his visit- t
or forth by the door that opened upon the:
street. At the same moment Louisette made
a noise of opening and closing her own door
as if just conie in, a noise wihch effectually
deceived Benito.t
'Ah, bueno! Madamoiselle Louisette has
kept abroad just long enough,' he added as he 4
heard'her. 'She would have heard a capitalI
secret with her two ears if she had been all
the while in the next room even with the doorI
shut and the curtain down; for Don Rafael is
not gifted with the softest voice, especially
when he is excited. Ah, this is a rare matter,'
he added as helocked the door after bidding
his guest 'IBuenas, Noches.' This -is a rare
affair,[Iand I have given , Don Rafael a spice of
wisdom that will effect his object as well as
stilettoes. I am tired of using steel. Nature
has given me a bounteous head and 1 will use
it instead. I will put my wits against other
villains poignards! Don iafael at first thought
n )thing could be done without a dagger. Wit
is sharper than a stiletto.. Ah, Madamoiselle
Louisette, there you are peeping in. Do you
fall in love with my handsome head. You
see I have no need to go to the expense of
a mask at carnival!    Nature, hath been
kind-'
' Ai, Monsieur.Benito,' said Lonisette, I
ami glad to see you so good-natured to night.
You are usually so very savage.'. She spoke
playfully. But the Deformed's good humor
was not 'long lived,' and he allowed no one
but himself to make jesting allusions to his
personal aspect. He would allude to his hid-
eousness himself and seem to mak" %t and
mirth of it; but it was from a mnvbed prinei.
ple of self-defence, lest others should fore.
stall him and make him their jest. The Span-
iard had left a purse heavy with gold in his
hand and this had 'made him feel in good hu-
mor. But it is dangerous to triflewith men
whom nature has caticatured,   .
' And what can you -Iok for in a-beast but
savageness?' he replied to .her in a growling
tone~of ferocity,      ,  - .:
' Merci ! Monsieur Benito,' screamed Loui-

with me.' .
No, tnq child! -Yotr are good-you meant

' Now you are an angeltMonsieur Benito,'
aid Louisette laughing and speaking ink a
merry .musical tone ; and she -extended her
ittle soft olive brown hand to him. He took
t with his thin pale hand, the veins in which
ooked like a net work of blue threads, and
would have kissed it; but she drew it from
hin before it reached his lips and held up her
rore-fitmger with a playfully threatening air.
'Pronez garde, Monsieur Benitol I shall
ell Louis.'      4 1-'*1            -
' Louis is my good friend! I would not of.
rend him. But you -are verybeautiful, Mad.
imoiselle Louisette! It must be a happiness
to be beautiful,'.he added in a tone of'mixed
bitterness and sadness. 'Is it not a happiness
to know that your fellow beings look-on you
with pleasure, Madamoiselle?',
She was impressed by the earnestness and
dejection of his voice and manner.
' 1 pity you, Monsieur ,Benito,' she said
touchingly.         -
'Pity C'he repeated in a. disoleased- tons.
'Yes, you pity me! I am pitied-I am only
pitied! It is something- to have you -pity,
Madamoiselle !. It humanizes.-,me! . But 1

would rather have their hatred yea, their de-
rision, as I often have ! - Oh, Madamoiselle
it is a curse to be hideous in men's eyes! I
sometimes have gnashed my teeth and foam-
ed at the mouth when I thought upon myself.
But one can bear-up against men. But to be
a thing of fear and bathingg to the fairest of
creation-to be shunned and pitied and never
lookedkindly upon by the young and the
beautiful-this it-is, Madamoiselle, which
makes existence such, as mine a curse!'.
' You feel too much, Monsieur,' she said
with sympathy.  -  .               -..
' I have felt; but Ido not feel now,' he said
in a deep voice. 'The time is ,passed when-I

' Loved, Monsieur Benito ?'.
Louisette could not suppress with the ex.
clamation a searcelyperceptible note of laugh-

and he clenched-his thin .hands and stamped

the saddle and fell abnost insensible into his
arms.
"I am not accountable to you, Noel, 'for my
acts,' retorted Rafael Valdes with ill-conceal-
ed rage. Leave my horse's bit! You shall
dearly pay for this interference !'
'Be it so. I fear not your threats, Valdes,'
he said transferring Louisette -to the care of
old Roger the concierge who had come into the
street to aid his master. 'This poor girl seems
to have been foully done by !. This is no harm.

'You have laid mischief for- yourself, Mon-

longer than lie was aware; for suddenly catch-

this purpose in its style of accommodations,
it isarival of the celebrated Hotel St. Charles.
The entrance to the .rooms appropriated tol
guests is on Rue Royale. It, was after' seven
o'clock on the evening of our story, a few
minutes after the rescue of Louisette and
aboutthe'time that Don Rafael and Bernito
crossed the portal of the old convent on the
secret errand, that a gentleman wrapped in a
cloak and-his face shaded by a low broad, hat
came from the direction of the mansion of
M. Noel and approached the entrance with a
free familiar :step. Before it were drawn up'
two or three carriages of the first citizens who
had doubtless called to meet friends lodging
in the hotel previous to going into the salon.
The black coachmen in gay lveries, a gen-
darme, and one or two negresses in scarlet
head dresses, stood aroundwhile two clowns,
in grotesque masks, in theit midst were amus-
ing them ; for scarcely a group that night was
without one or more buffoons, whoseJets and
broad wit made the streets ring with merri
went.
The jesters .were now aiming their wit at
each other instead of the passers by, as was
their custom. One of them was in all points
attired in the spotted, motley costume of a
boufon du cirque, wearing a ma-k painted
extravagantly and with an expression of most
mirthful grimace The other was a pauvre
diable looking jester, with patched and, rag-
ged habiliments, that looked more like the
forced costume of poverty than a voluntary
assumed.masquerading attire. He had more-
over hat .one sad looking shoe on, the the
other foot being wrapped in a part of a stock-
ing. His knees were bare; and one elbow
sticking out showed. that his upper man was
a stranger to the luxury of linen. His coat
had once, doubtless, rejoiced in two skirts,
but it now had but one, and this held by a
slight tenure. The upper button in front held
its place, and the only one that did so, and
being secured to the opposite button hole by
a piece of green string, kept his throat cover-
ed and supplied ingeniously the want of a
cravat and collar. The coat had once been
blue, and the pantaloons gray ; but it required
nice discrimination to arrive at this certainty,
for a more thorough tatterdemalion never
walked forth. This might have been regarded
as a chef d'ouvre in masquerading costume,
but for the bare knees and foot; which, as the
night was cold and chilly, with a heavy mist,
which the-street lamps would scarcely radi-
ate, seemed too much like necessity to be as-
sumed. Above all he wore an old -mask not
worth three sous. But never a merrier, laugh-
ter exciting mask had flourished at Carnival.
To look at it was to laugh, and to repeat the
look ht  laugh again; and the mirth was
heightened by the extraordinary contrast be..
tween it and the wearer. He had but the
moment before come round the corner where
he had been holding discourse with Jacot, the
gendarme. As he made his appearance in

bouffon was entertaining his little circle of
listeners, the latter stopped short in the midst
of a jest and stared at him in silence. He 'saw
he had a rival of an extraordinary character.
''Bong swor, camarady,' said the ne w-comer
shuffling up among them as well as he could
for his one shoe and stocking. 'How do do.
brother. Dontstop for me ! I never intrude !
Laugh away, and be merry, that's my motto,
Sing to day and cry tomorrow!'
'Is that your own costume, Monsieur Chif-
fan ?  What chiffonier have you for your
tailor?' asked the clown, turning him round
andlsurveying him on all sides. -
'It's my-own, brother! I'm a poor devil,
you see, and have had to keep myself dark
coz I hadn't any thing to wear better than
flowing robes; but they are fashionable in
carnival and so you see I am sporting 'em !
It's a brave thing, brother, to be able to walk
the streets again, and make one's rags a holi-
day suit.'
' Marry, butyou're a queer jester4' said:the
clown, laughing and clapping him on the
shoulder. ' But I don't know, Monsieur Le
Chiffon,* whether you are in earnest or not.
I am in doubt still whether you are really a
mask proper or a pauere diable, which I should
call a mask improper. Allons! give me and
these gentlemen an account of yourself, your
birth, parentage, your name, age, expecta-
tions, and the ,amount of' your worldly pos-
sessions and appurtenances. For, I am king-
jester hereabouts and no rival who shall not
prove himself equal to me, shall have place
on the pave.'
1 I came into the world crying;- my parent-
age I trace quite up to Adams; my name is
Joel Trulock; my age is seven and twenty;
my expectations are that your honorable wor-
ship will invite me to take a glass of noyeau
with you and this honorable company in the
caf# over the way; the amount of my worldly
possessions is this mask, and all my appurte-
nances are these tatters!'
Notwithstanding the lively tone in which
the merry mask rattled off this, in the closing
words his voice fell and there was visible a
slight tremor, as if behind the grimacing vi-
sor, was hid deeper emotion than he would
have exposed to his fellowmen. The emotion
did not escape the notice of the clown. In a
low voice of pity he turned and said to those
around him in Creole French,
' Ai, citoyens, il est un pauvre! un misera
ble. There is-no masking here; no jesting
for me with guenilles like these!'
'Non, non, monsieur!' responded all pres-
ent with a feeling that did credit to the heart
even at such a time of wild license, when
every thing became materiel for jests and
jokes.
' Pauvre garcon!' said, in a feeling tone, a
fat mulatress, with an orange-colored ker-
chief, bound about hser head, dressed in a
flashy blue and red striped silk gown, and
* qivln to M. Ragamuffin.

er.'Young man,' he said in English, 'I have
heard your reply to this mask. Are these
rags real indications of your poverty or are
they assumed for the carnival? As he spoke
he turned so that the light revealed the fea-
tures of Florence Noel, who had but a few
moments before parted near his house from
Louisette and the young buccaneer. The
tone of his voice was serious and betrayed ini-
terest.
'Yes, monsher,' replied the merry looking
mask in the accent of New England.
'Are you truly so destitute that you can
only appear abroad at carnival, because your
rags may pass for a masquerading costume?'
The mask was silent. The clown and the
others stood around Istening. At length he
answered in a tone evidently much moved;
but which there was plainly a strong effort to
conceal under the merry voice of reckless
hilarity which he had assumed to suit his
nask-
'I am truly a poor destitute devil, monsher;
but that is not enough to make a man cry,
while carnival lasts! I have had a three days
holiday and here and there have by favor of
my mask picked up a picayune to keep me
from starving. 'It takes but little money to
keep a man alive, I've tried that.'
'You seem very cheerful for one so poor,'
said Florence. Noel, looking upon the mask
not without a disposition to smile while his
generous bosom bled at the sight of rags, so
wretched that only the disguise of a carnival
would suffer them in the open streets.
'It's a poor creature will give up with his
fortunes, monsher; and 1 find a man can live
longer on jokes than groans  It makes a man
starve sooner to sigh much. I have cracked
many a joke with an empty stomach and it
helped me along as if I had cracked a nut and
-      eat the meat! A laugh helpeth a void stomn-
ach and maketh it quiet an hour long! Ah,
takeslit practice and patience and some philos-
ophy, messieurs, to know how to starve with-
out dying outright !'
This was spoken with recklessness, but
there was discoverable an under-tone of deep

4y."?

a huge boquet of natural flowers in her yel-
low hand, which was glittering with gold
rings;' he is very poor to be a jester!'
.' Mon Dieu! such ragsI and such a mask
grimacing above them, as if laughing at pov-
erty - said another.
I You shall drink with me, Monsieur pauvre
diable !' said the clown! But you shall have
brandy and not noyeau, which will do for wo-
men!'
'Brandy is too strong, monsieur! It gets
into my head.'
S'You shall then have what you will. Al-
Ions!'.
The other was about to follow the clown,
when the person in the cloak, who had ap-
proached the postal of the hotel, and had
paused to listen and -observe this scene, ad-
vanced and touched bimlightly on the should-

feeling and mental suffering in the cadence of
the, last few sentences.
tI could not laugh for the rags that would
bid me weep, mon ami,' said the clown.
' There be no patches in my soul, man. My
spirit hath no rent in it. Inside o'me I am as
good as I ever was '
'Thou art so humorsome, camarade; thy
poverty hath given thee such good nature,
that verily, I envy thee. I would not have
thee rich, thou art so roerry a poor man'!Un-
mask for use, bon camarade, else we will not
believe thee, for thou hast too well fed a
speech to have a starved abdomen.'
' Dost not see my hands, and my elbows ?
Have they not speech too?' he said extend-
ing his bony hand and shrivelled arm!'
',Mon Dieu! Thou art the veriest skeletons
ever walked about,' said the clown, with a
pitying tone mingling with his jest.
' Will you unmask?' asked M. Noel in a
tone of commisseration.
' Not here ! I am a poor outcast, but I have*
a little pride! I should riot have been so free
with my words had I not been under a mask.'
'I am M. Noel-Florence Noel. I reside
on this street, not very far from hence. Here
are two pieces of gold. Take them und feed
and clothe yourself in the nighest magazine.
Tomorrow call on me.'
Florence left the gold in his thin hand and
entered the portal of the hotel. The young
man stood looking after him with both hands
extended as if he would fly towards him to
embrace his feet He then looked at t be coin
and with a wild cry, something hetween a
laugh and a shriek, he started up the R ue Roy-
ale at a speed that surprised those whbo had
seen the weakness of his attenuated per-
son.
&amp; Le Pauvre! Sacre! The mani ii mad
with the gold!' exclaimed the clown  See
how he runs! He has already (list'! ppeared in
the darkness! M. Noel is generous. Vive
M. NoelI!'
This was responded to with animation ; for
all seemed to know young Florenm" Niel.
The group then began to speak in praise of
his generosity and also to talk (it tie mPauvre
diable,' who had been the object of' it, at this
time.
' The poor man never suffers. it M . Flor-
ence can hear of his need,'said a bomrgeoise.

said the gendarme. 'I know of mani- : poor

beautiful dame in all the metropolis. Whose

that we cannot see it is very superb!' he ad-
ded to the mulatto women.
'This is for Madamoiselle Emme. It was,
to be there at half past seven, as she wanted
to be at the bal at eight.'
'What is the masque she will wear, Mad-
ame;' asked one of the gaily attired negresses.
' That I must not tell, Madamoiselle Diane,'
answered the woman,- gravely shaking her
head, and continuing on her way. An arri-
val of a gay party of masquers in an open car-
riage at the door on Rue St. Louis, now at-
tracted and dispersed the group, the clown
resuming his mask and hastening to see them
alilit and to amuse the by-standers by his
jokes and jests upon their several peculiarities
of manner and costume.
Florence Noel took his way up a magnifi-
cent flight of stairs to a grand vestibule from
which several doors led to the suites of rooms
occupied by the guests and families sojourn-
ing at the hotel ; and others conducted to
the hall of the table d'hote, and the salon of
the masquerade on the Rue St. Louis front.
We will go back to a quarter of an hour be-
fore his arrival and precede him to a suit of
noble rooms on the side of Rue Royale to-
wards which, conducted by a servant to an-
nounce him, he was taking his way. The
suite consisted of three rooms; a parlor and
two inner-chambers, one of which was a cabi-
net de toilette. The parlor was furnished in
the most expensive luxury and contained every
article that could gratify taste or add to. com-
fort. Without indivualizing we will mention
broad mirrors in massive frames shining with
gold ; the gorgeousness of the damask- and
purple drapery of the tall windows d deux
battans opening upon the balcony on Rue
Royale; the costly girandoles, the fauteuil, the
ottoman, the oriental velvet covered lounge
of blue crimson, or violet colors, and heavy
with gold and silver fringe; the marble pier
tables with their costly burdens of porcelain
vases; the gilded volumes strewn around;
the fine paintings hanging from the walls;
and the thousand and one elegancies that con-
tribute to the pleasure and luxury of the opu-
lent and educated.
This was a private apartment, and the adja-
cent bed-rooms, one of which opened into the
other, appertained to it. These chambers weie
equally rich in their internal arrangements,
their couches with golden canopies and silk-
wrouight hangings; their alabaster layers and
full length toilet mirrors.
But one of the cressets in the chandelier in
the drawing-room was lighted, and gave just
enough light to give depth and tone, as a paint-
er would express it, to the interior of the noble
room we have described. Within the influ-
ence of this soft light stood a young lady of daz-

zling beauty. in her hand she held a green
vizor, and her costume was that of an Oriental
princess. Her height, the noble contour of her
head, the lofty yet sweet dignity of her air,
singularly harmonized with the imperial mag-
nificence of her apparel. Her hair was a dark
soft auburn- brown, and arrayed with great
simplicity and taste in the most elegant chain
of involved braids, through which was en-
wreathed a band of pearls, which passing with
the whole of the shining hair beneath her
ears, bound it together behind the head very
low in the neck, with a clasp composed of a
single pearl  Her complexion was exceed-
ingly fair, but not too much blonde; a rich
warmth giving to it life and glowing beauty.
She was-about nineteen or perhaps twenty;
but her manner had the repose and self pos-
session of a riper age. Her eyes which were
of the purest hazel, in which played the light
of a bright and cheerful spirit, were possessed
of an expression so soft, yet brilliant, so re-
tiring yet captivating, so daring yet shrink-
ing, so subdued yet so full of feeling, that we
despair of conveying it to the reader. He must
recall the beautiful eyes of his dreams, or re-
vive those of his fonder memories, if he
would form an idea.of the expression of the
beautiful hazel eyes of Georgiana Warfield!
He must also refer to the fairest lips and
brightest smile that he treasures in his heart
of hearts, if he would form something like a
correct idea of her mouth and smile.
Her features were feminine to the last de-
gree, and their faultless regularity and high
finish gave her, with the aid of her tall and
superb figure, an aristocratic look and air too
decidedly marked to be mistaken. Such a
face could be allied to no inferior lineage.
Colonel Warfield her father was a distinguish-
ed Kentuckian, and a lineal descendant of
the proud Earls of Warfield, to which title he
held by descent, and recent death of the late
Earl, a just claim; but he preferred rather to
be a citizen of a free republic than live a noble
in the sceptered empire of his fathers. He
was possessed of great wealth and this daugh-
ter was his only child. She had the year be-
fore accompanied her father to Washington
where he held a seat, and dazzled the capital
by her charms then just unfolding.  This
winter having resigned his political trust into
the hands of his constituents, Colonel War-
field had brought his daughter with him to
the gay metropolis of Louisiana. They had
been here now three months, and during this
period, the beauty of the belle Kentuckian
had fascinated and enchained more than one
noble and worthy young man.
Georgiana Warfield with all her beauty was
a sensible and thinking person. Her mind was
well cultivated, and for her heart nature had
done all that was needful. She was generous,
feeling, and full of high and noble impulses.
She did good unceasingly, and sweet charity
adorned her 'as with a crown of silver.'
She was now standing by a marble table
with the soft light of the girandole made ro-

The Grisette aud her Mistress-. conversa-
tion in which a discovery is made-The
Two Suitors.
TnE handsome grisette, Ninette, had clasp-
ed the diamond bracelet upon the moulded
arm of the beautiful Kentuckian; the slave
at her feet had laced the elegant silver
wrought boot securely around the fair ancle;
and the toilette of Georgiana Warfield was
complete   Ninette stood off a little distance
and surveyed her with admiration and a sort
of child-like awe.
'Ah, Mademoiselle, you are too much
elegant6 and beautiful!  You will conquer
andbreak hearts and triumph; oh, so great
will you triumph you will have all the gen-
tilhommes kneeling at your feet!  Is not
Mademoiselle Varfield vrai charmante ?' She
added, turning to the middle-aged slave who
had been Georgiana's nurse in infancy and
wap now her kindly treated friend and ser-
vaht. Ninette could not have appealed to
more partial testimony.
'Yis, Missy Marmsell,' answered Clara
with a bright look of patronizing approbation.
'Miss Georgy al'ays is a angel, and now she
look like de queen of de angel.'
'Oh, my good Clara, and Ninette,' said
Miss Warfield laughing, 'you will make me
so vain that I will have to wear something
graver for penance.'
S'Ah, Mademoiselle, you would look angel-
ique in any thing you please to put on. Eut
this violet robe is so becoming to your com.
plexion!  This tunic of silver tissue is so
magnifique! And your jacket of purple and
gold all laced so elegantly with the embroid-
ered'corsage! Never was anything so beau-
tiful, except Mademoiselle's taste itself, which
devised and created such perfect costume.'
'Indeed, Ninette, I must stop your two
little cherry lips, they prattle so!  1 believe
you rattle on only to please yourself that you
can talk a little English. You must not talk
so much!' And the beautiful princess en

seated by reflection from the crimson curtains
of the windows, falling upon her face as it
was cast down in an attitude of pleasant
thought. At her feet kneeled a female slave
engaged in fastening an azure silver-worked
slipper with silken cords about her shapely
foot, and by her side stood a youthful French
femme du toilette fastening a bracelet upon
her ivory arm. She did not, however, seem to
regard them or their presence, but was wholly
lost inher own thoughtswhich were pleasing,
and perhaps tender, to judge from the smile
that slept rather than played about the mouth,
and the soft color that deepened the roseate
beauty of the cheek.

which she had a few moments before come

' Bon, Mademoiselle Varfield,' said Ninette,
merrily. 'I talk English because it sounds
so sweet and musical when you speak it. And
you are very kind to speak it with me. Ah
Mademoiselle,' said Ninette, folding her
hands and sighing. 'I wish M. Florence
could see you now! He would fall down and
adore you!'
Georgiana started, colored deeply and then
said, in a tone of reproof, meant to be severe
but which was very gentle,
'You should not be so-free, Ninette? How
often have I reproved this forwardness.. It Is
not becoming, Ninette!'
' Pardonnez moi, Mademoiselle.' said the
grisette, casting her finely expressive eyes
doucely to the ground, and laying her little
dimpled hands across her bosom.
' You are pardoned, Ninette,' said her mis-
tress, laughing at her deprecating appear-
ance. The countenance of the grisette bright-
ened up at once.
4 Mademoiselle is so kind and good! I
hope Madamoiselle will have a good husband.'
And Ninette sighed.
'Again, Ninette ?'
'Ah, Mademoiselle, pardonnez moiI When
I see you looking so happy and so beautiful,
I sigh to think if you marry that dark-look-
ing Spaniard, Don Rafael, he will, perhaps,
make those fine eyes shed plenty tears, and
that jewelled corsage heave with many a
sigh!'
' Why do you think so, Ninette ?'- asked
Georgiana, struck with her manner, which
was unusually serious, or perhaps, better said
sentimental.
' He is said to be very wicked.  And I
have heard of cruel things he has done.'
'These are only the gossip of porters'
lodges, enfant,' answered her mistress with a
paler cheek, and a graver look. ' Don Rafael
is a gentleman of wealth and family.  His
father was a Grandee of Spain, his mother a
beautiful Louisianian of the last regime, and
related to the family of the President. He is
proud and perhaps^ haughty; but - he is a
noble gentleman, educated and esteemed.'
' Mademoiselle has only seen him here
when he assumed all he wished you to think
him to be,' said Ninette with earnestness in
tone and looks; of his private character he
lets you know nothing. He deceived you to
make you his wife, and then, aie ! Helas! he
will show you himself. Ah, ma chere madan-
ois6LVarfield, if you dont wish to be made
parfatement miserable, do not never marry
that wicked Don Rafael Valdes! I could tell
you more I have heard, madamoiselle,' added
the grisette coloring, hesitating and droppi'
her eyes while she let her fingers insensible
play with the ribbon of her coquettish little

cap which was not big enough to cover half
the top of her pretty round head.,
You needn't say any more, Ninette.'
'I hope mnadamoiselle is not offended?'
'No, Ninette.'
6 If madamoiselle would let me?'
' Well, child.'
'9I think that there is none of the gentle.
man that loves madamoiselle, that adores her
so much as Monsieur Florence!'
Miss Warfield dropped her gaze upon the
gorgeous carpet and began to drum upon a
velvet rose in its surface with the toe of her
silver slipper; for she was now seated on an
ottoman near where she had been standing,
while Ninette stood demurely before her a lit-
tle ways off, Clara the slave having returned
into the'cabinet de toilette.
I Madamoiselle is silent. Madamoiselle is
displeased.'
' No, Ninette. Go on. What have you to
say of M. Noel?'
' That he is a noble gentleman, and in
wealth and birth is equal if not superior to
Don Rafael, who though born in New Or-
leans is more of a Spaniard than 'a Creole;
for he has Ittle of the frank and manly bear-
ing of the generous Creole.'
'You have really taken quite a positive dis-
like to Senor Valdes, Ninette. How has he
offended you?'
' He has not offended me only that he should
presume to look to your hand, my noble Ma-
damoiselle!' she replied with zeal.
'You are very good, Ninette to interest
yourself so much In me,' said her mistress
with a bright but transient smile. 'You were
speaking. of M. Florence Noel,' she added
without raising her eyes, and in a tone as if
she would have. recalled the name as she
spoke it It was a faltering cadence. The
voice warmed and fulled an4 trembled in its
enunciation of it. A reader' of the human
heart-the skilful in woman's heart would
have marked this and feared nothing from the
influence of Don Rafael. The name she had
spoken he would discern was the talisman to
lay open the secret passion of her soul. Ninette
had not much experience or reading in human
nature; but she possessed that feminine in-
stinct which is wisdom and judgment. She
saw at a glance that there was no danger to
apprehend from 'the wicked Valdes;' and
her little heart bounded as if it would fly out
of her bosom, snugly confined as it was, un-
der a neatly fitting jaquette of scarlet satin,
with joy at the discovery.
' Ah, 14adamoiselle,' she said, her expres-
live face looking as sunny as a spring morn-
g    'I see I need not speak of M. Florence.
1 am so glad-so happy.'
' Why what does the little vixen mean?'
oried Georgiana blushing in spite of herself
still deeper than before, and with a look of
conscious intelligence giving expression to
her half-drooped countenance.
' I mean, Madamoiselle, that I was very
foolish and very much mistaken. But then

Don Rafael was so particular in his visits!
You rode out with him on horseback; and
he visited you so often--so much oftener
than M. Florence!. and you sang to him and'
'One. may do all this, Ninette, and not
love,' said her mistress smiling.
' Ah, yes, madamoiselle ! But Don Rafael
was rich and so attentive and bold, that I
feared for you! and all the while M.Florence
was loving you with such adoration and con-
suming away with his silent passion.  He
would not call often, and he was always so
respectful, so diffident, so gentle-so different
from Don Rafael, who would laugh aloud
when with you, and go out of the parlor
whistling and drumming the 'devil's tatoo'
on his boot with his riding switch.'
Miss Warfield smiled.. Ninette had good
reason, we must allow, for suspecting an im-
pression had been made upon the heart of her
beautiful mistress by the opulent young Span-
iard. This person's parentage has already
been spoken off. He  was a Creole Spaniard
of an American mother, and had been edu-
cated at Harvard University.  By the death
of his father, shortly after he came to matu-
rity he inherited an immense fortune which
he devoted to his pleasures. He moved in
the best society an acknowledged equal, for,
he kept his vices for his private hours. He,
therefore, possessed two characters for a long
time; one, that of a gay fashionable Creole-
whose time was passed in the rounds of
amusement which wealth can command;
the other that of a low, unprincipled sensual-
ist, and villain-of the worst description. One
class of men knew him alone in one charac-
ter; another class alone in the other  With
the one- he associated as an equal in social
rank; with the other as the mover in schemes
of villainy of which they were the agents or
else victims. He had early met in society the
beautiful Kentuckian, whose name was on
every lip arid the toast of every circle of
young Creoles, and his position in society
gave him a ready access to her presence
and acquaintance. Don Rafael was a man of
an elegant exterior, and he could render him-
self pleasing .to whomsoever he cared to
please. His talents were as varied as his
morals were perverted. The superb style of
beauty of Miss Warfield struck him and ex-
cited his admiration.  He at once became
enamored with her, if a man like him could
love; and having understood that she was
also an heiress, he resolved to leave no effort
untried to win her hand. There was also a
species of eclat in becoming the successful
suitor for a hand for which every young man
of any pretensions was sighing. Bold, con-
fident, and proud, Don Rafael believed he had
only to make the effort to be successful. He
became a constant attendant upon her morn-.
ing levees, always outstay ing others; he rode
with her on the river banks; he waltzed with
her; he promenaded with her; he was ever
her attendant. For a time he forgot his lower
pleasures in the society of one so elevated,

and whose influence was so purifying. What-
ever my have been his primary motives in
paying his cmrt to her, Don Rafael could not
long remain within the light of so much vir-
tue, beauty and grace, without feeling a: deep-
er emotion than the mere passion of the hour,
or only ambition for success! His heart was
taken captive, and his whole being Involved
in one absorbing feeling. Day after day is
passion deepened and strengthened, 'till he
confessed in his heart that his existence and
happiness hung upon her lips.
Georgiana Warfield, at first pleased with
the attentions of a man, elegant in person,
with expressive features, possessed of wealth,
and moving in the front rank of the best so-
ciety, and for whose attentions more than one
beautiful Creole sighed in vain, suffered this
intimacy to continue for several weeks; and
though she did not encourage his addresses,
she suffered them. At length, blinded by her
seeming pleasure in his society, and deceived
by her affability and condescension, he be-
came careless and self-confident, believing he
had only to propose for her band to receive it.
In this delusive opinion he became less cau-
tious in concealing his true moral character,
and in several instances of late had so far for-
gotten himself as to expose to her a heart
startingly corrupt and depraved. This dis-
covery led her to reflection upon his charac-
ter and intentions, and the result was a reso-
jlution, henceforth so to treat Don Rafael as to
show him that she was wholly indifferent to
him, and, however he might think, had no
place in her affections. There was another
motive also which we shall shortly allude- to.
The suitor was not long in 'discovering this
change in her manner ; a sudden change from
a frank friendly intercourse to one of coldness
and reserve.
' How is it Senora ?' he said to her with
something like anger in his tone a few
days before the opening of our atory, rising,
after a brief, embarrassed morning visit, and
standing near her;. ' how is it I find this cold-
ness of manner, and em treated almost with
insult ?'
'I witnessed a piece oferuelty in you yes-
terday, Senor Valdes, that has reversed my
opinion of you,' she said firmly. I
'What? merely riding my horse over a
crippled negro ?' he said laughing carelessly.
' I noticed you spoke to me then of it, but I
did not suppose you felt so much about a
trifle like that ! my horse was most injured,
and this morning he is fairly lamed!t' .'
'You may regard it a trifle to tread down
beneath your horse's hoofs -a miserable, crip-
ple because he does not soon enough remove
himself from your road. But I think very
differently.' I
'Are you serious?' demanded -Don Rafael
with a look of haughty surprise.'
The suiter bit his lip and endeavored to
suppress his displeasure. He laughed again,

but it was a bitter laugh; one of mingled de-
rision and vexation.
'It was this then that made you return to
the city?
'Yes, Senor.'
'And this is the cause of your present'treat-
ment of me?'
4 Not alone, Don Rafael.'
'This is coquetry ! It is affectation !'he said
angrily.
' Sir, you forget yourself, and to whom you
are speaking,' she said drawing herself up
with womanly pride, her eyes 'lighting up
with spirit. Don Rafael's magnet instantly
changed. He saw his fair prize was in dan-
ger of being lost to him. He flung himself
on one knee before her, partly with assumed,
partly'with real emotion, for he loved her
with'deep passion.
At this moment a servant announced,
' M. Florence Noel.
' Admit him,' she said with a look and tone
that was in singular contrast with her words
and air the moment preceding.
A soft, pleasurable glow took the place of
the flush that kindled her ceek, and retreat-
ing from the kneeling Don 'tifael, e 'ad.
vanced a step towards the door to receive the
visitor. Valdes sprung to his feet,,and with
a, dark, scowling brow, and flashing eyes,
stood surveying tne entrance. Thrice before
had le encountered Florence Noel here in his
visits, and even then a *spitit'of rival" feeling
disturbed his bosom. The evident pleasure
with which Miss Warfield now heard' him in-
nounced at once' inflamed his bosom with
jealousy. He resolved to 'wait and see him
enter, watch the meeting of the 'yes, the
tone and manner of her reception i 'to ee if
he could not draw from -them confirmation of
his rising suspicions, that not the'affitir of the
crippled slave, noriany other matter of the
kind she had witnesses, had produced the
change of her manner towards him; a change
he had observed not only this morning, but
had noticed even 'some days before
'1' Ah M. Noel. I am delighted to see you
this morningg' said Miss, Warfield receiving
him with a look of animation; perhaps, 'with
more than, under other circumstances she
would have shown. '1 *as planning a ride &amp;
cheral to the battle-ground, with my father
and was thinking of some friend who would
accompany us. Your 'lovely sister Emme, 1
have no doubt would 'oblige us with her com.
pany; and then we shaU ofcouise have you for
a cavalier!* she added smiling yet blushing.
'Don Rafael Valdes,'doubtless would be hap-
py to be of the party, but he has just informed
me that he has badly lamed his favorite hbse,
through the careless blundering of tin 'old
lame negro who was so foolish as to be in the
street,'and whom 'he run over!'
Don Rafael did not grind his teeth together
at this cutting ii-ony because he was toe cour-
teous; and he did not wish 'to show feeling
either before her or his rival-for such he
now believed the handsome young Creolu

who had met with so gracious a reception, to
be. He stood silent and boiling over with
rage and vengeance. Florence had nodded
to him as Georgiana named him,.and he re-
turned the recognition with a haughty bend
of his head.
'No doubt Emme would be delighted with
the excursion,' answered Florence, his heart
throbbing with a sweet trembling pleasure at
the gracious and friendly manner of - one
whom he passionately loved in the depths of
his heart, and whose very foot print, he would
have knelt and reverently kissed. True love
in a generous breast is ever humble. It low-
ers itself and elevates its object. It mani-
fests itself more in silent looks, in deep emo-
tions, than in words. Such was hitherto the
love of Florence Noel, for Miss Warfield.
He had seen her and loved her in silence afar
off. His love placed her too high to be ap-
proached, and he rather shunned than sought
her presence. To obtain a glimpse of her
passing, in her carriage was a rich repast on
which his wrapt senses revelled for hours; to
speak with her-for a few moments was a life-
long bliss! And intimacy had sprung up be-
tween his, scarcely less beautiful, sister Em-
me, to whom we shall soon introduce the
reader, and thus he was oftener thrown into
her society under circumstances favorable to
the growth of a pure passion like his. Each
day he felt that the current of his life was
mingling with hers; that from her idea his
soul was drawing all its happiness!
Too much interested Jin the gay and bril-
liant scenes around her, and given up to the
attention of Don Rafael, Georgiana at first
did not appreciate the character of Florence
Noel. But gradually its development opened
her eyes to his worth, and from indifference
she came to regard him with deep interest.
By this time she began to discover the shades
in the character of Don Rafael, and as each
day disclosed some moral flaw in his heart,
pach day brought to view some noble and
generous trait in that of Florence. To con-
trast the two young men under such. cireum-
stances was irresistable, and it is needless to
say Don Rafael suffered by it. At length
Georgiana discovered that she was by no
means an indifferent student of Florence No-
el's character; that it could not be studied
without being loved. She discovered, also,
what maidens are quick to see, that although
by look nor word had he ever told his pas-
sion, he sincerely.loved her. This discovery
led her to examine her own feelings, and she
confessed to herself with a sweet blush ofcon-
sciousness that if he wooed he should not be
said 'nay.'
Thus affairs 'stood with, the parties up to
the time of the scene we have just gone back
to narrate. Don Rafael stood a moment long-
er when finding himself totally neglected,. he
strode from the room giving, a' good morning'
in a tene of revenge I significance and fling-
ing as he passed him, a haughty glance of
defiance at Florence Noel. This scene took

place we have said a few days before the
time our story opens. Having now explained
the position in which these individuals of our
tale stand to each other we shall now return
to the drawing room again on the carnival
night and to Georgiana and the 'grisette, the
latter of whom was interrupted in her gossip
by a rap at the door, and the entrance of a
servant presenting on a salver, a card on which
Miss. Warfield read with a blushing smile
'M. Florence Noel.'
' Does M. Noel wait?'
' He is in the ante-room, Madamoiselle.'
'I will receive him.'
'Oh, I am so delighted, mademoiselle,'
'cried Ninette clapping her hands.
'At what?'
' That you love M. Florence instead of the
proud and wicked Don Rafael.'
' Hist you little Babillarde!' cried Georg-
iana looking as severely as a half-smile would
suffer her to do, at the grisette, who folding
her hands across her bosom, retired into the
cabinet de toilette though with one dark eye
over her shoulder to see Florence Noel as he
entered.
CHAPTER VII-
The Confession-The beautiful Creole- The
Masquerade.
M. Florence Noel on entering the drawing
room was enveloped in a large cloak and car-
ried in his hand one of those slouched hats
worn abroad by masquers.
'Pardon me, for wearing in my cloak, Ma-
damoiselle Georgine, he said, closing the door
before throwing-it aside. One does not al-
ways care to have his costume exposed to the
eyes of those in the halls.'
' Do not apologise, M. Noel,' said Georgi-
ana, her sweet, rich voice trembling with
emotion which of late on seeing him it had
got a habit ofdoing; an emotion mingled with
an expression of deep silent joy. She gazed
on him as she spoke with admiration. Never
stood a nobler looking person in the presence
of a maiden. Tall and elegant in figure, with
a face of great beauty; an olive complexion,
dark but rich: brown hair and mustache,; a
look of noble pride and an air at once modest
and commanding, the handsome Florence Noel
stood before herin the splendid costume of a
Persian Prince. She surveyed him in silence,
and her heart did homage before 'him.
' You will think me presumptuous,' he said
in a voice a good deal embarrassed, 'but'my
sister informed me that the secret of your cos-
tume you had made known to her, that of a
Per:sian princess. If I have been presumptu-
ous in assuming this, I will atone for it avy
any penance you may inflict.' This 'was

spoken with graceful gallantry mixed with dif-
fidence.
'Your penance shall be to return and bring
your sister Emme,' she said smiling. 'She
was to come here you know and go with me
into the salon under yours and my father s
escort.'
'Emme had not completed her toillete, when
I left; there was some delay in-the arriving
of her costume.  She will drive here in the
carriage immediately on getting ready.'
This was spoken with evident embarras-
ment. His eyes were down-cast, and his fin-
gers played nervously with the golden tassels
of his diamond hilted sword. Miss Warfield
began to feel her heart beat stronger, she
could not tell why, and her eyes also fell to
the carpet. There was for a few seconds an
awkward silence. At length Florence, his face
glowing with the deepest emotion, which
heightened the manly beauty of his dark olive
features, advanced towards her as she stood
beneath the soft light of the burning cresset,
and taking her hand knelt at her feet.
'Pardon- me, my dear Miss Warfield,' he
said in tones that seemed to come from his
soul, and which fell like the nusic of a harp
upon her ears, 'pardon me,for intruding alone
upon you without the company of my sister!
I blessed the delay which could give me a
few moments in advance to see you alone if
possible! Fortune has favored my trembling
hopes! -
He was silent! The hand be had taken lay
passive within his. The diamond studded ves-
ture of the startled, happy, expecting maiden
heaved irregularly!  The eyes .lay couched
beneath their fringed canopies, and met nol

in a voice agitated yet persevering. 'But]

permit her to assume ; * I feel honored by thi
confidence arid manly confession. of regar

worthy of your noble and generous attach-,

feelings in my own bosom first awakened by,
the contemplation of your pure and elevated
character, manifested in your filial attach-
ment to an imbecile parent and your affec-
tion-for your sister; feelings, which I am free.
to acknowledge has deepened and strength
ened with a mo-e intimate acquaintance.'
'Is it possible that I am not dreaming1-
Is it possible that my fears are all -t'oncei
scattered like a dark cloud, and that I am
not indifferent to her in whose existence: my"
very being is involved! 'exclaimed the hap-
py Florence with a joyful emotion that seem-
ed too deep for coherent utterance. le press-
ed his lips to her hand with grateful ardour,
and then seizing the other would -have kissed
that also.'
I 'No, no, Florence,' she cried, blushing and
laughing. ' I did not say in my little speech,
I to you that I should give you this permis-
sion.'
Florence was too happy to rebel ; and seats
ing himself by her side he seemed for the
next five minutes quite to forget that he had,
a tongue, and to think that eyes answered all
the purpose for which tongues were given.

'Your highnesses,' answered Emme, fold--
ing her hands upon her bosom and bending
gracefully low to the ground.
And have you been so kind as to choose
that costume on purpose to support mine and
be nigh me?' asked Georgiana with grateful
warmth.
Yes, my friend! And who should 1 be
near but she whom Florence most loves Oh,
1 am so happy that I know what I know!
He has, I dare say, been asking your pardon
for taking the prince to your princess, and
emboldened by your forgiveness, he has asked
to make you his princess and heart's-queen
for life!  Ah, your tell-tale looks confirm
what I guessed when I cane in!  Well, it
is the happiest event in my life, and I will
answer for Florence that it is in his. Oh,
don't look so very sly and innocent both to-
nether; and you, brother, don't handle that
tiara of pearls on the table so roughly. It is
for you to place on Georgiana's brow not to
wear on your wrist.'
The mauvais honte of the lovers gave way
before the lively and frank manner of the
charming Emne; and laughing, Florence
confessed to her whrt had passed, while Geor-
giana silently confirmed the tale with her eyes
and cheeks. Emume then again embraced her
kissing her with affectionate emotion. Flo-
rence now more at his ease, and with a coun-
tenance beaming with calm, rapturous joy,
then placed the tiara upon the head of Geor-
iana; completing, by the act, the fullness of
her wonderful beauty. Emme forgetful of
hersff was lost in admiration of her enchant-
ing appearance; and when Florence unfolded
from his cloak a crescent of diamonds and

his brows, she cried with enthusiasm, as he
rose and stood by her side,

sm il feet were faultlessly moulded.  Her
head was of a singularly beautiful shape and
placed upon her neck like a deer's in an atti-
tude spirited and airy. Her complexion like
h 'r brother's was brunette, but of the fairest
and warmest tint of the olive. Her hair was
dark brown of a rich and soft texture, and was
braided and intertwined in tasteful folds on
either temple. The crimson turban she wore
gave to the cheek a glowing tint, that heigh.
tene-d her charms. Her dark pencilled eye.
brows; her small straight beautiful nose; her
finely shaped mouth, deep red lips and pearl.
white teeth; her softly rounded. enchanting-
chmn, with her smile which like summer sun-
light played and danced in and among all,
composed a countenance of rare loveliness.
And those who k-new Emme Noel said that

her heart was as lovely as her face and person-
These two noble characters, Florence and
Emme were the children of M. Noel, a French-
man of noble family, who had in Paris marri-
ed a Lonisiainan lady of great beauty and ac-
complishments; and soon afterwards he set-
tled in New Orleans. Uniting his fortune to
hers, and engaging in commercial business,
he in a few years accumulated vast wealth.
But his happiness was destroyed by the sud-
den death of his wife, the seventh year after
her marriage. He was not, however, left
destitute. His two children Florence and
Emme consoled him for his loss; and all his
time and exertions were henceforth given to
them. Quitting his business and settling up
his affairs he devoted himself personally to
their education. But the loss of his wife,
whom he had tenderly loved preyed upon his
mind; and time, instead ofassuaging his grief
gave strength to his regrets. Florence had
attained his twentieth year when he could not
conceal from himself the painful fact that his
father was gradually losing his mind. This
affliction became more 'and more apparent,
till at length he was incapable ofreasoning or
conducting his affairs; though not yet fifty
years of age. Emme and her brother lament-
ed and wept over this misfortune to one to
whom they were so tenderly devoted; but the
object of their tears was insensible to the
wretchedness his situation produced in the
bosoms of his children.
In this condition M. Noel had been now for
five or six years past, confined to his . dwell-.
ing and giving no signs of intelligence, He
was a confirmed idiot. Yet with a devotion
unceasing and full of filial tenderness and res-
pect his children watched around his couch
or chair, and together attended him in the
carriage whenever the weather was pleasant.
In their hands he was passive and child-like.
This state of M. Noel was not generally known.
With a delicacy that cannot be too highly com-
mended his son had spoken of it to none, save
to *those whose intimacy in his house could
not but give them a sight to know it. The
world still supposed that be managed his own
estate, and that Florence was the dependent
upon his bounty'; but in truth Florence had
long had in his own hands the entire conduct
of his father's affairs.
We shall now precede the three personag-
es of our tale whom we left in the drawing-
room into the Salon, St. Louis, to which, by
passing through the oalls they obtained ac-
cess without descending into the street. On
gaining the vestibule of the grande Salon,
each enveloped in cloaks to conceal their
disguises, and wearing vizors so as effectual-
ly to defy any scrutiny of their features,
they found a scene of life and novelty.
Maskers were constantly arriving and as-
cending the grand stair-case, some in full
costume without cloaks and wearing masks,
others, studiously, especially the ladies, con-
cealing their costu-mes until they reached the
ante-roomn. At the head of the flight of stairs

stood two gendarmes with drawn swords in at
their hands, who directed the guests to the fr
ante-room. - Of these there were several, one.
for gentlemen two for ladies; one for the cloaks ci
and arms, and one which was used as a h
magazine fbr dominos and niasks to supply w
those who needed them, or wished to change a
or disguise their costume. Leaving his cloak v
in the ante-room in charge of a gendarme, p
who also demanded his sword, Florence met ti
Georgiana and his sister at the door of the an- a
te-room, and handing his ticket to a gendarme b
he entered the magnificent hall.The vast t
apartment was already filled with a varied fi
and splendid assembly; and the crash of the
music rose high above the murmur of a thou- (
sand voices. Fifty cotillions were on the floor t
and hundreds who were not dancing were h
promenading around the hall, bowing to, or C
stopping, to converse with those who wearied t
with dancing had sought the rich cushions
of the gilded alcoves which encircled the hall, s
to rest. All was gaiety, life, and splendor.r
A myriad of lights blazed in glittering chan- a
deliers suspended from the exquisitely painted s
ceiling, and diamonds added their lustre to b
the splendor of the scene. There were masks
of every description, from the plain black or 1
orange-colored domino to the regal robes ofr
an Emperor ; from the simple flower girl anda
gypsy to the duchess in diadem. Moorish t
slaves jostled European Kings, and demure (
nuns flirted with ferocious- looking Turkish t
Sultans. Harlequins jested with friars, and
friars promenaded arin in arm with his satan-
ic majesty. There were Cupids .with silver
wings flutting about crying 'hearts to sell,'
and a roguish Hymen enthroned upon an altar
with a burning torch in one hand and a gold-
en chain in the other, proclaiming aloud. his
willingness to bind together all who chose to
kneel at his shrine.I
-On entering this scene Emme fell behind a
step in her character as a slave ; and Geor-
giana leaning on the arm of her noble lover,
with &amp; heart full of happiness. throbbing be-
neath her jewelled vestment, walked up the
thronged hall. The height and manly figure
of Florence, the stately grace of Georgiana
combined with the dazzling splendor of their
costume and the attendant slave, soon drew
many eyes upon them, even in a crowd where
there was so much-to attract attention. Those
before them gave way involuntarily for them
as if before a royal pair, and the whisper and
remark of admiration flew from lip to lip. The
throng opened before them only to close up
behind them after they had passed and follow
in their train. Florence felt that this homage
was 'commanded by the superb beauty 'of
Georgiana alone, and he took- a pride in pass-
ing on and suffering the crowd to yield her
that homage which was her right. The beau-
tiful Emme escaped-not her share of praise;
for such modesty combined with elegance in
her air, such neatness yet r-ichness of costume,
contributed .to make her an object of at-
traction. The three so perfect and appropi-

te in. character! Who could they be ?- b'uzed
'om every mouth.
Florence, proud of the admiration she ex-
ited would lead Georgiana notwithstanding
er remonstrances the whole length of the hall,
here to his surprise, was a sort of throne,
bove which was suspended a canopy of oil-
er. Before he was aware several knights
receded by a herald pressed forward from
he throng as if by one impulse, and the Her-
Id lifting his trumpet to his mouth blew three
lasts which rose far above the loud music of
he orchestra and the sound of the dancers
eet,
' This throne is erected for the King of
Chivalry and the Queen of Beauty! Hitherto
here hath appeared none to claim it. But
ere we hail thee King of Chivalry and thee
Queen of Beauty! Ascend and occupy the
hrone !
Before Georgiana could recover from her
urprise at this simultaneous and impulsive
movement of the masked throng, a knight in
a silver casque had led her to the throne and
eated her upon it and another Kni'ght in*a
black visor had conducted and placed by -her
side the equally surprised Florence. But en-
tering into the spirit of the scene, they both
rose and graciously bowed to those around in
acknowledgment of the honor conferred upon
them, while Emme, in her character of a Cir-
cassian slave, seated herself in a graceful at.
titude upon the footstool with her hands
crossed upon her bosom.
CHAPTER VIII.
The Convent-The Padre-The Conversation
overheard by Louisette recorded-The Con-
spiracy against M. Florence Noel.
WE will now return to Don Rafael and
Benito, the cabaret keeper, whom we left cross-
in the deserted, grass-grown court of the
oil Convent towards the portal which stood
about seventy feet back from the street wall.
its gray stuccoed front, moulded with rust
and age, with its heavy cornices and massive
pilasters reared itself gloomily above their
heads as they came under the arched entrance.
This was open, as if left so night and day, foi
a common passage. In it hung An iron latnp
which shed a dull light around and served to
expose a vestibule from which ascended a
broad flight of stairs, so wide and shallow'that
one on horseback could easily have ascended
them. Opposite the foot of the stairs the head
of which was lost in perfect darkness, we6
two or three, doors and an open passage, the
extremity of which was in darkness. ' he as-
pect of all around was cheerless ; and' the
cold pavement and the damp air of the night
added to its dreary character. Save the pre-
sence of the lamp burning there were no signs

of the vast and ruinous mansion being inha-
bited.
'Whither do you conduct me, Benito?' de-
manded the young Spaniard stopping full at
the bottom of the dark stairs, upon which the
cabaretier had placed his foot in the act of as-
cending. 1I must know before I.go further.
This old nunnery may be the resort of ban-
'Do not fear, Senor,' replied Benito with a
tone outwardly respectful, but which conceal-
ed a vein of contempt. 'I told you in my
cabaret that I knew well a good Padre who
could assist you in- your matter and would
cond uct-you to him, where we could talk over
the subject without interruption. . The Padre
dwells in this convent  You mistrust me,
Don Rafael.. But so long as your gold is free-
ly given, I shall be true to you. This and not
friendship binds us together!'
'Together! Do you dare speak of me in this
union   haughtily cried the Spaniard.
This is no place nor time to quarrel about
words, Don Rafael. Will you follow me,
or shall I return to my cabaret ."
' Proceed!' answered the young man in a
brief tone.
The cabaretier mounted the broad stairs to
the second floor of the convent, and entered
upon a vestibule, from which diverged pas-
sages to different parts of the building. The
place where they stood was perfectly dark,
save a faint glimmer that reached it from the
lamp hung below.
h Father Fausto's cell is in this direction, to
the left, senor,' said Benito. 'If you will
take hold of my cloak I will guide you. The
padre rarely has visitors, and does not keep
lights in his passage; and those wro come to
see him can usually find their way in the dark.
The lamp below is lighted by the portiere at
the gate, who has several apartments under
her charge below us on the rez do c/ausee,
let out to persons for various purposes.'
'Then the convent is inhabited ?' said Don
Rafael with more confidence.
'Yes. There are two maitres d'Ecole who
occupy rooms here for their pupils in the day
time. But there is my cloak, cape to hold
by.'
'No. Lead on! Your footsteps will guide
me.
Benito moved on through the impenetrable
darkness for sorne distance, closely followed
by Don Rafael, who occasionally muttered a
deep curse as lie came in contact with the
damp wall, or struck his feet against a loose
tile. After walking a few yards they turned
an angle of the passage and entered another
much narrower, but equally dark. The cab-
aretier walked firmly and confidently on; but
Don Rafael felt his way by the sides and ad-
vanced like a man blind-folded. Benito had
got some paces before him and he heard him
rap twice sharply upon a door, and then after
a moment give a single rap. The door was
instantly opened and the lare of a light issu-
ing forth guided Don Rafae to the cell.-

'Felices . noches, Senor Padre,' said Be-
nito to a tall. thin-man in a long coarse black
gown girdled by a belt of shining black leath-
er about his waist, who had opened the door
to him. 'I have come with a friend to see you
on business. Are you engaged?'
' No, Senor,' answered the Padre in a voice,
of singular depth. 'Enter you and your
friend.'
Don Rafael followed his guide into the cell
when the Padre closed the door and pointed
each of them to a seat on low stools, himself
occupying a carved chair ofvery ancient ap-
pearance that was placed beneath' a little
book-case. On one side of him stood a rude
narrow bed of moes, and on the other a small
round stand on which was a crucifix, a metal
lamp, a rosary, and a missal much finger worn.
On the book which was open lay a pair of
iron rimmed spectacles. There were no oth-
er articles in the room save a monk's broad
hat for the street, and a penetential whip com-
posed ofseven small knotted cords.
Don Rafael seated himself, humble as the
seat was, in silence, and then fixed his eyes
steadily upon the Padre. He was a man
about fifty, with a high, stately looking fore-
head shaded with gray hair. His brows were
sharply arched and severe, and his dark gray
eyes were penetrating and stern. His nose
was high bridged and Roman, and his mouth
thin and expressive of a character proud and
avaricious. It wore, as if habitually, a covert
smile lurking in its sharp corners--a- smile
dangerous and treacherous. His complexion
was sallow, his eyes sunken beneath his
brows like dark pools beneath gloomy arch-
es; and he was without a beard The sin-
ister and cunning expression of his mouth
could not, however, destroy a certain air of in-
telligence and education which his counte-
nance manifested.
it is a chilly evening abroad, senor,' he
said speaking in the Castillian tongue and ad-
dressing Dan Rafael whom he saw closely en.
gaged scanning his countenance, and whose
attention he seemed desirous of averting; 'I
am sorry I have no fire to offer you.'
' It is of no consequence, senor Padre,' ans-
wered Valdes ; 'the air of your chamber is
agreeable, though something close.' Don Ra.
iael than glanced at Benito impatiently, as if
desirous he should make known to the father
his business. Benito, however was too devout-
ly engaged to heed the sign. He had no
sooner taken off his cloak and Sombrero than
he fell on his knees before the crucifix and tak-
ing up the Rosary began crossing himself and
telling the beads with most commendable zeal
muttering all the while prayers, which seem-
ed to ibsue from the great mouth in his enor-
mous head, as if from a cavern. The light of
the lamp shed a strong 1 ght upon his 'gigan--
tic forehead and strong features; and gave
him a look at once hideous and .awe-inspiring.
Don Rafael watched him with imuriosity. A fter
he had ceased he rose and kuelt by the Padre's
knee :                       .      .

on you, Benito, to see that I am served in this
matter."
The cabaret-keeper was for a few moments
silent and thoughtful. Don Rafael watched
his face closely. Louisette, at her listening
post in her room, trembled with fear and hor-
ror!
It is a grave affair, Dor Rafael. Besides
I know M. Noel, senior, though I have not
seen him on account of his -illnes for some
years. I bought of him the handsome mu.
latress slave Teresa who is my housekeeper,
and whom you saw in the cabaret to-night.
Hermother was a noble-looking quadroone,
almost white- and a, perfect devil for Malice.
M. Noel gave her up to the police as he sus-
peeted her, it is said of having poisoned his
wife who die4 suddenly. Yes, I well remem-
ber M. Noel. His son I have not seen?'
'He is one of the handsomest men in the

'His death would make wretched a beauti-

It is soon.'
The time is favorable. There is to be held
in the grande salon of the Hotel St. Louis,
as you know, a masquerade -of a brilliant des-
cription.  I have satisfactorily ascertained
from various squroes that M. Noel is to be
there. His costume I am ignorant of. But I
caught a glimpse of his vesture when he res-
cued the quadroone I was taking home with
me on horseback, his loak falling aside,, and
I saw an emerald sparkling on a golden breast
plate!. By this I should recognise him!'
And what use could I make of it?
You must take a mask and domino and
proceed with me to the bal masque. You see
my costume is that of an Italian cavalier.
You can keep me in sight in the Salon and
I will point out to you the emerald breast-
plate. eTh  ewels he wears, if you do your
work secretly and well, will be your own.

This was spoken freely yet in a biter trane.

to be seen wit you,' answered Don Rafael
with a look of intense disappointment.

'Cannot you lie in wait for him. Cannotyou
fall upon' him in the street!'
Benito made no reply. He sat with his
head supported on his hand in deep reflec-
tion. He seemed to have got possession of
a new view of the subject which he was at-
tentively considering. Don Rafael sat in si-
lence regarding him with eager expression
upon his countenance. At length the cab-
aretier spoke in a low, impressive voice;
'You say all your desire is to remove your
rival M. Florence Noel?',
' All. So that I may be the only suiter,
and win the object of my passion; who will
then without donbt, be true to me ! While he
is living I have no hope of success.'
You mean while she regards him with
tenderness?'
'It is the same thing.'
Not quite. For she may be brought to
scorn him.'
'How?' he demanded eagerly.
'Would that be as effectual, Don Ra-
fael? Truth is I have repugnance to blood-
shedding of late. It costs me a good deal in
penance and confession,'and I begin to feel
pious inclinations as I get older. If I ani a
monster on earth I dont mean also to be a dev-
il in hell! Perhaps we can get rid of this M.
Noel without the knife.
'In what manner? The stiletto is always
safest, Senor del Carbaret.'
' You care little about blood, Don Rafael,
so your own fingers dont get the stain upon
them. But it is one thing to pay the gold,
and another to drive the steel!'
hIt is your trade,' answered Don . Rafael
haughtily.
'Do you sayIthat word to me. Senor
Valdes?' demanded Benito fiercely. '1 am

mor-!'
'Be it thy humor then to serve this M. No-
el as I wish. Else I must find some other
palm foi my gold onzas.
I again ask you, Don Rafael,' he said im-
pressively, tif by any mea s this maiden be
brought to scorn thy rival! nay, if 'he him-t
self be so degraded and so disgraced that
you yourself, and all men may scorn and
trample on him? If hecan be so dishonored
as to fly the face of the society in which he
now mingles, will this result answer your
wishes? or must you have his life?'
'No. If you can do this that you mention,
let him live! I would rather see him degrad-
ed, so as to be ignominiously cast off by her,
than behold him lying dead at my feet.' You

' Be it so,' answered Valdes in no pleasant
hunor.
'Have you the fifty onzas of gold with you,
Don Rafael  asked Benito, extending his
thin shrivelled hand.'
' Do you take me for a voiturier, senor de
cabaret, that I muet carry such a sack of coin
with me?'         '~
' Excuse me, Senor! But, as you came
here on this especial matter, I concluded you
came provided.'
'I have but a few pesos about me.'
'I cannot divulge my plan for your success
and M. Florence Noel's ruin without the fifty
onzas in hand,' answered Benito firmly.
'Hombre maldito!' cried Valdes, rising up
and stamping, with his foot. 'Do you excite
my hopes to mock them?'
' No, Senor! This is an affair of money-a
business matter altogether. For the same
amount of money I would let M. Noel change
places with you, and plot with him against
you.'
'You are a finished malechero, Benito!'
exclaimed Valdes with angry vehemence.
' Worda move me not. Return to your ca-
sa, Don Rafael, if it please you, and bring me
the money and I will then reveal my secret.'
Valdes saw that Benito was firm; and after
biting his lips witn vexation, he said-
'If you deceive me at last, you shall not
escape my resentment. I go for the gold,
and will return in half an hour. I have to
revisit my house to dress for the masquerade.'
'Then I shall expect you and will be ready
for you. Perhaps you might as well return
in a carriage, as we shall have some distance
to go to the priest's.. I do not fear your re-
sentment. I shall succeed!'
'If you do, Benito, I shall willingly add ten
to the fifty onzas.'a
The cabaretier then let Don Rafael out of
the porte de la Rue, and securing it after him,
soon after re-entered his cabaret, as we have
already seen ; while Louisette shook her pret-
ty little head and rubbed her neat round ears,
and said with a sigh,
'Ah, what a nice secret I have missed hear-
ing, just because that evil-minded Spaniard
had'nt fifty gold onzas about him. I would
rather have given it than lost the secret.-
But I'll keep watch in the cabaret for his re-
turn, and then see what I can discover.-
With this to look after, and my Louis to keep
an eye on, who is going to-night to the mas-
querade on purpose to see some lovely girl
he fell in love with, I have enough to do.-
Ah, Louis! you dont know while you are in
the cabaret drinking wine with your friends,
that I have slipped out and got a gendarme to
secure me a ticket, and that I shall be there
too! I inust know who this pretty Creole is,
who is tempting you to run away from me to-
night, to the bal masque ! You don't know
that good Teresa here told me all about it ;
and how she heard it from her gossip, whose

mistress keeps the magazine de coutume,
where he went in and saw this pretty lady
selecting her dress, and put so many ques-
tions after she went out about her !-earned
how she was going to the masquerade in the
costume of a Circassian slave, and then or-
dered of the marc/and, the husband of the
marchande de coutume, who had a magazine
above stairs, the magnificent costume of a
Georgian prince! Ah, he does not know I
know it all so nicely! I shall be avenged
on him, the truant and false Louis!'
With this resolution Louisette followed
after Benito into the cabaret. The reader
will recollect that when Don Rafael returned
to the cabaret he came on horseback accom-
panied by his servant dressed in all points
like himself as an Italian cavalier; and that
atter speaking with Benito and assuring him
that his servant had the gold on the saddle,
lie had torn off Louisette's mask, who was
watching him with the secretintention of fol-
lowing him and Benito, and lifting her upon
his horse had borne her off.,
Before entering the convent gate with Be-
nito, on his arrival there after Louisette's res-
cue, he took the bag of gold from his servant
and silently placed it in the hands of the cab-
aretier, who, satisfied with its weight, preced-
ed him, as we have seen, into the convent,
and to the cell of the padre Fausto, where
we will once more resume our narrative.
The preceding digressive retrospection has
given the reader some idea of the character of
the priest Fausto, within whose presence Don
Rafael now found himself.
' I have heard of Don Rafael Valdes,' said
the padre, when Benito had named him; 'I
am at the service of the senor.'
' How you can be of service to me senor Pa-
dre, is more than I can tell,' answered Don
Rafael with haughty impatience; 'for I am
quite ignorant of the object for which Benito
Soto has seen fit to brlnz me hither!'
'You shall not be anj longer left in igno-
rance, Don Rafael,1 said Aenito.  A  few
words will explain to the father your position,
and then we can see how to arrange matters.'
Benito then briefly, and without the least
disguise or concealment, made the priest ac-
quainted with the state of affairs touching the
passion of Don Rafael and the rivalship of
Florence Noel, and his desire to have, him
quietly put out of the way, that he might be
the sole object of the lady's favor. Don Ra-
fael stood by listening with ,impatience, and
to do himcredit, not without a sense of shame
aud degradation, at this recapitulation by a
third party, of his own infamous and secret
designs. However, in his breast vengeance
was stronger than any other feeling. When
Benito had ended, the priest remained in the
same attitude in which he had been giving his
attention; his elbow restipig on an arm ol the
chair, and the point of his fore-finger support-
ing his chin. Both observed his countenance
closely. At length he spoke, his features ex-
pressive of a sinister pleasure:

'And you declined assassinating, Senor'
Soto,'he remarked in a doubtful tone.
Yes, Senor Padre. I have had enough of
blood,' answered the Carbaratier in a peni-
tential voice.
'And therefore you have come to me! !Do
you think I am  an assassin, hombre?' de-
manded the priest sternly.
"No, Senor Padre! I have come to see you
to avoid bloodshed. I have a plan in my
head.'
'Your head hath capacity to hold a great
many plans, Don Benito,' said the priest, his
features relaxing into a smile.
Benito smiled ; but his eyes also flashed fire.
He, however, was silent; while the Padre, as
if to mollify him; said,
'1 meant no offence, good Benito. I did
but have reference to your great wisdom and
sagacity. What is this plan?'
'When Don Rafael made known his af-
fair to me in the cabaret, a thought struck
me! The young woman Teresa, my house-
keeper, was once a slave of M. Noel the sen-
ior, of whom I purchased her. Her mother
was M. Noel's nurse for his two children,
and she was after the death of his wife, Mad.
ame Noel, surrendered by him to the PoliE
on suspicion of having poisoned her mistress
She was acquitted and afterwards came ofter
to my cabaret to see her daughter; and a
such times, I recollected, having heard he
boast that her daughter Teresa was the chili
of M. Noel.',
'It is not probable,' said the Padre wh
had listened with attention. 'M. Noel is
fair man, and your Teresa is a bright malat
ress.'
'I did not, nor do I believe it, Senor  Pa
dre. But out of this hen's egg I have hatch
ed a young serpent. It bethought me, a
Don Rafael was opening his affair to me
that all he wanted was to get M. Florence
his rival, out of the way; and that so it wer
done, it would be the same to him whether
were 4one with steel or cunning ! This h
acknowledged, when I asked him if he woul
be content with the infamy of his rival.'
'And how we're you to effect this, wise Be
nito ?' asked the priest.
'1 got my hint from Lucrece, the qua
roone mother's boast about Teresa being th
daughter of M. Noel.'
*-I dont see what connection there is here
said father Fausto.  .
'Nor, by the mass! do I,' exclaimed Do
Rafael strongly.
Benito smiled triumphantly, and then pr
ceeded in a tone of hellish exultation lookir
at each as he spoke ;_
'I said to myself in my thoughts, though
Teresa may not be the daughter of M. Noe
FLORENCE NOEL may be the son of Lueree
the quadroone!'
For a few seconds a strange silence su
ceeded the development of' this bold anda
tounding idea of the Deformed !The prie

ment and admiration at a piece of devilish in-
vention so infinitely transcending an  thing
-he, himself, with all his subtlety could frame.
Don Rafael gazed upon the speaker with a
bewildered and vacant look, as if something
vast and startling had been suggested, the
breadth and extent of which his mind had
not yet fully cokoprehended. A moment he
remained so; and then all at once the full
force of Benito's meaning flashed upon his
mind.' He sprung forward and struck his
hand into the palm of the Cabaretier, and
cried.
' Thou hast a master-spirit, good Benito
Thou shalt have thy fifty onzas made a hun-
dred, and the priest have his twenty five,
doubled, if thou succeed in carrying out this
scheme. 'Twas forrhed in hell and conceived
by Lucifer! Brave Benito, thou hast a rare
brain.'
'Did I not tell thee that my egg would hatch
a serpent.'
S '.It is a serpent that will strangle this Flo-
rence Noel if thou canst bring him within its
r folds,' said Valdes, his eyes flashing with ma-
licious triumph, as he paced with quick,
- short steps up and down the cell. 'But how
e wilt thou carry out thy plot.'
. Even so, good Benito! how wilt thou
n make this serpent bite!' asked the priest.
t   ' My plan, as you have divined, is to endea-
r vor to prove M. Florence the son of the quad-
d roone Lucrece.'
' A difficult matter to prove, Benito,' said
o the Padre shaking his head, doubtfully.
a ' Not with thy wit to help mine, good father,'
answered the cabaretier confidently' Don
Rafael hath pledged me one hundred onzas and
- yourself, fifty, if this thing succeeds. For
- this sum, which is not found under every
s loose stone, you will no doubt do your best.'
,    ' Let me first hear your project.'
, 'It is this. Lucrece must be brought into
e the secret, for without her we can do nothing.

WE will now return to ,Loise'te,: who, it
will be remembered, after her rectle by Flo-
rence from the hands of Valdes, we left on
her return towards the cabaret with Louis, who
had early made his appearance, and received
her from her respqer with many expressions
of ranly gratitude. With thiq young ,man,
we have not yet made the,.reader fullyou-
quainted. We have described Ahim as ab-ld,
handsome dissipated person, with flowing
brown locks, a fine clear eye, and an expres-
sion full of a generous frankness and open,
daring., .His person was a little undersized
but compactly knit together,:and Lhis costume
that of a sailor, with pretensions to nautical
foppery;- manifested ini his numerous finger
rings; his laced ruffles and worked linen; his
showy and, costly roach, and gold chains
flashing across his breast. - The knife which
had lai'bepide him on the table in thecabaret
was now, as lie walked by the aideof Lousi
ette, sheathed in a red silk sash that was worn
about his Waist after ,the fashion of Spanish
sailpra,, though his language and.features were
those of a' Boston-boy,ias ,such he was. He
belonged to a distinguished family, in: the
vicinity of Boston whose name is identified
With that of the earlier colonial history,, and
which gained now lustre in the war of the
revolution. His father was a wealthy ,land-
proprietPr,,. nd- Lois whom  we'-will call
Louis Wildbirdv or ,.il1 Pirata' by -which naie
he was-better known, being a lover of plea-
sure,, pursued her with such zeal that his
father after advancing several large sums to
free him.from difficulties ito which his reck-
less follies hadplaced-him, disgraced him, by
closing his door against him. , Louis wient to
sea, and made avoyagre to India,. On his return
his father-met hin and, restored him to favor.
But the youag lni's habits had not been na-
terially improved, by,'year's'life before the
mast; and, his father indulging him, in some
atonement for his pastseverity, lie soon began
a career of fashionable and expensive luxury
that brought upon him the .paternal reproof
and a threat to disinherit him. But Louis
laughed at. -he menace, and -trusting to- his
father's clemency and knowing his wealth he,
like manyoth.er heirs of rich men, expended
money as freely as'tver. At length his father
was taken sick and Louis hastened to his bed-

and gaiety of career, he was attached to hin-.

a blue cover and addressed to Louis Wildbird,

Louis was confounded as well he might be;
and for a few moments remained a statue of
silent astonishment and horror. - The old gen

'Perhaps it would be as well to examine
the blue box,' said th'e attorney who had read
the Will.
With. a faint hope that it might contain some-
thing to cancel this terrible sentence, .for he
could not believe that his father. could have
been-serious,he flew to' the secretary.' The-
blue box was there, and -addressed to him in

and lifted the lid. It contained four parcels

reached his associates; arnd after he had b een
two years in the service, the fact was thrown
up to him by .oie of the jupiot' lieutenants
with whom he had. quarreled ,Louis chal-
lenged him, and they fought outside' of the
town of Mahon where theirifrigate was sta-

ready spread tIroughoutthe ship; and though
he might. have bedn willing to return and
meet the consequpne!s of his duel he was not
willing to go back where his infamy was on
every tongue. . H e,: 'herefore, wrote ,a pplite
note tp his comsaprjg officer tendering his
resignation. -Instead of being accepted, a
sentence of dis raceful dismission from the
navy was passe upon him. Reckless and out
of employment, Louis, who had escape  infm
Mahon to Gibraltar in a Spanish coaster after
the fatal duel, associated hiuseif with aptr, y
of desperate men who had laid a pla
ing possession of a Mexican ship rich i*,4
whiqlhlay at anco up themynt ef
the ~ore. Most of these men were' pa'1
sailors though there, wereone or twolrendh-
men and an Englishman among them, Tfior-
oughly acquainted with the Spanish language
Louis attached himself to these men, wo
were twenty in number, and with thembhoard-
ed the ship, drove the crew into the water,
and robbed ,her of a large amount of specie
and gold and silver in ingots. They escaped
to the shore .in.the ship's koatsiayi  'ard-
ed her by means of a raft, and div  Ahir
booty at their rendezvous in one of the hu ts
that infest the Sneutral ground.'
Several of the robbers werearrested'; but
Louis escaped by means of a British' vessel in
which with two of his accomplices he shipped
and sailed for New Orleans. Here, instead
of expending his' gold in diesipation, fav-
ing formeda romantic idea f beig master of
his own craft on the sea, he looked about him
for a light vessel that would answer his pur-
pose. He. succeeded in falling in with a
handsome three. magted schooner Vof about
eighty tons burden, which lad recently r-
rived from Cuba withacargo of 'fruit. 'Te
amount of specie possessed by him and lii
two friends, was fourteen thousand' dollars.
They purchased the polaccal for eight thou-

cre w were principal' Spaniards ;- though he
had men of other nations, who were as in-
different for what end they were* shipped as
Louis could desire. It was during this search
after a crew that he fell in with the hand-.
some Quadroone Louisette. He was return-
ing one night to his lodgmns which were
lien, ats now, with Bienito, whom he had taken
intohis confidence and who was of great as-
sistance in getting him proper men, when as he
was passing up Rue Toulouse he was assault-
ed fromnbehind and felled insensible upon the
pavement. When he recovered his conscious-
ness he found that be was lying upon a couch

beauty.

with a smile of pleasure on seeing him sen-
sible. ' Lay still and sleep'now that you are
better and I will watch by you!'
It was with great difficulty Louis could
convince her that he wasentirely restored, and
elt no further efects from the bow he had
received, thena head, ache.- When she was
satisfied of this she began to put up to heaven
a hundred ejaculations of gratitude, and look-
ed so beautiful and bewithing that Louis
could not resist the impulse to catch her in
his arms and warmly kiss her red lips. She
escaped from him laughing; and then told
him how she had heard him groan as she was
shutting her door, and went to him and see-
ing that he was hurt had made her negro
woman help her bring him in. Louis then
looked round and saw a black female with a
red and yellow handkerchief bound on her
head seated on a cricket at the foot of the
couch. 'So we brought you in and laid you
on the couch, and did every thimg for you to
bring you to, because Ikhnew you, though

withstanding her beauty and the brightness of
her complekion, Louis knew t'o be a quadroon,
deepened the impression her charms had made
upon him. :In a word, he had been robbed of
his purse of gold outside of the house, and: he
was robbed of his hmrt on the inside. "The
first robber fled ath, 'escaped; but to this he
felt he (vould willingly sutrender himself. On
inquiring he learned that she-was just-seven-
teen, was, heart-free, and lived with a sister
who was a marchande de boucles and had her'
shop up stairs.
Louis returned to his. lonely apartment in
the cabaret, but every day he called in to pay
Madamoiselle Louisette a -visit; and finally
by means of i treaty made with her sister, the
marchande of curls, he transferred the pretty
quadroon from Rue Toulouse to his own
quarters. A few days afterwards Louis sailed
from port taking the' happy Louisette with
him. He 'cleared for Vera Ciuz in ' ballast,
having his guns in the hold. His crew con-
sisted of forty two men, most of them young
men; and a more bold and daring company
were never assembled on the deck of a vessel
under the burthen of a hundred tons. On
reaching the Balise and getting an offing,
Louis run up for the Breton Isles and there
anchoring in  secluded inlet, mounted his
carronades and long gun, and then mounting
himself upon the top of his twenty four
pounder, made the following speech to his
men:
' My lads, I have shipped you for a cruise.
Some of you no doubt think you are going to
fight the Texans. But you are very much
mistaken. I wouldn't lift a finger against the
little Republic. All of you who are of the
same mind give three cheers for the Lone
Star and take your time from me!'
About two thirds of his men joined him
with a w'll. Those who did not were Mexi-
cans; and they looked dark and frowning.
'The truth ,is, my lads,' he continued in the
same frank, smiling way in which he had be-
gan, 'I have a flag of.my own, which I ship-
ped you to sail, under; as nice a piece of
buntingas you would liketo see flying above
a quarter deck. Louisette, ma belle, hand
me that flag you have been working forme!'
The smiling Louisette who had no will nor
wish that was not identified with his, who 'in
her 'heart' she said was her true husband,
brought from the cabin and handed to him a
roll of bunting. Louis received from his first
officer, (one of his old Gibraltar friends) the
ensign halyards and skilfully bent on the flag,
yet unrolled. He then stood with the halb
yards in his hand and continued.
'Here my lads is my own flag which in a
moment 1 shall display aloft! If you dont
like it say so; and he 'who objects to sailing
under it is at libertynto go on shore, where
these fishermen will give him passage to the
Bahize pilot station. ;But those who will sail
with me shall have good; cheer, rich prizes,
and plenty to do.- Nown stand by my lads to
give it three cheers!'  '

Thus speaking he ,un up the ball of bunt-
ing'to,the mastihad. 'As, it struck the trck
it unfQlded and spread broaAly out to the
breeze, displaying to the eyes of those on
depki a pair of dice,', a' pair of spurs,' and 'a'
halter,' worked ona scarlet gogound.,
'_There lads is m  lag; mhy father'ibeqhest!
The escutcheon hblas transmitted to his son!
In a word, born to aflueaep, my father disin-
herited me because I lived too fast. He died
leaving me in his will this pair of dice, these
spurs to ride to the devil with, and this halter
to help me on my way !' .As he spoke he
displayed the articles to their eyes. .He gave
nae these to make my fortune with. I obey
him. .. There they fly emblazoned at the mast-
head and under them, I mean to acquire that
wealth of which he has unjustly robbed me'!
Now my lads, you know mne! Will you sail
with me? Let the answer je three cheers to
m   y lag'
The union of boldness, recklessness, and
good feeling in his manner, his fine frank face
which vice had not yet debased, the ingenu-
s recital of his brief history,had upon his
audience a wonderful effect,. As if by one
impulse every man but two joined in a full
swelling uzza; three for the lag,! three again
for the captain! three again! for Louisette !'
The two had refused to cheer were Ameri-
can seamen, who had no idea of compromis-
ing themselves in a free cruise. Louis after
thanking his men called these two to him, and
after questioning theta about their objections,
gave them five guineas a piece and setthem
ashore at a fisherman's hut, where it was
easy to reach the main,.
'Tell your .Captain,' said one of the tars as
the boft which landed them was putting off,
'that if we ev er su  e a free flag, we
would choose him for our captain; for he is a
true sailor and has his heart in the right place
-and he isn't perhaps so much to blame either
for hoisting for a flag all his old father left him.
Wish himfrom us a long road and merry one
before the halter brings him up!'
The men promised to do so, ankd faithfully
performed it on getting on board. Louis
smiled. He, however, did not feel that. hei
could fully assent to their moral views. He
was as conscious ais any one need be that the
nature of his father's bequest proved no ex-
cuse for his present position. But he had be-
come recklssand indifferent to consequences.
Moral feeling had been blunted in his days of
profligate eperditure, and feeling that infa-
my had followed his name, and that the life
of a fellow-being lay at his hand, he felt that
his only resource was in a life .of action and
daring achievements. He seemed to have a
sort of superstitious feeling that he would
yet come to the gallows, and be hung with the
very halter his father had bequeathed to him!
A hundred times, with this idea, he had taken
it to destroy it; but some secret feeling of de-
fiance of the worst witheld his hand. Having
put the men on shore, and go ready to sail,
he with this feeling of reckless defiance bound

The men looked on with interest gathered
around the capstanon which, hey threw the
dice. Lous got the highest.
'Put her away, before the wia4 for the la.-

Like some snow white bird of triple wing,
the light and elegant three masted schooner
went flying over the waves in the direction of
Cuba, and long before sundown, she was o1st

TE subsequent career of,' F Pir-ata de ILas

young Captain of theThree Mased Bohooper
was designated by the Mexicans, auql El
Pirata of the Riigolets, as he was knowaP in
Louisiana, from his well-known rendezypes
at a Pass so called ern Lake Borgne, we shall
but briefly allude to., He swept the gulffrom
Vera Cruz,t St Antonio, and his snae be-
came as notorious as his power and skill was
feared. , He, had been sailing under lis fee
flag of the halter but two months,, capturing
and plundering many vessels pn, the, waters
between tke.Tortugases and Cuba, plundering
them, but in no instance taking lfe, when it
became necessary to send an araped, vessel in
pursuit. With ,consummate prudence aid
seamanship united at the same time, withithe
utmost boldness and audacity, Louis evaded
the brig of war that.had been .sent to capture
him. But so persevering was his pursuer that
finally he left the waters of, uba, altogether,
and run for the Mediterranean., In this,sea
he pursued his former free ,profession, unfil
the 'Pirate of the spurs,' became the terror
of the Mediterranean seamen. After ayars
absence, and having successfully evaded q#1
attempts to capture him, and learning, that
the brig had long before been withdrawn ram
her pursuit of him, he set sailagaina for ' e
Gulf, with the intention of visiting New Qp.

both aitached and faithful, and who accom-
parnied him in all his .cruises,, JIfit assage

Pontchartrain,and so by the shores ofthe lake
to4 bayou that conducted hm withiri a league'
of the city in the -tear.
The solitary situation -of the Rigolet, its'
contiguity to New Orleans which a boat could'
itach in a few hours, by the'lake' passes and,
bayous, and its vicinity to the Gulf into which
they could run at 'any time, rendered thief
place, I the young pirate's -eyes, a suitable
rendezvous. He therefore decided on mak-
ing, it suclf'tintil he should be driven nt of
it. After remaining a few days in the city
he-returned to his schooner to which he had
given the name of 'The White Wing,' though
she was best known by the expressive title of
*Et Pirata.' This rendezvous he held for
some weeks,'oecasionally cruising out of the
lake and running down as fat-as Cuba on the1
East, and as low as Vera ,Oruz on the West.
He boarded and plundered several. vessels,
from one of which bound from New Orleans
to Europe he took a large quantity of-specie.,
The ship instead of pursuing her voyage put
back to the Balise, and the captain proceeding
to the city made known hi0 loss. The public
feeling was at once roused, and a brig of war
then lying in the stream, was instantlydes-
patched in pursuit of the bold pirate ; whileI
a party -in -boats took the inland passes for the,
purpose efguprising hird at the Rigolets should
e have put in to his rendezvous; for that this
place was the rendezous of a suspicious vessel
news had already reached the city. But there
was so many hiding places for, smugglers in
the waters about New Orleans and so many
suspicious vessels frequented them, the rumor
created very little attention. But the recent
piraciesinthe Gulf'of whih- rumor brought
information, and the story- of the 'captain at
onde inspired men- with the determination to
"'ttempt'he capture ofthe daring rover. The
desoriptiorr given of him by the captain of the'
plundered vessel, was close -enough to iden-
'tify hin with the pirate who had been in the
saie waters a year before, and 'El Pirata,'
was on every tongue.
_The description of the, pirate captain, and
thi idea -thers entertained ofhim, by no means
answered' that given by us of Louis.'
He was described by the captain as a man
wihh long, flowing black locks, a ferocious
mustache and enormous whiskers and eye-
brows, and with spurs 'on his heels; while
Louib we have represented as a young man,
with soft brown hair, a fresh rqddy counte-
natice and without beard or mustache. But
Louis had one costume for the deck of hia ves-
sel when he prepared to board a prize and an-
other face fbr the shore; and t wo persons could
flot be inore opposite in appearance than-him-
selt in the ;abiret of Benito Soto and the fierce
'looking bucamier, whoin he appeared to the
eyes of his captives. -t was to tiis-precau-
tion that he'6Wed the impunity with which we
have se~en him' appear in the streets of New
Oirlekus. The party wich went down by the
in~$d' Passes to attack his rendezvous found
itdserted.- The ruins of the fort bore every

trace of having been recently occupied, and
the ashes-of fires still remained, with frag-
ments of spars, old canvas, rusty bolts, and
other refuse of vessels.
The White Wing had-flown! She had put in
there that morning aud  nchored beneath'the
wallsof the fort; but Louis had twenty spies
who lived in'the 'city; one of whom Nicole
Roque the bojador, whom we 'hzve al-eaaiy
seen; hearing of the'intended expedition, took
his pirogue and crossing the river'sailed for a
bayou which conducted to'the lake 'by an ar-
tificial canal. He reached the 'Rigolets in
aboit nine'hours, and informed Louis of the
contemplated attack. 'In half an hour- after-
%vards the White Wing was flying down the
Lake, and when the hostile prt  arrived she
was discovered by one who climbed to the top
of the ruin, looking like a snowy gull nestling
under the horizon. But the brig was destined
to be more spccessful than the land party. The
morning following as the three masted schoon-
er was slowly movin   before a faur knot
westerly breeze through a low fog bank, and
steering south by west, along the Chandeleur
Isles, ouis who-was standing near the helm,
suddenly beheld the royals and then the -top-
gallant-dals of a large brig looming up bright-
ly into the sunlight-above the bank of mist.
She w as standing N. N. East. His 'vessel
from herpeculiar rig, and being with her
masts lower in the water had not - yet- been
seen from the brig. At a glance he saw by
her yards that she was a vessel of war. Quick-
er than thought he sprung to the helm and 'put
his vessel away. Like an arrow she darted
into the bank of dense fog to leeward and the
royals of the brig disappeared in the distance.
The brig 'the moment after crossed the foam-
ing and boiling wake of the schooner, and the
captain seeing the agitation knew that a ves.-
sel had just 'crossed 'his' track into the fog.
He instantly gave orders to put th'e 'helm up
and square away the yards;j and the next mo-
'ment the brig, which proved' to be a man-of-
war sent after the White Wing was following
in the wake.
Louis confident of having eluded the yes-
sel kept steadily on, and thanking the fog
'which had befriended~him. In about half an
hour he hauled his windanmd drew up along
the land. The brig in the meanwhile had not
seen the chase, and was only guided by the
ripple of her wake. Diut just as Louis altered
his course, the wind lifted 'the fog, and to his
surprise he saw the brig brewing up her yards
not a huridred fathomns astern' and standing
for him. In a few minutes the fog' bank
broke away, the sun shone upon the -sea, and
both vessels wcre, visible to one aryother.-
The brig threw a shot over thepirate,. and
Louis saw at once that his little clipper was
the object of her attention. He ran up his
"free flag,' returned the fire fom his 24 pound-
er, and then huged his craft' to the wind so
as to g  aet h weatther gage ofhis antagonist,
and be between him 'and the land. But we

CHAPTER XII.
The Catalier and the two 'masks!--The trial
and judgment-The Chase and Capture.
WE shall now once more take our readers
into the masquerade,following closely the steps
of El Pirata of the Spurs, ifteir Louisette had
seen him enter the mortal. Crossing the ves-
tibule at the head of the spacious stair-case,
he passed into the ante-room for robes' and
swords, and there divested himself of his long'
black domino and mask, and delivered to the
gendarme his arms, consisting of a brace of
richly mounted Greek pistols and an -Italian
dagger ; for no guest was to wear arms into,
the hall under severe penalties. He then pre-
sented his silver gilt ticket of admittance to,
the Lieutenant of gensdarmes, in attendance
at the door of the saloon, and. the next mo-
ment found himself in the midst of the noise
and splendor and gaiety within, deafened, by,
the murmur of a thousand .voices, the crash.
of instrumental music, and the tread of the
feet of a hundred dancers.
lie stood a moment ,near the door survey-
ing the scene of life and magnificence wiich
the interior of the noble saloon presented to-
his view and then, as if reflecting that but
one object brought him there, he began to,
tread the mazes of the moving througs to seek
he who had attracted him. The style of his
costume, as that of 'a Georgian Prine was
strikingly rich and elegant, and could not'fail
to attract admiration ; for there were many
parties who seemed to walk about only to a' -
mir the varied costumes of the masqueraders.
His height, though a little unirsized was
commanding, and his person' and catriage
gikaceful. His dres was a, tunic of silver
cloth,' over which was thrown a short blue silk
irntnle;;loose trowsers of embroidered mus-
lin, bocts of richly stamped Persian leather,
to which his insuperable spur were fastened;
and an azure turban studded with stars. A
jewelled breast-plate sparkled on'his bosom,
and a massive chain of gold encircted his
neck.' A crescent of rubies blazed above his
broW ! He wore a demi-vipor or half-mask of
silver wire, like a knight's visor, which, while
it exposed his fine mouth and chin'concealed
effectually the upper portion-of his features,
and at the same-time gav6 him full cotnmand
of his vision. Such was the costuMe aid ap-
pearance of Louis as he' walked' round, the
Saloon parallel with the dais in search of the
object of his admiration. He'looked 'elossly
into the alcoves which lined the' wall 'a little
raised from the floor to' give those, sated in
them a view of the dancers, and he surveyed
every female on the promenade. But there
was no Circassian slave ! There was no where
visible the exquisite figure he carried in his
eye. He traversed the circle 'of dacers ex-
aming each ohe in vinr. A group 'gathered
at the extremity of the hall, ,where seemed 'to

' He: knows. you, Emme, and loves you l'

'Our slave it-seems chooses to remain-with

to put an end to a scene evidently approach-

to suffer his sister to be longer an actor in.-
Thou wilt have to put up with our first gift,
of'half of our kingdom  ,o which'we add our
thronealso? We, therefore, do now resign it
to you!'
Thus speaking Florence taking Georgine by
the, hand conducted her from the throne close-,
ly followed by'Emme and the three- mingled
with the crowd which they had thus far con
tributed 'their part to entertain. Louis, in-
stead of ascending the throne stood and gazed
after the retiring.figure of the -beautiful Cir-.
cassian,-and then took the same way followed
by criesof,
'Success, Monseigneur Prince!'
" Thouhast fairly won the beauteous Cir-

'Bravo, hoble Prince! Tell her thou wilt
settle it with a cast of thy charmed dice!'
Not heeding .these remarks of encourage-
ment, Louis pursued them, now some dis-
tance off, guided by the crescent glittering
above the tall figure of Florence. But hilt
way was impeded by groups-tanding around
or by -parties .of promenaders 'crossing his
path and he was- soon, unable 'to distinguish
the .crescent which' guided him, among the
multitude of snowy plumes, flashing tiaras,
blazing casques, and je welled coronets. He,
ho wever, pressed on and after some- difficulty
again caught' sight of the crescent. ..The
wearer was whirling in the waltz folding in

his manly arm the princeSs. Where was tbe.

without delaying to look with-a hundred'others
upon the grace and stately bearing with which,
they moved in the' waltz, he began his search
for the Circassian, among ,those who stood
around. His efforts were unsuccessful, though
very persevering; and he had- just Made up
his mind to stand quietly- until the two had,
done waltzing at' which- time they, would
rejoin her wherever she was and thus give'
him an opportunity of-'again finding and
being. near her, when his eyes fell upon
her standing not two'yards'from hini. 'With
a half suppressed expression' of pleasure by a
sudden forward  movement he placed himself
by her side. She had evidently observed himi
for she slightly laughed as he approahed and
drew herself- backrapi'dly .retreating among
the bystanders.
Louis pursued, and after ,a lively chase'
came up with her at a place where a barrier
separated the ,dais from the dancing fior.

The French man ,doubtless had the same

., The person he had unmasked was a young
man of fortune by, the name of Tievett Brint-
nal, a Virginian Iby birth 'but a resident of
Lexington in Kentueky , in the vicinity: of
which place he had- inherited. large landed
estate.  His. money affairs had become in-
volved by a high style. of living, an d his raf-

however, insensible to what must be the ulti-
mate' result;and, indisposed. to retrench and
econiomise he. determined to rescue himself
by a wealthy alliance; in -addition to Geor-
giana -Warfield's wealth, her beauty attracted
him and' inspired him with .a sensation as
nearly akin to love as could exist in the breast
of a young man who loved only himself. Miss
Warfield, however, gave him no encourage-
ment. ,.He, however, followed her from Lex-
ington to New Orleans at the beginning of the
season, and fearing to lose her among the ad-
mirers with which she was surrounded, he,lin
a few days after her arrival, 'declared his-pas-
sion and made her the offer of his hand. She
civilly but firmly declined.the proffered honor.
He had sense enough to see .that there was no
hope for him; and began to turn his eyes in
another direction. He had already heard of-
the beautiful and rich Emme- Noel; and to-
wards her he now resolvedto direct his views.
He easily succeeded in getting an introduc-
tion to Florence, and through him to his sis-
ter.
Trevett Brintnall was -a man of.education
and address. He had the tact to render his
society pleasing; and -when he, made the ef-
fort to please, he generally succeeded in ef.
fecting his object among those, who,.having
no knowledge-of his former life, and of his
tottering fortunes,, were free from the preju-
dices which were in the outset a barrier to his
success with Miss Warfield. With such a
peize as Emme's beauty and money he had no
ordinary inceiitive to exert himself. He in
gratiated himself with Florence, from whom
he kept his true character and pecuniary con-,
dition concealed, vind soon became a daily vis-
iterat his house. Emme, young, susceptible
and warm-hearted, and placing the fullest-
confidence in one presented to "her by her
brother,suffered her heart to yield to the fas-
cinations of his address,.the devotion of his-
attentions, the apparent sincerity of his ad-
miration' At-length he formally addressed
.her and was referred by her, to Florence.-
'This wasson the very day upon the evening
of which we now meet him in the salon St.
Louis!, He had not since met;Florence, and
had deferred 'making the application to him
till the'next day.
'In the meanwhile we find him mingling in
all the gaiety of the masquerade, whither he
had come in company with, a rich and beauti,
ful Alabamian, who,' rith her mother, were at
the Hotel St. Charles; to whom he had been
also paying his~addresses as a reserve in case
the more wealthy Emme Noel should refuse
him! t'.The unmasked.quadroone, once a favo.
rite distresss, with jealous 'watchfulness quite
equal to that of Louisette, had found out and
copied the-costume of her whom she regarded
as her only rival, (for she had never yet seen
him abroad with Emme) an d hence occurre d
the scenes which have been narrated.
*But what had he to do there with the Ala-
bamian on the very evening of the day he had
been accepted by Emme!l' will ask some one

of my fair readers, who is no doubt shocked at a
the duplicity of this lover. The invitation by M
him to the Alabamian had been given someIl
days before; 'and, he was the more ready to c
fulfil his engagement with- her, inasmuch'as: c
he did not expect to meet Emme there till d
after eight o'clock, while he went there from  tI
the St. Charles with the other'lady a little" c'
after seven. -,Emme had in the afternoon h
playfully but positively refused to let him  c
know what her costume was to be, but told l
him that he must,with the instinct oflove, dis- tl
cover her. He, therefore, was willing to re- ti
venge himself a'little by letting her see him  s
with the lovely Alabamian. He had not pen- a
etrated her disguise of a Circassian when she s
sat upon the steps of the throne; nor indeed h
had she detected in the 'green 'cavalier her a
deceitful lover; for the hollow mask wholly d
changed his voice as it issued forth.  '  f
He had been afterwards seeking her in every t
female form like hers that passed him, when'
the false mask reappeared and the. scene fol- '1
lowed we, have just described. Such was the- t
character of the green cavalier-of Trevett
Brintnal!                          eII
After he had contemptuously put up the
card which Louis had given him, he was too
irritated to remain, and left the Saloon with I
the Alabhamian on his armcalled for a carriage'
and without replying to any questions put by-
her escorted her to her 'hotel. He then' re-'
turned to the Salon 'St. Louis, threwa  domino'
over his green- apparel,-got a different mask I
and once more entered the masquerade roOm,
thoroughly disguised.,, All was going on 'via t
he had left it half an 'hour before. Every- ,
where he sought for the person who had in-
sulted him, and also- for' Emme; but Louis
was too happy in the covert of the alcove in
making warm Jove to the fair Citcassian over I
ices, to have yet rejoined the crowd.   I
'At len th by accident he recognised Flor-

I Will Mondieur oblige us with the informa-
tion ? asked a Creole gentleman with impa,.
tience.
, , It has been discovered.that,.M., Florence'
and his sister are of ; quadroonre blood. That
they are the.children of a quadroone,' Lucrece,
whowas nurse in M. Noel's family. 'Madanve
Noel never: had any children; and M. Noel
has educated and passed these, off on the pub-
lic as his own. You see they-are both bru-,
piettes-'        .
'When was this extraordinary discovery
made ?' asked several persons after the first
burst of astonishment and surprise had a lit-
tle subsided ; for the announcement produced
an astounding effect upon his hearers.
'To-day.'
'It is false!'. cried a young man present..
'It will be proven in Court tomorrow,' an-
swered Valdes.
The true mother is living and claims her
children; and there is, besides a priest who
will take oath that Madame Noel confessed to
him that they were not her own children.'
'Who are you that say this ?' demanded the
young man.
I am Don Rafael Valdes.'
To attempt to describe the effect this.intel-
ligence produced upon the group.would be
vain. Under cover of the excitement he had,
raised, Valdes retired and waited theresult qf
his night's work, which he- knew would be,
made manifest when the masks should be re-
nmoved and the bal masque, according to: pre-
vious.regulations, should , be changed for the
rest of the evening, or rather of the night,
into a fancy costume ball. .,

his way as if purposely to deepen the insult
they had put upon him.
'What is this Monsieur Florence Noel?'
What is all this? I hear men saying here
and there of thee, 'he should be put outthe
salon,' 'he shoid be chastised for so longde-
ceiving the world,' 'he must have known his
infamy ?' And here I see men crossing your
path' with dark brows -f defiance. In God's
name What have you done?'
'That is more than I can answer the,
Monsieur,' said Florence with  - quick eino-
tion of'gratitude at finding oneiwfriendly tone
and look, at once recognising the fade of the
young seaman, who had' presented himself for
Louisette after he had rescued her.
'Whatever it be you have done me good
service once to night, and I will staid by
thee. -For her sake who hangs, terrified-upon
thy ann and who I am glad to meet again, I
will aid thee as I best tan !'
' Monsieur, I am grateful. My sister' has
alone prevented me from making -my own
way,' he said ; for the poor girl now required
the support of both his arms.
Louis then turned upon' the party, who
were corifrontiag'torence, having planted
themselves' ddiec'i6j-n the passage,;which
ran between a 2droiof 'colums; theft having
taken their post between two. Many others
stood round looking on with interest. Flor-
ence, Emme, Louis, were alone, as it seemed
against the-whole salon.
'Messieurs,: I pass here ' said Louis in a
calm clear tone. " He who disputes niy pas
sage risks his life!'
Don Rafael, who stood nighest, met his eye
and then stepped aside muttering an oath.-
Jules 'Moreau- stood'- firm as -if resolved t
'maintain his post. His arm was locked ii
that'of Colonel Andre's.
'I must, pass, Monsieur,''said Louis in th
same quiet tone.
'Does Monsieur intend to move?'  '
'No.'
As quick as thought the the hand of Loui
was upon the collar of the young French
man and lifting him up with as much ease a
if he had been a child, he thrbw him acros
the barrier ' into the alcove; A murmur o
astonishment and surprise followed this act o
surprising strength! - Colonel Andreaimed
blow at Louis's breast which he caughtfupo
his arm, and at-the sane instant'this gentle
man layupon the floor at hist feet.'
These bold acts, asdarig an&amp; successful
conduct always will, tutnedgwith hthe aido
certain considerations of personalisafety, th
-feeling of the crowd so muchrin his favor an
that of Florence, that the latter was tsftere
to pursue. his way towarda then door iumi

The imbecile .The'. dieppointment--The
.                n.
I- an apartment t the extremity of the
corridor on the second floor of the house into
which Florence entered, sat a gentleman in
a robe, e chambre. His head was perfectly
white.;,though his age was, not fifty. - His
countennce was a -noble wreck of former
-strength, and-intellect. The roop was sunp-
tuously furnished, and a shaded, lamp shed a
- soft light upon the crimson and musli- dra-
.pery of the windpws and couch. It was long
- past miidight, yet he sat in a deep velvet
hahked chair, hi bed untouched. On the
floor at his feet, crouched a young slave half
a sleep: and on a pallet inone-corner slept a
negro woman,-his attendants. -. He was gaz-
ing with a. vacant eye on the row of gilt rings
by which the bed curtains, were suspended
f from a rod, andcounting them incessantly in
anumbling tone of voice., Now- he would
count them forward, now backward,and give
utterancetoa low idiotic chuckle, as at each
end ofthe rod the number ofthe rings cameout
the same. t seemed as it -were, to his mind
a great.mystery that it should be so.  .
This person was the father of Florence and
Emme.. The light of his- -ind had dimmed,
- and reason no more held the reins of, his
being. His existence was animal only, .a
living body, without a souL
- e  deny. a rapid step,,a-heavy deterrnin-
ed tread, along the corridor capght,- hs -ear.
He started, stopped his counting and. listen-
ed like a timid hare. The n qgmoment the
door of his' ropm was thrown violently !open
and Florence entered bearing the lifeless
form of Emme supported on one arm, the
other still holding his sword. He stopped-
gazeda romeit ora-the affrighted - old man,
who hid his face in his rob as he. entered,
and then approaching the bed .he placed his
sister -pon-t
'Lay theie, unhappy child!'It were bet-
ter, if this fearful tale be true, that you never
come -again-to' -consciousness. He looked
tendeily upon her lovely 'ianimMate face, and
then turned away and approached his father.
- He did not atfirst speak to- him. 'He. stood
and gazed-upon' him with a -face expressive
of -bitter despair-ofhopeless despondency.
'Who-is it?' asked the old-man 'without
Suncoverig his features.
"Florence Fither,' he added taking his
hand inhis and kneeling by his side, '-will
you try and listen to me !'- -
'There are twenty-eight ring - counting

'You) have not answeed me,  and you
frightened me when you came in! I thought
it was robbers!
'Father, do you remember myniother?'
'Mother-.mother! I have no mother,' he
muttered as if impatient at being thus pressed.
'Your wife, the mother of Emme. Do'you
not reniembrher.'   -
 ' Oh, I remember I  ad a wife! Oh  es.
She was poisoned! Iremnember. But I don't

'Emme was her child.  I was her 'child,

'1 don't remember,' answered the imbecile
old man with a slow negative movement ci
his head fioin side to side.
'Po yot; not know me, iny father?. Do
you not-remember that I am your son Flo-

'Yes, I know you are Florence?7 You have

that way. -I am glaa you have come to tel

ing forward and just twenty eight counting
backwar ds ! It is very msterious !' And th
old man again directed his attentionn to th
rings and resumed his nmonotonous ceaselis
counting.
Florence rose in despair, for he had beez
.kneeling before himand paced to andl fr
the chamber, - He tried to'ilebt calmly ahn
cooly upon what had occurred. At one mo
-went he would laugh with derision' that s~
wild a tale should for a moment be regarde
eeriously; and the next, as he thought ove
the insulting scenes at the masquerade, h~
clenched is fists and vehemently "beat hi
forehead as if maddened by the .recollectori
He rejected with scorn at first the idea thi
there could eist the least fonidationifd

He bent over and- affectionately kissed.
He ihen ordered the two slaves to assist him
in restoring animation. It was already dawn'
of day when ,he revived, so deeply had her
senses beendsunk iito insensibility..
'Oh, Floieence, you are here!' were the
first words with a smile of recognition. 'I
have- been dreaming such a fearful. dream!'
'It was-'olv a.dream, sister!
'Then whj aii I here ? Why are you so
pale?'. she cried rising and gazing wildly
rounj. 'What bath happened?'
' Nothing. You have been ill. Take this'
c9miposing draught, and' sleep.' She receiv-
edit at his hands, and soon after fell into a
quiet slumber.
'There sleep, my child! May angels watch
over thee! Sleep and be strong to bear,
whAn you awake whatever evil' may be the
issue of this! I-A'ust. now go forth and. see
whence this rumor hath come. I will trace
it up to its source! I will find its starting
place, and there prove it to the world a foul
lie! 'In the. courts he said-this Valdes,
in whose Jeyes I saw sparkle malicious tri-
umphas he told tie tale. In the courts this
reorning this woman and this priest will, ap-
pear'to substantiate their claims! I too Must
be there! I iill know all-I will hear all the
damning proofs- of my dishonor, if proofs
they bring !---But let me not forget first the
claims of grattitude. I will seek the prison
andsee that this young man who defended
me so boldly be released on my security.
But off with this masquerading attire! I bet-
ter- become a- slave's tunic than a prince's
robe!' he added with bitterness.   .
He retired to his room and in a short time
aftierwards came forth in a plain citizen's
dress, enveloped in a roquelaire, ajd his hat
shading his features. . On gaining the street
he took his way in-the direction of the prison.
The sun was butjustrising and he fdlt re-
lievedat the reflection that he'should not be
likely-to encounter any one he knew. As
he passed, the botel St. Louis, his blood
rushed like lightning from his heart to ,his
brain, and he felt as if he should fall to the
ground 't was there that Georgine' abode,
an! he could see the closely drawn crimson
c-tains of the window of her apartment. It.
was the first time his own and his sister's
misery gav egm~ full time to turn his thoughts
towds her. He groaned deeply.s lIe could
nowv nceout for the abrupt manner in which
CohuliV9arfield had' ta n her from' his
arm. Opuld sheet too, believe this' strange
and' reproable tae. And why unprobalble?
he asked himself. Have not such tings be-

fore happened? 'Tis not three months since
a young imerhant shot himself, on discover-
'ing hiniself'to be a quadroone! If this prove
true, Emme and I had better both die! Im-
probable it will not be regarded in a city
where such' things have before occurred;
and, for that reason, this tale is more easily be-
lieved! But can she believe it ? That note*'
I now believe had reference to this tale;:per-
haps informed her of the rumor. She Mtore it
up with indignation! If the paper referred to
it, she believed not the report. . This idea,
sustains me! Yet I may not approach her to
confirm it! I will not see her 'until I have
proved it false!'
With a spirit that rose in resolution and
strength, with the idea of Georgine's favor,
he moved onward towards the prison. Re
soon reached its glootny precincts, and caie
to the main entrance. The turnkey at first
refused to admit him; but a piece of gold re-
moved his objections. The heavy. iron gate
ofthe lobby was unchained, and. unlocked
and opened by him, and an assistant was sent
with him through the passages of the prison
to conduct him to Louis. .'After opening
another gate, composed ofa strong "lattice of
iron barascovered, with sheet iron, Florence
found himself in a vast apartment of the pris-
on, gloomy and revolting in its features. It-
was the common prison-room of the Cala-
boose, and capable of accomodating a hun-
dred prisoners, half of which number, ofevery
shade of complexion, and seemingly of every
nation, were now there locked up, as he en-
tered. Some were piled in a dark corner still
asleep: others were eating their coarse break--
fasts; others pacing up and down gloomily.
Some ofthin seemed reckless, some sad;
some were silent, and others noisy. All were
more or less wild and savage looking; and
not a few had stamped upon' their ferocious
visage, the deep impression ofvillany. Many
voices were confusedly mingled together in
half a dozen tongues and there prevailed a
disorderly confusion anda savageindepend-
ence of all control. Near the door on the
inside a gezdaee with a musket at his shoul-
der walked up and down. To him Florence
made known his business.
'If you want to see the young man in
masquerade costume who was brought in at
two o'clock this morning, you will find him,
there asleep!'
Florence crossed the stone floor to the op-
posite side of the prison and saw the person
he came to se gnietly sleeping wrapped in
the domino M1Idg'orn to the salon over his
rich, costume'. ;Hegazed a moment on his

VOS1CLU5MOM,
Taz morning following these events, the i
city was thrown int 'theW eatestexcitemeit
by the rumor that the piratieal schone- I
'The White Wing,' whjph'had been captur- w
ed a few days before anxd'lay alongside of the T
brig of war in the stream, had disappeared in ra
the night, no one knew whither! She was ai
not missed until day light, when the intelli- n
gence flew like wild-fire through the town.- w
To lhis was soon added another report equal- ol
ly startling; that Florence Noel had escaped lc
from prison ! Soon after came the intelligence P
that Benito Soto had disappeared leaving his a
cabard wide open all night !-then followed b,
the rumor that the quadroon Lucrece had left ei
her home the evening before with a stranger m
on business and had not been since heard w
from. Finally, to crown all, it was discover- i
ed by some suspicious persons who went to c
see, that the padre Fausto had disappeared
from his cell in the old convent !
The brig of war got underweigh in -pur-
suit of the schooner; and the town was rife
with a hundred various rumors and surmises.
To Florence was given the credit of running I
away with the schooner, after first murdering
the quadroon and the padre!
If we had room, we should be glad to fol- I
low in detail all these events. But as we must(
draw our chapter and story to a close, we canI
only say brieny, that Louis, the "Pirate of:I
The Spurs,' was the prime mover in all-these:
several'disappearances! That having assem-I
bled and instructed his men in the evening,I
he had succeeded in severally getting into his.
power Benito, the Padre, and the Quadroon
Lucrece, who, each one alone were decoyedI
by stratagem to the little vessel of Roque the
bojador and safely confined under the forward
deck. .That then Louis by heavy bribes got
admission to Florence's cell and prevailed
upon him to consent to escape, overruling his
objections, and showing him how, thereby,
he could prove to the world his legitimacy.-
He then by a large bribe prevailed on he'
gendarme who was guard over him, and who
proved to be our old acquaintance Jerome Ja'
cot, tojescape with him. The three-left the
prison without any obstacle, Jerome having
furnished Florence with a complete suit of
the gensdarmee' uniform. Before goingto the
little vessel of the bojador, Florence stepped
to see Emme. He would have pursuaded her
to escape with him ; but she plead the filial
'duty owed to their father. Florence admitted
the justice of this .duty ; and assuring her
that the whole story (as Louis had explained
to him) was a plot of Don Rafael's the priest
