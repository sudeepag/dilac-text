Leaving port.- Captain Tom Wood an the Mate.--View of Oldbury from the mouth of the river. THE brig Maud MAuller was lying at the wharf, ready for her long voyage to Calcutta. The cargo was all on board, but the decks pre- sented the confused appearance which is always incident to the departure of a ves- sel. She never wears the appearance of a house in order till she is out of green water and fairly at sea.   6     CAPTAIN JOIIN; OR, The Maud Muller had been launched from Currier's ship-yard only a few weeks before the morning of which I now write.  The world in which she was to live and move was as unknown to her as is that of the human soul, when she is sent forth to sail in unknown seas, to wrestle with storms, or test her soundness under the more trying ordeal of sunny skies. It is the tropical heat that proves the seasoning of the ship's timber; that makes yawning seams or un-. sightly cracks; and it is in sluggish waters and sunny calms that the barnacles and sea worms gather on her coppered sides. This brig was a beautiful model, trim and staunch from mainmast to keel. Captain Tom Wood was proud of her as he trod the deck on that fine June morning. We that live by the sea are so accustomed to personify vessels, to think and speak of them as living, sentient beings, that we for-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    7 get sometimes that it is only timber, cordage and sail-cloth, iron, glass, and copper, that, in the hands of skilful workmen, have been wrought into this thing of beauty. There seemed to be a mutual understand- ing between Captain Tom and his brig." He was as'proud of her as a bridegroom of his bride when they go from the altar, hand in hand, to share the better or the worse of life. The crew had been on board from early morning, and were busy stowing away the cargo, while a crowd waited on the wharf to see the departure of the vessel; and a num- ber of sailboats with slackened sails hovered near, ready to accompany her a little way out of port. There was the "Lottie C-," a "nicely- painted boat," with a retired sea captain in the stern, who never saw a fine vessel leave port but he bade hw "God speed!" and h:" "God p an d  - '    8     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, watched her progress till she had made the open sea. There was the "Sea Bird," a bonny boat, owned and sailed by the young minister, who loved the water with an apos- tolic love strong as that of John or Peter when they lived upon Gennesaret.  The "Gypsy" followed. She was a queer little boat, with square sails, and odd in shape. She made as good time, though with less grace than the others. She reminded one of a rough Shetland pony good for a trot, but would not enter the lists with the Har- vard or Oxford yachts for the prizef swift- ness or as a model of beauty. The day was fine.  A soft west wind, a blue sky above, with only a few teecy clouds,-the fairy craft that sail the upper seas, -were to be seen in the horizon. It was a pleasant scene on the Merrimac that day; the boats were filled with young peo- ple of both sexes in mala costume. Up tho   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    9 river a few miles was the home of the poet whose beautiful creation had suggtested the brig's name. Along the banks the land was in bloom, and the beauty and greenness of spring rested on the landscape around the quiet, old town of Oldbury. Captain Tom was a hale, vigorous man, not yet thirty years of age. He was scarcely medium height, was squarely built, erect, with a broadl chest, and a head that was set- firm and strong on a somewhat short neck. This head was well shaped, and covered with thick, curly, dark hair. The forehead was broad rather than high, the face somewhat square, but with a full, rounded chin. The mouth expressed reat firmness. The sailor who understood that mouth inew very well that when the captain laid down the law he would enforce it. The eyes were large, dark, and brilliant; they were eyes that flashed sometimes with anger, but filled 6+ tf rJ "   .*,   10     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, with tears at a mother's parting blessing. The captain gave orders to loose the an- chor, and the brig, with her new, white sails to the breeze, sailed gracefully out of port, with the gay sailboats, like the train of white-clad bridesmaids at a bridal, flut- tered at her side. Captain Tom stood-upon deck, with his eyes fixed upon a certain point on shore. One person only noticed the fix- edness of his gaze, and he( as if he saw not. To explain this point of interest we must give a brief description of the town as seen from the- water. The land rises gradually from the river for half a mile, and is crowned by a ridge, onl which is one of the most beautiful streets to be found in the world. In it one may walk five miles and be shaded by venerable elms, that much of the way twine their boughs with loving fellowship. On the upper side of the ridge ale houses built many years ago, in the old   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.     " English style, and well built, with solid tim- ber and ample space- "Those noble homes our fathers reared, Ere primal forests scarce were cleared; When beams and rafters measured long, And hearts were brave and arns were strong; Their firm foundations stoutly stood, Through winter storms and spring-tide flood." One of these houses is noticeable for an observatory of modern construction, from which can be seen the harbor, the islands at the mouth of the river, and the broad ocean beyond.  It was to this point the captain's eyes were  directed; and when the observatory itself became a mere speck in the distance, he took out his glass and caught once more the flutter of a white dress and the outline of a female form. This vanished at last, and then the cap- tain's eyes lingered long and lovingly on the   ' receding town.  One by one the spires of the churches became invisible, the last to  * '^^   12     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, disappear being the Old Town church, as it is also the first to greet the incoming vessel. Then Pipe Stace Hill, and the long, sandy island that stretches like a treacherous ser- pent its yellow folds across the chlannel of the river, and sometimes swallowing the un- wary vessel who ventures too near the' coast in a storm. The captain seemed riveted to the spot, till nothing was left for himt to gaze upon save the sky above and the sea beneath him. Then, as if just roused from a dream, he turned to his mate, who had been busy on deck. This was the man who had watched the captain as if not seeing him. ^ "John! John Grant!" said Captain Tom, laying his hand familiarly upon the shoulder of the mate ; "that is a beautiful old town that home of ours. I could fight for her, die for 'her if need be. I love the very stones of her streets. Two years-two  .   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   13 long years will pass before we see her again; 'but I have taken a look that will last me a long time.  I canl shut my eyes and see every street and hill, almost every house and tree, even the faces of those who go about the streets. I feel as if the whole place were daguerreotyped on my brain." "Ay, ay, sir!" said the mate, as he moved a little aside from the captain. "Jack, reef that sail!" "There is a stiff breeze springing tp, captain." "John Grant!" said the captain,  what is the matter with you?  Are you fiozen over  Is it John  Grant or somebody else?" "John Grant, at your service, sir," said. the mate, slightly touching his hat, giving a significant look at a knot of sailors who were busy at a short distance from them. , "Yes, yes! I understand.   'Discipline f..           "    CAPTAIN JOIIN; OR, must be preserved.' Wait till supper time, when I shall have a few words to say." With this sentence, the captain shook off the reverie in which he had been indulging, contrary to his usual habits on shipboard. A I should not have said anything about'the old home to John," he muttered to himself, as he walked to the forward deck. "Just like one of my blunders!  He is in the right, too, about respect to me; understands himself well. If that fellow is a--stop, Tom Wood; don't you even think the word!" The mate, John Grant, was at this time about twenty-one years of age, measuring no more inches in height than the captain but, being more slender and closely knit, looked taller. tIis features were not regular, and there was nothing in his first appearance that- would particularly interest a stranger. His manner was grave and quiett,and he had a pair of clear, gray eyes, which, when he   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   15 spoke, looked directly at the person ad- dressed, and gave to those who talked with him an impression of great truthfulness. His. movements were slow, but direct, and his manner decided, as of one who had an object I in view, and knew the most direct road to it. This firmness of character was useful to him on that day; for when the crew of the Maud Muller found who was to be their second officer, tlney gathered themselves to- gether and made significant gestures. For a few moments there was danger of rebel- lion. If Captain Tom had seen this move- ment, there would have been such an explo- sion of his wrath as would have cleared the atmosphere like a sharp tiunder-storm. Fortunately he did not know it; and John Grant was left to settle the matter in his own way, which he did by caliing the leader, Jack Buntin, to his side.  "Jack," he said,   16     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "I am second officer of this vessel, and I mean to do my duty, and shall see to it that every sailor does the same or suffers the consequences. A man who can sublmit to stern discipline knows how to enforce it.'- Jack Buntin quailed beneath the gaze of those clear gray eyes, that seemed to look into his heart and read what had been paScing there that day. Then the slow, decided way of speakinl, as if each word were weighed, so unlike the quick, impulsive captain, cwho was roused to passion by the least dereliction of duty, made Jack feel that, without the captain's passion, the mate had ten times his firmness. Jack was born and raised in Oldbury, in the same street with John Grant. His father was a poor, miserable drunkard, who had long since gone down to a dishonored grave. Many a time, when a little boy, had John Grant brought food and clothing to the   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    17 wretched family; and, more than once, the poor mother and children had found, refuge -in Grant's house from the cruelty of the father. All this Jack remembered; b)ut that   t had happened since which made him   say, "Tables are turned now! Jack Buntin call hold his head hgher than old, rich Grant's son!" He was not inclined to say it again after this interview, but whked back to the fore- castle, and said to the sailors,-- "Look here, boys,! 'tisn't no use. Best give in awhile, leastways, while we are on shipboard.  There's a devil in the mate's. eye (Jack's word for power); and it will be safest to walk straight till this cruise is over. Once on shore again, we'll teach John Grant a lesson. Mum is the word', boys, till then, or ye'll catch it!" Jack's word was law; and the sailors went about their work, each with an extra quid of 2   18     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, tobacco- in his mouth, muttering curses deep but not loud. John Grant was busy until the supper hour. It was evident that he knew his duty, and could handle the brig - a fact which aston- ished Jack Builtin, and increased his respect for the mate. The crew looked at the grave, staid man, whose eyes penetrated every part of the vessel, and whllose words were few but well chosen, with looks in which surprise and awe were blended.   When he catme on board, not a man amongrthem but was ready to revolt at his authority; and it was only through fear of the captain that there was not a revolt. But at nihllt they all responded heartily to Jack Buntiu's remark: - There's real grit in him, anyhow;, but he needn't drop his words as if they were doubloons. Guess, though, he hasn't said much, of late." "Acts as if he had been to meetin' .a good deal lately," said another, at which they all Y,    ,a nohr    tw   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    19 laughed, while Jim Myers said, "Guess as how he haint been to dancin' school lately either." Meantime the subject of their re- nmarks had gone to the captain's, cabin. The latter was writingl in his dressing gown and slippers. Supper was on the table. "Halloo, John I I hope you are ready for rest and food now.  I thought best to let you work through alone, and not interfere. But very little has escaped my eyes since we crossed the bar. I have seen every turn of Jack Buntin's eye, and I knew what those fellows were ready for when you came aboard.  I had hard work to keep my temper down, aldcl could have thrown a marlins pike at Jack with a good Nwill; but I know you, old fellow, and I was sure you would show your mettle, and have every mother's son of them under your thumb be- fore night. They know their master now, 1do they not?"   O     CCAPAIN JOHN; OR, "I think so, Tom; at least, I mean they shall before I have done with them. As he spoke his face was pale, and there were weary lines upon it, while the m us- cles of the mouth relaxed like one who had ceased from a great strugglcr ; and the voice had lost the clear, ringing tone which had made such an impression upon the crcw. The captain noticed it, and, flinging his pen down, rose from his seat with a gest- ure which was understood by the mate, for the next instant, the weary head of the youngcer man rested, upon the broad, chest of the captain, and tears fell from thosee clear, grLay eyes that were not used to weeping. "Tom, Tom, do you know what you are to me? Your love is the richest boon of my life. God bless you, Tom. I mean to do my duty till death, as a man shouldl trust- ing in that God which my mother taught me X              t 1    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    21 to. love; but, Tom, your friendship makes : life bright and -duty a pleasure.;" "John, old fellow, do you know I feel like a miserable, craven fellow beside you? I have long since put your name ill the catalogue of those about whom my mother used to read,-t-'of whom  the world was not worthy.' I am no Christian, as you well know, and have lost faith in that over- ruling Providence that the ministers preach about. Don't look so solemn, John; it is the fact; I do not believe in it ,at all. If God governs the world, why does he let the good suffer and the wicked prosper in their ,wickedness? Is that the way I would do if I were governor?" "Well, really," said John, "much as I     , love you, Tom, I would hardly trust you to govern the world." "Laugh on, John; I will preach a sermon if it will bring that old boy-look back to   22     CAPTAIN JOHN; or, your face. But I see crooked places enough that need straightening; and if I could see through all space and into the hearts of men, wouldn't I mete out justice with a strong hand? But you must be tired and hungry; supper will cool while we are talking; come on, this coffee will brighten you." The mate needed the food, for he had hardly thought of eating since morning. No one but God knew what John 'Grant had suffered that day, or how many times he had said to himself, "Courage, John Grant! do your duty; be brave; let no man despise you, but stand erect- under the burden which God has given you to bear." Strength had been given him that day to win respect from the crew; and, as for the "Whittier," he felt that with their aid he could manage her as easily as if every bolt and spar were the work of his own hands. At the same time, he would have laid down   "OSS IS SOIE:TIMES GAIN.    23 his life to save the meanest sailor on board from death or sufferinrg. T ose rough, un- taught men little knew the stuff of which I he was made. They began to have some glim- mering consciousness that they had not un- derstood him. By and by they will appre- hend- that there are heights and depths in his character utterly beyond their power to measure. It was midnight.  The moon was rising from her ocean bed, beautiful as Venus when she first parted the wave. The sea was tran- quil, with just a light breeze that carried the vessel onward, while she was far enou-Ah now from the coast to need less watchfulness than when first leaving Oldbury. The tired sail- ors were asleep, save the watch and the man at the wheel.        i The captain had finishe   his supper, smoked his cigar, chatted awhile with the mate, written a few lines in his journal, and,   24     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, after a walk on deck, where the sight of the well-ordered brieg led him to say, "John Grant, she is a beauty; I am proud of her," he turned into his berth and fell asleep as soon as his hecad touched the pillow. rNot so with the mlate. He had written ,for a short time, and then read that beautifill psalm:--"In thee, O   Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion. "Deliver me in thy   righteoousness, and cause me to escape; incline thine ear unto me, and saveme. "Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort .  . . for thou art my rock and my fortress." As  he read, there came into his heart a peace which gave rest to his wearied body, and swept from his face the trace of care. He went up on deck, and looked up to the "ocean spread on high," and down upon that beneath his feet, through which- the vessel   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    25 moved, parting the yielding waters with her prow, which answered to her touch by the rippling music on the keel.  John Grant threw his arms upward alld forward, and trod the deck like one. who feels the joy of free- dom and the glory of sea and sky.   The malll at the wheel saw him, and muttered to himself, "Likes it, does he? No wonder!" The watch saw him, and turned noiselessly, away; for there was' something in the atti- tude and expression'of the face, as the moon- lilght fell upon it, that made him think, as he afterwards said, of " a picter in his mother's big, Bible, of Moses on a mountain."  It was nearly morningr when John Grant soulght his bed; and yet, when he met the Captain at breakfast, he looked as fiesh as if he had slept as many hours as usual. "Well, John," said the captain, "I dreamed of Oldbury last night, and I saw, in my dream, every church, and house and tree.   26     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Do you remember the old elm   near the green? I could sketch any limb of it and also the tree ill State street to which General Washington fLastened his horse." "And canl you sketch a -certtain cupola, from which fluttered something white, like a flag of truce, as we sailed out of port;?" "Ay, John! I thought you were so ab- sorbed in the beauty of Jack Buntin's face that you did not heed the white lady. Yes; Stella was there-the star' of my destiny-! One voyage molre, John, and then comes my marriage. Two years seems a long while to friends at home who wait Our coming; but we who love the sea never seem to be wait- ing, like landsmen. Why is it, I wonder? Every ship's length we make seems to bear me onward to happiness and a home." John Grant smiled as he looked at the captain's face, on which neither time nor trouble had traced one furrow a face that   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    27 was the indclex of a happy temper, and told the truth; for, though he " carried anger as the flint carries fire," his disposition was sweet and sound to the core. HHe had been a favorite among the schoolboys at Oldbury. Ice was a leader in all their sports, and -Wias very shrewd in gettincg them out of mischief, as well as foind of leading them into it. The secret of this was, his fearlesslness in telling the truth. He never skulked away, or threw the blame upon others.  The boys always strove to see which side could get him in a game of ball, and chose him for a leader in all their fishing and nutting excursions; but when it came to rivalry in studies, poor Tom fell behind. They preferred Jlis sister Clara when choosing sides in spelling; for Tom was invariably as generous with the letters of the alphabet as he was of his coppers and candy, as one specimen will show.   The word "'negro had been misspelled one day,   28     GAPTA'INI JOHN; OR, and was finally tossed over to Tom, upon whom the class depended to save their crecdit for the day. Tom, then a short, sturdy little fellow, the epitome of an alderman, stood very erect, and gave the boys to understand that he was fully up to the occasion, and delighted with the chance of winning a vic- tory for them. The boys, seeing the wprd was so easy, were glad that it came to him. "Well, Tom," said -the teacher, as the little fellow stood out from the line, in his eager- ness, with one hand up. It was not often that he could spell a hard word; but he was confident of his ability now. "Well, Tom; one trial more to-day, and you-shall have the chance." Tom's manncr was very triumphant, and his voice like a boatswain's, as he began- "tn-e, ne- g-e-r, ger - e-r, er - r-o, ro - negererro!" and Tom stood black, proud of Illis exploit.   "OSS IS SOM3ETIM3ES GAIN.   29 The shout of laughter from the boys, and the curious smile about the teacher's mouth, puzzled Tom for a moment; but when he saw the hands up, and heard the boys,- "One more trial, please, sir!"-the fact slowly dawmned upon him that he had not won the victory. Poor Tom! He felt sorry, not for himself, but that his side should lose through his ignorance. But when there was boating on the river, it was Tom's strong arms that could manage the oar, and Tom's knowledge of islets and shoals that made them feel safe, - and Tom's chowders that were better than anly other boy could make. 'Tom was not a model boy. He was often in trouble. It was such hard workl to study, and such easy work to -help the little boys make their whistles, and fiashion and rig the mimic vessels that went to sea on Frocr Pond; and it was so delightful to play puz- zle on the slate with, one of the girls, that P    30 -    - CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Tom was often kept after sclhool to make up for his neglect of lessons. He always took his punishment in a matter-of-fact way, with no resentment at (all, and- would study like a good fellow, to atone for his idleness; but, alas! he would be just as idle the next day, or rather just- as busy, for he was never quiet. The teacher came, at last, to punish him less. "I don't know what to do with the boy," he said; "there seems to be lno malice in him, only an, unaccountable forget- fulness of self," which, aftcer all, was a badlc thing for a scholar and needed correction. But Tom had a violent temper, thourgh the teacher, having good command of his own, saw little of Tom's in the schoolroom. The boys knew it well however, as the following incident will show. There were, on the girls' side of the house, two children from the- extremessof Oldbury Society. Stella Drummond was a-   "OSS .IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    31 beautiful little Hebe, to whom fortune had given her choicest gifts; she was all-ldimples and sunshine.  Her father, 'Squire Drum- mond, as he was called by courtesy, had retired early in life from a successful busi- ness career, and lived in one of thosV beau- tifill homes on the ricdge. He was beloved by all who knew him; a quiet sort of man, who never interfered with the affairs of his neighbors, but was public-spirited and gen- erous. His wife was a quiet, refined little woman, sympathizingc in all her husband's tastes, especially' her love of flowers. Their garden was a delightful place of resort. - Trees and shrubs seemed glad to find homes there; and fruits were almost tropical in their growth and beauty, so care- fully tended as they were in hot-houses and conservatory. -Stella was their only child, the fairest of all the flowers of the garden. One winter's   32    - CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, day, when the snow was compact and hard, and coasting the amusement of the boys, Stella Drummond asked her cousin, Ned Ford, if he would lend her his sled. Now, Ned was a coarse, ungainly fellow, a petty tyrant- in his way among the scholars, and, like all tyrants of large or small growth, very selfish. 'But he never denied his Cousin Stella any favor; partly, perhaps, because he was dependent upon her father for sup- port, and, to do the fellow justice, he loved his cousinl as much as his' coarse nature per- mitted him to love anythinr outside of self. Stella was running for the sled when she saw Betsey Brown limping down hill. "Come, Betsey," she said, "I am goinog- to slide down hill on Cousin Ned's coaster. Don't you want to come with me?  , The girl stopped, loolaked pleased, but added, - "I haven't any sled, Stella."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    33 "You may take Ned's, and I will get Tom Woods'. Tom don't fly into a fury, like the other boys, when the girls run off with his sled." "I guess he wont if you have it, Stella," said Betsey. "Why, Betsey! he never gets mad with the girls."  "But he has an awful temper when the boys vex him." "Never you mind about that, Betsey Brown; jump on.   Can you steer?" "Yes, I guess so," said Betsey, wrapping her old cloakl about her, and gathering her- self together on Ned's sled-a large, red sled with "Tiger" painted on its side. Betsey was a little, thin, sallow girl, one of the town's poor, whose only home was the workhouse. She wore a queer old dingy plaid cloak, and an antiquated stuffed hood made of faded red bombaset, - one of those 8   34     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, head-gears that deform the prettiest face, and which made the thin, sallow visage of Betsey look like that of a wizened old woman. The shoes were large, ungainly things, made by cobbler Dunn; for, as he could only do poor work, the town employed him to shoe their poor. The child had al- most died from a troublesome humor which had, after a long struggle, made a compro- mise, and allowed the poor victim to in- herited disease, to limp slowly to the grave, instead of sending her there with the swift tread of -fever. Nature is not often so nig- gardly of her favors as she had been to poor Betsey, for her intellect shared the inheri- tance of poverty. She could not get beyond the threes in the multiplication table; and, as for grammar, the brain utterly refused to bear the weight of nine parts of speech, with syntax and prosody on the top. But Betsey could slide   \ LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    35 down hill, and steer a sled when there were no obstructions; and the tawo girls had made one descent, and dragged their sleds up hill, ready for another, before they were noticed by the other scholars. Betsey had seated herself again, and Stella had tucked the thin, worn cloak around her, and lent the girl one of her own little white mittens with scarlet tassels, when the boys came running toward them. Stella was a pretty picture as she stood there on the snow, in her bright plaid dress and jaunty cap, with a bird of paradise, in its golden plumage, peeping over the brim to look into her bright eyes. Her feet were clad in -thick-soled, neatly fitting Polish boots, with scarlet tassels. There was a rich glow on her round cheeks as she stood there ready to mount her sled, with her red lips puckered up, ready to say, "One to   36     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, make ready, two to prepare, three to slide down hill, straight down there!" These two children were, as I have said, at the two extremes of Oldbury society; but what cared they for all the distinctions of society, as- long as they could coast down hill on the boys' sleds that sunny winter's day? Stella had just' seated herself, when Ned Ford came along, and, seeing Betsey Brown on his sled, gave her a kick: with his heavy boot, which sent her some distance from the sled, against the trunk of a large tree, say- ing, as he did so,- "I'll teach you to take my sled, you pauper, you!" Tom Wood had seen the whole proceeding, but not in time to prevent it. His large eyes flashed; the color mounted to the roots of his hair. He rushed upon Ned with a suddenness and fury that laid him prostrate, and then pommelled him with his sturdy fists. *^   "OSS IS SOMETIME  GIN.   37 Ned was the elder and stronger of the two, and managaed to struggle to his feet, ready for revenge, when he was blinded by a huge snowhall, sent by Stella straight between his eyes. The boys now came running to the spot, shouting, "Hurrah for Tom Wood!" "Give it to him, Tom!" "Lick him well, Tom!"And, while they shouted, a shower of snowhalls, aimed at Ned, prevented him from seeing his antagonist, but did not pre- vent the, latter from obeying the boys, to "Iick him well," saying, as he did so, - "I'm teachingr ye manners, you rascal!" Meanwhile, Betsey, who had little strength of body to endure pain, or mental power to sustain her in trouble, was crying at the foot of the tree. Tom brought his sled to the tree, and put her on it; then drove some stakes in the four corners, for the trembling girl to cling to, and drew her home, followed by two or three of the boys. Stella watched   38     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,           I them till they had turned the corner of Eed- eral Street, and thein, with one little mitten- less hand, ran homeward. There was much surprise among the schol- ars, and some pleasure too,-for Ned was no favorite,-at this outhurst of passion from Tom; and. they came to school the next day, prepared to make a hero of him. Betsey Brownll went to sleep that night only to dream of Tom; and in the morning, she dived to the bottom of her little trunk, and brought out a tiny pill-box, in which was a silver ten-cent piece -her only treasure- to carry to --Tom. But Tom was so much like his former self, and so utterly uncon- scious of having done anytlhing heroic at all, that the scholars were in doubt how to honor him. As for Betsey, poor child, she waited in vain for one loolk or word from him. He had, apparently, forgotten her existence and all day long she kept it in her pocket,   every now and then grasping it with her hand, but not daring to offer it to Tom. At last, when they were going out of school, the boys having gone first, she found Tom waiting outside with his sled. She ventured then to take out the pill-box, and say, - "Tom, please take it." "What is it?" said he. "Pills, Betsey? I don't like 'em." She opened it, and showed him the ten- cent piece., "And what for do I want that?"  Tom didn't like grammar any better than Betsey. " Don't you know, Tom - last night?" "'Oh, nonsense! Runalong, childl I had my pay out of Ned." At this moment Stella came out, like a canary springingr from its cage. "Will you ride home on my sled?"Tom asked; and Betsey limped away to the workhouse. Poor child! It was divine compassion that could   40     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, appreciate the devotion which brought the alabaster box to anoint the feet, and so much more divine than human, in that it would accept the gift. Tom was not destined to be the hero of the school, after all; for, to be this, a boy must maintain a good standing in his class; and Tom would make blunders, in spite of all his good intentions to avoid them. That very day, in his reading class, he read as follows: [The lesson was a chapter on Polit- ical Economy.] "The instruction for savages in our commonwealth will be of great benefit to day laborers and mechanics." "Stop, Tom!" said the teacher.' "Go back and read that over." Meanwhile the whole class were nudging each other, and laughing. "Spell the first words, Tom," added the teacher. Tom   obeyed, and read slowly, without   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    41 being conscious either of the laughter of the class or the ludicrousness of his mistake: "The institutions for savings in this com- monwealth," etc. Tom could sail boats and coast with the bravest; but/ when studying arithmetic, he rubbed his head till his hair stood up as if a galvanic battery was at work upon it. When- ever he got beyond his depth, however, there was one boy who always stood ready to help him out. This was John Grant -two years younger than Tom, but his chosen friend; and as he is prominent in our story, we will describe him in the following chapter,   CHAPTER II. 'Squire Grant and his home, the -"Robbin's Nest. -Mrs. Grant.- Grandfather Fletcher.-- Emily Mills. --John Grant. AS honest as Joe Grant," was a common saying in Oldbury; and "as regular as the sun," they might have added, for he never failed to make his appearance in the old Merrimac Bank precisely at nine o'clock A M., in summer and winter, in sunshine and tem- pest, and always went to his dinner at one precisely, just as the sexton of the centre church was ringing the bell. If the town clock failed, 'Squire Grant did not. For forty years he was never absent from his post on a regular bank day. One half of this (42)   "OSS IS SOIETIMES GAIN.   43 timne he was cashier, and the remainder pres- ident; but the latter office did not prevent his presence at the bank daily. Next to his home, he loved the bank. It had prospered under his management, though he was- of the old school, cautious and sturdily opposed to large percentage. When younger men found fault with his investments, and wished to make money faster, he shook his head, and said, "Money is only worth about so much in the long run, sir, and I am managing this institution for the long run." He was a quiet, grave man, slender, a little above the medium height, very neat in his person, and somewhat precise in his manner. His home was about a half mile from the bank,. He always walked, never varying to the other side of the street, or going across corners, as he might easily have done, The old tall clock in the hall of his house hept time with his chronometer watch.   "    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, -They were introduced to each other when the former was about fifty years of 'age, and the latter fresh from the importers' hands. The clock, in all the dignity of antique, carved mahogany, wearing the moon upon its brow, and counting the days of the month while it ticked, with a grave accent, the seconds of time, looked down upon the tiny toy which the master held in his hand not with contempt--he had lived too long to despise little things - but with a quiet won- der how so small a body could comprehend the great business of reckoning time. Ten years' acquaintance made them good friends, and the old sexagenarian wore a placid look when the master took- out his watch, on his way through the hall each morning, to com- pare the two time-pieces. ".Really!" the old clock seemed to say, "the little fellow is getting to be as regular as myself. See what it is to set a good example!"Master, clock   LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   45 and watch moved on harmoniously together, the pulse of each beating in unison, and giving law to the dwellers in the "Rolobin's Nest," by which name Mr. Grant's home was called. This nest was a stone cottage, built in the English style, in a beautiful and retired spot on the Ridge, about half a mile, as we have said, from the centre of the town. There were three acres of land about the house, which was laid out in orchard, lawn and garden. It was one of those quiet little homes that look like islands of peace to the eye of a weary traveller; and at the time of my story, or, rather, of the incidents in this chapter, these words might well apply to it; for there were fewer happier families than assembled round 'Squire Grant's fireside. . Mrs. Grant was a gentle, home-loving woman, who lived for her husband and chil- dren.  She. was seen regularly at church,   "  -    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, but otherwise was seldom away from home. There were three children. Edward, or, as he was generally called, Ned, the eldest son, was the pride of his father's heart; though, like most New England fathers, Mr. Grant was very much afraid his son would find out how much he loved him. Ned was a hand- some boy, tall, well-formed, with an abun- dance of brown curls above a white, high forehead, deep blue eyes, and a pleasant address. He was a favorite in society, and his mother looked forward in her heart to a brilliant career for Ned. He fitted for col- lege, but, to the great disappointment of the whole family, refused to enter, preferring a position in his father's bank. The father was. too much pleased in having his son with him to make serious objection, and the mother consoled herself with the pleasure of his presence at home. "Do not force his incli- nation," added dear old Grandfather Fletcher.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   47 ' Let him enter the bank. But I am disap- pointed, nevertheless; I had hoped to have seen him a clergyman before I was called away. -Ve must educate John." "' John will never look as well in the pul- pit, or make as fine an orator, as Ned," said the mother. "John is a good boy, but he is a homely little fellow." "He has a right good Scotch face," said the old gentleman, "and is a boy after my own heart,--a real Grant, I acknoNwledge; not as handsome as the Fletchers, who, as a family, were remarkable for beauty [I never received my full share]. But your Aunt Janet was the reigning belle of Con- cord in her day, and my brothers were tall and comely men." Grandfather Fletcher sighed while  he spoke, as if some sad chord of memory was suddenly, struck; then dropping the subject, asked if Mary was ready to walk   CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, home with him. He always preferred Mary for his companion,-- quiet, shy Mary, who grew like a fair wood flower between that tall cedar, Ned, and the sturdy young oak, John. Grandfather Fletcher lived in an old-fash- ioned farmhouse by the sea, among the peo- ple whom he had served faithfully for forty years. He was no longer their pastor, on account of the infirmities of age; but he retained his old home, and had chosen his grave in the churchyard beside the wife of his youth. He lived with his books; his library was the home of his heart, and the best books of many languages were gathered here. He walked every day to see his daugh- ter, often stopping at what he called his half- way house, Aunt Esther Mills' house. This was a pretty little wooden house a short walk from the Robins' Nest, the home of two maiden ladies, daughters of an intimate   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   49 friend and classmate of Mr., Fletcher. Ev- erybody in Oldbury knew and loved Aunt Esther Mills and her sister, Aunt Sabre. Their home was brightened by a young girl, a niece who was given to Aunt Esther by the mother when on her death-bed. Emily Mills was a few years younger than Mary Grant, but she was her most intimate friend. They were both pupils of Grand- father Fletcher, who had made them good Latin scholars, given them a tolerable knowl- edge of English history and of their own country, read often with them the old Eng- lish poets (I am sorry to\ add he did not appreciate the modern virtues of poetry), and taught the girls that one of the accom- plishments of an educated woman was to speak and write her own tongue correctly, - an accomplishment which he said was very rare in these days of literary women. The sombre library with its rare old folios, its   50     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Greek and Latin books, its piles of theolog- ical lore, with its one case of modernl litera- ture, was very familiar to the girls. They were always welcomed with old school po- liteness, and treated as kindly as if they had been two doves that had alighted to rest a while. The two girls, in a sudden fit of intellectual ambition, asked the old gentle- - man one day if he would read Milton through with them. "Yes, children; but I will not begin Wun- less you will read it in my way, and not *give up the task till you understand the poem." The promise was given, but many times before completing the work; were the girls sorry that they had begun it; for he kept them studying upon one page till every word and -phrase was analyzed, and,i as Em- ily Mills expressed it, "moulded, worked, and set to rise, baked, and eaten," till   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    51 "Paradise Lost" became a part of ourselves. For three months we lived and slept and dreamed only of the wars of angels and that grim old hero, Satan. This was grand- father's method of teaching. There must be no half-way work, no reading of worthless books, and no skimming. over good ones. The good old man had infinite patience with dulness and plodding ignorance, but none for hypocrisy and shams. His wife died in middle age, and it never entered the good man's head that any other person could supply her place. "She waits for me inside the golden gate," he often said to his daughter, Mrs. Grant. A housekeeper who had lived with them for many years managed the household and provided for his wants. Of his four children, one only remained to him.   A  grandson, Willie Fletcher, the child of his own eldest boy, lived with him; he was an orphan and blind. \   52     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, When about five years old he barely lived through the scarlet fever; a severe cold taken during convalescence terminated at last in the terrible affliction the loss of his eyesight. He was at the time of, which we write about fifteen years of age. His delicate health would not permit his mingling in the sports of the boys aside from his in- firmity; and he had been so long, the com- panion of his grandfather that he cared little for other society. He had learned to read the books for .the blind, and enjoyed his library, which in this case was parvum in multum; but his greatest enjoyment was music. He never wearied of it ; and as this taste developed itself, the old gentleman laid aside among other precious relics the ancient piano which had come to the parsonage with his young bride, and purchased an organ, plain in case, but of rare power and sweet-   "OSS IS SOM1ETIMES GAIN.   53 ness. Willie would improvise music varying as his own moods. When happy, strains of glad music would ring out from the old par- lor that would make glad the hearts that heard; and when he was sad or perplexed, the strains were pensive as the melody of Judea's harps by, the rivers of Babylon. He was very fastidious in the choice of his friends. The handsoome Ned was no favorite. Probably the reserve of the lat-' ter prevented Willie from a thorough ac- quaintance with him; but his face expressed great pleasure whenever he heard John's short and somewhat heavy tread at the garden gate. It was John that taught him chequers, making the black and white of different shapes, and teaching him the moves with great skill. IlHe sat by John's side in Sunday school, and often ventured into the woods with him, his quick ear catching the faintest bird music or the rustle of a squirrel   54     CAPTAIN JOHN; On, before John sighted them. fIe loved to sit in the sunshine with John, whittlingc or work- ing near him. John spent a great deal of his time at the old parsonage, enjoying the apple gathering in autumn, the sowing and planting in the spring, and the nut gathering in November. He never forgot that Wilhe was sensitive and delicate as a girl, and was gentle and kind in all his ways with him. Malry and EFmily were always happy to have him pres- ent at their recitations. He had one place in the library which was called TVillie's cor- ner, where he sat when they read Milton, his pale, beautiful face lighting up at some of the passages, or damp with tears at others. He always spoke of Mary to John as ';the lily," and of Emily as " the rose." "But- why?" said John; "you can see neither of them." "Ay! I remember, Johnnie, that they put  Z   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    55 white lilies on my mother's coffin; I could see them; and I remember, too, that I plucked a fresh-blown rose for her the day before she died. I was only three years old then, but I know just how the rose and lily look. Now, I think Mary must be fair and gentle; you see her voice is keyed low, while Emily's voice is like-why Johnnie -like Jenny Lind's bird song, and I have always thought that was like a rose." "TWhat does Stella look like?" said John. "Ay, Willie, don't you know?    Grand- father calls her an 'Oriole'-- golden robin, you know; but I always call her 'Violin.' Don't laugh, Willie; but I feel, when she is near me, as I did when Schaffe came here and brought such sweet music out of the violin. Oh, Johnnice it is nice when she comes to walk in the garden with me. Then I think of those lines of Tennyson- - 'Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, To the flowers, and be their sun.' ' '  '    \   O O     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, There were only two places where Willie cared to linger away from  home--at his Uncle Grant's and Aunt Esther Mills'. The kind heart of Aunt Esther was overflowing with love to all who suffered.  Wherever there was siclkness or crime, Aunt Esther was found, ready to comfort or redeem, The court-house andl the jail  the latter with stone walls, its grated windows and high fence studded with iron pikes-were in sight of her house. The accused in the dock and the condemned in the cells were the objects of her care and compassion. As she grew older, her charity grew   broader, and her brain more active in devising good. "She is like a golden russet," said Grand- father Fletcher; "good enough in autumn, but better as the winter lengthens." Aunt Esther never talked about religion, and would be puzzled for a reply if you asked her to relate her experience or tell the    state of her mind. She did not know much about herself. She kept a "diary,O' to be sure, but there was not a word in it about the exalted state of her feelings on Sunday, or the spiritual depression of Monday; but there were records like the following :-- "Went to-day to see Martha Gibbs, who was accused of stealing from her employer.   I think Martha is innocent; but Mrs. Wood- bridge is so sure that no one else could know where she always keeps her diamond breast- pin, and that Marthll  is the thief, that I am troubled to know what to do about it. "Jack Hyde is breaking his mother's heart by his bad conduct. Must see Jack to-mor- row, and get him a place to work. He is an active boy, and if he gets interested  in learning a trade, he will not mingle so much with bad company." Aunt Esther kept this journal because, as she said, her memory failed with her body Or . ,    58     CAPTAIN JOHN i OR, as she grew older, and "it was so bad to forget one needy creature to whom I might have done good." No one was so -bad that she did not find some alleviating circumstances, peculiar to that case; and when, asfter all her forbear- ance, they sinned again and again, she would say, "Well, our heavenly Father bears with them; why should I forsake them?   His tender mercies are over all his works, and he is kind to the evil and the unthankful." The dear soul was sadly deceived sometimes, and little Emily often made herself merry over Aunt Esther's proteges, who abused her kindness. Johnnlie Grant was a favorite with Aunt Esther, because, as Emily said, he never refused to carry bundles to the sick, and listened patiently to her annals of the poor. One pleasant morning in autumn, he came in as the family were at breakfast-Aunt   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   59 Esther pouring coffIT from an old-fashioned silver urn, an heir-loom in the family. It was a delicate repast of toast and omelet. There was a basket of fruit and a vase of flowers upon the table (Aunt Sabre said that her food tasted better if she looked at flowers while she ate). Aunt Esther poured some boiled milk into Emily's cup of coffee. '"Why, auntie dear I! where is the cream? I thought our 'Alderney', gave a great deal of milk." "And so she does, child. There never was a cow that did her duty better; but don't you know that the widow March has six little children, and the mother is sick? Poor thiligs! they are so puny, and have such a hungry look, that I that I touht a bowl of bread and milk every morning, for awhile, would do them so much good--only for a week. or two, dear, till the mother gets   60     CAPTAIN JOIN; OR, better; then you shall have your cream again." "The boiled milk is very nice, auntie. I am not certain but I like it better than cream. Yes, I am sure that I do, when I think of those children, each with a bowl of bread and milk to eat." "You can have cream from the Robin's -Nest, Emily," said John. "I wish you would bring it, Johnnie, and so fulfil the scripture that the ' liberal soul shall be made fat.' Why, Jolnnie, Aunt Esther is always 'lending to the Lord,' but never expects any interest. Last week John Rix pawned his coat for rum - the very coat which auntie gave him only two days before, to keep the rheumatism out of his poor old bones this winter." "Why, Emma dear," said Aunt Esther, "you forget to add how sorry he was after- * .    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    61 wards, and promised never to drink ardent spirits again if I would redeem it for him." "And you redeemed it, and he promised? I hope he will stick to his promise," said Aunt Sabre. "I am sure he will," said Aunt Esther, "he was so penitent." "Aunt Esther!" said Johnnie, they have just carried a little boy to jail." "A little boy to jail!" exclaimed Aunt Esther, dropping fork and toast atf once. "Yes, auntie; a pretty little boy, too. Sheriff Akerman has just locked him into his room. He is only ten years old." "The poor little :thing I What has he done?" "The story as I heard it is this: He lives ini Bedford, and was at worlk with an uncle in a Mr. Low's garden. ,Mr. Low had been busy there himself, and left his coat hanging in the ,grapo arbor. When he left the gar-   62     CAPTAIN JOHM; OR, den to go to the house he forgot to put on his coat, and' it remained hanging in the arbor an hour or more. "When he returned for it the man and boy were gone to their dinner, and the porte- monnaie in which there were a hundred dol- lars was missing.  A woman who lived in the next house said that she saw the boy throw something over the fence when he went home to dinner.  The boy was ar- rested and is in our jail." "Did they find the pocket-book?" said Aunt Esther. "No; it has never been found." "Didn't they suspect the man at all?" "I guess not, auntie. But there is the schoolbell; I must go." "Do just stop at the workhouse and ask Auntie Cook and Bctsey Brown to come here to dinner. We have a couple of chiclkens to cook for dinner, and as our faimily is small   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   63 I would like to have some one share it with us; aid you know they don't have many luxuries in that place." "I like roast chicken and new apple pie too," said John, in the assumed tone of a beggar asking -charity. "You cannot expect an invitation from auntie," said Emma, "unless you are poor and needy. She never threads her needles with camels." "What is that you are saying, Emma? You know John is always welcome here; and, come to think of it, Auntie Cook is so lame and old, why cannot you come with her at twelve- o'clock and help her across the streets?" John made a little grimace, intended only for Emily's eyes. These danced merrily as she said,- "Auntie means that you shall earn your dinner. I will be watching for you at noon,   "    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, with lame Betsey on one side and poor blind Auntie Cook on the other." "Eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. Begin the world in that way, Johnnie, and you will mount likeian eagrle and run and not be weary," said Aunt Sabre. "I must run now, whether I am weary or not," said John, as he sped like an arrow from the bow in the direction of school. Aunt Esther washed the silver and china after breakfast; it had always been her work from childhood; the same silver and the same genuine old china that her mother's hands had guarded with tender care. Aunt Sabre went into the kitchen to preside over the trussing of the chickens. Emily's offers of assistance were refused with, "No, darl- ing; go to your music; God has given you that gift and you must cultivate it. Every talent is to be improved.  But come to me *             l   "OSS IS, SOMETIMES GAIN.   65 in two hours; I must go out for a short time." Emily knew very well that there was some errand of mercy to be done. As she ex- pected, she found her aunt dressed to go out. "To tell the truth, Emma, Il cannot eat my dinner till I have seen that poor boy in the jail. Those stone walls with their iron spikes have been reproaching me all the morning, and something in my heart has been saying, 'I was in prison and ye vis- ited me not.' A little boy of ten in jail! It must not be!" "I suppose some children are awfully wicked, -auntie," said Emily. "You mustn't suppose, any such thing, child. Childhood is susceptible to good influences, I am sure; easily led into sin, but drawn from evil by silken cords. It is a terrible wrongm to abuse a child. If this.   "    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, boy is innocent, the very act of putting him in that place may mLake a bad man of him. I can do no less thanl go and see him." "The very sight of your face will do him good, auntie," said Emily, as she kissed her aunt. "There, speed away on your angcel errands, and I will set the table. I suppose I needn't get out the double-twilled damask napkins or the Sevre's finger bowls that Uncle Nat gave you." ' "You are making fun of my ways, you naughty child. Set the table -nicely, and gather fresh flowers, and mind do not forget the pears. Do you ever think, my darling, what glorious things are prepared for those of us whom God will bring into his king- dom? We shall drink of the wine from the celestial vineyards, and eat of the fruits that grow by the river of life. Do you think I could walk those golden streets and sit down in the garden of spices there if I had not   ' LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  67 shared my earthly blessings with the needy in this world? '" With these words on her lips the straw bonnet with its lavender silk trimming, and the soft, antique cashmere shawl disappeared from the house.  The keeper knew Aunt Esther well;. he had often opened the iron doors that she might visit some poor child of sin. He was a kind, just man, with a little less confidence than Aunt Esther in the goodness of human nature, and a little less hope of reforming all the wicked. "This is a hard case, I think, myself, ma'am.  The' little fellow is bright as a button, and does not seem at all hardened. I carried a- picture-book to him this morn- ing, when I gave him his breakfast." "Do you think he is guilty, Mr. Aker- man?" "Cannot tell, ma'am. The older I grow theemore I am puzzled in judging crinmilals;   68     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, the most guilty often wear the look of inno- cence." The boy's room was clean, and contained a cot bed, a little stand with a Bible upon it, and a stool upon which the boy sat read- ing his picture-book. He was a pretty child, with large, blue eyes, and an intelligent face that won Aunt Esther's sympathy at once. "I am sorry to see you here, my little fellow," she said. "I am only here on 'spicion, ma'am; only. on 'spicion. I didn't take the money." Aunt Esther was sure of this when she looked at him. She wondered how magis- trates could commit innocent people. She was not fond of the law, and, like most women, felt a repugnance to its forms. The boy's jacket was ragged, his shoes out -at the toes, and the little ribbon cravat round his neck worn and soiled. He repeated hist story, which corresponded with what John ,   ,  v   "OSS IS SOM{ETIEMES GAIN.   69 had already related, but ended by saying, "I'm only here on 'spicion, ma'am; only on 'spicion. i didn't take the money, ma'aml." Dinner was on the table when Aunt Esther returned home, and Emily was listening pa- tiently to Auntie Cook's oft-repeated story of her husband who was lost at sea, and her sonl who was drowned in the river. John was showing Betsey the garden to her in- finite delight, for she was familiar only with the cabbage beds and onions of the poor- house garden. Aunt Esther's manner was flurried, and she was almost absent-minded; for she gave Auntie Cook a cup of black"l tea on one side of her plate and a cup of -green tea on the other. She piled the chicken and vegetables upon Betsey's plate till the poor child, who felt that gratitude required the consumption of all favors thus bestowed, was made very   70     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, uncomfortable, but could not deny herself the pie that followed, with its flaky crust and rich, juicy interior.         .\ No sooner was the repast finished and Bet- sey Brown despatched to school (she moved like an alderman after a civic dinner), and Auntie Cook seated in an easy-chair in the kitchen with Aunt Sabre, who was prime minister in that domain, than Aunt Esther donned bonnet and shawl and was away on another errand. As she went out FEnmily said, - "Do come home soon, Aunt Esther. Auntie Cook's trials and experiences are- getting too heavy for me to bear. I treated her this morning as if she were a princess in disguise." "Which she is, darling. The sorrows of this life have purified the dear soul, and some day she will walk the golden city, wearing the crown of life."-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    71 "Oh, auntie, can't we get to heaven but through sorrow and poverty?" "Is the servant greater than his master?"? said Aunt Esther, as she turned to kiss the cheek of the young girl. "My darling, I dare not pray that you may be saved all sorrow ill this world, for this is not God's way of dlealing with us; but I do pray that he will give you strength to bear it, and be purer for the discipline of it. I am going now to see what I can do for that poor child in the jail. Only think, Emma, if it were one of our boys!" "Not a supposable case, auntie." -"But the child is not guilty. 'Only on 'spicion, ma'am! only on 'spicion!'-that keeps running in my head. Is my shawl on straight? Tie my bonnet-strings in a nice bow.  There is no rip in my gloves, I believe. Never wear gloves with rips in them, child." /-    72     CAPTAIN JOJiN; OR, There was about this dear old maiden lady a chasteness and taste in dress that indicated the true woman. A neat shoe, well-fitted gloves, and a lavender-colored ribbon were essential to her comfort. She thought of, them, however, only while dressing; then her thoughts returned to the needy objects of her ministry.  Her walk, that day, led her along  the crest of the Ridge, through the elm-shaded avenue, down  to the lower land, and eastward toward the river's mouth. She was bound   to Grandfather Fletcher's house.  The  old gentleman saw her as she  entered the garden gate, and, with old-time gallantry, came out to welcome her. He   brought her into the library, seated her in his own   easy-chair, and gave her an antique fan with eastern spices dight, then sat down  to hear what she might say. Her time was precious; for every moment which   "OSS IS SOMETTMES GAGI.    73 that boy spent in jail, she felt as a reproach  to a Christian community. The good pastor listened with interest to her story, maklin(P allowance, as was his custom; for Aunt Esther's charity covered' a multitude of sins-" sometimes," as Emily said, "when it would be better to uncover 'them." Aunt Esther's plan was to find a home for the boy, and thus persuade the prosecutor to stop the prosecution.  She succeeded in finding the home with a worthy farmer who lived near the parsonage, and then rode some miles to see the prosecuting attorney. She did not reach home again till nine o'clock in the evening, but very happy, for she was almost sure of the boy's release on the morrow. She received a message from Mr. Akerman the next day, that the boy was at her service.   74     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Now, John, you and Emily must go with me," she said. The young people did not see the neces- sity; but, as an expedition together, even to the county jail, was not repugnant to them, they prepared to invade the stony ramparts, under convoy of Aunt Esther. The heavy air, the semi-darkness, and the loneliness of the place oppressed John, and he shuddered involuntarily. "What is the matter, John?" said Emily. "Nothing; only .Ishuddered as it is said we do when some one is walking over our grave."  "Nonsense!" said Aunt Esther. "That's a foolish superstition." The narrow, high roomi from  which no view of the outer world could be obtained, the bare walls, and the forlorn look of the child, who had left his breakfast untouched,   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   75 and whose checks were wet with tears, made the visitors glad thattthey had come to open the prison doors to him. When told by Mr. Akerman that he was free to go with the lady, he jumped up, wiped his eyes, and caught his cap, which hung upon a peg. "Can I go, and never come back??" "Yes; if you take care never to do ally- thing which will bringt you here." "I haint done nothing n w, sir. I am only in on 'spicion, sir.' A jacket of John's, a new ribbon neck-tie, a clean collar and new shoes gave quite an air of respectability to the child. He made himself very useful to Aunt Sabre-in the kitchen, brought water and coal, swept the garden path, split the kindlings, and was handy in such domestic duties. "Now, Charlie," said Aunt Esther, as she brought him into the parlor, where hung a few fine pictures and choice engravings,   76     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Iook at these pictures, and tell me which you like best."  The boy went from one to the other, slowly and critically, then stopped before an exquisite line-engraving of one of Ra- phael's Madonnas. Aunt Esther was de- lighted. She had feared he would prefer "Bonaparte Crossing the Alps "- a picture not to her taste. She then sent him into the garden for a basket of pears. He brought them.  She gave him some to eat, and added, - "Charlie, you can sit in the summer-house; but when you hear the bell ring, you can come in and eat your dinner. After that, I will go with you to Farmer Little's house, where I hope you will stay, and prove to us all that you are a good boy." "Yes, ma'am," said Charlie, as he took book and pears, and proceeded to the sum- mer-house.   Loss IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    " "The dear little fellow " said Aunt Esther.  "I can take some comfort now that he is among birds and flowers instead -of being shut up in that gloomy   jail. Emma, bring n-e the socks I had begun to knit for John; I can finish them  for Charlie." "The soft, fine, white socks will hardly be fit for farm work, auntie." "Why, child!" said Aunt Esther, re- proachfully, ' don't you suppose he will go to church and Suday-scool? It is a great mistakle to give nothing to the poor but worn or coarse clothes. We must cultivate the I love of the beautiful by giving them flowers and books and something pretty to wear sometimesl." "Yes, auntie,;' said Emma, while a smile played about her beautiful lips. "You are smiling at your old auntie's notions, cilild; but you will see things dif- /   78     CAPTAIN JOHN, OR, ferently one of these days. Who knows what that boy may become?  Tliink of all the great men who have risen from obscurity -of 'Watt, Franklin, the missionary Mor- ' rison, and"- "Yes, auntie; they are all mentioned in that little book, 'Shining Examples.'"' "There! I am glad you have mentioned it. That will be the very book to put into this child's bundle. Run and get it for me." In about an hour, Aunt Sabre came! into the parlor. "Esther, don't you think that boy can be trusted to go over to Robin's -Nest? I need more eggs for my pudding, and John told me that they had more than they could use." "Of course he can, Sabre. I'il ring thes bell. What time is it?" "It must be after eleven; for I heard the whistle of the Boston train five minutes ago."   79C "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAI  .    79 The bell was rung, but no Charlie ap- peared; again and again, but no response. "He must have fallen asleep. I don't wonder; for he could not have slept much in that jail." "Just run and see what the child is doing," said Aunt Sabre.  "I must have those eggs."'  Emily returned with the "Swiss Family Robinson," open at the fifteenth page, but no Charlie; nor could she find him, though she had searched the whole garden, looked up into every apple-tree and in every grape- arbor. "Perhaps he is in the wood-shed, cutting some kndinligs," said Aunt Esther; "I will go myself;" a shade of trepidation in her voice. But the bird had flown;" nor, from that time to-this, has little Charlie been seen or heard of il Oldbury. ^                  .   .   CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "That railroad whistle was too much for him," said Emily.   It generally has a greater charm for boys than Madonnas." But such experiences did not harden Aunt Esther's heart. Her loving nature forgave easily; and when  driven I to bay by the arguments of those who believe charity should only be given to the worthy poor, she would answer, "Well, well, publicans and sinners shared our Lord's love and ten- der care; perhaps he will not find fault with me if I make some mistakes of judgment in my old age.  I like to make people happy, even if they have not the virtue of Ruth or the goodness of Saint John." "You dear, blessed auntie," Emily would say. "You are not old, for your heart is younger than mine, and no one shall find "ault with you for tryingl to heal Mr. Aker- man's patients. I  hope you will find on3 grateful for your kindness. What should A.                .   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   81 I have done if you had not taken me in when I was a forlorn orphan? I sometimes feel that I am an ungrateful child." "Ungrateful, child! Why, you are the sunshine of my life. You were but three months old when I took you from    your mother's arms. I carried you through the measles and whooping-cough  and scarlet fever. Didn't you repay my love by liv- ing through them all, and growing up a strong, healthy girl? Ungrateful! Don't ever use that word in connection with your- self. Your love repays all my care."   CHAPTER III. Ned in the Bank.-Tom Wood at Sea.-John in College.- John's Vacation. AFTER Edward Grant decided to go into his father's bank, a fam- ily consultation was held, Grand- father Fletcher in the chair, and John was nominated to college. He was to make a thorough preparation at the High school, and recite once a week to Grand- father Fletcher in Greek and Latin. - "Bet- ter be over-fitted than barely pass, John," he said. "Well, Tom, the matter is decided; I am to be a minister, I suppose," said John to his friend, Tom Wood. "Grandfather will think it is in answer-to his prayers."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GtAIN.  ( But what do you say to it, John?" asked Tom.  "If I cannot. go to sea, Tom, I have no objection to college. Mother says that it would just break her heart if I should go to sea." The boys were seated in Currier's ship- yard watclhincg the progress of a vessel still in the stocks. They had been familiar with the sea from infancy, and understood all the parts of a vessel from keel to mainmast. Tom was born to the sea. There was no more doubt of his destiny than of that of the beautifully-modelled hull that lay under the workmen's hands, preparing for her bap- tisnmal day. Tom's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been sailors. They took to the water by instinct; "were am- phibious animals," old Captain Wood said. "I wish we could go to sea together, John; but if either of us is to be a learned   84    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, man it must be yourself. To' tell the truth I do not like school, and shouldl have been tempted to play truant more than I have done if you had not helped me through old Greenleaf's arithmetic. I would almost as soon be shut up in jail with wood and a jack-knife." "On the supposition that you were in only on 'spicion, like Aunt Esther's Charlie,"' said John, laughing. "I was tliinking only of the confinement, John. If I were in as a punishment for crime, I doi't know-but I think I should die; by my own hand perhaps. I am not good, John; no, not at all; my temper is awful and I need you with me. I tell you it does me good to beat Ned Ford when he tries to bully the little fellows or vex the girls." "God gives us strength to defend the weak, Tom. I do not knuow as you were   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   85 much in the wrong there; at any rate, the whole school liked you the better for it." "Father says that I must learn to control my temper before I get to be a sea-captain," replied Tom; " but my grlandfather says that I will learn that fast enough if I begin as a common sailor, which I mean to do. I mean to work my own way up in the world." '"Halloo, boys!" said the master of the ship-yard, who saw them as they sat talking on a pile of- boards. "You will be at the launching next week, I suppose." "Of course, sir. Got a name yet?" "Yes,; I fixed upon one yesterday. I was down here at work when there came one or two forlorn looking little girls pickinog up chips; we have poor children here after them every day.  One of the girls was Dick Biurk's child, and looked as such a drunkard's child generally does -ragged and dirty. She had filled her basket and Iy \   86     CAPTAIN JOHNB; OR, was staggering along under its weight, when a little rascally boy came along and, from mere wanton mischief, gave the -basket a kick and sent the chips scattering in all directions, and broke one of the handles of the basket. One of my workmen came to me for orders just then, and I thought no more of the affair till ,about half an hour afterwards, when my attention was attracted by a bright object running across the yard. It was Stella Drummond trying to comfort the poor girl who had lost her chips. 'Never mind,' she said to the child, who was crying as if her heart would break; 'I will help you fill your basket.' 'Dad will whip me 'cause I broke the handle,' mut- tered the girl. 'I can mend it,' said Stella. She begged a piece of rope from the shop, made a niew handle from it, filled the basket with chips, and lifting one side of it helped the girl to carry it home. This done, she   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   87 came skipping back to see the new brig, brirght as a bird on a summer morning. Then I thought of a name for my vessel. 'Stella' it shall be,; but keep it a secret, boys, till the launch." "Hurrah! ' cried the two boys, throwing their hats up. "'Good luck to the Star of Oldbury." There were a few months more of school for the boys; then Tom went to sea and John to college.  Their ways parted for life, as they supposed to meet occasionally in their native town, and to remember, as men will in old age, the friendships of their boyhood.   Our task will be to relate the singular incidents which brought them to- gether again, uniting their destiny on the sea they both loved so well. John worked hard at college for one year. Heo was not a brilliant scholar; but sturdy,   O0     CAPTAIN JOHN; OB, persevering, slow to acquire, but retailni, l the knowledge thus gained.  The long-looked for vacation came at last. As he took out his best coat for the journey, he laughed to see how his hands run through the sleeves, leaving the latter half way to his elbows, while an uncomfortable feeling of tightness about the shoulders annoyed -him. "Halloo, Halford! See how my coat has shrunk," he said to his chum. "And how fast your pants have run up hill," added Halford. "Ha, ha!" laughed Johnnie; "my feet look like the twin rocks in low tide." He looked at himself in the glass. "Don't I cut a comical figure?" he said. his face was round as the full moon, while his hair, cut rather too short by the barber, made his phiz still more chubby, and the light coat drew his shoulders forward. A    JLOSS IS OMTIME"1MrS A1N. G0IU "Never mind; perhaps I'll get a new coat  when I go home." "Perhaps!  No doubt," said his chum. "I know from experience that a fellow who goes home with a record like yours, and a letter from the president in his pocket, will get pretty much all he wants from   his mother.  These mothers do all they can to spoil us, Jack."' John did not answer for a moment. The words carried him back to the face of his mother, and he recalled certain words in her last; letter: "I have counted the weeks and the days, and now I am counting the hours before I shall see you coming in at the door. Every little while I fancy I hear your whis- tle and the short, quick step which I know so well. I know which of my boys is com- ing by the step and the way the gate is shut. Ned is slower and more precise, walks more gracefully than my short Jack, and is always,   as railroad men say, 'on time'; but when you were a little fellow, you used to come running in almost breathless, saying, ' Oh mother! please excuse me; I couldn't get, home before, I had so much to do.' You were always hurried. Is it so now? I long to hear that step, and I promise not to scold you if you do come with dirty boots." "I know she will be glad to see me," thought John; ", and dear old grandpa will put on his spectacles and read the president's letter, and then say, 'I thank God, John, that you have been kept from temptation, and have made such a good beginning.' And Willie will look so happy, and move his hands slowly over my stubby hair and round face, -those hands of his, delicate as a lady's, and with fingers that seem to have eyes in them; and then he will smile and say, 'You are looking well, Johnnie.'"' "Strange how much my Cousin Willie can   J   learn by the sense of touch, Halford," he said aloud. "I really believe I could keep a secret from my father, sharp and penetrat- ing as his eyes are, sooner than I could keep them from Willie. He detects every shade of variance in the voice, and learns fromi that whether you are sad or happy. Only think, Halford, not one of my friends in Oldbury have died, not one has been seriously ill during the year I have been in college." t There are misfortunes worse than death," said Halford, sadly. "I beg your pardon," said John, with a face full of sympathy. Halford's elder brother who had studied a profession, and bade fair to become distin- guished in it, had been attacked with soften- ing of the brain, and was a maniac in an insane asylum. "Yes, Halford," said John, I think that misfortune sadder than dethh. I am ashamed    OAT'AIN JOHN; OR, of myself for saying that Tom Wood's ab- senco at sea was a great trial to me. He will be gone more than a year longoer." "I wish I was with him,' said Halford. "I used to wish so when I first came to college," said John; "but I am  contented now to go through college." "Will you leave all your books here, John?" "Yes, as we have the same rooms again. I never thought, Hal, to become so attached to them; they are quite like home, thanks to our mothers for curtains and pictures, shoe bags, brackets, and paper-holders, say- ing nothing of lounge and easy-chair.  On second thought. I  will, take my Latin and Greek books home, for grandfather will in- sist -upon examining me, and I shall object decidedly to his using the fossiliferous books in his library." There were, few happier boys than John   Grant when he jumped into the carriage which was to convey himself and his .has- tily-packed trunk to Oldbury. To be sure, his trousers were short, and his round, plump body looked like a dumpling that had swelled to goodly proportions in its bag which a lit- tle cooking had made too tight for it. His happy face was a passport to favor every- where, and it grew rounder and brighter as the train neared home. "Guess'your folks wont be glad to see you at all," said Mr. Brown, a farmer who lived about three miles from Oldbury, and  who took the train tt Glencoe.           i  sOf course'not," said John. "Have you  seen any of them lately?" "Miss Esther was down to our place day  before yesterday arter some. cream and new-  laid eggs for Miss Simms, who is most gone with consumption. 'Mazin' good woman that Miss Mills, but she wouldn't do for county   "    CAPTAIN JOENW; OR, magistrate; she's too tender hearted to pun- ish rogues. How you have grown, Johnnie; the folks will hardly know you. Easy work going to college, ain't it? Now, if you had been out haying this summer, you'd have lost flesh, I reckon, instead of looking plump as a partridge. Your brother Ned has grown t'other way--shot up tall and slim as a pine. He was out our way yesterday, col- lectin' for the-bank. He's 'mazin' smart; beats his father all holler at business;, reck- ons interest as fast as a squirrel can run, and never makes a mistake to the fraction of a cent. He'll be a rich man one of these days, as sure, as my name is Obed Brown." "Yes, I guess so," said John, recalling just then the fact that Ned was the only one of the family that had not sent him some gift in his absence. Grandfather had once enclosed five dollars in a letter; his mother seldom  wrote without sending a   "OSS IS SOMETTMFS GAI  .   95 bill; May had shared her pocket money, and Wilhe had sent a long-hoarded gold piece. It was owing to this generosity that John had been able to buy presents for many of his friends; that there now lay in his trunk some pretty bracelets for Emma, a portfolio for his sister, a beautiful engrav- ing of "Faith" for his mother, and a curious puzzle of bits of ivory which he knew Wil- lie would enjoy putting together in various forms. As he rode onward, every minute decreasinog the distance between himself and home, he recalled the faces of those who would give him  a welcome.  Now  "our folks," with John, included not only his own family, but grandllfather, Willie, and the housekeeper, at the parsonage, Aunts Esther, Sabre, and Emily, and Tom and Stella. Oldbury would hardly seem like home- without Tom. John's father met him at the station.   96     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, John thought he had never realized be- fore what a fine, dignified man he was; but the gray hairs were more numerous now, and he looked a little careworn. "I am glad that I have a good record," thought John, as his father said, "Welcome home, John; how well you are looking." Mrs. Grant had heard the whistle. The cook was impatiently waiting to bring the dinner to the table.  Mrs. Grant, in her black silk dress and becoming little cap, was at the door watching, while Mary had gone to meet them. He saw his mother and bounded forward. "Oh John, my boy! you have come at last." There were tears in her eyes, but smiles followed quick when she saw how much he had outgrown his clothes. Bridget coming in at the instant, exclaimed   "OSS IS SOMETIIES GAIN.   97 "Why, Johnlnie, darlint! it's surely not your own clothes ye're wearing When Ned came in John, saw what was not perceptible to the others- -that there was a change also in him. The artist, Time, worlks with so slow a touch that we need absence to see the effect of his pencil. Ned was taller, and his handsomely-moulded fea- tures had settled into the repose of man- hood. He greeted his brother kindly. He was never demonstrative, and very reticent even in his own family. He excused him- self soon after dinner, as business required him to be at the bank.' His mother re- marked, as if in excuse for her elder son, - "You cannot imagine what a busy man our Ned has become." Just then Aunt Esther entered, her dear old face bright with smiles. Her unselfish soul shone through her eyes. "Why, Johnnie! I am  delighted to see kn,     '    98     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, you back again. I saw you come about half an hour since." "How could that be, auntie?" asked John. "Why, Aunt Kate, our old washerwoman, -you remember her, -is sick. Her hus- band has gone out of town to get work, and she is all alone and very forlorn; says some folks haint no charity for a poor black woman's ' horology'; thinki maybe it is only a white lady's complaint; but 'she's got it awful bad, no mistake, all over her head.' While I was there, I saw you come from the depot with your father, and I couldn't resist the temptation to come in and take a look at you. You have improved in your looks, John." "There was room for it, auntie." "But not in your clothes. Why, child! you must have a new suit at onced' "So mother says." "How lucky, now, that Jim Dunn is just   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   99 a size smaller than yourself! He was hurt on the railroad last week, and hasn't a decent suilt to wear." "He shall have mine, auntie, as soon as Draper finishes the new suit." e John walked home with Aunt Esther, first changing his coat for one of Ned's; stopped to take a look round the garden with Emma, and eat a few of the peaches and pears which Aunt Sabre had saved purposely for him. Then he took his way to the parsonage. John loved his birthplace. The old town was very dear to him, and it seemed more beautiful than ever as he walked along the Ridge that autumn day. The tall elms were still in full leafage, and every court-yard was ornamented with shrubs and evergreens.- John knew all the dwellers in them, and his heart went out kindly to them all. A young girl stood on the portico of one of them, feeding a canary bird, whose cage i .               -     , .   100    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  hung in the sunlight. It was Stella, who, as soon as she saw John, came running down the avenue to greet him, her brown curls tossing to the breeze. "You have come at last, John! It seems an age since you went away. Mrs. Wood says the sight of your face will be the next best thing to seeing Tom. There was a package of letters came from him last even- ing, and Mrs. Wood is keeping yours to give it to you herself." "Where was Tom When he wrote?" "In Calcutta; and--isn't it too bad, John?-he will stay there three months, and then the vessel may be ordered to a South American port." "That is too bad," said John. "But Tom is well and happy," said Stella, with a brightening look, and says that, if you were with him, he would be the happiest man that sails the seas. He does not think   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   101 much of colleges, and mourns over your hard fate; but, really, you don't look much like an object of compassion " looking archly at him.  "Nor feel like one, Stella. In truth, I like college, and wish Tom were there with me." Stella shook her curly head. "No; that would never do. Tom was happier on the sea-if only he wouldn't go such long voyages!" "It is hardly Oldbury without Tom," said John, ruefully. "Come and see father," said Stella; "he has been through college, and you and he can talk Greek together." As John walked onward, after bidding Stella "good evening," he said to himself, "It pays one for going away from home to receive such a welcome on returning." As he came in sight of his grandfather's   102    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, house, he saw Willie standing at the gate, his ear turned in the direction of the road; the next instant, he started out of the- gate and came toward him. He was the first to speak: :'Ay, Johnnie! you cannot deceive me. I know your step. I have been listening for it to-day; for we heard that you would return on the ninth." He threw his arm round John's neck, and laid one hand on his face. John took off his cap, and Willie's hand moved slowly over face, head and shoulders. "Is it all right?" said John. "All that I hoped and prayed," answered Willie, as the tears filled his eyes. "Why, Willie! what do you mean? How can you tell that it is all right with me?" "Ay, Johnnie; God. leadeth his blind chil- dren by a way you know not-you that, having eyes, see not."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   103 "' Where is grandfather?" asked John. "In the library." But the old gentleman had heard the click of the garden gate, and came, without hat or cane, his white hair streaming over his temples, to see his boy. "Stand a minute, John, and let me look at you." John stood erect, while the old gentleman. gave him a long, searching look. The clear, gray eyes of the boy did not quail before this scrutiny, for it was an honest soul that looked through them. "Thank God, my boy!   I believe you have come out of this first ordeal harmless. God keep you through all your college course!" "Amen!" said Willie. The old housekeeper came to welcome John. ' I declare, Mr. Fletcher," she said,   104     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "that boy is clear Grant; not a particle of Fletcher in him." "I agree with you," said the old gentle- man, evidently better pleased than the house- keeper that it was so. Grandfather was cdelighted to talk with John about his studies, and John equally pleased to find that the old gentleman had not forgotten what it was to be a freshman. They went into the orchard, where the golden pippins were ripeninga fast, gathering their gold from the sunbeams, and rivalling in beauty the autumn flowers- old-fashioned flowers, grandfather's favorites -marigolds, poppies, chrysanthemums and zinnias. In the arbor John found a book laid open, as if some one had been reading there not long before.  He took it up carelessly, and found  the leaf turned to this passage:- "There was One who, amid all the sill and shame  of this world, its hard routine, its   "OSSW IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   105 distortion, its bitterness, its falsehood, was always tender, always strong, giving his life for the race; full of faith in God the Father; full of hope for man; without disguise, with- out pretence-- the God-man, our Saviour and our example." Now, John was not much given to read- ing like  e this. He read his Bible twice a day; he promised his mother to do so. He tried to do righlt, having a tender conscience; but the idea of aiming to be like this of following closely in such footsteps- was not put down in his programme of life. He re- read it; and as he was doing so, Willie came and sat beside him, saying,-- "Your sister MAary was here this morning and read a while to me." "Did she read this?" said Johnnie, read- ing the sentence aloud. Grandfather came and leaned on his staff,   106    CAPTAIN JOHN'; OR, with his broad-brimmed, black hat on his head, and listened. "Ay, Johnnie! if you will read that so as never to forget it, it will do yon good-- "always tender, always strong." They walked around the garden and or- chard till the setting sun reminded John of one more call that he must make.!He bade his friends good evening, and jumped lightly over the garden wall and went "across lots" to see Tom's mother. The good woman met himn with smiles the first moment and tears the next. "Ah, Johnnie, I envy your mother. Her heart doesn't ache o' nights when there is a storm; she never lies awake listening to the, wind, and thinking maybe your grave will be where she will never go to it,--in the depths of the ocean, or among strangers who care nothing for you. Men little think what sad hearts are at the fireside weeping and   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   107 praying for them. I only wish Tom was with you in college; then for three years to come I could see him twice a year; nom I shall perhaps see him but once in all that time." "I often wish I was with him, Mrs. Wood." "Don't wish so, Johnnie, for the sight of you does my heart good; but here is your letter." John hastened home to have the letter all to himself, but he can hardly- help our shar- ing it with him: "DEAR- JOHNNIE, - I am vanishing, evap- orating, passing away, going off in vapor- literally, as the Bible speaking in a figure of speech has it; my life is even as a vapor that vanisheth away, all owing to the tremendous power of this Calcutta sun. It is not the same sun that shines for you in Oldbury, though your college books may assert it in   108    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, positive terms. Your sun is good-tempered, genial; a rollicking, merry fellow that gets up early in the summer and lies in bed late in winter, like a sensible fellow. Your sun sends out good healthful beams that warm the blood in winter for the children who go to school or play in the snow, and heal the rhefimatism of the old in summer; it tosses gold to the curls of the maiden, and silver to the hair of the old man. Here the sun is a fiery serpent that carries a deadly poison in his fangs; he steals the rose from woman's cheek, and the glow of health from man; there is copper and lead in his beams; no silver and gold. We shut him from our houses, and cover ourselves from his gaze when we go out. In short, it is a fearful climate, John, and there are hard spots in a sailor's life. I wouldn't like to see you roughing it as'some of us do; but if you were on the ship I would help you, to bear   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  109 it. I dreamed about you last night, and the dream was so strange I will tell it to you. The vessel had come in to Cushing'ss wharf, and as soon as my work was over I ran up the- Ridge to 'Squire Drummond's house. Stella came out to meet me, all in tears, and said, 'Oh Tom! Tom! why didn't you come one day sooner?  If you had been here John wouldn't have drowned; you would have saved him.' 'John drowned!' I exclaimed; and I could say no more, for, I was weak as a baby.  'Yes,' said she; 'he went up river in a sailboat to the upper bridge, you know, where the current is so strong. He was alone, but no one thought John could be drowned, he is such a good swimmer; but the boat was found empty down river where it had floated, and to- day they have recovered the body.  Oh Tom, if you had only come sooner!' I awoke covered with perspiration, and it was   "O    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, a long time before I could convince myself that it was not a dream. Now, John, prom- ise me that you will not go to the upper bridge till I return. Write the promise in your next letter, if you are not drowned already. I cannot tell you when we shall be at home. Our captain has some notion of going to Buenos Ayres.  We sailors don't know much about his plans;' our duty is to obey orders. Write as soon as you get this, and hand to my father; he will know how to direct." John laid aside the letter, and taking his pen commenced a letter as follows: "DEAR TOM, -I have no faith in dreams. When a friend has such a doleful one as yours, I quote the old saying,--"Dhreams go by contraries," says Rory O'Moore. Nev- ertheless, to ease your anxious mind, I prom- ise not to go to the 'Laurels' in a boat till   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   1" you return. I always feel out of patience with Caesar when I read the story of his death, because he did not heed Calphurnia's dream and remain at home on that fatal ides of March. But then, Tom, I do not sup- pose Brutus would have foregone his mur- derous design had Caesar remained by his wife that day. Then Caesar would not have been Ccesar, had he allowed himself to be turned from his purpose by the whim of a weak woman. But you are no weak woman, and I am, no Caesar; therefore I will keep away from the upper bridge. "I wish you were here, Tom. It pays for all the homesickness and hard study of col- lege, to come home and find so warm a welcome froin old friends. I forget what a rough, homely cub I am, under the petting of aunts and cousins and all the good folks of Oldbury.  I never enjoyed life more; only one drawback -your absence. There   "2     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, are tea-parties, picnics, socials, and sails down river, enough to keep me busy all the vacation. Stella is the life of these parties. She is the brightest little star in the galaxy. She is so merry and bright that Miss Hol- core, who thinks people must be gloomy to be good, said, the other day, that Stella needed trouble to make her a Christian. "Wheni Aunt Esther heard of it, she said it was a great pity that Miss Holcom couldn't recommend religion by greater cheerfulness; and what do you think Wilhe said? It is so beautiful, I must repeat it:--'God some- times gives us a glimpse of angel-life here below, and we see some who do not need sorrow to purify.' "Aunt Esther has another 'hobby,' as some of the folks say; but I think it is no hobby, but a noble project, viz: to stop all rum- selling in this city. She sees so much suf- fering from this cause, that it almost breaks   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   113 her heart. 'Wives and children I wives and children!' she says to me -'Oli, John! if I were only a man, I would rouse the coun- try and make a crusade, like Peter the Her- mit, to get the wives and children, yea, anid their poor, weak, tempted husbands, out of the power of the rum-sellers--the worst Turks and infidels in this world!' "'I am glad you are not a man,' I replied, 'only a dear, good, noble woman, that does more good than ten men.' "'Oh, Johnnie! I am nothing but a poor, weak old woman; but I will not hide my one talent in a napkin.' "Your mother pets me for your sake. She said, yesterday, 'John, I do believe you look like our Tom.' See the power of imtg- ination-blue eyes, tow hai a'nd a freckled face like bright, dark eyes, curly hair, and cheeks with a fine color in them! I enjoy the illusion. Our set are leaving school and 8   "4    CAPTAIN JOHN; ORn, settling themselves. Tom Burns is captain of the brig Ida. Sam Howard is fitting for college. Jack Hardy is a clerk in New York; and John Cole is studying law. "There is not a smarter fellow in the whole lot than our Ned. He will be the richest man in Oldbury, the business men, prophesy. For my part, I am sorry that he is so much absorbed in business. I see very little of him; for he has no time to attend our parties, and he is reserved and busy with books and papers at home. For myself, I like fun as well as ever, and can fly a kite and throw ball and run a race with as much zest as in the old days, when I could beat you in the last. You will not deny that, Tom.- / "I met Betsey Brown in the street yester- day. Years have not added to her charms, and an awful poke-bonnet did not set off to advantage the few which nature has given \.               *   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   115 to her. I shook hands with her, and, giving her a dollar, told her it was from you; no falsehood that, for you remember that you left ten dollars in trust for me to give to the poor, saying--superstitious fellow that you are!- that it might bring you good luck. My grandfather would tell you not to trust to your good works in that sort of fashion. It would have done you good, could you have seen Betsey's delight. "'May I buy "Robinson Crusoe"?' she said. 'Tom lent it to me once, and I liked it very much.' "'No,' said I; 'buy a new bonnet, and I will give you my ' Robinson Crusoe."' "There! the clock is striking eleven, and I must go to bed. I hear my mother's step on the stairs. She is coming to tuck me up in bed and say 'good-night,' as she used to do when I was a little shaver.   What a blessing these mothers are to us rough fel-  IX,     "6    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, lows! I tell you, Tom, the thought of my mother has kept me from going wrong when I have been sorely tempted. There! she is at my door. Good-night, Tom. "Yours truly,    tI "JOHN GRANT." Mrs. Grant had sought John's room, that, like many other fond mothers, she might have him wholly to herself awhile. They talked together for half an hour with that confidence which a young man who has not lost his love of home feels towards his best earthly friend.  How many a business man, fretted with the perplexities of life, longs for such an hour-an hour of love and confidence which heaven alone can give him. John slept that night as if fanned by angel wings. No dark dream disturbed his rest; no shadow of a coming sorrow darkened the brightness of his spirit.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   117 The next day John visited the bank. - Ned was very busy, but his father opened a door into a pleasant, sunny room whichh- had been newly paintedcand furnished in modernl style. "This was Ned's idea," said his father. "It had never occurred to me that it looked old and shabby. I have an attachment to old things, I believe; but Ned is for having the establishment look 'cspectable.  Come and see our new safe. This is one of Ned's notions too, and he was right in this. I wonder we ever trusted our money in that old affair. This is burglar-proof; no powder or chisel can open it." As he spoke, he threw open the heavy, double iron doors. "Examine 'the lock and key, Johnnie - a triumph of human ingcenuity--one chance in two millions for a thief's getting the right number!"              John looked a moment at the specie and bills in the safe, and then turned his atten- *"'   "8      CAPTAIN JOHN. tion to the lock. Now, John was gifted with mechanical ingenuity. He :stood over the lock for some minutes. His father and old 'Squire Brown were in the room, and one or two doing business with Ned at the counter, but within hearing. John was is a brown study for a while. At last he said,- "Father, I thinlr I could pick that lock." "Ay, John, that is the first word- which you have said that reminds me you are now a sophomore." "Try it," said Ned, who had heard the conversation. "I will giye you fifty dollars if you succeed." "I do not fancy the business," said John. "At any rate, we will defer it till after dinner," said his father. "Come, John, it is just the minute for me to leave the bank." They walked home together.    CHAPTER IV. John's Vacation. - Burning of the old Meeting-house-. -A beau- tiful Day m Oldbury. HOME was never more delightful to John than during this vacation. Every day brought its pleasure, even the hour in which he read Greek with Grandfather Fletcher; at that time the old gentleman renewed- his youth, and John found the Greek Testament a new book, - a very wonderful book it seemed to him, as he read it in that noble old language. In his own house, Mary, quiet and undemon- strative, was all the tim'e silently studying' her brother's happiness. Emily was with them a great deal of the time, making the (119)   120     CAPTAIN JOHN; on, house vocal with her music,- the one talent which Aunt Esther spared no means within her power to cultivate, because it was the  gift of God.' Her voice was one of those sweet contraltos that make you feel that you, are floating upwards on wings of angels. Her singing'was natural, and therefore sim- ple; did not tremble and quaver as if her voice had had an attack of palsy; . nor did she pronounce common English words in singing as if they were made up of French- "r'S ,and " a's." Aunt Esther had a great dislike to what she termed operatic music; though never having attended the opera, she must havo referred only to the music common among schoolgirls--a paste imitation of the pure diamond. "I like such music," the old lady would say, "as I do artificial flowers; some of them are very beautiful, especially those made of wax, but I prefer the old-fashioned ?i   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   121 garden pinks and roses. The heights and depths of that wonderful instrument-the hullman voice -- astonish me; so does the rush of the steam engine; -but the flight of a bird through the air pleases me more. These unknown tongues in music are no more profitable than they were in prophe- Sying among the early Christians." And so it came to pass, that when Emily sung hymns old ladies had no need of hymn- books, for the words came out pure and sweet as chime bells in the morning air. To John, -whose music was all in his heart, with not a particle on toncue and lips, the simple ballads which she sung, were very charming. But Ned was a musician, sung well, and played skilfully on the flute. He preferred the compositions of Beethoven and Mozart; and here Emily delighted to fol- low, and as she progressed in her music learned to love more deeply the intricate,   122    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, harmonious, and w-onderful combinations of the Gernman masters. Almost the only thinor ;which could win Ned from the solitude of - his own room was the pleasure of Emily's mullsic. One evening, only three days before the time set for John's return to college, a small partJy was collected in the parlor and Emily was at the piano. Mrs. Grant missed Ned - and soughlt him in his room. He was busy writinl, and was evidentlyr annoyed with the illterruplltioll, for he gathered his papers has- tily together and swept them from the table. He was pale and tired. "Come, Nedl, bringo your flute; we miss you below. This is John's last evening with the young, people, for you know he goes to Boston to-morrow to spelnd a day with his uncle, and returns to college on Monday." "I will come down soon, mother; in fif- teen minutes, at most," replied Ned.   "OSS. IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   123 As soon as his mother closed the door Ned" locked his papers in a little hand trunk, then opened the windclow and smolked a cigar, after which the dressing-gown was exchangyed for a handsome coat, anld he appeared in the parlor the most graceful of all the young men in Olcdbury. His rich bass voice min- gling, w+ith Emily's -sweet tones made rare music. The evening was a little cool and a fire was bulrning on the hearlth. Grandfatlher Fletcher sat in his arm-chair luxuriating in the hviluth and music. The flickliering blaze of the walnut wood played light and shad- ows on his large, noble face, on which there rested a glow of peace as if the heart were at. rest. The light too cldancecld over the young, girls in bright dresses and smiling faces . Opposite the old  gentleman was Aunt Esther in her gray silk and cap of soft   124     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, lace, smilingc benignantly down upon the youllng folks.  Mr. Grnllt stood near the piano, looking round upon the guegsts with great-plceasure, and perhaps some pride as his eyes rested on his own children,--the elder son, upon whose shoulders he was- now throwing some. of his business cares; the gentle Mary whom   everybody loved, and, that evening, longest upon the round, merry face of John, who could hardly be called any more " our homely boy," for there was already in his face a good promise for the future. Grandclfther too was looking iat that face; "a real Grant face,"' he said to himself; and when Aunt Esther moved her chair toward him he spoke his thought aloud. "Do you think so, Miss Esther?" "Yes, decidedly; John is a Grant. It is singular how faces are reproduced after two generations. There was in my grandfather's house a portrait of one of our ancestors [you   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   125 know my mother was a Grant] who was a stern old covenanter in the days of Knox, and gave up all his possessions rather than submit to worship save according to the dic- tates of his own conscience.  His resem- blance to our John is so marked that I proposed to dress the boy in the costume of his ancestor the other day in a tableau, and the resemblance was so strikiing that it seemed as if the picture had stepped out of the frame." "The Grants are of good old Scotch blood," said the old gentleman, "and I am glad if John inherits the traits of his an- cestors; it is good stuff to make scholars and martyrs. Our family are from the old cavaliers of Ecngland. We trace our ances- try back, I believe, for many generations, but I know the genealogy only as far back as the reign of Charles the Second, to one of that vicious court. However, two hun-   126    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, dred years in New England have purified the stock, I hope. Edward Grant inherits the beauty of that branch of his family. Do you see the faultless contour of the face, the finely-cut nostril, and the haughty curve of the lip?" "Yes," said Aunt Esther; "Ned has a proud turn of the head, and carries him- self as if all the blood of those haughty cavaliers coursed through his veins." "He does not-show this trait in his busi- ness, I believe," said the old gentleman, a little anxiously. "Oh no," said Aunt Esther; "his reserve pleases our-cautious old business men. Ned, is a remarkable young man, they say.   I cannot judge myself, for he never comes to see me, and few young men in town are as great strangers to me as Ned." "John Grant is happy in his family,'but after all, Miss Esther, I think I take as   "OSS IS SOMETIME GAIN.   127 much comfort with Willie as with any of my grandchehiren. He seems to me, thoughl of the earth, not earthy. He lives in music, and sometimes I think he will pass away on the breath of music to heaven.  Lo'ok at him nolw. He sat with his ear turned toward Emily, who was playing something from Mozart's requiem, and his face was calm and sad as the strains that floated to his ear. When Emily finished he played, improvising some- thng as he often did, but filling every lis- tener with sweet sadness. His long, thin fingers were very flexible, and -his touch was exquisite.; but he was so pale and delicate that one felt as if the tie was very slender which bound him to earth. When the party separated, John drove his , grandfather and Willie home; and the last words which the old gentleman said were, - ' Do not fail to be here on Sunday even-   128    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, ing, Johnnie; we shall see you at tea. I have much to say to you before you return to college." "I will not forget, grandpa.' "I shall think of it every hour till then," said Willie. It was Thursday evening. There was a full moon and a cloudless sky. The giant ellns clasped their pliant boughs above the rider's head, and made a quiverning tracery of leaves, through which the moonlight gleamed and the pale stars peeped. It was late. The dwellers in those beautiful homes on the Ridge slumbered, while the shadows of the dark evergreens lay' on the green sward, and the rich autumn flowers drank in fresh beauty from the dewy night. Late as was the hour, John drove slowly; for the peace of the great night overshadowed him. For the first time since he read those words in his grandfather's garden recurred   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   129 to him--"always tender, always strong, giving his life for his race." "I shall never come up to that ideal," he said to himself; "and- yet I want to be a true man, and do good work in this world. I never can be contented, much as I love the dear old town, to sit down here all my days and live an easy life. I would not be Ned, handsome as he is, to stay in that bank, counting money all my days.   No; I want to do something worth living for. I am strong, and want to use my strenlth.  I must go through college, and then we will see. I wonder if Emily likes money. I don't care for it much; not quite so much as for honor. I would rather be Coesar in Gaul than Croesus in Spain. But grandpa says there was never any true greatness among men without suf- fering. I suppose he calls Paul more of a hero than Caesar, and Luther than Bonaparte. I do not quite see it; and yet there is some-   130    CAPTAIN JOHN;. O, thing glorious in dying for others. Curtius threw himself into the great gulf that opened in the heart of Rome for his country-' ten- der and strong'--dying to save men, fling- ing aside glory and wealth to save sinners! I must look into this subject a little. Pro- fessor S-- said, the other night, that the highest style of man was a Christianll." As he thus mused the clock struck twelve - the old town clock-faint and dclistant, but John counted the strokes; then the' Old South counted the hours of the dead day; then the North church, with sweeter voice; while, before she had finished, the Middle church, whose graceful spire John saw before him, pointing heavenwards, took up the dirge for another day lost in eternity. Just at that moment, John saw flashes of red light flick- ering. and dancing on the broad street and on the sides of the houses. He sprang from the carriage. The old church which he had ?   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN-   131 passed not tell minutes before was on fire, ancl the forked flames were creeping like fiery serpents over the roof, and writhing roind the tall spire which had been for a hundred years the landmark of the sailor. It must have been a splendid sight at that moment to the seamen who were making for shore at that time. John cried "Fire!" till the sound rang along the street and roused the sleepers, who needed but one glance from their windows to know the doom of the ancient church. The moon sailed on in silent majesty; but the billows of flame rolled over the doomed church, and, like angry  breakers, tossed their red foam into the midnight air. John was driving rapidly to his father's house, when he met Robert, the watchman of the ballk, at the corner of State street. "Oh, Master John I the meeting-house is . ,\   132    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, all on fire, and my mother lives in a little house near by. What shall I do?" "But you have left the bank, Robert. Are you sure that you locked the doors?" "I believe so; but here are the keys, I must go to my mother." John took the keys and drove to the bank, found it unlocked, and a light burningo within. There was, by this time, a great commotion in, the street, for the whole town was thor- oughly roused. It was rather hard for John to remain idle there. He would have preferred to fight the fire on the roof of the burning church. He had been there nearly an hour, by the count- ing-room clock, when his father appeared. "Thank you, Johnnie, for taking Robert's place; though his mother was in no more danger than a clam in a snow-squall. Jump into the carriage now, and see the last of the old church."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   133 John was glad to be released. What boy of sixteen does not enjoy the excitement of a fire? There is something in the fierceness and rage of fire that drives a man to super- human exertion. The fire had done its worst when John got to the scene. The bell had tolled its own death-knell that night; and when the red serpent touched it with its fangs, the heart that had beaten for a century broke, and was silent for all time. It was four o'clock in the morning when John found himself in his room, and tired enough to sleep soundly, which he did till ten o'clock the next morning. He found his mother waiting to breakfast with him. The chicken and buckwheat cakes were very wel- ,come to John; but the best part of his mother's breakfast was the round, smilingl face- of John. She was pronud of Ned's beauty and talent, but the happy, impulsive   134     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, John was her youngest and perhaps her favorite child; at least, he--was very near her heart.   ' \, "Your -father wished. you to call at the bank before goingr to the station," said Mrs. Grant. "May will wallk with me," replied John; -,      - and just then his sister appeared, dressed for her walk. "Will you be here in the seven o'clock train to-morrow??" asked his mother. \ "Without fail, H trust, mother. Good morning!"' and, with a parting kiss, he left her standing at the door. Mrs. Grant watched him till he was out of sight. Coming events do not always cast their shadows before.  Presentiments are oftener recalled after a sad event than per- ceived as forewarningfs. It is generally the nervous and ignorant, and those whose hearts-   "OSS IS SOM3IETIMES GAIN.   135 are not stayed upon God, that are troubled with dreams and omens. When Johnl and Mary had turned the corner of the street, Mrs. Grant closed the door, and thanked God in her heart for the blessing of husband and children, as she busied herself in her household affairs. Now and then she sang, in a low voice, the hymn commencing, - "Nearer, my God, to thee, 1 Nearer to thee. Even though it be a. cross that raiseth me. Still all my song shall be, Nearer; my God, to thee, Nearer to thee." Emily had sung it the evening before, and the melody seemed floatting ill the parlor still, where Mrs. Grant was busy.  Again and again she sang it, catching almost, as it seemed to her, the music in the air. We often sing it, forgetting the burden of the song-prayer.   136     CAPTAIN JOIN,; Olt, Mary and John cntered the inner room of the bank just at half past eleven. The noon train left Oldbury at twelve, and the station was about five minutes' walk fromn the bank. "Here is some money for you, John. Will twenty dollars be enough for' you to pay for the 'sights,' and to buy pickled limes and gibraltars?" These articles were John's delight in his schoolboy days. It was a common joke in the family, that Johnnie's pennies were all, invested in them. "There will be more than' I shall need," said John, " unless you wish to order a pound or two of checkerberry lozengles." "Ay, Johnnie, you'll never forget your' father's weak points."  His father was very fond o0f these lozenges, and the son well remembered that he never explored his father's pockets in former days without finding some.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   137 "Well, I like them still," said Mr. Grant. "They have a waft of the green woods about them." Just at that moment, old 'Squire Brown, the same person that John met the day pre- vious, came in Qnl some business which re- quired immediate attention ; and John passed into the outer room, where Ned was cashingo a check for Dr. Mann. Tom White, over- seer of one of the woollen mills, was stand- ilg, at the counter with a check in his hand. Mrs. Moody, an aged widow, was seated in a chair, talking with little Bob White, who held a soiled ten'-dollar bill in his hand. "I came in to see if it is counterfeit," he said. "Ned Grant always knows 'em." Mrs. M-oody was waitingl for her dividends. John spoke to' all present, and had said "good morllning" to Ned, when the latter handed him a package. "Will you take this to the Traders' Bank, in Boston, John?"   -138    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  John took it in his hand, and went out with Mary. It lacked but five minutes of the time for the train to start, and they walked rapidly. It was just ready to move as John sprang into a car and gave May a hurried good-bye. "Talke good care of the package," said Mary. John replied, "I wish Ned hadn't troubled me with it; but I shall not forget." The whistle sounded. John nodded gaily to his sister from the window, and the train moved on, slowly at first; then the loungers disappeared from the depot, the hot breath of the engine cooled itself in the fresh air, and the train rolled on with increased speed, bearing its burden of living beings, with all their joys and sorrows, their hopes and fears, their loves and hates. .I said living beings- no, not all. Just as May and John came in sight of the depot that morning, they saw a   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   139 coffin carefully deposited in the baggage car. Johnl shuddered. He was so full of life and hope and joy, the young  blood coursing through his veins, the world before him bright as the glad  perspective of Cole's picture of youth, the thought of death sent a chill to his heart. But perchance the dead man lying there so mute and peaceful amid the noise and tumult of the rushing  train, deaf to the shrill whistle, unmoved by fear of coming danger, was more blessed  than them all; more to be envied than the fair girl of eighteen summers who was going to the city to buy her weddingl trousseau; or the rich merchant counting his gains; more to be envied perhaps than our smiling, round- faced John to whom the world looked so bright. The boy himself thought so before the week was out, and wondered that he should   "O    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, think death so horrible a thing. He settled himself in his seat glad to be the only occu-' pant, deposited the package of money in his travelling bag, and placed that between him- self anid the window. A woman sat in front of him with an immense chignon of coarse, false hair which amused John, reminding him by contrast of Emily's smooth, nat- ural braids and Stella's curls. Most of the people were strangers. It was not a train usually taken by Oldbury people, and most of the travellers were tick- eted from Portland to Boston. John had bought a newspaper, as boys are apt to do in imitation of men; but he cared little to read it, for every bit of the, road was asso- ciated with the pleasant days of his child- hood. It was partly on the line of the old post-road. He had been all over the woods for nuts and birds, and on the salt-marshes to get a shot at the wild ducks that abound   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAp.   141 in them. Tom 'Wood was associated with every spot of meadow or woodland on the road. He resolved that he would have a vacation when Tom came home, if he had to study nights to keep up with his class. As the train neared Salem he grew sleepy. He was always a good sleeper;  The con- ductor, who was an old acquaintance, said to him, when he saw him nodding,-- "Come inuto my room and take a nap.", John was only too glad of the chance. Taki:ngc his carpet-bag he followed the con- ductor into a small room partitioned off from the baggage-car, where there was a lounge, onl which John threw himself, using his bag for a pillow. Here he slept soundly till the conductor, who had been busy in another part of the train, wakened him, saying,- "You must have a good conscience, John, for you sleep like a dormouse. I have given you half a dozen shakes."    "2    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, John roused himself, found his carpet-bag safe, and, taking it up, said, - "Are we in?" "Been in for five minutes," said the conl ductor; "if you wish for a carriage you must speak quick." "What do I want of a carriage?" asked John, as he jumped up, shook himself, and then stood firm and, square upon his short, sturdy legs. "Much obliged to you, Mr. Prescott; I did not sleep more than two or three hours last night on account of the fire, and I feel all the better for my nap. What is your return train to-morrow?" "Ten to five." "I shall be on that. Good morning, sir." He walked on, bag in hand, along Cause- way, through School, into Washington, and from thence to State, where he found the bank. He saw the cashier, whom he knew   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   143 by sight, and who was a native of Oldbury. The teller and two clerks were present. ' He;,e is a package of money which my father wished me to hand you, Mr. Phillips." "Is that you, Johnnie?" said the latter, kindly. "You are grown so that I hardly know you. Will you take a seat?" "No, thank you; I am in great haste." John was afraid he would be late to his uncle's dinner, which was served punctually at three o'clock, and therefore sprung into a horse-car' and rode to Chester square, where we will leave him for a short time to enjoy the hospitality of his friends, and return to Oldbury. It was five minutes to one by the bank clock, and five minutes to one by the old clock in the hall at the Robins' Nest, and five minutes to one by the chronometer watch.  This latter was the medium by which the two clocks, kept apart by the    [44    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  force of circumstances, were known still to beat in unison. Mr. Grant was drawing on  I his thin, fall overcoat. He was a careful man in all his, ways. "Ned, did you send that package of money to Phillips?" "Yes, sir; John took it." "John!  You should not have troubled John with it; he is young and careless, not used to handling money. Why didn't you send it by express?" "I was too late for the express, sir. The fire disturbed us all this morning." "True, true; but I wish you had waited." "You said it must go to-day, sir." "Not by John. I am sorry. You know what a forgetful child he used to be,. Per- haps he has grown more careful." As Mr. Grant walked home the matter troubled him.  John's mind was not on business; likely as not -he would leave the      ,   rzIOO -L OMETIMES GAIN.  145 money in the cars. He thought of it all through his dinner, though he did not speak of the matter to his wife. The clock struck two just as Mr. Grant was taking off his overcoat in the bank, and the old clock in the hall struck two also; but they could not hear each other. No matter; they are both faithful to their trust, and sometime, mayhap, in the distant future, they may meet in the old 'homestead and spend  their old age together.  Ned sits writing. He  has not been home to his dinner. He had planned a ride for the af- ternoon, and remained to gain time. It was no uncommon thing for him to go without his dinner. He   was never a gourmand; neither could John be called such, but the latter wanted his three meals per day, and a lunch extra did not come amiss. \ He was always hungry when the breakfast bell rung; never lacked an appetite for dinner; and as 10  .   "6    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, for supper, he insisted upon it that he slept all the better for the bowl of bread and milk which Bridget always brought him in the evening. Ned, on the other hand, was fastidious and delicate, frequently absenting himself from table. While he sat writing Robert' came round with the horse and chaise. "I am  glad to see you talring a little amusement, Ned," said his father.  "You confine yourself too closely to business." Ned brushed his hat and overcoat, stood a moment at the glass adjusting his cravat and collar. A handsome young manl was Ned Grant when he stepped into the chaise that afternoon and rode along the Ridge, and northward to the village of Belleville, rightly named, with its wealth of trees, its fire old houses and ample gardens; on, across the Chain Bridge, and through the pine woods to the old country road. Ned   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   147 was alone. He preferred to ride by him- self, for he generally connected business with pleasure. He rode slowly, charmed perhaps by the quiet beauty of the day. It was one of those rare days which the year holds in reserve for this golden month. The air was mild as that of a June day, while a soft mist like a veil of gauze rested on the ,distant hills, and an odor of ripened fruit filled the atmosphere. The foliage was richer than the robes of an eastern king. The trees have a wonderful secret, which they never reveal to man, of gathering from the sun her rainbow tints, and from the earth the hues of all precious stones. The sky wore a soft, tender hue, as if broodingh over the world in love.   Everything conspired that day to soothe troubled hearts, to quiet restless nerves, and harmonize all discords. Old people and invalids came out to breathe the air that brought healing on its wings,   "8    CAPTAIN JOHN ; OR, and to see the foliage in its autumnal beauty. Auntie Cook from the workhouse hobbled over to Aunt Esther's to get a few sweet apples. She found Aunt Sabre gathering what remained of sage and parsley and thyme in the garden, and there the poor widow had a chance to rest in the summer- house and tell over the sad story of her sor- rows. Aunt Sabre heard it for perhaps the hundredth time, but she remembered Him who never grew weary of our complaints, and listened and comforted not only with kind words, but sweet apples and anise cordial. Betsey Brown was picking apples in Mr. Grant's orchard, selecting specimens of each for her little garret room. When Aunt Esther rose that morning and, saw how brightly the sun shone in at the east windows, and felt the soft air, she said to herself, "Lottie Smith must ride out to- *   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   149 day; it will do the poor invalid a world of good." Therefore she ordered a horse and chaise and drove round herself for the sick girl. Then she remembered the widow Hart who had lost her husband, and sat in her darkened chamber weeping all day lono. No one but Aunt Esther could have won her out, bult who could resist the dear old lady? Mrs. Hart did come out into the air and sunshine, and Aunt Esther talked to her of the beauty of the trees and tnle glory of earth and sky; of the resurrection of the planted seed, and the spring that comes after the winter, till the heart-broken widow felt- that death is but the law of nature and good, because ordained by infinite Wisdom; and then she began dimly to see that- "Lifeis ever lord of death, And love can never lose its own." She slept sweetly that night and dreamed of heaven.   150    CAPTAIN JOHN;i OR, Mrs. Grant was almost the only one in Oldbury who did not much regard the beauty of the day. Once, to be sure, as the porch. door stood open and the sunlight streamed into the kitchen, she said to Bridclget, - "I am glad that John has such a fine day.'" "Yes, ma'am; it is like the weather we had in the ould country; like Killaloe, ma'am." Mrs. Grant smiled. What higher com- pliment could Bridget pay to the weather. Mrs. Grant spent her time in John's room, looking over his clothes, sewing on buttons, and taking a stitch here and there as was needed; then she packed a little trunk, placing in it some gift from each member of the family; and after locking the trunk, she wrote on the outside, "Not to be opened till John is iln his rooms at, college." The work made her happy, and the little device about the trunk set her fancy to work- in   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    151 planning John's future. She was in a fairy land where the flowers were fairies and the sunshine brighter than in the actual world around her. Mary and Stella Drummond were sewing in the observatory.  They could see the beach through the telescope, and watch the waves as they came and went in calm, sweet order that day; the lighthouses, with their white robes and black head-dresses; the fleet of fishing vessels off the coast, looking like a flock of geese disporting themselves in the water, and a vessel making for port. Turn- ing the telescope landward, the eye rested on a range of low, wooded hills, where the trees were still in full leafage, the crimson and gold of the maples mingling with the deep green of pine and hemlock, "There," said Stella, "I do not believe it is right to sew when there is so much beauty to look at. I am going to sit still and enjoy A                 n   152'     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  this glorious picture. I wish I could ex- press my thoughts inl poetry; do, May, repeat. some. I neverl can recall any when I feel that I should enjoy it most." "I was thinking,' said May, "of some lines of Scott, as I looked upon the trees; but he applied them to Melrose, I believe: "Oh for that pencil erst profuse Of chivalry's emblazoned hues; That traced of old in Woodstock bower The pageant of the leaf and flower.'- FEmily will sing to us just a little." Without   any  other reply Emily com- menced- "'-Oh, Brignal banks are wild and fair, And Greta woods are green; And you may gather garlands there Would grace a summer queen.' " She stopped.    May finished the verse, re- peating  it almost as sweetly as Emily had Bung it:   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   153 "And as I rode by Dalton hall, Beneath the turret high, A maiden on the castle wall Was singing merrily.'" The afternoon was. waning. Already the sun had left the sea-beach in shadow, and was resting above the low range of hills in the west. Grandfather Fletcher rested in an arm-chair in the yard, just outside his door. His broad-brimmed hat was on his head, and his staff by his side. The door was open into the hall, and from that was an entrance to the parlor, where Willie sat playing sweet, plaintive music, beautiful as the dying day. The setting sun gilded the windows of the old library, and threw a mellow light on the dark wainscoting and on the old folios in their antique bindings. The housekeeper, in her short gown and stuff petticoat, her gray hair parted under a broad-frilled cap, came out to water some linen whitening on the grass.   154    CAPTAN JOHN; OR, "I reckon we shall have a storm after this. Such a deep blue sky as this changes quickly to gray." "Let us enjoy it while it lasts, Ruth," said the old gentleman, "and bear the- storm bravely when it comes." "Hark!" said she; " don't you hear the low sighing of the sea? That is. whispering wind. We must gather the 'pound sweet- in's' to-morrow, or they will be ruined by the storm." "You are right, Ruth," said the old gentle- man. "But I like to forget, on such a day as this, that storms must come." "Tea is ready," said Ruth. The old gentleman took off his hat, and smoothed the stray white locks upon his forehead. As he did so, a slanting beam of sunlight fell upon his venerable head, and lighted up the serene old face. There was not one cloud in that sunset sky              .^ . .    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   155 to foretell the coming storm which Ruth feared, or the fiercer tempest which fate had in store for the good old man. I wrote the word fate, so prone are we to use words lightly--we, who believe firmly that no storm comes but by His will who holds the winds and waves in his hand, and that the sorrows of God's children are only the shad- ows with which the loving artist makes his work more perfect; only the dark thread in life's web, which will be seen hereafter lecessary to the strength and beauty of the material. We left Mr. Grant in the bank. He had little idea of the beauty of the day; for the sun enters the rooms of money-changers reluctantly, and never lingers long. Gold and silver and bank-notes are to be hidden away; and a bank architect usually studies how much sunlight he can keep out, with due regard to comfort.   156    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Mr. Grant had been alone in the bank. He had said to himself once or twice, "I trust that Lackage is safe. Jack is such a careless little fellow! If it were Ned, I should have no fear. There was a difference in the boys. John never cared much for accumulating money, though he liked well enough to spend it." As he walked home, the beauty of the day stole upon his pre- ooccupied mind. He entered the hall, and compared his watch with the old sentinel in the corner. Right, to a second! "Mollie," he called to his wife, who had heard his step, and came from John's room to meet him - "Mollie, will you take a walk with me this evening? '" The wife was too busy in finishing a dress- ing-gown for John to walk out. Mr. Grant then whnt to the ship-yard, to see a vessel of large size on the stocks. There he met   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    157 some old friends who had come for the same, purpose.   ' The tea hour at home was seven o'clock. At half past six, Mr. Grant left the yard to go to his house. He had gone but a few steps, when he was met by a' telegraph messenger, who handed him the following telegram: - 'BOSTON, Oct. 6. - TRADERS' BANK. "Come on, if possible, in the next train. Important business. E. G. PHTTLTMTPS." There I just as I feared! Jack has lost that money-the first time during my con- nection with the bank that such a misfortune has occurred." The next train left at ten minutes to seven. He had no time to go home.    He walked   158.     CAPTAIN JOHN. rapidly to the depot, and wrote a note to his wife, stating that business called him to Boston in the evening train, and that he should' return in the morining. Mrs. Grant was neither surprised nor alarmed. It was no- uncommon event for her husband to go to the city in haste; and she, calm aicnd with a heart full of peace toward. God and man, retired to her room for the iiglt. She never slept without a fervent prayer for her husband and children. When she prayed for them that night, no shadow of coming evil darkened the pathway of light that led heavenward; no fear, even of dan- ger, as she afterwards said, disturbed her spirit; but, as she opened the window and looked out into the calm night, a murmured thanksgiving went up to God for her bless- ings. -A narrow gleam of light lay on the green sward from Ned's lamp, as she drew her curtain, and a pleasant feeling of security O   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   159 that he was near, in the absence of her husband, was only natural to a mother. We have been thus minute in our descrip- tion of this October day and of the friends of this family. It was the last day of peace for many of them for long, weary years -a day remembered for its loveliness; but never more came back to them the "tender grace" of that autumn day.   CHAPTER V. A North-east Storm.-John accused of Theft.-Trial and Im- prisonment.  THE cashier of the Traders' Bank was a cautious man; a man of slow temperament and quiet nerves. He was never in haste, never absent- minded.- His books were kept with faultless neatness; but though he had been connected' with the bank for many years; he was almost as slow as a schoolgirl in reachn a column of figures, and no pressure of business could induce him to quicken his footsteps. When John handed him the package, he glanced at the amount on the wrapper, held it in his hand till he had finished talking with a gen- "  -  (160) O    Oh John my boy, you have come at last. Page 96'i     I       LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    161 tleman at his desk, and then sat down to examine its contents. The others might have deposited it in the safe till a more convenient time. The monoey   was in one-hundred-dollar packages. Of course, there should have been fifty of these. There were that num- ber of packages, but on examination ten of these were of tissue paper of the same weight and size as those containing the money. The two clerks and the teller were present, and exchanged significant glances as they saw Mr. Pbillips counting the money with so much deliberation.  His caution was a mat- ter of joke in the bank.  This time he counted and re-counted, and examined the outside of the wrapper, on which was writ- ten, in the large, bold hand of Mr. Grant, "Five thousand dollars [$5,000.00] ." "Four thousand, and no more," said Mr. Phillips. "Hall, look here," turning to the teller, who, e    162    CAPTAIN JOHN; O R, by the way, had seen that there was some- thing wrong. '"Ben," (to one of the clerks,) "bring me Mr. Grant's letter received from Phoenix Bank, Oldbuiy, this morning." It was brought.  The contents were as follows: MR. KNAPP:- "Dear Sir: I send you five thousand dol- lars [$5,000] by- this morning's express-- balance due for Massachusetts 'sixes' which, I purchased for the Home Manufacturing Company. Please appropriate accordingly. "Yours respectfully, "JOSEPH GRANT." "Now, look here, all of you," said Mr. Knapp to the two clerks and teller. It was time to close the bank; but the cashier or- dered the gas lighted, and the three men remained with closed doors, and each counted   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   163 the contents of the package, and came to the same result. A fraud had been committed. "This was not sent by express," said Hall; "a young fellow brought it whom you recog- nized as Grant's son." "Yes, yes; I remember now. It was not Ned, whom you all know, but a younger son -a college student." The clerks smiled. They knew something of college students, and sharel the prejudice, too common among clerks, toward them. Suspicion fastened upon John. Mr. Phillips' mind moved slowly.    It, was some time before it occurred to him to telegraph to Mr. Grant. "The fellow has probably not left the city," said Hall. "I suggest that we put the police on his track, and bring him here to meet his father." Mr. Phillips assented, while he telegraphed to Oldbury.    164    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, At' this time, John was eating his dinner at his uncle's table in Chester Square, utterly unconscious of the commotion concerning  him. "What is your plan for amusement to- day?" his uncle asked. "I want to go on board the United States man-of-war in the Charlestown: Navy Yard first, and this evening to the Museum." "Still fond of the sea!" said his uncle. "I had hoped that college life cured you of this folly." "It never will," said John. I mean to go through college now that I have entered; but I prefer the sea, and often wish that I was with Tom Wood." "It is a pity," said his uncle, "that you had not gone before the mast for one, year before enteringscollege. It would have cured you of this folly." "It has not cured Tom, uncle."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   165 John left the house immediately after din- ner, with the intention of takling the Navy Yard cars at the Charlestown railroad depot in Cambridge street, having promised to be at home to tea, and take his cousin Mary, a girl of twelve, to the Museum. 'He went to' the depot, and had whistled for a car which had already started, when a familiar face looked out at him from the window of another car. It was that of his chum, Halford. The car was stopped, and the next minute the boys were wallking arm   in arm. Halford was pale and thin. "I am so glad to meet you, John!" he said.  'Will you go with me to Somerville? Father is in New York, and my mother is ill. WVe received a telegranm from the doctor at Somerville this morninbg. My brother is not as well; not violent, but weak and evidently failing. I shall be very glad if you can go with me.   166    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, We may need to telegraph to father, and perhaps you will do it for me." John assented without a moment's hesita- tion, forgetting the man-of-war in his friend's troubles. Halford had not enjoyed his vacation. His 'father had been absent most of the time, and his mother, overwhelmed by the terrible calamity which had fallen upon her eldest son, seldom left her room, and Fred was fearful that she would never be well again. "Oh, Johnnie I you cannot tell how I have envied you-your rides and parties, and the society of your sister and that Stella whom you think so charming, and the other one who sings so finely - what is her name?" "Emily." "Your cousin, I believe?" "Yes; I call her my cousin, though she is only a distant relation of the family." "I have not been to a sail or a party or an A     .      ,    \   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  167 evening visit during the vacation. Mother cannot bear to have me out of her sight; and while she is so feeble and nervous, I cannot deny her, though it is rather hard on a fellow to be told all the time of the talents and goodness of his elder brother, and not one word of praise for himself. I wish I could be in. your place for one year. It would be no more than fair, I think." "You must come to Oldbury next vaca- tion," said John, "and we will keep you busy enough, on sea and land. Poor old fellow!" he added; you will knot be fit to study when you return." "That is just what I shall be ready to do," said Halford. Once back again in the old rooms with you, Jack, with your jolly, round face before me, I shall be happy enough." "Well, I shall be on hand Monday," said John.  "Look out for me," said Halford; "unless,"   168    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, he added, sadly, "there is a change for the worse in brother Charles. O dear! I feel as if there was trouble ahead for me." "Poh! poh!" said John. "You have been shut up at home so long that you are nervous and low-spirited. Wait till next week, and then I will shake you up I " As, the two boys walked up- the asylum hill, they were both silent. It was only two years since Fred's brother had graduated with the highest honors of his 'class, and had entered himself as a student at Cambridge Law School only a few weeks afterward. He was known there as a brilliant scholar and a courteous, amiable man. The terrible disease, now'so common, and which seems to take for its victims the weakest ancl the strongest minds, came on slowly. Hetwas bewildered at first by the strange failure of memory, and by turns of absent-mindedness; but he went on with his studies, never- sus-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES, GAIN.   169 pecting his danger. The warning shadows of this disease are as little heeded as the first light, fleecy clouds that precede the summer storm. When the boys entered the little room where the poor sufferer had endured the ter- rible torture which sometimes accompanies that disease, they, both of them, feared to enter; but when the door was opened, they found all quiet. The room was darkened, and the young man lay on the white, dra- peried couch with a worn face, white almost as the sheet that lay unruffled before him, and on which his long, thin hands rested. One of the attendant physicians sat beside him, administering some medicine. The sick man recognized his brother, and a smile lighted his features as he raised his hand feebly and extended it toward him. Fred looked a moment at the calm face, at   170     CAPTAIN JOHN;- OR, the hair, white almost as that of a man of seventy, and burst into tears. "Do not be' troubled, Fred. I am going where the weary are at rest.  I am  not afraid. I trust in Him who -died for me,- for us all, Fred,; and I am so glad to go- so glad, Fred!" Fred Halford sat down by his brother's side, while the attendant motioned John from the room, and informed him that this calm interval would not last long. It was very rare in these cases. If it continued, the patient might not live many hours. "We must telegraph to his father." John left the house at once for this pur- pose. He was absent about half an hour. When he returned, the sufferer was dying. He sank into his last sleep like a tired child who lays his head upon his mother's bosom, and closes his eyes with a sense of perfect/ security.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   171 Fred begged John not to leave him. The latter had not thought of doing so. Every- thing else was forgotten in the trouble of his friend. It never occurred to him till near morning that his uncle's family would be anxious about him. He, resolved as soon as possible to take an early car, ride over to the city and inform his friends what had happened, and return at once to his friend. He did so, promising Fred that he would return and- stay with - him till his father came.  John had not slept during the night, nor had he eaten any breakfast.  It was not strange that he looked haggard and worn; he was not accustomed to watching or fast- ing. He intended to take a bath and break- fast, and return to aid Fred during the day. What was his astonishment, on ringing the bell, to find a police officer in the hall, who said, after a searching glance at him, -   172    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "This is the young man, if I am not mistaken." At the same moment, his father came from the drawing-room into the hall, looking ten years older than when John parted from him only the day before; John. looked from one to the other, in mute astonishment. He could not speak, but his face said plainly, "What can this mean?" His father neither spoke nor moved, but stood as if suddenly stricken to stone. He fully expected, when he saw his son, to find his innocence written upon his face. He could not believe him guilty of theft, though careless he knew him to be from childhood; but when he saw that haggard face and un- combed hair, and knew that he had been out all night, the father's heart died within him, and he gave a groan that pierced John to the heart. It nerved him, however, to speech. "Fa-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  1 ther! father! speak to me. What terrible thing has happened? Is mother"- "dead," he was going to say. Nothing but that could have changed his father thus, he thought; but he could not speak that word. The very thought made him faint and sick. His father finished the sentence for him: "'Dead?' were you going to say? Dead! I wish she were, rather than be living to bear this disgrace." "Father! tell me what has happened. Do not keep me in this terrible suspense." Oh, John! I would have parted with my last dollar, yea, I would have died to save you from such a sin." John stood like one in a dream. Tired, faint and frightened, he could not believe himself to be the same person that he was only an hour ago.  Some strange feeling came over him, that he must have become   XLI *   CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, suddenly insane while at the asylum. His father spoke again: - "John, where is the money? What have you done with it? - This was a tangible question. It brought the boy back to real life. "The money, father?-the money? Here it is-all that you gave me.  I have not spent one cent of it"-taking from  his )ocket-book the two  ten-dollar bills un- ,hanged. "Not that! not that!" his father replied. You must know what I mean-   the money n the package for the bank." "The money for the bank?"John repeated, ike one aroused from sleep; "now I know That you mean--now I know what you lean!" and there was an expression, of udden relief in his face and voice. "That is all right. I carried it to the bank as soon as I came.   Mr. Phillips was there, and took    JUAVO) 1o JVIXsAJLiJ tVi jl * . v. it from me. You will find it all right, father." To our readers, who have followed the boy from the time he left his home till this hour, it would seem that innocence must have been written. in his face, and heard in the clear tones of his voice. The man, accus- tomed to deal with the guilty, ought to have felt these signs of honesty. But this officer of the law said, "You must go with me, sir!" and then John knew, by the pitiless tone of his voice, that he was deemed guilty of some great crime. He begged for a few minutes to get himself ready and eat some breakfast.  Food was brought to him, but he was obliged -to eat it in, the presence of the officer. John said afterwards that this first keen sense of humiliation was almost intolerable, and gave him an impulse to knock the man down. But the certainty of I   176    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, proving his innocence in a few minutes gave him patience. When they arrived at the bank, they found Mr. Phillips, the teller and the two clerks awaiting them. The package was handed to John, and he was asked if it was the same which he brought there yesterday John examined it carefully. "'The wrap- per is the same, sir. I know  it by the pencil mark which I put in one corner. There it is--'October 6th, 18-.' Yes, sir; that is certainly the outside of the package which I gave you yesterday, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon." Then Mr. Phillips showed him the dis- crepancy between the amount as given on the outside and that contained within the package. "I see, Mr. Phillips, 'twhat you mean. I could not understand before of what I was accused. I  kept the package close beside    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    1" me in the cars, and came from" the depot here without delay.  I cannot explain it." "Where were you last night?" asked Mr. Phillips. John did not seem to heed the question, but' turning to his father, said, -- "I can account for every moment since I left you yesterday." When he mentioned his sleeping in the little room adjoining the baggage car, his father hoped that here might be found the solution of the mystery; but John main- tained stoutly that the valise could not have been removed from his head. "You needn't commit yourself," said the policeman, with a sort of rough kindness in his manner. "I do not know what you mean by that," said John. "I have no disposition to tell anything but the truth." It never occurred to the boy that his word    178     CAPTAIN JOHN. could be doubted, or that anything more was necessary than to make this plain statement of facts. Now he hoped he might go to his friend. Poor Fred would need him sadly. Alas, poor John! you are already in a web from which you cannot free'yourself. The terrible truth dawned slowly upon him, that he was to be held guilty of theft ' he, who was'so happy and free but one hour  since! The terrible nature of the accusation overwhelmed him. He was so dizzy, and his heart was so heavy within 'him, that he clung to chair for support. "Father," he said at last, with a face from which all color had fled, and in a voice which would have moved a heart not utterly devoid of pity-"father, do you believe me guilty?" Mr. Grant's face was pale as marble, and around his lips there was a livid line, as he replied, - "I cannot think you are, my child.  In    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   1-7.9 his own good time, God will make your innocence to appear." Mr. Grant's thoughts travelled back to the hour when, with his own hand, he counted out the money. - Suddenly it occurred to him that one thousand dollars of this money was in bills of the Grocers' Bank -a new bank. There were ten of them, of the denomination of one hundred. He had taken the numbers of these notes in a memorandum book which he had with him. "Have you these?" he asked Mr. Phillips. Only one half of them-- five hundred dollars - could be found. He took the num- bers. "They may aid us, sir, and I sincerely hope that this mystery may be solved. I cannot believe your son guilty." "Father, can I go to Fred now? He needs me." The policeman smiled-a smile, let us   180     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, hope, more of pity for John's ignorance than of indifference to his position. "My son," said Mr. Grant, "if" it were possible for me to compromise this matter by the sacrifice of my whole fortune, and thus leave you at liberty, with the suspicion of guilt attached to your name, would you prefer it to a trial, and a triumphant vindica- tion of your honesty, which must follow?" "I want no compromise," said John, "be- cause I am not guilty. I would rather die than go back to college with such a suspicion resting upon me." Again the policeman smiled.  He -knew that the boy was already in the power of the 'law--that net which spreads itself all over the land, catching sometimes the innocent with the guilty in its tangled meshes. He could tell him, also, that the best way was not to struggle, lest he become more hope- lessly involved in its intricate meshes. "Be ^  .             .   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   181 patient, and wait," is the best advice that could be given in such cases. We will anticipate a little, and give an incident which seemed to implicate John in the robbery. On Tuesday morning, three days after John's visit, Halford, senior, came into the bank, and deposited two thousand dollars. Mr. Phillips ran his eye over the bills, laid one aside, and compared it with a number in his memorandum book. "Allow me, sir, to ask where you obtained this bill." Mr. Halford examined it closely. "In- deed I cannot tell you, sir. I came to the city on Saturday, called hither by the sudden death of a son. I left some important busi- ness unfinished, and returned to attend to it to-day. Let me see--I gave my younger son a check, and told him to go to Hamlin & Co., brokers, and get it cashed. He did not use the money, but handed it to me.  I *,.               182    CAPTAIN JOIN; OR, think-yes, I am sure-that is one of the bills." "And your son's name, sir?" asked Mr. Phillips, in his usual slow manner of speak- ing. "Is Frederic Halford, member of A---- college." "And rooms with John Grant, of Old- bury?" continued Mr. Phillips. "The same," replied Mr. Halford?"And now, in my turn, allow me to ask why these questions?" Mr. Phillips explained  all the circum- stances concerning the theft. "I cannot believe him guilty," said Mr. Halford. "But let us go at once to Hamlill's office.  Perhaps he can throw some light upon. the matter." They found only a clerk within. He ex- amined the bill, turned to a record, and read:- "Received, Oct. 6, five hundred   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   183 dollars, Grocers' Bank, from  Oldbury-- Grant." That was all. Just then Mar. Hamlin himself entered. He was a sharp, black-eyed man, who heard what Mr. Phillips had to say, watchilig him closely meanwhile. He had no knowledge of the matter; was out of town on Saturday; the record must have been made by the clerk. They had a quantity of the bills of the Gro- cers' Bank; but how this one bill came into the office, he could not tell. The clerk was correct; and if he remembered giving the bill to Halford, his word might be relied upon. "I thinlk I did, sir," said the clerk, look- ing, however, at Mr. HaImlin, as if he feared that he might be doing wrong by making the statement. HaImlin was looking another way, apparently indifferent as to what answer the ,clerk gave. "I tlink I handed that bill to your son, sir; but how the money came into   ^-- --- * VVLwsa-L^ 3- VU the office, I know nothing, save by this record. I should not know young Halford if he came here." There was no more information to be ob- tained here; and Mr. Halford, satisfied as' far as his own son was concerned, said,- "I will send Fred down, Mr. Phillips, and you can question him more closely about the money.. I remember very well his disap- pointment at Grant's not returning to him, and that he received a note from his father excusing his absence, but giving no sufficient reason for it." Now, Mr. Hamlin knew just when and from whom     he received that bill. His con- cealment of the truth changed the     whole course of two lives, and defeated Justice in her pursuit of the guilty; but I cannot say that the truth from  his lips would have lessened, in any degree, the amount of suf- fering which this unhappy affair caused.  A   LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAI.        185 falsehood, like a pebble thrown into the sea, makes at first a tiny circle, which widens and widens, till its influence is felt miles beyond the little ripple which circled round it as it fell. It was seven o'clock.   The supper-table was set in the dining-room of the Robins' Nest. The lamps were lighted, and the old- fashioned silver tea service shone brightly in their light,  Mrs. Grant, in a gray silk, with blue ribbons in her cap, was filling the silver cake-basket with chocolate and cocoa-nut macaroons -John's favorite cake.     Mary and Emily were in the parlor, practising sacred music for the morrow's service. The house was in its Saturday evening order. That old Puritan custom was not obsolete in the Grant family.   Bridget had -done her part in the kitchen, as the clean, white floor, bright tins, and her own white apron attested.  186    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  The front door opened at last, and Mrs. Grant went into the hall. Her husband was alone. "Where is John?" she asked. Then she saw, by the light of the hall lamp, how pale and haggard her husband looked. She laid her hand on his shoulder, while she trembled with fear. "Has any accident happened to John?" "Calm yourself, Mary. John is alive and well, I trust. Come with me; I cannot tell you here." He led her into her own room, and broke to her, gently as he could, the sad story. "Is that all?" said the mother, her eyes brightening, and the color returning to her face. "'Is that all "-as if a burden had fallen from -her heart. "John is innocent, of course. He never told a falsehood in his life. You must not let it depress you so.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   187 You are pale and haggard, and need some tea." "Where is Ned?" asked Mr. Grant. "He took an early tea, and walked out to the farm. He will be at home by eight." "Ring the bell for a cup of tea, May," said her husband. "I have not eaten a mouthful since morning, nor have I slept a moment since yesterday morning." He sanlk down into a chair, worn out with the events of the day. Mrs. Grant brought the tea herself, fresh and strong. She was the comforter now.  So sure was she of John's innocence, that she was strong. She said to Mary, - "Mary, dear, I thought that John was dead when your father came home without him, and I was overwhelmed; but he is not dead, Mary-no, not dead; but a great trouble has come upon him-yes, a great trouble, which will be hard for the child to   188    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, bear. We must be brave and cheerful, and help him to bear it, sure that God will bring light out of darkness." Poor Mary could not; reply at first, after listening to the account of John's trouble. She recalled distinctly her fears when she saw him take the money, but it had given her no anxiety from that moment. "It will all come right, mother; I know it will. Let us thank God that we have such confidence in John. The most innocent may be accused of crime." Emily was called  up. There were no family joys or sorrows that Aunt Esther's household did not share with the Grants. She was of a different temperament from May -  more easily moved; and the sad news brought a flood of tears. She could only assert her belief in John's honesty, and hasten home  to pour her sorrow into the ear of her aunt. , ,     .   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   189 Mrs. Grant stood beside the massive iron door of the jail. It was evening. No moon or stars were to be seen, for clouds obscured their brightness. The "' whisper which the housekeeper at the parsonage had heard from the sea was heard also by the old elms, and, answered by the leaves, which trembled at the coming storm. The mother heeded it not; but the grating of the huge key in the lock, the crealking of the hinges, the heavy, close atmosphere, as the door opened,' struck a chill to her heart; but all the more eagerly did she seek her child. "In my heart I believe your boy innocent," said the kind-hearted Mr. Akerman. "He isn't the stuff of which rogues are made. I have known him ever since he was born." The kind words touched the mother's heart. She could only reply, - "Thank you, Mr. Akerman.   Now lead- me to him."     190     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, John was seated on a stool, his head bowed on the small round table which stood at the head of the narrow iron bedstead. Dark- hess, solitude, long wakefulness, and the sense of some cruel wrong had at last over- whelmed him.  He did not look like the same boy.  At the sound of his mother's voice, he sprang to his feet, and threw his arms round her. "Oh, mother-! I can bear it better now. I thought if I could only see you, just for one moment, then I could sleep." "Johnnie, my child, my precious boy! you never told a lie in your life. Tell me, your mother, were you tempted to take that money? Remember, my child, a mother's love cannot cease, even if you are guilty." "Mother," said John, in a tone of re- proach, "can you ask the question? I was not tempted at all. I thought nothing about the money, only to deliver it safely. I wish z   Mrs, Grant's visit to John. Page 190.     "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  191 that Ned had not asked me to take it. I hate money! I never want to see any more in my life. I wish I could live on a desert island, like Robinson Crusoe. I would kick gold further from me than he did." This ebullition of feeling was good for the boy.  It relieved the indignation which needed vent. His mother let him talk on, and, while he did sot opened her basket, and asked him if he would eat some supper with her. As they ate they grew more cheerful, and both agreed that the result of a trial would be such that no dishonor could attach to John. Before they parted for the night, they knelt together by the side of that narrow cot, and the mother, with her arm' around the child, commended him to God, and prayed that he would bring light out of darkness, and make this trial a discipline for good. She had brought her own Bible to   192    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, leave with him; then, with a kiss- and a good-night softly spoken, she passed out into the corridor, where Mr. Akerman sat reading by the light of a hanging lamp. "I thank you for your patience,' she said, gently, and they passed into the yard. "I will make John as comfortable as I can under the circumstances, to the extent which the law permits," said the jailor. Mrs. Grant went to her own room com- forted, believing that in the darkest hour there is some ray of light. "Despair is never quite- despair." Of all the circle of friends who were interested in John, none slept more peacefully than mother and son. Aunt Esther sat by the window in her own room. It commanded a view of the jail and the keeper's house. She could .see but dimly, in the darkness, the stone wall that surrounded them. She longed to penetrate it, and say one word to John. Finding that   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   193 impossible, she. undressed herself, praying -all the time that he might be sustained in this trial. Having " put on her night-cap and blown out her light," like Dame Crump in the story-book, she "went to bed." But Aunt Esther never could sleep if any one was in trouble and she had not tried to relieve it. Her only opiate was St. Paul's--the same, probably, which gave him rest in a Roman prison or on his missionary tours among false brethren--"to comfort the' people, support the weak, and be patient toward all men." Finding that she could not sleep for thinlk- ing of John, she rose, looked out of her window, and perceived a light in the keeper's sitting-room. Her cloak and hood were quickly donned, and she on her way to the place. Mr. Akermtan smiled as he opened the door   194    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, to her. "I know your ring, Miss Esther. I have been expecting you." "I couldn't sleep, Mr. Akerman. I tried to do so, indeed I did; for I thought I would not trouble you to-night. It was of no use, aud just for my own peace I have come. If I do not sleep nights, I cannot do much good days. How is the dear child?" "He is doing well. Johnnie is a brave fellow, but this is a pretty hard thing for him. There is some mystery about it which a trial only will remove. TVe must wait patiently, Miss Esther. His mother has been with him, and I think they are both better for her visit." "Do you think he will sleep?" "Be sure; why shouldn't he? I believe his conscience is clear, and we know his -health is good." "It is a terrible affair. Do you believe the real thief will be found?"   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   195 In her interest for the suffering, Aunt Esther sometimes asked a great many ques- tions which were difficult to answer. "Yes, I think so; but the least said about it for the present, the better. I have an idea that the mischief was done in the cars; plenty of rogues travelling nowadays." Aunt Esther was comforted, and went home to sleep.  She dreamed that night that she was a shepherdess upon the celestial hills, and that a wolf had stolen a lamb from her flock. Sunday morning came to Oldbury with a north-east storm- one of those storms pe- culiar to the sea-coast. The sharp, east wind from the Northern ocean penetrates to the bones of the rheumatic invalid, piercing even to the joints and marrow.  The sky was overcast with low-hanging, heavy clouds, that held, evidently, a large draught from the Northern seas, ready to pour upon the land.   196    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, The wind whistled through the swaying- branches of the elms, and tossed the dyingo leaves to their lowly graves; while the deep bass of the ocean mingled with the- sharp treble of the wind. The family at the Robins' Nest were late to breakfast.  Bridget had prepared it as usual; but her eyes were red, and she- said more than once aloud to herself, "Och! and it's not him at all. I would as soon think of stealing myself as that child. It is a sharper rogue has taken the money; not Johnnie, the darlint! The saints bless him!" She went to her morning service and re- turned; but the house was still, the bre-ak- fast untouched. A step at last broke the silence. It was Mrs. Grant, in her dressing- gown, going up to Ned's room.  He was dressed, .and sat reading. "Oh, Ned, my boy! I am glad you are up. You must do all you can to help and   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   197 comfort your poor father. I never saw him so cast down before. I think he believes in John's innocence; but he says the'very sus- picion of dishonor pains him. If you were not here for him to lean upon, I fear he would sink under it. He has slept little for two days. Come down and take a cup of coffee with me, Ned, and then take your grandfather to church. Break this sad news to him gently as possible." "Will he go in the storm'?" asked Ned. He never stays away, if in usual health. You can at least drive down there." "Do you think we ought to go to church to-day, mother?  "We never needed its consolations more," said his mother. e' The storm is too bad for Emily and myself. Your father is not able; but you will represent us, I hope." "I will go if you wish it," said Ned, and he accompanied her to the breakfast-room.   198    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Grandfather Fletcher and Willie were the only persons in the congregation that were igcnorant of the cause of John's absence from church. Ned did not explain it, but brought them to his -father's house at close of service. This was well; for when Mrs. Grant told him the sad story, he did not say, as she confidently expected he would, "Of course the boy is innocent; it will all come right; " but his whole frame trembled, and there passed over his face an expression of deep anguish :-"Has this sorrow come upon me? The cup is bitter. Mary, my child, I will lie down upon the lounge. Old age, like childhood, is weak to bear trouble." "But, father dear, it will soon pass away. We must -only be patient and wait. Our boy will be quite a hero when the real thief is brought to justice."' "Leave me alone, my child, was his an-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    I  swer. "I can bear it better when I have carried it to God in prayer." Willie heard the account in silence. Only by the clasped hands, pressed more and more tightly together as Mrs. Grant narrated the circumstances, the pale face, and the motion- less figure in the attitude of listening, would one have known that Willie understood it; but, from that hour, for many long, weary weeks, no smile came to Willie's face. He went about like one who had lost a priceless jewel and was searching for it--searching with those sightless eyes so earnestly that it was pitiful to see him. Those who knew him well said, "It seems as if God would give him back his sight'; for his daily life is only a prayer for the gift." Sight was given to him at last, not in the sense in which they spoke, but an inner sight, clear and searching, such as no de-   200    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, tective's experience or lawyer's skill could give. Aunt Esther said, one day, after talking with him, "I believe that God leadeth the blind by a way we know not. In him is no darkness at all; and if we live in him, he will lead us in a path brighter than the sun- lighted track of the eagle." But we are anticipating. One thing only looked strange in Willie. He did not visit John, nor seem  to desire it, but sent him daily some little token of remembrance. He was in his uncle's family more than formerly, and  transferred, apparently, some of his friendship for John to Ned.  He sat with him in his room, he rode with him, and went to the bank, where he would sit for hours motionless, save those restless, blind eyes of his, which looked as if the light they sought would come back to them. The Oldbury people came   at last to say, ,   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   201 "Who would have thought that Willie would have transferred his love so suddenly? John was the favorite among his cousins, and Willie forsakes him in his trouble!" To some, thisg was additional evidence for his guilt; and, they said, "Blind folks can see things which are invisible to us." Of course there were those who thought it no stran ge thing that a young fellow in John's situation should be tempted to take money.  "Why, the thing happens every day," they said, " in other places; and why should Oldbury be exempt?" "If the boy will only confess it," said others, "it will go easier with him." But almost everybody said, "He will never do that." "Such obstinacy looks .like guilt," said a bystander, whose logic was as defective as that of some of his ancestors in the days of witchcraft.   202    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, The north-east storms of Oldbury often continue three days. Eiercer and fiercer blew the east wind -that salt breath of an angry sea; the waves flung the long kelp high on the beach; the houses rocked in the storm; while the incoming sailors, with sails closely reefed, watch the gleam of the light- house, and are wary lest they be driven upon the rocks of that dangerous coast. Those rejoiced whose friends were on the open ocean or safe at their own firesides. Aunt Esther sat in her cosy sitting-room, her knitting in, halid, but looking out upon the storm. -I cannot settle myself to any business to-day," the old lady said. "TOnily, dear, what are you playing to-day? It is all in one key." The young girl sat at the piano, running her hand listlessly over the keys; but the notes were all in the minor key,+   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   203 "Auntie, it is of no use. I cannot practise to-day." "Do not try, child; give it up to-day. Run into the kitchen, and make some wine- jelly for Mrs. March. Her rheumatism will be terrible in this east wind. If you will make it, I will get it to her." Emily left the room. The old lady folded up her knittingi-work, and said to herself, "I cannot help it if it does storm. I must see Mr. Fletcher to-day." ;Mrs. March lived on the road to the par- sonage. She would venture as far as that in the storm; perhaps she could go further. She was not one who usually turned back from an expedition. With belted water- proof, and hood tied firmly down under her chin, she faced the storm, and stopped only long enough with Mrs. March to say a kind word and leave her jelly; but her coming 1 ,    204    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, merely was a precious bit of sunshine to the old lady. Grandfather Fletcher was in his library, reading by an open wood-fire. A table was beside him, on which lay a Greek Testament, a huge folio with a Latin title; and an open box, Containing letters and papers yellow with age, and various boxes and trinkets. The minister's face looked paler than usual, perhaps from the contrast with a black velvet cap which he wore, to protect his head from the draughts of wind which camne, without a welcome, into the old-fashioned windows. A few white locks strayed from beneath the cap, the blue eyes were dim, and the hands trembled. He Welcomed Aunt Esther with genuine cordiaity, called the housekeeper to take her wet cloak and overshoes, and brought, himself, to her a tiny glass of warming cordial.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    205 "How  kind of you to come to-day! Hark! do you hear that?" as, amid the pauses of the storm, strains of wild, sad music were heard. "Willie has been playing like that almost all day. It is music that makes my heart weep. I fear Willie suffers more keenly than the rest of us on John's account; he is so sensitive in his nature, and is shut out from many sources of comfort to which others have access." "We all suffer, Mr. Fletcher. I cannot settle to my daily duties for thinring of him. The poor boy has sent for his books this morning; he seems to have more philosophy than the rest of us. It does seem hard that an innocent boy should suffer thus.  We must leave nothing undone to prove the accusation false." The old gentleman listened to her respect- fully, and paused when she finished the last sentence, as if he wished her to say more; L g   Aj i AlLN JOHN; OR, but Aunt Esther, who was never at a loss for words, was arrested by somethingo in the look and manner of the old gentleman which did not respond to her confident belief in John's innocence. He looked into the burning coals a mo- ment, and crossed his pale hands, while a look of agony, like' the shadow of death, passed over his face. He rose, and looked down upon the gentle woman before him with a sad, pitying look, as if he could not endure to inflict the pang which he thought truth demanded. Only a decade of years lay between these two, and memories of the same   youthful friends and of scenes familiar to both came before them. He stood, for a moment, loor- ing at the face of Aunt Esther-a    face beautiful in its old age, from the unselfish love which gleamed from it. "Miss Esther," he said, "of all the friends   of my youth, you alone are left to me-; and you were but three years old when I entered collee - but seven when a shadow darkened our household that has not left it all these long, weary years. We have lived so long in Oldbury that we forget we are not natives of the place"-- "Never, never, Mr. Fletcher!  Do you think I forget dear old Concord, our house by the river, the lilies on the pond, the little red schoolhouse and " The old gentleman smiled. Thick and fast thronged the shadows of the past around him. But he continued: "Your father came here during the first year of my ministry. I was ordained in my twenty-third year. Do you remember my brother Fred, Miss Esther?" The old lady started.  She was taken by surprise at hearing a name which, in her girlhood, was spoken only in a whisper by   208:    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR,  the members of her family. There was a sad story connected with his name, but the particulars she never knew.  She recalled now the words of her father spoken when' she was a child - "We must learn to forget Cousin Fred." "I see you recall the name," said Mr. Fletcher. "You need not explain your hesi- tation. I am aware that you are ignorant of the cause of his lifelong exile from home. He was my elder brother-a tall, handsome youth, the pride of his mother, and the one on whom my father leaned to sustain his name anid honor when he should pass away. Here is his picture." He took from a box on the table a m'inia- ture, on ivory, of a youth in the first flush of opening manhood. The dark, wavy hair, the regular features, the proud poise of the head, and the rich glow  of 'the cheek, all exquisitely delineated by the artist, made it i  .  A  }       "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   2U0 no marvel that he should be a mother's pride. Aunt Esther looked at it for some time in silence. "It is the very image of our Ned." "Yes, it resembles him; but Ned is not as handsome. He lacks the fine color of Fred; and then Ned has the Grant eyes--not as full and large as these. :Fred was a Saul for beauty among his fellow-students, and he had also rare gifts of intellect. In an evil hour he fell. Idolized at home, a favorite in college, he became extravagant in his- habits, and, led on from one wrong step to another, he came, at last, in an hour of great temptation, to forge his father's name to a note for some thousands.  My father was a man of small means, but he gave up every- thing. to shield his boy from the penalty of the law. There were. those, however, who determined that Fred should suffer for his crime. Vindictiveness --envy, as some said,   210     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, but perhaps only a sense of justice, led them to hunt for the guilty, till he was no longer safe in his father's house. He disguised him- self and fled. I aided him. I misled those who pursued him; and, Miss Esther, the only lie I ever told in my life, I told for Fred. All these years it has been upon my conscience --this, and our pride, that would not suffer the law to punish the transgressor. The Fletchers are a proud race.  They needed affliction, and God sent it to them; but it has not always brought them nearer to him." "Surely, you forget your daughter Mary, who is meek and lowly-minded as a saint." The old gentleman shook his his head. "Proud of her children - proud of her chil- dren, Miss Esther, forgetting that by God's grace alone they can stand; often saying, and always thinking, 'My children will not go astray;' blinded to the deceitfulness of the   "OSS IS SOMETIMES. GAIN.   2" human heart, trusting to their sense of honor and self-respect, rather than' bidding them pray: with David -' Teach me, O Lord, and lead. me' in the way I should go;' and with Pau--' That I may be found in Christ, not Having my-own righteousness, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteous- ness which is of -God by faith.' I have feared this misfortune for many years, Miss. Esther. I may say that I have looked for it. I have watched Mary's children with the greatest anxiety; and when Ned came to look so much like Fred, I trembled for his future. My observation has taught me that moral defects sometimes descend like hered- itary diseases; and, while the latter may be guarded against, and perhaps subdued by the skill of the physician, the formfer also may be checked by moral discipline and Christian training. But we must be forewarned; and my pride kept me from   ever cautioning   212    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Mary, or even from giving her the sad history of my brother Fred. Generations repeat themselves, Miss Esther., The asthma never fails to reappear in the second genera- tion; consumption is a taint of blood; and the very features of your great-great-grand- father come to us in John." "Yes, Mr. Fletcher, and he is Scotch, through and through-the Scotch features and the sturdy pluck of the old Covenanters. I don't know anything about laws of moral and physical descent that you talk about. I believe my catechism-at least, I suppose I do! but I have no time for studying creeds. I read a chapter in the New Testa- ment every day, and then I try to do just as Christ did--feed the poor, heal the sick, and tell the ignorant the story of Christ's love and sufferings. You have lived too much amid these musty old theological books."    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   213 "Not musty, not musty, Miss Esther- used too much for that.' "No, no, Mr. Fletcher; but dried-up old skeletons. I came here for comfort, and you give me an oldU bone from one of these skeletons. You have dwelt upon this'law of hereditary descent,' as you call it, till you have become morbid.   John Grant is an honest boy. There is some plot against him, or he is involved by a train of unfortunate circumstances. We must unravel the mys- tery if possible. We must spare neither money, time, nor skill. John will have a trial; there is no avoiding it now. John says he will have no compromise, if that were possible. I like him for that.  He must be defended by the ablest counsel we can obtain. I came here to-day to ask you to write to your friend Tracy, who is said to be the best advocate in the State."   214      CAPTAIN JOHN. "I will do that, Miss Esther, of course. A fair trial is every man's right." While they talked, the music ceased, and Willie came into the room. A smile lighted his features for a moment when he recognized Aunt Esther's voice; but it passed quickly- away, and the features settled into that grave, introspective look which they had worn since John's trouble.   CHAPTER VI. Deportment of John on his Trial.-Stella Drummond's Letter to Tom. --Tom's Return from Sea. IT was some months after the close of our last chapter, when Stella Drummond, dressed as usual in rich, bright colors, and looking like a tropical bird in gold  and  scarlet plumage, seated herself in a corner of her own room that'looked out upon the sea, to write a letter. She tied back her curls with a scarlet ribbon, opened her little rosewood writing-desk, and spread a sheet of French paper upon it, then took up her gold pen with its amber handle to write. Stella de- lighted in rich colors and pretty things, and (215)   216    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, her father's love gratified this taste. She wrote, in a neat but school-girl hand,- - "DEAR Toi:'"--then her eyes became dim, so that she could not see the lines. She brushed away the mist, looked out upon the ocean, so calm and blue that day, and said--"Oh, Tom! I cannot write. I wish you were here, and then I could tell you all about it." Then the curly head went down upon the plump little arm that rested upon the table, the pen dropped from her hand, and tears came in a shower, utterly spoiling the French paper. In a few minutes she rallied, threw aside the blistered sheet, and began again. "DEAR TOM :-- I wish you were here. I wish you had never, gone to sea, and then this trouble never would have come upon us; no, I do not believe John would ever-be shut up in that horrid prison if you had been at home.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   '217 "But I must go back and tell you all about it; for papa says that you may not have received the letters which were for- warded to Calcutta. "Well, to go back a long ways: John carried some money to Boston, from his father's bank, last October. It was not Mr. Grant's money, but belonged to the Home Manufacturingo Company, for whom   Mr. Grant had bought some stock in Boston. Ned asked John, to take it.  It was real hateful in him to ask John, when he could just as well have sent it by the next day's express. His excuse is, that it was necessary to send it that day, and the express had gone.  "I never liked Ned, though he is a great favorite in town. I know that he was the best scholar in school, and that he is said never to make mistakes in reckoning money. The crusty old fogies in town, who spend  **    218    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, half their time with both hands on their money-bags, shake their rusty heads, and say -' Remarkable young mal! very accu- rate! -,Bids fair to be very rich.' As if to be rich was the greatest attainment in life! "Then, all the girls say he is handsome. 'Well, then, I don't like good scholars -they are-prigs; and I do not like handsome folks -they are conceited (especially handsome men); and I do' not like men who think more of money than of wives and children, brothers and sisters, and-friends. So, you see, I am no friend to Ned Grant, and I hate him for being the means of getting John into such trouble. He knew, as you and I do, that John is rather careless, though he has improved very much in that respect; but when we were at school together, Ned was very nice and prim. always looking as if he came out of a band-box, while Johnnie   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  219 used to tear his clothes and lose his books, and give away his money. "But I must not go back to the old school-. days, though I wish they had lasted till this time, but tell you the rest of my sad story. "John went to jail!-our jail here in Oldbury. Only think! I know how it will sound to you; but hardly any one here thought the worse of him, because they believed him innocent. "But I must go back again. I forgot to say that, when he handed the money to the Boston bank, there were two thousand dol- lars missing; and, because they can find, no one else guilty, they think they have proved that John took it--our John, who never took a dollar that was not his own!--no, never-I know he didn't, not if the learned 'judge' and able 'advocate,' as the papers say, pronounce him guilty, a There was a long trial, which produced a   220    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, great deal of excitement in town. Judge Story was on the bench, and Mr. Tracy was ,John's lawyer, and papa says that everything was done for John that able -counsel and friends could do ; but, somehow, Tom, if you had been here, I think you would have got John out of trouble. .The few who thought him guilty brought everything they could think of against him.' "He said, one day, that he could pick the new lock of the bank safe; and they pretend that the lock was tampered with the night of the fire-the night when John was in the- bank alone for some hours.  Old 'Squcire Brown, who owns most of the stock in the Home Manufacturing Company, thinks John is guilty, and thinks he brought evidence enough to prove it. , John was alone in the conductor's car when he went to Boston, and the old 'Squire says he had a good chance there to talke the money--just as if we all   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   221 hadn't chances enough to be wicked, if we had the wickedness to improve them I "But the strongest evidence against John was, that certain bank-notes, bearing the numbers that, Mr. Grant recorded himself, were found, or rather traced, to Halford's possession. Halford, you know, was John's room-mate in college, and they were together in Boston on the day that the money was missed. "Halford's family were all in Europe, so that they were not here. at the trial. Grand- father Fletcher was there, with his noble, white head bowed upon his cane, and I noticed that his hands trembled very much. Willie sat by his side, his ear inclined towards the judge, who was summing up the evidence, and his hands tightly clasped. His eyes--blind eyes we know  they are; but they have a strange look in them ever since; John lost that money. There seems   222    CAPTAIN JOHN; On, to be, in all his features, such an earnest longing for sight, that I have called his beautiful, pale face a sculptured prayer. Do not laugh at the expression. I can describe it in no other way. Mr. Grant was there also, stern and silent as an old Roman, who was determined to bear his trouble bravely; but, all the time, I know that his heart is breaking. "I watched Ned closely, because I thought he never would forgive himself for sending the money by John. I must acknowledge that he was very pale and thin. His great, handsome eyes looked larger than ever, and there were dark circles about them, as if 'he had not slept for a long time. When he was called upon to make some statement, his lips trembled, and he was hardly able to speak. Everybody pitied him, and some- body near me whispered-'How keenly he feels the disgrace!'-as if he could, be   "OSS IS SOMETIMES. GAIN.   223 thinking of anything else, at that time, but the terrible suspense of poor John! "I came out when the jury retired; for father would not let me remain.  Emily Mills spent the day with Mary. It is won- derful to see how calmly our dear, retiring i Mrs. Grant bears this trouble. She goes to see John every day; and Mr. Akerman says that, after the first week, John has been as cheerful as his mother. He has his books with him, and keeps up his studies as well as he can by himself. He looked well, only pale from confinement--better than Ned; but then, John has been sure that he should be acquitted, and has slept and eaten well, while Ned has known that there were those who would give strong evidence against his brother. "Mother and I could eat no dinner that day. We sat together, listening to every footstep, till father came; and then we   224    CAPTAIT JOHN; OR, knew, by one glance at his face, that it had gone against poor John. "For how long?' said my mother. "I knew what she meant, but those were her only words. "'Five years,' said my father 'but we hope it will be lessened, on account of his youth and previous character.' "I could not say one word, Tom; but I thought- how much you loved John, -and how sadly you would feel to think of John's bright, cheerful face behind prison bars. "I went to my own room, and wept till mother came to me and said I should make myself sick if I did not stop. "'I am sick now,' I said; 'for my head is burning hot, and my heart is beating hard. What a wicked world this is, mother! Great men that call themselves learned haven't the wisdom of children. Cannot they see that John is innocent? Would a boy of his age   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.,  225 eat and sleep and study, and be so cheerful, if he were guilty?' "' Not unless he is very hardened, which I do not believe John to be,' said my mother; and, as she spoke, I felt her tears upon my face. This colmforted me; and when, in a few minutes, she brought me something warm to take, I drank it, and fell asleep. "I have written you so long a letter that my hand is very tired, and now I see that 'the paper is blotted with my tears, which -have made great blisters in it. You must excuse me, Tom; for, if I should write you ever so many letters, I could not write about John without spoiling the paper every time. "I hope you will come home soon; but when you do, you will feel as John did about you, when he came home for vacation- 'Why, Stella! it does not seem at all like Oldbury without John.' i '15   226    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Papa and mamma send love. "Yours truly, S STELLA DRUMmOND." There were many little circumstances which bore very hard upon John at the trial- trifles in themselves, but which made the cumulative evidence seem strong. But the testimony of the broker, Hamlin, was direct and positive. He swore that John brought those bills which corresponded in numbers to those in Mr. Grant's memorandum to his office on Friday. John never saw the man till he met him in court, though Hamlin swore to his iden- tity. His partner testified also that the bills came from the Phoenix Bank, Oldbury, on that day. The presents which John had given .his friends were brought as additional testimony against- him, showing that he was lavish in the use of money. The judge, who made the following statement in his sumn ming   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   227 up, was considered a wise and humane man: -"All the circumstances of knowledge and act point to the accused; but the jury will take into account the previous character of the boy, and the absence of any sufficient motive; but, at the same time, the power of temptation is strong, and our youth are fast becoming corrupted by this increasing thirst for gold." It is not strange that after the evidence adduced and the Judge's charges the jury brought in a verdict of guilty, but with a re- commendation that the sentence be as lenient as was in the power of the Judge to give. It would seem, almost, as if our little Stella was correct, that, finding no one else on whom to charge the theft, they had made a victim of John. . Mrs. Grant had so confidently expected her son's acquittal that every prepar-ation had been made to welcome hinm. The table was   228    CAPTAIN JOHN; ORE spread, a fire made in his room, and the household waiting in eager expectation for his return, merry and bright, as in former times. Her husband had tried to prepare her for a different result, but she was so convinced of the innocence of her child, that she was sure judge and jury would see it as she did. The Judge was a good and kind-hearted man. Not one, save the more immediate friends of the accused, felt more keenly for the afflicted family. The jury were honorable men, -who would gladly have given a different verdict, but, as one of them afterwards said, the testimony of Mr. Grant went as far as that of any one else to condemn his son. But, not to save his child from death would this descendant of the Covenantees, have concealed one iota of the truth. He was sure that the money was sent in the package from his bank.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   229 John was convicted, because, as one of the jurymen  said, - "no one else could have taken the money, and yet it went against my heart to bring him in guilty, - the boy whose face bore no trace of crime, and whose life had been free from reproach." "Will you go home to Mary?" said Mr. Grant to Grandfather Fletcher, when the verdict was brought in. The old gentleman bowed his head, and with Willie at his side, moved toward the door, where the carriage was waiting for him. Ned drove, but not a word was spoken dur- ing the ride to the Robins' Nest. Mrs. Grant went out herself to open the carriage door, and saw, first of all, the pale face and sight- less eyes of Willie from which the tears were dropping--the first she had ever seen him shed. Then she knew all.'  There was no need for her father to speak, but he laid his hand upon her shoulder and said, "When \  I   ^230    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, thou passest through the waters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." She turned-away without speaking and went to her own room.    The sun shone brightly into the windows, but the room was dark to her. There was a good fire in the grate, but she was shivering with cold. For a few minutes her trouble rolled in great waves over her soul, and she sank down upon the floor in an agony of despair, with a terrible crushing doubt in Gods' love, and rebellion against the injustice of man. Had not he who knoweth the secrets of all hearts permitted the wicked to triumph? This state of mind was terrible to this woman who had never doubted Gods' love before. Ayl trust him now, poor bruised spirit.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    231 Trust him in the darkness and the storm, for Though clouds may surround us, our God is our light, Though storms rage around us, our God is our might. Trust Him still, for "He'll never, - no, never, - no, never, forsake." She rose at last, looking aged and worn. "How foolish for me," she said, "to be yielding to my sorrow here when John is suffering alone!" She dressed herself mechanically and bade Ned drive her to John. "Quick! Ned, no delay.." She fancied that he lingered. "Ned! Ned!" she exclaimed, "don't you hear me? It seems to me that you do not understand what I want. You are hard and stern and silent. Do you think I do not love my John as well, yes, better, than ever?" "I never complained," said Ned, "because you loved him better than myself."   232    CAPTAIN JOHN; On, Mrs. Grant looked at Ned, saw how thin and pale he had become, noted the hollow eyes, and the dark circles around them. O Ned! my child, forgive me, grief has made me unjust. I see how you have suffered. It is your nature to be reserved and silent. Forgive and bear with me." Ned made no reply, but his manner was very tender and kind as he helped her into the carriage and folded the wraps around her. "John! John! speak one word. Just one word to your mother! This silence from you is the hardest to bear in this hour of trouble. Just look at me, at your mother's face, one instant, John." The boy was seated on his cot-bed, his arms thrown upon the little table, and his head bowed upon them, motionless as if his young life had suddenly gone out in darkness. He neither moved nor spoke.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   233 His mother sat beside him, her. hand upon his shoulder; but her pleading words fell on deaf ears. At last she said,- "John, John, God's love never fails. In the darkest hour he is near. Let us pray to him." With a sudden motion, almost fierce in its manner, John threw his mother's hand from his shoulder, and turned towards her. "I have no faith in God, or heaven, or prayer!" As he spoke, his face wore the stony, stern look of despair, fearful to see in one so young.  In the infinite thermometer of human pain, there are, perhaps, few degrees of suffering lower than this hopelessness in youth. Conscious of his innocence, he was branded as a thief, and was now to be immured for years in a gloomy prison. No wonder the prospect appalled him.   234    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, John was not a Christian. He had been a loving, affectionate child; but, of the faith which sustained St. Paul in prison, distress, famine, sword and nakedness, which ejaabled him to say, "I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me," John was ignorant. He thought he loved God, when he was sailing on a smooth and sun ny sea; but now that the storm had come, he was without an anchor. That look of despair cut his mother to the heart. She felt helpless under this load of misery.  "John, my dear child, I wish that I could suffer for you. If they would imprison me, and let you go free, it would make me so happy, so happy, John, that no words can express it." John's lip quivered. "It is a great mystery to me," his mother continued. "I cannot understand it; why   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   235 this great trial should come upon us; but I am praying for strength to say, 'Thy will be done.'" "Mother, I could bear it better if I were shre that my father believed in my inno- cence; but he said to me only to-day, ' John, if you are guilty, confession is the only sure way to peace.' That was cruel, mother; I cannot bear it. And my grandfather, who, I thought, would speak kind and comforting words, evidently doubts me." "Well, John, I, your mother, who know you better than all the rest, who, if you were guilty, would still gather you to my arms in love, I believe you as innocent as myself in this matter; and I know that God will bring it all to light in his own good time. It is said of our Saviour, 'Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.' This trial is terrible for us, but our heavenly Father has   236    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, , some good purpose for you; it is a part of your life-discipline, and some day you may thank him for this very affliction. Let us thankl him now that you are not guilty --that you were not left to commit this sin. Have you thought of that, John? Which would you choose? - to be the guilty one, free, or the guiltless, suffering for another's crime?" John's face softened. "Mother, you know me well enough to know which I would choose. I would not do so mean an act-no, not if I knew I could walk out of this door a free man by doing it." The mother's only answer was a kiss. With that kiss, the words which bad inter- ested him so much only a few days before this misfortune overtook him seemed to whis- per themselves in his ear--' Amid all the osin and shame, the hard routine, the bitter- hness, the falsehood of this world, there was   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   237 one Man, always tender, always strong, giv- ing his life for the race, full of faith, full of hope in man; " and his mother now said that he was made perfect through suffering. The mother watched the play of the child's face, saw the muscles relax and the expres- sion soften. "Oh, mother! \how could I live without you?" "And you will pray, John, that I may live till you are proved innocent of this charge before the world?" :Wnill He hear me, when I doubt him as I have to-day?" "His mercy never faileth, John.  And, my boy,- if you will help me to live, bear this trial bravely. Terrible as it is, bear it. Do not sink under it. God will bring your righteousness to light." In this hour of need, the gentle, retiring woman, who was seldom seen outside her    238    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, home, who had been tenderly watched and cared for by her husband, was now the strength and comfort of the household. Mr. Grant nerved himself to bear it all in silence. Poor Mary was utterly overcome, and thrown into a slow fever. Ned was the shadow of his former self; but he went reg- ularly to the bank, was devoted to business, and always at his post. His father trusted him more and more; and the directors of the bank, who had been such for thirty years, thought him a prodigy. The day that John left Oldbury for his prison life was beautiful. There had been a heavy, white frost the previous night, and the trees on the low, wooded hills in the west were sparkling with gems. The old elms on High street flung their jewelled boughs over the homes which their foliage had shaded from the summer heat.  The river sparkled in the light, its shallow edges   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   239 only frozen, making the stream look like a blue ribbon with silver edges. One vessel in full sail was going out into the broad, free sea; and John, who longed for that freedom, must turn from all this to a convict's cell 5 He held in his hand two bits of paper which Aunt Esther had given him--one, this passage, copied by herself:-"The be- -loved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him, and the Lord shall cover him all the day long," The other paper was the follow- ing note:- "DEAR JOHN : Aunt Esther has cried herself sick. Bad as we all feel I do not think even you could help smiling to see her. She came down to breakfast in her black satin gown, yesterday, the one she wears only on great occasions, mistaking it for the old black wrapper, and she had no cap on her dear old   240    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, head; then. she ^put salt into her coffee in- stead of sugar, and forgot to say to me, 'Emma, dear, your practice hour. Improve all your time and talents.' She hasn't been out of the house for a week, excepting to see you. I tell her that Auntie Brown and poor Jim Lane, and black Sally, and paralytic Betsey, are all suffering for want of her visits. She only sighed and said, '0 Emma' dear, my faith is sorely tried;I am in the "slough of despond," and I cannot get out because of the heavy burden that is on my back.' "'Well, auntie, said I, 'I am not going to fall into any slough of despond on John's account. Just think of all the good men that have been -shut up in prison-there was Socrates and Paul, and Columbus, and Ra- leigh, and Bunyan, and Kossuth, and Hamp- den.' "'Stop child!'. she cried out, 'putting St.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN,  241 Paul with Kossuth, and Bunyan with Col- umbus! You are as bad as some of the modern religious newspapers, so called. I did not talk so when I was a girl. Then what a jumble you made! Who would have thought that you had studied English history with Mr. Fletcher? Our Johnnie has found a nobler example than any of those you have named. He said to me in a whisper when I bade him good-bye, 'Auntie there was one -who pronounced a blessing upon those who were persecuted falsely, do you think I may claim it?' Dear fellow! God is leading him by this sorrow into great joy. But I cannot bear, to think of one so young shut up in that dreary place. If they would only take me! My worn old body is'nt worth much, and perhaps I could do some good among the wicked and the sick there.' "'Do not think that for a moment, Auntie; you would not have a chance. Pious   242     CAPTAIN JOHN. people, and ministers, and professors would come to do you good, and pity that poor hardened old woman who would not confess her guilt.' "The idea was so comical that I could not help laughing. But I do really think my dear blessed auntie would be willing to go to prison if she could thereby make one sinner turn from the error of his ways, or carry comfort to one poor, despairing soul. "I need not ask you, John, to keep up a good heart, for I know you will, but you must study just as all great and good men do, who have been imprisoned. Your friends will not cease to think of you and will not rest till'.they find out the truth of this matter. "It will come out John! It will! Do not doubt it for a moment. Your affectionate Cousin, EMMA."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  243 No message reached John from Willie that day. He was too ill to leave the house, but lay on the lounge by the library fire, as, the housekeeper said, like one in a trance. He had visited John, but never expressed pity, or used words of consolation, but spent the time in asking questions while they ate their nuts and apples which he brought. They were minute and apparently unimport- ant questions, like the following: "Johnnie, I cannot understand why, if that package was made up and placed in the safe the night be- fore you went to Boston, Ned need have been so late as to miss the express." "Why, don't you know, Willie," said John, that there was a great deal of confusion that morning?  Ned was late, and Father was occupied with other business." "Yes, H understand," said Willie, "but why did'nt you give it to the expressman on the cars?" v  .       244    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Good reason why, Willie;he was not there himself. We have but one Boston ex- press per day, and that leaves at ten o'clock. I went on the noon train." "And," added Willie, "the bank does not open till ten o'clock." "No, not to the public, but Father and Ned are there sometimes an hour before the time. Ned is- a busy fellow, you know." "Johninie,'" added Willie, " you know what a sleepy fellow you are, or used to be in the old times, when we played together upon the farm., You once went fast asleep in old Dick's stall, while on his back, and Grand- father said that the good-natured creature never offered to taste the hay in the rack but stood, as if cut in stone, till you waked. Another time you fell asleep in a crotch of the old apple tree, and slept till noon. I felt my way softly to you and slipped Emily's gold ring from your little finger, but you   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   Za never stirred, but slept on till noon, and then after searching a long time for the ring, you "found it under your dinner plate." "Yes, yes, Willie I remember, but what has all this to do with my present trouble?" "Much every way,; as Saint Paul says, Johlnnie. Did'nt you sleep a whole hour on the cars?" "Yes, yes, but I tell you, as I have told hundreds, that I had the key to my carpet- bag in my pocket; besides the bag was tied with a string, a bit of twine which I found in my pocket, and there it was when I waked, tight and strong, as when I tied it with my own fingers. Besides, did not the conductor testify that no one else could have entered the car." "I will tell you, John, who must know more about this matter than any other per- son. That man Hamlin swore to a falsehood. Any one that will do that will steal."   246     CAPTAIN JOHN OR, If John had any theory about the robbery, he did not give it. Willie's face expressed more than before that earnest, longing to see, - to see! "O if I could see!" his face seemed to say. Oldbury settled itself into its former quiet ways after the excitement of the trial was over. Mr. Grant's tall form became bent, and his hair grew rapidly gray. He devoted all his leisure hours to Mary, whose recovery was very slow, and whose sole amusement was her studies, in which her father became as much interested as herself, aiding her in collecting and preserving flowers, riding far and near for a new specimen of moss or lichen. They were satisfied in each other's society, and were seldom seen away from the Robins' Nest. Mrs. Grant was the most cheerful member of the household.  She would live and keep well for John's sake. Who would comfort him like herself?   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    247 When Bridget was asked, one day, "How *is Mrs. Grant?" she replied, "Indade, ma'am, she is well, and smiles like a moonbeam. She grows so like the picture of the Holy. Virgin in the church, that I'm after mistaking the one for the ither." Grandfather and Willie never failed to be in their places at church, the elder guiding the footsteps of the younger. The old gen- tleman's face wore a look of resignation, beautiful to witness, almost sublime in its expression. "Thy will be done," was plainly written upon those calm, -pale features. The return of Toml from   his Calcutta voyage made a little ripple in this circle of friends. The ship had been telegraphed, and Stella saw it through the glass' in the observa- tory before any other eye had   caught a glimpse of its sails. She watched the pilot go out to meet her, and then her eye fol- lowed the vessel as it passed the rocks,   248     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, rounded the island, left the lower buoy behind her, crossed the bar, - no bar being visible, of course, in that state of the tide, - and up the river to the wharf. She saw the captain step upon shore and receive the con- gratulations of friends. Tom was a sailor; he must be. at work; no time yet to see friends. Her father went down to the wharf, and would soon come back "to tell her if all were well on board. 'Some of these days," she said to herself, "Tom would be captain himself, and he would be the first to step on shore and re- ceive a welcome." The girl's eyes grew bright and the color deepened in her cheek as she thought of it. She was a pretty pic- ture as she stood there, one hand on the glass, and the other holding back the curls, that she might see more distinctly the busy group upon the wharf. She was dressed in white,--for it was a summer day,-with   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   249 bright ribbons in her hair, and a broad sash of scarlet and white ribbon around her waist, that floated as gladly in the breeze as the red, blue and white on the mast-head of the vessel. Tom would come to tea; she was sure of that. He must see his -mother first, and then he would come to the Ridge. Would he be much. altered? Two years had passed since he left. Thilldking of the time reminded her of John.  One year of his sad life had passed. How different from Tom's busy life upon the sea!    \ Stella was not mistaken. Tom came to tea. He had altered. How short and broad he looked! And his face was burned brown, but his eyes were as sparkling as ever, and his voice had that hearty, cheerful ring, like the peal of sweet bells. "You are glad to get back home, I know, Tom."    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Am I not, birdie? But, Stella, I thought, when I received your letter giving me an account of John's trial, that I would never want to see Oldbury again. I have almost hated the place since then." - Oh, Tom! do not talk so. -You must ask my father about it, and he will explain to you that they tried to do right." "Tried to do right !" said Tom, contempt- uously.  "Wise judges and lawyers you must have had, that could not see that John Grant was incapable of such a deed!   I mean to look into the law myself before I go to sea again; but we will not talk about it now, or I shall use language that is not fit for you to hear." Tom was as good as his word. He learned all the evidence on which John was con- victed, and saw every person who testified on the trial. In conversation with Grand- father Fletcher, he said, -   I I   LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   251   "I will move heaven and earth to get at the bottom of this matter." "Say earth, Tom, not heaven." "No-earth and heaven, Mr. Fletcher; for I will get Aunt Esther to pray, night and dAy, for a blessing on my labors; and does not the hymn say,- 'And Satan trembles when he sees The weakest saint upon his knees'? If he trembles when the weakest saint prays, I guess he will shake till he gives up the secret he has been holding so long when Aunt Esther prays and I work." "I have had my fears, as time has passed," said the old gentleman, "that John might have been tempted to sin, as nothing has come to light to prove the contrary." Tom's face flushed, and an angry gleam shot from his eyes. He rose at once to go. Willie laid his hand on his grandfather's    252    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, shoulder' "Please not say that, grand- father." Tom rushed out of the house. He was- obliged to go, he said. I am sorry to say that Tom was not as careful, at that time, in the use of expletives, as he came to be some years afterwards. We find him, next, at the bank, talking with Ned. "Now, Ned Grant, where was all your shrewdness and business talent when your brother John was accused of a crime which he never committed? I'd never boast of my smartness after standing by and seeing him treated in that way. He's innocent, and you know it; and I'll prove it." "I wish youwouldn't swear so, Tom," said Ned, with lips white and trembling. "Swear! It is enough to make Abraham and Isaac and Jacob swear." "John didn't swear about it."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  253 "Not he.! Therefore I have double swear- inog to do. If you don't help me unravel this whole business, I shall think you had something to do about it yourself. You know a great deal better what to do with a thousand dollars than John, who never cared for money." - "Only to spend it," said Ned. "Take care, Ned i Don't you go to insin- uating that John may be guilty, or I will send you to a worse place than the state prison." And Tom  pounded the bank counter with his fist till every inkstand and ledger and paper-weight shook in their places. "'I wish you wouldn't be angry with me, Tom. Do you think I wouldn't be glad to see my brother free?" Tom paused a moment, looked at Ned, and saw for the first time how pale and thin and worn he looked.   254    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "You must excuse me, Ned. I have no control over myself when I thinlk O6 the injustice done to John. Of course you feel it. I believe you; but John did not steal that money, and somebody else did; and wouldn't Hlike to have the handling of the rascal?" "I should hope the law would not give him into your hands, Tom Wood." "Would you have, him nursed and dandled like a baby, Ned Grant? Is that the way you would treat the scoundrel who has taken two years out of your brother's life, and branded him with the name of thief? What would be your tender mercies toward the fellow?"  -Ned made no reply; and Tom turned away with another oath, saying also, - "You never would strike 'fire, Ned"- "though flint does sometimes," he muttered to himself.    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   255 Tom sought far and near for the witness Hamlin; but he was not to be found. Willie and Tom were together as often as Tom's time permitted. Both were like angels-- one like the loving spirit who came to open the Roman prison to the suffering disciples; the other like an avenging messenger with a drawn sword to smite the, guilty. They could only console themselves with the fact that John's time was commuted to two years.   CHAPTER VII. Scene in Prison. - Warden Hart. - A Mother's Love. ' WROWHERE, perhaps, in the a wide world, out of Holland, can there be found more neatness than in a Yankee kitchen where maiden ladies preside. One cool autumn morning, Aunt Esther and her sister Sabre were busy with their domestic duties; aind we will take a peep at them. The kitchen door opens to the south upon a little porch, over which a grape-vine has been trained as a screen from the midsummer heat. It is open now; and the sunlight and air tide in, bearing on their waves the fragrance of ripened fruits, the 256   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    257 shimmer of leaves, and the light and shade of travelling clouds.  That altar to good cheer, a modern cook- ing range, where the vestal fires never go out, is polished clean, and is bright as the tins that stand in shining rows. The marble sink is of a dainty whiteness, like that of the deal table, on which stand bowls of fruit-- pears, peaches and damsons. Aunt Esther, in a large, full, white- linen apron and plain morning-cap, is making jelly. .Sabre, dressed after the same fashion, sits in a low chair near the door' paring peaches for preserving. These sisters live happily together; the more so, because they are of opposite tempera- ments -such combine; not contrary-such repel. Sabre never leaves home, excepting to church or prayer-meeting,  or perchance, once or twice a year, to Grandfather Fletch- er's or the Robins' Nest. Esther never feels \   258    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "quite right in her mind," to go to bed unless she has made two or three visits to the sick and the poor. Sabre is happy in the kitchen, and is complete mistress in that domain, Esther deferring to her opinion in., all matters of culinary slkill. "As soon as I have finished this jelly, I will make some panada gruel for Auntie Cook. She is very feeble, and may not live many- days." "Be sure and skim it well, Esther, and boil it a long time," said Sabre. "Such slops as are given to sick people under the name of gruel are enough to send them out of the world before their time. There is our Emily-I can never trust her with it; for she has not patience to wait till it is done." "You must insist upon her doing it right," said Esther; "and that is just your way.- Nobody in town, or out either, makes it quite equal to yourself."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   259 "The child is generally willing enough to be taught; but lately she hasn't seemed quite herself. Have you noticed any change?" As Sabre spoke, she cast a side-glance at her sister, and could not fail to see a look of -concern shadowing her face. "Yes, Sabre," she replied, and I am glad you have spoken of it. She is devoted to her music, but not in just the way that pleases me. When she commenced practis- ing German music with Ned, she did so to divert him from the gloom and depression into which John's misfortune had thrown him. Now,-he comes every day after bank hours, and-and - it seems to me as if the child had almost forgotten Johnl in her friendship for Ned." "It is too true," replied Sabre. "I am at home more than yourself, and perhaps see the child more. When Tom Wood called to bid us good-bye, and was so sad that he   260     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, must go and leave John behind him still resting under that cruel charge, Emily came into the kitchen, and said, 'Auntie, -Tom says terribly hard things about judge, jury, and Oldbury folks.' "'Yes, deary,' I said; 'Tom has learned some bad ways in his sailor life. I am told thpat he swears; and I am sure that I smell cigar-smoke whenever he calls. I am sorry for little Stella.' "'She doesn't know anything about his' swearing, auntie; and as for his smoking, her father smokes too, and she is used to it. You could not make Stella believe that Tom isn't as infallible as Bridget at the Robins' Nest thinks the Pope to be. You know their friendship dates back to their early child- hood.' "'I like constancy in friendship,' I said; for, Esther, I wanted to see what the child would say. 'Well, she blushed as red as one   "OSS IS. SOMETIMES GAIN.  261 of your carnations. The arrow found its mark." "I have seen more than you suppose, sis- ter. She began by her sympathy for Ned; and you know what the poet says:- 'Pity is akin to love.' It was only last week she said to me, tAuntie, it seems dreadful to think so, but many people who once thought John innocent now begin to say that they fear he may be guilty.' Only thinks this fromn our Emma, who once told John that, let others think as they might, she never would lose faith in his honesty." Aunt Sabre dropped the peach she was paring, to wipe her eyes, which were filling with tears. Aunt Esther had taken her jelly, and, forgetful of the gruel she was to make, sat down to open her whole heart to her sister. "Sabre," said she, "have you noticed a diamond ring on Emily's hand?" I    262      CAPTAIN JOHN. "Yes, Esther; II found it on her bureau one day this week. On the inside are the letters, 'E. G. to E. M.'" "And she never said one word to me," said Esther, with a voice full of sadness. "I had hoped she might have mentioned it to you, Sabre." "Did we ever have any secrets from each other?" said Sabre. "Never," said Esther. "And now, sister, let me open my heart to you. I have always loved John. He has been a child to us, and we have not lost confidence in him. He will need friends when he comes back to the world; and where can he find any, save his own mother, who will love him as well? Mrs. Judge Hall said to me yesterday, 'I must congratulate you, Miss Esther.  If report speaks the truth, Emma will be mar- ried before long to our handsome Ned. The  match meets the approval of all friends.' It ,    .i    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   263 does not please me, Sabre. I cannot endure the thought of our birdie leaving the nest, and Ned is too ambitious to be satisfied with our little home. It may be foolish in me to have formed other plans; but I had done so. John has always said that he should take care of us in our old age, and I had hoped that, when the world looked coldly upon him, he would find love and shelter with us. You know that you and I are not fettered by the world's opinion. Two old maids may surely try to serve God and do right without incurring reproach or praise." The conversation of the two sisters was interrupted by the entrance of Emily. "Auntie clear, may I go to Boston with Mary to-day? Ned leaves to-day for Porto Rico, where he will spend the winter. The vessel sails from Boston this evening, at five o'clock." \r  *     264    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, The old ladies looked at each other, but neither spoke. Emily noticed the hesitation. "Emma, my dear child," said Aunt Esther, "I hope you will have no secrets from your Aunt Esther. She took you, when a babe, from your dying mother's arms, and would die to save you from sorrow." Emily burst into tears. "Oh, auntie!" she said, turning to Aunt Esther, "I never intended to conceal any- thing from -you; but Ned made me promise to say nothing to our friends at present." "Then Ned is wrong--all wrong," said Sabre, indignantly, a flush of real anger on her face, "to counsel you to withhold any- thing from the dearest friend you have on earth." "But, auntie, just think how much Ned has suffered! His-father thinks he will live but a short time, for his cough is so bad that   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   265 he hasn't slept one night for a week, and never gets any sleep -without an opiate. Can- not you see it yourself, auntie? He is so thin and pale! You must be thinking of John all the time if you have not seen that Ned is dying--that he will die if he stays here." The dear old ladies were full of sympathy' at once. They forgot all their own troubles in this fresh sorrow at the Robins' Nest. Yes, Emily might go to Boston with Mary, and Aunt Esther would go right over and see Mrs. Grant. The mother had not been unmindful of 'Ned's failing health. Her watchful eyes had seen the wasting of his body, the hollowness of his eyes, the fatigue after exertion, and the hacking cough. No word of complaint escaped him, and any inquiry after his health was answered with- "I do not feel ill. Do not worry about me."   266    CAPTAIN JON; OR, His father had often proposed a release from his duties Et the bank; but Ned would not listen to him. He felt better, he said, to be busy. The family had almost despaired of finding any way to relieve him, when he proposed, very unexpectedly to them, to spend the winter in the West Indies. Mrs. Grant felt like poor Jacob, and might well exclaim- Joseph is not, and will ye take Benjamin also?"But her affliction had softened and purified her, and she said to Aunt Esther,- "It is hard," she said, "but I have put my hand in that of my heavenly Father, and he will lead me through the darkness and the storm. He will do all things right." If this meek disciple had been endowed that day with the gift of clairvoyance, could she have seen what was taking place in the warden's office at the prison, she would have felt that God's ways are not our ways, and   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   267 that he often brings us to himself through dark valleys and over rugged crags. The name  of a new prisoner had been entered on the books. He was a man of middle age, a little below the medium height, slightly built, dark complexion, keen, black eyes, and a handsome mouth, on which a sneer had so long rested that his present humiliation was not able to efface it. His hands were small and white.  His name was H-iamlin, and he was in for forgery. Mr. Hart, the warden, stood six feet five in his stockings, broad-chested, with- a finely formed head, and neck well set on a pair of broad shoulders. Most men would. shrink from a personal encounter with him. His features were large, the eyes a deep blue and prominent, and the mouth indicative of great firmness; but the general expression of the face was grave and mild.   268     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Such was the personal appearance of the man who had almost supreme power over eight hundred men shut out from the world for their crimes. It is said that familiarity with crime hardens the heart; and an, inves- tigation into the management of some of our prisons has caused the merciful to turn away aghast at the secrets of these places of torment, misnamed Houses of Reformation. But Warden Hart was a merciful and just man.  Nature gave hinm strong nerves, an equable temper, and a large heart. More- over, he had learned of Him who was meek and lowly of heart, that kindness and love will often subdue the hardest criminal. "I wish to say one word to you, Mr. Hart," said the new prisoner. The warden looked at the man one glance, but it was a comprehensive one; he under- stood him.  He was not afraid of him, - 1 1 '          "OSS IS SOMETIIES GAIN.   269 though there was no one else in the office; but there was a guard just outside the door, and Hamlin did not stand between the door and the warden.  Mr. Hart noticed this; for, strong and athletic as he was, he had known such men as Hamlin, wiry and quick and of small stature, to spring like a tiger, and clutch their pray with all the venom and agility of that animal. "Whatever you -wish to say I will hear," he replied, to Hamlin. "You have a prisoner here, a young fel- low by the name of Grant-John Grant, sir."     * "Yes," said the warden, evidently inter- ested now, and willing to hear more. "He is in for stealing one thousand dollars from a Boston bank." "The same," said the warden; "and his term expires this spring." --'- -- r ur VILLI   270    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "Well, sir, he never committed the theft. I know the guilty parties and hold the proof. I confess this; for, bad, as I may be consid- ered by others, I think I could not sleep well under the same roof with that boy, knowing him to be innocent.  I had no ill-will against him myself; but I was so bound up with others in a certain transac- tion that I could not clear him without in- volving others." "And you have allowed this young man, only sixteen when he entered, to stay here nearly two years - two of the best years of his life! i As he spoke, such a look of scorn and contempt fell on the man, that he curled as if scorched by fire. "I was bound in honor to secresy." ' "iHonor!" said the warden. The word came from that great heart of the warden;   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   271 it was a round, full. chest tone, as elocution- ists say. "But -I must remember," he said, as he looked down on the man.   "Your confession is voluntary; I will not reproach you.  This paper, you say, contains the names of the guilty parties?" laying aside a note which Hamlin handed to him. "Yes; you will find a truthful account of the transaction in that paper." An hour afterwards, the warden read that paper alone in his office; and, while doing so, he exclaimed, - "Outrageous! Poor fellow! Cruel as the grave!" Mr. Hart was a father, and the reader will not be surprised at his indignation. He sent for John. The boy came, looking paler than in the old times Whow old and far away they seemed to him:now!), and without the merry smile he was wont to wear, but healthy still, and with an expression which I cannot define   272    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, otherwise than by saying it was a face that I would like to have near me in a storm at sea or in pathless woods. "John," (it was very pleasant to be called John - "How does the warden happen to say it?" thought John,) "here is a letter for you;" and - he handed him a sealed letter. Surely the warden is getting lax in his discipline. The letter was from Mary, stating that Ned was going to the West Indies for his health - would leave probably before this letter would reach John. In a hurried post- script she added, "A warm friendship has sprung up between Emily and John; and if he returns to us with recovered health I may have a sister. Who could be dearer to us than Emily?" John read the letter in silence, folded it slowly, and waited for what more the war- den should say.            /   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   273' ' John,"lsaid Mr. Hart, laying his hand upon the boiy's shoulder as he spoke, " your time is almost out; you have been here nearly two years, and not once have I had occasion to censure you. Your conduct has been worthy of all praise; indeed, I have sometimes thought you must be here by mistake." He paused. John did not speak, and the warden continued. "Now I hold in my hand the full proof of your innocence." John started.  The blood that had coursed slowly of late rushed in a fill tide through his veins, crimsoning cheek and brow. He turned his eyes, full of earnest inquiry, to the warden, but still he spoke not a word; he could not. There was almost as much pain as pleasure in hearing what he knew must come from Mr. Hart's lips. "John, do you know the guilty person?" "Yes, sir," said John.,   274    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Mr. Hart looked at the boy as if doubting that he had heard aright. "How long have you known this, John?" "I have known it for certain, sir, for two  weeks; since my cousin's visit to me - my  blind cousin, Willie; you may- remember him." "I shall not forget him. His music -was like what a seraph might give us if he left heaven to show us what music they have up there. He was at the house and played upon the organ." "Your allowed me to talk with him in this room, sir. He came purposely to tell me of something which took place in my father's bank the day before his visit." "Have you any objection to telling me what that was?" said the warden. John hesitated. "I will not urge it," said Mr. Hart; " but   allow me to ask did you suspect the truth from the first?" "Not till after the trial, sir. This man, Hamlin, was a witness and swore falsely." "Of course he did, but, as he says, not out of any ill-will to you; but because he was implicated with others, and rather than bring them' to justice he swore away your good name." John assented, but now his face paled and he looked troubled. "You need not mention the name, John; I will speak it for you.   Youtr brother Ed- ward took that money from   the package in his own office; you did not carry it to Bos- ton.  But Hamlin received it from him, and thus it came accidentally into Fred's hands. This Hamlin and your brother were engaged in sonme speculations together." "Oh, sir Iv Oh, Mr. Hart! The truth   ,276    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, would kill my father. Does he know it? Does everybody know it?" "No, my boy; do not be troubled. The only one who was knowing to the facts is this Hamlin, who is a prisoner in these walls; from him I had this paper. But how about your cousin Willie?" "Ah, sir, he is all right; W-illie will keep the secret. He promised me, and he would die sooner than break his word." "You must not remain here, John," said the warden. "A great wrong has been done which I will see righted at once;. Sit down here and we will talk it over." John took the offered seat, but he looked up at Mr. Hart with eyes full of entreaty. "It was very hard, sir, to come here when I knew that I was not guilty; to leave col- lege, lose my reputation, and be shut out from the beautiful world that I loved so well. If it had, not been for you, sir, I   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   2" think I should have died. Your kindness had made me forget my troubles sometimes. I cannot Itell you; you can never know that your face has been like a life-boat to a ship- wrecked sailor; you have been to me (ex- cuse me, I would not be irrevent) like our Saviour when he saved the sinking Peter. You have been so kind to me,- sir, may I ask one favor of you now?" "One favor, boy! I think you may, after having been a prisoner here two years for the crime of another. Speak freely. What is it, John?" "Please, sir, let me stay my time out and keep Ned's secret, if you will, sir. It would kill my father if he knew about Ned. Ned is high-spirited, and would have died here; indeed he -would, sir, and my father would not have lived a year. He is my father's favorite child; his pride. I was the young- est, and I think my mother loved me very   278    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, much, and. you know the oak will break when the willow bends. Her love was so strong that she loved me through all the shame and disgrace; if I had been guilty her 1ive would have risen higher, like the ocean tides in a great storm, and would have. overflowed any prison or dungeon where I might be placed. She is alive and well to- day. It is her love, her mother's love, that has kept her alive. There is only one love that surpasses it the love of Hirm who died to redeem us. If you will only let this se- cret remain with us, sir; at least till--till we hear from Ned.  He is sick now, sir, and has gone away from home." In his eagerness John had risen from his chair. The warden rose also and stood erect, his tall, manly form towered to its full height, and looked even taller than usual as he stood beside the slight figure uulahesto    Xsd   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   279 of the boy, whose eyes were now fixed upon him waiting for a reply. "Do I understand you, John? Are you willing to live with the stigma of this crime upon you?" "That will not be, sir. Ned is not wholly bad. He will confess it all sometime; I am sure he will; I am willing to wait. Perhaps you can explain it, --I cannot fully, -that when I came I was so indignant and angry with Ned that I could not think of him with any pleasure; but now that I have suffered for his sin I feel only pity and kindness for -him. Somqthingc which I read only a day before that unfortunate journey to Boston R 1 has helped me to bear it for Ned. Grand- father said at the time, 'This is our example; let us imitate it'; and being so much alone I have come to think of it a great deal: 'There was one who, amid all the sin and shame of this world, its hard routine, its   280    CAPTAIN JOHN ; OR, distortion, its bitterness, its falsehood, was always tender, always strong, giving his life for the race,'-the God-man, our Saviour, Mr. Hart."    - Mr. Hart drew nearer to John, threw his arm around him and said, - "God bless you, my boy; you teach me a lesson. - I thought I had tried to be like Him 'who died to make men holy.' I be- lieve that I was a good son and brother, but I have learned a new lesson of you." It is no disgrace to this strong, brave man that there were tears in his eyes as he spoke. These two were peers; the one bearing the badge of authority, the other in the- prison garb; the one in the meridian of life, tower- ing like Saul among men, the other a mere boy. Still they were peers in the realm of honor and true knighthood, made thus by God's own hand. "For the present, Johnj we will keep our   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   281 secret, nor will I reveal it without first con- sulting you. In the meantime, may I ask what you intend to do when you leave this place?" "I am going to sea, sir, with Tom Wood. He will return soon, and go the next time as captain of a vessel of which his father is part owner." "While you remain, John, you may act as my clerk, as you have done already at times. Come to me again in the morning. Good- night, now." "Good-night, sir," said John, and he passed out, thilking, I wish my mother could know how happy I am to-night." \   CHAPTER VIII. John's Prayer on the Ocean.- Remorse and Death of Ned. "DBURY, quiet, dreamy old town, is a restful place for the man of business who craves repose, for the man of letters who loves' study, for the poet who can weave unbroken webs of thought beneath the two thousand elm trees which shade its five-mile avenue, or for the invalid who finds health in the tonic of its sea-breezes. But life moves slowly here. The clocks are so ancient that they keep old-fashioned time.  The one nearest the centre of the town completed its one hundred and fortieth year only a few weeks since; and. events follow each other O \         }   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   283 here ill such slow succession that the reader will pardon the long intervals between my chapters. We left John in the warden's office. We meet him now on board the ship Whittier, bound for Calcutta, as mate for Captain Tom 'Wood, where we first introduced him to the reader. The secret is' still safe with the warden and Willie, and therefore John does not care to linger so long to gaze upon the old town, like Tom. A great many now believe him guilty who thought him innocent at the time of the trial. Tom sails his own ship now; and when he returns from this voyage, he will marry Stella. No wonder that life looks bright to him; but to John, no such bright future- shines for him. Aunts Esther and Sabre, Willie, and Stella Drummond are the same firm friends as ever. Grandfather Fletcher was kind, but his manner towards John was   284     CAPTAIN JOtiN; OR, lile that of a good man towards one who had suffered justly for a crime. Emily, his lifelong friend and the playmate of his child- hood, was very strange and fitful in her treatment of John during the two days that he was at, home.  One moment she was bright and sparkling as the gem upon her finger; the next, reserved and cold in her demeanor.  But the mother-- the loving, unselfish mother-that love was lile the spring in the desert to John.  If ever he raised an earnest prayer in his life, it was, as the ship parted anchor from the shore, that his mother's life might be spared till his return. His father mingled kindness and sternness in such a way as to almost break John's heart. The time of the ship's return was uncer- tain. She was to go direct to Calcutta, and take cargo from there to Buenos Ayres, where Tom had, connected himself with a   "OSS IIS SOMETIMES GAIN.    285 business firm, and was hoping for large re- turns from his investments.   He confided his plans to John. There were no secrets, save one, between these friends; their troub- les and joys were common-property. They had been some weeks at sea. They were in longitude 150 east, latitude 230 north, and it. was midnight. A strange feeling of restlessness, which came upon John often in these days, had driven him from his berth to the deck.  He never tired of the sea and sky. The motion of the vessel in the water made sweet music to -his ear, and the stars were a never-ending source of delight. He had watched them that night, as "Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels." His walk on deck quieted   his restless nerves, and there came over his soul such a   286    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, peace, such a trust in God, that, by the light of the binnacle lamp, he wrote the following in his memorandum book:- "ON BOARD THE 'WHTTIER,' "JULY 9, 18-, 12 o'clock, midnight. "As I walked the deck to-night, this pass- age came to my mind so suddenly that) it was as if a second person had whispered it, distinctly in ny ear:-' He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judg- ment as the noonday.' I prayed for brother Ned with my whole heart. All feeling of reproach and bitterness was taken from my heart, and, in its place, a pitying love, like a great wave, washed all resentment away. At the same time, I saw, more clearly than ever, the great wrong which he had done to me; but I saw it as if done to a third person and not to myself. I prayed 'that he might see it also, and seek pardon, through Jesus , I   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   287     Christ, for his great sin. I remained some time in prayer for Ned - only for Ned; not even my mother, whose image is always before me when I priay, came into my thoughts. I rose with such peace in my soul that I was bathed in it as in an ocean. God's world, the sea on which we sailed, and the thousand other worlds that rolled above me were all singing God's love to man." In the town of Mayaguez, Porto Rico, the clock struck the hour of seven P M., July 9th. It was the same time at which John was praying for his brother on the deck of the Whittier, though the clock, owing to different longitudes, struck another hour. A pale, emaciated young man is lying on a couch in a room that looked out upon the sea. The heat is very oppressive to him, though a light breeze blows through the latticed windows, and a jug of iced water,   288     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, brought in by a servant, stands beside fresh fruits and ices.  Nothing was, lacking to malke the invalid comfortable; but he is restless, and the heat overcomes him.   I wrote that he was pale; but on both cheeks there is a bright, hectic spot, and his great, beautiful eyes shine like diamonds, while his hair lies in great masses of white curls upon his head.  His hands, finely i shaped and delicate as a lady's, are clasped above his head. Pen, ink and paper lie beside him, and a half-written letter. He is so weak that he can write only a few minutes at a time; then he drinks a swallow of ice-water, and lies back upon, his pillow to rest, but only for a short time. A strong will drives him to his task. Life is flowing fast away, but as yet the bright waves break and dash, unconscious how soon'the tide will ebb, and the silent shore waits for them in vain. At last the letter is finished. He strikes a little   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    289 silver bell that stands beside him, and a servant enters the room. "Raffel, can you fold that letter and en- velope it?" "Yes, sir." The servant obeys. Once more the thini, wasted hands, on one of which a ringc glit- ters, are taken from his head, and he super- scribes the envelope.  As he does so, the ring falls upon the envelope.  He gazes at it an instant. "Raffel, hand  me the other letter- the 'one I wrote this morning." He places the ring inside, dds a short postscript, then lies back utterly exdhausted. The servant administers a soothing potion. "Send that letter to-morrow morningo, Raf- fel.  Put this one in this box (a small jewel box that was on the table), and  put it into my  trunk." "Can I do anything else for you, sir?" 19 t   290     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "When I die, Raffel, see that my trunks are forwarcled at once to illy father. I know I call trust you. Mr. Gomez will give you all necessary directions. I may die before he returns." "I hope not, sir. He comes to-morrow. You may get better yet, and go with your trunk." "I have no hope of that. Fan me, Eaffel; perhaps I can sleep." Raffel watched by him till he fell into a deep slumber, and then went out to mail the letter. NWhen he returned, in half anl hour, the invalid still slept-but it was that sleep which knows no walling. The same steamner which     bore Edward Grant's last letter to his father bore also the tidings of his death. The letters reached Oldbury one afternoon in tlhe two o'clock train, and were laid on Mr. Grant's table just before time for closing them bank. Rob-  "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    291 : ert, who was as punctual as Mr. Grant in all his movements, had closed the shutters for many years at the minute, and wondered what should detain the president so long alone in the directors' room. When the clock struck four, he ventured to look in. As he did so, Mr. Grant, who was sitting at the table, rose,' stood erect for an instant, I then tottered, 'and would have fallen, had not Robert caught him in his arms. Robert understood the attack, though ignorant of the immediate cause. His father had died after the third,attack of paralysis, and his mother was just recovering from her first. After a little vigorous rubbing, Mr. Grant was so far restored to consciousness as to be able to ride home. The clock struck five just as he was carried into the hall-the old clock in the corner. Mr. Grant heard, and mechanically put his hand to his watch- pocket to draw out hia watch. He could not-   292    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, do it. "No matter," he said, with a sigh , and permitted theml to carry hil to his room.  The family doctor pronounced it only a slight attack, from which he would rally in a few days. That night, as his wife watched by hie side, she readthe following letter: "MY DEAR FATHER,- I am dying. I an: glad that it is thus with me. I came here that I might die away from home, and ] hoped that the end would come sooner. ] wish to be buried here, far away from home and kindred. After the confession which ] must make, you will not wish to look upoI me when I am gone, or read my name in th( home church-yard. "I wish to be forgotten by all who have ever known me. I know God's love is inll finite. As I have lain upon this sick bed ] have recalled the lessons of my childhood  ..  . .   I        LOSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  293 I    and I have tried to seek pardon through Him who died for sinners; but my sin is so great that I have repeated again' and I   again the words of the publican, who dared not lift up his eyes to heaven, but cried, 'God be mercifill to me a sinner.' I never realized the greatness of my sin as I do now, though remorse for it has brought me to the grave. "Did  you never suspect, father and mother?  Was your confidence so great in me that you did not once think it possible that I might be the one who took that money from the bank, instead of John? "I had become involved in speculations of which you knew nothing, with Hamlin, of Boston.  We were unfortunate, and kept on, hoping to retrieve our losses. I used some  of the funds; but ill-luck continued to follow us. To conceal my transactions I made false entries. One sin led to another,   294    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, till I found myself involved in a web from which I could not get free; a web of false- hood and deceit in which my accomplice was determined I should remain. "Had I confessed my first departure from right to you, how much sorrow would have been saved. But I lacked the courage. At the time John went to Boston I had become desperate. Exposure would have been ruin. I did not deliberately plan to implicate him; do not believe I was quite so bad as that. I think I reckoned a little upon his careless- ness ; that he would leave the package some- where, and when found the missing notes would be supposed to have been taken by some one, or that the money would not be counted at once, on its arrival at the bank. But I was so desperate at the time that I hardly knew what I did. "It was the act- of a man driven 'to ex- tremity, with the hope that in some way I   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   295 could replace the money. I cannot tell you what H suffered during the trial. Hamlin came on and promised me that if John was convicted he would take the responsibility, as the money was used by him, and leave the country, after giving proof of John's innocence. I might have known that he who had tempted me to sin was not the one to help me out of trouble.  I have seen him but once since.  To add to my suffering, there was an accusingc angel al- ways near me. I had a suspicion which I could not throw off-that Willie believed me the guilty one.  He sought me daily, and I was sure at last that my soul was laid open to his second sight. Then I worked night and day to repay the money which I had takenl, resolving as soon as that was done to confess my crime and take John's place.  I had nearly done this when Ham- lin appeared one day in the office. Willie   296    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, was lyingo on a lounge in a little room ad- joillingi the directors' room. I did not know that he was there. Hanmlin wished to bor- row some money, and was angry at my refusal. He threatened to expose all our transactions to the world. "'Very well,' I replied, 'I am ready.

"'Cousin Edward, I knew this all the time. I was sure it must be so. Ilow can I ever forgive you, Edward? How can you forgive yourself?' "Those were all the words he spoke.

I found that I must die. Dr. Storer, whom I consulted in Boston, told me that I had but few months, perhaps weeks, to live. "I came here to die--with no hope, no wish to see my friends again. iMy presence would be a curse there. Farewell, father, mother, Mary! I dare not send even a fare- well to John--John, who has suffered so much for me! And yett, with his clear con- science, the iron gates of his prison have been like the massive pearls of the celestial city, compared with the homes where I have dwelt. I wish to have this confession as public as possible.

I have written this at intervals, and under the influence of stimulants. Oh, my father! .what suffering my love of gold has caused! I wanted to  be rich. Wealth seemed to me the greatest blessing this world could give, and I fell into that snare of the evil one. I am, truly, a dying thief, with no hope but in the mercy of Him who died to save sinners. John- dear John---I dare not ask him to forgive me; and- yet, even while I write, I seem to see his face, wearing the sweet expression of my mother, full of forgiveness and love. I dare not believe the vision. "I am unworthy to subscribe myself your son. Perhaps-perhaps, if you knew what I suffer, you -would not rebuke me if I write,    "Your affectionate son, "EDWARD GRANT." This letter was received on Saturday, and   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    299 read, as requested, on Sunday, in church, at the close of the morning service. No one present but Grandfather Fletcher and Willie knew of its contents. A  great stillness fell upon the congregation, and many faces were moistened with tears.  The minister made no comments; but, after foldingc the letter, he said, "Let. us pray."   The prayer that followed was a simple outpouring of thank- fulness to God, who had brought the guilty to repentance, and made the integrity of the innocent clear as noonday. When he prayed for the safety of the ves- sel that bore the loved ones of their flock upon the sea, that God, in good time, would return them to their homes, one fervent "Amen!" was heard inl response from all the congregation, though they were never before so demonstrative. It was, however, somewhat amusing, when the first excitement was over, to hear the ?                         O0    CAPTAIN JOHN; 'OR, amarks made.  As the c6ngrecation dis- ersed, some one said-- "Well, I, for one,  xpected it would turn out just so.", An- ther-- "I was certain, at the trial, that man [amlin perjured himself." Another--"These lose-mouthed folks are always the rogue s." Stella Drummond sought Emily; but the Itter could only keep repeating, - "Oh, Stella! Oh, Stella! I was blind and   t ruel." "I knew you were," said Stella. "Why Lid you not trust me when I told you that hat ring was the coil of a serpent?"A "I ought to die alone and be buried away - rom all my friends, too," added Emily. "It wouldn't be any too good for you, fter treating John in the strange way you lid when he was with us only two days." Little Stella was rather merciless to Emily. he had never forgiven her for her faithless-   "OSS IS SO-METIMES GAIN.  301 ness to John, and was willing she should suffer. "Take this ring, Stella; I can never wear it any more," said Emily, drawing the dia- mond ringv from her finger. "I wouldn't touch it anly sooner than I would touch the cloven foot," said Stella, starting away from her companion. Mr. Drummond and his wife were not at church. Stella came in and found them both in the drawing-room-her mothller on the lounge, asleep, her father smoking a cigar. She danced merrily in, and very saucily snatched the cigar from her father's mouth, and kissed him on both cheeks. "Father! it is all come out right, just like a story-book! It is as you and I believed all thetime--John is innocent!   Ned took the money.  He confessed it all; it is all in a letter.  I cannot. tell you about the letter; it is all too awful and solemn. Ned is dead,   302    CAPTAIN JOHN ; On, father; but he confessed it all before he died." "Stella! Stella i " said her mother, waking up from her sleep; "you forget it is the Sabbath -laughing and talking and dancing about so!" Stella ran to her mother. "No, I don't forget it is Sunday, mother. I do not think people ought to spend holy time in sleep. If they would go to church, they would hear good news." "You are a saucy little minx, Stella. Take off your hat, and let me box your ears!"---with an expression not quite in consonance with her words. Stella whisked off her hat, and bent her face down to her mother, who kissed her tenderly. "Now tell me about Ned and John, and the good news you have heard."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   303 Stella gave a more connected account of the letter, and ended by saying,- "Now, let us never talk about Ned any more. I am glad he was sorry for his sin, and I hope he will have a little corner in heaven among the repentant Peters and Manassahs and the thief on the cross, and only be permitted to look once a century on the Abels and St. Johns and the holy martyrs." Aunt Esther and her sister Sabre walked home in Silence, side by side. Aunt Esther once broke the silence by saying, - "Sabre, God's ways are not our ways. 'He has brought forth righteousness as the light, and judgment as the noonday.' " There was no more said.  Aunt Esther went to her own room, laid away her nice straw bonnet, with its broad ribbon of a delicate lavender tint, folded her Canton crape shawl, and then knelt and prayed. i   304     cAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Her heart was so full that only thus could she find relief. Sabre just looked into the kitchen to see if the meat which she had left. in the oven was not overdone; then exchancgincg a gray silk dress for a wrapper, began to sing-- "We're marching through Immanuel's land, To fairer worlds on high." "Grandfather, grandfather, please let me go home. I would rather not go to Uncle Edward's to-day," said Willie. "Robert may drive you," said the old gen- tleman. "I must be with my daughter Mary to-day; I will walk." Willie went home, sat down to his organ and played andi sung from Hande's Messiah 'Worthy is the Lamb," etc. A flood of melody filled the old parson- age, and the breeze bore it across the brook, where a few colored families lived. They all came out to listen. One man said,. "Oh 1.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.    305 but he- is happy." A boy who had waded into the brook as far as he could, that he might hear more distinctly, said, "Oh Dad I I'd give my eyes if I could make music like Willie Fletcher."' For an hotur it continued, and then Willie laid down upon the couch and slept such a sweet, deep  sleep that when his grandfather saw the beautiful face so calm in its repose he thought of these sweet words: "There is a face whose loveliness Was marred by hues of care;        [ -But sleep has swept it with his kiss, And made it smooth and fair." ['B'        As,    CHAPTER IX. Captain Tom's Misfortune.--Return of John from Sea.-Wel- come home.-- Stella Drummond's Decision. - Blind Willie's Death. --The Peace of a good Conscience. HE "Whittier" has made a fine ,lr^    run to Calcutta.  The captain has sold his cargo and reloaded with ?^ unusual despatch, and they leave for Buenos Ayres a week sooner than Cap- tain Tom had reckoned. "If we have such luck as this," he said to John, "we will be at home before they are ready to receive us." "I would like the good luck, Tom, but I am in no great haste to see Oldbury again." "Ay! But, Jack, I am," replied the cap- tain. "Wait a year or two, and you may 306   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   307 make a voyage that you will wish like Puck's girdle." John made no reply. What had life for him but stern duty, bravely done, with its reward beyond this world.  Tom's future was very bright. In all his wanderings over the sea he was daily drawing nearer to an "island of peace," with the fairy form of Stella as queen of the isle. He was very ambitious to make this voy- age a profitable one'. At Buenos Ayres he found business pressing, and he gave him- self wholly to it. He worked day and night. John remonstrated. 'Why, Tom," said he, "you are doing the work of three men; you will surely break down. Moderation is wisdom."                     I "I never mean to work so hard again, John; but you know the proverb: 'Make hay when the sun shines.' I am strong and 'healthy. Did you ever know me sick? Did   308    CA-PTAIN JOHN; OR, I ever stay away from school, except when I played truant, Jack? No fear of me." He was so much needed there that he sent the vessel, with John in command, on a trip of six weeks.  One half of the time had passed when Tom, who spent most of his evenings looking over accounts and writing, often sitting up at this business till the small hours, began to be affected with dizziness of the head and occasional severe pain. He was not alarmed at all, thinking it only the result of hard work, and he relaxed labor a little, but smoked the more. The pain in- creased in frequency, and was accompanied by dimness of vision, making it very diffi- cult to read or write by candle light. Tom still disregarded these symptoms, which were really avant-couriers to give him warning that something more- serious might follow. At last his eyes became so seriously affected   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN. . 309 that light was torture,- and- he was confined to a darkened room. When John returned he was surprised not to meet him bn the wharf. A servant came, instead, to say that the captain was troubled with weak eyes; not sick, hewas careful to add, as he had been ordered, but unable to bear the sunlight. John found him with his eyes bandaged and in a most-] ugubrious state. "Jack, you old fellow, H have waited for you with as much impatience as a child for its nurse. Here! tear off these bandages and let me look at you." "Please, sir," said the attendant, , the doctor ordered that they should not be re- moved for twenty-four hours." 'The devil take the doctorI Stop! I promised you, John, I wouldu't swear, and that is coming mighty near to it. Take off these bandages and let me look at you."   310    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, He was used to command and expected to be obeyed. The bandage was removed, and, for aught John could perceive, save a slight inflammation, Tom's eyes looked as bright and well as ever they did. "Why, Tom, I see nothing wrong about your eyes. I wish I had as fine a pair." But Tom did not reply. He was looking eagerly up, but could see only a shadowy form before him, but no distinct outline. Involuntarily he put out his hands. "John, I hear your voice, but you look like a ghost. Come nearer; I am not afraid of you." John noticed the extended hand, so much like Willie, and a terrible fear seized him. Tom put both of his hands out, drew John nearer to him, -nearer, nearer,- till their faces touched. "Yes, it is John. But I can't see you well, John; the calm look of your eyes, nor   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  3" the smile that was going to cheer me up so much. Oh John! what shall I do without your face to look at? Talk, John; sit down here and talk; close to me, John, so that I can lay my hand upon your shoulder. There, that is it. Now, Bob, tie these bandages on again.  These doctors are terrible tyrants." "But, Tom, what does this mean? Tell me all about it. What do the doctors call this?" "Some confounded hard Spanish name that it is not worth while to remember. But the truth is, John, I have had a little trouble with my eyes before; but it never gave me any concern. This climate and so much day- work, with writing nights, has laid me up at last. I haven't much faith in the doctors here, and we must get the vessel round to New York as soon as possible. They will make it all right there. Now, John, your   31 2    CAPTAIN JOHN  OR, being with me is what your Aunt Esther would call a 'special providence.'" "Not in answer to your prayers, I fear," said John, smiling. "No, John, it is an ' uncovenanted mercy.' Do you remember, years and years ago, that your grandfather used to thank the Lord, in his prayers, for 'covenanted and uncove- nanted mercies'? I couldn't make out what it meant, and went to mv mother for an, ex- planation. I suppose you are an uncove- nanted blessing to me; but, any way, if I cannot pray in faith, I Will not be so mean as not to thank the Lord for the blessing." After John had seen the doctor, who was really a skilful oculist, he felt thiat no time was to be lost in getting Captain Tom to New York.  Fortunately, the cargo was nearly ready, and they set sail in a few days, with rather heavy hearts. Tom was not yet aware of the real nature of his trouble. ^'   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   313 John understood it better, and trembled for the result. The return home was delayed by contrary winds, and poor Tom was confined to the cabin a greater part of the voyage. There was no lack of order on the ship. Every sailor had learned to respect and fear John; though Jack Bunltin would sometimes say to those in his mess-"Sec, when we get back to Oldbury, if we can't hold our heads as hitg as old 'Squire Grant's son!" As soon as the vessel 'made port, John mailed a letter to Oldbury. to Tom's father; and, in the meantime, Tom was placed under the care of Dr. Mann, who understood at once the nature of the case, and who was too honorable to hold out ally false promises. After consultation with John, it was thought best that he should know the truth; and the 'doctor frankly told Captain Tom   that he  -            .   314    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, must make up his mind to lifelong darkness. The blow was terrible, coming, as it did, to dash the brightness from his future life. He begged -them to leave him alone for a while, that he might discipline himself /to think of the reality. "At the end of an hour, come to me, John," he said. -When John came, punctually to the min- ute, he laid his hand upon his shoulder:- "John, there is one thing to be done before I go home. Get pen and paper, and let me dictate a letter. I will be honorable in my misfortune." John obeyed. "I have been thinking it all over. It need not be a long letter, because I shall see- no, no-never again; but she will see me' very soon. Are you ready, John?" "I will do what you Wish," said John; but he could scarcely articulate.   "O$ IS "OlE TIMS GAN.    315 Well, theii, writo as follows;h:- -DEAn S rELLA : A- Ar Srat irse tfortune has come uIIIpon me.

I write with John's eyes. - Ever your friend, "ToMi WOOD." Stella was in a measure prepared for this letter, by one from John to her father. She took it up to her own room, to the same little corner where she had written all her letters to Tom, and close to the box where all his letters to her werd laid, neatly tied with blue ribbon.  We icannot wonder at Stella's tears when she read this letter. She was a creature of smiles and- tears, fitful as an April day; but there was in her very fitfulness a promise of summer beauty and rich autumn maturity.  She blotted Tom's letter with her tears, then laid it one side, - took out her writing materials, and wrote as follows, her little fingers moving as rapidly as the tick of the telegraph: - %   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   317 "DEAR, WICKED, UNGRATEFUL TOM:--I 'have just finished reading your letter, and I cannot think of any words hard, enough to apply to you. If I had time, I would search the dictionary for somb trenmendous ones, as young Lawyer Dunn did when he made his first speech. And so, because a great trouble has fallen upon you, I am not to be allowed to help you bear it I Oh, Tom I could you think it was in my heart to take advantage of your permission to release myself from my engagement to you? It is unjust to me, and unkind to yourself. 'My bright life twined with your darkness'-- what does the poet say?"'All things in two lines of glory run-ebon and gold, sunlight and shade;' :and if I have any brightness, you will need it. now more than ever. No; Tom, no! I shall be true to my engagement; it was made' solemnly, before God, to you. Let the wedding-day be the same that we named !              o   318    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, the day before you went to sea. You will need me. This is the one comfort to me in our affliction.-, Little Stella Drumlmond will now be of some use in the world; heretofore she has been called a little singcing-bird, fit only to be petted. Well, perhaps singing- birds have their uses, or God would not have made them. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom, to say that you will wear my ringc only in memory of a past happiness. That sounds like Deacon lHolcome's' funereal remarks,' as he called them, after the death of his third wife. I hope you will be sin- cerely sorry for them, and confess your sin. I cannot help it if you use John's eyes at present; and I am willing to trust him with our secrets, for he has shown that he can keep a secret well. Isn't it beautiful to think how nobly he has suffered for another? I suppose you know all about it by this time; but the people here are never tired of talking I  -'   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   319 about him. We are waiting his return with much impatience. It will not be long, Tom, that you will need any person's eyes but mine; and they already belong to you 'till death do us part.' "Yours ever, "STELLA DR]UMMOND. "P. S.-I took my letter down stairs, and showed it to father. X When he had read it, Tom, he drew me close to him:--'You could do no less, my daughter. I put my- self in Tom's place, and think how terrible it would be to lose my sight, and such a dear little jewel as yourself, also. You are right. I dare not counsel you to do otherwise; and yet, I fear you are not brave and strong enough for this.' "'If I am right I shall be strong,' I said, 'and God will help me.' "My mother wept and was silent.  My father sends his love, and says, Tom, that   320    CAPTAIN, JOHN; OR, he cannot spare me yet for years, but you must come to us, and we will all be very happy together. Isn't he a noble man? I crowned him with my arms, and put a star, my kiss, upon his brow. Once more, Tom, I subscribe myself "Yours ever, "STELLA." "When John read this letter to Tom, the latter bowed his head and was silent for a, moment in the fulness of his joy. "Read it again, John, slowly; dwell upon each word as if you were a Jew handling diamonds." John obeyed. Then Tom rose and walked the room. "John, this must not be! It is too great a sacrifice. She must not bind that young, joyous life to mine. I will forbid the banns. I will be strong, and suffer alone."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   321 "And render her life wretched?" asked, John. "You say that, John.  Do you think it 'would be right?" asked Tom, eagerly. e If I have read Stella Drummond aright, Tom, you will find that she will be happy only in living for you. Beneath all thQ sparkle and gayety of her nature there are deep, clear waters that will make your other- wise barren life fresh and green. You are already one by solemn promise, in the sight of God; your lives are joined for better or for worse, and the minister who pronounces you man and wife at the altar only confirms what you have already sworn to each other. Take the gift God sends you, and be the better manll for the blessing.:" While John spoke he held in his hand another letter, with seal yet unbroken, from his mother. He now read as follows:    322    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "  MY BELOVED SON, -I long to see you. My poor weak heart needs your presence and strength. Grandfather has written you some particulars which -will prepare your mind a little to meet your friends. Mr. Drummond informs me that Tom will come by rail to-morrow, and that you will bring the vessel round on Thursday. "Your father has changed somewhat since your brother's death. I mention it that you may not be surprised to see that timel and sorrow will affect our tabernacles of clay. I wait impatiently for Thursday. "Your affectionate mother, -t MAnY GRANT.' "There she is, Tom. She has got beyond the outer buoy, and is coming up river. She is a fine vessel, Tom." "She is a beauty, Stella. I was very proud of her."   "OSS IS SO:METIMES GAIN.   323 They were sittingy in the observatory. Stella was watching through the glass the Whittier come iu, and reporting its progress to Tom. "Now I see the flag; now the main-top- mast studding sail. She comes in like a queen, Tom.- I can see her very clearly, and the men on dleck. The boat is on the davits; now she has made the wharf. There is a great crowd gathered there. I can see old 'Squire Brown; he has left his chaise and is walking as fast as Falstaff going to meet Prince Hal. There is a close carriage near the wharf; that contains Grandfather Fletcher and Willie, I guess.  The crowd increases. Now the brig has. come up close to the wharf, and  the men are reefing sail. Somebody conmes ashore.' Ay! that is John.   Hark! do you hear that" shout? It sounds as if every man and boy in Oldbury had a voice in it.  There I another. They are all sur-   324     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, rounding John. 'Squire Brown is so fat he can't make his way through the crowdv; now he has got near, and is saying something to him. Now John sees the carriage and goes to it; he lingers a moment; now he has gone back to the vessel, and I can see a coach with two elegant horses stopping at the head of the wharf. Your father is there; he motions for John to get in, and he goes down to the ship. Anoth'er shout. How it rings through the air. The carriage is driven off in the direction of the Robins' Nest, and the crowd has dispersed,"' "This is John's welcome home, Stella," said Tom. "He deserves it, but he cares little now for such demonstrations; I never saw a fellow who thought so little for self. He has some motives to action which I can- not understand." 'He is- a Christian, Tom," said Stella, with a grave look on her pretty face.   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   325 "None of your common sort, Stella. He never talks about his religion, but I believe he would die to save men from going wrong. There was a great chancrge in, my men after John came aboard, and yet he never once" talked to a fellow for swearing, or made as if he was any better than the worst of 'em. But somehow I couldn't swear when John was round, and the men felt pretty much so; all but Jack Buntin. He is the ugliest fel- low on the ship. I would have discharged him just for giving John an evil look, but- ,John belgged me to keep him. Wonder what the rascal will think and do now, for he always would believe that John was guilty." Once more the house was all in readiness for John, and this time there was no disap- pointmelnt. Their joy was .like all our deep- est happiness- born of sorrow. John was shocked to see the great change in his father. His hair was white, his form bowed, and his   326    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, motions constrained and slow; but his "God bless you, my son. I have longed with my whole heart to see this day," brought tears to the eyes of his son. Mary was altered too; there were gray hairs on her young brow. But the mother: The same calm, sweet face, lovely as ever in her plain black dress and mourning cap.  She could say little, but the love looked out of her eyes; and she told Aunt Esther afterwards that when she heard John's firm tread in the hall, and saw how manly and strong he looked, she felt as if the "strength of the hills" had come to her. It was well that Bridget came in and made a ripple in the strong, deep emotion of this meeting. She had been so long in the fam- ily that she was allowed some liberties. She came in with her clean white apron over her- dress, and red bow in her hair, and returned John's "I am glad to see you here still,   Bridget," with "And aint it a plashure to see yes back wid your foine face and that swate moostage?" Grandfather Fletcher and Willie came to dinner. They had spoken at the wharf; but now the good old man took both of John's hands in his own and said, - "My boy, it is not often that age asks pardon of youth; but here now, as one of those who, have sinned in suspecting you, I ask your forgiveness; give it to me before I. die." "Grandfather," said John,- taking one of the pale, trembling hands and laying it upon his head, "bless me as you once did, before I went to college." ' The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long,"' said the old gentleman --the same passage which Aunt Esther had given him in the day of his greatest sorrow.   .   328    CAPTAIN JOHN*, OR, As for Aunts Esther and Sabre, on this eventful day their joy was so great that the one put on her bonnet to go and carry some- I   "     ' '  ' thing very nice to half a dozen of her poor proteges, that they might have a little thanks- giving at the event; and Aunt Sabre made the kitchen redolent with spice cake and waffles, because John would come to tea. John was too busy with the vessel for that, but he came in the carriage to take them all to the -Robins' Nest to spend the evening. The two old ladies went with him; but Emily was shut up in her room with a head- ache, and begged them to leave her. She would sleep awhile, and wanted no one with her. And so there was no music that even- ing; for Willie, whose health was very frail now, went home early   and John   liad longed, all the way home, to hear Emily sing! There was a very quiet wedding at the   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   329 beautiful house on the Ridge. Stella would have it so, because Mr. Grant's family were in mourning, and she could not be married without them. The next day after the wed- ding, John returned with the vessel to Buenos Ayres, to attend to Tom's business there, but was to return in a steamer. A year passed. John would not quit his post till he had, by careful management and close attention to business, realized all and' more than Tom could have desired, receiv- ing only for- himself the wages of a sailing- master. Thus was one more year of his life, devoted to another; but he was happy in his work, and never in better spirits or health than when he landed in New York, one brigrlht October day, from the steamer Her- cules. He was hurrying up Broadway to a hotel, when he met his old friend, Warden Hart. -They had not met since John bade farewell to his prison life.   330    CAPTAINT JOHN; OR, "Captain Grant, as true as I am alive! They call you so now, I believe. You see I have heard about you, and, what is more, have written you half a dozen letters in the last six months, but have received no answer to any of them." "You certainly would if I had received them," said John. "Are you going up town?" said the warden. "I have just come from the steamer, and was seeking a hotel." "Come with me, then, to the Astor. I have a proposition to make to you. There is a fine steamer just completed by a reliable company, to run from here to Liverpool; and I am commissioned to offer you the position of first officer. I know you under- stand all about the matter; haven't I the models which you made in those old days, John?" A    "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   331 John did not reply immediately. He -had lost the quick, careless way of his boyhood, and was as remarkable now for caution and reticence as he had formerly been for haste and carelessness. "No haste in giving an answer.  Come and have dinner with me, and talk it over," said his friend. After remaining in the city some days, and learning more of the company, John agreed to accept the position, and went to Oldbury to spend a few dayrs before his departure. The day after his arrival, Mrs. Grant handed him a box which had belonged to Edward, but had not been opened since his trunk -came from   Porto -Rico. It contained a watch, some diamond shirt studs, sleeve but- tons, and a letter was carefully laid in the bottom of it, in which was a plain gold ring. There was no direction on the letter, and John opened' it and read the followings sen-   332    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, tence, which was the .first that met his eye: -"In my utter misery, I turned to music for some diversion in the hours which I could not -devote to business. Goaded on, as I was, by the determination to make up to the bank its losses by my speculations, I must now and then turn my thoughts in some other channel, or insanity would have fol- lowed. In one of those hours, I was tempted by Satan to ask you to change rings, and promise that, some future day, if John should never return to Oldbury, - and I assured you he would not,-you would unite your destiny with mine. By slow degrees, step by step, I destroyed your confidence in him, and led you to doubt not only his honesty but his, friendship. I was more cruel in my friendship than I had been in my business relations. You will know, before you receive this, that John is true and good,'and as true to his early friendship- /   "OSS IS SOaMETIMES GAIN.   333 as he was in his relation as son and brother. I send you back this ring, for you gave it to me, only that I had marred the true image of John which had always been dear to you from childhood. For his sake - because I was to you then the nearest to your oldest and truest friend, my brother"- John read no more. He folded the letter, enclosed the ring, and forwarded it at once to Emily, for whom  it was evidently in- tended. The faithful Raffel had put it in the box, but had not noticed the envelope, which Ned, in his feebleness, had dropped upon the bed after writing the superscription, too weak to enclose and seal it. The envelope was found some days afterwards, when the trunk was emptied of its contents. Some days afterwards, John was at the parsonage. It was a warm,' sunny day in June, but Wilhe was lying on the lounge in the library, too feeble to rise from 'it.   334    CAPTAIN JOHN ; On, He had been gradually- failing for a year. The excitement and anxiety which he suffered during John's confinement had been too much for his delicate constitution, and his -grand- father said that, from the time of Edward's letter, he had been lgrowing weaker. The hope of seeing John once more had sustained him for awhile, aided by the unceasing care of Emily, who spent all her days with him, playing for his amusement, singcring again and again the ballads which he loved so much, or reading his favorite books. Emily had lost the bright, happy look of other days, but she was growing more and more unselfish every day, living for others- a second and improved edition of Aunt Esther, Captain Tom said. When Stella ventured, one day, to rally her a little upon her quiet, maiden ways, so much like her aunties, Emily replied,-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   335 "I pray God daily to make me like them, and give me strength to do good as they have done." There was a sigh, though, as she said this; and- Stella echoed the sigh, and added, - "Captain John talks just like that." Stella was, if anything, gayer and brighter than before her marriage--the sunshine of the house.  She prepared her husband's food, read the papers to him, walked and rode with him; in short, was a second self, learning to understand business, that she might write for him; so that it was a com- mon remark in Oldbury, that a man might be willing to lose his eyes, if he could wear such a jewel as Stella. But we were at Willie's side. Emily had been with him; but when John came in, she gave up her seat at the side of the couch, and went out to help the housekeeper, who was getting old and infirm, to prepare sup-   336    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, per. Willie could talk with difficulty. The blue veins could be seen through the trans- parent skin, and the thin, white hands had hardly strength to hold the bunch of helio- tropes which Emily had brought for him that day. His face was beautiful to look upon when John sat down and laid his hand upon his shoulder, expressing a love stronger than death itself:-"Oh, Johnnie dear, I prayed that I might live to hear your voice again. I think I shall be a little happier in heaven when you get there; I shall see you then. I can hardly understand so great a happiness. They tell me you have grown tall and manly, and I fancy you look like--like-one of my noble anthems. Come, put your ear a little nearer to me, Johnnie. I want to say something to you before I die, for I am going soon-only waiting to be with you a little longer. There, let the heliotrope lie near me, and you hold my hand."   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   337 Then followed a conversation, carried on in very low tones, intended for no other ears; but when the old gentleman came in, and John rose to greet him, Wilhe said, - "Before I die, Johnnie, let it take place, will you?" "If it lies in my power, Willie," was the reply.  That evening John and Emily walked home together as they used to do when children. Two weeks from that -time there was a great commotion in Aunt Esther's usually quiet house. Sabre was in the kitchen, and Aunt Molly, a colored woman, known all over Oldbury for the wonderful cake and pastry she could manufacture.  Sugar and spices, fruits, fresh and dried, and all manner of nice "ingregences," as Aunt Molly called them, delighted the hearts of these two artists--for artists they were. in their sphere.   338     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, Aunt Esther was up stairs and down stairs and in the lady's chamber, where Emily, very still and sweet, was engaged with a dress- maker.  The wedding day was appointed, two days before John was to take command of the steamer. It was to be a large wed- ding. Willie asked that it might be as large as Aunt Esther's house would admit; that there might be music and gladness; "for," said he, "Emily is entering a new world to her; a world across the sea; and I ani pass- ing over to a world brighter still. We will part in gladness, not in sorrow; for no one can mourn because the Master is about to say to blind Willie, 'Receive thy sight'; and I shall die more peacefully if I can see the two that I love best on earth united." There were -many bridal presents made. The most valuable was a solid silver service, given by the directors of the bank to John. "They actually took both hands from their   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   339 money bags," Stella said, "and gave gener- ously." "Let it be no plated stuff," said old 'Squire Brown, " but solid metal throughout. like Captain - John himself. I never made a greater mistake in my life than I did about that young fellow, and I am willing to show my regret; solid silver, gentlemen, and I will takle two shares"; and the old gentle- mall sat back in the biggest arm-chair in the room, took out his gold snuff-box and carried a .little to his nose, but scattered much of it on the broad cambric ruffles of his shirt bosom and on the ample breadth of his buff waistcoat. The service was beautifully engraved with designs from- the sea-shells -and mosses, ships and anchors. On the same day that it was sent to Aunt Esther's there came, in the shadow of twilight, a knock at the porch door. Aunt Sabre was taking the last loaf of cake from the oven, and opened the door   340    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, as soon as she had withdrawn the cake from its pan. Jacli Buntin stood there with a little pack- age in his hand. Aunt Sabre had not seen the man for years, though she had known the family for many years. Poor Jdck looked battered and rough and worn, like a poor worn-out vessel that had weathered the ocean storms for many years; .and yet Jack was not two years older than John. "Come in, Jack," said Aunt Sabre, kindly. "No, ma'am; excuse me. I brought Miss Emily a little present for her wedding day. I thought maybe she would take it from me, if I am. Jack DBuntin," handing Aunt Sabre a small box. "Good-night, ma'am," and Jack was gone. The box contained a white crape mantle, exquisitely embroidered in white; a dainty thing, that the most fastidious lady in the land might like to own. It must have cost   "OSS IS SOMETIMTES GAIN'. 341 Ja(ck a month's wages. No gift touched John's heart like this. "I cannot understand," said Aunt Sabre, "how Jack could have selected this; I should have expected a yellow crape em- broidered in red." "Don't you remember his mother?" said Aunt Esther; "the poor crushed, broken- hearted thing, tortured to death by that brute of a drunken husband? I used to go and see her when she was sick; and one day I carried her some flowers; they were lilies of the valley. I never shall forget how she cried over them, and said, 'Miss Esther, I used to love these when I was a girl, and wear them in my hair'; and I told her she should have a bunch of them every day while they were in bloom, and this very Jack was with her at the time. I told him to come every day and get them, and he did so while they lasted."   342    CAPTAIN JOHN; On, "Your lilies have returned," said Emily, as she stood examining the mantle. "Here are lilies of the valley embroidered on the mantle." "I am more and more convinced," said Esther, "that there is some way to touch every human heart, if we can only find it, to lead them to a better life. WTre mustn't lose sight of Jack now; he has been the worst fellow in town." "He has not drank a drop of spirit, nor sworn an oath, for six months," said John. "I have great hope for Jack." "Stella, I am  not worthy of him," said Eminly, as her friend was helping to dress her for the bridal. "I am  not worthy this happiness," and the tears were dropping on the white satin. "Emily, I cannot have those tears; they will spoil the satin. Of course you are not   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.  343 worthy of him. I am surprised that you never thought of that before. I will go right down and tell him, if you wish; and if he is as truthful as he has been all his life, and has his eyes open, he will agree with you. Why, Emily, there is but just one man in the world better than John; but I don't shed tears because Tom is so much better than I am, but thank the Lord every day for his goodness to me, and try to grow good like him; and that is the advice I give. you." At that, Emily smiled; for, in her own heart, she had placed John on a higher pedestal than Tom. Wilhe was at the wedding. He sat in a large easy-chair while the ceremony was performed, and heard the old-fashioned hymn sung which Aunt Esther said was sung at the wedding of John's mother- "Blessed be the tie that binds "- -   344    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, and was then carried home to the parsonage, which he never left again till he was carried, a week afterwards, to lie' by his mother in the church-yard. I give the description of Captain John as expressed by another who was present at the departure of the steamer:--- "As we were about to start, I saw the captain move to an elevated position above the wheel; and it was interesting to see how quickly and completely the inward thought or purpose alters the outward man. He gave a quick glance to every part of the ship. He cast his eye over the multitude coming on board the ship-the husbands and wives, the mothers and children intrusted to his- care; and his splendid form, as he gave the orders for our departure, seemed at once to grow more erect and firm. The muscles on his face swelled; his dark eyes glowed with a new fire, and his whole per-   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   345 son expanded and beautified itself by the power of inward emotion. I have often noticed this interesting phenomenon, and have come to the conclusion if man or wo- man either wish to realize the full power of personal beauty, it must be by cherishing noble hopes and purposes; by having some- thingl to do and something to live for which is worthy of humanity, and which, by ex- panding the capacities of his soul, gives expansion and symmetry to the body which contains it." All this was true of John, but more still should be said. The homely little Jack Grant had become a noble-looking man, partly because he had cherished noble aims and purposes, and had hard work to do. But he had taken One for his model whose life was perfect, and John had thus learned that the way of the cross, by which he leads us, is the way of peace. His model was   346      CAPTAIN JOHN. One who, amid all the sin and shame of this- world, its hard routine, its distortion, its bitterness, its falsehood, was always ten- der, always strong, giving his life for the race; full of faith in God the Father, fall of hope for man; without disguise, without pretence; the God-man, our Saviour and our example.   CHAPTER X. "Let go, and haul! 'tis the last command, As the head sails fill to the wind once more; Astern and to leeward lies the land, With the breakers white on the shingly shore." SEVEN years after the first trip of the steamship Neptune to Liver- pool, a party were gathered by the sea-side near Oldbury.  It was a warm June day; the tent was on the beach, but young or old cared not much for its shelter at this beautiful sunset hour. The little ones with bare feet were watching with eager eyes the incoming waves that tried to steal their  little white toes and carry them off to sea, while the older persons were 347   348    CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, seated on the sand, watching the restless sea that is never still, and yet never wea- ries the eyes that watch its ebb and flow. On a piece of carpet where cushions and pillows had been arranged by some careful hand two old ladies reclined, one of them in a widow's cap and black dress, the other in a soft, gray dress, with a dove-colored rib- bon on the straw bonnet which lay at her side. Aunt Esther was now nearly eighty years of age, but there was in her face a look of perpetual youth, - the expression which an  unselfish' loving, Christian life gives to the aged,--beautiful as the sun- set glory of the sea, when the king of day is bidding the earth farewell. The lady at her side has known much sorrow, but it has been a chastening; not grievous, but meekly borne; and now in a serene old age she canl sway, -- "Esther, dear, I  can see all the way in   "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   349 which the Lord hath led me, and I can say, (It is well.' " "There have been some dark days in our lives, Mary," Aunt Esther replied. "I mur- mured in the wilderness, when John was falsely accused and imprisoned; but now I see God's love even in that. It led our poor Ned to repentance. John said to me at the time that he, understood something of the love and the sorrow of our Lord; of the great fact of the atonement, which has anal- ogies in human life, weak and finite, but enough to make us comprehend the joy of giving one's life to redeem the sinner." As they talked, two men, arm in arm, were walking the beach, both of them of erect bearing and firm tread; but one car- ried a cane. This one was rather short and stout, but with a broad chest, and a face full of energy and vigor. You might talk with him some minutes before you would ,  *    '     '  s    *   350     CAPTAIN JOHN OR, \                \ perceive that those fine eyes were sightless. Few men are happier than Captain Tom; and now that Captain John has settled down in Oldbury, in the Robins' Nest, he says that he forgets his blindness for one hour every day at least, when they walk arm in arm, going each morning to the Post office and the reading room. "Mamma, mamma, is it true what Etta tells me? that there are beautiful ladies down deep in the ocean, that live in little caves all bright with gold and jewels, and that the ladies wear green silk dresses, and have long shiny hair, and come up some- times and sit on the rocks and sing so sweetly that the sailors sail their ships so close to the rocks to hear the music that they are dashed to pi'eces? Is it true, mother?" The question was asked .by a little bright- eyed fellow of five years of a lady dressed   \ "OSS IS SOMETIMES GAIN.   351 in white, wearing a scarlet sacque and a beach hat, around the crown of which was twined a bright ribbon.    v "Why, Freddie, darling, has Etta been telling you more of her strange stories?" "Yes, mamma; she tells 'em to me all the time; I don't like them. I want her to tell me about real ships, and how sailors climb up the mast, and how papa used to go way off and come back again with a ship- load of goods, and sell them for ever so much money;' and about Uncle John's great steamship that hasn't any sails, and goes puff! puff! through the water." "We will go and find your sister," said the lady, and ask her to tell you some other stories." "Real, true stories, mamma." A few steps brought them to a little cove, where Etta, a little girl in a bright frock, with sunny curls and laughing blue eyes, a, '                  -   352     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, was ma-king a grotto of shells and sea moss, and singing-  ' I would be A mermaid fair, Singing alone; Combing her hair Under the sea, In a golden curl, With a comb of pearl, On a throne." "There, mamma," said the little fellow, triumphantly, " please make her sing ' I'll-be- a sailor Bold and free, Standing aloft On the high cross-tree.'" "Oh mamma!" exclaimed the little girl, "do come and see my grotto, and all the. beautiful shells I have found." The bright, happy  child, was another Stella. The three sat down upon the sand, and were singing Freddie's song for him, when Uncle John came along with his wife,   "OSS IS SOMETMES, GAIN.   353 our Emily of former days, now a quiet, staid matron, leaning upon Chptaia Tbm's arm. .The latter stopped a moment to listen. "There! Emily is the music that keeps: my heart beating, I verily believe. I can- not see my wife and children; but, thank God, the music of their voices is to me- what sunlight and smiling faces are to you.. There are compensations iii life. I now un- derstand what 'Willie, used to say;- whce God takes away one sense he makes its loss: good by giving us more enjoyment with the. other four." Captain John was looking through a gnlass at a ship that had just left port, and was working her way over the bar to the open sea. They all gathered round him, even his mother and Aunt Esther, to watch her progrcss, while Captain Tom, without one sha:dow on his face, sung   354     CAPTAIN JOHN; OR, "And so off shore let the good ship fly; Little care I how the gusts may blo'wr Ina my fo'castle bunk, in my jacket dry, Eight bells have struck and my watch 's below."' "I never see a -ship leave port," said Esther, "without thinking- of the   human soul starting on its voyage of life.  Sun- shilne and tempest, storm  and calm, await it. Shoals and quicksands, sunken rocks, and dangerous harbors, are all waitingl to destroy; false lights and false colors, to lead astray. But above all He rules who holds the waters ill the hollow of his hand, and who said to the stormy waves, 'Peace l be still."' t Yes," said Captain John's mother, "and my favorite hymn is dearer 'to me thanl ever- "When through fiery trials our pathway shall lie, Thy grace, all sufficient shall be our supply; The flame shall llot hurt - Thine only design Our dross to consume and our gold to refine.
