Christine- and Zoe, after a long-tried friendship, and the experience of many changes and bereavements, came at last to make themselves a modest home together in a remote and quiet New England m town. Christine was nearly fifteen years the elder  of the two; but even Zoe's youth wa waning. In character they were extremely unlike. Christine's temper was naturally sweet, and her spirits elastic; and the discipline of life, -though severe, had scarcely marred the seren- ity of the one, or injured the spring of the. other. She had been fair when she was young, and had a sinogularly gracious and engaging presence still. The pomp of her   6-       ASPENDALE. *early comeliness had fallen from her like the' gay Petals of a flower; but the symmetrical fruit of permanent character, ripening and softening day by day, and gathering warmer tints from life's meridian sun,'was hardly less beautiful to behold. She was a person of unusual mental gifts; yet, with those who knew her well, the grateful, restful thought of' her included no distinct consciousness of her intellectual superiority. It is certain that the expressions " a man of genius," " a woman of genius," convey an irresistible idea of some- thing glorious maybe, but outr6; defiant of the prevailing order of nature, beautiful but monstrous. Now Christine was always, and above all things, harmonious,--in herself,* with her surroundings, with the human beings of every kind and condition among whom she was thrown. That such a woman, with so large and finely toned a nature, and so mild a magnetism, should be almost' entrely-with- drawn from what, among us, is called society, seemed matter of great regret to some. "So- / -         ^   ASPENDALE.       7 ciety," in truth, has bitter need of such exam- ples; but when the sad permission to choose a home was finally accorded to' Christine, she turned instinctively to the thought of a rural and a qut one. Her means were narrow. She was entering the afternoon of life. She had borne the burden of the day quietly, and, to all appearance, lightly; but the day had been hot, and the burden heavy: and in the depth of her patient heart there was an unspoken longing for rest. Her younger companion felt, or believed herself to feel, equally ready for retirement; but, then, Zoe's was one of those tidal natures, where power 'of all kinds, bothW mental and physical, - to achieve, to endure, to hope, and to enjoy, - is subject to periodic ebb and flow; and the peace she now formally made with life was -not necessarily final. She, too, had special capabilities of a rather uncommon order, and by those who knew them both was held more brilliant than Christine; yet it should be remembered that vivid and some-   8       ASPENDALE. times dazzling contrasts like those her mind displayed are far more* readily appreciated than the diffused and steady light of an intel- ligence like her friend's. Morally, she was of a proud, impatient, but not ungenerous type. Her spirit was high, so was her temper. She had, in fact, an electric nature, full charged, on most occasions, with the conditions of storm; and her history had been rendered almost tragic by the fact that these conditions seemed often to develop themselves- sponta- neouslyin defiance of her will, by the mere contact jwith a dissimilar human sphere. Christine, however, had been warmed and cheered, but never scorched, by her compan- ion's unruly fire. The two cherished one another with that rational and refined devotion sometimes exhibited by magnanimous lovers of the same sex; and when they applied to their long attachment the sovereign test of a life together, they had good reason to hope for its success.  Their little place -was called Aspendale,   r .-, ASPENDALE,       9 from the silver-leaved abeles which a predeces- sor on the spot had planted at the entrance of their glen. These trees had spread rapidly, As according to their wont' so that now you ' wound into the valley between white and shimmering masses of foliage, finely relieved against the native grovyth of nut-trees and hemlocks. The plain old farm-house where they were to dwell was of the ordinary New England type, with a porch in front, opening on either side into a large, low, panelled room-; and the beauty of its situation was extreme. The green hills closed it in on every side exdept the southern, where you saw, beyond the church-spires of a neighboring town, a long, blue reach of level country; and also at the north they parted just enough to reveal- the bold spurs and granite head of the one genuine mountain which the region owned. A straggling orchard iose behind the house; a sunny slope adorned with a single weeping- elm lay- before; and the brightest and most talkative of all swift brooks sped throughhe valley,   10      ASPENDALE. The charm of this seclusion was in no wise impaired by the fact that it was to some extent delusive. Twice a day the subdued shriek of a locomotive was audible behind the eastern downs; and, emerging from the mazes of the ahele grove, you beheld, with a kind of perennial surprise, a virtuous-looking village, not half a mile away. Its very church-tower was hidden from the dwellers at Aspendale, by one of their guardian hills; nevertheless, it was indispensable to those gentle hermits, as a base both of moral and physical supplies. Here they had plenty of neighbors, - for Christine's associations with the valley farm, were lifelong, - and some few precious ffiends. Prominent among the latter was the good physician of the place; a pious, positive, kind- ly, choleric soul; clear-headed, single-hearted (only the most bigoted of free-thinkers would have added narrow-minded); a man of un- usual sagacity in his profession, who coolly appropriated a moiety of the imposing discov-   ASPENDALE.      " eries amassed by the ear-sighted research of modern days, and bla, or supposed himself. to blow, the residue into space with one whiff of his mighty lungs. Him, from a marked peculiarity of feature, and , a catechetical method he had of enforcing his views, a way- ward disciple had once dubbed Socrates; and among his intimate friends the name clung to him. - The comparison was perhaps a little profane. Yet is it riot true that we render worthiest honor to the sacred' dead, when we revere their real, fallible humanity, not the solemn ideals of our awe-stricken imagination? And the stoUa old Doctor, if the time had called him, would have met death for the faiths he humbly held, with as simple and serene a dignity as that which most sanctifies the annals of the heathen world. The meek representative of Xantippe had long been sleeping beneath the evergreens in the village graveyard; and there queened it over the Doctor's hospitable household his only daughter, a bright brunette of twenty,   12  .ASPENDALE. whose quaint but singularly appropriate name of Ruby need not be disguised. The light-minded student afore-mentioned returned with significant frequency to the scene of his boyish studies; and, since he was a graceless but captivating mortal, he, too, had earned a Greek nickname, - Alcibiades v The social resources of the ladies of Aspen-  dale comprised, further, one metaphysician, an old teacher of Zoe's, now dreamily instruct- ing in by-gone philosophies sundry classes in a neighboring college, while he elaborated his own system at the rate of a proposition a year; and, as a matter of course, the parish clergy- man. The latter deserves a word. He was young, amiable, accomplished, but eccentric. He considered his sphere of action commensurate with his abilities. He deemed that the pos- session of a small independent fortune ren- dered him peculiarly eligible to a poor and primitive settlement; and when invited, as he often was, to the cure of more sophisticated   ASPENDALE.       13 souls, he refused, on the ground that his rural people loved and leaned on him. He never could be made to appreciate his own self-sac- rifice, and even the refined petting of our heroines failed'to spoil him. Christine, in her' graceful way, treated him with almost a mother's tenderness, and gave him, beside, theoretic sympathy and practicalssistance. Zoe, who by turns extolled his devotion: and abused his creed, supplied what was equally valuable to the isolated worker, - the stimulus of frequent contact with an active, antagonistic mind. They used sometimes to call the minister Ignatius ("for is he not," asked Zoe, grandly, " one of the most authentic saints of Protestantism?") and the professor Aristocles. Our ladies begah their housekeeping late in a warm October, when the valley and the hillsides were still gay with their autumnal coloring. They arranged their old-fashioned rooms with doors and windows thrown wide open, admitting the faint chorus of the fall-   "      ASPENDALE. crickets, the orange sunshine, the: drifting. leaves. They furnished chiefly with the relics of vanished homes. The low walls were hung with pictures which had smiled on merry parlor-scenes far away. Here were the books which had supplied relief and repose to other harassed workers. There was the deep arm- chair where a dying head had rested. In the recess beside the fireplace, wreathed by a carefully transported ivy, stood the cabinet- desk which had held life-long secrets until they were secrets no longer. Quaint, lawless rooms they were; but they had an air of rich human association, which impressed the dullest ob- server. Sad thoughts must needs arise dur- ing those busy autumn days; but one of our friends at least had come where all memory was rounding into promise, and on the whole they worked cheerfully, and even gayly. "Do you remember," asked Christine, as she lingered for a moment over the well-worn copy of Childe Harold, which of course had been the text-book of her teens,- c do you   ASPENDALE.         15 remember the description of Petrarch's home at Arqua?" "Not at all." "Then let me read it to you.  I once sup- posed it to be the finest of all poetry, and now I seem to have realized it."   And Christine found and read,-- " And the loft, quiet hamlet where he dwelt Is one of that complexion which seems made For those who their mortality have felt, And found a refuge for their hopes decayed, )   In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade, v- Which shows a distant prospect far away, Of btisy cities now in vain displayed; For they can lure no longer, and the ray Of a bright sun can make sufficient holiday." Zoe nodded. "Yes," she said, "I think we will appropriate that. The conception of one's self looking down on the great Babel is such a dignified one. The stanza is a little tauto- logical, and a ' distant prospect of busy cities' is rather grandiose for the steeples of our shire town; but such is poetry!" "The last lines are the best," observed Chris- tine. "Only it remains to be shown whether. e                '    16       ASPENDALE. sunshine will be holiday enough for you. I proved it long ago." "Well, we shall see! Meanwhile, come help me drape the windows with this rather faded chintz, which certainly looks as if the allurements of busy cities ' had been displayed in vain for us." The finishing touches were added to their work at last, and that very afternoon the golden weather departed. All day the shadow of the elm-tree had been growing fainter on the lawn, and the blue mist of the morning, deepening. Fin-ally, the gathered vapors quenched the sun; and a south wind rose, and came mourning up the valley. 'Weary and more forlorn at heart than either chose to con- fess, the friends sat down in the big east room, and partook of their first tea at the hands of their single domestic, a small, weird old woman, who had served in thaqt farm-house for forty years, and tended Christine in her babyhood. "This will never do!" cried Zoe, springing    ASPENDALE.      17 up, after they had Sat for many minutes over their empty cups, their silence broken only by the mphatic ticking of the hall-clock on the stairsl' d the slow tread of old Sally about the long kitchen adjoining. "We want some firelight! We must sacrifice on the hearth in the west parlor.! Sally come with me."  What upon airth'-  uttered the old woman, but promptly obeyed, as people were apt to do, Zoe's imperious but not unkindly summons. The latter, who had arrayed her- self in a twinkling in water-proof cloak and hood, now seized a huge basket from the kitchen fireside, and left the house followed by her bewildered attendant. In ten minutes they returned, their basket heaped with dry pine cones, which were presently blazing upon the west room hearth. They made a wonder- ful illumination. -Each separate cone was like a blossom of fire, maturing sparks instead of seeds when its petals of flame had fallen, and diffusing. a faint, aromatic perfume throughout the transfigured parlor. Zoe sat 2   18     * ASPENDALE. on the old Persian hearth-rug, and leaned her arms upon the fender. Christine rested in -an easy-chair opposite, undeniably pale and pensive. ( It is the south wind that ails you," began Zoe; for that importunate voice still wailed without, as though it would compel the atten- tion of all fireside dreamers to some tragic circumstances overlooked by them. "You share the common superstition about a south wind presaging calamity." "I superstitious? '" "Assuredly. It is I who am a materialist, -a child of the century. But I am certain you told me once, that during the war a south wind invariably preceded a Federal defeat." '"It was a friend of mine who noted that remarkable fact; and I believe she kept a journal, which she produces to this day, there- by confounding sceptics. Yet, now I think of it, I myself have seen the south wind at once the precursor and the most fatal element of a stupendous calamity, - the great Portland   ASPENDALE.       19 fire of '66. And once again, - at Brookhouse: have you forgotten, Zoe? '" Then came another pause.   "Yes," ad- mitted Christine at length, in reply to the accusation which she read in Zoe's eyes, 4 I own it. I am sentimental." *"Perhaps a few verses would relieve you." "Impertinence!  How  did you know  I had been guilty of an original hymn on this interesting occasion?" "Because I know your constitution, and because it is an occasion, and finally because I have been versifying a bit myself." Both ladies now laughed. heartily. "Let us relieve our minds at once," cried Zoe; "and I foresee that we shall sleep deliciously. Begin, please. You are the elder." "A fact you will never allow me to forget, which brings me naturally to my subject;" and Christine read from'a bit of crumpled paper:-- "Let me forget! I The sunshind plays In changeful beauty on the forest flor; I think of light that lit the olden days, And this is bright no more.   20         ASPENDALE. Let me forget! The autumnal hues Are gayer on the mountains than of yore; I think of roses wet with summer dews, And mind this pomp no more. Let me forget! The crickets twang Low in the meadow as the dark draws nigh; But I would hear the whip-poor-will that sang My childish lullaby. Let me forget! Abroad I rove, Aid welcome waits me at each open door; Yet still I weep for the remembered love That is on earth no more. Let me forget I Within mine'ear A tender tale is whispered, soft and low. How is it that my heart can only hear A voice hushed long ago . " "And mine," said Zoe, " is in    the same pious strain,' as your old minister used to say, when his voice failed him   at the second verse of a hymn. I called it ' The Survivors.'" "In this sad hour, so still, so late, When flowers are dead and birds are flown, Close sheltered from the blasts of Fate, Our little love burns brightly on; Amid the wrecks of dear desire That ride the waves of life no more, As stranded voyagers light their fire Upon a lonely island shore.   ASPENDALE.         21 And though we deem that soft and fair, Beyond the tempest and the sea, Our hearts' true homes are smiling where In life we never more shall be; Yet we are saved, and we may rest; / And, hearing each the other's voice, We cannot hold ourselves unblest, Although we may not quite- rejoice. We'll warm our hearts, and softly sing Thanks for the shore whereon we're driven; Storm-tossed no more, we'll fold the wing, And dream forgotten dreams of heaven." The solid  footstep  of Sally in the little hall had been unheard during Zoe's reading; and the latter was now startled by an unex- pected criticism from the door-way: "Them's dreadful woe-begone verses for a spry young woman to write.     Won't you  have some wood? "Thanks, Sally, both for the opinion and the offer. But we won't vulgarize our fire, will we?   No: let us rake up our cone ashes after this, and retire to' the sweet rest of the laboring woman."                   \ '   *    22      ASPENDALE. IIL ^THHE south wind proved the portent f no worse calamity than a severe autumnal gale, which stripped the forests of their last frail finery, and left an almost wintry world behind when it retired. Wintry, but not un- beautiful. - The serious charm of the leafless New England landscape, the tender harmo- nies of color brought out by the slant No- vember sunshine, brown fields and woods lighted with gold and shaded with purple,- these things had long been precious to Chris- tine; while to Zoe, in her unwontedly peaceful and receptive mood, they appealed with all the charm of novelty. , Why," demanded the latter somewhat grandiloquently,--" why do not our native' artists oftener paint and sing this grave, 9eet aspect of northern nature? They seem   ASPENDALE.      23 to have eyes only for the green of June, or the flame color of October; but this sunny, brown world, with its serene blue sky and ruddy sunsets, appeals to my heart. There is a sentiment, one might almost say a: pabtlos, about it which I cannot exactly interpret, but which moves me very much." I can explain it," said Christine. They had been treading with rustling steps a cart-path in the forest, stopping occasionally to appropriate some trailing vine or delicate fern for the adornment of their winter-parlor. Coming now to the edge of the wood, they leaned upon the bars that closed the path- way, and surveyed the broad and simple landscape. "When you call a scene like this pathetic, I know what you mean; and you are right. And the reason is that the life lived here is pathetic, the -old-fashioned New England life, - and the landscape at this season is entirely in harmony with the life. Why, look at this view! There is nothing to mar its el   24       ASPENDALE. ' sober unity. The old, brown farm-houses upon the hill-sides look, for all the world, like growths of the soil. Now and then there is a tinge of brighter color, -in the sunny 6hip yards; inside the open barn-doors, where you see the hay-mows, and the pumpkins heaped upon the floor; in the orchards where the red, cattle are .nibbling the dry grass: but even these are sober tints, and repeated in the per- sistent foliage of the oak-groves. This sky, as you say, is marvellously blue, but a little cold in its clearness. The coloring of the scene is all so grave that even the sun-rays are half absorbed, and there is no dazzle any- where. 4'A   I, who know the people-who live on these farms, and how they live, can tell you that it is eminently so with their lives. Grace, gayety, sparkle, are not for them; but purity is, and, amid hard toil, a kind of homely dignity and repose. I perceive a yet more solemn analogy. The solitary moun- tain which lords it over all the land is strangely like the stern creed whereby the            ASPENDALE.       25 folk in this region have been wont to climb to heaven. How toilsome and even discour-, aging the pathway is, how constantly hemmed Q. in and   shaded, affording how few  airy glimpses, none can tell save those who have tried it. But it leads to heights whence earth looks infinitely little; and viewed from the distance of an utterly altered life, alike in this world and the next I fancy, that scene of sad endeavor looks soft and radiant as an evening cloud. Excuse my eloquence." N J "Don't mention it! Iam only glad you will own that the pathway is a hard one! In your militant moods you never confess so much. Of course these people go to heaven, if they go anywhere. It' is their life here I would like to understand, -- to understand as you do, to live that I may understand it. For, in the first place, the type is evidently ' passing away.  We can see three deserted farms from this very spot; and life in the country villages hereabout is- oh what a cheerless and graceless transition from gen- a.     o   26    .   ASPENDALE.  uine simplicity to- Heaven knows what! ,And then, as this homely, rural type vanishes, I begin to perceive, and others do also I r  , observe, that it is going to be of significance in history. For it is, or was, distinctively Amer- ican, do you see, - the natural fruit of Puri- tan republicanism, -the only distinct social variety which our country has yet produced." "If you except the picturesque old planta- tion life in the South before the war."  Yes, that life was picturesque. I suppose all truly national ife is so. And it appeared altogether fair and regular, yet was, perhaps, an excrescence, a product of disease, -like an oak-gall, do you understand? I suppose all truly national life is rural too. Rich people in great cities live very much alike the world over. London is in some things wonderfully like Boston; and Paris, it appears, lile New York. But nobody can accuse the natives here of having ' merged,' as Mr. Tennyson says, 'in form and gloss the picturesque of man and man.' So I am going to study social history in Aspendale. 'Why do you smile?"       i *                 .$n   ASPENDALE.       27 "I am thinking what a lofty aim yours is, and what woful obstacles you will encounter in its pursuit. Did it never occur to you that the ' natives,' of whom being one I speak feel- ingly, might object to being studied?" "How can they help themselves?" "You will see. There is a wonderful reti- cence, a kind of grim, obstinate pride, about these townspeople of mine. They feel it an outrage when their 'ways' are scrutinized. Sometimes I think they have a dim   con- sciousness that their neglect of the graces is the least defensible feature of their manners, add so they are especially sensitive on that point." "But I am net going to preach the graces here." "All the better for you. In that case I shall not hesitate to take you with me to see my friend, Mrs. Baker, down here in the val- ley.  Eggs are the object of my call. Sally says it wouldn't be Christian to have a Thanksgiving without pies; and pies imply '   28       ASPENDALE. eggs. So, while I am bargaining, you can study a New England interior, if you will do it modestly." "No, thank you! I have already made Mrs. Baker's acquaintance. I passed her house on one of those warm days last week, and stopped there for a drink of water. A little boy-was tweaking a kitten's ears inside the door; and, by way of making myself delightful, I asked him what his kitty's name was. His mother answered for him,-- ' We've got something else to do here besides naming cats! '" Christine laughed. "' Her manners have not that repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere;' but neither are yours perfect. Your intention of making yourself delightful was too apparent. She won't snub me, you will see." "No, I shall not see. I shall remain out- side, while you go in; regard this lovely brown landscape, and collect my thoughts." "More likely scatter them!. Au revoir!"   ASPENDALE.       29 When Christine rejoined her companion, -the latter was apparently ready with the result of her meditations. "Is have been thinking," she began,-- "but, first, what sort of an escape had you from your friend? You got -your eggs, I see." "Yes; and don't let me forget that this ls my friend's basket. Now for your reflec- tions." "I have' only been reviewing the work of my illustrious predecessors on the field where you say I am to be defeated. It abashes me somewhat to remember that many of our very best writers have made it their most serious business to portray and interpret New England life and customs. Tell me, now, how far you think they have succeeded. Let us begin with Hawthorne." "It is altogether agreeable to me to begin there; but let me tell you, that you, to be consistent, should begin somewhere else. You claim to be a young positivist, ad - be- lieve in collecting your facts first, and build- ,   30       ASPENDALE. ing up your theory afterwards, if ever. Now Hawthorne framed his theory to begin with, and a very weird and sombre one it was; and colored his facts deeply too, sometimes, to suit the same. In the I Scarlet Letter' I think he distorted them."  "I do not, then! Hawthorne was an artist, not a mere photographer; and, as an artist, he had the right to paint his landscape under what light he chose. If he could manage a gloomy, sanguinary sunrset, all the better for the effect of the picture!" "Possibly, for its effect as a picture, but not Jor a preserve of national customs,-- a transcript of real life, a contribution to history."         I t "But why should not history admit the ideal, - enough of it at least to give unity to the separate features, as all good portrait- painters do? Now I think that in Haw- thorne's case -the details are studied with consummate care. The scene of the ' Scarlet Letter,' which you don't like, because it is *  '          *   ASPENDALE.       31 not orthodox, and condemns orthodoxy, is laid in a bygone time; but in the 'House of the Seven Gables,' and noticeably in the 4 Blithe- dale Romance,' which are stories of to-day, there is a singular realism. In the wonderful ' Note Book,' too, you see conclusive evidence, if any were needed, of the most patient and minute observation of facts. Look at those earlier chapters, where the author describes his rambles in the neighborhood of Salem. ! You are not familiar with that Essex County landscape? It is not very unlike this, if you substitute for the rest.:of the hills the sadness of the sea., It is like this, but more cul- tured, bearing evidence of having been what it is for a longer time. There are more marks of material wealth, a stronger human flavor; but it is a rural landscape still. And this simple, sober scenery he paints with absolute and amazing fidelity. L know noth- ing like it. It is stereoscopic.!-You do not imagine the rather insignificant scene. ' You are there!"   32       ASPENDALE. "But there, are you not, with a constant sense of the writer's presence? His render- ing of the scene is, after all, subjective. His brooding figure walks beside yonu, overpow- ering your individuality, and informing the landscape- which, by the way, as the scene of a great historic tragedy can never be really insignificant - with his own." "What else should a master mind do? All I say is, that he never misrepresented facts!" "And if not, perhaps the erring moral that he drew from them was all the more specious. You say that my orthodoxy is offended by the ' Scarlet Letter,' but it seems to me that faith itself, under whatever form, must recoil pom it. For that terrible story, with all the power and pathos that are in it, preaches a subtle fatalism which bars the old way to heaven, and removes the very bases of morality." "It only removes the rubbish of years, and shows that those bases were not exactly   ASPENDALE.      33 where we thought them,'and closes an old circuitous road perhaps to open a more direct one. For the rest, how can a work be im- moral which gives one such a-realization of the horror of sinll? In this respect there is nothing like it out of Shakespeare. And the fatalistic moral of which you speak, -no, it is not a contradiction of terms,- the doubt thrown upon moral responsibility is precisely the same as in Hamlet. Only Shakespeare is accounted orthodox, so there you do not demur." "Nay, if you become personal as well as polemical, Ishall mark Hawthorne a 'private way not safe for travel,' and pass on, - say to Mrs. Stowe." "That would look well in you! To atone for the suggestion, oblige me by a little abuse." "I have only one more criticism to make, and that a mild one. I think you misused the word 'stereoscopic.' What makes the stereoscopic picture so lifelike is that it com- 3 \   34       ASPENDALE. bines and fuses the impressions received from different points of view. You see the anal- ogy. No one-sided portraiture, however closely and patiently studied, can be stereo- scopic. And" the stereoscope, like many of the results of physical science, old and new, interests people largely, although they may not know it, through its moral significance, -its correspondence, as the Swedenborgians say." "A sentimental delusion! So then the moral world is only the shadow of the'mate- rial projected upon the unknown." Mo: the material is the shadow of the 'moral projected upon our consciousness." "Really, we are very profound! -Well, and Mrs. Stowe." "Now \re emerge into daylight! To me, then, Mrs. Stowe has done more of the patri- otic work in question, and done it more faith- fully and lovingly, than any other American writer. I think she will be remembered for this longer even than for Uncle Tom's Cabin,'   ASPENDALE.       35 which was a success of rare opportunity,- a harbinger, --a tocsin. When she treats of New England life, the spirit of a grand Puritan ancestry seems to enter into her. She is always inspired, always happy." "You don't mean her exhaustive discus- sions of crinoline and parlor furniture." "No. Yet even those had an excellent aim, and will do good where they are needed. Even now, I fear her readers cannot all dis- tinguish between costliness and elegance; and how many ofthem, think you, would like the taste of a new idea upon the most trivial sub- ject'Xunless it were plentifully watered and sugared? Besides, I don't know that even you, with your scorn of money and the fanat- ical admiration for conciseness, which you learned of Aristocles, could be trusted to fur- nish a series of articles at so much a page to. a popular monthly magazine. Think of the number of English edition's to which they would be equivalent! The temptation to reiterate must be very severe. But in a * *            X   36       ASPENDALE. serious study of the characteristic country life of which we are talking, Mrs, Stowe very nearly satisfies me. She is grave, yet humo- rous. She is pious, she is simple, she is tender." "Simple?" "Almost. The sum of what she has thought in this matter is in ' Oldtown Folks;' and ' Oldtown Folks' is a delightful book. The plot may be poor, and the action may loiter, but brains are quickened and hearts softened by the story; and these, I conceive, are among the best uses of any book. My copy has been the rounds of the parish, or of its readers, and these are no small proportion of the pop- ulation, - for, as papa used to say,' one must read or die here,'-and I think the author would have been deeply gratified by its recep- tion. Unaffected delight, abundant verifica- tion, and now and then a dash of very shrewd criticism. Everybody, it seemed, had known a Sam Lawson, an Aunt Lois, a Mrs. Badger; some few, Master Holyoke "   - v     ASPENDALE.       37 "The finest sketch in all the book," mur- mured Zoe     . "Miss Asphyxia and Miss Mehitable. To have made old days live again in hearts which had almost forgotten the sacred yearning after youth ought to be one of the sweetest rewards of authorship, - equal to the aforesaid Eng- lish editions." "Well, perhaps so. You should know. But now may I propound a little heresy?" "In confidence to me you may-; but ' faith' you'll not print it' till you are older." "I don't want to print it; I only want to  free my mind, as thus: I, too, relish Mrs. Stowe's portraiture, and admire her power, \ just so long as she confines herself to common \  people and humble life. 'Her Sam Lawsons \ are perfect; her kitchen firesides ravishing, \ because there her pencil is entirely free. IBut when she comes to deal with finer folk, and more cultured ways, as of course she must, in order to get the necessary variety of color in her stories, her manner changes. Now she   38       ASPENDALE. writes nicely, assiduously, consciously. She touches the same spot more than once,-- many times, in fact; and that I suppose to be as great a sin in literature ,as my old master in pencil drawing used to say it was in that modest branch of art. Madame de Fron-tig- nac and Aaron Burr spoiled the ' Minister's Wooing,' and Ellery Davenport is a blemish on 'Oldtown Folks.' In short, our author writes of 'high life' with an unction which offends my taste. There! I have said"-- "Not .much to the purpose, dear! No doubt the sin of which you speak doth easily beset us all; but you have surely overshot the truth. Mrs. Stowe groups high and low (I use the terms for convenience' sake, not wish- ing to offend that sensitive democracy of feeling which, by the way, is a sudden devel- opment in you) according to her own notions of form and color, which are not yours, - that is all. Consider how far from the scope and tone of ' Uncle Tom's Cabin' is the literary weakness of which you speak! Besides, how   ASPENDALE.      39 should it exist in one who has surely lived among fine people rather than coarse?" "Nay, I know not how it can be: I only know it is; although there is less of it, in ' Un- cle Tom's Cabin,' where the author is carried out of herself by a mighty purpose, tian any- where else. And it lessens -her dignity as a writer. Do you remember what Scott says of ' Monk' Lewis? After that tender and whimsical lament, so like Scott, -?How few friends we have whose faults are simply ridiculous!' -he adds that Lewis was much fonder of great places and great people than he'should have been, either as a man of talent or as a man of fashion. ' The names of dukes and duchesses were so constantly upon his lips that you would have sworn he was a parvenu, and yet he had lived all his life in -the best society.'" "I remember :that, and a yet more comical anecdote about Lewis, apropos of those same dukes and duchesses. The author of the ' Monk' was once staying in the same house   40       ASPENDALE. with the Duke and Duchess of York, and one day he had some pers6nal conversation with'the latter. When he left her side, he was observed to have tears in his eyes, and a friend asked him very anxiously what had happened.  Oh,' replied Lewis, ' the Duchess spoke so kindly to me.' Never mind, my, dear fellow,' said a bystander, 'I dare say she didn't mean it.'" "The moral is, that the best society is not enough. Moreover, when you speak of differ- ences of opinion about grouping and the like, I cannot follow you. The laws of form and color are as absolute as the laws of music, are they not?  Also, Mrs. Stowe does not write as an artist, but as a moralist always. In some of Whittiez's ballads we have Newt England life treated artistically; and how remote from the gentle greatness of the poet is the taint of which we speak! The coun- tess and the maiden, the judge and that poor, dear boy who ' fed her father's kine,' -- or was it'swine?- all stand in the same sweet light,   ASPENDALE.      41 and have the same artless manners. It is always so with the greatest writers. Shake- speare, -Scott himself, Goethe, Mrs. Lewes, treat small and great with divine indifference. It is not quite the same with Thackeray. He seems to take unnecessary pains to belittle the socially great, while with Dickens the balance leans undisguisedly to the side of the 'unwashed;' and thus, although so amiable, his not one of the?atest, neither. Lastly, as to the people whrn our author has known. I am sure there must be many among them whom I would give my so-called ' golden' hair -. and what more can I say? - merely to have seen; yet one she has not known, - our Igna- tius. When I hear 4 blood and culture' talk, I always think of him. We know, and he knows, and I dare -say he humbly mentions it in his- thanksgiving every night, that his ancestry is singularly disting ished. Colo- nial governors and Revolutionary brigadiers are there, and college professors gjnd famed divines have been as the dust of the earth.   42       ASPENDALE. But now perIectly are the consequences of descent absorbed in our little priest! It is quite true, as you say, that my manners are faulty; but what of his? To me thev are a perpetual study. He never adjusts them, they adjust themselves. Among the plain, prim people hereabout, who more plain and prim than he? He lives in sacred ignorance of the word ' condescension.' Compassionate him for his privations, he bows and looks puzzled. Hint that his natural sphere is a different one, he laughs a laugh of mystification, or says, perhaps, that he supposes his sphere is where his work is. I never heard of another like him  unless it were the apostle Paul. Paul, who became 'all things to all men;' and the expression implies that he did it nat- urally, not with a ponderous effort, - Paul, who,.when he talked to the Areopagites in polished Athens, could be so infinitely polite. 'O selfless man and stainless gentleman,' if you were only a little less of a b " There was a peal of girlish laughter and a   ^!     ASPENDALE.      43 sound of brisk footsteps behind them. Turn- ing in amazement, our ladies beheld the young divine of whom they spake, and Ruby, the Doctor's daughter, gay with Scotch-plaid wrappings, and the wing of a scarlet tana- ger in her jaunty hat. Zoe never flinched in a sudden emergency. i "Whence came ye?" she demanded. "For my part," replied Ruby, demurely, "I was going about doing deeds of mercy,-- carrying one of my Thanksgiving pies to Aunt Bethiah, that means, when the minister met me like the curate in a Church-of-Eng- land novel. I accepted his escort home, and,f at the turn, we caught sight of you two, whom we hurried to overtake. I heard your last apostrophe, Miss Zoe, and think you are bound to tell us of whom you were talk- ing." "No matter," said the minister, blushing slightly. "Miss Zoe must have had an in- spiring theme, or she would not look so ani- mated."   "      ASPENDALE.  "Our theme was large as usual," replied Christine, smiling. "We had' been talking about American authors, and who of them had rendered New England country life most truthfully." "Ard we should be glad to hear from our brother and sister," added Zoe. The young man deferred to his companion. "I did not expect to be called upon," re- marked Ruby, quaintly; "but will say that my studies in this direction have been narrow, but deep. The only book which I remember as giving a very vivid picture of New Eng- land country life is the 'Wide, Wide World,' and that I have read nine times, and the scene of it is laid in New York." "Nevertheless," observed Christine, amid the  general laughter, " the 'Wide Wide World' was a good book, and an indepen- dent one; and is almost in point. The rural life of New England shades off imperceptibly into that of the Middle States, whereof we have a vivid picture in Mrs. Relbecca Davis' 4   ASPENDALE.      45 desolate stories, and a lifelike one in the 'Story of Kenneth,' - so much the best because the least labored of Bayard Taylor's noyels." "I have three books in mind," said Ig- natius. '"iHenry Ward Beecher's ' Norwood,' - or rather what that book might have -been and meant to be, for, strangely enough, you never lose sight of the author's ideal while, struggling through the morass of his failure; an unpretending little story called the ' Flower of the Family;' and another, older yet, and never farrous, but I am reminded of it often, 'Hoaryhead,' by Jacob Abbot. Hoaryhead was the name of a mountain, and the action of the various stories which make up the volume all went on under its shadow. The mountain was evidently a real one, although not ours, I shoed say. Now this book, as I remember it, gave a very sober and accurate picture of the primitive -Puritan life. All the , details were hard and homely; but there was the veritable scenery, both physical and spirit- '-N '      "      ASPENDALE. ual,-the intense religious conviction, the tremendous sense of moral responsibility underlying even the blasphemies of the rep- robates." "I remember it," cried Zoe; "more espe- cially one affecting story of a widowed mother and her boy. The mother was a typical New England woman, with a sensitive conscience and an over-active brain. She loved her boy passionately, nervously; and he was a well- meaning brute. I have cried more than once over that woman's conversion, on rainy, Sun- days long ago. Yes, it was no common book." The minister glanced at her with a kind of diffident curiosity. "I don't like to leave this matter here," he said,- -for now they had come to where the Aspendale road turned aside from the village highway,--" because it has a certain bearing on what is ju'st now weighing upon my mind,- the replenish- ment of our Sabbath-school Library. When may I come, ladies, and talk that over? Not   ASPENDALE.      47 before Thanksgiving, because my sermon is yet to write." "And I will not ask you to dine with us on the day when New England dines,' re- plied Christine,- "because somebody else would be disappointed if you came, and because we have decided, unwisely I dare say, to dinre with our memories that day. By early candle-light, however, we will bid our ghosts a fond farewell, and take you in. So will you come to tea?" "Thanks; and if our Professor should come over, as he sometimes does on a holiday "- ( He will come too, of course," said Zoe, promptly. "And we will discuss the sermon first, and the Sabbath-school books afterwards. I.' smell the battle afar off.' Good-by, Ruby. Good-by." And they parted. . , '.   "I. IN the gray light of the bitter Thanksgiving morning, Zoe, whose ("scheming brain" chanced to have been wide-awake for, hours, stole down into the long kitchen where Sally was preparing breakfast. Sally welcomed her with dubious cordiality. "Well, I'm glad it's you, and not her. Folks as have lived in this house, off and on,. e  for forty year or more, has a good deal to think on such a day as this; and 'taint best to begin too early in the morning.;' "Did they have famous Thanksgivings here in old times?" asked Zoe, as she luxu- riated in -the warmth of .the kitchen fire. "That they did," replied the old woman. "These are lean doin's," - waving her skinny arm toward' the store-room; "but in old Madam's time,- Miss' grandmother that   ASPENDALE.      49 brought her up,--Lor' sake! Old Madam was as proud as a sarpent; and, money or no money, she'd have great' goin's on at Thanksgiving time. The hull connection used to be here over-night, and a shiftless set they were, take 'em for all in all; but their ways was kinder pleasin'. I remember the year Madam was failin', how she stood up, though she was just ready to drop, and had things done the same as ever; and Miss cried about it out o' sight, -and her father too. A kinder man never breathed than Miss' father. After Madam died, you know, he went away; and they lived at that other place that he called Brookhouse, though there was no great of a brook there that ever I see. You been there?" Zoe assented and smiled, remembering Miss Trotwood and the Rookery. "But they always come back here to Thanksgiving, and genially brought company with 'em,-mostly men, and a fine sort. Some on 'em used to expect me to black  4 \    \   50       ASPENDALE. their boots. 'The land!' says I to Miss' father. 'What sort o' folks be they? Who made 'em? I'll do most any thing for you and Miss, but that I won't do.' So after that he used to do 'em himself. And then-- Lor', I could tell you a book full. You know Miss' brother that was such an everIastin' trial to 'em. You've seen him times enough. Had you forgotten that it was Thanksgiving week he died? 'sh!" - for Christine's step was heard upon the stairway. "Don't hear our little teacher, captiously to-day," pleaded Christine, as the friends set out for church beneath a sky which frowned steadily, but did not storm, like one whose wrath is indubitable though unspoken. "My blessed woman! Am I still a fro- ward child? Captious before that simple if, ineffectual earnestness, that modest if forlorn valor?" "No truer knight of harassed Truth ever bore armor. I almost wish we had -called him Galahad rather than Ignatius.   ASPENDALE.      51 "But Galahad was a seeker." "And is not he?" "Nay, how can one seek and teach too?" "One might perhaps teach in the practical order while he sought in the speculative," mused Zoe, as she listened to the straightfor- ward ministrations of her young friend. She could have smiled with satisfaction as, she followed his sober and explicit rendering of thanks. "4 He is so sincere and matter-of-fact with his Maker, that some of these good people consider him undevout, and whisper that he is not 'gifted in prayer; '" and Zoe was much amused at the remembrance. Warmly admiring the single-mindedness of the preacher, and the mild and reasonable character of his counsels, she felt moved to sudden dissent when he came, as in duty bound, to the urging of motives and the offering of inducements. "It is of no use," she sighed; " one cannot, after all, teach with authority unless he believes with assurance." I * I    52     .ASPENDALE. And having fancied that she espied a solution afar, she allowed its vanity. The seas over which she was voyaging are haunted by mirage; and blessed, or cursed, by frequent fleeting glimpses of inaccessible shored. Something of all this she communicated on the way home to Christine, who answered gently, that to-day, as always, she had liked both the spirit and substance of what her little priest had said. "I liked the practical part best," replied Zoe, somewhat shortly. And for once it was Christine who re- sponded doubtfully: "And I could almost say that I liked the practical part least. I mean in its relation to the majority of his audience. They hardly need it; they are moral enough. Their duties are small and simple; ,and they, for the most part, well minded to perform  them.  What they do need is to have their brains stimulated and their imaginations warmed. And why should not this be effected, as in old times, by the   A SPENDALE.      53 presentation of puzzling doctrine, and by poetic descriptions of an unearthly future awaiting all? I really, wish our young thoroughbred would sometimes allow him- self and us a little rhethric. Agnd one day I may tell him -so. When a deacon informs me in- confidence that he wants rather more 'doctrinal' preaching, and' an ' eccentric deaconess deprecates too many sermons from St. James, on the ground that the latter was 'an old Unitarian,' I think they are feeling this' very lack; and who shall say they are wrong?  "I will pronounce no one wrong," replied the younger,." until I am sure that some one is right." The day was already declining when the friends sat down to their quiet repast, and the sky seemed ever to darken. Arrayed in her grotesque and antiquated best, Sally waited at table. Her solemnity was por- 'tentous; and she gave more than one mys-,   54  .    ASPENDALE. terious head-shake behind Christine's chair, as though rebuking the too forward spirits of the hour. "Do not have her in again," cried Zoe, as the door closed behind their attendant. "She is too uncanny." But Christine answered very sadly, "Poor Sally! She knows that this is a service rather than a feast." "Shade of Auguste Comte!". cried Zpe, somewhat thoughtessly, in her impatience to break the spell thit bound them. "Here is an Orthodox church-member, in 'good and regular standing,' who would transforin the old Puritan Thanksgiving into a Festival of Humanity!" And at length Christine smiled. "Trim the fires!" continued Zoe, as they rose from table; and proceeded deftly to exe- cute her .own commands, so that generous flames were soon roaring upward from the( hearth in either room. And suddenly, as if melting at the appeal, the western sun shone   ASPENDALE.       55 out beneath the -masses of funereal cloud, the distant spires flashed into light, hillside and forest received an intense ruddy illumination, and the ivied parlor glowed like a carbuncle. Then Zoe opened the piano, and played a subtile strain from Mendelssohn; not sad, not glad, but sweet and strong, foretelling the fusion of mortal joy and sorrow in a mystic mood seldom  attainable in mortal sphere. And as she struck the last clear chord, two shadows crossed the sunshine, and from the light without into the light within the ladies drew and welcomed their expected guests. Two very dissimilar figures they were,-- types of the new generation of students and the old. The minister was small, keen-eyed, compact, athletic, glowing with the results of solemn, physical culture; the professor, tall, stooping, attenuated, with dreamy, short- sighted eyes, and mild, pale visage. Sinking into the biggest arm-chair, with an uncon- scious sense of fitness; the latter peered benignly about our ladies' bower.- * L'    56       ASPENDALE. "Really, really!" he began, rubbinb his frail hands softly before the fire: " this is very pleasant, I like the--the AOos of the place" (with a deprecatory wave of the fin- gers). "You have expressed yourselves here, my dear friends; and the result is necessarily beautiful. Luxuries," he continued, settling his head with an air of absolute content, " are graceful only in so far as they are necessi- ties." It was never too early in an interview for Aristocles to relapse into the abstract, provided he was comfortable. His friends always took it as a sign that they had made him entirely at home. "That is to say,' he continued, " if I am so constituted or so cultivated that I cannot employ a coarse implement, or regard an unlovely object with complacency, and could not were I the only man living, then the fine implement and the artistic surroundings become me; not otherwise." The Professor paused, and closed his eyes.   ASPENDALE.      57 '"So that is the theory of it," observed Ignatius, glancing brightly around him. And Zoe, who had a naughty propensity for teasing and testing 'his Reverence, re- plied, -    . "So it seems. Now suppose you apply it to some of the village homes." "That does not seem to me the place to apply it,'? was the simple answer. Having arranged his form of expression during this aside, the deliberate Professor went on,- "I have observed that he who affects ele- gance merely because another is elegant is apt to be vulgar. 'And hence much of the luxury of our great cities, though splendid in itself, is coarse and obtrusive in effect, because it does not indicate a correspondent human culture. Now with the superlative luxury of the ancient world it seems to have been other- wise. Consider that of Rome in her decadence. That, if we may judge by its'remains, was all spontaneous, the necessary outgrowth of   58       ASPENIALE. senses refined to an unwholesome degree. Plenty of vice is implied therein, but little of what we call vulgarity." "Ah!" cried Zoe, " that is perhaps because the splendor has outlived those who, revelled in it. Are you sure there were no snobs in imperial Rome? So am not I." "Nay," replied the Professor, indulgently, -he was always indulgent to Zoe, -- I only say that no material traces remain of any such." "And then, dear sir," urged Christine, " we are not isolated souls. We learn of one another. My aesthetic perceptions are sharp- ened by the beauty with which my friend surrounds himself, and my ideal is raised. And when I beautify myself, I must- must I not?--consider chiefly the pleasure I shall give my friend." "Not chiefly," insisted the Professor; " not directly. But there we touch upon a great subject. I have devoted one entire section of my Philosophy of the Mind to the law of -   \   ASPENDALE.      59 indirect effort, or the will as a disturbing agent in certain intellectual operations. I shall there develop my views fully upon this point; but now "- But now the- tea-bell rang. Ignatius awaited manfully the promised criticisms on his Thanksgiving sermon, but received instead only a little unqualified approval from his two elder friends. Zoe privately thought the Professor's praise some- what exaggerated, but reflected, with the wisdom she was learning' of Christine, that it might be only natural for a modest philoso- pher to overrate a performance so entirely beside his own speculative line. And then the minister begged to be forgiven if he pressed the dull subject of the Sabbath- school 'Library. "For indeed," he added energetically," 'tis too many for me." "( Ah, how is that?" demanded the philoso- pher as one who awaketh from a dream. "Well, sir, I told you something about it   60       ASPENDALE. on the way hither; but I don't think I made you comprehend the situation. The fact is that many of my people get their entire read- ing from the library connected with our Sabbath school. It is their only channel of communication with general literature. And under these circumstances I have thought it would be well to select additions to the library, with a view not merely of confirming those who read in certain doctrines which they and I believe to be true, but also of freshening th6ir minds generally, stirring them up, familiarizing them with the thought and work of the age, and making them think a little for themselves; in short, turn- ing their ideas for the time being entirely away from their crops and their"'- "Souls!" exclaimed Zoe. "Hear! hear!" The Professor smiled on her as he did not smile on a disorderly class, and nodded to his young friend to go on. "You do not condemn the notion," the latter continued. "To me, it seemed so   ASPENDALE.       61 obviously the right one, that I took it for granted something of the kind must have been done already, and supposed I had only to push a little farther in the same direction. So I proceeded first to examine the books we have on hand; for of course we don't want duplicates, and cannot afford them. And then I got my first blow. The collection as it stands, --I speak among friends of course," with a furtive glance at Zoe, who gave' him a gesture of encourage- ment and a most winning smile,- ' the col- lection as it stands amazed me by its inanity. The books may be divided into three classes. The first, because by far the largest and most read, consisted of little tales, fictitious narra- tives of boys and girls who tried or did not try to serve God in their generation, and were blessed or unblessed accordingly,--How Robbie became a Preacher, or Jennie and her Tin Savings Bank; and also a more mature species describing the tritals and temptations of young worthies at school, pretty unnatural   62       ASPENDALE. kind of prigs too, if my memory of the real character serves me. I don't mean that there is any harm in these books severally. No doubt they are capable of affording a trivial sort of pleasure to an infant with whom books are rare; but there was a prevailing weakness about them. I don't remember one which seemed to me likely to make a serious impression on a child of real depth of nature or activity of mind; their literary execution reminds one of the painted wood-cuts in a cloth picture-book, and their number renders them an abuse. Six of them might nct be amiss; but what think you of sixty-seven in a library of about a hundred volumes? Sixty- seven goody little story-books, chiefly distin- guishable by the color of their covers!" "It sounds like Carlyle! Pray go on." "I will, because I really want light. The second class comprised one or two books of Eastern travel, of whose value I cannot judge, but which are probably instructive; and some twenty memoirs of excellent   ASPENDALE.      63 adults. Don't laugh, Miss Zoe. They are- all dead now, I do assure you, and made very edifying ends; and indeed I don't want to be misunderstood in this matter. Some of these lives were sickly and insignificant enough; but of others, - those of obscure sufferers or missionary martyrs,--the story seemed to me very well worth telling. If it could only have been told in an easier, more straightforward, more forcible way! Why," continued the speaker, with an air of perplexed simplicity, "were there so many pages from morbid diaries? and why do people keep diaries, who have no notion of recording their actual experiences, and make bad work of appropriating and adapting those of old-time saints?9" ' "Why, indeed?" said Christine. "A diary is certainly a kind of morbid secretion; but, if spontaneous and unstudied, it is very apt to prove a pearl. Look at the journals of the De Gudrin! Healthful they are not; but how beautiful, how affecting! Those two, of   "       ASPENDALE. course, were rarely delicate and distinguished spirits; but the humblest human soul that ever hoped for heaven has, I think, a story worth telling, could it only be told with the artless sincerity of that dear brother and sister." "Exactly! You are always right. It is the true story of the soul we want, and in some sort --is it not;--the true story of the body.' I mean we ought to have the whole man or the whole woman,--their looks, their ways, their oddities, their weaknesses, their failures, no less than their struggles and aspirations and ecstasies, - if any. God's creatures, as they are, seem to me quite good enough for biographical purposes, but with sanctimonious masks I cannot away ' " - "Now, Ignatius," said Zoe, with an air of the most engaging fairness, "I think you are too sweeping. I arn quite sure that efforts are sometimes made after the realism which you admire. I remember one Sunday noon, while waiting for Christine, I amused   ASPENDALEM       65  myself, if that is the proper word, with one of these very biographies. It was that of a young girl who died early, in decline; and, among the evidences of grace which she gave  in her last days, it was mentioned, in italics, that she asked her mother for green tea. If that is not ,pre-Raphaelitism in pious biography, what is it?" "Poor girl!" observed Christine. "Her nerves had been plied with that sort of stim- ulus until she could not live or even die without it; and probably she had too much nerve to begin with. So -the green tea was significant, after all." Ignatius sighed. Aristocles smiled,- "'And your third class of books," said he. Certainly, sir. My third class consisted of five volumes, all of lasting, and some of everlasting, value; but queerly assorted, as it seemed to me, and every one in a state of remarkable preservation. They were the ' Pil- grim's Progress,' the ' Imitation," Augustine's Confessions,' Conybeare's ' Saint Paul,' and 5   "      ASPENDALE. Dr. M'Cosh's ' Examination of Mill on Hamil- ton."'  "A good book, that last! A clear, popular resum6 of metaphysical speculation from an Orthodox point of view." "No doubt, dear sir," replied Ignatius, with that pronounced suavity which was his nearest approach to impatience of manner; "but my people won't read it. The very leaves are uncut. I don't see how the book came there. My friends here do not care for metaphysical speculation, nor for the refuting of heresies whereof they scarce have heard; and why. should they? A similar objection applies to Augustine." "Why, surely you have an artless life story there, and a thrilling one!" "Yes; but the time is so remote, the way of living so strange to any but a classical student, the style, for all its solemn music, so antique! I don't think any but very original or very cultivated minds enjoy antiquated books. Even the Pilgrim,-though it has   ASPENDALE.       67 been the fashion, since Macaulay, to speak of him as perpetually young, - even the Pil- grim has not been overwhelmed with atten- tion. The book is clean, and opens with some difficulty. What my friends need is, as I tried to say before, to have their minds refreshed about every-day affairs; their eyes opened to the mystery of common things; their moral sense quickened about practical and universal duties;- books like Tyndall on  Heat and  Light, or 'Tom  Brown at Rughy,' or Herbert Spencer on Education." "Ignatius," cried Zoe, solemnly, " a great career is open before you.  Do not-refuse it!  Leave us not to conclude that you 'fear your fate too much,' since we know your 'desert' is not small! Add to the rich col- lection you have described the books you name, and a few others like them, and observe the effect. See if you arp not soon preaching to quicker ears and wider eyes than hereto- fore." ( But, no," answered Christine: " that could   68       ASPENDALE. not be. This poor little library is a religious one, bought and maintained as such; and books wholly secular, if ever so effective, would be out of place in it." "I'll pay for them! Herbert Spencer in a Sabbath-school library!" . The speaker's accent was gleeful. "The law of indirect effort again," mur- mured the Professor. "Any one who has made a study of human sinners must have felt at some time the futility of blunt exhor. tations to piety. A great law, my friends; one whose spiritual aspect is shadowed forth in that most profound passage of Scripture: 'He who saveth his life shall lose, and he who loseth shall find it.' " "' For my sake and the gospel's.' " "I ought to say," observed Ignatius, "that I only named those particular books as ex- amples, in another order, of what I thought and hoped to find in the religious. I said to myself that, pure fiction apart, almost all the books which have made a great impression   ASPENDALE.       69 in my time have been either professedly religious, or scientific with a religious bear- ing." "Or irreligious." "Yes; but of course I used the word in its widest sense. And I made no doubt that among those bright ones of our contempora- ries, who have had the gift to tell us what we all vaguely think, there must be many who, while accepting the real gains of the age and animated by its spirit, were yet simply and sincerely loyal to the old faith. I still believe these loyal spirits live, but I am forced to conclude that few of them have spokenh. Perhaps I have been hasty; but if so, I don't know where to look for fuller information. In fine, so far as I can see, the sound books are not very able, and the able ones not very sound." "And why not accept the inference?" inquired Zoe, gently this time and with all earnestness. "Because I am not prepared to do so. It z    70       ASPENDALE. involves too much. I would rather recon- sider my own fallible reasoning a thousand times." "We will by no means attempt to define the word ' sound,'" remarked the Professor; "yet I think you need not despair. There must, after all, be a few books which would meet all the intellectual requirements of a not very literate parish, and yet cause no one to offend. What say you to Robertson's Ser- mons, or ' Ecce Homo'? The other Ecces do not greatly signify." . Ignatius shook his head slightly, and glanced as usual for sympathy and support to Christine. "I am afraid," he said, and his tone was almost appealing, "that it would not quite answer. I only wish we might venture on ' Stumbling Blocks' or .' The Gates Ajar."' "Stumbling Blocks"' replied the lady, "they ought to read, and they shall; ' The Gates Ajar' they will. It is what I call a fluid book, finding its own way everywhere,   ASPENDALE.       71 like running water. It deals, if ever so em- pirically, with a question of vital and mortal moment to us all, speaking straight from heart to heart." "It awakens emotion, I suppose, rather than intellection." "If you like to put it so. But for the other books,--Robertson I doubt is too refined for them: his life certainly is so; and of' Ecce Homo' I have thought many things." "May we not hear them?" "It may be," replied Christine, with some diffidence, "that my experience of that re- markable book is quite solitary. Remarkable it certainly is. When I read it first, I should say during my first reading, I was pro- foundly impressed, and even excited. I ap- prehended a crisis in the world's life and in mine. Old things seemed to be passing silently away, and all becoming new. I even considered without alarm, though cer- tainly without enthusiasm, the possibility of substituting for the divine image my heart   72       ASPENDALE. had held so long, this new figure, historically and logically made so probable, of a Heaven- sent philanthropist, stainless and fearless, divining others and denying himself as none had ever done before At least I thought it. a conception of irresistible power. What therefore was my surprise, a month after the volume was finished, to find that my old belief was unshaken, and even unmodified; while that conception had become so blurred and faded that I could hardly recall its out- lines. For this evanescence I at first blamed my' own feminine fatuity, assisted perhaps by the high, cold polish of the then unknown writer's style. After a while I read the book again. Precisely the same result followed. The character portrayed in ' Ecce Homo' never had color, and it seemed incapable of retaining shape. I compared it with the great creations of fiction, - Antigone, Hamlet, Eg- mont, Romola, Irma, with R nan's Jesus even. They were real. This was a ghost. For a while I was amazed. Afterwards I thought   ASPENDALE.       73 I understood the marvel. It was precisely because the writer professed to draw his pic- ture from an evangelical point of view that that picture was so inexpressibly unreal. The ideal of a sceptic, like Strauss or Rdnan, is set over against the transcendent reality. This, placed by its side, is at once smitten with nothingness. Irstead of the hope of eighteen centuries -- hhis! Ah me! I think that man in his most secret heart is always haunted by fear. His tearful adoration of courage shows it. And this is why he wants to be saved. But the subtle, self-conscious philanthropist of ' Ecce Homo' is no Saviour. And if Jesus Christ were none, he is inferior to many a philanthropist." The minister bowed in silence. "And   yet," said the Professor, mildly, "since few, if any, of the now sons of men know for a certainty what that unique Son of man really was, but worship under his name, one his sentiments, another his opinions another his fears; and since many long to v--^ , * X,   74       ASPENDALE. know,--let us condemn no earnest and independent, if ever so futile, effort to discern the truth." A long pause followed, during which the changeful firelight flickered over four variously thoughtful faces; while between the parted curtains, out of the dark depths of the now unclouded heaven, looked in the bright, in- scrutable stars. "We have not helped you much," said Christine, at length, to Ignatius. "Indeed, you have! You always. help me. As much, perhaps, as any man ought to be helped." "At least," said the lady, " we can all take more pains to extend our own privileges, such as they are, and furnish our own reading to anybody who may care for it." "My enemy has found me now!" cried Zoe, flashing out from the clbud of reverie in which she had been involved. "Books are my stinginess: I never lend one without a.' terrible pang." fL    ASPENDALE.      75 Once more the thread of conversation was broken short,--this time by an arrival. A shower of stamps from a pair of small, heeled boots, and-a bluff inquiry for Sally's rheu- matism, in the little hall, announced the Doc- tor and his daughter even before they entered. "Nobody asked me to this party," remarked the latter, with the saucy composure of comely youth, while she suffered Christine and Zoe to disrobe her as if she had been a queen, -"still, I thought I would come. Alcibiades, as you call him, had to leave in the afternoon train; papa was coming over the hills to see a child with measles; and I had no notion of spending my Thanksgiving evening alone.. You were talking of some- thing awfully deep; I know it by your looks. Pray go on. Don't mind me and papa." "Indeed, we were shallow enough." "And we were quite talked out." "I see. You think we should not Under. stand. Well then, Miss Zoe, please play to me," with a glance at the open piao.   76       ASPENDALE. "I second that motion," observed the Doc- tor, now comfortably ensconced. "I like very well to hear Zoe play," witfh an em- phasis that made Ruby pout X "but I wish to make one proviso,- nothing classical! No Sonatas, and no Songs without Words!" Zoe turned her head superbly, and regarded the speaker with wide, calm eyes of pity and amazement. "Yes. yes! I know all about it, and I mean what I say. I love music. Nobody likes a good honest tune better than I do; but I'll not have my ears dazzled, if I may say so, by a rush of amazing harmonies, and my brain set whirling by trying to grasp the unearthly and unintelligible things that they- suggest. Not if I Eknow it! There's too much of this sort of thing in a good many directions nowadays, and it's not wholesome. Two things are spoiled for me by the consciousness of any curious intellectual process,--my music and my prayers. 'Tis the heart which ought to speak in both. Why, the other day   ASPENDALE.      77- in the city they took me to a classical concert. Puffing and panting, I climbed up into a certain high, hot gallery, where they told me the orchestral effect was very fine; and in due time the fun began. Now I'll not deny that for the first fifteen minutes or so I experi- enced a certain purely sensuous pleasure in the consideration -of noise so artistically man- aged. I soon tired, however, and gave over trying to keep pace with it; I then turned my attention to the people about me, most of whom I was told came every fortnight. I'll cheerfully acknowledge that the majority seemed to comprehend what was going on much better than I did; yet it struck me that the marked faces - there was of course the ordinary filling of bright gibbons and frizzled hair -were all of one'type. "They were too knowing by half. They looked morbid and conscious and puzzled, and yet complacent. They looked like the performance to wtich they were attending so devoutly; like the pompous, heterodox ser-   78       ASPENDALE. mons of which they all hear so many; like the incomprehensible books which had previously turned their heads, and yours too, Zoe. I felt I had hooked an idea, and in the pause between two movements I turned to give my companion the benefit of it. Bless me! I haven't got such a withering look since I giggled aloud in the district school on exam- ination afternoon. I understood, however, and waited till the thing was over. It did come to an end at last; and when we were out in the passage, and I had got a breath of fresh air, I testified. ' And this,' said 1, is good old music! Yes,-and the works of the schoolmen are good old reading, and one is about as sensible and as intrinsically beauti- ful as the other. Only an inveterate puzzle- head would pretend to enjoy either, unless it were the fashion.' Several people turned round, and looked at me as only denizens of that city can look; yet here I am, alive to tell the tale!" Zoe bowed, with eyebrows slightly elevated,   I '         ASPENDALE.       79 but did not deign a reply. Ruby was seldom reduced so far. "Well," said that pert damsel, i" since papa has set up for a musical critic, perhaps the company would like my views on the nature and origin of Zymotic diseases." "Oh, by all means." "Ahem! The word ' Zymotic,' my friends, is somehow derived from yeast. It is used to describe a generally stirred-up state of the system. The Zymotic diseases were for- merly supposed to originate in various ways; but it seems now they didn't. A recent authority, my friends, maintains'that there is no material maggot in this case, but that the maladies in question have their origin in a disturbed state of the nervous centres. That is, if a man has the cholera, it is because he is nervous. Ahem!  "Peace, baggage," said her father. 4"A suc- cessful satirist is always master of his sub- ject. He views it from  the outside, because he has been through it. But thou art not   80       ASPENDALE. even ' well-smattered,' as the wittst woman in America hath it. Now  I Understand music! I didn't go to singing-school all my youth for nothing! Come, Zoe, let us hear you play!" Zoe performed "Old Dog Tray" and "John Brown's Body." Ignatius and Ruby applauded her ecstatically. She returned them a sweeping courtesy, and sat down. The Professor, whose face had worn for some time a dreamy smile, now addressed the physician. "You said, with reference to your concert, that you experienced at first a certain purely sensuous pleasure. I am in- clined to think you spoke with scientific accuracy." "Of course I did!" interpolated the Doc- tor. "Since the effect of sound is produced by appreciable vibrations of a material sub- stance, it seems not unreasonable .that the pleasure derived from music should be more' materialistic in its character, more entirely a   ASPENDALE.       81 pleasure of sense, than that which we receive from some of the other arts. And did you remember that a Frenchman, one M. Laprade, had written a book on the relations of art to morality, in which he maintains this very view, and undertakes to show that the high musical culture of the present age is an index, not, as you suggest, to a morbid intel- lectual development, but to the refined sen- sualism of the period?" "No," said the Doctor, "I did not know it, and I don't believe it. Why, music of the right sort is the most spiritual form of art. How about the music in heaven, eh?" "I believe," replied the Professor, smiling, "that the author in question found, both in the careful cultivation of music by Catholo- 'cism, the religion of sense, and in the persist- ent idea of a musical heaven, confirmations of his theory. His notion was, that the nat- ural man is unequal to the conception of a supersensual heaven, and falls back, by an inevitable law of ;reaction, upon the thought 6- /   82       ASPENDALE. of the very delight which would be least likely to find entrance into such a state." "Oh!" cried the minister, with unwonted warmth, "had that Frenchman really a soul?  c' To save and fit it for the sky,' where we shall see and hear Beethoven? Surely not!" "To respond," continued the young divine, a little hurriedly, as though fearful lest the future state should be' misrepresented, "to some of the most direct and irresistible appeals ever made to the religious sentiment? I mean in the sacred music of the great composers. What earthly voices plead for religion if theirs do not?" "They do more!" pursued Zoe the unac- countable. "They actually seem to plead for Orthodoxy! I have often asked myself whether it were simply because the great masters were most of them men of deep piety and rigid convictions, or for some more occult reason, that their wordless arguments seem   ASPENDALE.       83 all to tend .one way, and are, for the instant, unanswerable. I do not think, for example, that I ever heard the ' Hallelujah Chorus ' toler- ably rendered without yielding to a momen- tary conviction that there are redeemed and unredeemed, and that this is the song of the redeemed." As the impetuouslittle fugue ended on this unexpected note, the Doctor wagged his head with great significance and solemnity. "Yet the critical spirit sleeps not,".mur- mured the cloud-borne Professor.  "It is only when the music is tolerably rendered, that our young friend experiences this tempo. rary change of heart." At any rate," quoth the sage, " your man's I view (meaning M. Laprade), if true at all, must be specially true of harmony; since it is harmony, and  not melody, which delights babies and beasts." "And did you remember," asked Zoe of the Professor, "that this same M. Laprade, who certainly is a heathen and a fanatic, had   84       ASPENDALE. been gently extinguished by M. Sainte-Beuve, not at all in the interests of music, but of those of truth generally?" "Sainte-Beuve fighting the heathen!" shouted the Doctor: "that's good!" The minister observed that he had been greatly interested of late in the relations of sound to form, and asked if his friends had' seen any of those beautiful diagrams in which the vibrations of the air, excited by different musical sounds, are recorded in the lines they describe, these lines forming figures infinitely varied, but always symmetrical, and often very beautiful. "xThey pleased me specially," he said, "because musical sounds always sug- gest lines to me. I never hear the one with- out seeing the other." "So much for the difference in brains!" cried Zoe. "It must depend on that, whether the immediate association of music is with form or color. Now with me, it is the latter. One of the sweetest and most mystical things in life to me has always been the relation of   ASPENDALE.       85 sound to color. Not exactly in the sense in which they rave about it in ' Charles Auchester), but thus: Take the seven colors of the spec- trum, as commonly divided, and reverse their order,--that is, begin with the violet,---and you have a perfect major scale, with a half   tone-- between the blue and green. The tri- chord would then be composed of violet, blue, and yellow,-in general terms, gold and purple, the colors of pure sunshine and pure shade; while the dominant would intro- duce the green of foliage shading into indigo, and the morning and the evening red.' Or you may make a minor scale, if you will; only then you must omit the simple turquoise blue, and pass from a slightly modified indigo to green, the shading of the sea, and a combi- nation beautiful in costume to any person of taste; and, again, omit the orange, and pass fromt pale yellow to deep red, another tran- sition charming to an educated eye." "Yet it seems a pity," observed Ignatius, "that you must begin your scale with the   86       ASPENDALE. violet, since the colors whose index of refran- gibility is greater are always reckoned higher in tone than those whose index is less; and, on the undulatory theory, they must be so." B " limporte," answered the undaunted theo- rist. "I'Tis but a confusion of terms. Out Doctor can find us a twist in one of the nerves of special sense which will account for the seeming inconsistency. For it is certain  that the more refrangible rays produce upon the mind the soothing and sedative effect of the lower tones; and the less refrangible, the exhilarating effect of the higher. Florence Nightingale confirms me in her 'Notes on Nursing,' where, she gives it as one of the curious results of her experience that blue flowers in a sick-room quiet a sensitive patient, and red flowers stimulate." "At all, events," said Ruby, " it is delight. ful to know that my Forty-Second  plaid burnous is really beautiful, and why." And she regarded that picturesque garment affec- tionately.   ASPENDALE.      - 7 But Aristocles mused. "Art then is one," he said, "and surely faith is one; and art and faith converge to unite in the highest worship." Another pause succeeded, but the stillness. was less musical than before. The different moods were not now in perfect accord. It was the Doctor who broke silence. "Bless me!" cried that practical individ- 'ual, after a furtive glance at his watch, "it is past eleven o'clock! Ruby, put on your things." And all the guests rose.  A coal darted out from the now glowing fire, and Ruby tossed it back with nimble fingers. "I ought to have put it on your head, dear," she  said to Christine, "'but instead I will invite you all to dine with us on New Year's Day. Now I think of it, that was my principal reason for calling to-night. That boy is coming again, and we shall dine grandly at six o'clock. You will come, all? Thanks!"  And atlast they said good-night. -S   IV. AFTER the informal house-warming described in the last chapter, our ladies found themselves rapidly subsiding into an exceedingly quiet and methodical way of life. Only one incident occurred to diversify the movement of the next few weeks, and suggest a possible element of mutability, even in the calm affairs of Aspendale. It hap- pened thus: On December's briefest day, at the very hour when our Pilgrim Fathers of blessed memory descended on the beach at Plymouth, built a fire of damp wood, and hung thereover the kettle, which has been boiling in pictures of their advent ever since, the train from " down country "' deposited at the village station a stranger of august ap- pearance. He was a smooth-shaven, gray- haired man, well on in middle life, who wore   ASPENDALE.       89 Jouvin's gloves, and whose travelling over- coat concealed the finest of broadcloth. Gold- mounted glasses assisted his scrutiny of the station and its surroundings, and brought home to his cultivated mind the fact that. nothing of a hack nature was in attendance at that sequestered spot. The perplexity aris- ing from this discovery was in a measure relieved by a lounger, who kindly indicated the piazza of the village hotel, and suggested an obvious mode of attaining it. With a distant bow, the new-comer departed; and half an hour later he was seated in, a top- 'buggy with Zebedee, the hostler at Grimes', for a driver, rolling away toward Aspendale. Now it chanced that in this remote hamlet there were two eyes which the stranger would I have preferred just then to avoid; and those eyes, thanks  to night journeys over blind "cross" roads, and the searching of distant horizons for signs of fair or foul -weather, were  of the keenest. In brief, they were the Doctor's, who, from the low doorway of                    ^ ' t. r!   90       ASPENDALE. a cottage near the turn of the road, beheld, recognized, and deemed he read the purposes of a quondam classmate of his own, now a physician, with a city practice and a compara- tively great name,-to the Doctor himself simply and always - "Ben." The homely features of the sage worked with a singular medley of expressions. One instant his eyes ,shone, and his snub nose wrinkled with silent laughter; the next, he looked dubious. Amazement, amusement, and curiosity triumphed by turns; but the latter held possession. Slowly the Doctor unfastened his horse, and turned the head of that long-suffering animal in a direction con- trary to the one he had meant to take. Not exactly toward Aspendale. Oh, no! But off to the northeast of the valley-farm there lay, as has been before remarked, a tract of country which had once been more populous than now. The ebbing of civiliza- tion, strange in so new a country, was sufficiently indicated by certain features of   *   ASPENDALE.       91Q the landscape. There were grassy hollows at intervals, on whose edges old lilacs bloomed in May-time. Above the tangled underbrush of baby-forests a few gnarled apple-trees spread their shrivelled arms abroad, like the mutilated survivors of ancient wars. There was a vigorous young pine-wood crowning a short, grassy slope, within which the surface of the ground, brown and slippery with fallen pine-needles, was also diversified by sharp irregularities, and abounded in a species of protruding  rock, many-lichened and  slaty, and very unlike the granite formation of the neighborhood.  Now the rocks were head- stones, and the mounds were graves. Among the obliterated homes of the living and the dead, a single weather-beaten farm- house gloomily survived. It was tenanted by an evil-minded and bed-ridden crone whom, once in a   year or so, the Doctor felt it his duty to visit: he felt it his duty to-day. This lone dwelling could only be approached by an abandoned road, grass-grown and nearly   92       ASPENDALE. choked by alders and white birches; which road continuing on for a mile or more through swamp. and over pasture, and frequently obstructed by bars, did finally emerge just at ,  .  the back of the Aspendale farm-house, and constituted for the brief remnant of its career a private way from that modest mansion to the travelled road. The physician's course was plain. And here it may be as well frankly to admit a fact to our wise man's disadvantage. He was a --  gossip. The private affairs of his fellow-men possessed the keenest inter- est for him.. Births, marriages, deaths, for- tunes made and lost, engagements of all kinds made and broken, into these things he entered with almost if not quite as much zest as into a microscopic examination. Every striking fact, concerning friend or foe, which came to his knowledge, 'he treasured with care, rehearsed' at length to Ruby at home, and scolded her sharply for tattling, if he heard of her imparting it to anybody else.   ASPENDALE.       93 His case, in this regard. was so peculiar as to be noteworthy. In the shelter of a birch-grove behind the Aspendale house, the Docter tied his horse an hour or two later, stepped somewhat gingerly across the uworm-eaten but clean-swept floor of the wood-shed, and opened with no unnec- essary noite the door communicating with Sally's kitchen, Warm, still, and tidy wasthe place, and erect and excited in its centre stood the genius thereof. "How are you, Sally?" inquired the Doc' tor, striving to appear degage. "Im well," answered the old woman. "Ladies at home? , "They be. 'And there's company,"-with a look that said unutterable things. "Company, eh?" observed the base intru- der. "Who is it, Sally? Anybody I knowt? , " "Like enough," replied Sally, with the glance which women of all orders bestow  upon  a man's stratagem. Then, with a sud- den change of base, , It's a widower, Doctor;   "'      ASPENDALE. and I'd like to know whether he'll get what he's come for!" She expressed the Doctor's own senti- ments; but he could not exactly say so. "How did you know what he was, Sally?" he inquired, opening the door of the stove- oven, and thrusting in his hands. "Laws sake!" burst out Sally, availing herself of the first safety-valve that offered for her accumulated nervous energy. "By obserwation! Am I a fool? Don't I know their ways? Smo6th as ile and soft as silk! Ain't wives always a-dyin', and don't men gen'ally expect to have two? Don't tell me!" Then, remembering the personal bearing of her remarksa "I donit mean no offence. Touchin'-widowers," she added tolerantly, "I honor them as are widowers' indeed, and I know you're one." However gratified by the admission, the Doctor found Sally's assumption of the apos- tolic manner too much for his gravity. After a futile effort to control his muscles, he broke   ASPENDALE.      95 into a laugh which had well-nigh betrayed his guilty presence in the spotless kitchen. Sally drew herself up, and looked offended. "Beg pardon, Sally!" said the sage, as soon as he could speak. "Go ahead now, and give me your views. But stopta minute! Do you speak of yourself, or by inspiration of the Lord?" "For matter o' that," replied the old woman, "I don't know but I've as good a right to say what I think as Paul had. To my mind,he most allus got beyond his depth in talking about women; and I think he felt oneasy about it himself by times, for he was a con- scientious creetur. And, any way, I've never been in any hurry to speak out; but I'm free to say I believe I've got the Lord's sperrit!"- Sinking into a small, stiff rocking-chair, in obedience to a sign from the Doctor, the prophetess went on: "It's been a-growin' on me now this- good many years that the marryin'. of this world ain't well managed; and I don't know, on the whole, as there's a   96      ASPENDALE. more consolin' passage in Scripter than that which says, fair and square, that there won't be none in the next. Now, Doctor, you're aware that I know what I'm talkin' about. The young folks take me for an old maid,-- and welcome! - but you remember that once in my life I was fool enough to marry." "But you were specially unlucky, Sally. And, besides, your husband didn't live a year, did he?" "Thanks to mercy, no! The' Lord took him where I hope he's learnin' better fashions, and saved me from tutnin' into a a fiend incarcerate," added Sally, with the energy of one who has found the right term. "But there,--I don't want to rake over all that. When you come in; my mind was runnin' on what you might call another branch of the same subject." ' The way they do it!" she continued, with a vagueness truly oracular,--" for of course it's got to be done, - the way they rush into it head-foremost! I don't mean giddy young    ASPENDALE.      97 things, now, but middle-aged men and women, used to independence, sot in their ways "-- "You think, perhaps, they had better go in heart-foremost: is that it?" "Mebbe; but that ain't all. 'Taint easy to say what is all," -and the speaker seemed for a moment confused by the pressure of her own unuttered testimony,-" but there's something wrong somewhere, and the men are most to blame." "That's of course!" "Haven't I said I didn't mean you? But look at the one in there!" The interloper would have had no objec- n; but, not being himself gifted with se nd-sight, he found the intervening walls an obstacle. -"Here he comes paradin' up country, and expects one of our ladies to take him out of hand, for better or wuss; at least, it looks like that. Now I don' -know as either on 'em would do it. I may say," added Sally, with 7   98       ASPENDALE. a slight shiver, "I hope and believe they won't; but I've known 'emn - sweet as Miss and bright as t'other, - who wouldn't hesitate a minute, provided the man had plenty of money, like this one seems to have." "Well, Sally, and do you know 'just cause or impediment? '" "Yes, I do! It's an impediment to be asked in that off-hand way! I -had one,' says he, 'and I lost it; and I want another, same pattern, and I can pay for it.' Bah! How often I think of what the black man said in the' Town Hall."  What black man?" "'Why, don't you remember? -in war time. The black man with the white hair, who cracks his hands together like a rifle! Douglas,--that's the name! He was talkin' about vice-presidents. No, it wasn't in war time either: 'twas in Andy's. 'There's no need of any vice-president at all,' says he. ' You no more need an extra president in case one dies, than you need an extra'hus-   ASPENDALE.      99 band! Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' says he; and then they all laughed. 'Besides,' says he, as soon as he could be ) heard,' if there wa'n't another man all ready to take the place, there wouldn't so many presidents die!' Say wives or husbands either, says I to myself, and you've hit it! If there were no second ones to be had, the first wouldn't be so apt to die!" "But I understood you to say that you disapproved of marrying altogether." "It ain't to "be av:ided," answered the Pythoness, with an impatient frown. "' There's the plague on't! But I do say that it ought to be better regilated, and otherwise under- took. Sometimes it seems to me that the ministers make more mischief than they can mend." "O pshaw, Sally!" said her visitor, a good deal diverted, but feeling bound, as a church- member and an old whig, to resist the amaz- ing radicalism of the last suggestion. "You are a little crazed on this topic. Don't you \     '        100      ASPENDALE. see you are attacking the very basis of soci- ety?" The door communicating with the dining- room opened quietly, and Christine came in. Even her fair eyebrows went up a little as she detected the guest by the fire, but she advanced to meet him gracefully. The culprit rose in some confusion. '"Oh!" said he, with the queerest of all passing notes in his voice, "I thought it was you, Ma'am, who were specially engaged." Christine hesitated an instant; then, per- ceiving the futility alike of resentment and concealment where the sage was concerned, she answered, smiling, "I suspect it is neither of us. Our caller has left, and is on his way to the next town. Sally, you can go and replenish the parlor fire. May I ask how you knew he was here?" "Saw him on the road. Zoe indeed!" added the Doctor, relapsing into his cosey corner. "Well, I call that a cool proposi- tion. Now I know Ben's age to a day. He   ASPENDALE.      101 is just- two years and five months younger than I am, which would make him fifty-nine last August. Zoe, indeed! Bless my soul! ' "The difference in age does not seem to me the strongest objection," replied the lady. "Most women pover twenty-five are as old as most men over forty." "Eh? I don't know about that! What is the trouble then?" "Incompatibility, as it is called. Difficulty of fusion after mind and character are fully, formed. Difficulty of formal subordination to a character like Zoe's." "Moonshine! Now Ben could have given her a splendid home,--just the sphere she Would adorn; although perhaps Zoe is hardly the woman to marry for an establishment." "Indeed, no!" answered Christine, with some warmth. "And yet," she added, mu- singly, "I have more than once asked my- self whether it were right, whether it were pardonable even, when the union of a mature man and woman is in question, to disregard ,   102      ASPENDALE. or in any way lightly to esteem this matter of money. On the contrary, I suspect it should be made a capital consideration, and for this reason: nothing so lessens the friction of life as abundant means, and the power of independent action in little thing which they confer. And in a union like-' Christian marriage, close, fatal, practically indissoluble, but after all artificial and as it were merely mechanical, the fribtion is ex- treme." "In some unhappy cases,-- yes." - "In an appalling majority. I think,"-and Christine's voice sank, as the most precious memory of her life returned, ghost-like, to her consciousness.--"I think we may hope \and pray, nay, even innocently plan for the mar- riage of the young and unformed,-those who have some chance of growing together.

"What do you  mean by if?  What sort of notions are held, I wonder, and what sort of here- sies preached, in this which I had  taken- for a household of quiet Christian women?

And is poor, crazed old Sal   104      ASPENDALE' only echoing her betters when she gives me her extraordinary views?" "Ah!" replied Christine, with languid serenity, albeit her nerves were quivering with the concussion of her friend's tones. "I heard you belaboring Sally with the 4 basis of soci- ety,' as I came in; and I privately thought it a trifle unmanly in you. Believe me, there is very little preaching here save when we chance to have a dogmatical friend at our fireside. Whatever (views' we hold, we have reached by independent paths'; and we seldom compare notes. Zoe is still too young, perhaps, too dreamy and too proud, to discuss this class of subjects often or freely: she can act better than she can talk. One of the simplest and sweetest of all friendships exists between her and the Professor; and I think it rarely wise in both of them to be able to per- ceive how much of that sweetness might evaporate were their relation a -nearer and more common one. Sally, whom I freely own for one of us, has been guided to the   ASPENDALE.      105 bleak height whence she surveys the world - of eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, (odd that picture of antediluvian life, is it not?) by the unassisted footsteps of what you are pleased to consider her tottering reason.  And I,--really, my friend," she added, with a sudden change of manner, "I have thought much of these things. I have observed life closely with reference to them. It was natural to me to despise the so-called 'cause of woman,' and to recoil from the whole company of its advocates. Even now, you see, I do not quite relish being called an cagitator. Yet I have come to suspect the existence ofka serious wrong, which is neither X a wrong of woman nor a wrong of man, but a wrong between man and woman, a danger- ous flaw in their mutual relations, which acts uvorably on the moral development of both, and is most conspicuous where those relations are closest. Now if such a wrong exist, and if two old friends and thoroughly sobered people, like you and me, cannot talk about it, who can?"   106      ASPENDALE. "The woman question!" gasped the phy. sician, with a forlorn shake of the head. "The most lady-like person I know is rant- ing on the woman question!" "Nay, the man and woman question! Pray distinguish! 'Tis that, and- not the  narrower fanaticism, which,. despite bluff denials and fastidious disclaimers, is really the ghost that will not be laid, the irrepressi- ble topic of the day." Her auditor grunted, but more calmly. "And what," said he, "is this mutual wrong of man and woman?" "One which is none the less surely a mu- tual wrong because it seems, for the time being, to bear more heavily upon the weaker party, and 'on the side of the oppressor there is power.'" "She talks of oppressors!" cried the sage, lifting his eyes to the smoky ceiling. "What next?" Christine laughed. "We hear," she said, "of wresting Scripture to suit one's own         ../   ASPENDALE.      107 meaning: I fancy it is quite as common to wrest one'smeaning to suit some passage of Scripture. I did it then. Oppressor was certainly a stronger word than I needed, yet let it pass with the comment I have made. What- I mean is this: The constant prepon- derance of brute-force on the part of mankind, as distihguished from womankind, has led to the establishment--the naturalization, as one may say - of correlative vices in the characters of either. Men have the vices of a dominant race,--unconscious selfishness and a strong aptitude for tyranny; women, the vices of a subject race, - cowardice and duplicity. Or, rather, I will borrow Charles Reade's bril- liant summ-ry of the case in ' White Lies,' since that gives both sides. ' Men are self- indulgent and straightforward. Women are self-sacrificing  and  uncandid.'; True, - most true! And to me the most startling aspect of this truth is its frequent exemplifi- cation in married life. I have known men and women--how many, I hardly dare to   108      ASPENDALE. think- who were naturally and indepen- dently of the noblest, but in whom marriage developed the faults so pointedly indicated by Mr. Reade with ever-accelerating rapidity. Day by day and year by year the man grew more selfish and exacting, the woman more untruthful, until the self-denial of the woman had itself become a species of mean- ness, and the honesty of the man mere cru- elty. And the children of such a union, by an inevitable law, were of a lower moral type than either of the parents." Christine paused, but for a wonder received no contradiction. Her interlocutor even- nodded absently, as though he had himself observed the like. "And I will tell you, my friend," she con- tinued, "what I would confess to few, that I have pondered over this class of cases, over the partial blindness in which such bonds are necessarily formed, the deterioration of char- acter which they involve, and the moral -and social obstacles to their rupture, until I have   ASPENDALE.      109 found myself face to face with conclusions so revolutionary that I have recoiled with hor- ror, and resolved, almost, that I would reflect no more. To have questioned, but for' an instant, the sanctions of divine and human law, was to me a source of unspeakable agony and alarm.  Can you guess what sharp tonic revived me?" Her auditor shook his head, obviously in an unrepentant state,- but speechless, and a little awed by the earnestness of her manner. s.  "The writings of George Sand! On the Whole, I know no other author who has treated what'l I have called the man and woman  question- our actual and ideal action upon one another - so exhaustively and so nobly.

Her details are often sufficiently repulsive; her conclusidns, always righteous and consol- ing.- She paints the false ideal in hideous colors ; the true (as in ' Mauprat'), with a free- dom which gives a new breadth and meaning to life. In a union like the one that book portrays, - of souls so rich both by nature and self-conquest, - a union resting on such guarantees, assured by such tests, where would be the element of weakness, the possi- bility of disappointment?" "You know that the exhaustive knowledge which you respect was experimental as well as theoretical?" suggested the Doctor, a little dryly. "Yes," replied the lady, calmly; -"and so none can question its authenticity. Hence- forth one may be as thoroughly informed and fortified as our author, without paying the sickening and perilous price which she incurred. She plunged into a black morass; but it is much to know from her testimony   ASPENDALE.

"All the same, I would not let Ruby read those books." "Perhaps not at present, or alone. If she could study them by your side, it- might be well. The education of our girls -of such of them as have any teachers whatever, beside their own impulses -is extremely timorous and one-sided. Ignorance may be 'bliss,' but it is not necessarily innocence; and I doubt whether it is ever really 'folly to be wise.9'      /' "Well,', said the Doctor, rousing himself after a rather thoughtful Silence, " you Save given me a somewhat remarkable diagnosis. Now what treatment do you propose?" "What a hopeful question!" cried Chris- tine, lightly. "It looks as if you allowed my premises, which I had hardly dared to /   "2      ASPENDALE. hope. I have called the attention of many of my friends, both men and women, to that aphorism of Mr. Reade's which contains the germ of all my heresies; and I have found the women generally ready to acknowledge their share of delinquency, the men very reluctant. Whereby I have been forced to conclude that my sisters were, after all, a little nearer the Kingdom than yourselves. Even the sharp novelist delivers his oracle as an ultimate formula, not as the preamble to a: grand resolution. 'Whereas, the obvious deduction is, that men should henceforth strive !  to be unselfish, and women to be truthful. But since you, my friend, are one step in advance of the rest of your sex,"- "Not a bit of it!" cried the Doctor, stoutly. "I acknowledge what you describe as the 'preponderance of brute force,' and defend it, - glory in it! And I believe that it is seldom oppressively employed." "Then prove your abundant right to its possession by using it magnanimously!

The physician burst into uproarious laugh- ter, in which Christine softly joined. Before the peal had subsided, Sally opened the kitchen  door -for the- third time, and pointed darkly at the kitchen clock. "Come then, Sally," said her mistress, "and make your tea. And do you, my friend, stay and partake it with us, and bless me for providing you with a way of honorable retreat." Nothing loath, the guest obeyed. The natural man in him would fain have quizzed 8   "4      ASPENDALE. Zoe a little; but that young woman bore her- self with such amazing and impenetrable dignity, that he was stricken dumb. .Before he took leave, Christine found an opportunity mildly to suggest silence on what had taken place; and "Certainly! Certainly!" was the sage's heartfelt rejoinder. 'Wherefore in the course of the ensuing week he imparted the substance of the after. noon's events, under seal of strictest secrecy, both to the minister and the Professor; and each of those worthy men heard the tale with interest, and felt his heart swell with cheer- ful acquiescence in the ways of Providence [when all was told.   V.    '  I BEFORE     New-year came the snow. Whiteness on -lawn and homestead roof; whiteness on the mountain where it met the sky; whiteness and silence in the naked woods. Even the faithful evergreens seemed paralyzed by the weight of winter on their trailing boughs. To Christine these signs of Nature's deep repose were welcome; K  but Zoe, with her .passion for warmth and color, resisted and almost resented the change, and gazed upon the pallid-earth with restless eyes. "' Tranced in snow,"' she would say,-- "Who is it tells about the world being tranced in snow? He has hit the-precise expression. Our mother is in a trance. It is terribly like death; and who knows if she will ever wake? For myself, I doubt it. I   "6      ASPENDALE. always doubt the Spring at this uncanny season." "And oh the dignity and the satisfaction of doubt! - n'est-ce pas?" So when, on a certain cloudless morning, Christine was fain to extol the dazzling splen- dor out of doors, the perverse young woman whom she addressed compared it to sunshine on a marble sepulchre. "Sunshine upon snow," she added, in her most dogmatic manner, "is a mockery; painful to the eye, and still more painful in what it suggests. For heaven and earth are now effectually divorced. The one can no more call life out of the other. But to see them face to face, each wearing an irresponsive stare, is shock- ing. Far better, when neutral clouds veil from the common eye the unnatural estrange- ment, and all is gray! '  "You sinful creetur!" exclaimed Sally, who had been standing coffee-pot in hand during this harangue. "Hain't the Lord a right to manage his own weather?"   ASPENDALE.   /   117 On the last day of the year, the plaintive south wind was abroad once more; and Zoe, out' of deference to her friend's prejudices, concealed her joy at the prospect of rain. She heard a beating on the pane and a streaming fronm themaes at night, and fell asleep with vast content, but woke at twelve to find it changed to sharpest hail, and the fickle wind whistling in the north once more. The natural result followed. They opened their eyes next morning on the pitiless glories of a world of ice. As they slipped gayly village-ward in the Doctor's roomy sleigh, Zoe owned the weird exhilaration of the seene, and half forgave the winter in her heart, but would not seem to abandon her old position. "You who confess to a love and longing for diamonds, what think you of this?"' cried Christine, as they sped between the jewelled shrubbery of the winding road. "Diamonds indeed! .Who' dares compare to diamonds these profuse, cheap brilliants, ,    "8      ASPENDALE. that can hardly last a day,--these heaps of tinsel ornament, thrown off by Nature in an hour of play, to that slowest, rarest, most precious of her works, imperishable while the world lasts; fashioned by unknown forces, not to be imitated by any human art?" Zoe then undertook to show that the wintry aspects of nature, however radiant, had never afforded much. inspiration to man,- that winter poetry and winter pictures were almost always comparatively poor, - and challenged Christine to recall one 'passage of highest beauty which should disprove her theory. Memory turned traitor as so often happens, and left a seemingly easy triumph with the author of the sudden question. "I can think of but one," continued Zoe, "which ever moved me much, and that is infinitely wild and sad. Do you remember in ' Aurora Leigh,' - 'It is strange, with what a swell Of yearning passion,- as a snow of ghosts Might beat against the impervious walls of heaven'?   ASPENDALE.      119 (What an idea! The adamantine walls, and- the poor, lost souls,- light, white, inca- pable, innumerable - Ah!" and Zoe shud- dered.. "Madame Swetchine said there ought to be an -ice-inferno for the inhabitants of the north, since fire in any shape would be a comfort to them." Christine had rallied her thoughts by this time. "You asked who  dared compare Nature's temporary to her permanent dia- monds. What think you of Mrs. Browning's own ' Court Lady'? 'Diamonds to fasten the hair, and diamonds to fasten the sleeves; Laces to drop from their rays, like a powder of snow from the eaves.' " "I don't think the powder of snow a very perfect simile for the court lace, yet; thank you for reminding me of the 'Court Lady.' Dear and splendid creature! Did you ever consider what a vindication of the morale of beautiful dress that singular poem contains? I wish every woman who despises personal   120      ASPENDALE. adornment would study it! Who does not see that the court heroine accomplished her solemn and pathetic mission at the hospital, all the more fully for the lace and jewels put on with such deliberate care? A duller woman would have thought them incongru- ous; but she was 'large in judgment and instinct,' no less than 'proud in manners and life.' " "And yet, if any plain, womanly service had devolved on her, a simpler dress would surely have been riore appropriate." "Then she would have donned it in a moment, - and I dare say did, - or torn off her laces for bandages, if pressed for time! But here we are!" It was a very bright Ruby who led them in ouit of the. cold, and a summer-like parlor where they were presently resting. Crimson were its walls and cushions; flowering plants and baskets overflowing with delicate vines beautified all the windows; and, more fascin- ating still to Zoe, came the delicate breath   ASPENDALE.      121 of hot-house flowers from vases on bracket and mantel. Lounging by the fire when they entered, but springing to meet them with profuse attention,. was Ruby's accepted lover, the conjurer of the flowers, looking hardly less like an exotic than they. A graceful Greek was Alcibiades,--the beauty of his college class, and: not abashed by that remembrance, -faultless in attire, and with a florid ele- gance of manner beside which the simple courtesy of Ignatius, when he came, seemed almost rustic. The minister came alone, Aristocles having been unexpectedly detained. It was a disap- pointment to Zoe, between whom and the mild scholar there was a deep and long-estab- lished sympathy, and it made her unwontedly quiet. While Christine and her pastor com- pared parish notes, she sat watching, with a dreamy curiosity such as had often overtaken her in a .arger assembly, Ruby's absolute, contentmnent, her lover's sparkling, superficial   122      ASPENDALE. gayety, the Doctor's vehement earnestness; and found it hard to imagine the two latter, with their moral incompatibility, coinciding, as son and father should, in time to come. She was wrapped in a wholly unpardonable reverie of the sorrows which might be await- ing Ruby on account of these two men, the one so insouciant, the other so positive, when- the Doctor roused her by a blunt personal appeal. "Come, Zoe, why don't you speak? I never knew you to sit still so long before." "Fancy my not being in the mood!" cried Zoe. "I see you don't believe me, yet so it is. I would really rather hear than talk to- day." Th e Doctor poohed vehemently, but grati- fied her whim in the most signal manner before the visit was done. It was evening; and they sat around the glowing grate, while Alcibiades chatted of the city life he loved, and in which he shone; prima donnas and pulpit-stars, the latest   ASPENPALE.      123 fancy in dress and equipage, the latest sensa- tion in literature nor art. Thence the talk3 veered to "  society ; " its extravagance, against which Socrates inveighed in terms (" good" and " set," and not a little hackneyed; its con- stitution and conventions, and those who - give it law. Finally, Alcibiades lightly re- marked that he "believed in the Brahmins," and so fired a train. "Bother the Brahmins!" said the Doctor, getting upright in his arm-chair. "Don't you, retail any such twaddle here, young man!"  "No twaddle at all, sir!- a plain fact, which we gain nothing by denying." "What's a fact?" "That there are distinctly marked grades in our New England society. That we have a certain number of privileged families among us, to one of which itis good luck to belong; for they pretty nearly monopolize such cul- ture, scholarship, and good blood as we have among us, and have done so for several gen- erations."   124      ASPENDALE. "What do you mean by good blood?" "Blood that comes straight from a stiff and stately colonial ancestry, and has been kept pure by comfortable means and gentlemanly habits. For a good many of those old Puri- tans were gentlemen, sir, before they came here; and there's where conventional history has done them some injustice. And I main- tain that, where this was the case, their de- scendants are marked men, and that such a descent is a thing to be proud of, and not only does, but ought to, convey certain aristo- cratic distinctions." "My boy," said the Doctor, confidentially, "I'm sorry, as a matter of taste, to hear you use that word ' aristocratic.' It is sonorous, and has some associations; but it has fallen into bad company of late, and- has become only one whit less vulgar than ' genteel."' "And I'm sorry the word offends you, sir," answered the other, with his airy good-nature, "but 'tis sonorous, as you say; and besides its etymology is suggestive. Come now,   ASPENDALE.      125 have we any right to rebel against the 'sway of the best?" "Bad logic and worse learning," roared the sage. "In the first place, you shifted from the common to the (supposed) derivative meaning of your term,-a shabby fallacy shown up in any text-book. And, secondly, you misrepresented even that derivative meaning. When the word 'aristocracy' was made, it did mnot mean the ' sway of the best.' It had no ethical association whatever. It simply, meant the sway of the upper-ten. Overhaul your Grote for that, if you' don't care to go farther!" "Quarter!" cried Alcibiades. "I withdraw tire term. Let us not talk of aristocrats, but of Brahmins." "Very well," said he, of the elenchus. "Name a Brahmin!" "Your old class-mate, - Nicias." "&A harmless old lady, save when time and his temperament made him a copperhead. He has spent nine-tenths of his allotted   126      ASPENDALE. human term - think of it!- grubbing among the bones of his well-to-do but singularly commonplace ancestry; and to my certain knowledge has never turned up so much as that everlasting Indian arrow-head, which your friend of Brahmin memory somewhere characterizes pleasantly enough. Nicias is a good instance. The last time I went to the city, he called on me as usual, and preached me a lay sermon, which he wound up with a personal appeal: 'Now candidly, Socrates, can you not always tell a man of blood when you see him?' ' Nicias,' said I, ' I can tell a monkey when I see him; and if, as many people suppose, we are all descended from monkeys, why the plainer the ancestral traits come out, the prouder, I suppose, we ought to be!'" "If that answer," replied the young man, "was not personal, it was slightly irrelevant; and in either case it was unworthy of so rigid a logician."  The Doctor never objected to having the   ASPENDALE.      127 laugh turned against himself for a change, and he acquiesced good naturedly. "But, my young friend," he said to Alcibiades, "and my friends, all of you, I have felt for years that I had a testimony to deliver upon this subject; and I think the time has come, so I crave your indulgence." Then Alcibiades nodded his god-like head, as who should say, "Now see our wise man ride a hobby;" and the latter nodded too, but enforced silence with his eye, and went on:  "I suppose, my friends, you all believe, in a general way, that the world is progressing, and that we Americans are a little ahead of the rest of mankind. Hthink-so-too. But mind, I make my profession of social faith i slowly and solemnly, as a man should whose conviction is recent, and who has won it only through heavy doubt and severe struggle. A dozen years ago, I could not have said as much; and even now   I have to climb the highest watch-tower on my little domain, and take the widest view of human affairs I can e 9    128      ASPENDALE. command, to reassure myself about the prog- ress of mankind;. and the moment I get back among the falsities and fooleries of every-day life, I have to begin to cry, 'Lord, help mine unbelief!' Not but that, at twenty, the whole thing looked as plain to me as it does to you young ones, and you have prob- ably got my experience to go through. The flower of your philanthropy will have to fall off, before the wholesome fruit will form. You will have to pass your forty years in the wilderness, your three days of blindness, your midnight vigil by your untried armor, before -9ou will be fit th fight in the world's wars. 'So much you must, and will, unless," with a glance at his principal interlocutor, "some old goose like Nicias gets hold of you, and undertakes to pet you, and to cram your, brains, while they are yet soft, with a miser- able social optimism!" Alcibiades bowed and smiled. "These personal remarks are by the way. We assume that the world is on the move,   ASPENDALE.      129 and the universal Yankee nation  ahead. Now how did we get there? What gave us the start? What is the point we have made in the great game of human destiny on this planet? Wherein is our future more hopeful than that of the more polished civilizations behind us? If I say that we began our national life by disregarding the old lie of caste, you will think it a very trite observa- tion. Trite it may be, but it's true; and all truths will bear reiteration, and some mnst have it. There are truths attested by the consciences of all men, but essentially repug- nant to their selfish instincts, and universally denied by their sluggish and unprincipled practice, and this is -one. It is true that all human beings have an equal natural right to knowledge, to the restlts of art, to personal refinement, to the ho orable responsibilities of social and political power, to all the prizes of life, in short; and it is equally true that no society has ever yet practically acknowledged it. How was it, Alcibiades, in our pre-exist- 9   7 130       ASPENDALE. ence, in that other and fairer Athens that the world saw once, only ' shown by the Fates,' as a nation, alas! and that centuries before her time? Not much real democracy there. Only the first dream of it in a -few large and luminous minds. But for that dream, sir, the Republic died! It was the ' good and honorable' sons of her first families, those superlatively good men, to whom allusion has been made to-night, who, by their instinctive sympathy and secret intrigues with oligarchi- cal Sparta, gave their country her death-blow, as our copperheads would have done in '61 if they could! Your antetype, young man, was a reckless young dare-devil, without one grain of moral sense, who, being a youth of - family and leisure, amused his idle hours by gambling with his country's fate; but even he could not have ruined her without help from the pious, conservative, irreproachable forerunner of our friend Nicias. Why do your hearts burn within you, as you read the story of a petty local struggle called the   ASPENDALE.      131 Peloponnesian War? Because the question we are discussing was opened there; and the * conflict, on whose yet undecided issue the conditions of your own social and political existence depend, was there initiated. O Athens! doomed to go down in that first struggle, - richest-gifted and youngest-smit- ten of the nations, -. it was even so! Pardon my emotion, my friends. This is a subject on which I feel deeply, - a disappointment I have never got over." "Nor I," murmured Zoe, whose keenest national sympathy  was touched by  this appeal. Too fully under way was the orator now to be conscious of the interruption. Fixing his eyes on Marshall's portrait of Lincoln, which hung above the mantel, draped with ghostly southern moss, he went on:- "I have digressed again, but not too far, if, by reminding you of that peerless national life and untimely national death, I have made you feel how old a subject we are on, and   132      ASPENDALE. what vitality there must be in a truth which first dawned dimly on theworld twenty-two hundred years ago, and has been growing better defined in the minds of men through all these centuries of defeat and disappoint- ment. "Don't be alarmed! I don't mean to trace its history. You can do that for yourselves; you all know perhaps when and where the next great exposition came. Did it never occur to you that the essential darkness of the Dark Ages lay in the fact that our truth was, for the time being, utterly forgotten? And when it recurred to the consciences of men, it came with a shock. France went mad about it. All some men and nations can do when their consciences are suddenly awakened is to go mad. Meanwhile we were making a fresh attempt over here to reduce the old principle to practice. The Lord only knows how near we were to a dead failure seven years ago, and at what cost we escaped it. I wish we may be out of danger!

The very reason why political equality was never yet a success is that social equality has not gone along with it." The minister looked as if he would have liked to offer a mild objection here, but the speaker would not brook it. "Of course," he said, "I am not talking of actual but of potential equality. All men and women are not equally rich, equally cultivated, equally fair and refined outside and in; but all have here and now a right and a chance to become so. The barriers which kept apart the different kinds and conditions of men are, for experiment's sake, taken away; and coarse and fine are to be mixed and shaken together until the nation becomes a unit, a homogeneous whole. The founders of our republic conceived the democratic idea d   134      ASPENDALE. pretty clearly, but they had the old element of weakness. They were, almost to a man, practical aristocrats; and the Father of his Country was the stiffest of them all!, And mark my words!-if he had been otherwise, his native Virginia might not be full of waste places to-day.

They are slippery   ASPENDALE.      135 fellows to catch. Show them the futility of their claims to high descent, and they will fall back upon a good ihcome or a collegiate education. They change their premises and contradict their statements unblushingly, but to one point they remain true ' as the needle,' &c.,-to the old, selfish, arrogant instinct of human nature,-' We are not'as other men are, and anybody can see it; and other men shall not be as we are if we can help it. Our superiority shall be enhanced-by the inferiority of somebody else.' Stop a minute, boy,--I have the floor! "I know what you were going to say, but answer me one question.

Oh, yes, you do! And there, I say, is the plague- spot, the mark of the world-old social disease; the proof that you need somebody to dose and fumigate you as I am doing now.

Courteous to your equals and gracious to your inferiors is an   ASPENDALE.      137 Old World rule, handed down from the days of chivalry, and an immense improvement on any that preceded it; but it suits not this meridian. In Heaven's name be simple, frank, natural, with everybody; and never for- get yourself, and teach it to your children in their cradles, that these external distinctions are accidents and of trivial moment, and your bearing will come right of itself. But don't overwhelm that 'sort of people' with profuse and premeditated kindness." Ignatius bowed his entire assent. Chris- tine and Zoe glanced involuntarily -at him, and at one another, and smiled. "And akin to this social vice," continued the orator, " is that which lurks in the com- passionate tone in which it is customary to mention the short-comings of ' new' people, x as they are called. New, indeed! We are all new! How many first-rate families do you suppose we have among us, answering to your description, young man, - families whose 'gentility' has been uninterrupted since   138      ASPENDALE. colonial times? Maybe ten: possibly twenty. But the other day, I was looking over a list of good old New England names, - furnished by one of these young fellows with grand- father on the brain,---and I was interested to identify their representatives in a certain vicinity, the result of my researches being as follows: Number one was borne by an itin- erant wood-sawyer, with a family of dirty, saucy little brats, whose chance in life isn't bad for all that, thank Heaven! Number two figured on the handbills of a fifth-rate professional reader. The master of a small railroad station hard by rejoiced in number three. He was rather stupid about his busi- ness, btt otherwise unobjectionable. Num- ber four was erewhile that of a consumptive shoemaker, my neighbor, who has since - happily for himself - been gathered to his ancestors. A fastidious acquaintance used to say of number five, that if he would lie down in person, and roll over his acres, it would answer them instead of top-dressing.   ASPENDALE.      139 Number -six-a great pet with the atavists, really a grand old name with far-reaching historic associatiops - belonged, a generation ago, to one of the most ill-conditioned and low-lived families I ever knew; and it has taken a long course of English history to neutralize my early associations with it. I tell you it is hard keeping up stock on this soil and in this climate." "Will you allow me to observe " "Not yet! I have a word to say about your friend the ' Autocrat.' We have not heard much of his social theories from him- self lately; and I have sometimes thought that, as a man of humor, he liked to sit still and hear the multitudinous echoes of his own speech resounding from every quarter. Be that as it may, he was the original -spokes- man of the clique to which I allude, thee boldest, and by all odds the brightest, expo- nent of their views; so let us review his teachings a little. "I don't suppose any man of sense will   "O      ASPENDALE. pretend that the pleasant author in question has much misrepresented the facts of New England society. There are among us, mys- terious as it seems, three-story houses, and those which have two or less; men who say now, and men who say naow (though none, so far as I know, who say v'oo); saddest and most inexplicable of all to women,-I won't say ladies,--there are lovely creatures who wear brilliant ' Bay State' shawls, and those who wear a generally dingy East Indian article. But when a man gravely proposes to erect these into capital distinctions, and make them the ground of indefeasible social rights and exclusive intellectual and aesthetic privileges, the case is altered. Our ' Autocrat' is very guarded in his manner-of doing this. 'I am sure,' he says, .' you will all acknowl- -edge the truth of what I say,'- which means, I suppose, 'If you deny this, you are not a Brahmin; ' and elsewhere he observes, deprecatingly, 'Our millionocracy is only a perpetual fact, with a variable human ele-   ASPENDALE.  '141 ment,' - which, of course, is true of every imaginable?ocracy. Even Dukes don't live for ever. Ask the-Marquises! ' And though in the paper in which our philosopher first broaches his theory, - I don't remember to which series it belongs, - much, and even most, of what he says is very good, yet even here the germ is visible which after- wards becomes the most rampant of weeds in ' Elsie Venner.' c Wealth and fashion,' says he, sanctimoniously, drawing down his kindly face, 'are two very solemn realities.' Now this is a good deal like Dr. Tusher's returning thanks to Heaven that 'the small-pox had spared my lord and lady, and swept off the castle domestics;' and still more like the finishing governess whom I once heard tell her pupil she hoped she had noticed the bearing-of a certain young man during the ceremony of admission to church membership, it was so gentlemanly. The truth is, wealth and fashion are realities; but they are not very solemn 'realities. They. are comparatively   "2      ASPENDALE. insignificant ones. Life and death, and sin and shame, and sorrow and repentance, and victory and defeat, are solemn realities, and the others belong to quite a different category. And he who makes them of primary impor- tance distorts his own moral vision; and, if, he attempt to give us pictures of life under these conditions, his perspective will be faulty. And this I suspect to be the secret of much of the undefined discomfort which people of taste feel in contemplating some of our author's most picturesque sketches." Here, perforce, the speaker paused for breath. Alcibiades shrugged his shoulders; but his classic lips remained. closed, and he plainly forbore to comment. It was Igna- tius who spoke,- "Pardon me, but in this case I believe I' understand the 'Autocrat's ' meaning, and I indorse it. Is it any new thought of his, that wealth is a blessing and a safeguard,- yes, one of the greatest and gravest? Do you remember, Sir,-you surely ought,-   ASPENDALE.      143 in the beginning of Plato's 'Republic,'. the gracious old man who sits in his hall rose- crowned for a sadrifice? and who, when Socrates asks him what he feels to have been the chief advantage to himself of the vast wealth he has enjoyed, makes this thoughtful and remarkable answer: Riches contribute greatly to our preservation from even uninten- tional deceit or falsehood, and from that alarm which would attend our departure to the other life, if we owed any sacrifice to a God, or any money to a man.'"       ' "It was the answer of a good man, cer- tainly," said Christine; " but certainly also of a wise one." "Well, well - Let me say my say!"   4 "Your prototype, O my father! never dodged a fair objection." But this was said in a whisper to one admiring ear. "I think it is in the very chapter where the words I last quoted occur, that our friend goes into transports over the self-denying politeness of a beautiful and brilliant woman,   "4      ASPENDALE. whom he once saw at a great party seek out a seedy man with a red bandanna handker- chief, and devote herself to his entertainment. Match me this,' he cries, I ye proud sons and daughters of poverty, who boast of your petty sacrifices; what are they to the glorious self- renunciation of a martyr ins pearls and dia- monds?' Now it was very well, and she who did it was probably an amiable and well-bred woman; but I have seen such things done ostentatiously, by acknowledged queens of the salon, just for the sake of show- ing their omnipotence, and piquing their more distinguished admirers. And, at best, I doh't think it equal to living in a cold room the winter long, that the invalid upstairs may be warm; or subsisting on two meals a day for four years to keep your son in college. Bad perspective again! Our author is half in fun, no doubt; but, after all, the pearls and dia- monds are preternaturally big. '( And here let me remark that the ' Auto- crat' never mentions an awkward, ill-dressed,   ASPENDALE.      145 coarse-spoken individual without making him the subject of a joke; without a kind of - contemptuous titter, such as we reprove in a school-girl, but which amazes us in a man like this. He talks about the 'worthy young man who was lassoed too late;' and the ' red- handed, gloveless undergraduate of bucolic antecedents squirming in his corner;' and in short always Speaks of the clumsy and the countryfied in a manner calculated to wound the feelings of those whom he ' hits,'--- which to my mind is not a mark of good taste, to say nothing of good-breeding. My lot has been cast among the people of ' bucolic ante- cedents.' Among them were, and are, some of the ' Autocrat's' most constant and appre- ciative readers; and I know that his comfort- able and indiscriminate scorn was, in the day of it, hard to bear. "'Tis in precisely the same spirit that our critic dwells on vulgarities of pronunciation. Now no one would rejoice more than I to see a thorough reform in this regard. I wish I 1(1   "6      ASPENDALE. knew the day was coming when we should 'be rich-voiced and pure-spoken as a nation, though I'm afraid that the former in our cli- mate is past praying for. There are a good many of us, I suppose, who cringe a little when we hear ' how' called ' h-aow,' and ' duty' 'dooty,' but we don't all giggle audibly. Somewhere in ' Elsie Venner,' however, our sociologist falls into a patronizing strain, and remarks that 'even provincial human nature sometimes has a touch of sublimity in it;' that there were, after all, in the Revolutionary times, plain officers who talked of their ' rigi- ment' and their ' caounty,' who knew well enough how to say' aim' and 6 fire; ' and that, though the rustic uniform was not unexcep- tionable in its cut and trimmings, it was often found, after the battle, with a hole in the left lapel matching another in the brave heart of the plain country major,' &c.

(Rest his soul! I feel as if I ought to cross myself for naming him now.) "And look you! - I have no doubt my grandfather said rigiment.'  My dear old grandmother I know did till her dying day. But my grandfather left his plough in the furrow to march with his company to the battle of Bunker' Hill. And my granny sat at home all day in the old Essex County farm- house and felt the air tremble with cannon; and in the morning she could bear it no' longer, but harnessed the horse with her own hands, and drove twenty miles to Charles town that she might know the worst. And when she got there, the town was still burning and the blood running in the streets, and his was of it! And do you suppose I91l see a smart essayist mount on my ancestor's sacred grave and apologize for the cut of his coat and the peculiarities of his pronunciation? -Not if I can make his readers see the vulgarity, not to say blasphemy, of' the thing!   "8      ASPENDALE. "As for 'Elsie Venner,' I have been looking it over lately; and I consider it a clever book spoiled by the obtrusive reiteration of the author's social theories. 'Tis a pity; for the story, as a story, is original and full of power. But no novel is the better as a work of art for having been written with a purpose, much less when -that purpose is a silly one. The purpose of ' Elsie Venner' is to establish the fact of genuine caste among us. All else is 'subordinated to this,-- subtle physiological inquiries, pictures of inland life in New Eng- land, well discriminated differences of religious belief. The sketch of the rival churches on the two hills comically likened to a pair of fighting cocks is accompanied by the grave statement that in many parts of New Eng- land all people of a certain breeding are expected to be either Unitarians or Episcopa- lians. Once more, I say it may be so; but how in Heaven's name can a man like this one complacently state the fact, and fail to express his regret at the deep-seated snobbish- ness which it implies?   ASPENDALE.      149 "But perhaps it is as well that our author has taken space fully to develop his ideas upon this subject, else, he contradicts himself so freely, we might never have known what the basis of his elaborately wrought social division really is. He can't say as much on the subject as, he does in his novel, without betraying himself; and, as you close the book, it dawns upon you that the idol at whose inauguration you have been assisting is no figment of blood and birth, but that elder god, Mammon!   In one of Mr. Herbert Spen- cer's essays, he analyzes the fashionable taste, in certain matters of personal adornment, telling off a Jlong list of instances, and sum- ming up as usual with a cheerful and tri- umphant   generalization.  We like things because they are expensive. This is the true secret of our fondness for diamonds, for hand- made   lace and hand-wrought scarfs and shawls; and a little reflection will convince us that this- is also the secret of .the 'Autocrat's' reverence for three-story houses and his holy ,.                  Y   150      ASPENDALE. horror of hair-cloth. And how does he dis. pose of his hero, on whose positiop as the scion of a poor but illustrious house great stress is laid, if I remember rightly, in the earlier chapters of the narrative? What is our young Brahmin's reward for keeping his shirt-front clean and his speech pure. through the -usual series of trying experiences and fatal accidents? Why, he marries the daugh- ter of a millionnaire, and settles down among those swell-fronts and south exposures for which the author expresses so naive a prefer- ence! Evidently he feels that objections may be raised against this consummation on the ground of the improbable splendor of the hero's destiny. The latter's good Mentor is quite indignant. 'What right has he,' cries this worldly-wise mortal, 'to aspire to the hand of a daughter of Billyuns Brothers?' But when he finds the young people are reallyattached, he acquiesces iri the mesalli. ance. And, mind you, the young lady herself could not have been a Brahmin because her   ASPENDALE.      151 grandfather - capitally drawn, that old minister! - did not belong to either of the well-bred denominations." "So S 'tis money after all.' Well, even here I think the witty writer's instinct is reliable. Have we not all seen, in some of our older cities, the families who really have the silver tankards and the old portraits and the toy-china overlooked, overpowered, and overridden- by the 'younger millionocracy? And the tameness with-which the former submit to the latter- and often, alas! the assiduity with which they court them - does riot speak well for the efficacy of the great educators above-named in keeping up the quality of the blood, if that has aught to do with the dignity of the character. "One word more! - I named just now the       f,   / name of Abraham Lincoln. Were you aware that the I Autocrat' prophesied of him? He did. It was given this social seer, in one of his' inspired moments, to say something like the following: 'It has happened hitherto,   152      ASPENDALE. so far as my limited knowledge goes, that the President of the United States has always been what might be called, in general terms, a gentleman. But what if, at some future time, the choice of the people should fall on one on whom this title could not, by any stretch of charity, be conferred? This may happen,-how soon, the future only knows. Think of the miserable man of coming polit- ical possibilities!- the unpresentable boor, sucked into office by an eddy in public senti- ment. Think of him, and of the concentrated gaze of good society fixed upon the wretched object,' &c, "Now the crisis, here so pathetically de- scribed, was, as you know, close at hand when these words were written. The hour and the -man were almost here. James Bu- chanan, who, according to all the ' Autocrat's' rules, was a gentleman, went out, and Abra- ham Lincoln, who could not have stood one of his tests, came in. He came immediately from a 'two-story' house, originally from a   ASPENDALE.      153 log-hut. He was unpresentable. He was a r  boor. He sat with his legs crossed. His hands did not take kindly to French gloves. All good society could do at his advent was to turn its eyes away from the spectacle, and sigh for the days of the 'old public func- tionary.' But the new President happened to have his head and hands full of eminently serious matters, and I never heard that he was made as wretched' by the sentence of this august tribunal as our author had antici- pated. He was not a gentleman. He was only the truest patriot and the whitest soul the world had seen for centuries. He was not a gentleman; but high and low, rich and poor, ran clamoring to him in the Tour of mortal danger; and he led this nation, not haughtily, as the old-time leaders did, but humbly, as  the" new-time leaders must, through the valley of the shadow of death. He was not a gentleman. He never had the training of the schools; but he spoke those words at Gettysburg, which one of the sever-   154      ASPENDALE. est literary critics of the day pronounces the finest that ever fell from human lips, and he penned that last inaugural, wMich a world read in solemn silence, as if with a presentiment that it was his dying prayer. Those sentences were shaped on no academic model. Their inspiration was caught by intercourse with a circle of spirits more select than academi- cians, and they have taken their place among the few utterances which will live while the world lives, whetler there be conscious effort to preserve them or not, and stir and strengthen the divinity in man till the race is no more. pNot a gentleman, but a martyr; one of those of whom the world and the glory of it are not thought worthy, and we seek his prototype in vain among the kings of men, because-because-where do we seek it? Did any of you, I wonder, read of his simple entry into the city of his- enemies, welcomed only by the blessings of those common people who heard of his coming so gladly; and then of the base hand that   ASPENDALE.      155 smote him on Good Friday night, without an awe-struck remembrance of another martyr, whose death was found expedient that a whole nation might not perish? O mny chil- dren. to whom it has been given to see with your young eyes this pre-eminent example, why not choose, this night, whom you will serve; whether the  mincing Mammon  of fashionable worship, or Him who led this greater son of the fathers in the cloud and through the sea?" He paused; and for a moment the shade of the Martyr seemed standing in the midst of them, with rugged features, and kind, sad eyes, gently reproving all false standards and petty ambitions, and tenderly beckoning toward those eternal verities in whose pres- ence he lived, and in whose cause he died. The next, the ringing vAoice'of Alcibiades was heard, proposing a vote of thanks to their venerable friend'" for  his able -and spirited tirade."      ,' The silver accent sounded " out of tune and   156      ASPENDALE. harsh." A deeper chord had been touched than any within the compass of that easy, epicurean nature. Not Christine, with her inborn conservatism; nor Ignatius, over some of whose early associations the Doctor had rid- den rough-shod; nor Zoe, whose taste he was perpetually offending,- could jest in the pres- ence he had invoked, nor parry with raillery a moral appeal. The evening ended gravely. At a late hour, when our ladies sat in the sleigh, well muffled for departure, and Alci- biades arranged their carriage-wraps with most engaging assiduity, while the keen wind lifted his wavy hair, he made a last comment on what h'ad beel said:- "I never thought that city clique treated our Doctor quite fairly. They snub his ex- periments;' they discredit his discoveries; they cannot away with his Orthodoxy. No wonder he has a little venom for them, each and all." Zoe replied before Christine. "I do not call it venom. I call it conviction, -a thing   ASPENDALE.     157 which, while I cannot fully appreciate, I always revere." So they made their adieux, and glided away beneath the wan light of a full moon, shining dimly within an ominous circle of illuminated vapor. 4        X      V. THE winter proved a severe one. The storm which the aureoled moon had heralded on New Year's night was but the first of a series which piled the white drifts to a prodigious height, and really seemed almost to justify Zoe's whimsical despair of spring. That spoiled child, as Christine sometimes called her, soon ceased all audible complaint, but grew so quiet in her ways and wistful in her glances that her elder friend became troubled on her behalf, and said to herself, that with a person of Zoe's tempera- ment rebellion is always a more healthful symptom than resignation. Sally, too, sound- ed a cracked note of warning, and prescribed for the case certain herb-teas, the bare men- tion whereof Zoe assured her anxious friends   ASPENDALE.      159 was a better tonic than the decoctions them- selves could ever be. "On  an ultra homceopathic principle, I suppose," said Christine. "And yet," she added, as they sat together on a certain steel- blue February twilight, and she found herself forced to confess that Zoe was actually pale,. "I do not think I should ever have allowed you to pass a whole winter there, and you are not to pass another." "But I shall," replied Zoe, promptly. "I shall spend many winters here, if I live, -- as live I will,--and each more satisfying than the last. I will confess that I am not yet quite acclimated. I don't mean 'my frame, particularly: I am only suffering from a tem- porary ebbing of vitality, such as I have often experienced before, and always it is followed by a  flow. But my mind is not entirely at home: I do not fully understand the ways of nature in this quiet place. For example,-- you will laugh,--the utter stillness of a tre- mendous snow-fall here among the hills   160  .    ASPENDALE. appalls me with a sense of stealthy danger. I like the loud fury of my own coast-storms better. They at least tell of life and desper- ate struggle, but these suggest despair. Another difficulty is that I am not quite old enough. What would our lovers, or even our pastor, say to that? Heaven knows, I hardly regret my youth. It was a harassed time; but I do long for the full immunities and genuine repose of years. "The other day I took down Smyth's Lect- ures on Modern History, which I studied with my Professor years ago. What fascinating study and what a noble book! It gave me my first conception and permanent ideal of philosophical history. How dispassionate the author is and how considerate of all man- kind! The brilliant partisans who plead history to-day are, to me, grotesque beside him. And as I turned the well-worn pages, I came upon a passage which had acquired a new meaning for me since the days of abstracts and recitations: ' Time, which im-   ASPENDALE.       161 proves us not in many respects, improves us very materially in some. By mitigating our rage for selfish pleasures, it renders the mind accessible to larger and more dignified anxie- ties.' I reflected that I was just now in a transition state between the two thus indi- cated, and that transitions are always uncom- fortable; but ere long I thought, unless some unforeseen accident retards the progress of my years, I may become as wise as this magnanimous author, or as Christine her- self." "Too soon, I fear." "Only just at present I have strayed into a labyrinth of melancholy thought. Certain dreadful. old questions beset me, and the silence gives them power." "I knew it,"' replied Christine," and could wish you had less leisure to attend their cry. I am better off than you in having more human   interests and  associations in this place. Practical duties are a safer employ- ment than insoluble problems." "   162      ASPENDALE. "Is that original?" "It is in the sense in which all self-evident truths are so. Leave therefore your listless studies and your vain speculations, and come with me to - the sewing-circle!" '"Not until I am clearer about free-will and " moral responsibility than now." "But what becomes of your resolution to study New England country life?" "I am studying it after a fashion,- theo- retically, deductively. The subject suggests half my puzzles. I wish I could see Aristo- cles. What an age sincejhe was here! Noth- ing ever enlivens me like having a good (metaphoricaD cry'with him. We preserve in our friendship a remembrance of the con- fessional." A'week or two later, Christine went to the village, leaving Zoe alone. The day was one of singular beauty. Suddenly, mysteriously, the rigor of the winter had yielded and seemed gone. The sun rode high, the cocks crowed lazily in the door-yard; the west wind   ASPENDALE.      163 blew softly, the eaves rained. An indescrib- ably tender tint pervaded the sky. A lumi- nous, throbbing haze blended the outlines and enriched the pale coloring of the land- scape. No days in all the New England year more move the heart than these relenting days. Memory and hope are " idly stirred " by them; perhaps, who knows, with the first stirring of the sap within the tree. But Zoe, as she sat beneath the ivy-leaves, was dreaming of old sorrows which were not her own. It so happened that on the morn- ing of that day she and Christine had reviewed a certain painful episode in the life of the latter, of which they seldom spoke;, the. miisery of a man doomed to defeat and. disaster, whereof, however' unwillingly' that gentle woman had been the chief part. The, tragical story of this poor soul, whose be- nighted vigil had been relieved long since, and all his vague bewilderment dispelled, had taken possession of Zoe in her solitude. To her aroused imagination, it clothed itself in   164      ASPENDALE. all the pathos of the day, it resumed all the dark inquiries which had besieged and ex- hausted her in the winter weeks now ending. Might that soul speak to her, she thought, it could tell her quickly all she longed to know. Yet would she dare to question it? She was so absorbed that she heard no unusual stir in the porch, and started with surprise when the Professor came in. He watched her while she greeted him; and when they were seated face to face, he said without preamble, in the tone he had been wont to use when the disparity in their ages had been more marked than now, "Well, child, what is amiss?  "Did Christine send you?" asked Zoe, quickly. "She only hastened me. I had meant to come. I think if she had not chanced to meet me in the village, she would have sent the Doctor instead." "Thank Heaven for your meeting then! But," she added, lifting her gray eyes to the   ASPENDALE.      165 compassionate face, "I am not going to state my world-old troubles in so many words. They wTould sound too trite. A story I will tell you, but not mine, and you shall give me its moral. You never heard it; Christine could not object; and I choose to be helped by 'the law of indirect effort,' if at all-" The artful creature knew that this would please him. "Say what you will," he answered, "I always hear with pleasure." "But the story is a long one, and may tire you." "Impossible, unless you were tired in the telling." a Did you ever know a woman unable to be eloquent? Ah, smile your last, my friend, for one hour'! You will not smile when I have told my tale. "It all happened in the lifetime of Chris. tine's father, at Brookhouse,-that cozy, graceful home which nobody who once visited ever forgot. The scapegrace brother was the only shadow there, and even he had   166      ASPENDALE. delightful manners. I was with them a great deal in those years, and knew almost all their frequent guests, a very charming set. They were all more or less in love with Chris- tine. She is, you know, a woman in whom the ewige weibliche has ever been so rich and potent that she charmed as easily and surely at thirty-five as she had-.at twenty, and drew within her pure sphere by an irresistible V attraction all men whatever, and all noble women. But once, on returning to Brook- house after a longer absence than usual, I found domesticated there a queer, gaunt individual, shambling in gait, countrified in attire, so ludicrously unlike the clique, that 1 regarded him with speechless wonder all the first evening, and at my earliest opportunity began to question Christine with the true flippancy of my age and sex. "' You seem to have a new admirer.' "(I trust you are mistaken,' she answered with a fervor and seriousness that surprised me.  "I laughed. 'The trial is not so unusual a   ASPENDALE.      167 one that the mention of it need overcome you, I said. o' I assure you,' she exclaimed,' if I believed your jest any thing more than a jest, I should be deeply pained. Personal annoyance quite apart, it would seem to me a sad, almost a cruel thing.' "Being in a teasing mood, I declined to enter at once into this sombre view of the case, but remarked that evidently the idea was not new to her; moreover, that I saw no  reason why this interesting youth - I will call him Paul, no matter for his other name - should be exempted from the discipline which had been deemed necessary for so many of his contemporaries. "She smiled faintly then; but said, 'Be- cause this poor old youth, who was never young, has already undergone so strange and 'severe a discipline, that he see rs to me one of those laden "'with burdens too heavy to be borne." I cannot have him ridiculed. Will you be quiet while I tell you his story?'   168      ASPENDALE. "I replied that I would, willingly; that she could generally contrive to make the story of any human being entertaining, though in the present instance the point of interest would seem to be to determine whether the hero were a madman or a -fool. "She shook her head, but did not reprove me as I had expected. 'A mad man or a fool,' she repeated, musingly. 'He is cer- tainly neither the one nor the other. What is he then, or, rather, what is he not?' "She then told me what I will tell you. She had never seen this man until some months before, but had heard of him all her life. First, as a precociously pious and learned infant, then as a youth of moody eccentri- cities and total lack of energy. They were distant relatives, -third cousins, or some- thing of that sort, and her earliestideas of him were derived from a common great-aunt, in whom the gossiping faculty had attained a kind of sublime development. The days of this worthy, whom I had never chanced to   ASPENDALE.      169 see, were passed in visiting from house to; house among a great circle of connections; and Christine said she had always hailed with joy her annual advent, for her stories were better than half the novels.  She had much to say of the family of this man, on whose great, lonely Vermont farm she usually spent the summer months. Christine judged from her aunt's account, and from what' Paul himself had told her, that the mother was no- common petion, but as supe- rior in mind as she was amiable in disposition, only somewhat crushed by her husband, who was crabbed and narrow, like too many of his class. The old lady's strong outlines, filled up by Paul's own plaintive confessions- since he had been at Brookhouse, made so distinct a picture that Christine felt,% and. made me feel the same, as if she had lived the lean and formal life of that bare farm- house, and known poor Paul in his sombre infancy. 'From  babyhood up,' said our friend, ' he was uncomfortably unlike other   170      ASPENDALE. children. He was slow, solemn, and shy He took small pleasure in youthful sports, and was so awykward and timid thereat that little boys mocked and little girls marvelled at him. He would stand like a small frag- ment of Stonehenge in the midst of an active game, catching no merry infection from the rush of breezy life about him, and seeming utterly at a loss to discover his own con- nection with it. He was' a good child, correct and conscientious to a trying degree; a remarkably good scholar too, as they used to say of juveniles who could repeat with ter- rible fluency that abstruse jargon called Eng- lish Grammar, and "do long sums"7 in the head. But with all his virtues and his pro- ficiency there was so little about him that was natural, boyish, and winning, that, while necessarily unpopular with the happy dunces of his age and class, he hardly gained the hearts even of the school-committee. Now and then, I believe, his old minister would stroke his thin, flagen hair, and foretell for him a   ASPENDALE.      171 career of unsmiling usefulness; and some- times perhaps the harassed " mistress," who kept the summer district school, would glance at his stolid little figure with relief, as if it were a kind of " rock in a weary land;" but never a manly and efficient " master" assumed the ferule on the Monday after Thanksgiving who did not come to feel, and sooner or later to betray, for the child an unreasonable antip- athy. There was not a curly-headed little tra'nsgressor, from whose blue jacket the dust had arisen in a cloud at the lash of the rod, but came nearer to the " master's " heart than Paul. And the bitterness of the thing was, that the boy realized it fully. "Out of school, his playmates bullied him in every conceivable way; and it was not in his nature to respond to their affronts, otherwise than by a kind of aggrieved, bewildered pa- tience.' I remember laughing a little when Christine told me this, and 'her comment on my amusement. Well, weak and wanting as he was, I atn quite sure he was never   172      ASPENDALE. mean; and I shall convince you before Ihave  done that he has been only unfortunate, never contemptible.' "'It was well for him that he had a friend at home. His father was habitually harsh with him. It was impossible to make him useful about the farm, like other boys of his age, for this one was as forceless and unhandy at work as at play; and the father seems to have chafed alike under the burden and the supposed disgrace of his inefficiency. He had sisters too, both older than himself, and strongly resembling their father in character, who, Paul had told Christine, were always taunting him with .his girlishness. -But his mother,- she always understood him; she never failed to be kind. To her alone, of all the world, he could see he was not hopelessly aggravating and queer. She took him as he was, with all his melancholy and unchildlike oddities, and loved him with a wonderful love. He said he felt a wordless assurance that he came nearer to his mother's heart   r   .  ASPENDALE.      173 than any other living being; and he knew she shielded him, whenever this was possible, from his father's unreasoning blame. 'Yet I am  ssure also,' added Christine, 'from what I have heard aunt say, that she was no weak and foolish parent. She must have been well-nigh as wise as tender; only human wisdom seemed at fault, the boy's case was so utterly exceptional. She did what she could to brighten his sober little existence, to warm his chilled affections and his half-torpid physical activities, urging him to return -in kind the rofgh attentions of the boys. And then, I suppose, the doleful young face pleaded the incapacity the lips could not de- scribe, and she would say, "Oh, well! Never mind;" and in the cheery patience of those simple words the boy read-Heaven knows how- that it was chiefly for his own sake his- mother grieved to see him unlike others, that she could bear it well if he could; and so, though his youth was strangely shadowed, he was not left comfortless.'   174      ASPENDALE. "As he grew older, his peculiarities strengthened; and he also became more acutely sensitive to them. SA shrinking tim- idity, a wretched mauvaise -onte, made him absurd as a young man, where, as a child, he had been simply odd. His physical cow- ardice continued a byword.  Among his ridiculous fears was an uncontrollable dread of walking on ice. Yet once he saved a little girl from  drowning, who had fallen - through a hole in the ice in the middle of a pond. He heard her screams as he was pass- ing along the road above, rushed out and rescued her, but never afterward knew what to make of his own temerity. Christine said that Paul himself had spoken to her about saving this child's life, and remarked, with the abject air which used afterward to irritate me so profoundly, that it was a great mys- tery to him how he did it. Perhaps he was carried out of his poor self by the mortal terror in the little one's tones; for he appears not to .have realized what he was doing, and   ASPENDALE.      175 never to have had such another daring im- pulse before or since. "Unless, and Christine herself smiled when she told of this, it was when he offered to escort the belle of the village home from sewing-circle. She was a very beauti- ful girl, the despair of half the youths in her vicinity, and has since shone in at far more polished circle of society than that to which she was born. I can well imagine the kind of dumb appeal with which Paul's eyes used to follow her; but she, I believe, was as sim- ple-hearted as she was fair, and, not having the alert vanity which would have translated - that look into a tribute to her charms, it had never occurred to her to reckon among her admirers that sorry, uncouth Paul. So when, one snowy night, in advance of all her usual beaux, he rushed out into the freezing little hall where she was cloaking, and incoherently proffered his escort, she accepted it graciously enough, but could not quench the merry light that danced into her eyes; anrd Paul   176      ASPENDALE. saw it, and -it stung and scared him. And when they had somehow got outside and were struggling homeward through the snow- fall, and she very frank and social, he heard the laugh in all- her silvery tones, -the sad, suspicious mortal, he felt it in every quiver of her frame; he was sure that walk would fur- nish themt .for endless merriment; he would have been glad to fly. When at length they reached their destination, he bade her a choking good-night, and never offered to protect a damsel on her homeward way again. Indeed, he began to shun all young society; begging off from the rustic gayeties in which his sisters' hearts delighted, and liking best to bring his books to the home fireside. His sole aptitude, and it was no mean one, was still for study; and though, even here, he must have lacked enthusiasm, yet sitting and reading in his mother's kindly company, he experienced a repose, a subdued content, which in truth was what earth offered him instead of happiness.   ASPENDALE.      1" "These things occurred when he was about' eighteen years old, and I think it must have been in the spring of the same ygar that there was a 'revival' in Paul's native town, and he was one of its subjects. Christine confessed that there was- no part of Paul's story which moved and disturbed her like whfat he said of this supposed crisis in his spiritual life. Here, according to the belief she cherishes, he should have found strength for his weakness, cheer for his despondency, a new and powerful motive for action, a hope for the heavenly future, which should also have shed light upon the earthly. He found only a delusive promise of these things. There was a little time, apparently while the local: religious excitement lasted, in which he really felt -I use the set phrase with some. thing more or less than its usual meaning- as if he had been the subject of a 'quicken- ing change.' All his energies seemed re- freshed. He seemed to have found some point of sympathy with his fellow-creatures, 12   178      ASPENDALE. some means even of. influencing them. He had shown Christine in his mother's ' Pilgrim's Progress' a picture of Christian losing his burden at the cross, very coarse and quaint; and told her that he could never look at it in those days without tears. Had he not, all his life, borne a nameless but most oppressive burden, and was he really to be utterly relieved? You know that, to those whose hearts are thus stirred, the rural church of New England opens one narrow way, and that way he meekly entered. And it seems that the old frequenters of the weekly prayer- meeting were strangely affected the first time he rose and offered prayer among them. In all he said there breathed a depth of humility, a completeness of self-renunciation, a kind of passionate gratitude for the divine help his troubled spirit had unexpectedly received, which seemed to these good people woh- drous evidences of grace. It appeared as if they had never known what David meant by that faltering cry at the close of the seventy-    ASPENDALE.      179 third Psalm, till they heard it repeated in- Paul's high-pitched- and tremulous tones: ' Whom have I in heaven but Thee; and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee?' ' My heart and my flesh faileth, but God is the strength of my heart and my por- tion for ever.' They thought he was to be a shining light in their severe and formal little church, and then it was that people began to urge upon his unwilling father the duty of educating Paul for the ministry. I cannot understand how the man was ever induced to do this. I -think he could hardly have been- much moved by the pious mother's pleadings, who now for- the first time saw an honorable and blessed career open to' the child over whom she had so yearned. Perhaps he stood in awe of the clergyman, who pressed the matter strongly, and was, I believe, a man of personal power, -and in that community the priest's authority was hardly questioned;- at all events he did yield grudgingly, and Paul was sent to college.   180      ASPENDALE. "And then, Christine said, the warmth of that recent glow of feeling faded, and in twenty slow years it had never returned. He had poured out his heart to her upon this subject and she could not, she said, check his confidences, when she thought what he had suffered from concealment in those years. She knew that his religious emotions had been torpid, and his religious belief perpetu- ally assailed; while yet, for his wretched life, he dared' not face a doubt. Worse still, he was haunted by an awful suspicion that he had 'fallen away from grace;' and however thick the cloud upon the heavenly future, you may be sure there was dreadful clearness in his view of that other state which he could not have grown up without many times hearing circumstantially described. Strange enough, is it not, that one may be born into this world unfit to taste its pleasures or cope with its work; but how much ghasther the notion, if it could be en- tertained, that one may be naturally disqual- ified for a better!   ASPENDALE.      181 "Christine knew little about his life in college or the theological school; for he went through both. It is certain that his rank in his class was invariably good, and even high; but that he lived completely isolated, and seemed to have no point of contact with his fellow-students. As for his spiritual state, he hardly dared acknowledge it even to him- self, still less reveal it to another; but he seems to have had a delicate sense of honor, and to have shrunk continually from the false position in which be- found himself. He said the- hopes that his mother founded on his future ,were a source of ineffable misery to him. At last came the trial of his first ser- mon. It seems unfortunate that it should have been preached in his native parish, but perhaps it made no difference. Somehow the ' stated supply' of the village pulpit failed unexpectedly, and he was summoned late Saturday night to make good the deficiency. He dared not refuse; but between actual physical dread of facing his townsmen from   182      ASPENDALE. the sacred desk, and profound conviction of his moral unfitness for the office, he passed a night of sleepless agony, and entered the church next day confused and worn. I will not pretend to describe that day as he had described it to Christine; but there can be no doubt that he made an utter and shameful fail- ure. When he rose to offer prayer, he was appalled at what seemed to him the mockery of the act. He' could not uplift his own heart in worship, and how could he hope to upbear that of his audience? One gigantic phantom of himself filled all his mind's horizon, and shut out every thing beyond and above. He forgot the set phrases and hackneyed quota- tions which might have indorsed to that assembly his cold and wandering attempts at petition, and in the eyes of it he read a 'hard dissatisfaction with his miserable effort. "Then his sermon, - Christine had read it. She did not wonder that its dreary intellect- uality oppressed and irritated his homely hearers; and I can believe that it gained no   ASPENDALE.      183 power or meaning from his unsteady voice, or trembling lips. Before he had hurried half through his frigid performance, all the more acute of his audience were doubting his sanity or- his orthodoxy, in their minds probably nearly synonymous terms. He told Christine that he should never have attempted the afternoon service but for the thought of his mother, who sat in the corner of the fam- ily pew, pale and disquieted, and trying in vain to realize - poor, dear lady! -that the day she had so long hoped and prayed to see had come. For her sake, he made the des- perate effort; but nature gave way under the strain, and he became faint in the very first paragraph of his afternoon discourse. The services were then hastily closed, and he was carried home. That night, while his mother stood and bathed his hot forehead, he seized her hand in wild appeal for her forgiveness, and spoke out the thought of his heart: ' Mother, I shall never preach again.' '0 Paul!' said the poor lady, and that was all, \ .   .   184      ASPENDALE. - not another word of reproach; but he said he knew then, as well as afterwards, that he had given her a mortal blow, and the agony of his own disgrace was lost in the agony of her disappointment. His father, I believe, swore that Paul had better not preach again unless he could do himself more credit than on that unhappy Sunday; and so they came to a bitter understanding among themselves. Paul remained at home, listless and melan- choly. The kindest of his friends considered him mentally deranged, and even wondered that he was not removed to an asylum.. Very soon his mother's health began visibly to fail. Both the daughters were now married, and living at a distance, and all the care of the invalid devolved upon Paul. No dying mother ever had a tenderer nurse. All those little offices for the sick in which women are supposed to be peculiarly proficient, he per- formed with the greatest delicacy and skill. He never left her; and in the last distressing stages of her decline he was night after night   ASPENDALE.      185 at her bedside, and seemed to know no need of rest. He closed her eyes; and I think no motherless child was ever left more truly des- olate. 'From that time, Christine said, he had lived alone with his father. Fancy that loveless, joyless life! His support an irk- ssome burden, though his father was rich for a country farmer; himself a man, in stature and in years, yet less able to throw off the yoke of his dependence than any poor soldier crippled in the war. In the summer, he ren- dered feeble and despised assistance about the farm business. In the winter, he still pored over his books, mechanically, and witlh- out heart. Not the least poignant circumn- stance of his doom appears to have been this, 'that even in study he could never find the rest and relief which it affords to us others. He could not lose himself in the life of other ages and other orders of being, as healthful- minded students can, but dragged wearily after him, through science and history, the   186      ASPENDALE. galling consciousness of his own incurable mental deformity. If it were mental - But who shall say where his disability lay? He had even then collected valuable information, such as might have brought any other man fame and wealth; but with hirm it was des- tined always to remain a monstrous and unfruitful accumulation. "So much Christine told me. I observed, when she paused at this point, that I} had not yet been informed how Paul became domes- ticated at Brookhouse; and she replied that the summer previous her father had made one of his geological trips into the region of Paul's home. There he had- found this shy. and melancholy recluse, with books and spec- imens full of interest to him, and an amount 'of loose knowledge which his own electric questions soon brought to light and order. A very slight degree of interest in his favorite pursuits was always sufficient to win the enthusiastic old gentleman's heart. He pitied the isolation of the ' young man,' as he called   ASPENDALE.     .187 him; was flattered perhaps by the idea of unearthing a ' mute, inglorious' Miller, and invited him to Brookhouse. Somewhat to Christine's surprise, the invitation was ac- cepted; and she told me it was touching to see' how the atmosphere of the house had seemed to soothe and brighten their forlorn visitor. He told her once he had never been so happy since his mother died. He was a good reader; and a beautiful penman, and Dhad contrived to make himself so useful to Christine's father, by reading aloud when the latter's eyes were overworked, copying for the press, and doing literary drudgery -generally, that his departure was not thought of. The idea that Icould suffer any incon- venience from his presence here,' said Chris- tine, and; despite herself, a faint tinge of color came into her calm face, ' has never occurred to papa; nor will I myself apprehend it.' "You may suppose that this tale had so- bered me; yet I could by no means share the partial faith expressed in Christine's last   188      ASPENDALE. words. I did apprehend I hardly knew what. To me the cheerful and high-toned household, where our friend's gracious rule made con- stant sunshine, was no less than haunted by this- pale spectre of a man, with his pitiful eyes that deprecated your disfavor like those of some timid animal. He stole so quietly about the house, he spoke so little and that so submissively, that I believe I should some- times have doubted the reality of his separate existence, had he not himself seemed so pain-. fully conscious of it. I knew by instinct when I first saw him, and surely I knew after I had heard his pathetic story, that my feel- ings toward him should have been all kind- ness. Instead, they partook of a kind of wrathful intolerance, and I could not doubt why. I could forgive, a little impatiently, his unmanly shrinking when his eyes met mine. I could not forgive the look with which they dwelt on Christine. "I knew well enough how it had been. All his life he had been, not simply uninterest.   ASPENDALE.   "   189 ing, but oppressive, to his fellow-creatures; his help never required, his presence always irksome, and that morbid shyness which had been half his mysterious bane had made him always sure of it. But this woman had received him with a compassion and courtesy little less than divine, and made -him  an honored guest in her home. The neglect and scorn of the world had been his passport to her gentlest favor. I knew as well as if I had seen it all how she had stimulated his thought, craved his assistance (he stood ready now to perform the most menial office for her), made for him a place in her life. What wonder if he adored her? "For he followed her like a shadow. He would creep into her presence when she sat down with book or work, as an invalid creeps into the sunshine. He even intruded into our confidential interviews, dogging (no other word will express it) our footsteps in the garden walks, or coming upon us -at sudden turns of the leafy lanes about Brookhouse   190      ASPENDALE. with a sickly smile of apology oil hIis beseech- ing face. I could not endure it, and mar- velled at Christine's patience. The thought that a creature who failed so signally of man- hood should approach with ever so distant an admiration a woman peerless as our friend, a woman over whose first and only love the grave had closed ten years before, and who had remained faithful to that amid the suing of some of the noblest men of her time,-this idea, I say, had at first been ludicrous in its incongruity. When it ceased to be that, it remained unnatural and repulsive. "I even chafed at her unvarying kindness of attention to him, and asked myself some- times, and had nearly asked her, whether in her 'vast pity' she were not capable of utterly sacrificing herself to this imperfect being. And then again I was ashamed of having entertained the thought, and also felt sure that so nerveless a creature as Paul would never dare pass the last, fine barrier of Christine's indescribable dignity.   / ASPENDALE.      191 "Meanwhile matters were coming to an earlier crisis than even I anticipated. One day, about a month after my arrival, when Paul had gone as we supposed to the neigh- boring town, and I had letters to write, Chris- tine came to me, and said with a- smiling apology, - 'I am going out for a solitary walk, which I fancy I need. Come up to the sunset hill in about an hour, and we will walk home together.' "So when I had finished my letters, I fol- lowed her, sauntering slowly on, that I might lose nothing of the delicious summer day, and wondering idly, as I went, whether to a creat- ure like Paul there were any thing of mock- ery or reproach in the exuberant life, the consummate beauty, and the glorious and constant activity of the natural world. I heard no murmur of voices as I mounted the wooded slope of the sunset hill, and so came out upon the little open space at its- summit, with its lonesome western view of illimitable forest, and saw with consternation Christine   192      ASPENDALE. standing in the shadow of the trees and Paul at her feet, more, it seemed to me, like a crouching spaniel than a kneeling man. "Indignation flamed up within me, but died into awe as I read the hopeless passion in his face. I was turning hastily away, when I was arrested by the hoarse voice of the suppliant himself. "' Stay!' he said, struggling feebly to his feet. 'It is over now; and you would have known it. You have always been against me, Miss Zoe; but it can make no difference now. Stay! I am going; ' and mechani- cally obeying the motion of his trembling hand, I stood aside, while he passed me softly, and disappeared the way I came. "' Christine,' I exclaimed, ' what is this?' "The tears rushed into her beautiful eyes. "' Poor Paul!' was all her answer. "'He did not dare ask you to marry him?' "She bowed her head. ' He asked me to save his life and reason, and make a man of him.'   ASPENDALE.      198 "'And you said' - "(I told him in the gentlest words I could find, that I could have married but one man on earth.' "' O Christine! ' I cried impatiently, ' I hope you were firm! You can only prolong his suffering by your tenderness. You who, I know, have no womanish weakness about inflicting present pain for future good,- surely you might have been brave enough to probe his heart deeply for once, and so cure him of this mad love.' "' My child,' she answered, 'I have no experience to guide me in a case like this. Such treatment may indeed be best for those who have health of mind and are capable of hope.- But if I had cut this sick and festering soul too deeply, who knows but it would have died at my hands?' "' At least he will now leave this place.' "No,' she answered steadily: 'he will remain. He begged for it as for life, and I could not refuse. And I shall not tell papa.' 13   194      ASPENDALE. "' And how will you bear his haunting presence?' "By thinking that he is less wretched here than he would be away.' "Nothing more passed between us on the subject, and the new order of things at Brook- house continued undisturbed. Even I was touched by the faithfulness with which Paul strove to keep his promise. He no longer hovered about Christine's footsteps, and de- voted himself with a kind of painful assiduity to the offices which he performed for her father, as though he would appeal to these against the dreaded' sentence of banishment. True, as far as I could see him, I read, and so must she, the prayer of his melancholy eyes. I heard it in the monotonous, incon- solable undertone which sounded through all his reading, so like the wailing of the wind. Yet he offered no ground, for complaint. In the midst of all this, I was suddenly sum- moned away from Brookhouse, and did not return till the last week of the ensuing March.   ASPENDALE.      195 To my unspeakable relief, I found the spectre gone; and the moment Christine and I were alone I asked her, noticing the while that she looked worn and pale, when and why he had left. "About a month ago,' she answered, he broke his word, and I must needs keep mine. Yet I no more think- he was voluntarily unfaithful than I believe him capable of crime. The unfortunate sentiment which has taken possession of him burns his pledges to ashes, and must have its way.' "' Has he written to you? ' "She smiled wearily, and, opening a drawer in her work-table, showed me a pack- age of at least twenty letters directed in his faultless hand. 'They are so utterly extravagant,' she said, 'that, affecting as they also are, they would in themselves cure me of all anxiety about him, if he were like other men.  As- it is, I do not know .what to ' think.' " And did your father know?'   196      ASPENDALE. "' It could not be kept from him; and he, of course, enforced Paul's sentence.' "The night after my arrival a southerly storm began, with shrieking wind and floods of rain that swept away the remains of win- ter's accumulated snows, and rendered the road between Brookhouse and the town apparently impassable. I greatly enjoyed this storm, believing that it secured us against Paul's uncanny apparition, which, otherwise, H should have expected every moment. We resumed the habits of the days before his advent. I was reader, and Christine her father's copyist; and, but for a lingering depression which my friend could not quite shake off, we should have been thoroughly cosey and happy. On the even- ing of the third day the rain ceased., and the full moon shone out at intervals between the flying clouds; but the wind still careered through space like a mad thing; the swollen river roared like the sea; and half the country in view from the house had become an eddy-   ASPENDALE.      197 ing lake, which sparkled strangely under the fitful shining of the moon. We were sitting around the parlor fire, - Christine, her father, and I, - when we were all startled by the unexpected sound of footsteps on the veran- da. The old gentleman asked in amaze- ment who could have come on such a night; but I think neither Christine nor I had any doubt. In another moment the door was opened, and Paul entered, pale and dripping, wasted in flesh, wilder than ever in manner, so graceless a travesty of Leander that the association would have been laughable but for our presentiment that this mad lover's steps were waited on by so much darker a tragedy than that old swimmer's of the Hel- lespont. Every thing was done, of course, to restore and make him comfortable. He scarcely replied to the old gentleman's aston- ished questions; but the 'moment he and Christine chanced to be left alone, he cried out that she knew why he had come, that he was dying away'from her. 'And then he said-   198       ASPENDALE. I do not know what he said: I only know his prayer was terrible in its agony of supplica- tion; and she, in her turn, had no choice but to steel her heart, and speak a word which silenced him. "I could not sleep that night for the v thought of him in the house. After midnight, I was sure I heard a step under my window, and started up nervously. There he was, - a ghastly figure in the moonlight, picking his tremulous way among the rivulets and pools, with his face toward the swollen river. In sudden alarm, I opened and shut my window sharply to let him know he was observed; when, starting violently at the noise, he slunk back into the house. I heard him bolt the door cautiously, and come up to his room, which was near mine, where he walked to and fro for hours, murmuring to himself. Perhaps he was in prayer. I am sure I prayed for him,--poor soul!- and longed for the lay. "A cheerless dawn had already succeeded to that strange night, when I fell into a light   ASPENDALE.      199 slumber, from which I was- suddenly wak- ened by the most appalling sound I ever heard. It was something between a moan and a howl distressfully prolonged. ^In a moment, it seemed to me, I was up and has- tily dressed, and had met the whole household in the passage, hurrying toward the place whence the cry had come. It was the hall into which Paul's room opened; and he lay there on the floor unconscious, with livid lips, and fixed, half-open eyes. They lifted him to a couch in the hall, and sent at once for a phy- sician; and, in the seemingly interminable hours which passed before he could arrive over the flooded roads, we used every effort to restore Paul to consciousness, but without success. At last the doctor came, examined the patient, and shocked us all by his unhesi- tating verdict:- "'The attack was of an alarming, ip fact fatal, nature. Intense mental excitement must have been its immediate cause. He might, and probably would, regain conscious-   200      ASPENDALE. ness, but recovery was inipossible. Had he any relatives? He (the doctor) found the patient exceedingly enfeebled; and, though it was possible for him to continue a week or two, he was not likely to survive as many days. Let him be kept perfectly quiet. He would call again to-morrow.' "We telegraphed to his father, and Paul continued in the same lethargic state until after the physician's second visit. Christine watched him constantly, but liked to have me also in the room; and so it happened that I was there when, on the afternoon of the following day, he came to himself. I saw him open his eyes, fix them on her with such a clear, calm look as I had never seen in them before, and whisper, 'Chris-   i tine.' "She went close to him, and while he still held her with that fond but wholly new look, yet did not speak again, she told him gently that he had been very ill. "' I know it,' he answered, smiling: ' I have   ASPENDALE.      201 been ill a long time. Has the doctor seen me?  "'He has just left, Paul.' "' What did he say? ' "She hesitated but a moment; then, assured by the deep composure of his look, she told him all, - not without tears. "He heard her attentively, and without the slightest agitation, and pressed her hand when she- had done. ' So life is over!' he said, as if to himself; and then lay and seemed to be thinking, but with a face that grew every moment more serene. "' Do not think too much, dear friend,' she said anxiously. "He shook his head slightly, - so strange to see him  the self-possessed one! --and answered, I It will do no harm. They are tranquil thoughts,--almost happy. So life is over i- and this, I suppose, is the " brighten- ing weather" that sometimes comes before the end.' "She did not quite understand him, for he,   202      ASPENDALE.         * spoke very feebly; and as she bent lower, he repeated, "The brightening weather." - That was in one of your favorite poems, Christine: "The hurricane is past, And the good boat speeds through the brightening weather."' "' I remember it,' she answered, much affected. "He said again, after a pause, as though still meditating on his reprieve from life, 'I did not think I could have come so quickly and easily to the end. Not,' he added, with a very sweet smile, ' that I would speak ill of life since I have known you in it, Christine; but I only wearied you, and it is better as it is. It is well. I am glad to have lived. I am thankful. I am'- he paused a moment, and then added, with deep solemnity- ' hopeful.' "'I knew it must one day be so,' she answered, gently. -", Not,' he continued, with a trace of his old anxious conscientiousness, 'that all is   ASPENDALE..      203 clear that way: I shall not die in full assur- ance, as my dear mother did. But the altered look of this life quiets me about the other. I shall see my mother: I shall see you again, Christine.' "He said the same in substance many times during the next day or two, his only anxiety seeming to be lest we should not understand his reconcilement with the old life, or think he claimed too much in the new. He left affectionate messages for his father and sis- ters, who had, thus far, failed to arrive, and after that seemed but to wait. On the third day after his return to consciousness he was very restless, and wanted. to sit up. They lifted him, therefore, into an easy-chair near the window; where he- sat,--a transparent figure in the sweet spring sunshine, --gazing wistfully out upon the awakening earth, until Christine, who had been called away for a little while, returned, when he started at the sight of her, half rose, stretched out his arms, and dropped at her feet, dead."   204      ASPENDALE. "His relatives arrived in time to take his remains and convey them for burial to the country church-yard where his mother lay. That mother, at rest so long, had never seen a-peacefuller look on the features of her sleeping baby, before the mysterious sorrows of his life began, than we, when we 'looked upon it last. I have seldom seen a nobler human face than his in death. The truly intellectual proportions of the brow seemed now, for the first time, revealed. The restless quivering of the lower features had settled into a firm repose; and the aspect of the whole was passionless and majestic. Death seemed to have left that look upon his face to assure us, if there were need, that the departed soul, freed from the hard shackles of its earthly existence, had somewhere en- tered upon the 'liberty of the children of God.' -Did Death delude us?"

"So," he continued, "I have helped you slightly. And for the rest," he added, in his ordinary tone, " do not forget that it is a mark of weakness, not of strength, to fix the eye too earnestly on any morbid aspect of nature or of life."   * 1 TnPHUS the spell of that first winter was broken for the half-disciplined novice, and Sally's pungent herb-drink made 'one more stain upon the wasting snow. The weeks which followed resounded with career- ing wind. Short, spiteful tempests came and went. Universal unrest in the out-of-door world replaced the swoon-like stillness of January. Until there came a dark, mild night, when the brook gurgled loudly and the frogs tuned in the lowlands and on the mor- row our friends awoke to find the winter joined unto departed time, the purple morn- ing' full of bird-songs, and overhead and underfoot the sailing clouds and steaming fields of April. Of course the spring loitered, but neither Christinwe nor Zoe cared to hasten it; for   208      ASPENDALE. Ruby was to leave her home in May. The decision was a sudden one, dependent on the unexpected resolution of her Jianc6 to manke the first trial of his science and his address in a showy western city. "Let 'em go!" cried the Doctor, stoutly, when he informed our ladies of the plan. In his heart, he had always hoped that his son- in-law would inherit his own practice, and Ruby remain mistress of the village home. *'Let 'em go'- The girl has seen nothing of the world. She's healthy; and knock- ing about will give her new ideas, and never hurt her. And there's nothing like that westernihfe, where all begin alike, for taking the conceit out of a- Bless me! I didn't say that!" "Poor old man!" said Christine, as they discussed the tidings over their quaint tea- cups. "Selfish young man!" returned Zoe. "That's it!" cried Sally, who had been building a fire on the hearth to dispel the   ASPENDALE.      209 evening dampness, and who now rose and emphasized her testimony with a knotty fore- finger. "I've got eyes,: and I don't like him." "You're not logical there, Sally," observed Zoe. "This youth is very charming to the eye." "Fiddlesticks!l quoth the model domestic. "I know him. Comes over here, and looks in at the kitchen door and says, -( You don't get married yet, Sally,' says he. Impudence! I won't humor him enough to tell him I know too much! .Oh, yes! Who so fine"as my lord? But he's a bad sort for a- husband, - bless the girl! Didn't I stay there three months the summer afore you come back, Miss, and don't I know? -JEIain't I seen him lollin' in the Doctor's own chair, and turnin' down the leaves of his best books, and laugh- ing at the sermons that made the Doctor cry? Specks like them spread till they spile a whole man! I had it on my tongue's end a hundred times to tell Miss Ruby she'd a deal better, have the minister!"' n ,  14   210      ASPENDALE. "Ignatius?" said Zoe, when Sally had left them. "He will miss Ruby sadly, - so shall we all; but will he do more? Have you ever feared it?" "Not seriously. He is too sensible, too single-minded; has known her promised to another too long. Or if--dear soul!--he has his little pang, it will pass away; for the wounds of the healthful spirit, like those of the healthful body, heal rapidly and leave no scar. He loses the savor of youth out of his life, and so do we." "The savor of youth and the last dash of vivid color.- Well!" And after a pause Zoe added, "While I can make allowance for the element of personal antipathy in Sally's strictures, and for the ' affront to her injured beauty,' I cannot help sharing her fears to some extent. A man may not be to blame for lacking heart, but the fault is con- spicuous in a bridegroom." "A little discipline will do Ruby no harm."   ASPENDALE.      2" "Do not say so! Never hint that our brilliant Ruby can become one of t ose dis- ciplined wives who die at thirty with a character for angelic patience, and whose solemn obituaries read so sadly and strangely to those who only remember the fire and frolic of their girlhood." "My dear, you are too tragic. Ruby will not die easily, nor do I despair of her future lord. Her high spirit and habits of authority may be infinitely wholesome to him. And at all events, since in this fallen world faulty beings must marry, let us ponder over the. trousseau and sing at the wedding, and not beckon to the coming shadows." They saw much of Ruby during the month that followed, and had never loved her better. The shade of her approaching farewell to father, home, and girlhood, added an inde- scribable softness to her old gay, charm. They thought each fresh suit of dainty ap. parel became her dark, sweet beauty better than the last.   212      ASPENDALE. "The rose-light deepens before departing," said Christine, with a little sigh. The night before the wedding, for Which an early hour had been appointed, Christine was to spend at the Doctor's. Zoe had been busy all the afternoon arranging the profusion of spring flowers which, overruling the bride- groom's dissenting voice, the ladies had voted for decoration,--vases of frail anemones, baskets of violets, towers of nodding colum- bine. The sun was going down beauteously behind the ' misty green' of the garden trees, when she bade her friends good-night, prom- ising to come early and help dress the bride. Alcibiades walked with her to Aspendale, and never had that heartless Athtenian proved himself a more agreeable escort. She was meaning to tell Sally so, and to enliven her lonely evening by taxing that independ- ent functionary with her lack of Christian charity, when, as they drew near the farm, she was startled by the apparition of the old woman herself standing bare-headed at the   ASPENDALE. /    213 garden gate, the light wind lifting her short, gray hair, her whole attitude expressive of the most earnest anxiety for her own arrival. Embarrassment was added to Zoe's surprise, when Sally, catching sight of her, began executing a wild pantomime to the effect that her companion was on no account to enter the hoyse. Luckily the bridegroom did not care to tarry; and in a moment more Zoe had bidden him a hasty good-night, and was hurrying toward the old servant with the peremptory inquiry, - "Sally, what ails you?" "He ain't a comin' back, is he?" "Of course not!" "Nor she a comin' home-?" "Christine? Certainly not. W hy do you behave so? What has happened?  Have we been robbed?' "No," answered the old woman, with an agitation not unmnixed with solemnity; ," but something has happened, and I must tell you. Come with me."   And she led the amazed   214      ASPENDALE. Zoe into the clean and silent kitchen, where the May moon was already shining. "Sit down," she said. "There's been a man here to see Miss." "A friend of hers?" "No, nobody she ever saw. It was the man that keeps the poor-house in"----; and-she named a neighboring town. "In heaven's name what did he want with her?" "There came a woman to his place two days ago,- a woman with a boy.    She seemed to be most gone in a consumption, and ain't sot up since. She had travelled the Lord knows how many miles to find our  Miss. She went to Brookhouse first, not knowin' o' the changes, and then come on this way, but couldn't get no farther than the place I named. Mebbe she never will. The father of the boy was Miss' brother." "How do you know?" "I ain't no kind o' doubt of it. I shouldn't wonder if there was more on 'em. The man   ASPENDALE.      215 was in an awful hurry, and wouldn't take time to go on to the village. He had missed his way coming over the hills, and had got to get back, thirty miles, to-night. But I've got some letters and things that the woman give him to give Miss, and I know the writin'. And he told me what he knew. She was a poor girl, but good-lookin' and high-strung. She hadn't any folks of her own to speak on', and she was too proud to go to his. Besides -poor creetur I - her boy is'seven years old. His father died a month before he was born." X "Christine will bring him here!" "I expect she will, and I s'pose she'd ought to. He's a pretty boy the man says, and as bright as a dollar. . I'd like to see one o' the name that wasn't, whatever his mother may have been. But you must tell Miss." "I will, but not until the wedding is over," "Mebbe you're right there," said Sally, with unwonted meekness.   216      ASPENDALE. It was the fairest of May mornings. The many-tinted loveliness of the land,-- rosy- gray of budding oaks, deep red of maple flowers, pale green flame of willows along the water-courses,- the delicious light, the abundant song, appealed to Zoe's senses with strange power, in their contrast with the sorrowful secret she was keeping; and as she decked the rosy bride, she thought of the dying mother over there beyond the hills, and owned with sad humility the solemn intricacy of life. Christine saw that she was absent and depressed, and marvelled. Once she even ventured to suggest a change in the disposi- tion of the bridal flowers. "You do it, dear," said Zoe, gently letting drop the snowy spray. "No!" cried Alcibiades, springing forward, always the connoisseur. "Do not touch it! It is perfect as it is." "It reminds one of the 'law of indirect effort,'" observed Ruby, with her old sparkle;   ASPENDALE.      217 but dashing away a tear with her white gloves. And the two complacent school-friends who were to officiate as Ruby's bridesmaids laughed without knowing why. Then they moved into the fragrant parlor where the company were assembled, -a few city guests and many country friends. Igna- tius was there already, and Aristocles; the latter testifying a paternal pride at the vision of Zoe in her lavender robes, which would have pleased her deeply another time, but which she hardly noticed now. Dreamily she  observed the simple cere- mony,-the prayers, the greetings, the Doc- tor's determined hilarity, the singular grace of the wedded pair, the feasting and farewells. Christine was unusually bright through all. '"We have wasted our pity on the little priest," she once whispered to Zoe. "Just now he came   up to Aristocles, who was standing by me, and I  fancied he looked troubled and pale; but what do you think he   218      ASPENDALE. said?- I hear nothing from my Grote's Plato; and it should have been here by the last steamer!'" But when the village-guests had gone, and the friends were alone in Ruby's deserted chamber, Zoe told her story. It was a great shock, but Christine's resolution was instantly taken. She left town that afternoon, refusing Zoe's company; and on the morrow sent for Ignatius. On the fifth day she returned, and with her there came a slender, agile, inquisi- tive child. The mother was dead. The native ease of the boy's bearing, the sweetness of his voice, the apt intelligence of his lightest look and question, were so many poignant reminders of one whose gifts had all been perverted, whose every personal grace had wrought for the ruin of others and his own. He took kindly, if a little coolly, the tenderness of his new friends. He adopt- ed, without comment, the refinements to which they introduced him; but there was an eerie look in his bright eye at times; he dis-   ASPENDALE.      219 played now and then a causeless wayward- ness, an unchildlike reticence, which showed how slow might be the task of winning his love, how hard that of guiding his will. In this startling manner was the element of youth restored to the lives of our friends. It came fraught with anxiety and almost with reproach, showing how vainly they had  thought to sever themselves wholly, in their quiet valley, from the sin and sorrow of the great world without. But it brought interest also, and that intense; a deepened sense of responsibility, and livelier alternations of hope and fear. And the life they lived thenceforth was richer, if less tranquil, than that of which they had dreamed. Cambridge: Press of John Wilson & Son.   I I j    GEORGE SAND'S NOVELS. MAUPRAT .        . ...      ......      I .50 ANTONIA     .......         .....      1.50 frrom the Cleveland Leader. Miss Vaughan has shown herself to be perfectly adapted to the work she has undertaken. We search in vain through -the entire list of translations, from the French published in this country and England, for a volume which more satisfac- torily reveals one's remembrance of it in the original, than the one now under- consideration. Antonia is not one of the great works of its authoress, the best of whose fiction is to our mind the most consummate romance that France has yet produced; but is by far the most elaborate and perfect in its finish. . . . The scene is principally m Paris, the Paris of Louis XVI., and the action occurs just prior to the. French Revolution. The hero is a poor unknown artist, the heroine a countess, beautiful and exalted in station, but, withal, a woman of the purest type. The beautiful garden which encloses the home of the heroine is exquisitely painted, and in those enchanted shadows there is portrayed the birth and development of a love as passionate and pure as ever was pictured in romance. ... Uncle Antoine, the marplot of the story, is strongly and admirably drawn; and the Countess and Julien Thierry are two of the most perfect lovers in any literature. The tale derives its name from that of a rare and perfect flower, cultivated by Uncle Antoine in the enchanted garden, and whose growth and blossoming are woven with exquisite art into the development of the story. John G. Saxe, in Albany Evening youmarnat. Undoubtedly the woman who by her writings has exerted the widest, probably the most potent, influence upon the men and women of her time, is she who, under the nom, de fiunme of "George Sand," has given to the world in her own sparkling French tongue, and, through translations, in almost every modern language which has a literature, such powerful and fascinating works as "Mauprat," "Antonia," and a host of other works, the very names of which suggest by their number a fertility and industry almost as remarkable as the extraordinary genius which inspired them. For many years no writer was so little understood, or rather, so thoroughly misuhderstood, both in England and America. Not unnaturally, the immorality, the flippancy, the persifage, of most contemporary novelists of France, were attributed to the writings of Madame Dudevant by people who had read nothing, or only the'earliest and most objectionable, of her novels. For a time. therefore, she was any thin but popular, and presently fell into neglect. Novel readers who sought only for the sensational, indifferent to the moral quality of their intellectual pabulum, were disappointed in finding instruction and the noblest philosophy where they looked hopefully for pruriency or romantic excitement; while the higiher class of readers were warned away by hearing, in endless repetition, the charge of eccentricity in her life. and dangerous morality in her books. Even prejudice has commonly some foundation, and it is not to be denied that both in her earlier life and literature there is much to reprehend; much, indeed, that she has lived herself to condemn, and, as far as might be, to counteract. What all but a few failed to learn was the sincerity. the benevolence, the deep philanthropy, of this wonderful woman, who, with such sad and disheartening experiences of life, lost no faith in God or mankind, and who, with such fervor of language and elo- quence' of diction as no French woman had ever before employed, still kept to her work of trying to make the world happier and better by inculcating in the more vrainemsble and fascinating pictures the noblest lessons of hope, courage, 'purity, and practical benevolence. The foregoing remarks were suggested by the excellent edition of the best of the novels of George Sand, remarkably well translated into English, which is now appearing from the press of Roberts Brothers, Boston. "Mauprat " and "Antonia " have already appeared, and others, carefully selected, will presently follow. We have just concluded the perusal of the latter, a charming love story, which we have found no less attractive than t"Mauprat;" and so com- mend it to the public.   MARGARET.  By  SYVESTER   JUDD.    One volume.    Price $1i.50 SELECTIONS FROM SOME NOTABLE REVIEWS. Fromt the Southern Quarterly Review. "This book, more than any other that we have read, leads us to believe in the possibility of a distinctive American Literature.... It bears the impress of New England ppon all its features. It will be called the Yankee novel, and rightly; for nowhere else have we seen the thought, dialect, and customs of a New England Village, so well and faithfully represented.... More significant to our mind than any book that has yet appeared in our country. To us it seems to be a prophecy of the future. It contemplates the tendencies of American life and character. Nowhere else have we seen, so well written out, the very feelings which our rivers and woods and mountains are calculated to awaken. ... We predict the time when Margaret will be one of the Antiquary's text-books. It contains a whole magazine of curious relics and habits. . . . as a record of great ideas and pure sentiments, we place it among the few great books of the age." From the NortZ A merican Review. "We know not where any could go to find more exact and pleasing descriptions of the scenery of New England, or of the vegetable and animal forms which give it life.... As a representation of manners as they were, and in many respects are still, in New England, this book is of great value." From the London Athencum.    . "This book, though published some time since in America, has only recently become known here by a few stray copies that have found their way over. Its leading idea is so well worked out, that, with all its faults of detail, it strikes us as deserving a wider circulation. ... The book bears the impress of a new country, and is full of rough, uncivilized, but vigorous life. The leading idea which it seems intended to expound is, that the surest way to degrade men is to make themselves degraded; that so long as that belief does not poison the sources of experience, 'all th/ins'--even the sins, follies, mistakes, so rife among men--can be made to work together for good.' This doctrine, startling as it may sound at first, is wrought out with a fine knowledge of human nature." From the A nti-$lavery Standard. "A remarkable book, with much good common sense in'it, full of deep thought, pervaded throughout with strong religious feeling, a full conception of the essence of Christianity, a tender compassion for the present condition of man, and an abiding hope through love of what his destiny may be. .... But all who, like Margaret, ' dream dreams,' and 'see visions,' and look for that time to come when man shall have 'worked out his own salvation,' and peace shall reign on earth, and good-will to men, will, if they can pardon the faults of the book for its merit, read it with acidity and pleasure." From the Boston Daily Advertiser. This is quite a remarkable book, reminding you of Southey's I Doctor,' per- haps, more than of any other book.... Margaret is a most angelic being, who loves everybody and whom everybody loves, and whose sweet influence is felt wherever she appears. She has visions of ideal beauty, and her waking eyes see beauty and joy in every thing." Frown ths. Christian Register. "This is a remarkable book. Its scene is laid in New England, and its period some half century ago. Its materials are drawn from the most familiar elements of every-day life. Its merits are so peculiar, and there is so much that is origina and rich in its contents, that, sooner or later, it will be appreciated. It is impossi- ble to predict with assurance the fate of a book, but we shall be much mistaken if Margaret does not in due season work its way to a. degree of admiration seldom attained by a work of its class."

"Miss Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living writers for children, and ' Mopsa ' alone ought to give her a kind of pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks. It requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has, and the story of Jack is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a picture of childhood. "' The young people should be grateful to Jean Ingelow and those other noble writers, who, in our day, have taken upon themselves the task of supplying them with literature, if for no other reason, that these writers have saved them from the ineffable didacticism which, till within the last few years, was considered the only food fit for the youthful mind." - Eclectic.
