p
This book may be regarded as one of the varieties of the day. It is difficult to
canceive, while perusing these Lamnbleswtere adventures so excititig and thrilling
are so forcibly told, that it is a true and veritable narrative; but such,we assure the
reader is the fact. The natural scenery in that sunny region is painted in the glow.
ing tints of a faithfut picture. The character of that singular people, the Arauenni.
ans; the lofty and magnanimous bearing of their warriors; the lovely. confiding,
and affectionate dispositions of the rimaidenus, arc all beautifully delineated; and so
vididly are the various scenes portrayed, that we s een to be transported to the field
where they are etacte.l, and feel; the varied emotions of the actors. If some of
these adventures and incidents, were related in a romance, the leader would prob.
ably say they were exaggerated, so much mre strange is truth than fiction.

ADVERTISEMENT.
The following Narrative was originally written without the least idea of publi-
cation, for the Author's own amusement-a mere whim of the hour, "to perpetu-
ate the remembrance of the thing," while it was fresh upon his mind; and ,to
drive away ennui while a sailor on board the Chilian Brig of War "Achilles."
At the solicitation of a few friends, it has recently been re-written in portions
each week for the "Lincoln Miscellany." The task has been performed at such
intervals as-the writer could spare fr'rm his daily labors, when his mind was har-
assed with business matters :--le was, therefore, no less surprised than gratified,
at the the indulgence and favor with which his hasty production was received
during the course otf its pub ication in the "Miscellany." These pages have been
printed in signatures weekly, just as they appeared in the paper, and if they are
faulty. so be it.; the reader must supply the corrections, he being the only one who
has had an opportunity to do so.
These remarks are not presented to excuse errors, or avert criticism ; the writer
is aware that he must bear the blame of the former, let him be guilty or not guil-
ty; and he is quite willing to "bide the pelting storm" of the latter; his sole ob-
ject having been-without any attempt at author-craft-to furnish those who re-
quested, and others who may choose to read these "Rambles," a "plain, unvar-
nished tale" of a sailor's adventures.


OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
"7 The Lincoln (Thomaston, Me,) Miscellany is Publishing an original and
highly interesting work entitled "Rambles in Chili,and hfe among the Araucanian
Indians," by an annonyrnous author. * *  *  We can heartly pronounce it a
work of rare merit. It combines richness of description, with thrilling incidents
and marvellous adventures; and abounds in well painted delineations of manners
and customs, useful observations of society, and accurate geographical history.
The unobtrusive interblendingof a racy humor with the general flow of the narra-
tive, will give it a popularity but little inferior to "Melville's Typee." The Aran.
canians are an independent race of Indians, inhabiting the southern part of Chili,
whom the Spaniards have never yet conquered ; and any account ot them cannot
fail of being highly interesting. The work is likely to be widely read.
[Norfolk County Journal
It is put forward as an authentic narrative, and many of the scenes appear too
natural and life like to be an invention of the author. The very minuteness and
novelty of the details-preserve it from the charge of being an imaginary work.
It is, however, a striking proof of the fact that truth is stranger than fiction, being
full of stirring adventures, vivid scenes. and hair breadth escapes.
The writer has given a very spirited deseiption' of the country through which
he fravelled, and his pen has lent to some of the scenes and things portrayed an
indescribable charm. He appears desirous to remain incognito, and uses a ficti-
tious cognomen. Upon the whole it is a book well worth reading, which in this
age of literary inundation, is saving uch in its favor.  [Weekly Mirror.
It is a highly entertaining and instructive tale, giving a true and humorous de.
lineation of the manners and custants of the Chilians ; a correct description of
the scenery in and about the cities of Valparaiso and Talcahuano ; with a novel
and interesting account of a three months sojourn 4rnong a nation of Idians, to.
tally ignorant of any previous intercourse with white men.
It opens with a sketch of sea life. The principal part of the work, however,
is a true narrative of an actttl journey through the count'rv, by two fugitive sail-
ors ; and the story of their adventures, reckless daring, and hair breadth escapes
is another proof that "truth is stranger than fiction."  Although with little pre'
tension to author-craft, the narrative is embellished with some of the most excit-
ing and romantic scenes imaginable, and again with others the most comical. It
is full of marvellous adventures, perilous journeyings, and glowing pictures of sce-
nery and luxuriant nature.                               [Miscellany.
We have heard many commendations of it, as abounding in variety of incidents,
d natural and lively description.                [Lime Rock Gazette.

In this instance the officer is on the alert
He has been promenading the starboard
side of the quarter deck, looking first on
one side, then on the other, or occasional-
ly wetting his finger with his mouth, and
holding it up to ascertain if any air is stir-
ing, until he finally 'imagines a slight
agitation of the atmospheric particles.
Convincing himself of this fact, he gives
the helmsman a poke which disturbs his,
reverie, and callfhim back to his post, or
rather to his tiller.
"Haul in your starboard' braces!" he
calls out to the men, who jump up al-
most bewildered at first, but quickly re-
covering themselves, the yards are braced
up and the fore-tack boused well out to
the eat-head.

I informed him that I had put some

that it would answer for some time yet.
"Keep her off then, two points.
Steady!" says he. "Let her go along

we will put the muslin on her,' said the
officer joyfully, as he walked forward to
see his orders executed.

been appointed Capt. of the Port..

To the eastward of the Head, and along

of -others, are seen, scattered along the
shore.- The town contained at the time
of which I write,tabout one hundred
houses, a church, and'custom house, with
groceries and pulperies,, in abundance,
and the ruins of a number of buildings,
thrown down in the severe earthquake
which happened the year previous, in the

"Among the ruins, were the crumbling

Take our politicians and public men
generally, and it Will be ,;fou-nd they are
ilze:wost craven, dastardly wretches in ex-
istence. Look for instance 4 the drivel-
ling imbecile, who bore the title of Mayor
of New York, and presided over the out..
rageoum and co hardly massacre at the
4stpy-place opera house, on the;night ,of
the tenth of' May, 1849; merely to pam
per the vanity and sooth the wounded
pridetsa - score of -cowardlyaristocriati-
cal nabobe; ordering the murderous fire
instead of yielding to the wishes of a disc
gus e4 ;and justly iidignant people, by
closing thecontemptible show shop. What
A lack of filmnss and independence was
hg4iglayd, At the bid of a few bol-
l9.  h.aated gristocrats, to order ade=
-fencelessand iannoce nt multitude to he}
slaughtered, in the vain hope that a want
during mountebank vagabond would be
permitted to make a harlequin of him-
self, and abuse American citizens. What
makes the butchery still more melancholy,
is the fact, that the least worthy of the
fifty murdered persons, was worth more
to society, than a whole nationof such as
encouraged and rejoiced in the massa-,
cre.
There are other public functionaries
that have proved themselves as craven in
their acts, as' has Mayor Woodhull; but
few deeds however, have been followed
by such dangerous results. A war of
classes has been induced in that city,
which, if not quieted, will one day result
in utter ruin to the present lordly tyrants

Our course led us on through the same
interminable forest, where hoary old trees,
the growth and decay of centuries, lay
prostrated and scattered along the rough
path, a track which seemed marked out
by the wild animals that frequented
these solitary wilds, rather than by the
art of man. We passed on, mile after
mile, up hill anddown valley,;and leaping
the swift-running water course,noWclimb-
ing over fallen trees, which lay at almost
every angle, then hurrying down some
.steep declivity, and emerging at the bot.

It was, I think, the fourth day of our
journey that we arrived at quite a flour.
ishing little village-in fact it was more
entitled to the name than any other on the
route. We were accosted a short dis-
tance out of the village by a man on
horse-back. He appeared to be much
pleased, saluting us with true Castilian
politeness, and inviting us to pass the
night with him at his house in the vil-
lage. " Entres mi casa paisanos, tomar
siesta, si todas a noches, muchos hay pon-
chos," cried he with a bow. Si Signor
con mucha gusta, mil gracias," replied
Harry, as he gladly accepted the invita-
tion.
We were kindly welcomed by the farn-
ily of the proprietor, and treated to some
fine flavored native wine.  Nearly all
the huts of the village were built of reeds
plastered with mud, and thatched with
straw. Few of them .contained more
than one room, and those generallyrWith.

here we were tully initiated into the man-

The females in general, are robust and
healthy; owing in a great nepasure to their
diet of coarse bread and fruit. They 'are
extremely fond of dancing, and- seer, to

we ventured to try our success once
more. We were however, uncerimoni"
ously repulsed ; they turned loose upon
us two large dogs, from which we were
glad to make a hasty retreat, after having
been handled by them in no ceremoni-
cus manner.
From all these symptoms we judged
that our lot had been cast amongst a bar.
barous people ; every traveller who had
passed us of late. had whipped up his
horse, refusing all communication with
us. After halfan hour's further progress
we found that we were nearing a village,
and remembering the treatment we had
already received front the neighboring
villages and hamlets, we naturally hesi-
tated to venture among the inhabitants of
the village before us, fearing even worse
results might occur, 'from such a proceed-

still, save the distant sound of the patter-

A   zgi Mthe distance would Gome their
deeprumbling sound, as of some mighty
tor arch of the wood torn from his bed
by the sweeping night blast, and hurled
thundering to the ground. And then tlje
sounds died away among the trees;
again the furious wind and rain alone
swept by, the bitter blast howled on, and
th. ominous wispering of spirits rose and
fell.
Willis has said that the sound of the
dropping rain is musical and soothing to
th,,ear.. It may have uttered melodious
s nds to his poetic ear, while snugly
sandwitched between two woolen sheets
iii his garret bed; but had he made his
solitary mid-night bed with us, in the
miasmatic bogs of Chili, during that dis-
vnal stormy night,: it would 'have struck
1ess soothingly on his ear.
At last we counted through the long
l hours of that strange and sleepless
fight, and the gray gloomy dawn came
struggling through our leafy casement.
At the first peep of day we arose from
our disagreeable couch, completely satu-
rated with the rain and stiffened with the
cold, looking life a mere vapid dilution of
our former selves. We rubbed ourbenumb-
ed limbs, and performed numerous calis-
thenic. exercises to restore the nearly
suspended circulation. Our drenching
hadsuperseded the necessity of the usual
morning ablutions, and without any fur-
ther cold water applications, we continued
all' dripping; on our weary march, the
storm having settled into a cold and driz-
zly rain. Sadly and silently we picked

our forlorn way onward, wading streams,
climbing slippery precipices and stumi.
ling over rocks arid underbrush.
It cleared off about noon, and the smil.
ing sun burst upon us, cheering our droop.
ing spirits, and stirring the blood again,
gladly through our veins, after it had
been so long shrunk away from the sur-
face, to escape the chilling touch of the
night blast. We removed our wet
clothes, and hung them to dry in the sun
while we reposed under the shade of the
wide speading trees.
Our situation among a race of people
as ignorant and wild almost as the un-
tamed savage, was gloomy and unenvia-
ble to the most romantic mind, and I
mentally admitted  that "happy is he
who neVer saw the smoke of a strangers
fire."
Having clothed ourselves and gather-
ed a few berries and other fruit which
we found in the vicinity, to eat on our
way, we cut two stout walking sticks,
and trudged on, hoping soon to again'
discover the path from which, we had
wandered the previous night. About' 5
o'clock we found ourselves ascending a
long sloping hill, its waving and undula-.
ted surface abounding with thick clusters
of a thorny minosa ; upon reaching the
suinit the view that burst upon us was
grand and beautiful. A world of, forest
lay spread out before us, 'with many a

On nearing the mountains we found
them to be a long continuous ridge, tow-
ering far into the clouds, and crossing
our course at right angles. They seemed
indeed to form an impenetrable barrier
to our farther progress, unless we could
'discver some ravine or gap through
which we might pass. Having travelled
along the foot of the ridge, for two or
bree' hours, without finding any pass
through which we could reach the oppo-
site side, we came to the conclusion to
cl mberup the side of the mountain and
sale its heights at the most favorable
place which presented.
We accordingly began our ascent at
the lowest point, where the ridge appear-
ed not more than seven or eight hundred
feet in height; the sequel however,
proved that it must have been mnch
more.
Near the base of the mountain the an-
gle was not more than 25or 30 0, and the
ground plentifully covered with low shrub-
bery, our progress for the first hour was

comparatively easy. From this time we
found our way becoming more steep

pear, the soil was loose and broken, and
our footing was painfully insecure. - The
earth and gravel crumbled away beneath
us at almost every step, and the larger
stones went leaping and plunging into
the vale below, still with our eyes fixed to-
wards the summit, we boldly pushed on,
until obliged to rest from mere exhaustion
and fatigue.
On looking into the bosom of the val-
ley below us, we were fully aware how
steep and dangerous had been our course,
and how much more formidable it ap-
peared to us now, than while toiling up
the ascent. But when we. turned and
gazed at the prospect above us, we were
almost discouraged, upon observing that
scarcely one third of our task had been
accomplished, and the remainder of the
ascent appeared fearfully steep.-

and overhanging crags, seemed to threat-

ficent panorama, as though we feared the
kast movement might dissolve the spell
and break the enchantment; so supernat-

den and full of unimaginable beauty, so
nvishingly delightful were the splendors
which shot before us !

The mountain sloped off on the west
with i~ gradual desceit into the valley

below; down this declivity we started on
the run, and bounding forward with in-
credible rapidity we soon reached the
valley, which on all sides presented a
fetile appearance, and our hunger now
prompted us to seek the where-with-all to
satisfy its cravings.
We diligently searched about for those
green berries which had heretofore( so
much contributed to- our support. We
discovered several different kinds but as
we were totaly unacquainted with their
properties we feared to eat them, and
were forced to satisfy our present wants
by chewing the bark of several trees
which we knew from previous use were
not poisonous.
We wandered along without keeping
any regular course until late in the
afternoon when crossing one of theasmall
streams that intersected the ground, we
came suddenly upon what appeared to
be a foot path indistinctly traced among
the grass and roots, and leading up the
stream a short distance, when it turned,
diverging at right angles from the water.
We immediately struck into this path,
and rapidly hurried along, feeling confi-
dent it woul conduct us to some human
abode. Our first conjectures were soon'

to be a piece of the fruit containing th'

that it was a female form. As I turned

least objectionable, or repugnant to my
feelings, and of course I returned them
with interest. She hurried me to the
door of the hut where she stood gazing
me full in the face, repeating several
times 'Vilando! Vilando! usted Livinia' I
caught up the name 'Livinia' and repeat
ted it with accents of joy while she threw
herself wildly in my arms smothering me
with her affectionate  caresses. "Mi

of bliss. In the mean time all I could
do was to repeat over what I had now
ascertained to be her name and endeavor
as far as in me lay, to return a portion of
her loving caresses, not wishing to be out-
done by a lady in such matters-

through the trees, containing some eighz
ty or ninety houses, and half as many
more in the outskirts.
Every thing looked lovely around us
as we entered this little villiage. The
mornirg was now in its freshness,. the
path was skirted by numerous flowers
and shrubs of tender and graceful foliage;
emerald winged parrots, skiped about
among the trees, or whistled shrill and
clear from the thatched roof. All along
the banks of the river that swept silently
through th'e village, were seen rich and
luxuriant fruit trees, interlacing theik
boughs ; some standing at the very edge
of the bank, bending their gracefull bran-
ches into the water.
Their buildings were the usual frail
reed structures, that one would hardly
.suppose able to keep out the winter winds
as mild and temperate as they are,
Within they were if possible less cheer
ful. Each house could boast of but'lon
room only, which served in all the capac-
ities of kitchen, parlor and bedrooni. IY
each angle were placed the rustic ben-
ches, for the couch, and occupied as a
lounge by day, and a bed Jby night. The
fire was built among a few loose stones'
in the centre of the room, the smoke esca-
ping, sometimes through an aperture pur.'
posely left in the roof, and again as bed
it could through the numerous acci4eilat
rents and loop holes ; a few scattered
blocks served for moveable seats, but,
the ground itself was more frequently
used.
A flock of eager spectators followed s"
along while Harry and our guide, ue4

that could possibly be, concieved6 It

although quite a different looking person
than formerly, and could speak but very
little spanish, all of which, he explained
to her entire satisfaction. I endeavored
to confirm the impression, by striving to
be as affectionate as a fond and confiding
husband should be.

firmly to the story of the metempsychosis,
well knowing that her good ,graces were
desirable to secure our kind reception,
and if perchance her husband should re-
turn to get out of the scrape the best way

We returned into the hut and having
renewed our fire sat down and continued
our conversation until morning- The col-

engage in, much to my credit, and conse-
quently was obliged to go through my

did with such gusto as to fairly astonish,

tection, and unceasing admiration of my

appeared to me one complete Babel
However, they explained the matter ac
agreed upon, which I soon discovered, by
the strange and curious glances that were
directed towards ne, and the misteriou
handling of my person by some of the
bold ones among the crowd. The parent.
of Livinia readily received me as themi
son-in-law, and I was at once domiciliated
as Lord of the castle inthe old hut where
we had taken up our night's quarters.

nity actually believed in the story we
'had fabricated, but not being able to
contradict it or disprove the story, they
let it pass, all for 'good gold.'  e en-
deavored by every means in our power
to gain the good will of the villagers,
and were successful to an extraordinary
degree. In a few days we were treated
and feasted to our hearts content. "Livi-
ia I found to be a lively companion, a
little given to coqueting with the roystering
blades of the village, but posessed of a
kind and generous heart, and otherwise
sufficiently domesticated. We often at-
tended the lightly fandangoes, and Harry
and myself frequently took occasion to
make ourselves agreeable to the "senori-
tas," and, although we were neither of
us much destinguished for our galantry
among the fair sex, we found our efforts
in this line proved eminantly successful
among these buinettes. Harry in partic-
ular was changed to a regular Lothario
and smashed up the young maidens hearts
like pipe stems. As for me, such at-
tempts were idle, for jealous eyes were
ever on the watch.
The men were an enervated puerile race
spending tleir time chiefly in idling and
loafing about, ,when not engaged in the
sports ofhhe village.

1I one day found a torn and soiled basis-
s ness card which by dint of much spelling
and supplying dificiencies, I finally made
out to read as follows.
HAZEN MITCHELL.
Dealer in Lumber
Bangor, Me.
How this card wandered away into
this out of the way place, others can
conjecture as well as I can, but I care-
fully preserved it, as containing the ouly
scrap of the English language which I
should probably see for some time.
Soon after our arrival here, the whole
village was thrown into intense excite.,
ment, on learning the arrival of a small
party of Araucanian Indians in their !vi-
cinity. It was probably a small party
lured hither by the chase, evidently
unconsious of their close proximity to a
Spanish town. These Indians ,are a
brave and warlike beople, whom the
Chilians have never been able to subdue,
and they still hold undisputed sway, over
a large extent of country. They are di.
vided into numerous clans and hold
the spanish race in the greatest abhor-
ance, waging a war of extermination
against the whole race, murdering the
inhabitants of the frontier, and frequent-
y making descents upon the villages
and towns. It was considered by the
Spaniards a praiseworthy act, and religious
duty, to destroy these terrible enemies
whenever chance threw them in their
power. The present seemed a fitting
opportunity, and the whole male popula"
tion capable of bearing arms were soon.
in their saddles. Harry and I,'of course
could not remain behind, but fully armed
and mounted, we joined theft ited

Wit of a wite. I replied to hira that I
thought there was but littl  need of
that, but he seriously informed' me that
he had heard of a rich old Englishman,'
who had a large and valuable plantation,
well stocked with cattle &amp;c. He was al-'
so the owner of a rich silver mine, a source'
of unbounded wealth. This man was re-'
ported to have but- one child, ai only
daughter, whorl the father had frequent-
been heard to say, he desired to marry to
some countryman of his' own.
The lady was described as, having a
remakable strabismus of her eyes, and
being somewhat deformed in her person,
but Harry declared that the silver-mine
would cover all these blemishes, and, he
was determined to hunt her up. "But
what is the distance to this 'El Dorado,"'
I asked. "Some twenty or thirty miles
only,-if I find it a pleasant place to live,
I shall send for you, and perhaps by the'
aid of the old man's silver mine, we shall
be able to get back among civilized peo-
ple once more."
I could say but little for or against the
project, and I found it useless to murmur.
He parted from me full of visions of fu-
ture happiness. I did not fully realize,
until after his aepature, how much I was
indebted to him for companioLship. . I
grew lonesome and melancholy. Ibegan
to imagine him in all kinds of danger
my fancy pictured him dead or dying a

down in the firm conviction that I never
should see him ag .

people, I enquired whether they would

more he considered the matter, the more

denial. I could but admire the delibera-
tiveness with which he canvassed the
question of taking me to his home,,and I
felt perfectly satisfied after his first decis-
ion, it would be safe for me to venture
among them.
Giving up all hopes that Harry would
ever more be heard from, I decided
to leave with my Indian friend ; the life
that I led having become monotonous in
the extreme. We made all our arrange-
ments for the departure, and I had the
young Indian (still apparently unable to
stand 'alone,) conveyed to one of the
houses in the village to be cared for,while
my cabin was undergoing some repairs.
I took this precaution to hide my conni-
vance at his escape, not wishing to gain
the ill will of those who had thus far be-

into the clearing; my heart beat furiousl
as I'beheld a mass of savages hurrying t4

grave historians, holds his Royal Court

dressed in the airy costume of "a cocked
hat, ied' sash and spurs," and seated
astride of a Whiskey Barrel.
My friend Guvedio was instantly dragged
from the hose, and nearly devoured by
the caresses of the glad natives. His sis-
ter on some signal from him grasped the
rains of my animal and hurried me out
of the croud which was growing more
and more dense, and rode forward to her
own house. After a few hours I found,
that Guvedio had settled all scruples in
regard to myself. The natives would
occasionaly wander towards the htit
where I was seated with Metina and
others, and offer to me their thanks for
the kindness I had shown their friend;

at an angle of about 45deg. to the ground,

and a few light bed clothes of home man-

each bed from the main apartment and
from each other. The cabins contained
two, three, or four beds according to the
wants of the family. On the front side
of these snug bed chambers, was placed
a large square log which' served for the

usually kept in a small out house attached
to the main cabin, where were stored such
articles as could be conveniently dispensed

CHAPTER XI.
Our establishment was thronged dur- yet his tall stately form had but slightly

ing the evening with numerous visitors,
and I noticed with pleasure the univer-
sal attachrd&amp;ent with which Guvedio was
regarded. He would turn to me often and
endeavor to explain the substance of
their remarks; some of the more fiery ones
I noticed were anxious to sally out and
visit the Spaniards with a sprinkling of
war, and Guvedio appeared disposed to
listen favorably to the scheme. His eyes
would brighten up at the thought of
victory and revenge. When we were
alone I endeavored to dissuade Guvedio
from the project of invading the Spanish
settlements, telling him that in case his
people succeeded in breaking up the
village it would soon be again inhabited,
as the Spaniards were as plenty as the
leaves on the trees. I described to
him the large cities of Conception, Santi-
ago, and Valparaiso, and as I heard no
more about it I suppose the project was
abandoned or postponed.
In the morning I was conducted to the
chief, where I found assembled all the
tribe, male and female. The old men
and females were seated nearest to the
chief, whose whitened locks betokened
that the weight of years was upon him,

yielded to the inroads of time. Guvedio
sat at his feet, and myself, being the ob-
ject of consideration, was seated close to
my friend who acted as a sort of interpre-
ter. In answer to the first question as to
what nation I belonged, I gave then to
understand that I came from the north, a
great many miles, over a large lake a
thousand times as large as theirs ; that I
came in a large canoe that would hold an
army of men. My description of the
working of the vessel filled them with ex-
treme wonder ; but old Augus-ti-ne-vi nod-
ded his head in a knowing manner, and
assured them that he had heard ot such
a wonder before.
I told them that the people ofmy coun-
try were as numerous as the trees in the
forest; that they traveled all over the
world; that there was scarcely a spot up-
on the whole globe which had not been
visited by sone of them, and that I, par-
taking of the- roaming character of my
countrymen, had been led to visit them
here. I furthermore informed them that
some of my people could make machines
to travel through the air like birds, and
that some day they might be surprised to
see some of them fly down from over the

mountains and alight among them like a them to renewed attempts; and in a few

a hollow place in the ground, of sufficient-
dimensions to contain the body of the
animal which wasto form the principal

It is described in the poem  that Ln
coyan the former Togui had occasioned
sonie dissatisfaction, and it was deter-
mined to select another in his place, and
the Ulmenes were accordingly assembled
for the purpose of filling the vacancy; but
were at a loss 'to select from among the
aspirants, when Colocolo an old chief,
proposed that the office should be given
to the man who could prove himself the

To guide to vengeance our impatient bands.
Fit for this hardy task that chief I deem
Who longest may sustain a massive beam.

And for the strongest let his limbs decide."
They acquiesed in the props 1, and a
beam was produced of such an enormous
size that the poet declares himself afraid
to specify its weight. The first chief-,
tains who engaged in the trial, supported
it on their shoulders four and six hours
each ; Tucapel fourteen, and Lincoyaa
more than twice as long ; when. the as-
sembly, considering -his strength the
greatest were about to restore him to his,
former dignity. - At this moment Caupoli-
can the Ulmen of P lmayquen demands a
trial- and surpasses Lineoyan; and he was
accordingly: pronounced Toq ui or Gen-

J heilake of Wonseta is one of the
10% beautiful and romantic scenes in the
wrldsurrounded as it is by beautiful
mountain .landscapes 'of perpetual rich-
nessmagnificence and beauty, the bold
101310na ridges, and solitary cliffs among
)iitghe little lake has nestled, gives it
a tizOf sublimity and grandeur as im
prep$ve, as its beauty is attractive. To
egp oteits beauties and revel in its en-
ehantingloveliness was my pastime; and
indonapay with my lovely Indian maid.
en     would paddle our canoe beneath
son overhanging cliff which hung in1
sota  grandeur above the still waters
and 0"rough some shapeless breach, gaze
o the high-born torrent, as he came
1eins; from his-giddy shelf, twisting ands
sio a in the aerial flight, till he dashes
'idh deafening roar, on the whitened rocks
below, then struggling in'his hasty retreat
frt thebbiling chaldron,' rush,-with pan-
bti reath,' to the calm embraces of the
.placid lake. Again we would glide into

the quiet nooks and dells, and land in-the
deep recesses, where the light scarcely,
entered,.and tread the deep mazes' of
these caverns and grottoes of the cliffs;
with slow ahd cautions steps,; then issu.
ing forth again we would lay in our float-
ing cradle on the still glassy surface of
the lake, and gaze on the clouds, the
rocks, and the deep rich foliage reflected
on its bosom.
While out on one of these excursions,
enjoying the enchanting scenery of the
lake and the landscape, I proposed that
we should extend' our sail further and
proceed down the river where I had not
yet been. .Metina accordingly directed
our head to the outlet of the pond, and
sent the light fabric skimming over the
glassy surface. On entering the river
my eyes were enraptured with the love-
ly images which were constantly pre.
sentirg themselves, The scenery along
the river was variable and, delightful, the
,waters were, clear and transparent as

tation flourished in abundance, and' here
among fruits of gold, had been formed;ta
delightful path, hugging the stream in all,
its windings, gorgeously strown with ge-
raniums, whispering thyrtles, and other
flowering shrubs, along its winding ave-
nues. At points along the. river,. gentle
undulating declivities came sloping down
to the waters edge from the far off' hills
which lifted up their heads in the dis-
tance, while the mystic and dark clouds
hung like spirit shapes on their highand
frosty cones.
Sometimes a thicket of cane break,
with tangled masses of wild shrubs and
creeping plants decorated the bank, and
were vocal with the songs of birds ; the
streaming of the sunbeams on their gay
plumage, the burnished river beneath us,
and the dark belt of forest trees stands
ing out in bold relief against the illumin.I
ed sky, presented a gorgeous scenic
view scarce equalled in the world. A-
long the whole course of this delightful
stream, its banks were margined with a]
fringe of perpetual glossy verdure, and
its bright pathway, winding in a thous-
and graceful mazes, was charmed with
the  musical notes of the featheredI
songster and its own clear voice of gush-I
ing melody,
Along the sides of the gentle declivi-
ties rising before us, were the fig trees
and citrons, the luscious peach, and the
high spreading palm, with the tresselledc
vines in their richest foliage, decking the
narrow areas, the whole together exhibit- l
ingl one blended scene of rural loveliness,i
For hours we skimmed' along in si-t

five or six foxes, one vicuna, some half'
dozen chinchilas, and a few of a species of
rat whose skins are highly prized. The
Guanaco,a species of goat considered very
difficult to kill were seen in the neigh-
borhood but none were taken. Their wool
is fine and valuable, more so than any
other animals which are sought after. I
killed two of the chinchillas, which are
little animals about the size of a cat-
having fur not inferior to a martini. I
also shot a large condor. This bird pos-
sesses amazing, strength and will run or
fly with incredible swiftness. They are
three or four times larger than our eagle
with wings at least fourteen feet from
end to end. Its feathers are a dark brown
with a white collar round its neck. After
egpperi turned in, but slept badly owing
1p, the excitement of the hunt, I was
4apgeus to succeed as well as the'others,
,.nd so far I had. All night ,I was busy
lj pursuit of game full of eager anxiety.

waiting to swallow our breakfast. I had

tions ihad gained a wild and romantic
..ft.  among the mountains; on every

lowed in his track but-soon. lost sight of
him however in the darkness which per.
vaded the subterranean vault,but hearing
mysprize ashort distance in advance of me
as he bounded among the broken stones,
I pressed on, although with' extreme
difficulty, my head often coming in con-
tact with the low arches.
The passage soon became exceedingly
narrow and in some places so low that I
was forced to creep forward upon my
hands and knees. I crawled on in this
manner some distance, hoping every,
moment to lay my hand upon the
animal which I was pursuing, when I
heard a scraping noise and plunge not
three feet a-head of me, and before I had
time to think ot the cause, I found my-
self tumbling down a deep clasm in the
bottom of the cave, and alighted plump
upon the body of the wounded Guanico!
I dropped the gun during my descent
but found it again without much difficulty.
I was not seriously injured by the fall
but what was my consternation to find
that i was impossable to regain the top
of the sedge from which I-had fallen. I
tried in vain to clamber up the smooth
steep sides, but on every side they were
wet and slippery, and I only cut and
bruised myself in my attempt, and I threw
myself dcsponilingly on the ground ; must
I remain a prisoner in this dark and dis-
mal hole and like Othello's toad live upon
the murky vapors of a dungeon? this
question which I mentaly put to, myself
again aroused me to exertion, I groped
round in the dark and .dismal place for
I knew not how long,. hoping to find
some way of retreat, at last as the only
alternative [resolved to follow the stream

of water that run pouring along the bot-
tom of the cave, trusting it might lead
me towards daylight. With my gun in
my land I groped my way along, crawl-
ing on my hands and knees down the
oozy sdes of steep waterfalls, or sliding
over the slippery surface of the rocks
through some low arch while stretched
out at my full length, the merciless water
washing my prostrate form; and again
squeezing through numerous narrow pas-
sages that seemed at first scarcely wide
enough to admit a cat, or stumbling over
broken fragments of rocks which covered
the bed of the water course. I often felt
that my race was nearly run, expecting
momentarily to tumble over into some
deep basin, dashing my brains out upon'
the heaps of sharp stones at the bottom.
What a horrid place was this to die in,
with nought but the echoes of the rippling
waters to knell my souls exit ! what a
noisome mouldy shroud would cover my
form in this damp and dismal cavern!
I tried to whistle up my courage and
drive away these horrid thoughts but
every slip of my foot on the slimy ledge
would kindle them anew. With these
dismal thoughts I continued my sorrow-
ful course through these winding subte-
raneous corridors of the Andes.
This it is true was the dark side of the.
picture. Every situation in life it is said
has its lights and shadows, and mine I
found had its glittering points, and themes
for variety ; for had the, hollow worldly
honors of pomp and pageantry, the power
to influence my pride, I might have been
flattered with the idea that over my moul-
dering remains would stand one of the
proudest monuments in the world. That
I should have above me the topling crags

-of the lofty Qordilleras for Ty pedestal,
and the earthquake's solemn monio
chant forth my requium.
After many. dreary hours of taure
and suspense in worming myself ,hr ihih
these  low  and   damp    arche;  I
caught sight at last of a golden strea1pof
day-light. I had emerged into   gr
e opening where I could walk with eap ,
and which appeared some ten or twe e
feet in height; at the end, the lightust
gleamed through a small and narrow Ceoy-
ice. I hastened forward towards this gol-
den gleam of light as fast as the darkness
would permit, and discovered a narrow
rent in the ledge not more than two or
three inches wide. I was almost in des-
pair at my disappointment,but knowingit
was useless to despond, I began a search-
ing examination on all-sides, and son
found that near the floor the ledge was
loose and shaky, so that with but very
little trouble I enlarged the aperturesuf-
ficiently to crawl out of my dreary prison
house.  Aristomines, the hero of 'es-
sina, could not have been more pleased
at his escape from the subterraneous pas-
sage of the horrids charnel cavern of Ce.
ada, than I was at my final exit from the
bowels of the Andes.
It was quite dark when I emerged into
the open air, and after two hours travel
I saw with delight the fire of our srall
encanipment, where stood my own ltte
tent welcoming me with its 6pen portal.
I arrived faint, hungry and weary, 'at ur
welcome woodland bower. I found rny
companions all in and anxiously waidig
for me. They were much surprised0and
amused at the rehearsal of my adventnr,
and declared their determination to se~ure
my Guanico on the morrow. I eat y

stupper with as keen a relish as hunge
ever gives, and slept through the nigh
as sound and pleasant as a New Yorl
miilionare on his soft velvet couch.,
In the morning I found that my gut
needed a great deal of fixing to get i
in proper trim for duty ; it had received'
somee pretty hard thumps and bruises dur
ing its'transit 'through the earth. Witi1
the assistance of one of my companions
We managed to get it in tolerable good
order, and after trying it two or three time
at a mark, I was satisfied of its power of
doing justice, when called upon to performs
duty.              -    .
We started for the depot of the under-
ground rail-road which I had so thoroughly
explored the dy previous, and after some
ingenious contrivances succeeded in haul-
ing out my prize ; this was the firstlour
party had secured, and of course I was
j ustly proud.
During the remainder of this day we
were all much more successful than we
had before been ; we surprised a drove
of vicunas, and succeeded in capturing
several, we killed some twenty chinchil-
las, ten or twelve foxes and rats, and- a
few smaller animals whose names were
unknown to me. I clambered during the
day nearly to the summit of one of the
lofty peaks, that raised its majestic head
far into the regions of the clouds. As I
toiled up the rugged steep, I thought of
the gallant "San Martin," who led the
liberating army across this formidable
srrier-an achievement more daring and
difficult than that of the renowned "Han-
nibal" in crossing the Alps. BLdt no ob-
'stacle could intimidate the stout and
oble heart of San Martin ; he started
'With is army from the western confines

S IN CHILI

r of the "United Provinces," and in their.
t teen days he crossed the frozen'Andes, a
distance of 300 miles, with baggage and
artillery, over rugged and apparently in-
n accessible summits, through narrow de.
files where two could scarcely  w'alk
1 abreast, and along the giddy verge of
frightful precipices, icy with the eternal
frosts which here hold their undisputed
reign. Having conquered the Andes, he
encountered the royalists at Chacabuco,
and won a signal victory over the instru-
ments of tyranny, he afterwards com-
pletely overthrew and annihilated the
Spanish army, and sealed the independ.
ence of Chili on the plains of Maypu.
I soon gained an altitude above the
floating vapors of the earth. It was a
grand and marvellous sight to witness the.
clouds floating beneath me, and hiding'at
ti mes all traces of the boundless forest
and spreading out like the vast ocean as
far as the eye could reach, with the moun-
tain tops peering through the mist like
islands resting on the bosom of the un-
fathomable'deep. It required but a very
slight degree of ideality to imagine the
huge billows following each otherin rapid
succession, and breaking against the
mountain sides, sending their' whiteied
foam curling up in endless shapeseven
to their very summits, ad thence moving
offin the distance like an ariii of Ossiarls

shadowy ghosts.
I was transported with the everchang-
ing scene, and loitered away many hours,
so loth was I to quit the enchanting spot
but .the occasional report of my comrades'
guns, reminded me that II was forming
my character as a huntsman, and would
be judged ly-ny success.

rest and start in the morning, but the poor
fellow had suffered so much, and deliver-
ance now appearing almost within his
reach, it was irrl)oSsible to induce him to a
moment's delay;'and I must confess, as
visions of home danced rapidly through
my mind, I felt somewhat impatient. I
accordingly turned to Guvedio and asked
him for two horses and an escort to conduct
us towards the Patriot army. The hors-
es were immediately furnished, and
Guvedio agreed to join the escort, not
doubting, our intention to return again.
In two hours from the time that Harry
made his first appearance, five of us were
dashing through the woods, under a full
press of rein and spurs. We rode rapid-
ly all night, and found during the next
day we had struck the trail of the advance-
ing column. I now explained to Guve-
dio our intention, and the danger of his
proceeding any further with us. The
truth seemed to flash suddenly upon his
mind. It was an event lie had not be-
fore dreamed of, and consequently he was
but little prepared  for the' seperation.

entreating looks and words urged me to

I removed my cravat. and placing it on

tina. I then affectionately gave him a
parting embrace, jumped on my horse,
and dashed forward on the trail of the
moving army. I turned my head once
and saw my Indian friend, with lingering
looki still gazing after me. I stood up in
my stirrups,'lifted my hat, and swinging

adieu. We now put spurs to our horses,
and drove on at a rapid rate, fully confi-
dent we should come up with the encamp.
meant before day break and so it turned
out.
We saw the camp-fires about midnight,.
and rode boldly up to the entry. We
were detained until the commander was
informed of the circumstances of our ar-
rival, when after a few words of explana-
tion we were welcomed within the lines,
and patrook of a soldier's fare.
Our story excited much wonder, and we
were looked upon with as much amaze-
ment aswe had before excited among-
less enlightened beings. During our
march to Valparaiso, we were the lions.
of the army, and our adventures, the
theme of constant discussion.
We arrived at Valparaiso, in a few
days where we were strongly urged to
join the army, on their expedition to Pe-
ru. This arrangement we declined, but
compromised the matter with them, how-
ever, by entering the Patriot Naval ser-
vice. The brig of war "Achilles," Com.
Paul Delano, was laying in the harbor,
ready for sea. We accordingly shipped
in her, and immediately repaired on
board.
Valparaiso when viewd from the an-
chorage, scarcely merits the name it
bears, (the vale of Paradise.) At the
first glance it appears dark, craggy and
fearful; broken into suceessive hills, val-
leys, and wild glens, with a small por-
tion of sand beach, scarce wide enough
for a mule path. In the back ground,
hills iise upon hills overlooking, each
other, and extending far in: the distance,

wild cliffs, steep promentoiies and bar.
ren hills stands the city of Valparaiso, a
place, which, when once seen, will nevi
er be forgotten.  As the Rev. Waltei
Colton says. "It will stand alone- in
your after dreams, like Jacob's ladder.
like the rounds of that airy vision, its buil -
dings ascend roof over roof, till they seem
to topple in the sky."  Vie wed from the
sea its appearance is truly picturesque:
the houses grouped thickly together, ap-
parently without order on the three
principal hills, with the valley's and
spaces between, resemble several dis-
tinct towns. A turmber of neat detach-
ed houses are built on little levels arti-
ficialy formed on the sides of the hiih
fronting the harbor, while now and they
a stray white house is to be seen on some
lofty hill beyond.
The harbor scarcely deserves the name.
It is but little better than an open road-
steac\, entirely exposed on the north and
west, to the "Northers" which are often
violent, and are an admonition to all ships
to slip their cables. Many vessels have
been driven a shore, on a rock, called
"little Cape Horn."  On the south it isI
protected by a little promontory, called
'Puenta de Coro Milla,' where the shore
is steep and rocky; from hence, the bay
extends from E to W in the form of at
gently curved crescent. Fort San Anton-
ia is on the south inlet of the bay, andI
"Castello del Resario," mounting six guns
stands in the north part of the town.
Immediately in front of the bay, and one
fourth of a mile on the east and west, ist
the principal commercial city of business
and fashion. Back and westward of this
are three large groups of houses scattered
on the three hills, called by the sailors,

the "Fore, Main and Mizen-tops:"' About
half a mile eastward on the lowland, is1
the 'A lmendra'-Almond grove=where
the houses extend perhaps a mile or
more; they are built like the others, prin_
cipally of reeds, some are constructed of
abedos. The Custom House - however is
a beautiful and spacious building,, and
from its situation on the mole where the,
stranger first lands, is an object which
attracts the attention of all who arrive
at Valparaiso. Quite near the Custora
House is another fine building called the
Exchange.
There is a peculiar inconsistency con
nected with the interior of the dwellings
which cannot fail to strike an American
with sur rise. The plainest looking c t*
tages which gleam from the topling cliffs;
are provided with the most costly, and
aristocratic furniture. The piano, the
'harp and guitar are heard in almost every
house.. They appear   singularly  out.
of place in these savage abodes. The
most elegant articles of ornament are al-
so found in their fancy shops, and the
ladies are decked out with large ribh tor-
toise shells combs, wrought into various
figures.,
The Elective franchise in Chili is the
same as in America. No property quali-
fication is required, all go to the ballot
box, yet a majority of them can scarcely
be called independent voters, influenced
and overawed as they are, by the priests
and land-holders, by the priests at the
confessional, and by the landlords with
their (rentals,) for the innequality of the
feudal system still survives as originated
from Old Spain. The lands are owned
by the privileged few, and their succession
secured by theriight of entail.
