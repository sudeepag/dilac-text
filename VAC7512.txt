CHAPTER I.
Every remarkable spot has its legend,
fraught with events that have trans-.
pired on its premises. With some,
the crumbling finger of time has erased
the once legible marks which may
have been chronicled of them ;--
With others, oblivion has enshrouded
all record of the soul-stirring scenes
which have taken place, enveloped in
mystery at the time ; and at the pres-
ent, many are still veiled by the muta-
tion of years that have passed.  .
Fort Hill, however, within the lim-
its of Auburn, is. too well known to
the curious, and lovers of the antique
in this region, to point out its locality.
A part of the still visible rampart of
some ancient place of defence which
crowns its summit, and the area with-
in the purlieu or earthy wall, denote
that there is no fiction of its existence;
and thatthe handswhich erected it, did
it for defence in some war either among
the aborigines, or progeny of human
beings which once strode this region.
Be that as it may, Fort Hill stands; the
summit of which,. exhibits a visible
site of past scenes of war, before which
the curtain of time has hung for ages
unexplained, Though altered now

from its once wild and uneven aspect
by the hand of civilization, and cori.
vested into a city cemetry by the cit-
izens of Auburn, and dotted arhong.its
forest trees with beautiful marble
grave-stones and monuments, where
rest the departed of the city and sur-
roundings, it presents the same sum-
mit and appearance of the site of an
ancient fort. Amid the monuments
that tower among the gravest is one
erected to the memory of "Logan" the
friend of the white man ; who it was
said was a Chief of the Cayugas, and
may for aught we know, have figured
as the conspicuous brave mentionedby
the writer of this Tale, in the-perilbtts
scenes experienced by the characters
who form  the heroes introduced.-.i-
That Logan was once the friend of the
white man, history records a speech of
his, bearing uncontestible evidence,
which we quote asfollows:
' Speech of Logan, a Mingo chief,
to Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virgin-
ia,-1774.
" I appeal to any white man to
say, if he ever entered Logan's cabin
hungry, and he gave him no meat.; if
ever he came cold and naked, and he
clothed him not. During the course
of the last long and bloody war, Loa-

gan remained idle in his cabin, an ad-
vocate for peace. Such was my love
for the whites, that my contrymen
pointed as they passed, and said:
"Logan is the friend of the white
man."
. "I had even thought to have lived
with you, but for the injuries of one
man. Colonel Cresap, last spring, in
cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered
all the relations of Logan, not even
sparing my women and children.-
There runs not a drop of my blood in
the veins of any living creature. This
called on me for revenge. I have
sought it : I have killed many : I have
fully glutted my vengeance.
"For.my country, I rejoice at the
beams of peace ; but do not harbor a
thought, that mine is the joy of fear.
Logan never felt fear. He will not
turn on his heel to save his life: Who
is there to mourn for Logan?  Not
one."
On the monument erected on Fort
Nill to the memory of this Chief is
engraven the memorable words of the
close of his touching appeal, "Who is
there to mourn for Logan ?"
From the summit of the site of
this ancient place of defence, now, the
eye rests in every direction upon the
works of civilization: The dense
forest which once surrounded it, has
now almost vanished as it were from
the country and where thick roots
supporting the countless trees which
overshadowed the earth, green fields
are now presented to the eye ;-the
morning sun which once shone upon
the vast wild woods around it, now
throws its rising beams upon the
dwellings of civilization, and temples
of worship to that God by whose prov-
idence the rough places are made
smooth. Though time, in a measure,
rith its desolating hand his levelled

the earthy battlements ; and majes-
tic trees, towering high, now stand
upon some parts of them, as sentinels,
having braved the tempests of revolV'
ing seasons, and grown from sprout to
maturity ; they lead the mind back
through the vista of years that are past,
to dwell on scenes that have transpir-
ed beneath their umbrageous branch-
es.
The early scenes of this region of
country, when the brave and intrepid
Sullivan passed through it, with his
dauntless band of continental heroes,
traversing its pathless wilds, opposed
step by step, by the red men who ten-
anted it, have been recounted by his-
torians, contemporary with the era in
which they were enacted ; and of the
bloody track of his detachment of the
revolutionary army through these
once savage wilds, and the -privations
and hardships they endured, records
have been kept in memory by many
of these actors, though the most of
those actors have descended to the
tomb.
It was previous to Sullivan's expe-
dition that the scenes of this present
Tale transpired, to commence which,
we must carry our readers back to the
highest point of navigation  on the
North River, to an occurrence in the
early history of its settlement:-
It was one afternoon in the month
of September, that two Dutch settlers
were standing on the bank of the Mlud-
son, near a small cluster of rudehous-
es.
"See you that far-off sail, booming
up the river ?" said one of them, Der-
rick Van Hetter, to the other, his
brother-in-law,Dan Van Valkenburgh,
a stout, thick built youth, of about
nineteen ; "there are guilders on board
that craft," continued he, and he doub-
led his finger and thumb in a circle,

peeping through, to survey the vessel
as she cut through the little billows.
"Guilders, did you say, bub Het-
ter ?" asked the youth.,
"Yaw ; or there is on board what
will be its equivalent in guilders," an-
swered van. Hetter.
"It may be so," responded Van
Valkenburgh.
"I know it-I know it," repeated
Better, always positive, whether right
or wrong. "What say you to that sail
yonder, De Faun ?" continued he,
turning to a rather gigantic figure, with
a French look, that af"the moment'
came up by their side.
"What say I to that clipper, down
by the bend of the river ?" answered
De Faun.
"Yaw-has she not the useful on
board her ?" asked Derrick.
"No---she's an American streeker,
that comes and goes, and never lands,"
replied he, "her skipper sleeps with
one eye open-he knows the pirates
of the ocean, besides the land pirates
of these parts, as well as you, Derrick."
"And what do I know ?" muttered
Hitter, reddening up to his eyes.
"Ye know enough to gain a gibbet
yet, for your vile plunders of the craft
that trade here," retorted De Faun.
"Stop there, now," said the youth,"
"no inuendoes against Derrick"-,
"No, no," interrupted Derrick--
"nor accuse me of plunder, when you
are in alliance with all the natives be-
tween the rivers,"
"It's a lie-and he who says it shall
eat his words, and sink or swim in the
stream," loudly answered De . Faun,
.whose countenance all at once swell-
ed with rage while his eyes flashed
like fire.
"I may eat my own words ; but not
swallow yours," said Hetter, drawing
himself up, and pulling his old red cap
more firmly on his head.

"Then take thatcheefrst,' Iid
De Faun, raising his brawny a  rnand
giving Derrick a blow which mighti
have felled a bullock.
"And here I spit it et you/'j angtily
retorted Derrick, as he returned the
salutation with his heavy fist full in
the face of De Faun,
"You'll swallow yet, or choke," re-
plied De Faun, as he recovered from
the blow of Derrick, and threw him-
self forward, grasping him by the
throat with a tenacity that soon eanush
ed the naturally dark complexion of
his antagonist to turn to a deeper hub,
and his eyes and tongue to.start, while
he gasped beneath the iron grip of
his adversary.
"Hold ! De Faun," ejaculated Yan
Valkenburgh, on seeing them, "or by
mine Got-! I'll tear that hand of youi.
from its joint !"
De Faun knew the hercflean
strength of the youth' who addressed
him, but his naturally fiery disposition
was excited, and he still clasped .ha
Better.
"Will you let loose ?" vociferated
the youth.
"No," retorted De Faun.
"Then you'll. not hold you'r pipe
to-night with one hand," answered
Van Valkenburgh, seizing the hiad
that grasped the throatof his brother-
in-law,and with a giant strength erug4
ed the bones until he relaxed hishold;
when Van Hetter, black and strvMgf,
led, fell to the ground almost lifeless.
;"See that, you knave," continue lhe
youth, as with a tremendous etffrtihe
hurled De Faun from him, twisting
the limb he held in his grasp to the
parting of the joint, when he Ie1;

ately some eight or ten feet off. "Did
I not tell you I'd disjoint it ?" he e.-
solutely exclaimed.

The gasping Van Hetter now slow-
ly recovered as he-lay on the ground;.
but could not speak ; while De Faun.
writhing with pain from his dislocat-
edlimb, and maddened to desperation
rushed toward the settlement, appar-
ently determined on revenge.
As soon as Van Hetter had recov-
eredsufficiently to articulate, he, ter-
magant like, vented his strangulated
throat with a torrent of epithets a-
gainst De Faun. "Cursed pimp of-
the river cruisers !" exclaimed he,
"low, base informer, and hypocritical
traitor to his neighbors ! Does hey
think to stop a Van Hetter's trade ?-
Here, Dan," continued he, raising
himself up, and addressing Van Valk-
enburgh, "hear me! 'that creeping
slave -De Faun, shall die for this--I
have sworn it."
"No, Bub; take not that from any
one which you can never return. Rec-
ollect, blood for blood may be requir-
ed of thee," mildly replied the youth.
"De Faun must have his time."
"It's short-it's short !" muttered'
Derrick, reeling around, still weak
from the-throttle of De Faun. "But
look, 1)an ! look at the craft, she is:
making for the landing."
"She is, sure," replied the youth.
"Can you see the guilders, Derrick ?"
added he laughing at his brother-in-
law;
"I -ill see them." answered he, fix-
ing his-eyes on the vessel as she cut
her way up the river.,
"Honest, I hope," said Dan.,,
:"Yaw." ironically replied Derrick ;
"ab it see! there comes that cursed pimp'
De Faun, with four of his clan."
"It is so," muttered the youth.-
"Derrick, if they are for fight, "stand
you still, and I will meet them."

CHAPTER. It.
Fearless young Van Valkenburgh
stood, alternately eyeing the vessel
and the approaching party. The long,
low built, black hull of the craft was.
co different from any he was in the
habt of seeing, that he could not con-
jecture what she was. His thoughts,
however, of tiheP vessel were quickly
directed into another channel as the
five men neared him.
Slowly De Faun andi ti four men
came towards the bank, the former
holding his maimed arm and hand
with the other. At a short distance
they all stopped and held an apparent
consultation for some minutes. At
length they moved again towards
where Derrick and Dan were stand-
idg. "You see they were two to one,"
muttered De Faun to his followers.
Dan walked a few steps forward to
meet them, when De Faun, boiling
with rage, and excited with the pain
of his broken, dislocated limb, drew a
long knife and rushed upon him; call-
ing upon the others to come on.
With a dexterous motion of his arm,
the youth parried the blow aimed at
at him by the enraged De Faun, and
immediately grappled in with him,
hurling him in an instant to the ground
with a force that left him almost life-
less. "Am I a mad dog;" said he,
'that I should be attacked in thisway ?,
The companions of De f'aun stop-
ped a moment, and gazed upon the
youth. His eyes were emitting the
excited gleams of his indignant feel-
ings, yet he stood over his prostrate
foe without offering any other vio-
lence. He stood upon his defence a-
lone, and conscious of his. superior
strength.
De Faun stirred not now, for the
force with which he had been hurled

to the ground, had stunned him. Vat
Better on seeing the struggle of Day
with De Faun, with hasty stride
moved to assist him, his blood heate
with anger. "Hold! Van Hetter,'
said the youth, "I am sufficient fo
him, and his comrades are peaceable.'
By this time the vessel had round.
ed to at the landing ; and Vai.1 Hette]
turning on his heel, left the spot, pro
feeding towards her, and was soon
followed by the rest, leaving De Faun
laying upon the ground where Dan
had hurled him.
It was now for the first time; that
Van Hetter discovered that the little
vessel had port-holes, and that she
was armed with cannon. She also
was built different from the craft that
occasionally stemmed the river so far
up; and among a crowd of men who
was on deck, they discovered one who
wore the dress of a naval officer. No
indications from the' vessel appearing
to invite them on board, they stood
looking at her until twilight faded a-
way, and the evening sh des mantled
surrounding objects in d rkness, when
Van Hetter with the rest, slowly mov-
ed ,towards their habitations. YGicder..
ing what the object of the craft could
be-.
Early the next morning, the whole
body of settlers were there, .,on the
look out, to watch the motions of those
who were on board the vessel ; on the
afterpart of the deck of which they
discovered a cluster gathered togeth-
er, and among them, much to their
surprise, they saw De Faun.
"What means that ?"' asked V n
Hetter of his brother-in-law.
"I know not," replied he.
Soon after a small boat cont ' ing
ten or twelve persons, among  em a
female, was seen to leave the vessel,
and propelled by two sturdy oarsmen,1

n moved up the river, following the sin-
n uous course of the shore to avoid the
s current, and was soon lost sight of.
d   "That fellow De Faun, has fairly
" bamboozled . you," said Dan to Van
r Hetter, as the party in the boat was
" lost to sight.
-   "Yaw," replied Van Hetter, his
r face reddening with vexation.
-  Nothing more was said by the two;
n and ere the day passed off, it was dis.
covered by the settlers, that Van Het-
ter was missing; and no one 'knew
where he had gone or for what cause
t he absented himself.
It will be recollected that De Faun,
the day before, was left'laying on the
ground. After they had gone, he rose
t with some difficulty anfd made the
best of his way to his rude dwelling,
which stood embosomed a short dis-
tance in the forest, back of the few
houses that were located at the land-
ing. No sooner, however, had night
set in, than he proceeded to the spot
where the vessel lay. As he approach-
ed her, he was hailed from the deck,
and after a few exchange of questions
was permitted on board and ushered
below ; and was seen the next morn'
ing in conversation with the clustei'of
men on the deck.
Towards night the boat which had
left the vessel was observed returning
down the river, with De Faun and
two others ; and soon after he landed,
the vessel got underway, and ww(
soon laying her course down the
stream.
Various were the conjectures of the
few settlers on the shore, after the ves-
sel had disappeared from sight, and
their-curiosity was heighte/d more
the, next day, at finding De f'aun mis-
sing as well as Van Hetter.' The ab-
sence of the latter could not be accoun-
ted for, as he seldom left the settle,

mit," said Allen, seizing one himself,
and dauntlessly pursuing his way up
the mount.
CHAPTER. III.
Slowly now the party, each with a
burning brand gleaming before him,
moved along the side of the hill, while
an occasional wild scream sounded a-
bove, and the tramping of animals was
heard as if leaving their coverts.
"Blast these catamounts and bears ?"
audibly exclaimed Bob Walker, one
of the party, the old 'weather-beaten
sailor with a wooden leg, as they ad-
vanced a short distance-"I'd rather
brave a real north-easter with a heavy
sea, or encounter an English man of-
war at close quarters, than be laid
broadside with one of them. Fair
fight, and no biting or gouging, I like ;
but blast me, if I understand this fight-
ing of every species of God's creation,
creeping and upright, that'moves on

"Hold, Walker," said the strong,
athletic personage of the company,
who carried the sword, and whom
they called Bond-"you must look
sharp, or the grapples of some of these
wild inhabitants will fasten on you.
They board one without any ceremo-
ny."
"I know it" replied Walker ; "but,
is it a .fact, Master Bond, that these'
bears hug a man to death ?"
He had scarce uttered the question,'
when a sullen growl just above his
head, saluted his ears, and the grating
sounds of something sliding over the
rough bark of a tree close by him, ar-
rested.his attention, as well as some of
the rest of the party.

"There is one of the gentlemen you
was inquring about. Bob. You can
shake hands with him if you choose,"
said Bond to the old sailor.
Walker immediately raised his blaz-
ing faggot, and discovered a tolerable
sized bear descending the tree. "Bet-
ter keep. aloft, shipmate," said he,
springing towards him and fearlessly
fastening his hands in the long hair
with which he was covered.
The bear stopped an instant on be-
ing taken hold of, and then *began
slowly to ascend the tree, Walker
holding on with all his strength, to
pull him to the ground. Bruin how-
ever, raised himself, and slowly mov-
ed up the trunk of the tree, Walker
holding on with both hands. After
peing raised some five or six feet, and
ending he was in a fair way of getting
farther above terra firma than he wish-
ed with such company, Walker let go
and dropped upon the ground  de

himself up from his fall, and eyeing
the ascending bear, drily muttered to
himself, "Blast you, I had a short
ride any-how, you lubber !" and look-
ing around. found he was alone.-
Quickly picking up his fire-brand,
which lay blazing on the ground, as
he threw it down when he seized the
bear, he hastened after the rest of the
party, damning the "black devil's toe
nails," he having received a slight
scratch from one of the hind claws of
the bear, while hanging on to him.
As he overtook the rest, Bond burst
into a laugh. "Why, Bob, your, friend
in the tree seemed to want your com-,
pany."
"Yes, he scratched a slight acquaint-
ance," replied Walker, drily-"but
look here, Master Bond, he's no sail-
or."
"No sailor !---yah ! yah ! yahW---

"Gosh ! no, Massa Bob, guess not,'
replied Moses, with a continued broad
grin.
The party having now nearly reach
ed thegop of the eminence, clamber
ed over aimound of earth which of a
sudden presented itself before them
and seemed to extend in a circular
form enclosing an area of several rods
in diameter, Within this earthy wall
or bulwark, stood several large trees,
whose branches seemed locked and
interwoven with each other, forming
a kind of canopy, high above ; and the
ground was covered with broken limbs
and dry branches of them  and the
thick forest around.
On entering this area, the party
clustered together ; the evening air
surcharged with dampness, was begin-
nin to cause a heavy-dew, which in
distilling showers fell from the leaves,
and branches-of the trees upon them.
"There certainly have been scenes of
war upon this spot," said the captain,
addressing Allen.
"It was evidently a place of de-
fence," replied he. -
"By whom was it erected ?"
"The whites, I believe have never
been satisfactorily informed. The
marks of time stamp it at so remote a
period, that no one pretends to date
its erection. One thing alone is evi-
dent now, that at stated periods the
natives assemble here and take up a
temporary residence; but from appear-
ances, none have visited it for that pur-
pose of late."
The brief conversation of Allen and
the captain, was here cut short by theJ

r necessity of making preparations for
e rendering themselves comfortable for
a short time.
?  All hands immediately were busy
e in gathering something together for a
fire, and in making some kind of tem-
porary shelter for the night. The
I light cloth tent of Ella, the female
comprthion of the party, was raised,-
- and a quantity of dry leaves collected
- on one side for, a couch, and in a few
minutes a large. blazing fire sent its
gleams of light over the enclosure,
which, together with the bright moon,
illuminated the whole area around.
Weary with travelling, Ella entered
the tent which had been made as con-
fortable for her as possible, and throw-
'ing herself on the rude couch, soon
was lost in sleep.
Allen, after having seen that his
charge was as well sheltered as the
circumstances of the place would ad-
mit, and partaken with the rest of the
party some refreshments, wrapped
himself in his thick over-coat and be-
took him to rest.
In the meantime the youthful com-
panion, whom Walker called captain,
retired at some' distance ; and was soon
seen by Bond on the top of the wall,
moving slowly along gazing upon the
moon and countless stars which lit the'
heavens.
"Your shipmate seems to have ta-
ken the first watch," said Bond, ad-
dressing himself to Walker, laughing
and pointing to the young man.
"He lookingout forisqualls, massa
Bob, aint he ?"-bsked  Moses with a
knowing wink.a
A withering frown from Walker,
answered the black, and the words
addressed to Bond, of "belay there,
master Bond, say no more-you don't
know him," immediately stopped the
laughing of Bond.

"I know it," replied Bob, seating
himself; "but shove ahead, and never

is righted from his upset."
CHAPTER V.
The countenance of the old sailor
for a moment as he sat alone assumed
a rueful expression, at the mishap of
his wooden leg; but brightened some-
what at hearing tie cheerful sound of
the captain's voice, who fortunately
had received no injury from his fall
from the tree. Seeing the situation of
Walker, he rose, and smiling stepped
towards him. "What! another splin-
ter wound, Bob, ha !"-said he.
"Not exactly, sir ; though I'm
thinking it will want a little splinter-
ing on the larboard side here," rephed
Bob, still looking a little rueful at his
shattered stump.
"Just by way of a strengthening
plaster, I suppose," interrupted Bond
laughing at'the quizzical plight of the
old sailor,
"Just so, Master Bond." returned
Walker. "Here, Nig," looking to-
wards the black, "take your jack-knife
and cut a small wood plaster for your
shipmate's shin, and bind it on with
this," pulling a ball of tarred twine out
of his pocket. "I always keep spare
rigging about me on the land or water,

carrying extra spars about him in this
wooden country-one has no difficul-
ty in rigging, out jurymasts here-
plenty at hand on deck in every direc-

Moses, the black, soon cut a suita-
ble sticlS from one of the fallen branch-
es of the trees around them, and with
skill adjusted the broken fragment of
Walker's wooden limb, binding it on

Bond here asked Bob how he lost
his leg originally.
"Never mind that," replied he," it's
r a long whilesago. This much I will
tell you, it was not bit off."
"Nor shot ?'
"No,"
r "Nor frozen ?"
"'No. "                      .
f "How then ?-.--Nor jammed off?"
'"No."
"It must have been cut off, then,"
continued Bond, a littled vexed at the
equivocal, ambiguous manner he wa
getting so unimportant information.
"No," replied Bob, it was not cut
off."
['Tore off, Massa Bond, answered
the bliek, "splinter tore him off."
1Yes, tore off ! You see chalky's
told the truth," at length answered
Bob, his countenance exhibiting an in-
ward laugh, at the long, unsatisfied
curiosity of Bond.
"It's horrid thing, Massa Bond, to
have limb tore right off one's body,"
said the black.    -
"Yes," spoke Bond in reply, drily,
tho' still unsatisfied with the manner
in which Walker lost his leg.
"I helped him to cockpit for sur-
geon ; and carried down young Mas-
sa captain, soon arter," continued the
black.
"Who !" asked Bond:
"Massa captain, who stands out
there---he small midshipman at that
time; but never fear fight or blood,
no more than Massa Bob."
"Belay there, Ioses, the haulyards
of your tongue," exclaimed Walker.
"If you have done a good turn to your
shipmates, keep it to yourself, I say-
they never will forget it."
The words of Walker cut short the
communicative conversation of the
black at this time, and Bob stumped

round to try the strength of Moses surgi-
al operation on his wooden leg. "She is
o3nd as solid oak again," said he, flourish-
ing his timber leg around his colored com-
panion's head,
"IHem'm last a short voyage now, I
guess," said the black, rising, and turning
from the spot following after the captain,
leaving Bond and Walker together.
Bond now wished, yet hesitated, to ask
Walker some more questions, as his curi-
osity was raised to an unusual pitch.' At
length after a few moments, he remarked,
'Why Bob, you have seen some hard times
in company with the young captain ?"
"Yes, we've seen the rough as well as
smooth" replied he.
"An weathered many a storm, I should
think." i id ond.
"Aye sir, rejoined Walker, changing
hia quid of tobacco for a fresh one: "But
some how or other, you've a kind of en-
quiring turn, Master Bond; just lay to a
spell, and ask no more questions, will
you ?"
Bond bit his lips at this quietus to his
anticipated hopes of gratifying his curiosi-
ty, merely answering, "I love to hear the
long yarns of an old sailor, who has so-ma-
ny scenes to recount."
"No doubt, Master Bond, said Bob, "but

thing, which he pulled from his bosom.
The old sailor appeared in his element
on the result of the consultation, and the
sight of what was shown him by the cap-
tain, and stumped around almost in a per-
feet ecstacy.
It was not long after, before Allen, with
the captain and the black, left the H ill,
winding their way through the forest in a
northerly direction. "A safe voyage and
speedy return, captain," said. Walker, as her
parted with them; and you, Nig," contin-
ued he. addressing Moses, "keep your land
tracks within hail oftyour shipmates, lest
some Indian pirate run foul of you, and
make carrion of hallof you for the crows."
"Never you fear old nigger, Massa Bib,"
replied the black, twistingithe hand of the
old sailor in the vice-like grasp of his own
-"Moses keep in the wake of the captain."
Walker sat some time after they had
gone near the entrance of the shelter of
Ella, apparently in a deep study;-and
Bond was humming an old tune of "woods
and wilds," occasionally directing a word
or two between the stanzas, to the girl in
the tent.
"So it seems we are to keep garrison,
while our friends are absent," said Ella to
Bond. "God grant that we may not b

"Do !" cried Walker, his eyes brighten
ing at the mention of fight or danger
"Why, sweep the decks of them."
Ella smiled at the animation of Bob
and his fearlessness of danger, and mus
ing on her unpleasant situation, remained
silent, resolving to trust for the best, con
scious that murmurs and repining would
be of litle avail.
The remainder of the day wore away
heavily, but in the evening Walker recoun
ted some sea-faring scenes, though not par-
ticularly interesting to Ella; yet helped to
beguile the time; and at a late hour she
threw herself on her rude bed, while Bond
and Walker alternately watched and kept
a fire light, to prevent the interruption of
the wild beasts, which they could distinct-
ly hear after night fall, in the forest which
stretched around in every direction,
Though retired for the purpose, Ella
could not sleep, fancy continually pictur-
ing'to her a ruthless band of natives, ready
to inflict any species of torture and savage
cruelty, which, together with the wild
howls issuing occasionally from the forest,
drove sleep from her eyes. . She rose ear-,
ly, harrassed with the frightful images her
imagination had conjured up. The mor-
ning was fine, and she ascended the high-
est part of the earthen ridge, which cir-
cumscribed this part of the mount. The
faint, distant sound of running water could
be heard 'n the stillness, and the sun like
a globe of fire, appeared rising out of the
dense forest in the far east.
Continuing for some time casting her
eyes around, she noticed that Bond and
Walker were stirring, and heedlessly she
descended the hill on the east side and
entered a kind of partial opening which
extended a short distance striking a part
of the woods which was now thinly stud-
ded with trees, and leisurely wandered far-
theor on,

tion what changes in the order of time
might not take place ; when the present
aspect of the country would be converted
from a howling wilderness to seats of civil.
ization, and to the busy hum of life and
activity.
Suddenly she came to the bank of the
Owasco outlet, dashing and foaming along
over the bottom of a deep vale, the steep
sides of which it seemed almost impossible
to descend. The wild scenery around ore.
ated an awe in her mind, and her thoughts
wandered in contrast to her native hills
and streams, where civilization with its
industry had erased the solitude of a des-
ert, and caused their once wild aspect to
assume such a difference to the one before
her.
She thought of her home, and the friends
united to her by the ties of blood and na-,
ture, until the tears flowed unconsciously
from her eyes, while again the thoughts of
her pecular situation, in the wilds of an
almost trackless country, tennanted almost
only by ravenous beasts and untutored na-
tives, threw a melancholy gloom over her
mind, as she contemplated the views pre-
sented before her.
At length, trembling with emotion, she
sat herself on the high bank of the'rush.

One deafening shout rent the air, as
he made his appearance, and all was
but tie work of a motinet with Wa!-
ker, as he followed in track of his for-
ward companion.
Undoubtedly Bond threw himself
forward to meet them, his eyes shi-t
ning like meteors, while his ponder-
ous broadsword was whirled in every
direction. Aghast, the natives stop-
ped and at once started back with
awful yells, as they witnessed the de-
struction among them by one man ;
the concentrated whirlwind could not
sooner have cleared' the space where
they stood than the tremendous sweeps
of -his trusty blade, which at every
stroke laid some one of them a head-
less or a maimed trunk upon the
earth.
"Give it to them !" shouted Wal-
ker, rushing forward on his wooden
leg, wielding the stantion which sup-
ported the tent of Ella, which he had
seized with a giant strength as he
started, and was Hercules like, stri-
Iring down all before him. "Shiver
their timbers, my boy; and cut the pi-
rates' lanniards !"-continued he, hurl-
in the stick of wood among them,

o every side.

'"The infernal blood hotundk !" in ut-
tered Bond, wiping the large drops of
perspiration from his forehead, as he
surveyed the field of battle.
"Wood devils incarnate !" respon-
ded Walker, throwing his quid at one
of the prostrate lifeless Indians before
him, and turning the body  over with
his wooden stump. "It was no boy's
play in repelling such boarders as these

"Aye, Walker ; but there lays a
round dozen of them, who have lost
their dinner."
"And grog, too, I'm thinking," in-
terrupted Walker. '4hat one," con-
tinued he, kicking over a huge  av-
age that lay at his feet, "never 'kiew
what hurt him, when this little sprig
touched him about the upper story,
and broke his roof in."
"No,--nor this one either,"' ans-
wered Bond, raising the ghastly head
of one of them, which at a single
stroke had been severed from the
body.-"his carcass will not have the
headache again."
"Plast my two eyes !" ejaculated
Walker, I guess not-I reckon you

even swath as you swung the old steel
among them. You could not have
cut stubble smoother."

"I know it," said Walker deliberately
taking his jacknife and loosening the ros-

"No, darkee ! it would have been all

"Golly ! guess so !" replied the black.
At this instant the tall, powerful native
stepped forward supporting the disguised

It was at thisperiod, that the French1
and Indians of the Canadas were make

CHAPTER    XV.
The success of the black in thJrow-
ing .the champion of the natives' in
the sport they had commenced, arnd
the exultation of Walker, maddened
the savages, who alone had lingered
behind;, to gratify their disappointed
vengeance, at the unexpected rescue
of their victims from their hands.-
They had only waited for a favorable
moment to again seize upon them for.
sacrifice. The situation of the black
at this time, therefore, caused them to
rush upon him, and so sudden was
the onset, that they had :nearly ac-
complished their object before Moses
could recover himself ; but in an in-
stant he stretched,his body up and
shook them  off.  Quickly -several
more came up, and again they all
pitched upon him.
On seeing the attack upon the black,
whose herculean strength seemed put
forth in his own defence alone, Wal-
ker could not contain himself, but
loudly cheered him. At first, Moses
suffered them to tumble him around
without much resistance ; but when
three &amp;r four would take hold of each
arm, and, bracing themselves, pull as
if to wrench his joints asunder, the
eyes of the black began to shoa the
rising anger which they were gradu-
ally arousing. So many had fastened
themselves to his body and limbs that
his utmost strength had to be put in
requisition to keep them from bearing
him to the ground. : Sumnoning,
therefore, all his efforts, in one-grand
display of muscular strength, he re-
leased his nervous arms from the gripe

In the meantime, old Clefford wit,

trembled for the fate of his tugher.
He rushed from the tent among'hi
attempting to address thep; bvst fu
voice was lost in the deafe~g grelis

tent where Ella was.

ftom exertion, with dilated nostrils
and flashing eyes. "Nigger must
fight, or die, 'MAssa Bob," exclaimed
he, and he turned facing the reveng-

At the allusion by Clifford, of his
fighting. the natives, the old sailor
smiled, and turned his huge quid of
tobacco over in his mouth two or three
times, apparently miuch pleased.

- "And for that you'll be sacrificed,"
replied Clifford.

answered Walker, "I'll go content-.

she rising as if new strength had
suddenly been imparted to her; and
. she, gazed at the man with intense
earnestness.
At this instant quick steps were
heard,? and the twin brother Tom
stood before, thempanting, and knelt
before her: :.Thanks to theMighty
One, you are safe !", exclaimed he,
"Come, the army of the whites will
protect you ;" and in a brief manner
he informed her of the French in-.
cursions, whom they had met, and ac-
companied back, reaching Fort Hill
just in time,: probably, to save the
lives of her father, Walker, and the
black.
The sight of. the twin-brother,
whose life she was instrumental in:
preserving, caused the heart of Eila to
throb with quicker motions,. and she
accompanied her two friends back 'to

The party then with twoor three

accompanied them to the hill.

forces which had'inet the party, on
their way to the lake, induced them

decide d, that'the next morning they would

days. until be could make his arraugementa
for an attack on the Indians, who were as-
sembhing in the valley of the Onondaga,
and finding the party were about starting
for the Hudson, took the occasion of send
ing a few select men with them as a kind
of scouting party.
La Villiam and six men were acordingly
selected and notified to accompany the par-
ty as far as was thought consistent, and
make what discoveries they could of the
movements of the Indians.- Nothing could
have suited the French officer-more than
this resolution of his commander, and he
hastened to put himself in readiness, ani
impart the intended acoompaniament to
Ella and her father.
On issuing from her tent, after, having
made his communication, he met the twin
brothers, whQ arm in arm, were walking,
around, and with a haughty air, ironically
informed them, that his commander, solic-
itous for the safety of Miss Clefford and
those of her party, had selected him 'as a
kind of body guard to protect them' from
the natives, on their rout to the sea board.
The captain with a contemptuos smile
heard him, and replied, that they should all
feel themselves under infinite obligations
to his commander for furnishing sch a
formidable eseert, and added, that thoughh
they were yithoUt fears. of 4anger, it was
