THS VOLUME IS TO MY MOTHER.    PROEM. "ESLIE, the great painter, in his advice to his sister on authorship, says: "Truth never did, and never can do, harm; and I feel quite sure that the really moral writers are those who describe characters as they are, and not as the authors think they ought to be, or ought not to be. I am of opinion that the most instructive writers are those that lay open to our view human nature as it really is." Who that has ever made human nature a study fails to realize that there is a life, separate and distinct from its social exist- ence, which, cramped and restricted as it must necessarily be, affords little interest to the writer of fiction. Every writer. becomes an Asmodeus, and may present to the reader his characters under the added interest when event has stirred' to action that commands our admiration, or enlists our sym- pathy. While an author does not necessarily indorse the sentiments and opinions of his dramatis personce, it is his privilege to create an interest which need not attach to the commonplace, provided what he narrates sustains an appear- ance of verisimilitude. In this view, and with no desire to point a moral or adorn a tale, I have endeavored to sketch, in "Parolet"  and her father, the existence of that dual existence, which has, in them and their family history, found its actual prototype in real life. Hoping it may not prove without interest to the reader, their story is given to the public, by THE AUTHOR.     CONTENTS.

CHAPTER I. THE RECTOR'S DEFECTION. "The heart of the rulers is sick, and the High Priest covers his head. .... The sword is made keen; the iron has opened its mouth. The corn is red, that was green; it is bound for the sheaves of the South." THE office of minister in a country neighborhood is no sinecure; particularly where it is made up of elements es- sentially and constitutionally unorthodox. It is a mistaken idea which sends to country vacancies the lesser lights of public oratory; for I believe I am not mistaken in asserting that more characters are- to be found in the narrow limits of a country neighborhood than in a congregation of twice the size in a city. It is the countiy-people who make the most unsparing critics; and happy the clergyman who'es- capes unscathed through the fiery ordeal of a first year's pro- bation in a country parish. After that, a feeling of proprie- torship comes in to strengthen his cause; but, until then, it requires tact of no ordinary degree to reconcile himself to the vexed questions of High or Low Church, orthodoxy or unorthodoxy ;-questions which have affected the Church institutions of our land; institutions which are fast losing the primitive character of republicanism, and are sweeping onward with the march of progressive improvement toward the more intense interest of a Church oligarchy. These questions were mooted angrily after the opening of the war among political and state dogmas; and the quiet dignity of the American Church did not sustain itself ,    6         IN A CRUCIBLE. amid the thunders of revolution, while it became, subse- quently, a task requiring the highest ingenuity of political Churchmen to ravel the web of difficulties which they had woven in the union of secular and ecclesiastical power,-a union totally at variance with the character of the Ameri- can peoples, whose constitutional idiosyncrasies, rather than any defect of government, would preclude its feasibility., Among the ranks of Northern and Southern clergy were' some few who, holding aloof from the vexed questions of the hour, took the ground that the Church could have .no participation in faction or State treason, and were content quietly to pursue the peaceful avocations of their profession in those paths where the opening of the war found them. Yet I doubt if their line of duty was not the most arduous they could possibly have hit upon; and placed them upon almost the footing held by the Neutral States in the Great Contest. How preach the gospel of"Peace on earth and good-will toward men" to a people whose passions rendered them blind and deaf to the higher law of religion? How avoid shipwreck, when one day found them clinging to the rock of Secession, the next, floating wide upon the sea of Northern fanaticism? -a It was a difficulty which the- clergy. could not avoid, had they been so disposed. It was thrust upon them, however reluctantly. The people in all sections looked anxiously for some revelation of their minister's po- litical bias; and it was vain for the most simple-minded to set themselves against the tide. It became, then, a matter of conscience, or policy, that the minister should face this broad worldly question that involved so much: much to himself, as man; more, as minister.         ? Perhaps to none in the diocese of his State did it present I itself under a more vexed form than to the Rev. Arthur  Moreton, Rector of St. Philip's Church of K Parish. i   IN A CRUCIBLE.          7 Whether family or social reasons governed him, he had no wish to make them public; and while his congregation sat -Sabbath after Sabbath listening impatiently to doctrinal sermons, and wondering whether their confidence in their minister had been misplaced, the Rector suddenly relieved their apprehensions in a manner as surprising as the most earnest sensation-lover among them could desire. No evi- dence of the inward struggle betrayed itself in his quiet demeanor and unfaltering voice, when he delivered what, he must have felt, was his farewell sermon. Word by word he went over the debatable ground, and without further preamble stated his conscientious belief that it was a ques- tion which was out of the pale of ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and that, in future, he must dedline to make any mention:' of secular affairs from his pulpit. There -was an ominous hush, when the uplifted hand closed the morning service, upon the unmistakable evidence of their Rector's defec- tion. If the minister was conscientious in the grounds he took, his little congregation were no less so. They could not sit under a minister who declined to alter the ritual; and glances expressive of surprise, indignation, and something very like contempt followed the form of the priest, as he slowly descended the pulpit-stairs, and the vestry-door closed upon him. There were few dissenting voices in the clamor raised against him, when the congregation poured forth into the sunny churchyard; a clamor only hushed, when, with a sudden toning down, they recognized his presence among them. He was a man not entitled to be called elderly, yetwith a staid gravity of demeanor which, perfectly natural, was not out of keeping with his profession, or with his height and breadth. His face bore no stamp of any very high   8         IN A CRUCIBLE. order of genius, nor would he have been so classed amongr men of first-rate ability. Yet it was a good face, with earnestness of purpose written in the dark blue eye, and firmness in the strong curves of the lips, and the heavy mould of the square chin. The whole build of the face and figure was a trifle too square and stolid; yet, without pre- tension to beauty, he impressed one favorably. There was something in the face inviting trust; and looking upon it now, after listening to the avowal of a few moments before, the good people of K-- felt themselves singularly ag- grieved in this very matter. He did not pause, as usual, to exchange greetings, but, slightly raising his hat from his brow, passed with a filrm stride througli the agitated crowd, and entering the streets of the little village, made his way back to his lodgings. They were not more inviting in appearance than are usu- ally to be found in a country village; and a man of more refined taste might have shrunk from such homely sur- roundings. But the Rev. Arthur Moreton had left a luxu- rious rectorship, and the delights of a city parsonage, to assume the humble rectorship of St. Philips; and having o resolutely set his hand to the plough, gave himself up to no idle repinings after the fleshpots of Egypt. If his appearance was somewhat against any belief in X his rigid asceticism, that appearance was as rigidly belied ' by his simple habits; and the whilom priest of the highest sanctuary in the bosom of the highest Church, drew his own tea contentedly in an earthen teapot, in Mrs. Burton's first- floor lodgings in K----village. But, on this particular day, the Rector seemed unwontedly annoyed by the stifling atmosphere of his limited lodgings, as he walked to and fro in the interval between service, conning an open letter with  a face from which all quiet serenity had fled. It was upon receipt of this letter that the Rev. Mr. Moreton had   IN A CRUCIBLE.          f concluded to make the long-expected revelation of himself; and, though fullyl anticipating its results, he had, neverthe- less, felt no small share of annoyance. He was very well aware of the state of feeling he had aroused; well aware, too, of what had been expected of him; and though he had acted from conscientious 'motives and a severe conviction of duty, it will be seen that he felt littleof that soothing sense of contentment which moralists would lead us to believe treads upon the footsteps of duty fulfilled. It was no light matter to him that he had placed himself in a false position in the eyes of his people. . His people! He remembered well that first year among them, when he had fought down their prejudices, reconciled their differences, and listened with praiseworthy patience to their unmeaning tirades upon Church matters, of which they were totally ig- norant. Every country clergyman knows what this ordeal is: how much of the pride that pertaineth to the flesh- must be trampled under foot; how easily mistaken for proper self- respect. And, after fighting his way valianly into their hearts and their confidence, to turn suddenly and desert them! It was a severer test of courage than was required of him when he swam nearly the breadth of the Mississippi to save hischum's life, long years before. He glanced at the letteirr his handand, nd revived his recollections of the struggle w n his thews and sinews had done him good service, until he laid the insensible form of his friend on the sward, and sank, half-fainting, beside him: greater courage than it would require now to join the ranks of either army, and fight it out. That was a solution of the question much more within the range of the Rector's ethics, and much more too to his taste, than fighting against shadows--im- palpable mists, where his vision too often misled him, and he lost his consciousness of right. 1*   10         IN A CRUCIBLE. ' It had been almost a folly in him to appeal to any one else; and yet he had remembered Allan Fenwick's straight- forward way of cutting through difficulties, and had dropped him a hint of his troubles; and by return of post he held in his hand his friend's reply, which, he felt, was not a solu- tion which he could accept. He smiled as he glanced at the rapid scrawl, finished just in time to catch the post; and his smile deepened into a tender gravity as his eye lingered on the well-known signa- ture. "Rather too nice in its shades for Allan to deal with," he said; " it was not quite fair on my part." Yet, if the letter was no solution to Mr. Moreton's troubles, it was a decided answer to part of his letter, and led to an immediate decision on his part, ending in results which we have already seen. It was the second reading of Allan Fenwick's letter which occupied Mr. Moreton; and again and again the worry died out of his face, and the smile lingered broadly as he brought his reading to a close, placed' his hand over the open pages, seated himself by the table, and bent his head down on his arm in an attitude of thought. If Allan's letter had done no more, it had led him away from his trouble to pleasanter thoughts of Allan himself. It was so exact a representation of the man; and, though long years had passed since he had looked into those eyes that opened gratefully on his after that long swoon, he had never quite forgotten tfie little tremor it had brought to his stout frame, or the tender grasp in which he had held the uncon- scious form, with the chestnut-covered head resting against his shoulder. Once again he turned to the letter. It expressed no sur- prise at hearing from him once more, and, without pream- ble of any kind, went straight to the pith of the matter:   IN A CRUCIBLR.         " MY DEAR FELLOW: "Your Gordian knot seems to Fetan easy thing enough. I cut right straight through it; and here my ultimatum rests upon strictly ecclesiastical grounds. I look upon the war as one waged ageainst Puritanism, and for slavery, which is right, to me, in a religious point of view; and for which we can find as much scriptural authority as would satisfy the conscience of any decent clergyman. "As to what view politicians take of the war, that does not concern us. We are only bound to view it from a re- ligious stand-point; and it is clearly a religious war, with which the clergy have had as much to do, right or wrong, as any one. Therefore, old fellow, I take it we are not to shirk outr share of the responsibility; and when it comes to for or against abolition preachers, I am decidedly against. You see, I have no scruples. I am quite conscientious in saying this; and if you have determined to stick to the ritual, and your congregation th0owr you over, I am will- ing, with properi authority for so doing, to take your place. While I am in the character of mentor, though, I would say, think twice before you decide. "Yours till death, "A. FENWICK." Now, Mr. Moreton was very well aware that all his think- ing had been done previous to writing his letter; and that his decision had followed speedily upon his thought; yet he had been guilty of the weakness of shirking any entire self-dependence. Allan Fenwick could scarcely have been guilty of greater precipitation himself, than that with which Mr. Moreton acted upon his letter. It seemed to have been a stimulus to just the contrary direction from what the writer in- tended. Arthur's hurriedly despatched letter brought    12         IX A CRUCIBLE. Fenwick down by the middle of the week; and the two friends drew comfortably around Arthur's little tea-table, to discuss the new Rector's responsibilities. They seemed to sit lightly enough upon the new incum- bent, if one might judge from the careless, good-humored smile with which he listened to his friend's quiet remarks; while he watched, with a comical expression of amusement, Arthur's clumsy offices at the little table. "One thing at a time, Arthur," he said: "let parish matters alone until we have had our tea, or the contents of that boiling kettle will be interfering with my duties as Rector. Men are not intended for such work, and I mar- vel St. Paul should commend us to celibacy." The speaker was Arthur's senior by some two or three years; but his careless bonhommie and more youthful ap- pearance belied his seniority in years. You would scarcely have dwelt twice upon Allan Fenwick's face, had it crossed you among countless others in the thoroughfares of busi- ness or the highways of social life; yet now, lighted with a smile, half comic, half serious, as he met Arthur's rebuking nod, it was worth more than a second glance. Frank, and smiling with a careless grace that sat becomingly on his slender form, and with the high-bred cast belonging to del- icate features, Allan was not a bad representative of South- ern gentlemen. He put away his profession with his sur- plice; and as he sat half-balanced on the arm of the chair, sipping his tea from the heavy cups into which his host had poured the untempting beverage, one would have pro- nounced him decidedly handsome. i He was quite earnest in his choice of a profession; and the sick and needy of his parish had reason to bless him who had so often brought his simple, straightforward ener- gies to the task of ministering unto them. He could be quite, serious on occasion, and his careless, good-humored   IN A CRUCIBLE.         13 drollery rarely sank into frivolity or levity. He became rather grave while he sat there looking ruefully around Ar- thur's humble room,--at the uninviting couch which he was to share with his friend, and, lastly, at the homely appurte- nances of the tea-tray--and remembered that -he was to suc- ceed to these as well as to other parish belongings. Only courtesy restrained him from indulging in mental compari- sons between these and his own simple yet elegant lodg. ings, dainty cups, and solid silver service forwarded by his mother for his exclusive use; and he only assistant Rector in a parish not a great deal larger than the present one. But he ceased to think of all this when he looked on his firiend's 'face, and remembered what had been the spirit that led him here. His eyes rested lovingly and wistfully on the broad, homely face looking at him. across the table. The features had grown coarser, the thickset frame more stolid, the curves of the mouth and chin a shade more severe than the boyish face of that never-to-be-forgotten day. Yet, look- ing at it now, the same yearning came over Allan toward the stronger nature-the same half-bitter self-contempt. He bent forward, and startled Arthur in the act of raising his second cup to his lips, by laying his hand on his arm, and saying, half wistfully, half enthusiastically: "I'll tell you what, old boy, I'll draw my tea in that very teapot, and drink it out of these very cups, if it will bring me to what it has you-you, a Moreton of St. Bevins." He was too much in earnest to notice the deep, red flush that rose up on Arthur's dark face, and which seemed to in- dicate that hekwas not so unmindful of the heavy cups and dingy teapot as Allan imagined; and he, truly, a "More- ton of St. Bevins."   CHAPTER II. THE MORFETONS OF ST. BEVINS.  L One thus descended, ThAt hath beside well, in his person wrought To be set high in place."--Shakspeare. THERE were. any number of them, and all of one peculiar, unmistakable type: a peculiarity that came out strongly in feature and character. Proud, cold, reticent, they were yet chivalrous, with, perhaps, only the pride of birth; daring, with that courage built upon the length of the family pedigree, and that now asserted itself with just suf- ficient high-breeding to preserve it from insolence. These were the unmistakable characteristics. ,In feature, the family traits were even more unmistakable, in pale olive tints of complexion-sometimes, though not often, degen- erating into swarthiness, and always offering a singular contrast to eyes of a deep gray or blue: eyes that looked coldly and critically at you, and that were rarely seen to soften with the smile of lips full, scarlet, and perfect. The chiselling of brow, nose, and chin bore out the type of haut arzstocrate that was markedly perceptible in the small hands, feet, and ears. Finely formed, compact heads were set upon well-turned necks. The features were decided and i clearly defined, and were carried with undeviating same- ness through every variety of the Moretons-tall, short, slender, or stalwart. It was a singular cast of counte- nance: blending the strongest type of animal, sensual na- ture with the clearest form of the thorough-bred, intellect tual,-a type that forced itself upon you through every branch of the Moretons. "   IN A CPRUCIBJLE,        15 The brothers, seven in number, bore the alristocratic names of Chester, Dudleigh, Howard, Ralph, Cecil, Reginald, and Arthur. In the women, Helen, Constance, and Edith, the same traits, slightly modified, were yet as forcible; in feature, betraying superiority in the beauty of long, slen- der throats, and hands, and in a peculiar undulating mo- tion in gait. It would have seemed a sad misnomer had one of these swan-necked creatures answered to a name less euphonious. If the pride of the Molretons was offensive, it was difficult to say in what it betrayed itself. None ever heard a Moreton speak of himself or his family, their peculiarities, their likes or dislikes. Simple to severity in their habits, guiltless of ostentatious display of any kinds courteous in manner, they with excusable pride disclaimed any but the purely American blood that flowed in their veins. That purity of lineage forced itself upon you with a conviction stronger than any ocular proofs of genea- logical pedigree.* The seal-ring worn upon the third finger of Chester, the eldest brother, claimed simply to belong by right of family selection to the Moretons of St. Bevins, and to no hereditary claims of foreign ancestral escutcheon. See them when and where you might, involuntarily the old motto of the proud race of Rohan seemed not unfitting: "Roi ne puis,PrKnce ne deignza, Rohan je suis!" In Arthur, the intermediate brother, the type seemed only saved in the poise of the head, and in the fine, clear curves of the lips; and, with the absence of the family traits, it appeared scarcely out of keeping that the charac- teristics of the family were, also, in many respects wanting. Yret, if the Moretons themselves presumed upon this. prob- ability in combating his predilection for. the ministry, they were speedily convinced of their error. Arthur's per- sistency in the face of ridicule, sarcasm, and even more strenuously urged opposition, proved him not lacking in   1 6         IN A CRUCIBLE. determination. Their -pride of family, already weakened by Arthur's personal non-conformity to the family type, vented itself in bitter invective against him when he still further vindicated his right of choice by relinquishing the duties of St. Bevins, and assuming the humble Rectorship of St. Philips. The family alienation had, perhaps, been of great assistance to the Rev. Mr. Moreton in his effort to put aside all pride of birth and family in the duties of his calling; while he had, nevertheless, a conscientious belief that it was the very highest in life. The Moretons, if un- ambitious of political or professional life, would never have been anything less than gentlemen; and Arthur, in his dingy lodgings was, despite his stolid person and unaristo- eratic countenance, nevertheless a Moreton in all that per- tained to their prerogative of gentleman. We have no personal interest in any of the Moretons save Arthur, and Reginald, the youngest brother. Of Reginald no minute description is needed. Suffice it to say, that in personnel he was decidedly the Moreton of St. Bevins. Finer in feature, expression, and general cast, and with the additional beauty of hand belonging to the female AMoretons. He was rather below medium height, but with well-turned limbs, fine carriage and athletic frame. In character he was not greatly unlike the other brothers; and, with slightly varying shades, their names were their strongest distinctive differences. If there was anything further noticeable in Reginald, it may speedily be summed up in his life up to the present date. Beginlning with his college career, he had entered as freshman, and had, by rare chance or a stroke of singular genius, failed, in school-boy parlance, in " finding his-level." Wrapping himself in impenetrable reserve, he had passed without difficulty through his collegiate course, little known, less cared for, except as a source of pride to the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         1 institute; and had finished his career as sophomore, bear ing off the first honors of his class, and the warmest enco minms of the Professors. He had borne his honors, no meekly, but with a high hand; and the enthusiastic con gratulations of his fellow-students were received with a coolness that wonderfully tempered their ardor. Even the commendations of the Dons failed to excite any sympa thetic evidences in the youthful hero, whose closing hour: of college-life were free from all agitations of severec friendships, and whose self-congratulations, if he felt any were rigidly guarded from scrutinizing glances in the soli tude of his own chamber. Thence he only emerged in time to catch the latest train for home. If the Moretons were without ambition, inferences of a different nature might be drawn regarding Reginald from the date of this, his first triumph in life. Had he anticipa ted or desired sympathy at home, he would have beet sorely disappointed at their cool comments on the little par agraph devoted to the senior graduate in a notice of the closing term of college. He had gone directly to his mother's room, where he found Edith; received from both a cool kiss, and brief mention of his success, and their ap proval-and no more. Yet it was quite as much as he had expected. They had certainly not been in his mind at any time during the long struggle for honors coveted solely fo] self; and no thought of their gratified pride had mingled with the sweets of a first success snatched from eager,-envi ous competitors. It was something to him that he bore away the prize with, seemingly, little effort, for which the] had toiled and panted like prize-fighters in a ring; and hit gentlemanly composure was provokingly unruffled to the end. That his family received his success as a foregone conclusion, arguing simply upon the premise that- a More ton could accomplish anything which he had energy   18         IN A CRUCIBLE. enough to undertake, did not surprise him. Indeed, some such self-consciousness had sustained him all through. After a few months of quiet relaxation at St. Bevins, he had signified- his intention to Chester of entering some pro- fession; a disclosure which the eldest brother, the head of the family, had received with a quiet shrug, indicative of surprise that a Moreton should feel it incumbent upon him to assert his prerogative of intellect. Edith had put her slender hand upon his shoulder for a moment, saying, in her clear, musical voice, "I hope you will succeed as well in your professional, as you have in your college career, Reginald." Small encouragement; yet he had succeeded: not tearing his second triumph so quietly, though he struggled hard to conceal from other eyes any evidence of gratified ambition. The fruit of which he had tasted was intoxicating; and with its strong, sweet savor, came a sense that the tide of event stirred within him, that the triumphs of life, the race for its goals, was more in keeping with his strong spirit than the idle, lounging life at St. Bevins. He was very quiet. Failure, or its faintest chances, was not in his calculations. He looked well and widely, to strike deeply and surely. He had no confidant, and jealously guarded against any revelation which might betray the tendencies of his ambition. Nothing had offered itself up to the present time; and the family at St. Bevins had waited as patiently upon Reginald, as the K---  peo- ple upon Arthur, for some revelation. He was the one un- married Moreton, besides Arthur, whose profession was suf- ficient excuse, had he desired one, for his failure in any active participation on the theatre of events.       Month after month rolled by.  The Moretons were too  ; well aware what was expected of them, not to make an open declaration of the family politics; and, while the brothers evaded any active participation in the cotflict,   * IN A CRUCLBLE.         19 they had succeeded in leaving upon the public mind a favorable impression, of their loyalty to the Southern Cause, and their reliability in any patriotic moves set on foot within the parish. Reginald had studiously avoided any controversy which would render a discussion of his plans necessary. While Constance and Edith embroidered banners and stitched have- locks, he knew they were regarding his inertness with dis- mayed apprehensions. The matter could not continue on such a footing; and Edith, who generally ventured most with Reginald, broached the subject.. Before relating the interview which took place in the drawing-room at St. Bevins, it will be as well to refer to an occurrence in Reginald's life, in the interim between his college days and the opening of the war. A time when, between himself and one scarcely more than an acquaint- ance, yet with whose reputation as a duellist he was quite familiar, words had arisen, and Reginald's habitual cool- ness forsaking him, he had walked deliberately across the room and slapped his antagonist's face. After which, he had gone home only to saunter out at sunrise the next , morning to keep his appointment with his adversary. He had been carried back again with his right arm shattered at the shoulder, with only the faint satisfaction of leaving his adversary in a much worse condition. Here he experi- enced, for the first time, some of the sweets of sympathy, when Edith's terror-stricken face met him at the thresh- old, and her womanly fingers deftly bound the broken limb. After stating this little episode, we will return to the gas- lights at St. Bevins, under which Edith paced when she hesitatingly urged her query: "Do you intend going into the army, Reginald? Of course you are a Secessionist; we all are."     20         iN A CRUCIBLE. "I shall not go until I am needed, and I am not a Seces- sionist; but I am-a Southerner, and that comes to pretty much the same thing, I take it." Edith stopped her pacing, stood still under the lights, and said, with just a shade of temper in her pretty voice: "Not go until you are wanted! And run the risk of being called coward and poltroon: as well not go ,at all." She was a woman, and a very pretty one, standing now under the warm flush of light, her fair curls thrown back, and the angry gleam in her blue eyes. The slender form had ceased its graceful movement to and fro, and the deli- cate foot was pressed impatiently over the bright roses in the carpet. Very haughty and handsome and disdainful she was, her scarlet lips curving with an unrestrained move- ment of contempt. Reginald left his place by the mantel, came close .up to her, and said: "See here, Edith-I shall not go a moment sooner for any taunts of yours; and when you brand me coward and poltroon, it would be as well to remember that I move at my own free will: here is my exemption," and he touched his maimed arm significantly. "Even the Con- federate conscription cannot get around that. As for cow- ardice, let him think twice who would charge a Moreton with it. Our family reticence is not convenient, it seems, except to outsiders; but my political sentiments are not for your confiding ear, my pretty Edith;" and he laughed. His laugh was not his least attraction: generally low, soft, and musical, it yet had a singular facility of expression;. and that -which accompanied his words was not a pleasant one. For the moment Edith remembered only his taunting speech, and the aggravation of that musical cachinnation: yet a second thoutght followed his gesture toward the broken limb. She remembered his sufferings, the illuesi   IN A CRUCIBLE.         21 that had ensued, and through which she had nursed him, and relented. Relented only so- far as to forbear further words, for she turned sullenly from his courteous good- night, and her red lip pouted ominously. He had come off victor, and could afford to be courteous; the courtesy of the Moretons was always that of the victor to the vanquished. They bore defeat sullenly, and would bhave died under shame. She felt his repulse resentfully. He was her favorite brother, and sometimes she thought it worth her while to betray her interest in him in a lofty way. He had evinced his intention decidedly, to dispense with her sisterly ad- vice, as he generally did her patronage, and here the mat- ter ended.   CHAPTER  III. ARTHUR'S TEMPTATION. "Cloven apart, Flesh of his flesh, but heart of my heart; And deep in one is the bitter root, And sweet for one in the lifelong flower." HAVING seen that, with the absence of the Moreton fea- tures, Arthur had also been weighed and found wanting in the Moreton traits, it will be as well to give the reader some better idea of him than could be inferred from the brief no- tiee in the first chapter. ATe, like the other sons of the widowed Mrs. Moreton, had made his own selection of a school; and, somewhat to the surprise of the rest, had entered a Jesuit college at the age of fourteen, and there continued, without interrup- tion, his course of studies for seven years. During the whole of that time, their only knowledge of him was gained firom his brief visits during the early years of his student-life; and when these finally ceased, they learned, without surprise, his determination to enter the priesthood,'if, at the expiration of his college career, he had no cause to regret his decision.  That term, as we have seen, was a slow one. Arthur wanted the ability of his brothers, and the sys- tem of the college was not one to promote a rapid develop- ment.   Wht  occurred in the interim to alter his intention, did not transpire; but at the expiration of the seven years Arthur returned home, and made no further mention of any desire to turn Romanist. Yet the bias of Catholicism clung toiim strongly enough to tincture his life and doctrines long after he had followed 22   IN A CRUCIBLE        - 23 up his early predilection for the ministry by assuming the vows of a clergyman- of the Protestant Church. With the vows of his 'ordination, Arthur took upon I himself others, to be kept with all the force of his strong, human will: vows to conquer the tide of carnal passions that seethed in the blood of his race, to war with heart and soul against the temptations of the flesh. He must be a bhigh-priest, or none at all; and his oath was against the assumption of any earthly ties that must come in between himself and his God. Possessing all the strength of will of the other Moretons, he had none of the prescience of success that belonged to their higher order of talent. With humble, prayerful deprecation, he assumed his high office; and the time, up to his thirtieth year, was spent at St. Bevins in a rigid, self-denying life, worthy of an anchorite: a warfare waged with an earnestness unde- monstrative, yet with a bitter determination that should have insured success. His long, unceasing vigils, and se- verely inflicted penances, left no evidence on the outer man.   The spirit, struggling and smouldering within, wrought nothing against the counter-current that pro- claimed itself, unrebuked in the heavy features broadening with years; and the increasing energy of character only asserted itself in added strength of muscle and sinew. Sadly discouraging as were the outward evidences of Ar- thur's struggles, the inner man had lost nothing in the contest. During the eighth year of his probationary life at St. Bevins a temptation presented itself, before which he un- hesitatingly relinquished the duties of his rectorship, and turned his attention to others more humble. If the strug- gle was one of more than ordinary moment, few were the wiser for it. Single-handed and alone, Arthur had fought   24   .IN A CRUCIBLE. the battle and conquered-so far as action went, and no further. He had fled the temptation in real terror, with a keen appreciation of the danger; yet he knew that in flight alone lay safety. He had an humbling sense that in the first real passion of his manhood had mingled the very lowest order of that passion. Throughout life some curse of circumstance seemed to follow him, and all his dogged resolution failed to conquer, His strength lay more in the flesh than in the spirit; his sympathies stirred strongest at its bidding, and in moments of- despondency he had felt how vain the summons to his weak, spiritual nature in the contest. It had shamed him that he had not been able to divest his passion of its grosser  attributes. His love had been "of the earth, earthy."' He did not deceive himself as to the fact. All her maid- X enly grace, her unconscious loveliness, had been robbed of its poetical attraction by the ugly taint of the Moreton blood; lowered, in him, as much as his outward type was lowered, from the level of his aristocratic ancestry. He had loved, suffered, and made no sign; and whether or not she had been utterly unconscious of his passion, he never knew.  That she had been of its nature, he felt sure; or she could never have lifted her clear, brown eyes to his in youthful confidences, or tempted him with her girlish freedoms. Child that she was in nature and in years, she could not divine that the soft, little hand, laid carelessly in his, in- flicted a pang of martyrdom on the grave, elderly man: too elderly for her seventeen years to puzzle over. She knew nothing of these things then. The instinct of the woman i often- faulty in the girl. :He tore himself from the subtle influence, and thought, triumphantly, that he had-nothing more to fear. She, not l   IN A CRUCIBLE.         25 her sex, had been his temptation. No other woman had the same power to move him, or ever would have. His nature was constant, and his back once turned upon the temptress, he had a right to some faith in the completeness of victory. He had heard nothing more of her. She had dropped as completely out of his life as if she had never been. How often the event which stirs a life to its core, dies out utterly, only to be recalled at some future time, and re- membered, bitterly or thankfully, as the turning-point of existence! Arthur had held little communication with St. Bevins up to the breaking out of the war. Edith's letters, coming at long intervals, were filled only with family matters. The Moretons rarely wrote of any but family matters, and he had been content with the wisdom of ignorance in all that concerned her. Allan's first question after the offensive teacups had been removed, had thrown him into some perplexity; suggest- ing another which, simple as it was, had never entered his mind: "Shall you return to St. Bevins?" Until then, he had never thought of himself at all. The outhreak of the rebellion 1 Id been another tempta- tion, as great almost as the first, and as sturdily resisted. What interest had he in worldly matters? None! none whatever. This had been his conscientious response, and he had studiously excluded it from his thoughts, holding to his honest endeavor to avoid the danger. It had been forced upon him; and however reluctantly, he did not shirk it. It was not in the man's nature to shirk danger of any kind. He had never avoided her, though every occasional meet- ing urged a renewal of fierce warfare; and his open reli- quishment had not admitted of misinterpretation. Had any now branded him with the oppressive epithet of Union- 2   26         - .-IN A CRUCIBLE. ism, they had, probably, made the greatest mistake of their -lives; and I venture to say that the Rev. Arthur Moreton was as good a Southern man as any who stood in the ranks of the Southern army, and, sword in hand, vindicated his right of secession. He was true to the cause, without self- consciousness; but he was not, therefore, less true; feeling, however, that it was something in which he had neither art nor part. He had waited for some indication which was more po-  tent with him tfan any arm of either secular or ecclesiasti- cal power; but that voice had been mute. He would have obeyed its faintest whisper with the blind reliance charac- teristic of him, following it up with all the strength of his i bodily organization. Remaining, as it did, silent, he had rested his decision there, and acted accordingly. His faith was in prayer. If there was no efficacy in prayer, his vocation was at an end. Resting his -bead on his elbow, he had occupied the next hour or two after Allan's query in trying to convey some idea of all this to his friend. Without naming her, or the reason of his relinquishment of St. Bevins, he had let Allan into enough of his state of mind to arouse him out of his lazy contentment, and startle him into zealous controversy. "Good heavens, Arthur! do -you mean me to believe you in earnest? Women have nothing to do with our daily lives! My good fellow, when we assume the minis- try, do we conveniently drop the serpent's skin, shake off ;at will the troublesome vehicle of mortality, and become beneficently endowed with all angelic attributes except the wings? My poor fellow, our outward man will assert the interest Satan claims in the fair inheritance of Eden, and since we cannot utterly deny our manhood, why, let us 'elevate it as much as we can, by contact with the finer nature of woman."   IN A CRUCIBL  . E2 Baffled and disappointed, Arthur was silent.. Each ac- cepted the teachings of the nature with which they were endowed. Fenwick's was not only the more attractive, but the better nature, and Arthur knew it. To Fenwick, woman appeared not under the form of a temptress, but as a co-worker and ministress, and the best gift of God's providence: co-worker in all things: co-equal, save in her weakness, which was the strongest appeal to his sympathy. Investing woman with all his own purity of mind, he was yet not unmindful of the subtle influence of sex; and would, as likely as not, have fallen into a sin from which Arthur would only escape ate the cost of all that was best and brightest in his nature. Aye, and he would rise from the sloth of that sin with a repentance quite -as earnest as was needful, and be none the worse for this undeniable instance of his own weakness. He was only a man, striv- ing with all possible earnestness against sin, the world, and the devil: with all the chances in favor of failure, yet per- sistently determined to assert his right to success. Long after Fenwick had retired, Mr. Moreton sat lost in thought, revolving in his mind the questions to which their conversation had given rise. He had but a poor opinion of himself, yet he was too much accustomed to rely upon his own judgment to ques- tion its fallibility in this instance. He was no more dis- posed to adopt Fenwick's views, than to change natures with him. Much might be said in Arthur's defence. The Moretons had not made good family men.  It was scarcely the ma- terial from which much was to be expected in that line; and had Arthur assumed any other profession, or adhered any less rigidly to his self-imposed restrictions, his views might have been no less lateral. Whatever surmise mighbt be entertained on that head, it had been, as we have seen, , - .*   58  -'IN A CRUCIBLE,. not subjected to any of the ordinary tests; yet it was not a matter of marvel if, in the first dawning passion of man-, hood, the base alloy of the family blood leapt all the bar- riers of restrictio,. Referring to the question of his return to St. Bevins, he suddenly remembered the arrival of Edith's semi-monthly epistle, thrust unopened into a drawer, and forgotten until that moment. It was a plain, neat, ladylike epistle, writ- ten upon spotless paper, carefully folded into the dainty envelope, and guiltless of perfume, which Edith would have considered a vulgarity.  The fair, sloping letters were clearly traced, and the whole character of the letter was one from which you would scarcely have expected strong epithets or unladylike strictures: yet it was not without both. Arthur smiled, as he read the closely written sheets filled, from  first to last, with MIoreton news. Only at the close he became intensely interested, at an allusion which nearly concerned himself: "I cannot think," she wrote, 'what glamour can have come over you and Re]ginald.  He, after waiting until our patience was quite exhausted, coolly tells us he ' shall not go until he is wanted.' In other words, until a conscription is enforced; and one scarcely cares whether he goes or not, so little is it to the family honor. It does seem to me, that were I a- man, pride would drive me to this thing, if noth- ing better, I am not sure that I  am  really patriotic; buit then, if we do not act worthily, it is certainly reprehensible to a greater degree than in persons whose stations in life are more humble--noblesse oblqge. As    to Reginald pro. voked as I am at his conduct, I know I should be perfectly miserable were he to leave. He is my favorite brother, and of course I could least spare him: yet, if he stays at home, I shall be so ashamed of him, that I  am qnite sure I  should    IN A CRUCIBLE.        -29 not love him. I remonstrated, and, as usual, came out worsted. His banter is insufferable; and his laugh a thou- sand times worse than an insult. "You will scarcely credit it, when I tell you, that Ralph has raised a battalion, and gone to the seat of war: in sheer desperation, I do believe, to save the family credit. Reginald sneers at Ralph's having rank; but I am inclined to think he is waiting for something of the kind himself. He is inordinately ambitious: something so little, be- longing to the male Moretons, that it rather excites my admiration. By the way, Reginald has made some talk lately of joining Captain Trevor's command. Do you know anything of him? He was in the Crimean war, and did something desperate, I believe. Reginald laughs at this, and says he goes with Trevor only because be likes him; but I don't believe it. s I did hear, too, that he had married that Chandos girl, who, if you remember, was something quite out of the com- mon. She married, I believe, about a year after you left St. Bevins. At that time, we took very little interest be- yond teasing Reginald, who had shown some fancy for her; an honor which it seems she, did not properly appreciate. I do not know where the Trevors are living; but at present they are in the city, where Rege will join them, if he de- termines to enlist. Come up and bid him good-bye, and see if you can find out what he is driving at. Constance pre- tends great indifference as to his movements, but I know she is really as anxious as I am. It is too bad to know so little of one's own brother; and I do think I am somewhat entitled to Rege's confidence. I pity his wife, should he ever marry, if she be a woman of any spirit. ' Con. is terribly worried about some report that is in circulation here, of your having avowed Union sentiments, and being turned out of your rectory. If this is so, we are \   30         IN A CRUCIBLE. a doomed family, and I shall change my name in self defence. There was no sense in your ever leaving St. Bevins, for it was quite a matter of pride, after the first shock, to sit under a minister out of the family, in a church built by a Moreton., If you have relinquished St. Philips, from any motive-and I am sure there is no saying what you would not do-come back here. Your vacancy has never been filled; and, indeed, it was always supernumerary, the du. ties not being more than one could have performed. "Helen's child will be christened Moreton. Who can so well perform the office as yourself? She bids me say so." He closed the letter, after referring again and again to the matter of the Trevors. He could now return to St. Bevins: indeed, where else could he go? His ministerial . duties, for the present, were in abeyance-he thought,    sadly. The decision had been made conscientiously; but it was too painful to seek a renewal. The danger was over.     She had left St. Bevins, and, more than all, was married.  She was lost to him as effectually as if death had snatched  her from him. There was little need to question the matter. Under no circumstances could he have claimed her; yet, i after a few moments of silent sffering, with closed eyes ,! and lips whose tremulous motion was 'painfully evident, Arthur felt what a strong barrier that marriage-tie was, and rejoiced at it. Rejoiced, though he wandered on wistfully 'to a thought of whether the marriage was a happy one. He hoped it was: he could scarcely have borne the thought i of her unhappiness. This brought him to Edith's reference to Reginald's fancy for her. Was it so? He had never guessed it; but then he had known very little of this youngest brother; and, shame to say, cared'very little. Yet, if Reginald too had   .   IN A CRUCIBLE.        331 loved this woman--loved, and suffered as he had, was it inot some tie between them? Heawas going off, perhaps never to return, and Arthur's heart softened with something nearer like family affection than anything he had ever kno5(n. He possessed little of the family pride of the other More- tons, but he felt quite certain that Reginald would act wor. thily. He would return, see himn, and learn how and when he would leave. So thinking, he began hastily thrusting his things into a portmanteau; then, as suddenly remembered his promise to his friend to hear his first sermon in the parish, and the lateness of the hour, and satdown again. He had no further thought now of his love. It was his custom to devote iis last waking thoughts to serious subjects; and he calmed himself down with the ease of habitual self-restraint, his face softening and growing sweet, despite its manliness. If it was a mistaken life, one would fail to realize it thus, seeing what a trustful worthiness lay within, and what a power of happiness it contained for himself and others.  .. .        . S ' . D   CHAPTER IV. ALLAN FENWICK'S SERMON. "I come, not to preach Peace, but the Sword." IT was no light trial to Arthur to sit among his congre- gation, and see his pulpit usurped by another, though that other was his best friend., Yet he did sit there, with his good, stolid face settled into enviable composure, and betraying nothing of the dis. may with which he heard the text of his friend's discourse. He raised his head to catch the clear tones: "I come, not to preach peace, but the sword." He was startled out of his composure-completely startled! He had almost a mind to cry "Stop!"Did it form any part of his duty to sit quietly there while his people were led astray? Could -any conscientious clergyman of the Established Church preach a sermon on such a text?  Where was his au- thority? Before the words died on Allan's lips, Arthur determined that he must lose his friend rather than leave his people in such hands. In the silence that reigned after the delivery of the text, he raised his eyes to the pulpit. Allan had closed his hand on the few slips of paper containing his notes, and leaned forward, his eye resting, not upon Arthur, but looking straight forward into the faces before him. Involuntarily, Arthur turned from the face of the priest,  the delicate, earnest face, flushed with the faintest tinge of repressed em6tion, and- followed the direction of the blue eyes to those of the congregation. Upon one and all, in every variety of expression, he could trace but one' feeling-- a, feeling so strong that his heart sank. Had his self-control 32 I'.             IN A CRUCIBLE.         33 forsaken him, he would have bowed his head in very an- guish of spirit. He had been sufficiently agitated to lose the first words of the discourse, and had almost determined not to listen; but in spite of himself he could hear the sweet tones of Fenwick, hesitating at first, growing clear and ringing as he proceeded. Then Arthur felt, rather than saw, how he swayed the sympathies of his auditors; nor could he mar- vel. He could never have given such a rendering of the text. In the pulpit he beheld the priest, speaking as " one having authority," referring to one greater than he, who had gone forth to strike with the " sword of Gideon and of the Lord,"--their Bishop, whose authority over the clergy within his own diocese none could dispute. Without questioning the scruples of another, conscien- tious, no doubt, he considered the pastoral letter addressed to them sufficient authority for altering the ritual. But they needed no authority. Blindly, unquestioningly, they would have followed the prophetic voice of the priest, the prophetic fire burning in his bright, clear eyes. Even Ar- thur could not question his sincerity. He felt, rather hum- bly and reproachfully, that he had set himself against the wisdom of his superiors. Yet he, too, had been sincere; sincere, without the power to impress them with it, as Al- lan had. 'His long habit of self-control and of austere re- pression of emotion, had quelled the eloquence of the tongue. He felt, with a deep, bitter irony, how slight a thing public opinion was. He knew himself a worthier man than Fenwick, a- stronger Christian, a truer priest; yet he. despaired of ever impressing this upon any one.  He thought, half sullenly, that it was not worth his while to try. He was thinking of Allan only as he was, in the inti- macy of their daily lives; as of one who often and thought- 2*   34         IN A CRUCIBLE. lessly laid his careless head upon the pillow, not remembering to seek the strength, without which, his own nature fainted. He saw him now assuming the office of teacher, impressing his priesthood with a force that seemed irresistible. Better thoughts came as he listened to the closing of that electric sermon, when he heard the sweet tones gently al- laying the fire of righteous indignation that had stirred at his bidding. If the sword was righteous, it was not mer- ciless; and he who could fearlessly petition the God of battles to smite, gently prayed that the Spirit of peace might descend, with His blessing, upon the just and the unjust. When the slender hand was raised in benediction, Arthur saw on the fair face, with eyes closed and lips apart, only peace; the "peace that passeth human understanding;" and he felt that, however inscrutable to him, it was a life blessed in its calling. He had been brought to acknowledge this in spite of him- self; yet he shrank from the appealing touch of his friend's arm. Seeing, however, that his silence pained Fenwick, he said, slowly: "I did not go to criticise you, Allan; I of course felt some anxiety as to your reception; but that feeling, it seems, was quite causeless." If this was said a little' bitterly, it may be pardoned him, knowing how deeply interested he had been in his people. Allan forgave it readily. -"I hope you know how thoroughly in earnest I am; Ar- thur," he said, after a momentary pause; then, a little wist- fully, "You will feel safe in trusting them with me," *  Could Arthur have remembered only his old friendship, he would have given a ready answer to these words, their simplicity bringing their love so forcibly to him; but there was something more at stake than personal feeling, and he broke out impetuously:   IN A CRUCIBLE.         35 "I cannot say that, Allan. I do not question your sin- cerity; but I do not see that that matters much in a thing of this kind. They would be as likely to follow you whether you were sincere or not; and if it is wrong-" He paused, turned suddenly toward Fenwick, his face hardening into a painful intensity, and said, sharply: "My God!, -Allan,- the responsibility rests with me: with me, their pastor, who forsook them in this terrible "hour of trial. It is a terrible hour when all are led away by passion and excitement, and the teacher is as helpless as the taught." Fenwick was too much taken by surprise to make any response. He had never before believed half in Arthur's earnestness; but it was too apparent now, not to subdue even his light spirit. "I ought to have stuck to them. I need not have bid- den them take up the sword, but I might have done as I was bid," continued Arthur. He was struggling hard to condemn himself, and Allan, looking at him with a strong feeling of pity, saw his great, broad hand go up with an impatient gesture, once or twice, to wipe the moisture from his brow. He ceased speaking after a few moments, and stood looking out into the street. It was darkening into twilight, and lights were beguining to gleam fitfully from the scattered houses beyond the village. Allan could just trace the outlineS'of Arthur's stout form against the faint light from the window. He was not view- ing this matter seriously. He acted always more upon im- pulse than upon any theories of right- or wrong; and fortu-o nately his impulses, heretofore, had been good. There had been some little episodes in his clerical life, that would not bear too close a scrutiny; but he had come out of such scrapes with a very edifying penitence, and with so bum-   36         IN A CRUCIBLE. ble a self-deprecation, that his character had seemed rather bettered by it. After Arthur's outhurst, he had felt very sorry for him, and mindful of their friendship, had been revolving some scheme by which to relieve Arthur's sense of responsibility. Not being able to hit upon anly reasoning sound enough to satisfy Arthur's scruples, he followed an instinct, often . a happier expedient; and crossing the room, he laid his two white, womanly hands upon Arthur's shoulders, and facing him round, said: "I am not up to this thing, Arthur, perhaps; and that may be the reason our views differ; but on the other hand, as I don't feel bound to send these people to war, I will promise to preach no more sword-sermons. Will that sat- isfy you? The Bishop's pastoral is certainly sufficient au- thority for altering the ritual." Arthur was just in the frame of mind to listen patiently. He had wearied himself vainly with thought on a viery perplexing subject; and then the words were spoken in Allan's loving voice, with a half coaxing tone that had always had power-with him. With a slight returning pressure of the hands that lay with so much kindly force upon his shoulders, he said: "No, no, Allan! I cannot dictate to others. Preach what you like. You may be right, and I wrong; only I cannot take your word for it. I have waited for some man- ifestation; and until it is vouchsafed, I must remain idle." A smile, half sad, half quizzical, played around Allan's mouth as he said, caressingly: "I tell you, old boy, if you were not so much in earnest, I should laugh at you. You will be none the worse for a little rest; and now let me help you pack your portman- teau. I suppose you will take the six a..x; train to St. Bevins."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         37 Arthur yielded, leaning wearily back in his chair with closed eyes, while Allan went down on his knees before the open drawers and began his work, humming softly tho while. Oh! for the clasp of some womanly-hand, the sympathy of some womanly voice--her hand, and her voice! In all the world-there was no other for him. He could have sobbed his very heart out on her bosom, had she come tohim then. He was thinking of what might have been, had he met her before taking those vows upon himself. Few men had so deep a recognition of the sanctity of the marriage tie. He felt how sweet it would have been to have held her to his heart, to have called her wife.- Her face had never come before him in any other light. She could never have been anything to him save as wife. He had no more belief in platonic affection than any other man; and now he was giving himself up to the sweetness of a dangerous indulgence: was forgetting her marriage, or only remem- bering it to picture that wonderful face in her wifehood. Was it sweet and tender-looking at her husband as it had sometimes at him--with a strange unconsciousness of its power? Had it altered and lost its charm? He sat very quietly there, while his heart throbbed, and his eyes grew soft under their closed lashes. When Allan's work was over, the face of the siren was banished, and he came back to more kindly thoughts of his friend, the only one he had ever known. I   CHAPTER V. j   -    THE BROTHERS, "It is not much that a man can save On the sands of life, in the straits of time,     Who swims in sight of the third great wave That never a swimmer shall cross or climb.

THE day had been an unusually long one to Reginald, wearied as he was with a multiplicity of affairs, on this his last day at home: a trying one, too, to his nerves. Even the unloving Moretons had evinced some emotion; and he had found Edith's tears a test of his own composure. It had not forsaken him   throughout his interview with his mother, though he had hurried over it in some such fear. He had gone to his room early, desiring that Arthur might be sent to him on his arrival; and he now sat quietly watching the closing in of evening at St. Bevins. There was a soothing sense of quietude in the shadows that flung out broadly to the east, in the patches of golden light that flecked the landscape far and wide. How often his eyes had rested upon it!--yet never with quite the feel- ing that was struggling for expression on his handsome face now, handsomer for the softened seriousness of the eyes and lips. He had reason to be thoughtful: it was by far the most serious event in his life. He was older, now, by some years, than when he had looked death so carelessly in the face on that sunny summer-morning. He was obeying rather an honorable than a patriotic impulse. He had no ambitious tendencies for military   glory, and there was 38        e o   IN A CRUCIBLE.         39 more than the terrors of death to him in such a move. His tastes were aesthetic, his habits luxurious, and he looked with reluctance upon the hardships of a soldier's life. He passed from such thought to one of ldeeper moment: one that he had hitherto held but lightly. It was natural that it should come before him at such a moment. He was following, with his eye, the softly blending tints of autumn, the mellowing glory of the evening clouds-orange and purple floating overhead:. following it first with a half- unconscious -perception of its beauty, soon forgotten in musings of a far different nature, if one might judge from the flushing of the clear, olive cheek, the impatient curving of the full, scarlet lip. Had Edith been near then, her bright eyes might have drawn their own augury of the na- ture of the man. Proud, passionate, and daring,-not the daring of the brute, not the pride of birth or lineage; ambi- tious,-not for honors won with that brute strength which belonged to him as to the rest of the Moretons, and to which military life in his eyes seemed but the key,-but ambitions hardly earned, the triumphs of intellect, the pride of energy and will: these were the sweets of life to him: who could doubt it! Who could doubt, either, his suc- cess! There was on that young face, a power of control as impressive as the highest stamp of genius. If he had beauty, it was that of manhood in its highest perfection, possessing all the refinement of genius, as well as of high- breeding. His secret faded from his eyes as twilight descended. He had heard the murmur of voices that announced Arthur's arrival, and resumed his seat, waiting, without a shade of im- patience, his entrance. He had been gifted with no ordi- nary pride, and had found it very subservient to his interests in life; indeed, bad he been without it, a sense of its -se- fulness would have brought it speedily to his command.   40       -  -IN A CRUCIBLE. He had not to wait long in this instance; and as he rose and stepped forward, Arthur turned the knob of the door, flung it open somewhat hastily, and entered. Though each had felt no small share of eagerness for the interview, it was, for the first few moments, somewhat constrained. Neither could speak as they might, had there been any habit of mu- tual confidence. Reginald whs the fire to break the awk- wardness. 'He entered fully with Arthb into his business arrangements; and Arthur, though elergyman, had suffi- cient knowledge of such matters o listen, with no small degree of admiration, to the unfoldel plans of his younger brother. He had a very high regard for Reginald's talent, and perfect faith in his motives, though as yet none had been assigned. In his own slow, deliberate fashion, Regi- nald was at last brought to speak of these. "I have no ambition for military honors," he said; "if I hlave desired them at all, it has been more that I might avoid the hardships of a soldier's life, for which habit and inclination alike unfit me. None has been offered me"--ihere he colored slightly,-" yet my wealth and iAfluence could have procured it. I -may as well say at once, that I had too much pride to use either. I. shall do my duty as a pri- vate in the. ranks, simply from my pride as a gentleman: you will believe me fully when I disclaim any ambition to do more." He paused with a slight hesitancy, glancing at Arthur as he did so. Whether he was deceiving himself, or at- tempting to deceive Arthur, the latter could not deter- mine; but he felt some6 satisfaction in thinking, as he re- turned the glance, that, should occasion offer, he would do . much more. "I have not waited to be conscripted, as Edith said," he continued; "I have known from the first that the struggle would be a long one; that we would need all our strength;    IN A CRUCIBLE.         41 and I have not been hasty in offering my services with the first rush. I have no desire to make a useless sacrifice of my life, though I should not count the cost in. a mel6e." He raised his head, and the slow blood crept under the violet veins in his forehead. Arthur watched him with in- terest. He was listening anxiously for the rest: it came more slowly. "I may as well tell you, Arthur, that I have not been unmindfiul of the result; and that my own course has been somewhat guided thereby. I have no doubts as to our ulti- mate success. First, we have the secessionists, who will, nearly to a man, fight it out. Next, we have thousands who, like myself, are not secessionists, yet with whom it is a point of honor to go with their State, and will not flinch either: no, by-Heaven!- not sooner than the most rabid secessionist among them." There was a thrill of suppressed eagerness in, his voice, and Arthur bent forward with a sudden sympathy. "And you believe we will succeed?" he questioned. "I do!" There was another pause, somewhat longer than the first-; and again it was Reginald who broke the silence. '"There will be some interest after that, Arthur. Think what a career will be opened up to one who has-" He had said this slowly, yet with the same intonation of intense emotion; and Arthur, still looking at him, saw the flushing of his pale cheek, and a fire of unusual brightness in the handsome eyes. He took up the unfinished sentence: "to one who has gone through the war as a private, you would say." Reginald bowed his head in acquiescence. "Aye," continued Arthur, musingly; "a great field of worldly greatness for one in your station, and ambitious of political, or even professional life."   42         IN A CRUCIBLE. There was no reply, though he had framed his speech almost in the form of a question; yet the silence was suffi- ciently expressive. He sat very still, with his head bent back against the cushions: a very handsome one, Arthur thought, with his short, waving hair, and broad, open brow.  His curling, chestnut beard was pointed and trimmed, the moustache, of a lighter hue, half-concealing the beautifully moulded mouth, and his taper hand hung carelessly over the arm of the chair. All the passionate- utterance of the voice lingered on his face; and Arthur thought, half sadly, how young a life it was to be marred by a passion so blighting. So he deemed it; yet he felt how much any coldness or want of sympathy would jar upon Reginald in his present state, and refrained from speech. Yielding to an unusual impulse, he rested his broad hand with a slight pressure upon the slender one of his brother. A quick spasm passed over the face of the younger, before it settled to its, usual expression of haughty coldness. They did not separate immediately, but little more, con- versation passed between them. Arthur was thinking of Edith's letter; wondering how she could ever have refused such a man-how any woman could. Had she done so? He could not determine. He never dreamed of seeking to penetrate Reginald's secret. His own was sacred! He had always believed her to be ambitious, even in her girlhood: her marriage seemed some justification of his belief. Edith said her husband had distinguished himself in the Crimean war: doubtless her pride was gratified, and, he hoped, her love; yet he could not tell. Girls were apt to be led into dangerous errors. Had Reginald really loved her? Brought again to Reginald, he started into a more earnest interest. He was not diffident nor timid; yet he hesitated to question the man before him: it seemed almost a presumption.   IN A CRUCIBLE.        43 As if by some hidden sympathy, Reginald said: "There is one thing more, Arthur. Would you mind talking a little with me? I have not thought much of such things before, but perhaps it would be as well." "Yes," said Arthur, eagerly; "it is what I would so much wish."  Reginald was not eager-only very grave and quiet, lis- tening with respectful attention to the words of his brother, spoken, for the first time in all their intercourse, in a minis- terial capacity. After a little, he obeyed Arthur's gesture, and bent his haughty head with what humility he could summon. Then the brothers stood for a moment in silent parting un- der the gas-lights. At length Arthur moved slowly to- ward the door, Reginald following. When be gained the end of the hall and looked back, Reginald still stood in the lighted doorway, watching his receding footstep. Sad as this parting was, it was the most comforting hour Arthur bad ever known at St. Bevins.   CHAPTER VIL PAROLET. "Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water And the sea's gold in it. Bright heavy brows well gathered up White gloss and sheen; You have the face that suits a woman, For her soul's screen, The sort of beauty that's called human." Swinm, ne. THERE was little time given for further thought; and Reginald congratulated himself, as he drove rapidly through the lighted streets of the cit that he had left his cares at St. Bevins.  Evidences of military preparation met his eye at every turn. Gay young officers, in their jaunty uniforms, passed each other with hurried nods; bright-eyed women, with blue cockades on their shoulders and rebel flags on their bosoms, exchanged greetings with smiling faces. It was a pleasant picture, soon to be dashed with the darker shades; and though its brightness lifted the cloud from Reginald's brow, he was not thoughtless enough to forget what a sad chapter had already opened upon the history of the South. The- interruption to his meditations came in the shape of the sudden jerk with which the cab drew up in front of Capt. Trevor's door. Reginald paid his fare, dismissed the cabman, and leis. urely ascending the steps, rang the bell. The door was opened almost immediately, the servant saying, respects fully: "Mr. Moreton, I believe? You are expected, sir. My "   IN A CRUCIBLE.         45 master is out; but your room is prepared, and you will just have time to change your dress for dinner." He followed the servant into the comfortable room as- signed him, at the end of the hal, on the second floor. 'I have no further need of your services, my good fel- low," he said a little impatiently, as the man began un- packing his portmanteau. "I suppose I can find my own way to the drawing-room. At what hour did you say?" The man repeated his directions, and quietly withdrew, leaving Reginald- to make his toilet unaided, as he desired. It wanted some minutes of the dinner-hour when he de;- scended the stairs and entered the drawing-room. It was empty; and with a want of other occupation, rather than curiosity, Reginald surveyed the handsome apartment. If the Trevors were wealthy, they made little display of their wealth; yet plain, and simple as were the details, it was easy to see that the presiding spirit of the household was a woman of taste and refinement. The softened tints of the carpet and hangings were relieved by pictures and statuettes; and these, he noticed, exhibited a purity of selection, with which even his critical taste could find no fault. Flowers clusterd in rich vases on the mantel, and stood upon a marble tripod before the low french-windows. The cool quiet of the room was relieved by the careless arrangement of the low cushioned chairs and couches; and small marble-topped tables, conveniently scattered through the room, were covered with choice editions of standard works. A bright coal fire sent a warm glow over the room, and directed Reginald's eye to a portrait facing the en- trance, and toward which he stepped hastily. It was a likeness of Mrs. Trevor in her girlhood; a pretty face enough, with floating curls of a warm hue, and a sparkling vivacity of expression that had then made its chief attrac-   "        IN A CRUCIBLE. tion. He looked at it carelessly. She had never presented the same fascination to him as to Arthur, and the gossips of St. Bevins had been wrong in imputing to him any weakness for that "Chan'dos girl," as Edith had termed her. Yet the most indifferent observer would have pro- nounced such an epithet misapplied to the girlish face, smi- ling out of the fiame before him. The artist, or perhaps the sitter, had shown a graceful acquaintance with his art, in surrounding the youthful figure in a redundance of clear muslin, leaving the bare, plump shoulders and slender throat shaded by the loose, floating hair. The white of her robe contrasted with the clear, dark tint of the face, only relieved again by the bloom of the cheek. The dark, full eye and half-parted lips gave a thoughtful air to the countenance, without depriving it of that archness of ex- pression that is the type given to the Beatrice Cenci; not the pink-eyed, white-turbaned Beatrice of the scaffold, but Beatrice in her girlhood, before the beginning of that fear. ful tragedythat darkened her life. The countenance was well thrown out from a background of purple draperies, with a tint-of crimso" in the petals of a half-opened rose, lying loosely itn the rings of sunny hair. The hands held a half-open, illuminated missal, and the figure was in an attitude at once graceful, commanding, and languid. "If the artist planned such effects, he is a true one, be he whom he may-if the woman, she has an eye that needs only cultivation to make her a finished artist, or at any rate, one of no mean ability." "A high encomium, scarcely warranted by the facts," said a voice at his side; and turning, Reginald saw the original of the portrait. "I am glad you are reviving your recollections of old days at St. Bevins. It saves me the trouble of self-introduction-a ceremony at all times an awkward one."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         4 t It was a voice neither low nor soft, yet by no means unwomanly: rather clear and full, distinct in enunciation, and at whose slightest inflection might be gathered some- what of the sentiment of the speaker. It would be difficult to say in what the face had gained or lost since the date of the portrait overhead; yet it had changed infinitely. It was not beautiful, scarcely hand- some, yet with a ,great power of attraction in the broad, thoughtful brow and deepset eyes: a brow too broad for fe- male beauty, and from which the floating curls had been gathered away in deep waves of bronze. The eyes were large and bright, gray or brown in hue, with heavy curling lashes, and under which were traced dark circles, detract- ing again from the feminine beauty and softness of the face, while, taken in connection with the expanse of forehead, it gave an intellectual cast to the countenance. The lower part of the face was defective, with the single exception of the full, sweeping contour of the cheek and chin; and these were perfect, realizing the highest conception of the sculptor's art. The features were without that peculiar stamp of high-breeding that belonged to the female More- tons, nor was the classic moulding borne out in the head; yet it was, nevertheless, an aristocratic face, with the stamp, too, of a higher order of genius than sat upon the finely-cut features of Edith Moreton. The character of brow and eye was wonderfully borne out in the mouth, with the passion. ate curving of the scarlet, mobile lips. Arthur had not been far wrong in terming it a wonder- ful face; and, looking at it, one would turn instinctively to all their preconceived ideas of the rare faces of the olden time: faces impressing you with a blind sense of their power, blended, too, with a sense of their womanliness in the tender grace of aspect, the softened curves of lips which broke into smiles of rare sweetness.   48         IN A CRUCIBLE. The form was tall, full, somewhat voluptuous in contour, yet singularly light and graceful in build. The carriage was erect, the head well poised on a slender throat, whose waxen tinge was prettily discernible above the dark hue of her robe. The feet were small, with a well-arched instep that gave elasticity of motion; and the hands, also small, had slight, lissom fingers that closed softly around those they clasped with a singular power of sympathy. 'She had spoken with the easy grace of a woman of the world, waiting composedly for his reply; yet, for once, his ready courtesy seemed to forsake him. He had turned from the portrait to the woman at his side with an instinctive comparison of their merits, and had been surprised out of his usual well-bred composure, by the developments of time. If he had taken little note of the commonplace beauty of a girl of sixteen, he was brought to a far different estimate of the woman who looked at him in all the serene con- sciousness of her power and her attractions. Yet she was devoid of any evidence of undue vanity, and her manner was without coquetry, quiet, easy, and self-contained. "I am brought from my recollections of St. Bevins, to far pleasanter thoughts of the present, and a happy renewal of our former acquaintance," he said, bowing over the hand she extended. There was no further association in his mind with the "Chandos girl," or the commonplace picture overhead. They moved away, coming under the light, while she said: "Captain Trevor expected you, and will be in to dinner. I am glad you have taken service with him." The expression offended Reginald. He was measuring himself half-scornfully with the man whose service he was in; but he-only said: ( "I preferred going with one who had seen service, and knew his business. Trevor made a fine soldier."   'IN A CRUCIBLE.        49 Ah! That Crimean episode. For how much he has bee'(indebted to it!" He could not determine whether this was ironical or not. She had that cool, baffling manner that. answers the purpose of concealment equally with language. "You know all about it, then?" he questioned. "Yes; it was one of my father's favorite stories.- I have heard it often too from others. I cannot say the recital en- hanced the interest. The facts were enough, and language could only weaken. Details could hardly add to a thing of that kind." "Yet, would not silence in one's friends upon such a sub- iect appear in the light of a desire to withhold a just meed?" "The deed that does not reward itself is of little worth; 'the dust of praise is blown everywhere in men's faces :' a spirit of contrariety often prompts me to withhold it. How- ever, since you think it right, I suppose I must tell you that I have learned with some interest of your successes. YoQ have not been idle since I left St. Bevins." "Thank you. You first tell me what mere dross you con- sider praise, then fling it at me. It is something, though, to findd that you have not entirely forgotten St. Bevins." "I am considering your tastes, not mine, remember. What I may think is of little moment. Most people value themselves for their successes-I, for what one undertakes equally. Success is not invariably a test of merit, except, perhaps, in military life." "You are true to your instincts-woman the consoler- and would reserve praise by way of compensation, not reward." "If I am, it is more than most women are, else the in- stinets themselves are very false," she said, with a little flash. :.Reginald smiled: "You are caudid if not complimentary -to yourself, I mean." 3   50         IN A CRUCIBLE. "Have you ever heard of the fox doubling on the hounds? -a trick sportsmen are up to. I have left you nothing uncourteous to say of my sex. To take up the gauntlet would have required some exertion, and 'le jeut n'en vaut pas le chandelle.'  "Shall I remind you that you are criminating yourself? The courtesies of my profession force me to warn you." "( I plead guilty," she said quickly; "if to be false is to dissemble from the cradle to the grave. To play a r61t and play it well, is all that is left to most of us. You are to blame for it after all you leave us no other ambitions." "I must call the court to ordel;" he said, with a laugh: "you must not answer one charge by preferring another; you ignored my reference to St. Bevins, just now. It is little changed since you left it; I cannot say the same for you. Four years of travel have wrought marvels." - "A transition from the girl to the woman-s-parcely more, I imagine, nor would the coterie at St. Bevins be willing to-accredit me with a larger balance. It would be a poor compliment to their perspicacity. The manifestation of their sympathy and good-will was unequivocal. Some women might feel possessed ywith a feminine desire to test anew a very old and well-authenticated fact: that poverty and obscurity are like an infectious disease, which it is wis- dom to avoid, and for which prosperity is the only cure."  "Nay; now you are unjust. The world is not so far out of its reckoning, when it compels us to impress our own position. It stimulates a proper ambition to appear well, and one who will not make the effort, deserves the punish- meut." "At any rate, I cannot lay the charge of indifference to your family, Mr. Moreton. 'To your brother I owe the only kindness-ever shown me at St. Bevins. Poor Arthur! I never quite understood him."   IN A CRUCIBLE.   !    51 "Nor any one else, I venture to say. It is, not unlikely that he does not understand himself. A sort of Hamlet, full of dreamy, speculative moralizing that leads to small results. Yet he was not always so. As a boy, I remember him the sturdiest fellow in life at anything he undertook; and the best boxer, wrestler, and oarsman in the country round. A good rider, too, and as kind a fellow as ever lived, though not much on the Latin grammar or the Georgics. He took to muling and -moping after that jesuit business, which was most unfortunate altogether, and has spoiled as fine a man as ever struggled for first honors at college. All life and spirit went out of him, and the merest lad on the fourth form had more ambition." "Naturally an ambitious man, yet who fought down his ambitions on principle," she interrupted, "I have never be- lieved Hamlet either weak or irresolute. I think he had a strong moral sense that- rose up combatively. He feared hirnelf, not others. As to Arlhur, he is one in whose abil- ities and nerve I place great faith, though I cannot say it is warranted by anything he has ever achieved." "t Scarcely," said her companion, with a smile, thinking of Arthur's dull sermons. His smile rather irritated her. "I think Arthur could preach good sermons if he had a mind to; that is, if he thought it right." "That seems to me simply absurd," began Reginald; "why should not a man do his best in everything, and leave results alone, feeling that that is something quite beyond him."  "But that is just what he cannot do-the results are with him, if he is conscientious." "It is a question which I shall not arguee-cannot would be the better word, perhaps." This was saidwith-- a sup- pressed yawn that expressed well-bred indifference to- the theme she had selected for his entertainment. "ZI   b2         IN A CRUCIBLE. "I never understood Arthur's assumption of the ministry. If ambition didr not direct him-however, I will not offend you with the supposition. It is certainly not a profession to my taste.

"No sensible man would quarrel with it, though," he said with a laugh; (-"it would rather savor of the sybarite and hiis crumpled rose-leaf." There was no time for more. The door opened somewhat noisily and Trevor entered. He was a large, heavily-built, mili-taryrlooking main ; one who, would si-t hbi horse -well and leadsa charge gallantly, and whose aquirements, if, not ending here, might be summed up in shrewd bets on the race-track, and the invariable luck of " four by honors" at Cards. He had dull, commonplace features, unenlivened by a single play of expression; and if not homely, was some- thing much worse; a man whom it seemed scarcely possible such a woman could invest with any interest, not even tak- ing the Crimean episode into consideration. "Ah! ,Moreton, have I kept you waiting? sorry for it; but I'm a man of business, and rarely allow myself arnything like pleasure. Come, Parolet, no need to delay any longer. Take Mr. Moreton in and ring for the soup." His noisy, consequential manner jarred unpleasantly upon Reginald. Involuntarily he turned to the wife. There was not a shade of annoyance on her countenance; and again, when seated at the table, he glanced from Trevor, who was busily plying knife and fork over a meal from which his fastidious taste shrank with a feeling of actual repugnance: he could gather nothing from her face. She sat back, sip- ping her wine, and talking, in -her smooth, even tones of g     IN A CRUCIBLE.        -53 the war, and -its thousand matters of interest, and seemed entirely unobservant of her husband's ill-breeding. Quiet as she was, unobservant as she seemed, Reginald gathered enough before they rose from the table to know that she ruled him; ruled him   absolutely, yet with that quiet womanly control that did not debase him in his own eyes nor in those of another. His' admiration followed her throughout the evening, his thoughts striving, again and again, to reconcile his present interested impression of her with his former indifference. Yet it was quite consistent with his character, h  when her presence was withdrawn he lost the thread of such thought, and gathered to the fire with Trevor to discuss the plan of the year's campaign. He ,forgot Trevor's interesting wife in listening to what much more nearly concerned himself; and in another hour was more absorbed in newspaper polemics than he had' been in Parolet.   ('Cl ArTE[R V1L INITIAL ACQUAINTANCE. "But a voice Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless; What to bid speak    * . Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance, and Change? He gave man speech, and speech Created thought-unlocking science." - . IF Reginald had fallen into temporary forgetfulness of Parolet on the night before, it was natural that he should revert to her after a night's undisturbed rest. It was a face not to be lightly looked upon; certainly' not one to be passed over slightingly. He had formed a habit, and a very good one it is for any one engaged in professional life, of putting his finger upon the pulse of every individual organization within his reach; and he had generally been able to form a pretty fair esti- mate of the subject under his psychological scrutiny. His estimate was the more likely to be just, that he had puzzled himself little with the tangled theories of ancient or modern schools of metaphysics. That his hypotheses were sometimes at fault had not deterred him from persist- ently following them out, satisfied if he verified them once  in seven instances. Practical knowledge of the characters  i around us, is a better index to the intricate web of events, than all the theorems of Lavater, Quetelet, or any other writers of ideal or material philosophy. There were con- tradictory evidences in the face that rose before him, which he could not reconcile; yet there was enough to base specu- lation upon which might possibly, upon further acquaint- 54                 ;    IN A CRUCIBLE.         55 ance, substantiate his opinions. The physical and mental development had kept pace with singular persistency. Looking first at the bodily organization, he would have argued that the expansive propensity betraying itself in the person of the woman, conveyed a corresponding expan- siveness of intellect. The construction of the head indica- ted not only a rapid enlargement of the intellectual organs, but a corresponding growth of moral, or possibly immoral qualities, and seemed to imply a capability of still further development. Looking back to his recollections of her girlhood, comparing them one by one with the features of the portrait, his belief was strengthened into conviction. The'face had positively little character, the intellectual or- gans seemed depressed, or, at any rate, of that slow order of progression that, at mature age, would scarcely bring them to a state of perfection. This state of progression would naturally account for the entire transformation in the character of the brow and head. He argued that, from the formation of the head might be discovered at a glance the supremacy of moral or intellectual qualities. The large, full, or in other words expansive character of the head of Shakspeare, seems a direct indication of the character of the man. The head of Socrates furnishes another exemplar. Take again the Byronic, and undoubtedly lower order of mind, and, in the fine chiselling of feature, and more com- pact compass of head, we find a corresponding depression of psychological evidences. In any speculations which he was indulging in regard to this woman, he was arguing without previous knowledge of her antecedents. Some writer has said that we form our estimate of character generally from an acquaintance with family pedigree; and reconcile inconsistencies or moral depressions by some cross in the blood a century or two -back. Of Parolet's family he knew nothing.  They were not   5IN A CRUCIBLE.            natives; and he could just remember, looking back to his own boyhood, of their coming to St. Bevins. His only im- pression, and that not very vivid, was of a sallow-faced, large-eyed little girl in a white pinafore. St. Bevins gossip had not impressed him very favorably of the father,-a dark, foreign-looking man, with heavily moulded features and a swarthy red flushing up under his skin. Scarcely a man whose life one would venture to question; and who, to the day of his death, followed his reckless impulsbe eav- ing his child pretty much to herself and to her ouwn resources. It was not likely that the exclusives of St. Bevins left this fragment of family history without comment; yet the girl's youth, and her father's haughty reticence, had served to check impertinent inquiry. The singular name bestowed upon her, while it furnished a clue to the master-passion of her father's life, forced a painful publicity upon her, and as she grew older had been altered to Paralie. If his life had been a trial to her, she had no confidant, had never sought an entrance to the society afforded within the limits of the parish, and had followed out a quiet, uneventful life until his death. and her sudden mar- riage with- Captain Trevor. -So much of her history, Reginald knew: slender materials upon which to build his nicely-balanced, scientific theories, and affording scarcely more, had he been disposed to weave a romance; but he had no such inclination. He was not versed, in any degree, in the sickly sentimentalities of the present schobl of novelists, and was spinning no subtle threads upon any occult influence of sex. He had no mind to fall in love with his friend's wife, that not being a possibility com- prised within his code of honor; nor was he one to fall into such an error on impluse. He had taken an interest in the face which offered so fair a study for the explanation of    1IN A CRUCIBLE.   5.  his theory, and followed it out as he completed his half- finished morning toilet. It puzzled him too, and piqued his curiosity. He knew nothing of her tastes, habits, or pursuits: nothing which could furnish the slightest clue to prove his deductions. He smiled as he reflected how unlikely it was that he should ever have any opportunity of testing the correctness of his speculations. After a little, he bent over the toilet-table, drew a slip of paper to him, and, pencil in hand, sketched a hasty diagram, and wrote:  PRO.  Fine head. Prominent  organs of intelligence. Given to thought and study: rather systematic than rapid. A woman who would work- up well, patiently and untiring- ly in the face of obstacles. Mind, body, and con- science working har- moniously.  CON. Intellect not the pre- dominant development. Likely to be acted upon by moral or im- moral tendencies; ba- lance-questionable. Organization delicate. Subject to unaccount- able depressions. Stimulated  intelligence here would act upon the organic tendencies. Nature    exceptional and abnormal.   He glanced over what he had written, smiled again, and placing it between the leaves of an old volume of Fox's Martyrs that lay on the table, said: "The preponderance is against her. Will she work out the problem? If not, it will do to study such a char- acter, if I live to return and am not hampered with other things."  He paced the room slowly for some moments. He was studying her coldly and critically. Looking into the mir- ror, this thought seemed to strike him. If his theory was correct, he had no sympathy with -her. The small compact head and chiselled features enthroned a fine intelligence: there was scarcely any other perceptible development. Might he not judge wrongfully as well as unsympathetically? If so, what became of his boasted 3*  58        IN A CRUCIBLE. metaphysical knowledge? A physician judges bythe pulse of his patient, not by his own: places cool fingers over a fevered wrist, and counts the quickening throbs with the' precision of mathematical science. He was puzzling him- self with tangled threads, gathered up in the spirit of that vague mysticism that is creeping unhealthily over America and the American- people: striking its root deep in. the rank soil of New England, and spreading its fibrous, crawl- ing tendrils over the land; dangerous subtleties, fitted only for the handling of the high-priest--sucked in as eagerly by the tyros of literature as dew of Hermon. Dangerous fascinations they have proved in the rugged writings of Thomas Carlyle, and the finely-spun theories of German transcendentalists; worse still in the startling mathemat- ical problems of Quetelet and Buckle: meat for the strong, to which strong minds and hard thinkers are apt to turn greedily!  With a sudden desire to soften his harsh dictum, he opened the book, removed the slip of paper, and endorsed on thi back: ":It is not improbable that this woman presents the uncommon type that in Margaret Ossoli was termed 'a large soul."' Then he hastily closed the volume with a sharp snap, and sauntering down the stairs entered the ool morning-room, where the subject of his thoughts bent over the breakfast-urn. He could hardly retain any questionable judgment of her. What had become of his diagram up-stairs?

W t, even in'her presence, he returned to his theory not its skeleton form, perhaps, for, looking at her as he stirred the sugar in his coffee, he wondered why, with any belief in his system of perfect harmonies, this nature should not grow to perfection: why, unless jarred upon by coarse, extrane- ous circumstances. As hew reached this point he raised his eyes to hers, and his faith in her strengthened: his belief in her susceptibility to outside influences grew weaker. There was little conversation at the table, and in the pauses an almost impalpable shadow seemed to swoop down and gather under her long lashes. Was it possible that she had been subjected already to some severe test? Had she some sorrow out of which she had gathered up her mental energies without shaking herself entirely free from its influence? She was, at any rate, quite fearless under his scrutiny, which, he was at last becoming aware, was not quite what politeness demanded. Trevor was his next subject of observation; but he might as well have studied the blank wall, forming part of the masonry of the house. It was a nature so blank, that it refusej to cast even a passing -reflection of surrounding characters. There was some master-passion of her life; what was it? Not love, or it had been a sacrifice; and her life was not a blighted one, if surmise could furnish an accurate estimate. She had disclaimed his compliment of the night before; yet he smiled as he noticed the almost unconscious effect she had given to her very decided beauty of outline, in her simple morning-dress. "Moreton," said Trevor. rising as he spoke, "I have work on hand down-town. Shall you remain here? If so, my wife will entertain you. Paralie, show him your Para- dise."   60         IN A CRUCIBLE. He closed - his speech with a laugh: a noisy, self-satisfied laugh, as if he imagined he had made the paradise for her. While he spoke, his wife was standing, leaning one hand lightly on the back of A chair; and as Reginald looked at her, she threw her head over her shoulder without turning round, and said: '4 It is only paradise because it is unshared by others." An arch smile rippled over her lip, and again the similar- ity of expression and attitude reminded him of the unfor- tunate Cenci. She raised her white hand, sweeping aside with a rapid motion the voluminous folds of an olive-hued curtain, with a faint tinkling of the rings against the brass rod, and motioned him to follow. In another instant she again raised the curtain, and be heafrd her voice mingled in low tones with her husband's. She followed him down the hall,- paused longe enough for him to take his hat and cane from the- rack, and closed the door after him. Then he heard her coming back through the hall, with her rapid, sweeping walk, that was as full of character as everything else she did. In another moment she stood beside him. - For the first time since his entrance, he turned his eyes upon his surroundings. It was a pleasant room, with windows opening east and west; those east looking out on a summer grass-plot, with a spicy odor coming up from the shrubberies. A silvery spray shot up from a slender, marble column, and fell in sparkling showers into a broad marble basin with a pleas- ant, liquid gurgle. The edge of the basin was- wreathed  with delicately wrought leaves and blossoms of acanthhus, and a laughing Naiad peeped at her marble image in the water.  Blush-roses lifted their dewy faces in the, sunshines; a rare Lamark twined its creamy clusters on a slender trellis- work, and scarlet Lobelias trailed their :e&riy'splendors i   IN A CRUCIBLE.  close by. Tiny fish flashed their rainbow hues in the ba- sin, and greedily caught, at the. crumbs she dropped on the water; while a gorgeous peacock, who had been spreading his plumes on- the sun-dial, descended with a hoarse cry to share the morning meal; Within, the wide french casements were- draped with soft lace, caught away by fragile, alabaster lilies; a bright rose-hue diffused itself from the variegated carpet under foot, while the morning light flashed from pictures in small oval frames, and dipped into:the heart of a magnificent cluster of damask-roses, freshy gathered, and arranged deftly in a basket on a small stand before the chimney- piece.-. Their rich-hued petals nestled in a bed of dark- green, glossy leaves; and a branch of the scarlet Lobelia was twined about the margin of the crystal basket, and, trailing arol -the spiral column of support, hung with its heavy blossoms on the floor. A low couch stood at the open window, with a light, silk-lined basket of needlework within reach. In the space between the windows were prettily carved hanging-shelves, of dark rosewood, filled with neatly bound volumes, and surmounted by a statuette of exquisite workmanship, representing Cupid and Psyche: the rosy god lightly poised in air, just hovering tantalizing- ly over the tempting lips raised to his. Over the mantel hung a half-sized oval painting of An- dromeda   It was a well-executed work of art; with the soft, neutral tints of sea and sky, relieved by the delicate lifeohued of the human figure. There was hopeless aban- donment in the form, and in the droop of the small hands with the iron-bound wrists; yet the pallid, pearly face was raised out of the dark masses of hair heavenward.

Books and manuscripts serve me in lieu of companionship." "Where is your husband?" It was a rude question-an insolence that scarcely any but a Moreton would have ventured; and he had put it with that easy, high-bred manner that belonged to him, keeping his cool eyes upon her the while, and his fingers pressing; metaphorically, upon her angry pulse., The flash was instantaneous; and rising coolly, she said, with the slightest perceptible sneer in her voice: "' Captain Trevor scarcely finds time to lounge away his life in a lady's morning-room; he is' one of the workers in the hive,"' With which she swept out of the room, and he heard her quick step going in the direction of the out-door offices. He waited until the last echo died away; then taking her place at the :open window, watched the peacock strutting about in the bun, and indulged himself in a low, silvery peal of laughter, that Edith had designated as " a thousand times worse than an insult." They- met no-more until the dinner-hour, which passed away pleasantly enough until the wine and fruit were brought on: then, Trevor-led the conversation into the well-worn channel of political agitation. They were quite unmindful of the woman who sat so quietly at the head of her own table, losing no syllable that fell from their lips. Trevor's straightforward soldierly predilection for war, led -Moreton into some revelation of his -own carefully i masked views.  He talked over his wine, ringing the un- i conscious Moreton-changes on the perpetual chord Ego: the insolent pride stepping out boldly, and seeming to say: "You might impugn me ze, you cannot penetrate the panoply   6        . IN A CRUCIBL4: of family dignities which lend their halo to render my motives unquestionable." A poor prostitution, it seemed, of the immortal gold At- bition, that he was decking with such flimsy show ;- ahnd:he was suddenly startled by the ringing voice from the head I of the table: . "Mr. Moreton, did you ever hear of Lord  ? of whom it was said he had been all his life imprisoned in a name, and could never expand into a man." At its close she raised a cluster of purple grapes slowly to her-lips. She could detect no flush on his countenance, but the violet veins in his forehead swelled ominously. She looked defiance into the blue eyes that met her own, and with a smile of feminine triumph at her gratified revenge, left the table. But she was not to escape so. As she passed him he rose, made a mock reverence, and said, with a light laugh: " Vae victis ! you have ' ploughed with my heifer."'  His eyes followed her until she flung herself down under the lights, took out some fancy bead-work, and unrolled it. For a minute or two he watched her white fingers flashing in and out, then returned to his wine, taking up the broken thread of his conversation where her speech had interrupted it. A half-hour later he stood at her side: " Will you sign a truce ? I needed chastisement." "We are unequal combatants," she said, looking up:  I lose my temper, and am no match for your coolness." "I have a right to object to your mode of warfare. I understood you an, advocate for any aspirations, any ambi- tions," "Ambitions," she iterated, slowly. " Yes; but they must find, their reflections in something better than a river over which we hang, Narcissus-like, to catch its perpetual sym- phonies of self."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         67 "Lofty' ambitions are not rife," he said. "Only pure ones are needful," she returned.  "Even the glow-worm's spark is not to be despised, and ele- vates the crawling insect above his species, in our esti- mation."   CHAPTER ViII.  THE RECTOR'S NOVITIATE. "O man I hold thee on in courage of soul Through the stormy shades of thy worldly way, And the billows of cloud that aeround thee roll Shall sleep in the light of a wondrous day.". .AT,.AN FENWICK had carried an open sesame to the hearts of his new congregation, in the genial nature that belonged to him, and in the thrill of eloquence that awoke the quiet echoes of the old church. He had not kept faith with Arthur, in every respect; and his enthusiastic belief in the efficacy of Arthur's delf-ware, as applied to the de- fects of his spiritual nature, had cooled rapidly, once re- moved from the compelling influence of Arthur's presence. It was a question open to speculation, whether he mIight not be just as good a Christian, drinking Bohea out of Sevres! At any rate, he had too much in hand, taking care of other souls, to be unnecessarily engrossed in eleva- ting his own egoism into the requisie pattern of clerical perfection. He had arrived at this, in a much simpler fashion than refining subtle processes of reasoning; but as his conclusions were perfectly satisfactory to himself, I do not know that we are called upon to question their falli- bility. The ministerial lodgings had been made as cheerful, com- fortable, and pleasant as circumstances would admit. The dingy hangings were replaced with bright chintz curtains; the book-shelves, which in Arthur's day had groaned under heavy tomes of theological literature,-worthy Divines of several centuries ago-very learned, but, in Fenwick's 68  UN A CaVCTIkW,.        69 opinion, rather dry, and only necessary to be looked into occasionally,--had given place to brighter bindings of a more suspicious orthodoxy. Plato and Aristotle, in half-calf, nestled lovingly against Jeremgy Taylor and Melville. Shelley, Goethe, and Schiller, in russet and gold, jostled a hogt of the Christian Fathers against the letters of Junius. Sterne's Sentimental Journey cowered beside the coarse satires of Swift; and-tell it not in Gath!-Smollet and Fielding ranged unblushingly beside a number of bound reviews on an upper shelf. Yet, Fenwick wrote capital sermons; with a savor of wholesome orthodoxy, to save them from the leaven of stray gleanings-from Shelley, or a borrowed axiom of old, heathen- ish Plato; smacking strongly of primitive philosophy, and recommended to, the Christian congregation of St. Philips with a- dash of godliness in unexceptionable rhetoric. One of these specimens of composite art-labor lay open on the baize-covered table, near the vellum and gilt case in which it was laid on the pulpit-desk every Sunday, and a delicately chased gold pen and holder stood in the Sevres stand, with the ink drying rapidly on its nib. There were boxing-gloves under a pile of newspapers, andtrouple of swords with foils on the pointsvwere crossed over the chim- njey-piece. A  fine, smooth-bore rifle, with chased silver mountings, stood in a green case in the corner, while col- ored prints of game and fowling scenes hung against the walls. Here, the refilling power of the Rev. Allan Fenwick, ceased. He could not pull down the ugly brick wall that fronted .his windows, forming the rear of a long row of shops, called, none knew why, Artisans' Row, unlespit- took its name from the tinshop, carpenter, cooper, house-painter, and silversmith's' establishment, forming part of the dignity of K--    village. It frowned with grim, utilitarian aspect   70         IN A CRUCIBLE. over Allan's windows, shutting out all but a glimpse of stars in the blue vault overhead, and giv-ing rise to various unclerical expletives on the lips of the Rev. Mr.- Fenwick. Nor could heshut out the, stifling atmosphere- from: the little street; his only remedy for avoiding unseemly explo- sive tendencies was, to seize his, rifle or fishing-rod, und plunge into. the cool .solitudes of the surrounding country. His fastidious :ears were often saluted with the sound of drunken street brawls, startling his midnight- slumbers; and, with a muttered imprecation on the revellers, he would settle himself to sleep, vowing to hurl anathemas:at their heads from his pulpit on the following Sunday. - But .the Rev. Mr. Fenwick rarely found any opportunity to vent his righteous wrath in this manner; for the class in question rather gathered under the eloquent thunders of his compet- itor in the Methodist meeting-house, that stood on- the second square in the village - Sunday after .Sunday-they put their hats reverently under the square benches, squirted tobacco-juice out of the staring windows, hung-their heads shamefacedly under the scathing denunciations of Brother Wythe against the individual lying of Tom, the tinker, or the individual drunkenness of John, the carpenter, or the individual theft of Joe, the cooper. Sometimes the culprit sneaked softly down the aisle, followed by a simultaneous turning of all eyes in the meeting-house. Then there would be a sudden pause in the thunders from the pulpit, a sudden softening of the muscles around Brother Wythe's mouth, and, after once more -gathering himself up, and launching a hurtling bolt at the retreating offender, followed by the sympathies of the ninety and nine sinners that went unrebuled, the services would close. It was rather aggra- vating to Mr. Fenwick walking rhoe after del veing one of hisr finest metaphysical osermons to a imiited congrega- tion, to see the swarm of listener issuing from the door-of   IN A CRUCIBLE.         71 the: rival, church. 'Altogether, the Rev. Mr. Fehwick -was -not so well pleased with his rectorship as he might have been; and began to form a faint suspicion that he had been -rather done by the, Rev. Arthur. - Struggling under the: burden of his trying novitiate, his -patience was brought to its climax by the sharp query of one0 of his female' members: ." Why don't- you chant the first part of the Tresagion, Mr. Fenwick? Mr. Moreton always did, -and, though I don't suppose it makes a great deal of differerce, sdtillWe- are used to it, you know, and it is better not-to set them talking." The sting'of a thou- sand .insects. could hardly- have goaded him more, in his :present state of irritability, and there was a strong twitch- ing in the parson's right shoulder, with a sympathetic clos- ing of, the fingers on the palm of his right hand. Perhaps it' was well for thec questioner that he remembered her sex, and answered just a little sharply: "Perhaps I had better refurnish my room on the model of the Rev. Mr. Moreton's, Miss Adeliza; and pray tell the good people of K that you found -me reading Cardinal Wiseman,"-a sarcasm entirely lost on-the poor little woman, who had been one. of the best supporters of the church, and a firm friend of' Mr. Moreton's. She scarcely knew the distinction between High and Low Church, and if called upon would, probably, have defined one as burning-candles-the other, as the non-usage of, these' significant and offensive insignia of Romanism. Mr. Fenwick repented of his little outhurst. the moment it was over, and hastened to offer Miss Adeliza some cordial' -out- of his- corner cupboard; but, on -her de- parture, he could- not'- divest. himself of -the idea, that, possibly, the conscientious: scruples of the Rev. Arthur had been a convenient subterfuge to rid hnself of the trials of his redtorship. It was a thought unworthy of himself or his friend, and -he blushed to remember it some   72s        IN A CRUCIBLE. time after, when he had gathered up stray glimpses of Ar- thur's eight years' experience of St. Philips. He had been the first incumbent; and his first parochial sermon had been preached to ah audience of six or seven in number, ignorant of the form of the service; had been followed by responses from a single voice through the lita- ny; yet he had manfully looked his discouragements in the face. Everything must have a beginning: patiently and quietly the work of the Church, intrusted to his care, throve. Gradually, the congregation numbered a respectable body -of female members, whose husbands decorously followed them into the pews, that were free, as Mr, Moreton had distinctly given them to understand. Here was a hard blow struck, at once, in favor of his work. Rented pews were an abomination of the Romish Church, to these simple- minded people--simple-minded, as regarded all that per- tained to the Church. Soon, stragglers from the village gathered in the door-way, or lounged into the pews within easy dart of the door, in case the alms-plate was brought out; some, because the sweet, solemn strains of the organ, -an unwonted novelty in the little village, was a welcome sound after the nasal bass from the lusty lungs of Brother Wythe. No bursts of eloquence brought repentant heads under the solemnizing hands of the Bishop in his yearly visita- tion; yet the work prospered, and Mr. Moreton glowed under the honest praise of his superior and of his brother clergymen. Eloquence was not needed for his straightfor- Ward doctrines of Revealed Religion; and the young faces that looked up into their minister's year after year from the family-pews, got a fair sense of the precioul grain gar- 'nered infto their hearts, and an inking of the -dogmas of the 'Chureh, which; with a- stflient -knoiledge of crds d : and Church articles, to aid the Church catechisi, brought them   IN A CRt'CIBLE.         73 into the fold of Christ, and effectually established a branch of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the village of K . The young aspirants for Church honors looked eagerly on these yearly visitations of their Bishop, to catch some special notice from the kindly, benevolent face; the children that were held in his arms smiled under the sign of the cross, that brought them into the Church militant; and the older members were equally amenable to his patriarchal influence; thrilling with emotion under the sonorous voice that promised them the peace and happiness stamped in undeniable characters on his fine countenance; rising eager- ly to catch the benediction from his saintly lips. Was it a marvel, that when those hands raised high the righteous sword in one, the banner of the Church, furled, in the other, that thousands of Christian swords leapt from their scab- bards, thousands of Christian hearts prayed for blessings on the cause of our soldier of the cross? Things went smoothly with the Rev. Mr. Moreton for awhile; but, during the fourth year of his rectorship, an event occurred which threatened to undermine his popu- larity, and under the shock of which even his constituents were shattered. There had been a sudden death in Artisans' Row. The man was a confirmed inebriate, and of the Methodist per- suasion.  The Rev. Mr. Wythe was absent; having been called, suddenly, to the death-bed of a near relative, in a distant part of the State. There was nothing to be done but to call upon the Rev. Mr. Moreton, with a request to perform  the burial-services. -Mr. Ploreton, aware of the absence of the Methodist minister, was prepared for a sum- mons of that nature, and was in some perplexity as to his course.   He was well aware of the prejudices of class; and would gladly have availed himself of any pretext to avoid arousing their animosity, had his conscientious scruples per- 4   74         IN A CRUCIBLE. mitted; but having once made up his mind on that point, personal inconvenience was not to be weighed in the balance. A deputation of brother workmen waited upon him, and preferred their request. They were honest men, with no great regard for the distinctions of class, and quite as ready to assert their privileges as any well-lectured disciple of the agrarian school; yet they cid feel some little awkwardness in the perfectly courteous presence of the Rev. Mr. Moreton. Their rough, red hands had a nervous facility in diving in and out of the capacious pockets of the Sunday-suits into which they had installed themselves as the first step toward respectability. He knew hone of them, except by sight, and recognized, in the spokesman, the village silversmith. He raised his eyes and glanced into the row of those that were bent anxiously on his face. "Will you be seated?" he said, courteously; "I cannot give you a direct answer." They obeyed his gesture and seated themselves, with their hands resting uneasily on their knees. When the noise made by this proceeding had subsided, he said: "This man died in a confirmed habit of drink, did he not?" There was a murmur of assent, and the eyes of the sil- versmith sparkled, as if he thought there might be some personal reflection; he being known as the delinquent who came oftenest under the anathemas of Brother Wythe. -Ar- thur played iidly with his hand among the papers on the table, and his eyes fixed themselves musingly on the floor. Suddenly, he asked: "A family man?" "Wife and six children." ('Ah!"  The ejaculation was a pitying one; but its sympathetic tone was quite lost on his audience, who were beginning to exchange glances of distrust. Arthur cleared his throat, and, after a slight hesitation,   IN A CRUCIBLE.         75 said: "My friends, will you try not to misunderstand me, when I tell you that by the ordinances of my Church I am forbidden to read the full burial-services over this man. He died in unrepented sin, as far as we know, and is-denied the benefits that are rendered to Christian burial. If you can find no one to perform the office, I will read, at the grave, such portions of the service as are permitted." His voice was grave and quiet, and he rose as if the mat- ter was quite settled. Of course, they could do no less than rise too; and with a surly grunt expressive of assent the deputation filed out, the silversmith turning his head at the door, to say, with a grin, "Of coorse if the Methody preach- er'd a bin here, we'd not a troubled you." His pleasantry, though satisfactory to himself, was entirely lost on Arthur, who stood at his window with that far-away look in his eyes that frequently usurped them in hours of' loneliness. His heart was not lightened when the coarse voices rang out in the street: "A d-d kid-gloved parson!" "Who'll bury old Holland when he dies?" "Wonder if there's any difference 'twixt drinkin' brandy or rum." "Three cheers for the Methody parson ; three groans for the silk-stockin' church;" and on they went to the Town- hall. There was a strong indignation-meeting that night, and mighty eloquence swelled the bosom of the chosen orator of the Plebs; while Arthur finished off his weekly sermon. It was quite late, when a timid knock at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Adeliza Raeburn. The poor little woman untied her bonnet-strings with nervous fingers, and turned a very pale face to the light of Arthur's solitary candle. "Ah! Mr. Moreton, can't you take it all back? They are   76         IxN A CRUCIBLE .  making dreadful work about it down there; and, indeed, I am afraid you will lose all your popularity." Mr. Moreton smiled--one of his kindly patient smiles- and had recourse to the identical corner-cupboard already mentioned, to restore Miss Raeburn's nerves, before he said: "My dear lady, do you not understand that I am acting under authority?" "Would it have made a great deal of difference?" pleaded the little woman. "If you could only have done it and said nothing about it: they are so ignorant of church-matters." Mr. Moreton looked at her, and she turned away her face directly, blushing scarlet, and stammering: "Of course you know best. I did not mean to hint you should deceive any one ; ' If they ask bread, we must not give them a stone,'  she said, quoting what Scripture came into her puzzled head to rectify her first error. "At any rate, I'll stand by you, Mr. Moreton; I've every faith in you ;" and she rose and drew her cloak around her, putting her hand out timidly. "Thank you," he said heartily, taking and pressing it kindly between his own. There was a drop of comfort in the womanly voice that expressed her trust in him; and he did not undervalue it because she was, not the wisest among his congregation. There were many who were too wise to counsel or to comfort him in such a strait; and his benediction followed the figure of the lonely little old maid across the street. She was full of sympathy for him, and for the widow and orphans in the Row, and wondered "why people need be so particular about trifles;" yet she was a conscientious woman, in every relation of her life; following undeviatingly the feeble light that flickere4 and glimmered before her moral vision. Arthur read the burial-service, as he had promised; and few would have been the wiser had he observed the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         " silence Miss Raeburn recommended. The storm was long in blowing over, nor did Mr. Moreton in any degree regain his popularity until the small-pox broke out in the village. Then he went in and out in the kindliest fellowship with Mr. Wythe, on their errands of mercy; and rough eyes learned once more to look kindly on the patient face and sturdy form that went so untiringly about his labor of love. Many other parish reminiscences of their former pastor Allan heard. How the little faces in the Sunday-class had brightened as he took his place in their midst, or bent to lay his broad hand encouragingly on some youthful head. It was easy to see that he had won their hearts; and Allan owed much of his own-opularity to his lively interest -in their "recollections of the country-parson." Just after the excitement created by Arthur's refusal to read the burial-service over Jonas Flint, his own church, from some accidental cause, was temporarily closed, and the congregation, many of whom had collected without previous knowledge of the fact, followed their minister to the Rev. Mr. Wyt'he's church. Great was the surprise of the Methodist congregation, when he -walked into their midst, his tall form, with the long, black coat buttoned firmly across the broad chest, towering among a few of his own flock. He reverently uncovered his head, and seated himself in one of the side-benches. Side-glances, betokening wonder and surprise, were cast upon the imperturbable face; but they read nothing more in it than they could in the square broad back and huge shoulders that looked so noncommittal. The Rev. Mr. Wythe was unusually eloquent, and Arthur relaxed into pleased attention. The simple, earnest faith of the preacher, his childlike petitions to the throne of grace, and the vivifying shouts with which he woke the echoes of Zion, roused Arthur's sympathies.   78    .     IN A CRUVCIBLE. Sdidenly, as the hymn ceased, the minister descended the pulpit stairs, came forward, and, with his hand on the railing, invited the members to partake of the holy com- muniton, and included in his invitation his brother clergy- man there present. This, of course, meant Arthur, none other, at the time, being present. Circumstances seemed strangely perverse, in all that related to him; yet he had no more idea of shrinking in the face of that congregation than in the solitude of his own room. He made no question of the man's sincerity or of his goodness; but he had no authority, in his eyes, for administering the eucharist. Rising resolutely from his seat, with a face only slightly paler than at his entrance, Mr. Moreton made his way noise- lessly through the crowded aisle and waft back' to his lodgings, with the same dull weight at his breast-the same sense of isolation written in his eyes, that he had had on the evening when Miss Raeburn gave him her mite of con- solation. He longed then, as he had ever and often, for thbe comfort of another voice, the sympathy of other eyes; yet all the water-springs of human happiness had dried up, and his hot lips' thirst could not always be quenched with j heavenly dew! This little episode had stirred the old  X leaven. of malice against him anew, for a little while; but it died away in time, as such things will, if we persevere in right-doing, and he lived it down with his patient courage, and the purity of a life that fearlessly challenged scrutiny. Allan felt a dash of his old, impetuous tenderness, as he gathered up these broken links, and worked it off in a gush t of reproachful, epistolary effusion, that raised a smile' on Arthur's unconscious lip, as he folded'it into his vest-pocket. If he thought about the matter at all, it was with a sus- picion that poor Allan had been doing something that deserved friendly rebuke, and was in a state of edifying  i     t     IN A CRUCIBLE.         79 repentance. Certainly, Fenwick's head lay a little uneasily on his pillow after his harsh judgment of his friend, until he received an affectionate response to his letter, when the whole thing was banished from his mind, if not quite forgotten. ^P   CHAPTER IX. PRINCE AND PEASANT. ' Ah! that sweet little foot; I swear I could kneel down and kiss it there. I should not mind if she were Pope: I would change my faith." Festus,  THERE was no scenery in or around St. Philips; at least none so called: no mountains around whose summits the rosy mists of morning might gather; no hills, over whose green slopes the flocks of lazy southdowns might graze; no jagged cliffs against which a heavy, rolling sea might thunder its eternal- harmonies, though miles and miles away, the arrowy river flowed with deepening current into the Mexican gulf, broadening near its outlet, flattening at its edges, and the sedgy margin running out into great stretches of marshy ground.  Higher up, in and around   : St. Philips, it flowed sluggishy, through steep banks, in the ! summer-time; swelling angrily with winter floods and tides, i and rushing hoarsely along, its current broken here and   j there into eddies Iround a clump of stunted willows bedded in the sand, or sweeping out into broad curves, with the sunlight dancing over it, and the comfortable country- houses mirrored in the still, glassy surface, just at sunset. The country was not picturesque; but would have de- lighted the eye of the agriculturist, in its rich grain-   i fields, luxuriant hedges, and well-kept gardens. There were wide, open commons, filled with browsing cattle; fat pasture-lands, where the sleek, through bred stock of the plantations ranged, chewing their cuds contentedly under 80              il   IN A CRUCIBLE.         81 the shade-trees through the summer-heat, and lowing gently as they followed the narrow pathway, cropDin as they went, to the milking-pens-evening shadows gathering the Whllile, and the shrill chirp of insects growing clamorous as the sun descended. Yet there was beauty in the aspect of the landscape-a beauty to satisfy even a fastidious taste; and Fenwick felt it so, escaping from the confinement of' his lodgings, and eager for a sight of God's handiwork. If there were neither hills nor mountains, there were clouds that, evening after evening, piled themselves in fan- tastic masses against the setting sun, and whose outlines stood out, bold and clear, against the western light. There were gorgeous strips of coloring, too,-painted skies, with the sun sinking down, like a huge red ball, in the midst: sun- sets that equalled anything for richness of hue that the human eye ever looked upon. There was deep, sombre blue in the evening skies, that Poussin had striven- vainly to paint; and a glint in the golden sunlight, pouring over river, wood, and field, that Claude could never match! There was a softness in the air, when the October mists rolled over the woodlands, and the autumn moonlight sil- vered the earth, that even the passionate heart of the poet could not breathe, and that hushed the fevered pulse while the planets glowed in the dusky canopy overhead. There were stretches of forest with giant oaks, and whispering poplars turning their silver-lined leaves to the light,-slender sumachs that blushed red under autumn skies,-broad spreading magnolias,-immortal bays, filling the air with their faint, subtle breath,--hawthorns, powdered in the spring like crusted snow, and flashing scarlet with the first frost that ripened the clusters of berries on their stems: woods under whose towering crowns only the winter sun- light might creep, when the dead leaves rustled softly under foot, and wildwood blossoms grew luxuriantly,-   82         IN A CRITCIBLE. gorgeous in tint, soulless thinygs-wanting the soul of flowers in their lack of perfume!  Here, you sometimes stumbled over sloping mounds, where, underneath the shadows of these great western forests, the bones of the red-men lie bleaching, with the centuries that roll over them: dead, indeed, since their rest is undisturbed by the march of civilization and science, whose gigantic proofs stare us in the face in this latter day! The roadside was thickly grown up with purple heather, and flaunting lilies of scarlet and, yellow covered the flat, marshy plains; while graceful water-lilies hung silent in the summer noon, spreading their dark-green, glossy leaves out over the water, where tiny fish swam  in and out, and where, through the short summer nights, the frogs croaked hoarsely, and ugly spotted snakes coiled among  the reeds.  : Allan Fenwick had fed his taste for beauty in the galleries of Florence, Rome, and Naples: had watched the sun go down behind the low-lying level of Arabian deserts, flashing out its dying radiance over the yellow sands,-had seen the "cloud-capt towers and gorgeous palaces" of cloudland fade under the mellow light of Italian skies,- had seen the eastern flushes, out beyond the space where rise the sombre, monumental glories of Egypt,--had fed his soul with the grand limning of Nature, among her favored scenes; yet he was not unmindful of the beauty and glory that comes with God's sunlight everywhere! All our pleasures are estimated by contrast: so saith the philosopher; and be that as it may, it was with a keen zest that the refined Rector of St. Philips strayed along the banks, on an early autumn evening, courting the sweet river breeze that played in his tangled locks, and turning his eyes over field and wood and water. With the zest of a  boy, he counted up the week's pains and trials, and, /    IN A CRUCIBLE.         83 setting them against the delight of this autumnal stroll, felt that he held the balance in his favor. He was in just the mood to be delighted at anything. If his temper was easily ruffled, you could scarcely retain any recollection of his ill-humor, when the mood had worn off. He kept his recovered temper so persistently in the foreground, that you involuntarily forgot all that lay behind it. He had come out, determinecdto see everything that could possibly enhance his sense of enjoyment within the limits of his walk; and, with only nature and himself to come to his assistance, would have gone back to his work with a stock in hand of animal spirits that would have sustained the mercury in his barometer for some weeks. As it happened, he was not to be left to the unassisted efforts of nature and his own moralizing on this particular evening. He had not proceeded far when he came to a stand, and, with his eyes fixed upon some object a few yards in ad- vance of him, uttered a very emphatic ejaculation, expres- sive of surprise and admiration. The figure upon which he gazed was that of a child-or a woman,-and, for a moment, he was puzzled to decide which, the 'form was so diminutive, the face so infantile! His observation was quite unconscious, on her part, it seemed, for her eyes re- mained fixed on the book she held in her hand. She was seated just on the edge of the bank, one foot curled up, the other dangling in the water that rolled below her. That she belonged to the lower orders, he had every reason to believe. Her clothing was coarse, and her feet bare, as were her arms and shoulders; yet the face, visible to him in outline, was delicate in coloring and refined in feature. If a peasant face, it was such as might be traced in the cartoons of Raphael, or that are seen stamped in the medal- lions on a Sevres vase-softly tinted, ruby-lipped, small. limbed; with pretty, dimpled shoulders, with soft arms, 4*    84         IN A CRUCIBLE. and small hands; even the bare feet were white- and plump, with blue veins traced under the skin, coral-tipped at the toes,' and joining a round, slender ankle, which swelled voluptuously under her short gown. What was her age-what was she--what doing there? A mass of shining hair made her crowning glory, though tangled and e unkempt; and while the lights and shadows from the water played over her face, and her earnest eyes riveted themselves on the open page, Allan, who was watching her, grew skeptical. A peasant! Pshaw! She had beauty that might have crowned a princess of the blood! Stealing softly behind her, Allan read the title of the page: "Rasselas; Prince of Abyssinia." "Rasselas, and bare feet!" he muttered under his breath; "Dr. Johnson and a milkmaid, possibly; shades of Parnassus!? Allan Fenwick's was perhaps a' super- refined taste. He would blave turned from Burns, in his ploughman's habiliments-scouted Goldsmith among his pot-companions. In selecting a- profession, he had not been unmindful of the graceful refinement that clung to his cloth. He was- a great believer in caste! He held in great honor a silky-eared setter, when he would have kicked a barnyard cur; he had great delight in mounting his half:bred arabian, yielding his clerical prejudice to the very unortho- dox bias of belief in its claims to something better than high animal intelligence; and would have walked ally distance sooner than mount one of the large-jointed, long- limbed Dobbins, that seemed born to the plough. He had never seen anything heretofore to upset his little theories in favor of caste, as regarded his own species; and it was very well understood among his friends, that if the Rev. Allan ever took unto himself a wife, it would be with a very critical eye to her good points. If hWekept sight of. $1X   IN A CRUCIBLE.         85 his prejudices in favor of blood in his stock,-and it was his pleasure to think the milk from his Alderney sweeter than that from farmer Holland's black native-bred,-he in- tended to be no less particular in matters more nearly relating to himself. He had very obstinately held his opinions until now; but, looking down upon this dainty specimen of plebeian origin, with only the pure, sweet odors of a country life around him, with every hue and shade in harmony with the combination of physical and spiritual beauty in the scene of which she seemed but a type, Allan Fenwick felt inclined, in an instant, to laugh away the prejudices of a lifetime. Like all enthusiastic natures that run into obstinate theories, his faith was staggered at the first startling contradiction that presented itself. As his shadow fell between herself and the sunlight, the " girl turned, and looked at him. It was a look tending somewhat to restore Allan's nervous mental equilibrium and enabled him to draw upon facts, to support what had been rather staggered by the glamour Qf imagination. His second glance revealed to him eyes in which were wanting both the refinement of intelligence, and of that spiritual light %which threw her out of harmony with the scene. Af- ter that analogy was lost, what was to sustain her? She had not withdrawn her foot from the water, but sat looking at him, with that unmoved scrutiny, devoid appa- rently of curiosity or interest. She was too well formed, and there was a  look about the face that prevented his lapsing into his first misapprehension about her age. She was fully fifteen, he thought,--possibly older; but her size made it not very prudent to lose sight of her claim to wo- manhood. It was not unlikely that, looking at the small dimpled face, with the pretty pouting lips, one would be likely to forget it; seeing tears in the eyes, or the lips quiv.   86        IN A CRUCIBLE. ering with pain or grief, it would seem most natural to lay a caressing hand over the dimples, or kiss the pretty mouth into quietude. - Reared in a city drawing-room, the conven- tionalities of society would have come to the little maiden's aid, fencing her in with all the dignity and decorum that belonged to her years. Yet, how was it possible that Fen- wick, or any other man, should remember it now, looking at her bare feet, and into the eyes that had never beheld anything grander than the great chandeliers in the Town- hall. He did not remember it, and putting his hand on the curly head, said: "What do you think of Dr. Johnson, little girl?"  "Sir?" she replied, with a stare.   . "Of the Prince, then?" he returned, with a smile. Swift as a flash, something came into her face that brought back his first more favorable impression of her. What was it? Not intelligence! It scarcely deserved so high a classification. It was a brightening of the-counte- nance, as if what he said had reached some inner chord of feeling, while it failed to convey anything of soul or in- telligence. Cultivation here would fertilize but little. If  there was any soil, it was alluvial; and then not susceptible of much culture. This, in part, was already hers, if he were to judge from the book she held in her hand. He thought all this vaguely, watching the brightening spread over the face, while he waited for her answer. She shook her head slowly: "I don't; like him near so much as I do a great many princes I've read about: he's not grand enough. I don't know what he wanted when he had everything to make 4im happy." ' Then you think princes should be very happy and always contented, and that grandeur is a great thing?" "Ah, ir, I'd like to do nothing but read about rich and powerful, people! They must be happy: who would not   IN A CRUCIBLE.         87 be, with fine clothes to wear, and nice things to eat, and to be able to go pleasuring instead of working!" "So you think all rich people happy? You have not learned Dr. Johnson's first lesson." She looked puzzled. "Are you not as happy as I am?" She glanced, first, at her coarse frock, then at his gentle- manly attire, and shook her head with a little sigh. "Very expressive, my little maiden," said Fenwick, with a laugh; " but let us reckon up. You shall be judge and I'll plead the cases. Are you ever hungry-really hungry, you know?" "No."  "Nor cold?" "Yes." "Ah! that strikes a balance. However, that's only bodily ailments,-of small account, philosophers tell us. Now, mentally, what arse your most frequent sensations?" "Sir?" "Never mind," said Fenwick, shifting his laughing gage as it met her serious eyes; " why don't you call the court to order? Are you contented? No, only envious of princes in fairy-tales, I suppose. I fear Dr. Johnson is lost on you." She did not understand his banter; but she began to flush under a sense that he was ridiculing her. "I don't know what they are-I only know that they have what I never do, that it makes me want to drown my- self, or run away where I needn't see them looking glad, and warm, and happy." "Ah! that is a train of logic you did not look into Dr.. Johnson for; though you might find it in some revolution- ary literature more to your taste. Come! you have made a case out against us: now listen. I dress well, and you do not: but I have cares that you know nothing of. There's only the difference of a toss-up between our cases; you ' .if   '88        IN A CRUCIBLE. have the best of it, if anything. What is the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee? You don't know? Well, I am called upon to decide that momentous question almost daily, and it is quite as great a puzzle to me as to you. Think what an offset to fine clothes that is."' There had long been a doubt in his mind whether the undefined longings which beset humanity were a thing of soul or of intelligence. "Which do you suffer most from, cold, or ; that pain that makes you want to drown yourself?" "-That," she said, emphatically; but I can stop it when I come out here, where there's nothing to make me angry. This all belongs to me as well as to them. I like to lie out here, and listen to the wind and the water. It makes me feel good." "Yours may be the wisdom of the foolish, but it con- founds the wise. You have made a very clear reply, if not a very conscious one, and defined your sensations quite to my satisfaction. We'll set that down to the credit of soul -intelligence being only a supposed quantity. Now I'll prove to you, little woman, that you are, notwithstanding, quitef as wise as the wisest man in the world. When you do not drown yourself, you are quietly submitting to an evil which you have no power to amend. That is a great evidence of wisdom, and one of the first lessons in moral philosophy. You have learned that without my assistance: now let me teach you how little the things you envy have to do with happiness." He glanced at the bare foot, and thought how extremely he should dislike putting his philosophy to so severe a test. "So you do not like the Prince?" he added, abruptly, as he saw that he had teased her quite as much as was proper. "Where did you get a book so unsuited to your compre- hension, and how' came you by a training so unfitted to your daily life?"   IN A CRUCIBLE.         89 "I borrowed it, Sir. I thought it was a fairy-tale. I like them and have read any number of them." Allan took the book from her hand and turned to the fly- leaf, on which was written, in a well-known hand: "Arthur Moreton, 1846." He leaned back against a tree, settled himself with an emphatic shrug, and gave a long, expres- sive whistle. "So, Mr. Moreton gave you this book, eh? Did he often lend you books?"' "Yes; I was allowed to take any I pleased, if I kept them clean and returned them. Will you please tell me how to get this back to him? He's gone away from here, and we've got another man. I wish Mr. Moreton had stayed." "Were you fond of Mr. Moreton?" "Yes, Sir; he was a good man, especially to poor people: they all liked him. Are you the new minister?" she ques- tioned, suddenly. "Yes," said Allan; " what do you think of me?" She settled her face into a look of grave, shrewd scruti- ny, under which Allan felt more discomfited than he could have believed possible, when he put his laughing query. She was reading him with that shrewd, intuitive knowledge that belongs to the uneducated classes-a light from which we are apt to shrink, as coming too directly from nature, to be favorable to a flattering portraiture-accustomed to being viewed, or to viewing ourselves, under the chiara- oscuro of conventional good-breeding. He watched the changes that fluctuated over the childish countenance, until she drew a long breath, and delivered her ultimatum: "I like you; but I don't think you are as good as Mr. Moreton." "Umph!" said Allan; '" a very questionable verdict! My friend Arthur's looks would not impress one very favorably with an idea of his sanctity."   90         IN A CRUCIBLE. The girl looked at him, but seemingly without compre. hension. "May I bring the book to you?" she asked. "'No," said Allan, rather quickly; "you need do nothing of the sort." Then seeing her flush angrily, he continued: "I will send you as many fairy-tales as you like; but I advise you to give up reading trash. What ought you to be doing now?" She looked sullen, and turned from him. "I don't want your books," she cried, passionately. "I don't like you either; you are proud and cruel, because I am poor." The foot came up dripping out of the water, and before Fenwick could recover his surprise, she had gathered her- self up and ran off down the river. Then Fenwick began rating himself soundly for his un- clerical behavior. The girl was half in the right; and, having asked her opinion of him, he had no right to take offence at this unqualified expression of it. Then he thought of Arthur. "Strong, old head," he muttered; "he's twice as capable of taking care of himself as I am: twice as fitted to honor his profession " and Fenwick sighed remorsefully. Blundering into his study, with no very amiable com- ments on the topography of Mrs. Burton's interior lodgings, Allan met an unexpected surprise. Scraping his lucifers against the chimney-piece, and still further aggravated by their provoking persistency in refusing to ignite, he hears a -laugh that he knows right well, and with a sudden dart at the armchair, drops the box of lucifers on the floor. After a moment of confusion, and a protest against the vio- lence of his reception on the part of the intruder, Fenwick strikes a light and scans Arthur's homely face with a look of the most intense delight.   IN A CRUCIBLE.         91 "Just in time, as usual. I've been at it again; and if it had not been for this, should have gone to bed in the most cursed humor imaginable., Just think of being twitted by a chit of fifteen; and all my own fault!" Arthur shook his head, and smiled: "We'll have the tea first, Allan, as you once told me; then you may unburden your miad."   CHAPTER X. THE END OF A VERY TANGLED THREAD; OR PEASANT AND PRIEST. "There are points from which we can command our life; When the soul sweeps the future like a glass, And coming things, full freighted with our fate, Just out, dark, on the 0ffing of the mind." Festus. "I AM not sure," began Allan, between sips of hot tea, "that I cannot lay the blame on you, this time." "Well?" questioned Arthur. "You are terribly in fault, " resumed Allan, working himself up: "the idea, of permitting a girl like that to come gleaning, d discretion, out of your library-! All a chance if she don't imbibe poison; and no thanks to you. Will you never learn to see through any glass but that of self? A bad enough lens for any profession-terribly so for ours." "What is the mischief now?"' said Arthur. "I'm all in the dark, you know: though I suppose you are talking of Susan Warner."  "Indeed! then you are waking up. My dear fellow, if  you have trained this parish up solely with a view to your own requirements, why, in Heaven's name, didn't you stick to it and pilot them through? If you meant to forsake them, I should think some broad principles applying to general humanity would have made a more striking exemplification of your wisdom, and of consideration for your successor." 92   IN A CRUCIBLE.         93 "Come, Allan; let us have the point to this tirade, which at present I do not see." "Of course not," retorted Allan; " but if you were not so terribly engrossed with your own Ego, you would see. You'd see that such a course would not have been the wisest for any coarse-limbed servant-girl in the country- doubly wrong and foolish for that dainty specimen; already raised, by her extreme beauty and delicacy, above her class -most likely to come to harm, as it is; certain -to do so under your refining process. -Only pure metals are worth putting into a crucible; and this girl is not gold, you know." "Come," said Arthur; " since you take this view of it, I will tell you that I thought her want of mind would prove her safeguard: she was not likely to make such selec- tion as would harm her. Indeed," he said, coloring slightly, "I am afraid I did not think much about it." Allan was beginning to be mollified, since -Arthur so readily admitted himself in error; quite elated, too, at find- ing himself for once in the character of Mentor. He shook his head. "Never was a wiser clause inserted in anything, than that short sentence, deliver us from temptation!' You can- not appreciate it, old boy; but weak natures like mine, that have so often shivered on the brink, and sometimes toppled over, know where safety lies. Don't think, because you can thrust your obstinate head into danger and defy the powers that be, that many can; and you've got to watch for them." Arthur was silent: Allan's words came to him with force. Had he too much concern for his own soul? Allan saw that his speech had taken effect, and resumed: "You have got me into a predicament. You see, it is quite out of the question that I should have that little   '94        IN A CRUCIBLE. creature hanging about my room. You might bury your. self in your books for half a day, while she went dipping into your shelves; but I should be studying Rembrandt lights on her hair, and doing a thousand unclerical things that I ought not. I should be constantly forgetting she was not a pretty child that wanted petting. There is no use mincing matters, you know. I am only too conscious of my short-comings; and so, I am afraid, are you." There was unmistakable worry in his usually pleasant voice and on his handsome face; and Arthur rose, and paced the room thoughtfully. "My usefulness to her too is at an end. How can I bring her to a sense of all this without harm?" Arthur stopped short, looking the picture of dismay Practical lessons are, after all, the best for some natures. His sense might be slow to gather up skeins of complicated meanings; but here was a dilemma, whose unmistakable evil told home to him with force. He knew Fenwick was right,-right in every word he uttered!"I don't trust that girl," Fenwick went on. "There was any amount of passionate ugliness in her face when she flung herself up from the bank, and turned on me. It reminded me of a Swiss lake, on a summer evening-smiling, placid, seductive --blinding one to the treacherous death that lay at the bottom, until the sudden swoop of the mountain wind dashedinto its bosom: then, see it boil and seethe, with the wrath of a thousand devils-the surface all dimmed and distorted with the clouds that lowered over its bosom." "You are judging hastily and passionately," siad Arthur quietly; "you must trust yourself this once, Allan, there is no other way. I cannot come back here; that is out of the question. You have assumed a responsibility, which, I know, you will not shirk. She is one of your charges; a very golemn one, if your passionate denuncia- ^@  I'      -    IN A CRUCIBLE.         95 tion be true. I have been terribly to blame--terribly self- absorbed; but there is not so much of the Ego as you think, dear friend. I have been walking face to face with a great trouble, and, God forgive me, have erred in being blind to my duty. If I could see any way out of this, I would not say trust yourself; nor do I now. Trust in God." "I am not fit to be trusted, you need not be told that," said Allan, sullenly. "You are not to trust yourself," said Arthur, impatiently. "I am going to trust you, and there's some strength in that; , and you are to trust in God, and try to remember the sacredness of your calling." "That's all very well," said Allan, moodily, "but I'm all impulse, and in one second should very likely upset all the theories of the best theologians that I've been a life- time gathering up. You see I have always had an eye that they were more for the benefit of others than of myself; and have been brought up very sharply, sometimes with an ugly truth staring me out of countenance. One cannot go on blundering through life, and trusting to the cast of a die;  We cannot, at all events. I took up this thing to benefit others, not myself. 'Are not many souls of more value than one?' Yet if, as in this instance, the one be lost, what becomes of my power over the many? You see, then, when such an emergency turns-up, I am bound, as it were, to look out for myself. The storm may blow over, the ship right herself, and with a hearty thankfulness for my own safety, I can cast an anchor to windward and strive for my shipmates." Arthur was again silent for some moments; then he came back, facing Allan, and said: "What, think you, -would be said of you or me, or any other man who shrank from a worldly danger? We would be branded as cowards in -the face of all men. Here is a   96         IN A CRUCIBLE. spiritual risk; shall He whom you serve brand you in the face of his angels?" "Spiritual, but closely allied to the flesh," muttered Allan, his sense of the humorous breaking out in spite of himself. "Allan, Allan," said Arthur, earnestly, '" what a sacred calling is ours-what a fearful responsibility! You say I have walked blindly, studying myself-not looking abroad. Perhaps it is true. I have studied myself, because it seemed to me that my own heart leld such a power of evil-such a compass of wrong-doing, that I dared not contemplate any- thing further. If that power was brought into subjection,. it gave me strength. It is a dangerous doctrine, that, through evil deeds-through temptation-our sight is quickened, our capabilities for good exalted; but, it is one which no clergyman has a right to overlook. We must challenge the powers of darkness: if we conquer, we can reach forth strong arms to bring fellow-sinners to us. If we have never sinned, we have no sympathy with those who sin. Sin never made us unworthy to serve Him, if we strive again to conquer. Allan, you must not turn cowardly-you must not." "There is nothing else left for me, I suppose; but I do not promise much. I'm no metaphysician, Arthur; but I have been endowed by nature with a gift which may have been intended as a blessing, or a curse--a gift of antipa- thies; and I am much of the opinion of Trismegistus, that we do not often enough heed them. I have a perfect re- pulsion to that girl. 'I cannot account to you for my re- luctance to have anything to do with her. I had as lief have you. ask me to take a bottled snake to my bosom. Faugh! you know how I hate reptiles;" and Allan's face expressed infinite disgust. "This girl is very beautiful, if I remember rightly," said 'Arthur, musingly. l   IN A CRUCIBLE. -        97 "Aye, so she is, so long as you'd pet and soothe her; but an ugly customer if you thwart her, if I mistake not. Strange, though, that I was quite fascinated by her until she turned ugly, and then, though I have seen many an angry child, I never had quite such a sensation as her pas- sion produced on me." "But she is not a child," urged Arthur. "Yes; and that is just the trouble, a very serious one. I should be constantly forgetting that. Besides, I've a ter- rible passion for beauty. If that little thing had not lost her temper, there is no saying what amount of naughti- ness she might not have been- guilty of, andegone unre- proved." "Perhaps it is well you have taken up this prejudice; though I am not sure it is not revenge for her honesty," said Arthur, smiling: " try and not forget it, Allan." "I had just such a turn once before," said Allan, unheeding: " it was in the Neapolitan gallery. I saw a woman faint at sight of a portrait. I had not noticed her until then; and I had the same repulsion, looking at her, that I had to this girl: yet, she would have been called by some a very handsome woman-certainly, nothing evil in her face." "And the portrait," said Arthur; " was that handsome, too?"  "The portrait :- oh, certainly; I never thought to notice particularly. I believe there was nothing striking about it. Johanna--that likeness with the wonderful eyes." "I remember it very well," said Arthur, slowly. "A beautiful face, with eyes looking out between marble pillars ; at-God knows what; but with an expression so prescient, so magnetic, that the horror would haunt your sleeping and waking hours for days!  Who, knowing her life and history, would care to put himself into sympathy with such 5   )8        'IN, A CRUCIBLE.' eyes? Yet I can, imagine that they would jar upon the nerves of a sensitive woman without any mysterious sym- pathy." "Perhaps so," said Fenwick, doubtingly; "but' I, in some way, connected that fit with the queenly eyes of that disgraceful monstrosity which the Neapolitans, to their shame, exhibit with so much pride. It struck me that a very pure-eyed, pure-hearted woman would not have en. tered so strongly into the conception of the artist." ; "Unfavorable premises upon which to found a prejudice; her knowledge of history, if she possessed any, would form the clue."  "You may be right; but that woman's face impressed itself upon my memory more strongly than the much more beautiful one of Johanua. -I could tell you to a T what she wore; I even remember a heavy onyx-seal that was suspended to her watch, and whose motto and crest struck my eye, in assisting to resuscitate her. On one side was a man crushing in his hand a bundle of writhing serpents, with the motto, 'omnia vincet;' on the reverse, a woman with her delicate heel on the head of the serpent, with the motto, 'spiritio vincet.' I did not know which motto she claimed by right," ended Fenwick, with a laugh. He was in a strange mood-a very unusual one; and Ar- thur looked at him wonderingly. Allan took a turn up and down the room, then continued: "At any rate, I know that when I smiled over the re- versed motto, perhaps a little sarcastically, she shrank away from my eyes with what I should have thought a fright- ened expression, only it seemed so unlikely." Arthur was much more interested in Fenwick's unusual mood than he was in the incident thatt seemed to have. ta- ken such a strong hold upon his imagination; yet he. said, arelessly, "And the woman-what was she like?"    'IN A CRUCIBLE.   . -    99 "The woman; oh, such as you see any number of among the Venetian painters: large-limbed, broad-shouldered, with a full bust, sloping waist, and delicate extremities: arched about the brow and chin; with sweeping curves, both in person and face. A look of sensuality in feature, person and high-coloring--such a type as they give to the' Mater-Dolorosa-with a singular art relieving the heavy, animal proportions, with a dash of spiritual and intellectual beauty about the brow and eye-an art that presents a re- ally startling feature, carried into lips that, full, scarlet, and sensual to a degree in themselves, are yet enthroned with the most saintly, spiritual grace conceivable-a spirituality not to be eclipsed by any expression of eye. I suppose the idea is, to present to us the most perfect union of phys- ical and spiritual nature in that type which, among women, has been given to us as the single example of its perfect unity. I do not apply all this to this woman: certainly, the spiritual nature seemed wonderfully blurred and dimmed to my prejudiced vision. But I am running into nonsense, It is more than likely that, being extremely sensitive to relulsions and sympathies myself, I misjudged this woman. Her weakness may have proceeded from heat, or any other incidental cause, and her proximity to the hideous portrait of the Babylonish woman, have been quite accidental. It is very unsafe to be running off into parallelograms of theo- retical probabilities or improbabilities, where our charitable judgment is involved,; and, if you. will allow me, we will drop into a pleasanter channel of talk. You will remain some days?" "No; I must return to-morrow," said Arthur: but his speech was slow and labored. He was troubled by a vague analogy in Fenwick's description--an analogy he was loth to admit. He strove to banish it, as he sat watching the spark that brightened a: perceptibly limited circle in the : l   100          IN A CRUCIBLE.                , gathering darkness-tried to bring his thoughts back to homely, healthful things-to remember that that spark was the end of Allan's fragrant Havana; and that somewhere in the gloom, the smoke was curling upward-upward to the light, though he could not see it for the darkness!  -' ?   iCHAPTER XI. r       RPAROLET S LEGACY. "By what stirs he every heart? By what subdues he every element? Is it not the harmony which bursts from out his breast and sucks the world back again into his heart? When Nature, carelessly winding, forces the thread's intermina. ble length upon the spindle; when the confused multitude of all Beings jangles out of tune and harsh,--ho, life-infusing, so disposes the ever equably-flowing series that it moves rhythmically? Who calls the Individual to the general conse- cration, where it strikes in glorious accords? Who bids the tempest rage to pas sions? the evening-red glow in the pensive spirit?", Goethe. IT was Parolet's last night in her own home. Recent events had rendered it probable that New Orleans would be the next point of attack; and a letter from Capt. Trevor had confirmed her intention of seeking some place of greater seclusion, and which would afford her greater protection. She had selected St. Bevins; first, from the advantages its quietude offered; secondly, because, though its associations were anything but pleasant, it had been the home of her childhood, and she clung to it with that strong feeling of habitude that forms a part of every woman's nature. As the evening gathered in, her labors were brought to a close, and she wandered   sadly through the dismantled rooms, overpowered with a sense of loneliness. The air was oppressive, as if burdened with coming storm, and walking to the open window, she stood watch- ing the masses of cloud that were piling up against the setting sun. Listening, she could; hear the faint shivering of the wind that rushed overhead; first, with a whispering moan-then, in a sudden? sharp gust, that rifted the clouds asunder, sweeping away in a wild blast, and lost in the- echoes from the street. Broad flashes of lightning glim- 101   102 /       IN A CRUCIBLE. mered over the face of the heavens; and then, with her head bent down in her hands, Parolet heard the hoarse swashing of the rain as it came down in a'steady torrent. Was her temperament wrought into sympathy with the elements? or was it one of her moods of unaccountable . depression, when her whole system seemed to relax-her  ; mental, physical, and moral being seeming to fall into a 1 state of lassitude,--a phase of existence which no man can either understand or sympathize with; one, under the in- fluence of which, a woman would be capable of acts from which, in her ordinary stage of being, she would shrink appalled. Beware of temptation falling upon a woman's life at such a moment. The springs of her nature are weakened by some organic influence, which she either feebly combats, or to which she yields with a despairing, helpless sense that her moral rectitude has failed her through sympathy with her physical being.  In weak natures, and where moral rectitude is never at a very high estimate, and .mental vigor wanting, such organic tendencies wear themselves off in fretful, nervous irrita- bility, for which a wise physician will physic the body. In strong natures, presenting the antithesis in all points, I should say-stimulate the intelligence, absorb the moral tendencies in such a manner as will bring them into direct corpmunion with the leading principle of mind and will, and the body will right itself. In this woman, whom I have selected as presenting more -than the ordinary number of salient points, a close ob- server might have traced two natures, separate and dis- tinct, both nicely balanced, both acted upon by what- seemed destructive organic tendencies, neither preponder- ating, but both-coming alternately into play, and, for the time, acting in perfect sympathy with all its parts. Was the evil nature predominant to-night? I think so. Stand-      IN A CRUCIBLE.         103 ing with her head bent down, her startling outlines brought fully into observation, you could not fail to be struck with the complete corresponding evidence in face, attitude, and expression. There was a hard immobility in feature, a defiant harshness in the attitude, that set all your faculties into active play to trace out the type. Century after century we see them reproduced. Gener- ation after generation come, moving figures upon the arena of life, and we are startled at the similitude to some pre- conceived image of what--soul? Has not every swarthy- browed voluptuary, perfect in physique, faultless in person, painfully deficient in mental or moral supremacy, found its type in Cleopatra? Can we not see a Semiramis in the bold voluptuary, whose animal passions are stimulated by an intelligence cold and cutting as an Arctic iceberg? A Zenobia, in one whose tempered characteristics are per- vaned by a subtleAarmony of being, and before which we boj the head and pay tribute? Has not every age of events its Caesar, Napoleon, Alexander? Life is a perfect circle--its nucleus, humanity. There are subtle threads which fine eyes may trace from its broad outer circumfer- ence of commonplace truisms, and upon which hang, God, knows what of good or ill to us. I would stay the rash hand that would venture to draw  rudely upon a fibre so frail, lest he involve it in hopeless entanglement; yet, if through prescience or self-consciousness we gather up these fibres, shall we not trace them even unto the end? Years ago, this woman, with a power of divination stimulated by adverse circumstances, had looked at herself calmly, and learned that from which a weaker nature would have turned shudderingly, or under which it would have sunk sinfully. She had done neither. To-night, with the power of her better self quenched in a sullen gulf of despondency, with all her brighter humaui-                ,   104        IN A CRUCIBLE. ties crushed out and obliterated, she shut her ears to out- side influences, and paced restlessly backward and forward, until compelled, in very weariness, to pause. Fatigue was softening her somewhat, for she turned, with a feeble ef- fort of self-forgetfulness, to the book-shelves, and drew forth a volume at hap-hazard. It was not a wise venture. With the tempest raging outside, and the sullen influence within, no need to heighten her imagination with the weird enchantment that from her childish days had clung around that quaint recital of terrible wrong and suffering, tortured humanity. Turning a page here and there, glancing at the familiar words with a sense so self-absorbed that it was rendered numb to their meaning, a slip of paper fluttered slowly out on her lap, and rustled to the floor. She had not noticed it. A sudden burst of the tempest startled her to her feet, and she sprang to the casement. Flash after flash blinded her eyes, disclosing masses of cloud, and with each illumi- nation opened up vast spaces into infinitude. The atmos- phere only seemed heavier as the minutes wore away, and in the intervals of darkness she felt as if, raising her hand, it must come in contact with that stifling pall of darkness and terror. Simultaneously with the flashes of light, the howl- ing of the wind, and the steady rush of the rain, there came a sudden crashing of hail. With this fearful chorus of the elements bewildering her terrified senses, Parolet staggered back to her chair, and covered her eyes with her hands. Gradually the fury of the tempest spent itself; the wind moaning away .over the housetops, dashing down the long, winding street, and soughing through the chimneys with a faint, shivering sound ; the thunder muttered off in the distance, the lightning played flickeringly over the faces of the watery clouds, and Parolet, with a strong *        IN A CRUCIBLE.         105 shudder of relief, uncovered her eyes and gathered up her numbed faculties. As she resumed her noiseless pacingover the carpet, her eye fell upon the slip of paper at her feet. It was Regi- nald's diagram, placed there by himself, and forgotten in the hurry of departure. Line by line, word by word, she went over it, standing under the light, with her hueless cheek and rigid attitude. Pressing her white finger on the words, "Intellect not the predominant development. Likely to be acted upon in a greater degree by moral or immoral tendencies; balance--questionable," 'she crushed the paper in her hand, and laughed a hard, bitter, scornful laugh. "Fool! and I thought I was guarding my secret so well! The acquaintance of an hour; and he has laid his hand e ruthlessly upon it.  Cruel! cruel and merciless!" she moaned. There was no name, no clue given; but there was no need to tell her that this was herself, she, who had amused llis leisure hours; and a bitter resentment sprang up in her heart against him. She had not seen the endorsement on the back; and coiling herself down on the floor under the lights, with the crumpled paper spread,out on her knee, she fell to thinking-thinking until her ,brain ached. Had she, made a mistake after all? Was she unable to- fight this thing out alone? Then her mind fell back into the old, oft-recurring, well- worn channel of the past eight years. - She was but a child then, with a poor, uncultivated minds an unformed charac- ter, with personal attractions for her dowry, and not a friend in the wide world!     I She remembered her father's death-bed, when he had shown some tenderness for her, and given her into the care of a husband--God help her!--before she had known   a or      *    [06        IN A CRUCIBLE lover,-to a man who had stood her father's friend in his last extremity, and who freely gave her his love and his protection. She had had no other resource, and even now could summon no regrets. He had never been very exi- gent in his demands, or it is possible she might not have had so much of quiet contentment in her lot. The last act of her father's life had been to place in her hands a packet of letters, saying as he did so, with a strange, wistful tenderness, "Your only legacy, Parolet." Then drawing her to him with a sudden passionate burst of emotion, imprinted a long, lingering kiss on her lips, and died. These letters, unfortunately, she never opened until several months after her marriage, when it was too late, she felt, to remedy the evil, if evil there was. Even then she had not taken in the full, terrible meaning conveyed in every line to her slow sense. When she did, the sickening terror that gathered in her eyes was terrible. Falling on her knees, she cried out, "Was it not enough without that i"A double misery was hers; and ah! she was so young-so young and so helpless! Towhom could she go-to her husband? Never! What a repayal of his generosity and kindness! It was better for him to remain in ignorance; and for her-what mattered? For a time she pored over those letters, until their con- tents seemed stamped on her brain in letters of fire. Year after year she had read them,-a deep sense of their mean- ing coming to her quickening sense with her unflinching, self-scrutiny. With a full knowledge of the facts, and of the danger to herself, she gathered up her energies, and determined to do battle for her birthright. With that first determined effort of will, exercised for good, came a quick- ening of all her powers--mental, moral, and consequently physical. The life she had led haa favored such develop- * ment. She had been subjected to trials, but they had served   only as a stimulus to the progressive development of her faculties. Free from the morbid influences of sentimental passion, the springs of her nature, strong and healthful, had kept the body in perfect harmony, through the usual chan- nels of sympathetic action. She had locked the letters away in her private cabinet, resolutely checked any recurrence to the painful thought they aroused, and determined to right herself, if possible, in the worldly consideration they involved-which was, after all, only a doubt-and leave the rest to Providence. With a sudden shbck, to-night, she had been thrown back to a self-communion-a rigid self-examination; and it had resulted-how? Had she gained in the contest? The scales yet wavered in the balance. Would circumstances work out this terrible enigma? She grew cowardly, with a sense of her impotence. Suddenly, she remembered Arthur Moreton-the only friend she had ever known at St. Bevins. She would see him; he could help her, in one particular at least. Would he befriend her? She would trust him, at any rate. She would go to him as a minister, and he must counsel her; for she was beginning to distrust herself. She took from her cabinet the package of letters-her bitter legacy! Again, with patieit, thoughtful eyes, she conned the tear- stained pages-pages over which the passionate outhurst of two womanly hearts had found vent! .She saw how, with patient unmurmuring lips, the feeble nervous fibre of a life had been fretted against the hard unsympathetic nature, until daily contact exhausted its powers, and the flame had flickered out forever. Yet, to this weak, gentle nature, with its feeble moral sense, she owed her salvation. To the strong unbending will of the father she owed the current of an energy that had ripened her moral instincts, making them fit to cope with the power of evil. Nature,    )8     fIN A CRUCIBLE. by one of her fixed laws, had righted her-righting, while she wronged. Filled with vague thoughts which, in her present state, she lacked energy to clothe in palpable form, she resumed her noiseless, restless pacing to and fro, while her garments swept the floor, with that stealthy, monotonous, trailing sound, that seemed one of the voices of the silent night- with the gas-lights flaring fitfully, while her shadow danced fantastically on the wall-now facing l;er in towering pro- portions, now flitting dim and indistinct in her rear, mock- ing her with its restless, unceasing motion, until the gray morning awoke. Turning down the lights, she stood again at the open casement, watching the faint rosy flushes in the east--cor- ruscations of orange light, melting into pale violet hues- until the quivering sun-rays broke through the veil of mist, and glimmered on her aching eyes. She bent forth eagerly, letting the soft breeze sweep the heavy tresses firom her brow. The storm of last night had vanished. Nature's teeming pulse throbbed with new life in its myriad veins. Her own languid pulse quickened into sympathy; the eyes brightened and softened, the graceful form grew pliant; and, looking at her in her softened aspect, you wondered what spell of a disordered fancy had led your mind away to thoughts of a crowded arena, where wild figures, with streaming hair, and all their femininities blotted out, have voiced the full, Greek choruses to the clamors of a multitude, to mocking phantoms of the Lorlie, lifting up haggard fa- ces from out their rocky shadows, and chanting seductive death. Had her own self-consciousness vanished? Nay; she was watching the broadening day with that elasticity of spirit that seemed to say, "There is no sin or sorrow in the world'of To-day! I bear with me no taint of Yesterday.   I am young Day-born out of the cradled East; and you are fit to tread the joyous hours with me. Out of the tempest of yesternight you have brought forth new re- solves-strong, patient, and earnest!' With far different feelings she had watched the quiet calm of declining day. With the golden light gathering in the westering sky, ever comes a humbling sense of our own unworthiness. The beauty that is closing to our eyes in the shadows of coming night, warns us that life too, with all its beauty, must close on the evening of existence, and saddens the heart while it elevates the senses. There is more of spirit- ual loveliness in the evening light-of material beauty in the morning landscape! The dreams, the unquiet longings of her girlhood, had been crushed with the monotony of an unloving and uneventful life, and left her a quiet, patient woman-standing in. the morning sunlight-with a courage roused to determination, and with a plodding, hopeful energy, that deserved success.   CHAPTER XII.

AN undisturbed leisure left Arthur Moreton ample time for study and meditation: nor were 'his, studious habits likely to be broken in upon by any family eruptions into his sanctum. The gloom and dust of the sombre-hued pic- ture was seldom relieved by incursions from  the drawing- room; nor was Arthur often enticed by the bursts of merry laughter, or the strains of music and song that floated up through the long evenings to his dim chamber.    Once or twice, since his quiet occupation of the next rooms, the door had opened noiselessly, and a bright apparition with floating draperies had stood, for an instant, on the thresh- old; then daintily picked its way through grim, theological folios, and all the grime and dust of a student's sanctum, poising lightly on the extreme edge of the baize-covered, ink-stained table, with delicate, slippered feet-resting on the arm of his chair. It was a glimpse of the brightness down- stairs; and Arthur welcomed it with a smile that lighted all his dull, heavy features, and made Edith's heart beat reproachfully, that she did not oftener run the risk of ink- stains on her bright silks and flowing muslins. He would listen to her pretty talk, stroke her soft silken tresses, on which a stray gleam  of light rested,-glad to find so at- "O  IN A CRUCIBnLE.        1" tractive an object,-trying, with comical earnestness, to bring himself into some sort of sympathy with this pretty, soulless trifler; wondering what sort of light it was that shone in those blue eyes, and whether they were, truly, the windows of her soul! It was a sweet enchantment to have womanly eyes looking into his labors; and find a white hand laid, with daring irreverence, on his favorite theologi- ans-sending the heavy tomes spinning into some dark corner, scattering loose leaves in every direction, raising a cloud of motes that had not dared the sunlight for many a day, and disturbing the patient labors of all the matronly spiders that had defied dusting-brooms and cobweb-brushes under the protecting nose of the absent-minded rector. He dared not linger on such pictures as his imagination con- jured up. The enchantment was stronger still, when, aftet a long day's work, with throbbing brow and aching eyes he bent over his table, a cool, soft hand was laid suddenly over them, and pale-faced, brown-eyed Constance bent her proud lips, and laid them lightly on his cheek. How gratefully he re- ceived the caress; how soothingly the influence of that low voice, so even in its tones, with silvery enunciation and cool modulations, fell upon his tired senses! There was something of sympathy here. Nearest in age, Constance, whose calm indifference many a neophyte in polite society had envied, had felt the current of her haughty blood flow quicker in sympathy with the strong, dark, passionate nature of her favorite brother. It was a feeling he had come to appreciate with few words on her part, and with a tacit thankfulness on his. With her quiet cold face and deli- cate outlines opposite him, he lapsed into sweet dreams of what it would have been, with a womanly face, divine with inspiration, lighting the dulness of Theophrastus or Theocritus; with the gentle influences stealing into his    [i2        IN A CRUCIBLE. heart, softening its humanities with a touch of velvet lips. Constance, vivified with his grateful imaginations, grew into strange beauty: beauty that belonged neither to her pure, Greek outlines, nor to her eight-and-twenty years; and which she would have scorned to claim. Unattractive with all her jne finish and high-breeding, Constance More- ton had a pitiful contempt for most female frailties. She neither claimed nor desired beauty; and held Edith's pretty coquetries as far beneath her own claims to calm intelligence. Hers was such a face as one might picture Hypatia's, addressing her audience in clear, unmoved strains of pure reasoning; scorning to sway their base passions with the chaste fires of divine eloquence-surveying their unresponsive faces with serene pity, and returning from her labors without 4iscouragement, satisfied that she had made proper returns to the vestal shrine whence she gathered her rays of supreme intelligence. So Constance, accepting the fact that her gifts were unappreciated by the society in which she moved, yet felt that she was paying only the required tribute to her own high personality, even though laying them as rejected fruits on the altar of position and family requirements. Accustomed, therefore, to occasional interruptions of this nature, Arthur, hearing a slight noise of entrance, only held out his hand, without looking up, with intent to add the last lines to an unfinished page of manuscript; but started violently, as a soft palm was laid in his, and rose precipi- tately from his seat. There was a door, opening into the grounds, through which visitors from the village, who desired to see the rec- tor on business, found ingress, and through which Arthur passed in his evening strolls, under the shadows of the great trees that dotted the lawn. Here, he loved to wander at   IN A CRUCIBLE.        113 sunset; lying on the long, tangled grass, with the panoramic view feeding his hungry %yes. Spotted fawns skipped about in the shadows; white rabbits with pink eyes and a look of suffering timidity in the nervous twitching of their noses, darted in and out among the shrubberies; brown-eyed deer drank timidly in the miniature lake, under whose clear sur- face scaly fish swam lazily, or sent up rainbow sprays in the evening sunlight: cosmopolitan creatures, gathered from all the streams in the surrounding country, and settling them- selves into a comfortable state of contented, fiscal existence in this limited sphere. His intruders through these grounds had been, for the most part, village urchins with a strange bird's-nest, brought to the rector with the hope of eliciting stray small coin; presuming more upon his good-nature and benevolent sym- pathy with this phase of boyhood, than upon their capabil- ity to palm off their wares as anything uncommon upon his scientific knowledge-of which they stood in no small awe. Sometimes it was a call upon his slender store of chemicals, for the ailments of some worthy individual, too poor to pay the doctor's fees; and on rare occasions, there had been a stamping of muddy boots on the threshold, with a simultaneous rush of cold air, and a faint smell of un- tanned cowskin, as some parish magistrate solicited the aid of Arthur's good sense in a case of difficulty. Never, within his recollection, had Chat door opened to admit a female form; which may account for the sudden upset of all the rector's faculties, the sudden dimness that blurred his vision and made the floor reel from under him. He offered none of the customary civilities. He stood at bay: the hand she had touched thrust rudely into his breast, and his dull features darkening with the ensanguined tide that flowed into them. With quiet composure she seated herself; forcing him to   "       IN A CRUCIBLE. do the same, without rudeness, of ich no Moreton could have been guilty, and then to wait itnt was her pleasure to speak. That she did, speedily. She was not a woman to ward off, for a moment, even the sharpest blow. She would gather herself up to meet it as best she might, and then-what 'hattered when or how it fell? While Arthur was making a mental protest against cir- cumstances, and having a dismayed feeling of helplessness, thinking that he had put out his hand impotently to ward off all-the miseries of years ago, the same voice that he re- membered so well broke upon his ear, bringing him back, with its clear ringing inflections, to present things, and forcing him to collect his faculties. "Mr. Moreton, have you aly belief in inherited qualities?" This was her greeting, after eight years of separation- of agony-of vain endeavor to trample down the strong passions of his manhood. Yet even then, with the knowl- edge that she was sitting composedly, waiting his reply, he could not but be struck, by its strangeness, with the thought, how unlike every other woman she was whom he had ever known. She had spoken without greeting of any sort, beyond the quiet pressure of his hand; as if they had parted but that morning-as if all the years had faded away, and she, in some busy thought of himself, had lapsed into forgetfulness of their passage. It was neither 'Eiith's nor Constance's face that turned its clear outlines against the dark walls of his chamber. It was that for whose strange, magnetic beauty he had yearned all the weary years. The voice was that of the siren-luring him again to forget his duty to his God, to himself, and to her.  With a wonderful power of self-command, he remembered who and what she was; not his love-not the passionate creation of his youthful heart, but--a wife! What a power   man wields in habitude! Bring but the passions into sub- jection, and slowly, wtth breathless interest, we see the wavering scale settle into a perfect balance. What if chance lower that into which are cast the evil passions of our nature; can we not fling all the weight of will and self- command into the opposing scale? With all our moral tendencies bearing up under this strong lever, come troop- ing the beautifying influences of unselfish thoughtfulness, charity, and peace; making the perfect circle of-only human perfection after all-! It has taken a long time to de- scribe what passed through Mr. Moreton's mind; yet, in reality, but few moments had elapsed, before he brought himself to meet the questioning eyes bent searchingly upon him. "I am not prepared to answer your question: it is one involving much, if applied to our moral and religious re- sponsibility. As a minister of God, I should hesitate before replying to such a query, put in idle curiosity, or with, per- haps, a worse intent." It was not a polite response; nor one which a man, acting under a less heavy sense of responsibility, would have been likely to make. "Your caution is commendable: I can appreciate the feeling which has governed your reply; yet I can honestly disclaim both curiosity and evil intent. If the former, it had been easily solved with inquiry into any of the authors who are so kindly holding out the glass to us, in which we may, without the aid of prophetic warning, behold ourselves in any mist of moral irresponsibility we choose: if the latter, it would furnish no bright exemplification of my wisdom to propound such an inquiry at present. Forewarned is fore-armed! I come to you in a case of grave doubt to myself; and as a minister, whose duty it is to give what of comfort lies in his power, to all who seek it."   "6        IN A CRUCIBLTE. She was asking comfort of one who would have given his very life for her happiness; but she could hardly guess this, listening to his measured tones. "Then I am bound to listen to you, if you speak frankly; and I will give you my conscientious opinion. I am in- clined to accept the theories of certain authors on this subject. I have been brought to acquiesce, no less by arguments, strong and conclusive in such hands, than through personal experience. It is needless to say, on the other hand, that I do not ignore moral, and still more, religious responsibility. Does this-satisfy you?" She made no answer. She was busy with self-examina- tion. Was not this her own conscientious belief? Why else had she struggled to right herself? After a pause, she said: "You allude to a theory of moral irresponsibility, resting upon material causes: this would seem natural enough, though it is not one such as I would cite. Do you not realize a probability that the same effects may be brought about without the existence of any known cause?" "I certainly incline to that belief; though it may be that we have not patiently traced up the existence of the cause. Who may say in how many generations inherited qualities die out? We know, by estimation, through how many generations a mixed blood becomes extinct; but, even here, the estimate is not correct, for how much is owing to mixed relations in the marriage state! We are not likely to arrive at any more accurate knowledge by a study of family inter- marriages, for it is a well-authenticated fact, that inherited defects are only deepened by such a course. Seeing that all research but leads to hopeless entanglement, I would say that, unless some stringent reason exists, it would be wiser to let such matters rest," "But if I say that in my own case such reason does exist, you will pardon my persistency?"   IN A CRUCIBLE.         117 "Of this, certainly, you must be the best judge; but there seems to me no such urgent motive: you are child- less, therefore your apprehensions do not extend beyond yourself. Can you not summon to your aid such religious faith as I would fain believe lies at the bottom of all wor- thiness? As to your husband, you need not be taught vour duty there. I am, of course, in ignorance of your domestic relations, nor would I voluntarily seek enlighten- ment. All revelations of family history are unwise; even to your minister. I do not stand in that relation to you; yet, since you have sought my counsel, I am bound to ren- der it."          ' It was very unpalatable--if wholesome; its unsavory harshness unrelieved by the slightest softening of tone or manner. But Parolet knew him well enough to feel that her trust was not misplaced; nor would her confidence be in the slightest degree abused. She would sooner have made such an appeal to him than to any living man; though she replied somewhat shortly: "Nor are you likely to be favored with any. This mat- ter relates much more nearly to myself than to any one else, though it is barely possible that I might not always remain childless. It is needless to say, that bad I earlier possessed the knowledge lately gained, I had not incurred the risk of transmitting such an inheritance. It is a sense of responsibility weighing fearfully upon me at times: can you blame me that I have turned cowardly at last, and sought your aid as a friend, no less than as a minister?" There was a slight flush on her cheek as she made this speech, and a wistful look in the clear, gray eyes, that tried Arthur's resolution sorely. He was forcing himself, through all, to speak in slow, measured tones, that held their chill- ing influence upon himself no less than upon her. He could never face such looks as these; and he was beginning to   "8        IN A CRUCIBLE. wish the delicious torture would end, and he could be re. moved from her presence. "I dare not permit myself to indulge any fond, sweet hopes of maternity: I dare scarcely solicit my husband's affection-knowing how blindly it is given. Ibhave never sought compassion, Mr. Moreton, at the hands of any; yet I am but a pitiful object after all; one who ought' gladly to exchange a lineage even as brilliant as mine-with such a cloud resting upon it-for the veriest mess of pottage. Will you burden yourself with enough of my confidence to read these letters? They may help you to a just answer. Ah! be just, Mr. Moreton-I ask only that. Do not lose sight of that bitter legacy bequeathed to me, through God knows how many ages. Its proud claims to the lustre of historical name cannot blind you to its baleful burden more than it has me. Woven with the glowing memories of our history, it has won chivalric honor in a foreign court -an honor, blurred and dimmed to all moral sense, with a curse that shall only die out with my life. Can you won- der if some strange fascination haunts me to end existence, lest it be marred in its'fair- proportions? Read them, and you will learn how one at least, grander to my eyes for the 1 act, laid down the weary burden of a sin-haunted life, soon- er than trust his frail morality with the chance of such transmission. Coward! you will say, since he could not bear the prison-life of an existence barren of all joy: -but you have never faced such a misery; you know not what it is." She had bent forward, clasping her hands in front of her, and bringing her face on a level with his: a face in which might be read the upheaving passions of a lifetime; pride, impetuosity, and apprehension, smitten with the rod of dominant self-will, and spurning the bright influences until they shrank under the tempest.   IN A CRUCIBLE.         19 Mechanically, Arthur took the package from her hand; then a long silence followed; unbroken save by the rustle of the papers, and the sharp, audible respiration of the woman who watched him-watched, while she saw, by turns, flitting over his face, compassion, scorn, repulsion! It ended at last! ended, with a silence infinitely more oppressive: a silence which she dared not break, lest she learned how much of the sentiment her keen eyes had divined, was given to her. This, too, came to an end, and then, with a lsense of relief, she saw him rise and come round to her side. He said: "I will not say that I pity you; for I believe you are worthy of some better feeling -than compassion. Shall I say that in spite of this knowledge, I trust you-that I always shall, unless I have the evidence from your own lips and from your conduct that my trust has been misplaced. You have acted wisely in making no revelation.' In this knowledge, coming too late to prevent a fatal mistake, you may be held wholly blameless. What remains is, for you to make the best use of the strength that has been be- queathed to you, even through a sinful nature; and to pray for the faith that has, as yet, been denied you: trust me, it will be granted in answer to prayer. Should freedom ever come, beware how you lose sight of this terrible warning, All seems dark to you, but remember 'we are seeing through a glass darkly.' Never lose sight of that, in reck- less despair at even a failure. If human sympathy can avail you aught, it is yours. I will assist you in all that lies in my power. You may rest contented with this assu- rance; seek elsewhere the aid which I cannot give, yet to which it is my duty to refer you." With a strange, soothing content she had listened to his words. So far, at least, she had done wisely and well; he would trust her for the balance. Could she bellie that trust,   120         IN A CRUCIBLE. even if tempted to be untrue to herself? Two lives besides her own now held her secret in trust; and, from this hour, there could be no question of relaxing her vigilance. She had done wisely in putting it into safer hands than her own --safer and stronger. When he had done speaking, he took her two hands in his, folded them lightly and tenderly, and Parolet knew that this was her dismissal. He would not trust himself to more, but opened the door, and allowed her to depart in silence; then he bowed his face upon his hands and shivered with some strong emotion. Ah! the glass through which he had looked so long, was blurred and dimmed with a shadow through which he could see himself no more. His Ego was vanishing slowly; stronger sympathies claimed him-stringent calls upon his humanity, which he dared no longer question. i o  .      .              .   CHAPTER XIII. FOLLOWING THE THREAD. "Delusion ishe life we live, And knowledge death-Oh, wherefore, then, To sight the coming evils give, And lift the vail of Fate to Men? Take back the clear and awful mirror, Shut from mine eyes the blood-red glare; Thy truth is but a gift of terror When mortal lips declare. My blindness give to me once more-- The gay dim senses that rejoice; The Past's delighted songs are o'er n For lips that speak a Prophet's voice." Schiller. THERE were lights in the drawing-room at St. Bevins, on an early autumn evening in 1863. The great chandeliers were all a-flame, and ruddy gleams from the firelight chased the' pale amber rays that quivered out from the glass jets. I Outside,     the whie moonlight bathed the lawn, and sent its pale gleam, striving lo pierce the heavy draperies that i closed the long row of french-windows. Over the bright I roses, whose glories Edith's dainty feet .had trampled in her passionate disdain, floated once more the amber-hued curls, and sapphire eyes gleaming with more than their wonted brightness, listening to Fenwick's gay sallies; and Arthur, blinking at the sudden blaze of light, recognized other forms and faces familiarly, as he stood in the doorway. The air was fresh, and pleasantly odorous with the breath of hothouse blossoms; and   music rippled out in silvery Wavesunder the light fingers of Constance Mdoreton, who sat alone at thie , piao, wandering fitfullyO throuigh familiar I 6       121   122        IN A CRUCIBLE. strains, and only turning her slender throat to beckon him with her eyes to her side. He was looking his last for many months, perhaps years, on the home-scene: home-yet which, with all its bright features, presented so little of homely warmth. He looked admiringly at his sisters,-Edith in her attractive loveliness, her gay, careless pride, trampling human affections under foot as ruthlessly as her slippered feet 'pressed the roses beneath them; yet whose blue orbs were the only Moreton eyes in which tears were ever seen to gather,--Constance, with her colorless oval cheek, and clear eyes-making so faultless a picture-shrouded in grave coloring, with only the slender, lace-encircled hands and throat to relieve the coldness of the drawing,-the mother, with her stately, old- time grace, and all the beauty of the haughty Moretons in her matronly face. It was not easy to break in upon such a family party at any time with abrupt disclosures; and he had a sensitive consciousness that the discomposure caused by his announcement would not be overlooked in the pain of his departure. Constance, he knew, would miss him: he would tell her of it first; not now, but some time during the evening. He seated himself quietly at her side; watched the rapid play of her fingers as they flashed over the ivory keys; listened dreamily to the broken snatches of melody that would float in his ears, when he was toiling patiently in another land for the tangled thread that was to clear up a wofill burden. That was his mission. He had no part in the brightness of life; even now, he was Working, in spirit, at that harsh problem that had been unfolded to him. He was thinking how sweet labor and self-exile would be for her sake; rousing up to remember that he would do the same for any other-striving to put from him the boon of her reward- a smile-whispered thanks-a touch of her hand. What   IN A CRUCIBLE.        '123 right had he to such thoughts? Ah!- the music, and laugh- ter, and light were for others-not for him-not hers, at least! Would he ever win light elsewhere? He was be- ginning to doubt once more. Never in her presence. She was filling his thoughts--was winning him to her--was thrusting herself between him and holiness. Of what else had he thought, since she had come to him in her sorrow? Of what else but that sorrow, and the guilty hope that /e would be instrumental in .bringing her comfort-if not happiness? He was contemplating this journey with no reluctance: with rather a strange, eager desire to begin a life of service to her; though he was turning his back on his country in her hour of dire distress,-not remembering that his life was vowed to a higher service. Could he shut his eyes to the truth, that in his weary night-vigils, with fervent prayers on his lips, her face was stamped on the mirror of his closed eyes--her voice whispering in his ear dreams of human happiness and human love? Then the chime of some half- forgotten lines stole on his memory, with the melody Con- stance evoked: "Evil into the mind of God or man, may come and go so unapproved, and leave no spot or blame behind." Was it unapproved? Priest of God! was he stumbling blindly into self-delusion? Nay; he must fly. Once more he must put space between himself and this woman; lest he betray his Maker, and those who trusted in him. Here he looked at Fenwick. His fair face was lighted up--the unrepressed drollery waking to the gleeful mischief in his eye, and all the light-hearted happiness of a boy breaking out in speech and manner. This man was his senior by many years; who would have guessed it? This was the face he had seen lifted in impassioned fervor with the solemn light of religious feeling darkeniig-Iover it-   124        IN A CRUCIBLE. with the quiet cathedral shadows from the stained-glass windows in the chancel falling upon it, and upon the slen- der, uplifted hands invoking the blessing of the Most High upon all men; upon him, among the rest. Would the benediction descend, in answer to that friendly prayer? Had a child lisped a blessing upon his head, Arthur More- ton would have felt that, in some way, it would descend, lifting the burden that ofttimes pressed wearily upon him. So he felt, looking at Fenwick, that in some way the bless- ing invoked would follow, though only asked for him, in common with many others. He felt soothed at the thought. Then, he feasted his eyes on that happy face, gazing at it with a pleasant smile-a smile full of softened, wistful tenderness for the friend of his boyhood: looked, little dreaming that it was the last time he should ever behold its unclouded happiness; that when next they met, he would fail to recognize, in the haggard eye and frozen cheek, the laughing face that bent over Edith's. He had been too much engrossed to notice any arrival, and-started as Trevor's loud voice jarred upon his reverie. Then his eyes turned to the door; and with a faint, giddy sensation, he saw her following. Constance, who had been looking only at him, turned too, followed the direction of his eyes, then, with a sudden light in her own, brought them back to his face. In an, instant Arthur's self-command returned to him. He met her gaze unflinchingly, endured the questioning torture long enough to lull any suddenly aroused- suspicion, then turned, and crossed the room to his mother's chair; walking steadily, though a sudden faintness was blinding his filmy eyes; for he knew a pair, keen as a northeast wind, was watching him relentlessly-ready to mete out scorn, not compassion, for his weakness. Oh for the boyish days, when he had no griefs that might not be sobbed away on that ample lap! There was   IN A CRUCIBLE.         125 comfort in that presence, if not of a motherly nature; and his pulse grew slow under the protecting shade of those serene eyes; and his sight strong, With the touch of the cool, plump palm. Her commanding presence awed him now, as it always had; even in his wild outhursts of passion, his stout, boyish heart had quailed under an eye over whose unmoved serenity he had never beheld even a flitting cloud of ill-humor or unwomanly emotion. It had held in check even the more wayward spirits that jarred discordantly sometimes on the family harmony, and it was little wonder that it held sway long after the stout forms had grown to manhood, and the moody passions of mature age had suc- ceeded the childish outhreaks of youth. Constance's gaze was removed the instant he sank on that low seat at his mother's feet, and the protecting palm was laid on his hot brow. There was a long interval, when he lost all that was pass- ing around him-all, but the consciousness of her presence; which he was striving to forget, while he went over in his mind the form of words in which he would break- his news to Constance. Here he looked toward her, but missed her; and in her place, with the full blaze of the chandeliers on her face, and her white hands folded on her lap, he beheld Parolet. Was it accidental, that she seemed always to challenge a strong light and fearless scrutiny? He remem- bered a thousand times when he -had seen that wonderful face turned to the strong lights of nature, or the glare of an artificial blaze; seen it, with eager lips, drinking in even- ing skies, while their- lurid lights flared before her, or turned wistfully to the east, that the first fresh sparkle might light upon her; and it pleased him to connect it with that brave strength, that dauntless courage that could never shrink from the eye of truth, though weaker natures would shun its unbecoming glare. Was her. fancy an instinctive   126        IN- A CRUCIBLE. turning to the light of Nature; of, perhaps, something better-of God--of religion? Suddenly, with a violent rebound, he sees Fenwick at his side, with a look of trouble on his face, while he whispers: "The woman of the Neapolitan gallery." Had the words really come to his ear? or was it only a vague distrust, stealing in in answer to his trustful fancy in the nature of this woman? He turnled his eyes in dreamy, bewildered fashion upon Fenwick, saw his lips syllable a repetition of the words, then turned them slowly, and with effort, upon the face under the lights. It was quiet, passionless, attentive; looking away from them, with a play of unspoken thought upon the full lips and in the dark eyes. The light must have been a strong one; for, with a dull, heavy thud, Arthur's heart seems to beat its labored respirations, as his searching eyes follow the idle motions of the slender hand, toying with-an onyx- seal. It is too far for his straining eye to catch either crest or motto. In another instant, moved by the fixedness of his gaze, or with some undefined uneasiness, she turns her head and meets Fenwick's face. Instantaneously, the play of the lips ceases, and-can it be fancy?-Arthur sees gath- er in the dark orbs the strange, half-defined look of-terror! Fenwick had well described it. She had dared the light of God and Nature; sheshrank, terror-stricken, under the light of the human eye. Was- it that the former had only addressed itself to her as a material form? Might it not be that she feared human scrutiny, only that it was so piti- less? Ah! in pity to himself came that thought. Then Arthur rose and reeled out into the cool, dark recess of the curtained window; out. of the stifling Batmosphere; and, flinging up the casement, bowed his hot temples on his hands until the rush of frosty air cooled the dull throbbing. The slow minutes slip by, and over the aching eyes a slen-   IN A, CRUCIBLE.        12 7 der hand sends its tremulous thrill, while Constance whis- pers: "4 What is it, Arthur?" He has not answered; the dull, sickening sense of misery -of a lost faith-is struggling in his breast-is crushing out all desire even for sympathy. But a few moments before, he was forgetting everything in dreams of active assistance to this woman; now, he was shutting out all trustful belief in her-he was admitting doubt into his breast--seting, over and over, the strange dilation of the pupils, into which he had gazed, craving for one gleam of hope, one denial in unconscious fearlessness; and he had seen her shrink, and grow cowardly: but he had seen no more. He had not seen her cross the room with her free sweeping motion, put forth her hand, and claim Fenwick's acquaintance, making some smiling allusion to their former meeting, He had not seen the repulsion in Fenwick's face which he could not conceal, while he seemed impelled, ix. spite of himself, and through some strange power in the woman, to accept the proffered hand, and recognize the footing of acquaintanceship upon which she placed him. Constance waited quietly at his side. She was never impatient; never obtruded her sympathy; had no idle curiosity.- She knew that Arthur was strongly moved, and had been inclined to connect it in some way with Mrs. Trevor; but she remembered his unflinching courage at her mute challenge, and that he had seemed moody and thoughtful before her arrival, when he sat listening to her music. She gave him time to recover himself, and to return to a belief in, and desire for, her sympathy. She was not fond of mysteries, which she always connected with some- thing disreputable, and was trying to bring her mind, as much as possible, to a prosaic solution of his trouble. After a little she repeated her question: "Sometting is troubling you, Arthur; will you tell me what it is?"   128 '       IN A CRUCTPMLE. "I am about to leave the country, Constance: this is my last evening for, perhaps, many years. Can you wonder that I am troubled?" he said, hurriedly. Constance was not deceived. She knew this was only a part of the truth; but she would not press the matter. He had left home oftenpn long leave, and with equal venture, and she had never seen him so moved. "You have selected an unfortunate time for your journey, Arthur; most likely you will have to bear the taunt of deserting your country in her hour of need; seeking peace at the expense of honor. I have never importuned you for motives, nor questioned your right to act independently; but these things fall heavily upon me, sometimes." There was a tinge of bitter feeling in her tone. Arthur was agitated; she knew it by his tmrried breathing, and by the oft-repeated gesture that had grown so familiar to her watchful eyes-the hand going up to the brow. "Constance," he said, hurriedly, "I can explain nothing to you now. I must only ask you to trust me still further. Surely, you know that no personal interest would lead me to desert my country. I must do my duty, if I gain only revilings; it has ever been the portion of them who serve Him, since the old days." He had finished in a far different tone from that in which he began his sentence; a tone of exultant feeling, that brought a faint tinge into the colorless cheek beside his own. He could win a crown of martyrdom--this great stalwart brother of hers, with a spirit as dauntless as his frame was strong! There was a fluttering pause, during which a flash went out of Arthur's eyes into hers; then he put out his arm and drew her nearer to him. After a moment, she said: ",Of course, I trust you, as blindly as we all must, it seems."   IN A CRUCIBLE         1 There was a slight emphasis on the word must, and the tone would have sounded cold to a third party; but Ar- thur knew it was not so intended. After a silence, she said, hurriedly, and with short pauses between: "Arthur, I do trust you; not quite as the rest do-be- cause you leave them no alternative-not that my faith goes with the family honors, either; but, but-" Here her voice faltered for an instant; she paused, recov- ered herself, and finished more calmly: "I think I am beginning to understand why you assumed the ministry. Will you forgive me, that I once sneered with the rest?" There was a glad brightness in Arthur's eyes as he bent them on her. This was his drop of comfort after the cruel blow of the evening, "Thank you," he said,; " do you know that at one time this evening I was doubting whether I ought to assume this task, because it seemed so sweet? I thought it must devolve on some one else; but my path is quite plain now. The sweetness has been dashed, perhaps providentially, and I know that I shall only be following a hard, dry sense of duty. My most painful thought in connection with depart- ule, Constance, was how to break it to you. You have helped me out, as you often do; shall I thank you again?" He bent down and pressed his lips to her forehead. The pale cheek flushed with painful pleasure under his unwonted tenderness and praise. She lingered, silently, for a few seconds, suffered herself to rest in his embrace, with her pure face turned toward him, then raised the curtain and passed back into the lights, with a happy contentment on her countenance, and a soft- ness in her placid motions, very unusual. Af'ter a few moments Arthur followed her. He found the grouping somewhat -altered. Parolet was still under 6*   130        IN A CRUCIBLE. the lights, but with her profile only turned toward him; with her hands lying listlessly on her lap, and appearing unconnected with the group at the fire. They had gathered around Trevor, who stood in the ruddy light, with his back to the fire, relating camp anecdotes with great volubility. As he came into the room, he gathered that Reginald was the subject under discussion; as Edith had drawn quite near, and was listening with pleased attention, while the mother's face expressed pride and satisfaction, and on Con- stance's pale cheek the pink flush' sprang anew. "Is he popular?"Edith was saying. "Popular! Not at all, Miss Edith, none of you More- tons are; too confoundedly proud, and set up. Not even you, for all your pretty ways: mighty condescending just now, when you want me to open my budget," and Trevor laughed loudly. "Which, of course, you intend to do," she said saucily, laying her hand with a little appealing gesture on his arm. "Humph! to feed your vanity; quite enough of that already; so don't be trying your coquettish tricks on me. That's not Moreton tactics. See Miss Constance, how cool she looks; she would not give a fig to hear, I'll warrant," he said, with a chuckle. "Yes," said Constance, steadying the little tremor that came into her voice; "I am quite as anxious as Edith; we all are." There was something in her face that checked Trevor's banter, and in a moment he said: "To see the way in which Moreton bears off all the regi- mental honors, is enough to make any officer in it tender his resignation. There is no dash, mind you-no enthusi- asm-never volunteers for extra service; but whenever he is ordered, out he goes, with an ugly sort of determination that bodes little good to the Blue-coats; such a man as-any   IN A CRUCIBLE.        131 officer has reason to be proud of; always at his post, cool in danger-asking no favors-demanding nothing as a right -deceiving all but those who know his confounded pride -only a private-rather shabby sometimes-covered with blood, dust, and gunpowder-a very unfit objett for lady- like enthusiasm, but with gentleman written in every line of his handsome face, and soldier in every curve of his scarred, stalwart frame. Aye, don't start, Miss Edith; - he's got some right ugly seams; Stonewall's men are likely to get such tributes when they do their duty. I wish this brother of yours had been at Balaklava; fine chance then to have seen him set his white teeth and wake that ugly devil in his blue eyes. Not but what he had his chance in the valley, and improved it, too. He bears his honors loftily, though; curse his coolness! I heard him compli- mented by old Stonewall himself, and not a flush showed itself on his sallow face-just a slight rising of that big vein in his forehead; and when the general rode off, and I clapped him on the back with my congratulations, he looked as if he'd like to knock me down for my impertinent famil- iarity. At first, the fellows couldn't bear him. He had a lazy way of curling the smoke from his cigar, or eating his dinner in the most comfortable attitudes, while the grape- shot were raining around thick as hail, and round-shot knocking over the caissons, that looked like bravado; but he had his chance, and then the men knew better. He's any amount of conceit, though it's not of the. offensive sort--" "Like mine," interrupted Edith; but Trevor was full of his theme now, and went on: "And I never knew any one with a better right to it. He showed too, one-day, that he had a heart, spite of his icy manner. We had a lot of boys just out of the hospital, and nothing would do but they must go in swimming. It   132        IN A CRUCIBLE. was an ugly stream, and in they tumbled head foremost. 'Twasn't long before there was a cry that Harry Wyverne had broken his neck. Moreton had been playing chess un- der a tree, very quietly, with one of the officers; but when that cry came, the chessboard went over with a bang, and he was at the river-bank in a few mdments. Poor Harry! He was the baby in the regiment; some widow's curly- headed darling, that had wound himself into all the tough hearts of the soldiers. His body was gone under for the second time, when that plunge of Moreton's startled us. He struck out boldly, using his left arm-a thousand anxious eyes following him,-as many lips praying that things were not so bad. But they were bad enough, we soon saw, when Moreton laid him on the bank; and there was no need of his piteous moans to tell us the truth. He had but a short time to live; and if the hands were rough, they were- very-tender, that stretched him on a cot, and bore him into the hospital, giving him over to the women, who had been crying and wringing their hands all the while, and who now raised noise enough to untaan the'stoutest of us. No one was thinking of Moreton, then; but he was standing in the midst of us, dripping wet; and we suddenly remembered that he had done all this with a disabled limb, while we had stood staring. Soldiers like bravery, but they like tenderness and good feeling too; and though they knew better than to cheer him then, there were any number of kindly glances cast on him as he went into his tent; and he owed much forbearance to his good deed that day. A soldier's life is made up of all sorts of strange things, Miss Edith; and while we are often too much taken up to notice the coolness with which a man walks up to face death at a cannon's mouth, we are sure to mind all the little camp incidents'that stamp him for life:.' As silence fell upon the group Arthiir glaneed at Parolet.   iNN A CRUCIBLE.        133 Not a muscle of her face had moved, not a tinge of color betrayed interest in the theme that had engrossed them; but as he looked at her, she turned her head with that swift motion peculiar to her, and returned his gaze with one which, full of meaning, she gave him no time then to inter- pret. She drew her wrappings around her, took her leave, and, linking her arm in her husband's, descended the stairs.   CITAPTER XIV. AN AUTUMN JOURNEY. "The race of life becomes a hopeless flight To those that walk in darkness. But there are wanderers o'er eternity Whose bark drives on, and on, and anchor ne'er shall be." Byt m. IN the dull gray of the early morning Arthur stood upon the platform, some twenty minutes too soon, awaiting the train. The weather was raw and windy; a'slight, driving mist coming noiselessly down, through which dark objects loomed, while the slow minutes dragged by. He is growing impatient; takes out his watch, compares it with the rail- road time, drops it -back into his pocket, and gazes down the little street, where market-carts begin -to rumble, and where stray gleams of dawn light up the pools of water. Out beyond is a bare stretch of country, dimly visible, with the road sweeping away in its interminable curve, and slow figures moving over the wet grass; with farm-houses, dull and quiet, and the wind blowing sharper every minute. Arthur draws his cloak closely around him, and paces the platform with a patient, monotonous tread, and with a dull feeling of pain creeping over him, at the thought that he is leaving home behind. It is wretched enough, without this miserable mist, creeping chilly into his clothing, and the raw wind driving in hi face. Other figures begin to crowd the platform, huddling about in groups; the guard goes out with a covered lantern, and sleepily begins to sort the baggage; and, watching him with that idle interest which 134   IN A CRUCIBLE,        135 all travellers feel, in lieu of more lively sensations, Arthur suddenly turns as a woman touches him on the arm. She is clothed in some dark material, heavily swathed in wrappings, and with her face covered with the thick folds of a veil. In some wonderment he surveys her, until the light breaks unpleasantly upon him with the sound of her voice. "Was this well done, Mr. Moreton? Can you think that I would have you burden yourself with such an errand? Was it kind in you to deceive me? I am never grateful under forced obligation." "This is no place--," began Arthur. "I had no other opportunity. When I tell you that I will not permit it, I have said sufficient. You shall not serve me, Mr. Moreton.; It was your opportunity last night, and you were cruelly doubting me. You would have left, believing me false-believing anything of me but the truth. I saw it in your fade; I have learned to study faces that are turned to mipe: can you wonder at it? I heard you' tell Constance that your mission was robbed of all but a dry sense of duty. I know not if a desire to relieve a fellow- creature of a sense of misery be a sin. Later on, you won- dered that I evinced no interest in that enthusiastic eulogy on your brother; read that, and say if I have not reason to doubt him," Her voice was harsh, and she had swept away the folds of her veil, disclosing a face quite colorless with passion, and with the raw chill of the morning. She held the paper to his eyes and Arthur took it mechanically. His hands shook like an aspen, and he vainly sought, for some moments, to make out the writing. He had been dumb under her sharp anger; had found no word to say: what could he say, and not tell her all the truth, that she had not even remotely guessed? He read it over and over, slowly-the few words   136        IN A CRUCIBLE. of Reginald's diagram. He could not condemn her for harshness here; but he was ,wishing that she had never shown him that scrap of paper. It was his own opinion of her; and he could not raise his eyes, while she stood there, reading him through and through. "Come under shelter," he said; " you will be wet quite through." She never heeded him; she was pulling away at her bon. net strings, the moisture trickling over her face, and running off her dress in little streams. ' We have but a few moments," urged Arthur; "and you must hear me. , Come!" " But a few moments!" she iterated, bitterly; "I have a whole life-a whole, long life! Oh, Mr.- Moreton, had you no mercy?" No; he had none to himself, or he had never resisted that cry I! He laid his hand on her arm; he forced her slowly under the dark arched roof,-out of sight of the watch- ful eyes, and out of hearing of the curious ears of the crowd. She looked at. him steadily: "Do not attempt to deceive me again, Mr. Moreton; do not say you never lost faith in me. My eyes are so keen! They are always looking for that expression on the faces around me. Your brother was a better actor; he only left this little evidence of his treach- ery, to steel my heart anew to all soft and kindly influences. Who believes in me? How shall I do right?" and she threw up her hands, covering her eyes, and leaning heavily against the arch. "Hush!" said Arthur, hoarsely; "I will not deceive you. I did think this of you; will you forgive me? Will you send me on this errand with your forgiveness, and bid me serve you? For the love of Heaven, say that you will   IN A CRUCIBLE.        137 forget what has passed. How should you understand- how--" He stopped suddenly, bewildered by the chaos of his ideas -the vehemence of his speech; and Parolet became calm, as the passion of another grew stronger than her own. Both started, as the shrill scream of the whistle rang through the arches, and in another moment the long train dashed around the bend, and thundered up to the platform. There was time but for a few words, in the hurry and bustle that ensued, A rush of passengers toward them roused Arthur to speech: "Speak, Parolet," he cried; but there was no answer, for in her bewilderment she scarcely heard him. He sprang on the platform. The guard cried, "All aboard!" and once more the train steamed on in the dark- ness; the sparks hissing out in the mist, and -the lone figure of Parolet's messager bending down in the gray light, with a long, fervent wrestling in spirit-thankful that there had been time for no more. He remembered her dreary words: "I have a whole life--a whole, long life!"A life-long, in which to believe him hard and cruel-a life-long; and the seal could never be taken from his lips! On and on sped the train; the huge engine panting and -laboring, while they dashed with lightning speed by sleep- ing farm-houses, with lazy cattle blinking sleepily out at them through the mist, and watch-dogs waking up with a sharp yelp; with the white veil rolling away in the valleys, and creeping up the hill-sides-the day wearing on, and no sun to pierce the heavy clouds-with a distracting hum of noisy voices around him--the sickening odor of tobacco- and the harsh grating of the wheels as they ring backward, and bring the train up with a lurch at the next station. Then Arthur lapses into quiet, after the rush, and watches them idly through his window, while they saunter into the   138        IN A CRUCIBLE. station-house, and come out with bits of ham and bread, and glasses of rum; back again, filling the close atmosphere with noxious odors; while they get under motion once more, and the rain pelts down pitilessly-every moment the wind growing keener. Who has not taken such a journey, once in a lifetime? with the wearisome monotony of natural objects driving the soul into madness-with head throbbing with pain, and nerves quivering with the discordant life around. And Arthur made his lonely pilgrimage, with heart crushed out and brain unnerved; going mechanically from station to station--remembering nothing but his pain, until the light of his life flickered back to its mission: back through fiery temptation, the holy light of prayer led his weary soul to its trust in God, once more! Parolet had stood riveted to the spot, powerless to arrest his sudden movement, and filled with sharp remorse that she had sent him off;without the forgiveness he craved; filled, too, with a vague wonderment, as she heard s once more, in imagination, the passionate utterance from lips so unused to pleading. Then, she moved slowly away from the noisy crowd that were gathered around her, stamping their cold feet, and shaking the moisture from their great- coats. She went slowly back through the streets to her home. The dull morning, was fully awake now; housemaids stood at the doors, mop in hand, and with round eyes, all alive to sound and sight; milk-carts rattled over the pave- ment, ragged urchins clambered over area railings; and market-women trudged by with laden baskets, and muttered imprecations on the weather. There was such a homely sense of reality in the familiar sights and sounds that met her, that Parolet wp dered at her own excitement of an hour back. She  s half-ashamed of her anger, of her /^   IN A CRUCIBLE.         139 soiled garments, of the dripping moisture that was running off on to the floor in little, dark pools. She had been half- mad to wander out of her house at such an hour-to stand with her uncovered face in the driving rain, a mark for the wonderment of the passer-by! What would Arthur think of her--what could any one think of her womanliness? Trevor was only on short furlough, to attend to some business at St. Philips; and Parolet, hastily changing her dress, awoke him, that he might make his preparations for departure. Well is it for us, that the mists of morning often dispel the fierce resolves that gather in the darkness of the night; i and that the quiet restraints of conventional life come timely to our aid, to ward off the threatenings of disgrace, hovering, oftener than we wot, over the unconscious slumberers in the family circle! Are men often moved to a change of pur- pose by such influence? I doubt it.. Parolet had gone forth on her luckless errand, with all her wrong impulses hurrying on a relentless purpose to stop this journey; to strangle all hope of even a stray gleam of light on the dark mystery of her life; to accept suspicion and distrust as her portion; to strive no more for good; to put away this life of deceit, that was clinging to her like a dark shadow shutting out the sunlight of existence I Would her husband miss her-would he find life a dreary thing, without the face that had smiled patiently and persistently upon him through eight weary years? - She believed that he loved her; she was truly grateful for his kindness; but her life was only a lie, after all--a lie, palpable to all but him! She held her cheek now penitently to his salute; for all her evil passions had died out. Her messager waA speeding on his errand of mercy; the light might yet come. There were no eyes upon her now; none who knew her secret. She would yield no more to passionate impulses.   "O        IN A CRUCIBLE. As we have said, she raised her cheek to her husband's salute, putting up her arm on his rough neck, and murmur- ing some words, which might have been of endearment, or penitence, they were so indistinct; and he bent down and kissed her, drawing her to him, and meeting her eyes quite fearlessly. How well she remembered that look, and that caress in after-years! Remembered it with proud womanly pain, long after the kind voice was forgotten and the kind deeds blotted out; for with that remembrance perished her faith in man. Her own trust had been unwavering: she had given him an unsullied honor, an unswerving faith; and he had smiled in her face, and betrayed! All this she remembered in her passionate scorn, meting out merciless disbelief to all men for his act.               ,2 'e . .   CIIAPTER XV. MR. FENWICK MAKES AN INVESTMENT WHCH PROMSES TO PAY INTEREST! "Dieu s'eet fait homme; soit. Le diable s'est fait femme I Elle m'a pris A an milieu du sermon. Mais belle I un profile d'ange, avec 'aeil d'un demon. Puis aux choses d'amour elle parait savante." Victor Hugo. ON Mr. Fenwick's return to St. Philips, he found the fol- lowing letter:       . "MY DEAR ALLAN:--  When you receive this, I shall be on my way to Europe. Will your friendship enable you to do me a service, while I can only place a portion of my confidence in you? Indeed, I may say the confidence of another, which I am not at liberty to divulge. The business on which I am engaged has reference to Mrs. Trevor;- and circumstances render it prudent that I should not commu- nicate directly with her. I am only providing for a possible contingency in asking you to let me write to you. Should I be compelled to do so, you will make Mrs. Trevor acquainted with the purport of the letters. I know you will think all this mystery unnecessary-probably, improper- when I say that Captain Trevor is unacquainted with my mission-nor do I wish him to be; but I can explain nothing at present, and have been in some doubt as to whether Reginald or yourself should be the recipient of this request. After writing a few lines to him, to that effect,-I suddenly "1   "2        IN A CRUCIBLE. destroyed them, and concluded, on the whole, I would trust to your friendly interest in my behalf. I write you this, as I wish you to know the truth; and you will not thereby infer that I am simply making use of you, or that I intend you to burn your fingers in any nefarious transaction. I am not inclined to courses of expediency; but in this instance there is, positively, no other to pursue. "Yours ever, ".ARTHUR MORETON,. This letter was hastily written, and mailed at the second station on the route. Allan surveyed its contents dubiously. He had no fancy for playing third party to any mystery; particularly where he was to be kept wholly in the dark, as in this instance' He did not like Mrs. Trevor, and this mystery served only to strengthen his disbelief in her; but he could refuse no request of Arthur's. Yet he was quite vexed at his abrupt departure, and muttered: "The dear boy is quite beside himself: getting me into' no end of scrapes: first, he turns his back on his congregation, and runs off to St. Bevins under a most odious imputation; then ends, by rushing off to Europe in the very teeth of the war, leaving me here to fight his battles out-and that woman at the bottom of it!" It will be seen that Mr. Fenwick was by no means amia- bly disposed; and his face settled into a heavy frown as he scratched his pen slowly across the paper, penning the following, after much deliberation: ( There can be no question, my dear fellow, of serving you in any way; but you could have done me no greater service in this matter, than in asking me to go it blind. Truth to tell, I do not fancy having anything to do with it. It strikes me, a man ought not to be kept in ignorance of any matter concerning his wife: however, I suppose I must   IN A CRUCIBLE.         148 trust your usual sagacity. What-could possess you to fly  off at such a tangent-not even waiting to say good-bye to the truest of chums? "A. FENWICK." Mr. Fenwick was highly pleased with his letter. He had shirked all :responsibility, eased his conscientious scruples by a delicate rebuke, and delivered his friend over to the powers of darkness, if his head failed him. "And I'll send her the letters unread," concluded Fenwick, wiping his pen, and leaning back in his chair. He was letting himself composedly down from his temporary fit of irritation into a much happier frame of mind. He suddenly recollected it was Saturday afternoon, and no sermon written. He rose, sauntered to the shelves, and took down a volume of Plato, laid open the vellum-covered case, extracted his sermon of last week, and tried the nib of his pen. He was in no hurry, and began leisurely making marginal notes. It was a pleasant afternoon, all sunshine and shadow, with a brisk feeling in the air, and through his closed window he could hear the faint clinking of tools in the shops below, and the cheery voices of the workmen as they plied their busy trade. He often paused in his lazy work to watch the pigeons cooing and fluttering about on the opposite roof-soft, white, pretty things, with arched necks, and bright, tender eyes. At length, he went at his work in earnest; first, with long pauses, and a careless hand --then, with pink flushes coming and going on his fair face, and eyes full of thought. Scratch, scratch, went the steady pen, and Fenwick was deeply absorbed in his work; too deeply to note the quiet, stealthy step on the threshold, and the little figure that stole noiselessly round to his shelves. She poised herself on the edge of a chair, looking back at him over her shoulder, and keeping her sly, bright eyes   "4    -    I A CRUCIBLE. fixed on his face. Just in the act of extracting a book, lr. Fenwick raised his head, and his eyes fell upon her. His face darkened suddenly, and if she had hoped to escape his wrath by her very pretty attitude, and the look of depre- cation she assumed, she had miscalculated both her own power and Mr. Fenwick's resolution. "Did I not forbid you to come here?"  he demanded sternly. She started violently as he spoke, her foot slipped, and catching vainly at the shelf, she came heavily to the floor. She was not hurt, but she determined to make the best of her accident. Mr. Fenwick saw the state of the case before he had taken two steps across the room to her relief, and he seized her roughly by the shoulder, exclaiming : "Don't let me- have to tell you again that you are not to come to my room. If you want books, ask me for them in Sunday class, and you shall have them." She was crying now in earnest; pale with fright, and the tears running over her piteous face, so childish in grief that Fenwick began to soften. He looked at her bright hair, its glittering masses all tangled and unkempt, but losing nothing of its beauty; at her white throat fluttering witli sobs; then, at her bare feet and legs, quite blue with' cold, and thought what a pitiable little object she was. She had never taken her eyes off his face, and saw that he was relenting. Suddenly, a look of low cunning came into them, but before she could open her red lips to frame the speech she intended, to her astonishment, the rector shook her violently by the shoulder, exclaiming: "Now you understand! You are never to darken this door again. Be off with you at once! None of your tricks, you little imp! I know you, and I won't have -you coming here. I shall tell Mrs. Burton not to open the door to you."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         145 He hurried her to the door, thrust her through it, and closed it behind her. Was Mr. Fenwick satisfied with his victory when won? I fear not! He had been terribly put out, had acted with unnecessary violence, unseemly in a clergyman, and was, even yet, only irritated, not penitent, at his share in it. What, had become of the little gi rl? Thrust out, she had stood for a moment quite stunned with surprise; then she turned, went quickly down the stairs, opened the street door, and looked up and down. There was no one in sight, and she went out, stood for a moment under Mr. Fenwick's window, and lifted her face; It was livid with passion, every feature quivering with it, the bright eyes fairly blinded as she raised them, and her white hands were tossed hastily up, while the lips writhed in a burst of childish frenzy. She was invoking-not blessings on the Rev. Mr. Fenwick's head; and only at the sound of footsteps ceased her pantomime, and turning ran swiftly down thb street, and disappeared. There was an end to Mr. Fenwick's sermon-writing for that afternoon, so he concluded to preach one instead; a very stern one, to judge by his face, as he took his hat from the table, and strode down, the stairs. There was a nervous impatience in his movements as he threaded the narrow, noisy street; and it is to be feared that he sniffed the crisp winter air with less than his wonted serene sense of enjoy- ment. He was, unmistakably, in a very ugly temper; and perhaps this was only too apparent to Mrs. Warner-when he raised the latch of her little gate. She knew him by sight, and her first impression of a speaking acquaintance was not destined to be a very favorable one. She was a low-browed, fair-haired woman, with a sullen beauty in her face, and I sloven" written unmistakably in 7 - ,  "          '   "6        IN A CRUCIBLE. every fold of her very untidy dress. It was poor encour- agement to Allan's speech, to be stared at in that fashion; but he began, with little hesitation: "Mrs. Warner, I have called to speak to you about your daughter." The woman looked at him, with a sharp, suspicious gleam in her dull eye, but vouchsafed no rejoinder. "She is uncommonly pretty," continued Allan, "is quite bright, seems fond of reading, and I fear spends more of her time at it than is quite good for her, unless it were properly directed. Do you look after her as much as you might?"  "I mind my own business; which it seems you don't," returned the woman shortly.' Allan's temper began to work, but he strove to speak calmly: "I feel it my duty as a clergyman to speak to you. You should keep that girl at home-and healthfully employed, as befits one inl her station. I have seen her hanging about the workshops, or running over the country, when she had much better be under your eyes These are times in which one must needs be careful; there will be troops stationed in the town; we may also have a visitation from the enemy. Her beauty is a dangerous gift, and her size is no safe- guard. You cannot be unmindful of the feelings of a mother; and I choose rather to think you have acted ignorantly." The woman's countenance had darkened during this speech with vindictive feeling, and now she broke out: "Ignorant! who's ignorant? Fitted to her station in life! What do you know of me, or mine? My Susan's pretty enough to play lady, if she has a mind to; and she shall. I know enough to manage my own affairs, and I'll do it.! want no meddlin' preachers here. Do you under- stan:d that? I've had enough of gentlemen and gentle- manly ways. Your road and mine lie far apart. I know   IN A CRUCIBLE.        14 7 my station; and they're not likely to come together un- less you forget yours." I' I have only advised you for Susan's good," said Allan quietly, "and said what your own good sense should have dictated." I "Let yours teach you to leave other folks' business alone," she retorted rudely. "'-What is it to you what Su- san does?" "ccMuch," said Allan, gravely, "though you may' not choose to understand it. I am using what influence my office gives me to control you. Of course I can do no more than advise, yet I can compel Susan to discontinue lher visits to my lodgings. It is not seemly in her, and will subject me to unpleasant remark, which, as a clergyman, I am bound to avoid." "Mr. Moreton never minded it," she said hastily. "No," said Allan, coloring slightly, "but iMr. Moreton and I are not quite the same.  Now, understand me thoroughly--I can no longer permit Susan's visits." The woman gave him a shrewd look; then broke into a low, taunting laugh: "Ah, it's yourself you're fearing! I thought so! I know something of gentlemen like you; and now let me tell you, once/or all,". she added, fiercely, " that you're not to darken my door again-mind that! And if you can't take care of yourself, don't come asking me to do it for you." She paused, breathless with her volubility, and with a coarse, red color coming up into her not uncomely face. He had come to preach, but their positions seemed rather reversed, She had delivered her thrusts with uncommon gusto, and with a very irreverent disregard of the sanfctity of his cloth. : Heqfhund he must content himself with having discharged his duty, getting reviling for his pains, and said calmly!  evnsY   "8  -      IN A CRUCIBLE. "Very well, Mrs. Warner, I have done my duty. If you let that little thing run about the streets, she will come to harm. Good-evening!" He lifted his hat from his brow with that high-bred ease ever the envy of the vulgar, and departed. "And if she does, it will be at the hand of some fine gen- tleman like yourself. Honest poor folks respect one another, and my girl need only fear the hawks." And retreating into the house, she slammed the door violently.   CHAPTER XVI. IN WHCH REGINALD S DIAGRAM LOSES ITS PERSONALITY, AND BECOMES ENLARGED. "There are not a few instances of that conflict, known ialso to the Fathers, of the spirit with the flesh, the inner with the outer man, of the freedom of will with the necessity of nature, the pleasure of the individual with the conventions of society, of the emergency of the case with the despotism of the rule. "It is this, which, while it makes the interest of life, makes the difficulty of liv- ing. It is a struggle, indeed, between unequal powers-between the man who is a conscious moral person, and nature, or events, or bodies of men, which either want personality or unity; hence the man, after fearful and desolating war, some- times rises on the ruins of all the necessities of nature, and all the prescriptions of society. "The spirit of man, an agent indeed of curious power and boundless resource, but trembling with sensibilities, tender and irritable, goes out against the inex. orable conditions of destiny, the lifeless forces of nature, or the ferocious cruelty of the multitude; and long before the hands are weary, or the invention exhausted, the heart may be broken in the warfare 1 "Dichthung und Wahrheit."                 Goethe. THE   war -dragged on   its weary   length  of years, and the  Spring  of 1864  dawned .upon us, leaving     few  think- ing minds amoncg the     army  who  did not realize that the issue was hopeless. Not alone to the leaders of our cause, to those who had, risked name and fame, was this dreary fact a palpable truth, but to the ranks, where hand to hand the men of the South battled for their rights--the light broke.   Here' chivalrous  birth staked  only  a life against lost honor, and   won-a   nameless grave!    Day after day, when the mist of Hope rolled away, and the grim manes of War frowned unappeased over its holocaust of human vic- tirns, the proud- ranks of the    Southern armies marched on's ward to   death  cheerfully, that  national honor  might live, And it shall! Through the wide nations of the world, "9   150        IN A CRUCIBLE. the ranks of our armies have given to history an unsullied escutcheon, whereon are blazoned bravery, honor, truth, and chivalrous loyalty to the cause they served! To Reginald, as to thousands of others, the bitter truth had long been apparent: it is needless to say that he, like them, sickened under it. His whole life, his dreams of am- bition and distinction died here! There was, too, a deeper, holier feeling that had struggled to life under the stern tests of war--its death throes-the tears of widowed women, the cry of the orphan, the aimless life of the maimed soldier, its cheerful privation, its glowing heroism; must that, too, perish? Perish:! when with it sprang to warmth and life the germ of all that was noblest in the nature of our men! Nay; out of-the dark record of that four years' war, gleams a fair page whereon we see the record of myriads, with natures struggling manfully to the light, amid the dis- appointment of their brightest hopes, with lives whose wi- dened current of thought and feeling bear out our faith in man; whose Christian fortitude in the gloom of disaster and defeat, reckon them among the great oiles of earth, though its pomps and glories are denied them. We have said that Reginald was devoid of military am- bition; yet there was an innate force in the man which had prevented his sinking into commonplace, even here. With the ease that had attended- his efforts through life, he had stretched-forth his hand and plucked the fruit that hung temptingly within reach. Military promotion .is not often won by simple merit; and Reginald had, from the first, re- fused to claim rank upon any other ground. It was a weary time, with its dull monotony of camp life, where the mind sickened for its stimulus; and he wel- comed the hours of battle, when its dangers were forgotten amid the excitement that a strong nature craves. When the aim of his life was struck back by this sharp truth, he   IN A CRUCIBLE.         151 , pursued his way with little change of purpose to do his duty where he was called, to strike hard, when he struck at all, and to smother his pride and his conscious power, that he might swell the number of gallant men who elevated their rank to a position never held before, with a sturdy deter- mination to fight until the last, and then-to go quietly home, with all the high hopes of manhood crushed out, with the future a dreary blank before him, and bear his pain and mortification as thousands of others would. With such thoughts, and such aims, it was not likely that the events of his soldier life, if unsought and undesired, found him wanting. There was, as Trevor had said, no dash-no enthusiasm- only a cool determined courage that brought men to a belief in him, and justified even the strong self-confidence which, to himself, he scrupled not to avow. He was perfectly aware that he could have commanded rank, and that his abilities would have sustained him in a much higher station than that of the men under whom he served; yet his perfect indifference had preserved his secret, and few unacquainted with the tenor of his life would have guessed that the per- fectly respectful, obedient soldier, held himself far above the station to which it could hardly be said he had descended. It was difficult to find fault with an egotism so rigidly guarded, with a pride so jealously veiled in chivalrous courtesy that you seemed only impressed with your own inferiority. He was not a man to turn lightly from the purposes of a life; nor were its blanks to be filled with the more trivial occupations which serve to blunt the edge of disappointment. No outward bitterness betrayed this senti- ment, but it gave point to his aim and force to his blow, when he remembered that upon the strength of his right arm he had staked the purposes of a whole life-and lost! He had no friend in the army save Trevor, and sometimes,   1,52        IN A CRUICIBLT. as he sat idly in his tent, he was led to think of Trevorl's wife. It was hardly possible that she should have 'passed quite out of his mind, for he had connected her with his favorite study, making the test of her character its proof, as it'were; hardly possible either, with her name ever on her husband's lips. His coarse pride in her, his rough fondness for the woman who had reflected so much credit on him, brought her unceasingly before Reginald, and led him to a remembrance of her singular fascination. Instinct- ively that remembrance called to his mind some lines penned of Margaret Ossoli: "A face that fascinated with- out satisfying. Never seen in repose, never allowing a steady perusal of expression, it baffled every attempt to judge character by physiognomical induction. Yon saw the evidence of a mighty force, but what direction that force would assume-whether it would determine itself to social triumphs, or to triumphs of art-it was impossible to divine. Her moral tendencies, her sentiments, her true and prevail- ing character did not appear in the lines of her face. She seemed equal to anything, but might not choose to put forth her strength. You felt that a greatpossibilitylay behind that brow; but you felt also, that the talent that was in hermight miscarry through indifference or caprice." It was a face so full of contradictions-so passionate, so keenly intellectual, that it baffled you, as its varied charac- teristics defied your scrutiny! He puzzled-himself some- times, with wondering whether he should ever see more of her; whether event would be likely to favor him, if he did? He did not believe that circumstance makes either the man or the woman. It is the responsible thinke with moral or immoral bias, that controls circumstance. What, then, would event be likely to do for her, or for his theory? 'She was one, who, to his belief, united a high order of gifts to great personal attractions; a woman of thought, of   IN A CRUCIBLE.         153 impassioned nature, who had teen forced into a condition of life the most narrowing; yet she had been little affected thereby. What counteracting principle had been at work? He knew there had been women of this description who had flung off the crushing influence; yet at the price of all gentler attractions. He had seen no such evidence in her. Then he reduced his theory somewhat after the following form. There was strong natural influence on one side,-of what nature, he could not yet determine; certainly, with nothing of either negative or positive goodness apparent, --therefore, most likely, evil! Circumstances- had so far aided these natural tendencies-or would, unless counter- balanced by some strong opposing force. She bad not loved her husband, he felt sure; she had no children; there had been few domestic influences at work; her married life had been spent mostly abroad, and her early years without cul- ture. On the other hand, a strong intellect had developed itself, late in life. Had its weight been thrown for or against evil influences? He had a faint belief that intellect is only a stimulus to evil nature, and that when there are strong moral tenden- cies, they have it only to combat. As evidence in support of his belief, he would have cited Catherine de Medici, or her namesake of Russia; dwelling upon the revolting cruel- ties of both, the absence of all moral rectitude, and the strong overbalance of intellect. There were many others, as prominent instances; many, too, in the daily life around he was not disposed, on the other hand, to- any arbitrary assertion that intellect was always depressed by the play of the moral faculties; only that it was a stimulus to evil, and oftener a snare than an incentive to good. He had been startled, too, by the extraordinary change in the character of this woman's head and face, in the space of a few years  7*   154        IN A CRUTCIBLE. a change hardly to be imputed to the development of m/ndl, when there was such corresponding evidence of the growth of natural qualities. Here he had grown puzzled, until, struck with the perfect harmony of personal development, he had settled to a belief in the doctrine of Aristoxenus-a system of perfect harmonies! Here he Was furnished at once with a solution; the, only remaining puzzle being to settle the point, as to what those natural tendencies were. If moral, and acting in sympathy with the other principles, she furnished an example of a rare perfection of endowments; if immoral, a type of that exceptional woman-nature of which History furnishes us with some startling examples, and which, doubtless, are common enough in daily life, but which circumstances have compressed into narrow arti- ficial limits of conventionalism, and-virtue! he was growinginto a restless desire to test her in some way-in any way--mercilessly, so that he but gained some bejer :etitsit into this enigmatical character ;in which he w^kifcoming intensely interested.

Parolet had never been subjugated by the softening, refining influence of that   passion which subjects woman to the strong controlling power of man that appeals to his tenderness and his sympathy. With strong pride in his own intellect, Reginald held this to be no essential in a woman. His pride of mind had never led him into error, had never made him skeptical If he questioned his Scriptural faith, the bias of intellect had rather strengthened his belief. Was this the effect of strength of mind applied to truth, or was it not as likely some innate reverence of character? Intelligence, after all, was not needful to strong religious feeling. He remem- bered hearing an ignorant woman once relate the change in her life, in an allegory as beautiful, as well-sustained in language and purport, as if penned by the best rhetorician of the age,-an allegory in which the distinction between moral and religious duty had been clearly demonstrated; yet this woman was perfectly uneducated, had never shown much natural aptitude, and had never listened to sermons except from the lips of the most illiterate sect preaher! If intellect unsupported did little for man, it did much less for woman. She could receive no elevation without spirit- ual and moral growth; yet if to these was united a high order of mind, the distinction of sex was removed. An unwomanly woman could never be attractive to him  by simple endowment of intellect. It seemed   a singular inconsistency in the man, that, with his haughty self- consciousness reared upon this basis, he was yet inclined to reject its influ nce upon his moral nature. Remove the stronger power, and he would still have claimed his moral rectitude. If his surmise was correct as to the nature of her organic tendencies, it was also not unlikely that it was tout consciousness. This seemed a strong conservative principle in man y evil natures- ignorance of th extent of onesal. cabpiZty to do eiil. If unconscious, was there esponsibility? If the revelation came, responsibility would   156        IN A CRUCIBLE. follow. Would she stand such a test? This was the sum of his questioning. When he spoke of a test, it was worthy of remark that he had no thought of the ordinary temptations of a woman's life-evil to be compassed through weakness or ignorance! It was a strong nature, which could not remain in ignorance of its powers; it was exceptional, and if unable to fix in his mind the precise nature of controlling evil, he did not connect it with any idea- of womanly frailty. You will see that, with such a train of-reasoning working itself out in his mind, it was hardly possible, if she ever came under his observation, he could fail to be merci- lessly critical. In Cassandra, are we not firnished with a mythical type of weak woman-nature,--alive to error-look- ing into depths of probable sin, yet powerless to act--the prophetic power running by intuition beyond the weak, materialistic influence, yet stopping just short of material strength? This woman was no Cassandra: there were strong animal forces to sustain the vigor of intellectual and moral power; and in her, prescience, if it existed at all, was in the form of a gift-a responsible gift! Reginald was no materialist. He had a high belief in the spirituality of woman's nature,-a spiritual elevation not trampled down by sin, as a man's was. He knew that the Source whence she drew it had not denied it to her, even after the commission of sin: that there were many women whom social degradation had not made evil; who, removed from the strength of conventional barriers, had yet sought after better things as naturally as plants turn to the light. With man, sin is without detriment only so long as it is secret; once placed under the ban of society, he no longer' seeks to elevate himself; his power of will fails him: with spiritual nature he is but slenderly endowed; and his intelligence then becomes'but a useless burden. Deprive a woman of that spiritual elevation, and in his eyes she was   IN A CRUCIBLE.        157 no longer a marvel which his manhood could not com- prehend -a veiled Isis-but a materialistic creature, to be studied, read, and judged by such laws as his nature sanctioned and approved. Intelligence, in his estimation, could only be perfected in man or woman, when the moral and spiritual gifts, though subservient, acted in harmony with it; yet, though in woman it was not one of the essentials, he was by no means inclined to deny her the full benefit of her gift, when used in its highest perfection by her as by man. He was critical as to its manifestation in her, because he believed that " everything, however slight, grows from the essential life of the being." In common with the other Moretons, he possessed strong sensual passions; but their possession was not incompatible with purity of mind. He- had been restrained by an innate purity and by pride from debasing vice, and though he recognized the epithumetic nature of the woman, strongly perceptible in the physique, he did not thereby infer moral impurity of, thought. So far, he was enabled to judge sympathetically, and our charities are ever in proportion to our sympathies. We are ever prone to condemn what we cannot comprehend! It has been the error of man, in his study of woman, to underrate her force of character, by denying her her full share of the passions which she shares alike with him. In her, sensuality is robbed of its gross- ness, because the strong current of the affections flows undivided with it; yet, when arbitrary restraints sever them, she conquers by the spiritual power, which is one of the essential elements of true womanhood. Has man been less endowed, and how much' does he owe to custom? How much less does woman owe to her physical organization than man, if " only in a strong, clean body the soul can do its work fitly." Nature worked against her--society for her! Which is the most powerful? Nature aided man, -  .                 f . f!'   158        IN A CRUCIBLE. society licensed him! The strength lay all with the man, the feebleness with the woman. Was not this particularly true, if he denied her claims to a strengthening intelligence equal to his own? How then judge her, mercilessly and contemptuously! Woman is not the antithesis of man; she is part and parcel of himself-of his own nature: with her strength lying in spirituality-his, in materialism. He was more just to women than are men in general. In relation to Parolet, he felt that the prodigality of-nature had been, in some way, perverted; that the wholesome aim of her existence had been rudely turned aside ; and while he questioned the manner, he was not without a strong interest and sympathy for this woman, with her eye of fire, her fetter-bound soul, and her large idealities smothered in commonplace. It was a contortion to which nature was not likely to submit, and irruption seemed inevitable. He would have pitied her, had science proved correct: he felt strangely impatient of her while she balked his scrutiny. Time and event came to his aid in due course, and if the proof came too late for him, it justifies our interest in his speculations, that it came at all.   CHAPTER XVII. IN WHCH ARTHUR     PREACHES HS FIRST UNORTHODOX SER- MON TO A WILLING LISTENER---AND WHAT CAME OF IT.

"THE contingency has not arrived, my dear Allan, for which I claimed your patient attention; yet I am writing to you, I know not why, save that the dreary months since I left you have lapsed by, and left me with that strong craving for friendly communion which      assails the traveller in a strange land; perhaps, too, because it has been a season of sore trial to me, and your face haunts me as one that has settled toward the light. 159   160        IN A CRUCIBLE. "Do you remember telling me of your visit to the Neapolitan gallery, and of the incident connected with it? Do you remember, also, your having identified that woman subsequently with Mrs. Trevor? Do not imagine that in recalling these facts I am at all associating them with the object of my residence here: I am rather connecting them with a sort of moral obliquity which has fallen upon me, and under which I feel that the light of religion has failed me, as speech did Zacharias. I have been to the Neapoli- tan gallery,-I studied the picture--I seemed to see it in a light in which previously I had never beheld it. I was looking through it into the nature of a human being. I was constituting myself her judge--as I believe it becomes the part of a minister to be to those who come under his spirit- ual direction. He is responsible, if he misjudges-he is doubly so, if he closes his eyes to this duity. I knew Mrs. Trevor in her girlhood. When I say this, understand that I knew her as my seven-and-twenty years of .manhood was likely to know her seventeen years of womanhood. Not as I must know her now, or 'as I must know any fellow- creature so placed. In my calling we must administer to the spiritual needs of the creature; how far then are we bound to study the creature itself? What is the connection between the physical being and the spiritual nature, and what the line of demarkation, supposing that their component parts do not mingle? How far can general rules be applied to individual cases, and where ends our direct responsibility? These are somewhat the form of questionings as far as language-always inadequate-can frame them. Putting aside my character of clergyman, how far could my manhood comprehend her womanhood? If you and I, with the common tie of sex--with only its varying modifications-look upon things in such a totally different light, how draw any parallel between my moral or   IN A CRUCIBLE.         161 spiritual responsibility, and that of a being totally unlike in physical, mental, and organic structure? "I begin with my own phase of existence. You will see at once why I ignore lying, stealing, or even the more exceptional list of crimes; because by birth, blood, and education, I am barred from their influence. I select then that' form of sin which my birth does not exempt, and which by blood has been entailed upon me, as a family inheritance. I select sensual passion, too, as the crime through which sin originally came to us; the other sins being only the concomitant evils which followed this head and front of man's offending. Since my boyhood I have led an isolated life; one in which original thought has been aided by the lever of other men's ideas-in which moral rectitude has been assisted by religious education, and intercourse with the refinements of social life. These were to combat the natural proclivities. In how far would they enable a conquest? I determined to try. "I began by selecting the ministry; first, because strong religious feeling made me realize it as the perfection of human labor; second, because its restraints, if assumed at all, must, to my eyes, become arbitrary. Would both these sentiments enable me to combat natural inclinations? I became wholly engrossed'with this idea. If the spiritual grace triumphed over the brute passions of a nature so essentially epithumetic as mine, to what extent would it cover the responsibility of all men? I was soon convinced that nothing but spiritual grace would preserve me. I trusted wholly in prayer: if I acted contrary to its direct manifestation, it was because my blind materialism refused sympathy to the source of spiritual light. I know not how much of this is owing to the fact that society places no restraint upon the passions of men: certainly women are better guarded; or is it that their spiritual insight is keener   162        IN A CRUCIBLE. and stronger? Had I thought of women at all, I should probably have judged them as men are apt to judge; but at that time, the duty of making their natures a study had not been made apparent to me. I had no sympathy with their spiritual refinement; my own strength has ever been attained through strong wrestlings. "A case has suddenly been presented to me, in which I am called upon to question how far moral responsibility reaches, in a nature which has been engrafted with the taint of inherited sin through generations; one whose undevia- ting sameness evidences one of the most startling features of this nature ever presented to the study of the Physiolo- gist, I was about to say, but Theologian strikes me as the better word. Am  I justified in simply referring this burdened soul to spiritual strength, when I remain in igno- rance how far it is capable of receiving spirituality as a gift? How far am I justified in seeking to penetrate into this nature, using what means are in my power, that I may apply to its cure the requisite need? It was possible, that in studying the effect produced upon this woman by the picture to which you allude, I bmight be enabled to trace the secret sympathies which had moved her. Would not this form a clue? I am, even now, hesitating whether to reveal to you the chaos of thought into which I fell, studying that strange face in the portrait. Suffice it to say, that one con- viction forced itself strongly upon me. Only some secret affinity could have produced such an effect as you describe! The nature, then, was evil! Was it so in its plenitude of power, or had Nature, in preserving her secret from the gaze of others, also kept her victim in ignorance? This ignorance was part of the original state of innocence. The germ of evil was fruitless until knowledge gave it power. What would be the sustaining power if that mist of ignorance was suddenly dispelled? Had the powerful action of that   IN A CRUCIBLE.        163 secret sympathy to the portrait been any revelation? I could only argue, that, if the moral qualities were sup- pressed, spiritual nature must also be wanting; yet what connection really exists between the two? The Scripture distinctly classifies them. We are told that "for a righteous man, one would scarcely die; yet, peradventure, for a good man one would even dare to die." Is the simply moral man one who claims our highest sympathy and care, --the righteous requiring nothing beyond his spirituality, ,which fits him for either life? "This woman might have a susceptibility to spiritual impressions separate from that defective moral being. If so, -the issue could not be doubtful, if she could be led to see and accept the distinction. I lost my strength of vision. I became ignorant how much or how little all this had to do with revealed religion; how much my religion (for there are as many varieties as there are natures) had to do with that of others. Do you not see, therefore, that unless I am brought back to the light, I must preach no longer? Do not condemn me as visionary. These are matters in which we must not be governed by opinion. I am minded to serve God in singleness of heart, and my ministration must be pure. Ignorance in me would be sin! If His truths are not to be made apparent to me, then to whom?" Fenwick had determined, as we have seen, to submit Arthur's correspondence, unopened, to Mrs. Trevor; but his friendly interest or his curiosity mastered his resolve. He read and reread the letter, shrugged his shoulders, and concluded he owed it to "poor Arthur" to try and make out what all this whirl of language meant. Was he to recognize, first, the-possibility of a being deprived of any moral sense, yet not destitute of spiritual impressions?-one who recognized in the former only self-imposed laws of expediency?  with all the instincts of the animal, yet with   164         IN A CRUCIBLE. a soul capable of receiving the gifts of grace? What a sad picture such an image presented! What a woful Cassan. dra! Conscious of her moral deficiency, filled with mind and soul, incapable of averting her doom! A picture from which Fenwick revolted. He had no materialistic tenden. cies. His innate gifts were purity and spirituality; yet, Reader, if you deem it impossible that such a nature should fall into unequivocal sin, read no further., If you believe that man's fall came through the coarse materialism of his nature-that the subtle spirit addressed itself to none of that finer essence of his manhood--close the page; but remember, first, that we are dealing in truths, not sophisms: that man daily, hourly sins-! Shall we ignore, therefore, all faith in his higher attributes? Shall we not rather see that the specious form veils itself discreetly, that it may attack with force in an unguarded hour? The materialist has his warning in every pulsation that brings him into dangerous sympathy with vice i but there is no warning for him who revels in the higher gifts of esthetic enthusiasm. He sus- pects no evil, he sees no snare that might not be presented to his sense daily, in the bounteous, pure gifts of nature. He yields himself first unconsciously to soft influences, as he yields his spirit to fresh air and sunshine. Allan had repented his harshness to Susan Warner; he had grown to a belief in her well-simulated gentleness, ant' yielded himself involuntarily to the influence of her pretty, seductive ways. Again, as of old, the woman tempted, and the man fell! The woman, with her innocent, childish aspect-with her heart full of guile-of malicious, gleeful delight at her gratified revenge. He had never been again offended in his severe good taste by any exhibition of evil passion; the little face, full of sorrowful penitence, had looked meekly at him, until he learned to compassionate, then to permit a renewal of her visits to his book-shelves, ti   IN A CRUCIBLE.         165 his absence, he stipulated--finally, to watch for her in his favorite haunts-and then! The slender fingers learned to toy with the glittering mesh of her golden aureole, the head nestled to his arm, and her delicate beauty, with its simple,-natural graces, thrilled upon his senses like the toning of some delicious picture. He sinned, first, through his keen, spiritual perception: to hesitate, to falter, was to fall-the passions of man, once pampered and fostered, know no barriers of religion or honor: "Love took up the glass of time and turned it in his glowing hands- Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands." In delicious Spring, with dew and fragrance around him, the sweet idyl began and ended! Swift as the ban of sin, remorse had followed! remorse the keenest, that to him, who had given the warning, had been reserved the deed and its punishment. She never seemed to feel his desertion: merry Allan and penitent Allan were two very different per- sons; and when he ceased to amuse, she ceased to care for him, or at least ceased to affect what she had never felt. There were long days and weary months when his soul sickened, when he ascended his pulpit-stairs with the glow of shame on his cheek, with the passionate utterance of God's truth polluting his lips-no longer undefiled! When he went out into the open country, with the sunlight about him-looking out over the darkening river with the shadows lying athwart it, and lifted his pale face, mute and defiant, sullen with despair! Long days, when he strove to believe that that dim figma of unconscious sin, was to bear him blameless; to believe that but for that mist of delusion in another, thrust upon him inr an: hour of dangerous tempta- tion, he had passed unscathed. Then came an after-time, when he thought thus no longer; when he ceased to blame another, even Her, for his sin. When the sweet nature grew   166        IN A CRUCIBLE. to a deep, manly sense of penitence; when he resolved that, come what might, he would shoulder the scorn of al  men, walking no longer in deceit. The trustful soul found its comfort in the loving mercy of the Father. He only wanted time: time to grow strong; to do what was really wisest -and best. He went about, ministering to the sick, but shunning the face of all men, where he could; looking his sin manfully in the face, and trying to draw nearer to God, that he should not mind the frown of man. It was a bitter burden; one that blanched the cheek, and dimmed the lustre of the eye! His fine, sensitive nature quivered under the prospective lash of censure. He failed to remember One on whom the brutal faces of the Jewish mob had leered in His mortal agony, until the sight had grown dim to mortal things! He had written to Arthur: "'You are indeed laboring in the mists of a fearful delusion! As you value your own peace and that of others, cease your ministration, unless you can return to the faith you learned with your first prayer at your mother's knee. The study of the Physiologist and the Theologian have nothing in common with each other, nor has the former with revealed religion. In God's name, cease such inquiries!" Arthur had simply wondered at Allan's vehemence, and folded the letter away in apathetic indifference. He was not to be roused from self-delusion. The clear eye of faith was dimmed. Its vision was to be cleared, but not yet. Meantime, events have not paused while we have slowly ravelled the thread of narrative. The war was passing into rapid event, disastrous to the Southern arms, and discour- aging to the people'at large.' It was full six months from the date of Arthur's departure before the long-expected letter arrived, to be delivered to Mrs. Trevor, and it was post. marked Loci.   CHAPTER XVII. VOX DEI. "Sorrow grazes them; I know not what zephyrs breathe upon their wounds and dry them at once; why do mine bleed eternally? Why is it that the first sorrow of my life, instead of vanishing in the night of oblivion, is always before my eyes, terrible and living as the prolific blood of the hydra? For all mankind misfortune is a funereal hymn which passes, and whose notes melt away, little by little, in the distance: when the last takes its flight, the ear preserves not their sound. Why do they echo forever around me? Why this eternal death-chant which rises every hour in my soul, and forces me to weep continually? Why is my forehead bound with thorns that pierce it at every breath of wind, that dis. ports itself among the flowers with which others crown themselves?" George Sand. MARBLE and   canvas are eloquent, though   mute; and  the great master leaves upoin his work the impress      of soul/ Parrhasius, dipping his pencil in immortal dyes, has painted the  dying moan  upon  the lips of vanquished'mortality. We remember only results ;, the exultant art of the painter lives, a monument to man's genius; the eloquence of that dying agony vibrates in memory with the flush of triumph- ant power; the pulse thrills in sympathy with that despair- ing outcry--"   Gods!   that I could  but  paint a dying groan!"Yet here the eye    of genius failed;  failed to see that the lip is not mute-that the echo of that stifled moan peals still through those quivering lips, though ages have fled since it rang out defiantly under the impotent will of frail humanity!  Who  lifts the veil? Who sees the vision of besotted. manhood, drunk with power, revelling in the pangs of a fellow-creature? Who remembers that ere the immortality on that marvellous face was won, the vulture -rent his vitals--the iron sank deep in flesh and spirit? Ah I here the soul revolts.  And the power of Nature, no   less 167   168        IN A CRUCIBLE. than of Art, wins its triumphs in results. The work of the soul leaves its impress on the human face no less surely, than does the creative faculty in the artist result in stamp- ing its own ideality upon the marble or canvas. The power is not in the work of the chisel, though it render per. fection of lineament; nor is the human face perfected, unless the soul has wrought its work line by line with the strokes of Time and Event! Making humanity our study, shall we only realize results? The life that has been tried and tested-the life that has triumphed, commands our admiration. We cry, "The hand that made it is Divine!" Do we remember how    immortality has been won? Do we lift the veil and see the struggles through which nature reclaims her great work, that our admiration be * greater? Nay; we shrink here from the homely details of truth-robbing the fellow-creature alike with the artist of his high meed, that out of dull clay he has wrought a perfect work that shall never die! Reader, have you ever, among the faces around you, singled out one with volumes of unexpressed thought on the brow; with a world of earnest purpose in the eye? Faces, that in the deep play of passionate, unexpressed eloquence, brought to your mind thoughts of an unwritten oratorio, full of grandeur and pathos;-of an unspoken poem, at which your fancy but dimly snatches-a poem with something on it of that grand Homeric epic into which you look through possible years of woe and sorrow only to the fair face of the woman I seeing only that, and shutting your senses to all beyond?-faces that are stamped with the grandeur of lineament, the repose of thought that we instinctively connect with the earnest purposes of life: looking into which, the eye would grow- troubled and saddened, though its uncut leaves remained a mystery; upon which we/gaze, feeling that it masks a nature that   IN A CRUCIBLE.         169 will win its triumphs hardly-battling with life, as a strong  swimmer with the waves I And we feel this through no revelation of self. The play of unspoken thought dies on the lip, and looking into the eyes we see that,they have learned to look over a dim vista to the light beyond; that the surging of bitter waters rolls upon an unconscious ear. That it is a face that at life's close will still be turned away from the scrutinizing, pitiless eye of man, out to the light of Nature and of God; that the listening ears have been all these years hearkening to the Vox Dei. It may baffle you at its close, as it does now. Is it but an effort of creative genius-a work of human art perfected? Such a face was Parolet Trevor's, and while Constance gazed into it the lines of Shakspeare came into her mind : "There's nothing ill can dwell in rulch a temple': If the ill spirit have so fair an house, Good things will strive to dwell with it." It bore to-day an earnest  revelation of truth, and chained her with the powerful sense of a beauty that lies in a total freedpm from conventional disguise. The face was enshrined in a network of leaves and vines in a hill-side nook at St. Bevins, with the mellow sunlight trickling down through the leaves, and a soft shimmer of light wavering over it; with the heavy waves of her glossy hair catching the shadows, and rippling out into burnished threads as the branches parted overhead; with a wistful seriousness in the eyes, and the flutter of red lips apart, and full of witching softness. Looking upon the sinuous form that lay at lazy length in the shadow of the overhang- ing'branches, Constance was struck by its wonderful har- mony with the peculiar type of the face.   There was a muscular sense of power that we   see portrayed in the, figures of the  Jewish women of the   olden time. The flexible curves of the full, rounded limbs, betrayed the race 8   170        IN A CRUCIBLE. that had earned physical perfection by physical labor-  free graces of motion, and a full development, softened by refinement and delicacy; and where generations of intel. lectual culture have only tempered, not removed the free, powerful chiselling of Nature. In the arm of Rebekah at the well, we see the fine development of muscle which toil produces; yet in its rounded delicacy are not shocked by any incongruity to the portraiture of the gentle Jewish maiden. We blend no idea of coarseness with the physical perfection of this pastoral race. Nor in Parolet was this muscular beauty at variance with the idea of perfect refinement of mind and person. As Constance paused in front of her, she rose with that sudden, elastic movement which betokened habitual use of her physical powers, and the long train of her dark- riding-dress fell in sweeping folds about her. "Pray do not leave," said Constance; "you are enjoy- ing the evening. I came out for the same purpose: will you not bear me company?" "One scarcely needs other company than this," said -Parolet, rapidly sweeping the scene with her eye. Hardly; only enjoyment seems robbed of half its pleasure by solitude." "Do you think so?" said Parolet, softly. "I often come here to watch the light die on these hills. It is all so beautiful! Do you ever think how many kinds of light there are, and of the different thoughts they induce?" "No," said Constance, settling herself down on the grass; "but I should like you to tell me what you think about it." "We will begin artificially then, as there is less to be said; there is fire-light-which do you like best, wood or coal"?" "Oh, I greatly prefer wood-fires; and we always insist i1    IN A CRUCIBLE.        171 on a yule-log at Christmas, though mamma would prefer her luxurious grate in the drawing-room. Arthur was positive on the point of retaining the huge chimney-piece in the hall for the observance of this time-honored custom, --one may lay aside style and fashion at Christmas,-you know; and even Chester yielded the point at last." Her face had softened, thinking of the homely, bronzed one by the Christmas hearth-away now, beyond seas. "But you have not said which you liked best," she said, interrupting herself. "I like coal best," said Parolet; " wood-fires are so spite- ful-ordinary ones, I mean. I have no objection to yule-logs; though we hardly know in this country what a yule-log is. "Merry England" is the country for a genuine Christmas, -well snowed up outside, and a conflagration before which you might roast an ox whole, to say nothing of genuine merry-makings under mistletoe and holly. We come near to it when our Southern homes open their kindly hospitable doors for a month's gayety ; and we are privileged, then at least, to forget our cares, even though we must shoulder them on the first day of the new year. Revenons d nos  moutons: wood-fires seem such things of spite--they sparkle and snap so, one can never settle to thought. It seems to know this, and shoots out its flame-tongues with a noisy crackling that seems to say, admire me, think of me, and let thought alone. I love coal-fires and grates. The slow dropping of the cinders, the dull, red glow, the faint, fan- tastic structures that pass in slow, panoramic array, and sink silently, and with a faint stir cheating the eye of its illusions I! These give one time to dream and think; and  i what luxuries are thoughts and dreams! Both hold the  better half of life to me. I love light. I sit in the fire-light 1 and fancy shapes itself as fantastically as the most weird. imagination could conjure, and seems not out of keeping.   i ,  ?   72         - I IN. A CRUCIBLE. Morning-lightl sparkling and animated, makes one joyous; desiring to use the life that is flashing out so exuberantly all around. Lamp-light is clear and steady, like a good man's eye; it conjures up thoughts of great results-of night- watches given to thought that produces, not reflects: one only reflects in the fire-light, but grows sagely studious under the midnight oil. Evening-light! serene, holy, making sad the heart with a sense of its own imperfections- waking the blind soul to a perfect understanding of what the night will be that cometh after the light. Ah! here one would fain follow it unto the perfect day! 'lMoon-light! peace, memory, retrospection, growing almost to pain! Ah Miss Moreton, these are our teachers: what need of books? What book-men can teach us would never compensate for the loss of hours like this, alone with God -a delicious monotheism known some- times out of Jewry. Is this craving for things bright and pure, only estheticism? I can better realize Shelley's con- ceptions when Hfeel how much coarseness comes in to mar life." "Yet," said Constance, "I can also understand that the life of the disciple of such 'systems of worlds' might be in- harmonious- often, to a degree: wrought into discord by the jarring of coarser natures, it must often, with all the highest and best elements of beauty, have been 'like sweet bells jangled out of tune. " "Poor Shelley! his loathing of all coarseness - all com- monplace that must come in to clip the wings of enjoyment through all the free avenues of aesthetic life- was not Syb- aritism. It was caught from a philosophy too pure for his age; as Dudevant says, 'Beings destitute of conscience and' virtue, we need heavy chains. The improvements of which some generous spirits dream cannot be realized in such an age as ours: those spirits seem to forget that they are a hundred years in advance of their contemporaries, and that, before they   IN A -CRUCIBLE.         173 change the law, they must change mankind. Had Shelley lived later, he had seen the fallacy of his Utopian schemes; would have seen his stars turned to magic-lanterns that only reflected grotesque images-his mists to white sheets that enveloped grave-yard ghosts, instead of dim, airy spirits - his beautiful creation of the Divine Source distorted into a hideous, grinning idol. But he was spared the finger of iconoclasm in an iron age of scoffs, derisions, and shams: 'For the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that honor feels, And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.'" "We are advancing to better things now, I trust; great possibilities open upon us. An era of war is one of grandeur -this is an experimentumn crucis, from which we may rise purified, and prepared for a glorious future," said Constance. "Yet, we are also to consider the probability of defeat: can you bring your mind to it?" "Not I; and if that were possible, I could never think of our men as anything less than heroes. Do you think defeat could make General Lee anything less than the military genius of the age? Napoleon says truly that 'every age finds its type in the characters that its history exalts' -and ours will not bear detraction when it boasts such men as Lee and Stonewall Jackson." "Ay; and would not that age vaunt its own infamy that could exalt a Lincoln and martyr a Davis? Ah, Constance, in the hearts of their people at least, our leaders need fear no echo of that false apothegm, that 'success is the test of merit.' But it-is growing late, and I must ride." Her horse had strayed some little distance from the spot, and was cropping the herbage, with the rein hanging loosely on his neck. It was a fine half-breed Arabian, with large  eyes full of softness and intelligence, clean, strong li)s. apqd short ears, wide quivering nostrils, and a qervous restlessness that grew quiet in obedience to the accustomed voice.    174         IN A CRUCIBLE.        -  She gathered the rein in her left hand, laid' her right firmly on the pommel, and vaulted lightly into the saddle, without displacing a fold of her habit, or displaying more I than a slight glimpse of' the delicately encased foot. She : rode well, holding the rein well up in hand, and curbing  j the fiery bounds of the animal as much by force of will as by restraint of the small, gloved hand --a force of which the fiercest brute is perfectly cognizant, and by which alone he, may be ruled in the frenzy of brute passion. Constance watched her admiringly as every bound of the animal be- trayed her perfect horsemanship; then she fell once more to thinking on that face as she had seen it under the vines--dis- burdened, for onee, of' the weight of care that usually en- throned the lips.                    - Parolet drew her rein at the brow of the hill. Far away, on the right, the eye rested upon the broad landscape bathed in evening sunlight. There were green glades and steep de- clivities, where forest verdure .grew thickly. There were great stretches of waving cornfields, where coveys of wild partridges swirled up with a frightened rustle, and flocks of crows chattered and cawed over the ripe grain. In and out through the broadening vista, glimpses might be snatched of snug country-houses dotting the hillsides, and the eye rested, with a pleasant sense of peacefulness, on the curl of smoke that struggled slowly upward in the golden light. Out of sight, far away among the whispering pines which lifted their solemn crowns in the crimson splendor, the hoarse swirl of the river might be heard, with the occasional dip of an oar, as some tiny craft sought her moorings at the day's close. On the left the highway wound through broader openings to the village of St. Bevins, clustering among the hills. With a long breath of enjoyment, Parolet turned her   IN A CRUCIBLE.         175 horse's head sharply to the right, and struck out into the narrow beaten path that led to the river. Her face was full of bright, softened light, as she plunged into the cool solitudes of nature. The sharp ring of the animal's hoofs grew swifter as she gave him the rein and brought the slender jewelled rod smartly across his arched neck. The evening air blew coolly as she struck the river- bank and paused again, looking about her with that keen sense of enjoyment which One feels in uninterrupted com- munion with nature. Here are the voices that speak to the soul! - here the sweet commingling of sound and color that melt into harmony the spirit. The voice of God and Nature!- and man forgets that far away the busy strife of the world enchains the soul, and beats it down in-the dust of toiling greed and lust of gain. The hoarse murmur of the vox populi reaches his ear no longer. He has a faint sense of premonition which leads him to the hour when, standing on the verge of time, he shall madden at its call no longer--when the fevered pulse has throbbed its last under the discordant symphony of worldly ambition, and grows calmed into1 gentle harmony of perfect concords - when man lifts up his listening ear at last, to catch the whisper of the voz Dei, with the shadow of sin lifted from his brow, the light of the soul proclaiming that perfect man- hood won from his Creator. All below was in shadow-deep, solemn shadow, with the river growing into murky darkness as the dusk of evening gathered, with heavy drooping water-lilies nodding on their stemls, swaying gently with the motion of the water; and looking down, still nearer into its murky depths, long trailing plants coiled about, peopling a .phantom world with shadows. Overhead the light of evening still ligered. Crimson light rested, like flame-crowns, on the tufted pines, and wold and sky flashed back the dying radiance of the sun.   1.76         IN A C RUCIBLE.            I Gigantic cloud-masses in the east' caught the purple and  orange banners of the west, and flung a royal panoply over the fast-darkening sky. Parolet watched the quivering rays. Darkness below, light above! The tender eyes grew dusky with the shade of chastened feeling. The light overhead had more power over her then than the shadows at her feet. The earnest, questioning face bent over the water, and crystal  drops plashed slowly into its bosom. Only a few moments  of that earnest communion, and the strong, pure light of her better nature came into the face. Power was hers, for good as for ill! She loved the light overhead: it should be hers - the oriflamme of crimson light that was stealing heavenward - not the clinging shadows of the cold river. The pupil of the eye dilated; the swift current of emotion flushed into the handsome face; and though the lips were folded closely together, there was pleasantness and peace in their softened curves, as she once more threaded the hillside path home- ward. The even strokes of Belial's feet once more broke the silence, and on they sped through the gathering darkness. The pebbles flew sharply under foot, and occasional flashes died quickly out as the iron shoes struck the flinty road. With his small head set eagerly forward, and the faintest flutter through his widening nostrils, the gallant beast strained his well-strung muscles to the task. Flecks of foam flew from the curb he champed impatiently, and stained his glossy sides, as the merciless rod fell repeatedly on his quivering flesh. Miles and miles of the winding road are left behind ere a sharp turn brings them into a path that -skirts the stately enclosure of Moreton Place, and the dew clings heavily to Parolet's dark dress and the sable plume that shades her face.

They were well matched -mistress and steed! Parolet puts her gloved hand on his neck, and laughs exultingly: "A hard race, Belial, and a drawn game. What a steed for a soldier! and how well I would like to try yo6ur mettle! I chafe at Fate, as you do at the curb, in times like these." She patted the horse again, more gently, laughed a pleasant laugh, and, slipping the bridle and loosening the girths, gave him his freedom. She came into the ruddy light, wringing the dew from her heavy locks, and pushing the jaunty velvet riding-casque from her forehead. Her square, massive forehead was glis- teining white with the cool dews and night air; her eyes were sparkling brightly; and flinging herself down on the warm pile of the velvet rug, she stretched her hands to the light and laughed gleefully. "I won the race, and here is the light--warm, loving light."  It was warm, clear, and pleas- ant, but she was, scarcely thinking of it as she lay sunning, herself in it, with her head bent down on her arm. Her face was soft and tender, and full of another light- stronger, purer, and clearer. Suddenly she sprang up, and rang the bell sharply. "Are there any letters, John?" she asked of the serving-man who answered it. Yes, there was a letter, with a foreign post-mark; and dropping on her knees on the rug, she bent eagerly forward in the firelight--then paused a moment. It had been a good d   y-a happy one! She had swept away the clouds with a strong hand: would this letter bring them back, or would it rift them asunder, and let in a broad gleam of the crimson oriflamme?  She paused, the light changing rapidly on her face, and the fluttering scarlet lips full of questionings. Then her head went down into her two broad, white hands, and she whispered: "God be merciful!" The letter had slipped to the floor, and she raised it once 8*   178         IN A CRUCIBLE.  more to the light. It had been readdressed, and in an un.- familiar handwriting. The Moreton crest had been broken; yet, in resealing, it had been brought together, showing only a ghastly, rugged seam across the centre. She smiled as she saw the arrogant device: the battered shield, the hand clasped firmly over the bolt, and the delicately engraved device: "Roi ne puis; Prince ne daigna; Rohan se suis!"  Then  she rapidly tore away the envelope, and her eager eyes fell upon the page. Breathlessly she perused the closely written sheets-the shadows hurrying over her face; then   the paper fluttered from her fingers, and the great, dark eyes-bent themselves on the light before her. There are women easily moved to tears-tears of joy, of thankfulness, of bitter pain. This woman's face had erewhile borne that sadder impress of proud, passionless existence-- the death-in-life that robs a woman's face of all attractive- ness. She rarely wept. The lines on the brow -grew deep, and the sudden folding of the lips -"a trick that only crime or sorrow teaches "-told that she was deeply moved. Now there were neither tears nor sobs; the great brown eyes were lustrous with unshed moisture-the white throat fluttered once or twice with that painful gasping sound--then the lips moved softly, and sweet lines came about the brow and' chin: "God be thanked!"One dreary burden was lifted from her strong shoulders. She could proudly claim her lineage. After a little, she turned again to that passage in the letter, conning it over and over, as we are fain to do when some great happiness bursts through its faded pages upon us: ' "I will not dwell now upon details, which shall all be filrnished in my next. The priest at St. Xavier, Loci, is my informant. He says the marriage can be proved beyond a doubt, though he was not the officiating clergyman. He   IN A CRUCIBLE.         179 is to give me an interview as soon as he returns from a visit to the country; and I shall then learn all the particu- lars relating to Mrs. Trevor's mother-her life and family. This, as you will conceive, is of the highest importance; as, through the contradictory evidences it affords to that of the father, it may furnish Mrs. Trevor with a hopeful certainty of opposing force. She seems, as yet, of a nature to require something nearer, more tangible, than religion." The rest of the letter ran into personalities with which she had no concern, and she laid it aside. Again a long unbroken silence followed, during which she seemed to have formed some sudden resolution. She rose, took the faded packet of her inheritance from the drawer, and brought it to the fire. A moment she hesitated, then the resolution on her countenance deepened, she bent forward, and, hastily averting her face, -thrust them into the red bars of the grate. The flames did not take them greedily. They crisped brown at the edges, and the writing grew distinct under the hot clasp of the flame. She remained watching them, her face full of doubt, of fluctuating purpose--shud- dered as a familiar sentence startled her eye; then the writing slowly faded, and the embers fell rudely away, en- veloping  the fragments. She gave a  long sigh of relief, whispering, "God has helped me--shall I not help myself? 'Something nearer than religion ' What is nearer?" Later on, she stood at her casement. The lights of the little village gleamed out across the way; the faint murmur from the streets was broken occasionally by the sharp echo of footfalls on the stone pavement, or the rattle of cab-wheels. Far beyond, she could see the heavy arches under which she had stood in her soaking garments three months before, despairing; and now, God had been good to her. He had taken the sense of shame from her; she had not been un-   180         IN A CRUCIBLE. worthy of his notice. He had drawn her to him through the avenues of her grateful heart, and she would prove her right to the peace He had promised - and win it I The moon had risen, and looming up in its soft white light was the stately pile of Moreton Place. Feathery elm and silvery birch rustled softly on the broad stretch of lawn, and beyond gleamed the long row of broad-arched windows, their heavy stone mullions twined about with creeping ten- drils of English ivy. Lights glimmered through the green clusters; and dark against the sky arose the peaked roof and many gables of the family mansion. On the extreme left was the heavy octagonal tower in which was Arthur's study; and glancing across, Parolet saw a light burning dimly in an upper room  of the turret: Arthur's bedroom. As she watched it she could trace forms obscurely flitting to and fro, and then it suddenly disap- peared, only to gleam forth through the study window. These rooms had been closed and dark since Arthur's absence, and she wondered as hour after hour -its steady gleam traversed the broad shell walk. Her last look through her folded curtain showed her its clear amber, and then she fell asleep. She might have slept hours, or only minutes, when she rouses to a confused sense of a voice calling up to her through the casement. Her senses numbed with the stupor of deep sleep, she begins slowly putting on her garments, and fumbles for a light. There is perfect silence, and she is still doubtful of the voice, but opens the casement and looks out. A tall form ! wrapped in a heavy riding-cloak steps forward under the  i shadow of the porch, and then the silvery voice of Constance Moreton breaks the silence. "Mrs. Trevor, will you come down to ua at once? Reginald is here, and wishes to see  ; you."  She is too bewildered to think what all this may mean, and goes down the stairs groping with her outstretched'   IN A CRUCIBLE.         181 right hand, though the small brass lamp she carries in her left sends a stream of light before her as she moves. Constance comes'up to her, looks compassionately into the chilled, white face, and taking the lamp from her, whispers, "Captain Trevor is ill, and Reginald has come for you--to take you to him. Will you go? " She is wide awake now; and, standing in front of Reginald Moreton, says sharply: "Are you telling me the truth, Mr. Moreton? Is my hus- band only ill?" "He was very ill when I left him two weeks ago. I promised to bring you to him. Will you go?" A swift, indescribable look passed over her white face; still, she made no answer for several minutes. "Did he send you?" she questioned. "I promised to bring you; he was very restless until then: I am quite sure he wants you with him." There was another pause; then she drew nearer to him, and her lips motioned one question more: "Will he die, Mr. Moreton?" Reginald looked curiously into the questioning face; then he said, very slowly: "There was no hope for him when I left. You may possi- bly find him alive.  Will you come at once?  The train leaves in half an hour." "   **,   CHAPTER XTX. ELECTIVE AFFINITIES.

WHEN Parolet returned to her room the fire was still burn. ing with a dull red glow between the grate-bars.    A thick covering of gray ashes was gathering on the smouldering embers, and the fantastic outline of the frail fire-fabrics was  dimly visible, as the light from her lamp flashed out over the  X room.  She struck the poker violently between the bars, and a shower of red sparks rose hissingly, into the blackened i mouth of the chimney.   She watched them   in an absent,  dreary fashion, scarce heeding, and with a sudden recollection  , bent her head down and laid her cold cheek against the      j marble mantel. She felt so lonely, so friendless   Her face wore a touching expression of sadness, as it lay so still and  l white against the cold marble; but it was not distorted with that passionate grief which only the loss of some idolized object can give, nor stamped with the stony, fixed aspect of : despair. His death released her from a dreary bondage--   one under  which her soul had sickened and grown faint.   She had often  longed, passionately, for freedom, as a captive bird struggles i in the toils of the fowler.  She had fought down her re- 182 -  lea     1   IN A CRUCIBLE.        183 pinings--bhad rendered gentleness and obedience -had won patient smiles to her lips; but she had shuddered under the leprous taint of her unholy bonds. Now, the dreary waste of years vanished; the pulses of her heart thrilled at that near whisper of freedom. Patient, untiring, well-earned freedom was hers at last! Then she remembered her husband's kind- ness - his boisterous fondness; and a dull sense of pain crept about her heart. He was her only friend, in all the wide world she could claim no other. Then, remembering Ar- thur Moreton's letter, and her own ,whispered speech, she murmured: "God, obe Thou my friend! Hush this wild whisper in my heart." She paused: should she add more? What the words that should have been in the wife's prayer? The strife was short and sharp; then the white lips struggled once more into speech: "Give him life, O0 God! if it seem good unto Thee; and teach me submission!" There was a long pause before she began mechanically arranging a small travelling-sack; and her task was scarcely completed when she heard Reginald's step below. She went down immediately, and found Constance with him. She came up to Parolet, saying: "I am very sorry, Mrs. Trevor. Will you leave me anything you wish attended to, in trust. I should like to do something for you." "You are very kind," began Parolet: then the full lip quivered, and the large eyes lost sight of the pale face look- ing into hers. She bent forward: "Will you kiss me, Miss Moreton. I would like to carry a woman's kiss on my lips, and her face in my heart. I would be stronger for such a memory." It was not exactly the speech Constance had expected; but she bent her cold lips to the warm, red'ripe mouth that was still quivering with emotion, and pressed the soft hands between her own. Reginald had walked apart, and, after a momentary pause, came back, and touching Constance's lips   SA         x IN -A CUTCIBLE. With his own, silently offered his arm to Mrs. Trevor. As they entered' the street, Parolet glanced over the dimly lighted lawn to Moreton Place. The moon was sinking down, a fiery red crescent, in the west, and a dim, gray light showed the faint stars fast fading out in the vault/ over- head. They walked rapidly on until they reached the market; then Reginald turned, and looked into his companion's face. They had been walking very rapidly, and she seemed fatigued. Her hand lay on his arm; and, without speaking, he turned suddenly into the market-house, the iron gates clanging noisily behind them. It was dark, silent, and deserted; but at the further end a burning brazier guided them to a stall where hot beverages were served to the early and late traveller, and here Reginald paused. " Give this lady some hot coffee, Pierre," he said. She made no comment, but passively accepted the smoking beverage, and began swallowing it in hasty gulps. "You have plenty of time," said Reginald, quietly, taking out his watch, and bending to consult. it by the light of the brazier. Then he glanced at her wrappings, saying: " Can you wait here a moment ? " Without pausing for an answer, he turned to the stall- keeper, saying: "Pierre, take care of this lady until I come back." The old man nodded; and Reginald went hastily out into the street, and began rapidly retracing his steps in the direc- tion of Moreton Place. He was gone a long time; but Parolet sat absently where he had left her, gazing into the brazier, and warming her feet at its dull, glowing heat. There were noises in the upper end of the market, and the stall-keepers began arranging their wares, and bandying jests, or whistling merrily, as the clatter grew louder and louder.   IN A CRUCIBLE.        . 15 Then Reginald returned, and Parolet saw that his errand had been for her, and thanked him with her eyes. He turned to her, saying: "We must hurry now; it. wants but a few moments to the hour." Again they threaded the narrow streets of the little rail- way village, with the gray morning breaking around them, and the familiar objects grouping themselves indistinctly in the half light. Parolet remembered when she had last stood there, as they turned in under the dark arches. She would have put out her hand then, and marred her destiny; yet - Fate had guided her to the feeble spark of light whose glim- mer had begun here, and would end-where?  In full, per- fect light! It must be so! Ah! the newly sprung hope was so sweet, so strong! Suddenly she felt Reginald's eyes bent upon her face, and hastily averted it. They stood quite silently, listening, until the startled scream of the engine rang loudly through the arches, and in a few moments they were whirling away from St. Bevins. Reginald again provided for her comfort, heaping the seat with cushions and wrappings, and making a soft resting-place for her weary head and'limbs. He was assuming that sort of authority which is always pleasant to a woman, and she tacitly accepted the position. When he had arranged things to his satisfaction, and seen her head pillowed on the cushions, he overturned the second seat in front of her, and sat down under the lamp. The car they occupied was almost empty, and the lamp burned but dimly, throwing his own face in shadow, and with only a dull- gleam shining on the recum- bent form and drooping face before him. She had had little sleep; but the restless motion of the eyelids betokened the fever of a sleepless brain; and Regi-  nald's keen eyes scanned the face narrowly. She was uncon- scious of his observation, at first, and ere long the eyes half   186           IN A CRUCIBLE. opened, and the rapid play of expression in their dusky depths did not escape him. She was thinking of- her future: not as many women might--not with sweet, peaceful dreamings of a new life full of love and happiness. She was thinking only of her freedom--of the full promise of her youth and strength. Freedom of heart and mind and soul -to follow the health- ful impulses of her nature-to rise above the crushing in- fluence of the miserable past!    There were strong voices whispering into her ear, as she lay there under the pitiless eyes of Reginald Moreton.   He was reading her truthfully.. He knew what slumbering spirit had roused up       and was sending  the throbbing tide through her veins.     He knew right well what the restless curving of the short upper lip, the tremulous flutter of the nostril betokened: "The intense life in her, The tenacious embrace of her strong character, Had seized and possessed what in him was akin To the powers within her; and still, as within Her loftier, larger, more luminous nature, These powers assumed greater glory and stature." It had waked to life the still blood in his azure veins too often to mistake it in another; yet it was a worthier ambition than his manhood had ever known that had stirred the cur- rent at Parolet's heart.   The nobler cravings of her youth had come back to her.   The echo of some half-forgotten lines of "Uhland" rang in her ears: "Our youthful fancies idly fired, The fairest, visions would embrace; These with impetuous tears desired, Float upward into starry space; Heaven upon the suppliant wild Smiles down a gracious No - in vain The strife! Yet be consoled, poor one, For the wish passes with the pain. . "But when from such idolatry The heart has turned, and, wiser grown   'IN A CRUCIBLE.          1 In earnestness and purity, Would make a nobler plan its own - Yet, after all its zeal and caie, Must of its chosen aim despair- Some bitter tears may be forgiven By man at least - we trust, by Heaven"' Of its. motives he knew nothing; he only smiled to read aright the passion whose spring lay so deep in his own breast. A woman's ambition must have seemed a paltry thing in his eyes. "Woman's pleasure! woman's pain I Nature made them blinder motions Bounded by a shallower brain!" Matched with man's, its glory faded, as her passion did: as, "water unto wine." He who had trodden the wine-press, trampling the vintage with resolute feet, and grown drunk with the purpling cup, smiled scornfully under his bearded lip as the woman's trans- parent face betrayed its secret to his mocking eye: an eye under which she was, at last, growing restless. Her flutter- ing lips breathed out a long, sharp breath; and   then a pair of eyes as resolute as his own glanced scornfully upon him. Her voice was not loud   or full; but it broke out'generally with a clear, unwavering inflection, startling the ear like the sudden striking of pure metal. "Mr. Moreton, will you oblige me by changing your seat? or shall I assume the more unpleasant alternative of moving my own? The light falls unpleasantly on my face." It was a clear, straightforward blow: she never resorted to subterfuge in speech or action. She gave others, as she did herself, an alternative--nothing more. Reginald rose, came quietly round, and took his seat behind her extemporized couch. He was perfectly imperturbable, and   sat for some moments looking  out into the struggling daylight. Parolet had not noticed the smile that quivered over the handsome mouth, or she might have been puzzled to account for it.   188         IN? A CRUCIBLE. His change of position had not affected his range of ob- servation in the least. Just opposite to the face he was so desirous of studying, hung a mirror, into which the form and face framed themselves under his direct observation. He was thinking of her speech. Condemn her as he might, he was not inclined to forget in what she merited his approba- tion. There was nothing false or artificial about her. The lights and shadows were clear and strong: as natural as the peachy bloom of the cheek, or the rare-ripe red of the haughty lips. ,His undeviating scrutiny was not well repaid after her sharp challenge; for the features sank into repose, and the heavy lashes lay motionless on her cheek. After a long while he bent down and scrutinized her face more closely. He had never seen it in so attractive a light. It was sweeter and softer than he had imagined possible. In sleep, perhaps, it was nearer to God and nature. It was too self-reliant, often, to please him. Now, it was the tender, gentle face of dependent, unprotected womanhood; and the man's chivalry came to his aid. He rose softly, turned the light down so that he could watch her no longer, and resumed his seat. He bent his head back, and returned to a train of thought scarcely pleasanter than that which he had put so resolutely to flight. By what right should he mock the dreamings of this woman -by what right question her life? His own manhood had been wasted; wasted, though green laurels had crowned his brow-- though the free fields of man's noblest aspirations had been open him, as they could be to -no woman, and he had trodden ruthlessly forward to one end I Yet even now, with the great failure of his hopes staring him in the face, he was not one to cry: "What thrice-mocked fools are we?"The master passion of his life clung to him still. Failure was bitter; bitter enough to wash away fall memory of his early triumphs - to make him look back upon the past as upon an empty void. Yet the proud courage of   IN A CRUCIBLE.         189 the man triumphed over disaster and defeat. There was always a future for a hand resolute enough to seize victory in the jaws of defeat. Patrician though he was, he did not scorn the voice of the people. The applause of the senate, the rude cries of lusty yeomen, when they shouted their carmen triumphale, was sweeter to -his ears than the dulcet notes of woman-more seductive than her sweetest smiles; and his own musical voice syllabled his Io triumphe to the rude jargon of the ballot-box and the slow verdict of his country's jurymen! !   CHAPTER XX^           - IN WHCH A PUNTER MAKES 'HS FIRST PAROLET, AND "OSES! ....  .. . " It behooves Men that render sentence, to be free ' From either hate or love, anger or pity: For where the least of these do hinder, there The mind not easily discerns the truth." Ben Jonson. RAILROAD  travelling is terribly monotonous. It was doubly so to Parolet, who could only sit idly gazing through the windows, or bury her thoughts from the searching eyes of her companion. He had offended her no more after that first repulse; but she knew that she, not the paper he held, occupied the larger portion of his thoughts, and she sedu- lously avoided conversation of any kind. Her countenance she had never learned to veil; and, indeed, felt quite indif- ferent to his praise, or condemnation. It mattered little to her whether the world censured the musings into which she had fallen. Its commendation had too often been withheld when she had sorely craved, and - earned it! She had done her duty, they might say--nothing more. But duty was over now! She could claim something better: something of which the world could not rob her. The cramped, artificial life had not taught her hypocrisy; and she scorned to feign, even in the presence that bitter experience had taught her to dread. He might be pitiless, but she was candid and honest. No womanly artifice lured him to soften his judgment. Regi- nald, on his part, was somewhat puzzled that she had so quickly divined his thoughts; yet he was not so entirely observant of her as she imagined. 190   IS A CRUCIBLE.         191 Men are rarely so engrossed by women as to remain in- different to the wider purposes of life; and it was only in the interval between deeper and graver thought that he returned to his study of the woman before him. Suddenly, he re- membered his diagram: strange, it had never recurred to him before! It had almost slipped his memory-that tiny scrap of paper on which he had jotted down his judgment of her --and that judgment he seemed not likely to alter  Yet it was possible she might force him to it: not consciously -that would mar all. Had she stumbled upon that scrap of paper? and if she had, would she be at all governed by it in her conduct, or in her estimate of himself? The latter clause was more than likely. A smile crossed his lip. It was a game of life in which he was only a looker-on - not an actor: not even an interested spectator; unless his intense love of experimental knowledge made him one. A-game of life! where he held light stakes, and could afford to lose; but hers were fearfully heavy. She was likely to play it out daringly-quite unmindful of his own moves; and any blunders she might make were not to be attributed to igno. rance. He remembered to have seen a game of faro once, at a faro-bank in Paris. He remembered with what interest he had seen the colors come up; and how that interest had been deepened by the cool audacity with which the stakes had been doubled, trebled, quadrupled until the hoarse voice of the gaillieur calls out, "Soixante, et le va," and the stakes are swept from the board. They were cool hands; and look- ing into the faces of the punters, one might be baffled at - guessing who had won or lost his parolet. What a strange fancy in Cecil Chandos to bestow upon his only child such a name! Just now, the connection was forcible. Whichever won or lost, neither would cry peccavi. He opened his pocket-book, and followed his idle fancy. Blue, yellow,   192        IN A CRUCIBLE. black, red; then glancing at her with a smile, he entered a nominal stake, and turning up a leaf of his note-book, made, a parolet. "We shall see," he thought; "yet if I win, that face is not likely to afford me much satisfaction." A voice at his elbow startled him: "You are making up a game of faro, monsieur. Shall I enter stakes? I will venture a parolet." The voice was not an -unpleasant one, and the speech was made in a half-bantering tone, that prevented Reginald's taking any offence. The speaker was a Frenchman, who, occupying the seat just behind him, had been an amused wit- ness of his movements. Reginald shook his head, saying, with a smile: "Only an idle fancy to wile away time: my stake, you see, is only a nominal one." "You are acquainted with the game?" said the French- man, politely. "Only slightly; my knowledge has never extended beyond that of an on-looker." At the sound of her own name pronounced by a stranger, Parolet had turned suddenly, with a questioning surprise; but a few words sufficed to satisfy her that their conversation could not relate in any way to her, and she resumed her old attitude. It was an unpleasant night; dark and cold, with a raw wind blowing from the east. After a silence of some moments, the stranger hoisted the glass, and thrust his head out; but drew it hastily back, muttering: "Mort de Dieu! The wind is vicious." "An ugly night," returned Reginald. The Frenchman closed the sash, and drew his roquelaure more closely around him. "An ugly night, and an ugly road. It is possible to have some ugly accidents on this route. Are you accustomed to travelling? ,"   # IN A CRUCIBLE.        193 Reginald's glance followed his through the window, before he replied. It was, as he had said, an ugly road. They were running at full speed along the top of a steep embank- ment, with an ugly chasm yawning -on either side; and an occasional- rift in the clouds, as the moon looked out, showed the frightful extent of damage which would inevitably ensue upon any interruption to the mad speed with which they were steaming over the uneven road. It was in frightful want of repair, and occasional lurches swung the heavy train from side to side, with a giddy, toppling motion. Reginald glanced uneasily at the face of his companion. He could not tell whether she had heard the remark addressed to him. She was looking out of the window, but her face was perfectly tranquil. "At all events," he thought, " she is not likely to trouble me with any foolish fears." Then he replied aloud: "I am all old traveller; and one who has scaled the Alps is not likely to grow pale at a chance of danger here. I never anticipate trouble." "And madame?" questioned the French man, with a bow i the direction of Parolet. Reginald colored: "Your, remarks are not likely to remove any timidity the lady may feel." He leaned forward, in some solicitude: "Pray do not alarm yourself, Mrs. Trevor. I believe all apprehensions are groundless. I am vexed that you should have been disturbed." "I am not alarmed," she returned, quietly. "I have often braved greater perils." The discomfited Frenchman once more broke the silence: "Pardon, madame. I spoke without thought. It is only too possible that some Union-lover might interfere with our night-journey; but it is not necessary, therefore, to lose one's sleep." And true to his philosophy, he buried his head on his arms, and relapsed into silence. 9   194         IN A CRUCIBLE., Reginald became thoughtful. He kept his eyes -on the window, and, spite of his assertion of indifference, began anxiously regarding the doubtful prospect. Parolet, too, re- turned to her watch through the window, and forgot other vexations in the uneasy anticipations awakened by the careless words of the stranger. The night grew apace, and there had been no cause for alarm. Their headlong speed had never slackened, and Reginald began to think all appreheision groundless, and to settle more at his ease, when a heavy lurch threw him forward, striking his head violently against the framework of the window. A succession of shocks followed rapidly, the heavy passenger train swaying from side to side, and then, after an instant of suspense, and a quivering motion that ran from car to car, with a heavy clank of chains and the harsh grating of the wheels, the huge mass swayed heavily to one side, and went crashing down the steep em- bankment. - It was an accident that had given some seconds of the most fearful suspense, without affording any oppor- tunity for action. In a few moments from the time when the sudden lurch brought the engine violently up against the ob- structions, the long train lay a confused mass at the bottom of the chasm. Reginald had been violently stunned by the fall, and it was many minutes ere consciousness returned: then he en- deavored to rise, but sank back, faint and giddy, and with a sickening sense of the horrors of the situation creeping over him. He had been thrown free from the car- whether pre- cipitated through a door or window, he never knew. He was in no condition to move, and could only lean on his elbow, looking upon the horrors of a scene where he was powerless to aid. Cries, shrieks, and groans greeted his ear; mangled bodies and the ghastly faces of corpses met his eye; and he dared scarcely venture a second glance, fearing to find among them that of his companion. Again he closed his eyes, and   IN A CRUCIBLE.          195 lay there prostrate and passive, while such of the survivors as had escaped unhurt endeavored to rescue the sufferers who lay buried under the train. After a long interval, he again roused up, and, assuming a sitting posture, leaned his back against a tree, and peered eagerly forward, striving to gain a glimpse of his companion. He was quite screened from ob- servation, and from his slight elevation could command a full view of the scene of the disaster. The moon, shining out fitfully, discloses sights and sounds from which he turns shudderingly. He can only look: he is impotent to aid. There are no bones broken, but he is terribly crushed and bruised, and is too faint to attempt to rise. Suddenly, he sees Parolet. Slhe is quite unhurt. Her escape seems almost too miraculous to be true! She is pale and frightened; and, like him, she kneels there, gazing into the faces around her. Another glance at the kneeling figure, and he bends forward and watches her intently. She is unaware of his vicinity; and for minutes, which seem terribly long in such a scene, there is no change in either face or attitude: then she rises slowly, a swift indescribable change passes over the face, and she moves forward. The motionless form of a child lies near her. She bends down, raises it in her arms, and puts her hand over the heart. After another moment, she just touches the little blue lips with hers, and folds the little form to her warm bosom. She knows it can gain no warmth there, and he reads all that is written in her face as she lays it gently down once more on the damp sod. After that, she moves forward, and begins searching slowly among the faces around for-his own, he thinks, with a faint thrill. Her search is fruitless yet; but she stops sometimes to straighten the dead, or pillow the bruised forms of the living. "Baffled, by Jove!" exclaims Reginald, sinking back once more. He is thinking of that look. What did it mean? He has never heard that little story of the Neapol-           ;         .(   196        IN A CRUCIBLE. itan queen; and his penetration is at fault. He had seen her after that look performing quiet, womanly offices, in a womanly way: not eagerly or compassionately, perhaps; still, she had done it. He watched her no longer. He lay on his back, looking up at the moon, and watched the jagged edges of the clouds as they skirted over it. He was thinking of the sleeping face, on that first night: how very sweet and peaceful it was! comparing it with that stony, sphynx-like gaze that had riveted his eye when she knelt there only a few feet from him, all unconsciously. She could be lovable enough, if left to herself: why torment her further? Why disquiet himself longer with any thought of her? Yet, so thinking, he came to feel that it was not so easy to put her out of his thoughts: that he could never be indifferent to her slightest word or act again! He had never been baffled in his life. It was something new, and not unpleasant, to find himself a loser in any game--even this slight one he had set up for his amusement. "Diable! you are hurt, mon ami;" and with an ugly oath hissing out under his silken mustache, the Frenchman raised Reginald's head, and looked into his face. "Not much; only I cannot move just yet. Can you fetch me some water?" "Not moche! Ah! it is quite true, if one shall judge by your face. I was not sure if you breathed. Only a minute it took for these Union-lovers to win a terrible victory over some women and children, and one or two brave soldiers, like yourself.?Felled trees! it might have been worse! A down train thundering into us would have given no chance to moralize, but it would have been accidental, and--not so devilish. Excuse me, but lafemme is unhurt; shall I fetch her? A woman's hand, you know." "You mistake," said Reginald, coloring; "the lady is not my wife.- Her husband is an army officer. He is dying in   TN A CRUCIBLE.         197 Virginia; which renders this delay very vexatious," he added, 'with a-sigh. "Ah I I did not see; but I will let madame know, at all events, that her escort is safe;" and he sauntered off, mutter- ing, while he stroked his mustache, "Not madame's hus- f i  band--only her escort; 'necessitas quod cogit, defendit!' I suppose; mais," and the stranger gave his shoulders an un- deniable shrug, and continued, "si j'etais monsieu'r le mari, j'amerais mieux avoir un ami moins beau et moins jeune." He soon returned, bringing Parolet with him. She was very pale, and the hands she laid in his trembled violently. "I am not so brave as I thought--I am so unaccustomed to such scenes: one is quite powerless." She spoke hurriedly, and seemingly without much thought of the words that trembled through her lips. After a mo- ment, she continued: "And you are much'hurt, I fear. You need assistance; and I am so useless. Will you tell me what I must do for you?" "I need nothing, thank you. After a little, we will try and get on to the next station. I have no idea, yet, of our locality, but it cannot be far. I am only vexed at the delay on your account," "Yes--my husband," she said, quickly, turning away her head; and Reginald saw that her lip trembled. "If you will assist me to rise," he said, turning to the Frenchman, "I can, perhaps, walk." The assistance was readily proffered; but after he gained his feet he could only lean heavily against the tree. "Will you lean on my arm? I can aid you; it is quite strong and steady: see," and she held it out before him. The sleeve of her dress had been torn away, and the bare, rounded arm looked both strong and steady. But a monment before she had been trembling in every limb; now, when she could       *               I   198         IN A CRUCIBLE. be of use, she had conquered all nervous timidity. It sent a strange thrill through Reginald as he touched that proffered arm; but he found it no slight support. The station-buildingsswere crowded with the sufferers; and when after a weary half-hour they reached them, it was with difficulty that. Reginald could find a spot in which he might rest himself. This the energy of their strange travelling companion at length effected, and he sank into a deep sleep. His example was soon followed by the philosophic French- man; and Parolet was left to wear away the hours as best she might, until morning. It was a weary watch; with aching limbs, and a heart full of a vague terror lest she might never look again upon her husband's face. Inaction at such a time was terrible. She grew impatient of the darkness -of the sounds of suffering; the pale, distorted faces forcing themselves upon her mental vision, though she could see them no longer. With a mo- mentary glance in the direction of her companion, she wrapped her shawl over her head, and stole softly out, seating herself where she could catch the first glimpse of daylight, and hear the first sound of the expected train.

Anactoria. "Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean!" Hymn to Proserpinc. THE sun was just setting. An Italian sunset! its level beams striking out beyond a long vista of trees, and crimson- ing the rugged, stony path over which two men walked, facing one another.  One was just leaving the little cluster of houses on the hill, having the sunlight at his back, and coming with a slow, lingering step down the pathway. Its gentle declivity did not hasten his gait. He paused, not looking back, but listening intently as the quaint cathedral chimes struck the motionless air: motionless, for not a leaf stirred on the trees, not a bird fluttered on the boughs. Sweet, pure, and peaceful it rose with a throbbing vibration, pulsing out clear and musical, and dying faintly away.   The other foot-passenger pressed firmly forward, not pausing to Ilisten to the chimes, or letting his eyes -rest more than a mo- ment on the yellow  light that lay dying out in the west. They were keen eyes, of a'dark, clear gray, piercing in their brightness, if not roving or restless: eyes that had looked at and through men until they had learned to do their work in almost a single glance. The face was thoroughly Italian -thoroughly that of an Italian priest; the features full and 199   200         IN A CRUCIBLE. irregular; the brow low, broad, and slightly receding; full dark locks, closely cut, and dashed with gray, crowned the head and temples; and the lips --at once the best and worst feature of the face--were full of sensuality, but withal resolute, and matched well the square, heavy-set lower jaw. Neither eye nor lip sought disguise. You read as much of both as you cared, or as little. The countenance was neither passionless nor passionate, but self-contained and resolute; and the presence was dignified and commanding. Energy of character gave an air of greater youth to the man than his years warranted; and there was little of the infirmity of age in the resolute step with which he trod over the rough stones, toiling up the ascent, and perceptibly lessening the distance between himself and the stranger. The yellow light had disappeared from his face, and from the top of the cloister buildings in his rear, when the. two met. There were soft purple-gray tints in the sky, and the bells still rang out musically, when the two paused, and looked into each other's face: looked as men do when they are desirous 'of penetrating beyond the outward man, that they may divine how much or how little to trust! --one, reading the other as only a man of the world can read those around him; the other, in greater simplicity, yet not the less truth- fully. The result seemed- satisfactory, and for an instant their hands inet. Both had large, rough hands, fitted for other labor than that they had assumed. Then both figures turned, and made their way in perfect silence through the dim gray light, back over the stony road, in the direction whence the priest had come toward the cloisters. Arthurs loitering footsteps changed to accommodate the brisk stride of his companion; and from time- to time he turned his head to look upon the bronzed face of the priest. Yes; it was the face of one whom he might trust: the face of one capable of understanding all that his journey involved;   IN A CRUCIBLE.        201 all which he alone could help him to ravel: one, too well versed in all the intricate workings of the human heart for him to withhold any part of the truth: one neither to be moved by pity, or hatred, or sympathy; who would tell the whole truth if he deemed it expedient to tell any part of it, and who would have dropped no syllable except under a sentiment of its expediency. He was a man in whose hands the temporal work of the church was safely and well intrusted and who for spiritual tasks gave to the soul its full measure of work, and exacted therefrom its full measure of fruit. He had trodden to and fro this stony paththe better part of a long life; had buried great talents and great power in an obscure village cloister; had been devoid of temporal am bition, and had used temporal power only as a means of spiritual ends, worthy, if not great: a man into whose ear Arthur was to pour his own tale of strength and weakness; whose lips were to reveal a life's history, pronouncing his own doom and that of another. Judge if he was likely to come out of that interview with any mists of self-delusion! Not if a strong brain and a clear eye could aid- him : an eye and a brain that had been as relentless to himself as to others' eyes and a brain belonging to one who, if he sometimes held silence when he might have spoken, spoke only to tell the truth; whose firm lips scorned deception and falsehood, tc himself as to another. And he had said he would speak!- Well might Arthur loiter, if he dreaded the truth; but there could be no loiter- ing now, with that silent figure moving swiftly forward by his side; and his own nerve and courage grew strong once more. The last few months of his life had shamed his man- hood. Not thus should he have met disaster--even the shadowy dread, where suspense was harder to bear than the sharpest truth! In deep, unbroken silence the Italian conducted him 9*   202         IN A CRUCIBLE. through the dark entrance, over a paved court, into wind- ing corridors; exchanging mute salutations with the silent figures of the monks that were hurrying to vespers, until they at length entered the small, clean cell appropriated to himself. Wax tapers burned with a clear, steady light, in stone sconces over the chimney; the floor was spotless, the furniture simple: a true sanctuary of the priest of God, in nought defiling the soul or the body consecrated to His service. "Be seated, and welcome," he said, briefly. "I must to vespers and when I return, it shall be to redeem my promise--to give you such aid as the word of man may give; and- it will be the word of one who has gained all the wisdom frail man may glean from his Creator." He closed the door, and left Arthur to his meditations. Strange and troubled thoughts they were, that seemed scarcely real in so strange a scene. He was thinking over the words of the man who had just left him. Had he, too, not sought wisdom of his Creator? -sought it long, earnestly, bitterly! Had he not put away his love -the passion of youth and strength- because it wanted the sanction of his conscience? And he had walked in light; humbly and .thankfully for a season, until the darkness of a life dearer than his own had come between God and him! Looking upon this man's face, he began to see that his life had been a failure. Would he ever redeem it on the hither shore? Could peace be bought with a price, and be sweet when won after all toils? Faintly through the closed door, and the echoing cloisters, the low-toned chant of the priests, the heavy, sonorous vol- ume of sound from the organ, reached his ear. It was a solemn whisper of peace. Shut out from the world in a life like this, there had been no temptation but that of the flesh; the stronger seductions of the spirit could wage no warfare here! Again and again this whisper came to him; then a stronger voice:   IN A CRUCIBLE.   -      203 "Men my brothers, men the reapers, ever reaping something new; That that they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do." Ay! he was a man among men. By what right should he shirk the noble conflict of that great arena-life? Was this life? The words of Constance came to him with a new meaning: "Seeking peace at the expense of honor;" and he had no more thought of that temptation. He must fight the battle to the end, if peace never came on earth! Gradually the murmur of the chant, rising and falling on the ear, ceased its swelling cadence; the echo of footsteps along the corridors followed; then the clanging of doors, and deep silence, with lights glimmering here and there across the way. Still the deep monotone of the organ pealed out unwaveringly, and he caught the grand notes of Mozart's Dies Irct. He bowed his head and listened to this solemn vocal religion, that forms so deep a sentiment of Catholic worship: this giving to God the best fruits of art! It was long after its cessation before he heard footsteps ap- proaching his cell, and the form of the priest stood in the doorway. With a slight courteous salutation he came for- word, and took the chair opposite Arthur's, at the little table, saying: "I trust you are not annoyed at the delay. I was tempted, after vespers, to become organist for a little while. It is one of my fancies, I may say luxuries, to worship with the soul- worship of men greater than I. Only love to God could inspire such melody as that! Are you fond of music--of sacred music?" "Yes," said Arthur; " when it does not usurp the place of better religious feeling. It is only a worship of the senses." The Italian bestowed a quick glance under his bent brows on the face before him. "A worship of the senses! One could scarcely make a purer offering to God."   204         IN, A CRUCIBLE. Arthur remained silent; and after a pause, the other ques- tioned: "Is it not so?" "I thought so once; now, I think the best offering to the Creator is the perfection of the work He has begun; a work intrusted to our hands. A life of active religion best befits the creature, to complete the work upon which He has ex- pended labor. Sentiment without action, is the tree without fruit. He cursed it, you know." Again a glance, straightforward this time into the eyes of the other, and he said, with a frank, pleased smile that made the great attraction of the face: "Good sentiment does not always lead to good action, it is true; and, unless it does, there is no religion; but both are good in their way. We are here to discuss lives, not opinions: shall I lead the way? I am beginning to think my proffered aid officious, in all except what relates to facts. These are few: of surmise, there need be no end, unless you are prepared to take the word of one older, if not wiser, than yourself, and believe that all surmise should cease, where it infringes upon mys- teries that have been mercifully veiled from us." After a pause somewhat longer than any that had preceded it, he was about to begin his promised relation, when Arthur hastily interposed. "Stop," he said. "Let me first tell you that I am terribly interested in this story, though it can in no way concern me; and now tell me the whole truth, without pity or compunc- tion." "I have promised to speak, and I shall tell only the truth," said the priest, gravely. "If this miserable tale in- volve greater crime or sorrow than it has already, I shall be deeply sorry that it devolved upon me to pain you; but I shall tell the truth, nevertheless." Arthur spoke no more; and. with his head bent down, and his eyes on the floor, he awaited the next words.   IN A CRUCIBLE.         205 "Cecil Chandos was sent to me, in his extreme youth, to be educated for the priesthood. I accepted the charge, ignorantly; for I was young myself, at that time. If you knew him, you will not accuse me of prejudice when I say that he was not the material for such a purpose. He might, possibly, but for certain circumstances, have done the work of the church--the church could have done nothing for him. I soon saw that- it was only too evident, even in ex- treme youth. The mind was perfect-I have rarely known a better. The nature was corrupt and evil; yet, at that time I do not think it was utterly bad. Has it ever occurred to you Ithat there are lives which might possibly have been quiet enough in ignorance, but which, once awakened to certain truths, suddenly overthrow all restrictions?" "You believe that?" said Arthur, eagerly. "Will' you speak more fully?"  "I only suggest a possibility; but my argument is weak, seeing that I argue upon a single fact. It is possible that Chandos would have ended precisely the same, had he never made what I cannot but feel to have been a very unfortunate discovery. After the damage is done, we are apt to trace it to some known cause; we found our premises after the facts: not good logic; or rather, no logic at all. Yet it is not unal- lowable in such instances; for in studying human nature, fixed rules will not apply. However, I am anticipating events in my narrative. "The young man accepted his destiny, sullenly. He was an American--a Southerner, but with foreign blood in his veins. The prejudices of his country could hardly have weighed much with him so young; and after a long time, he became reconciled. He was passionately fond of the music of the church, and played with a power and expression rarely equalled. His research into the history and literature of the church was insatiable; his love of art excessive! I cannot   206         IN A CRUCIBLEo. tell the precise time when I began to interest myself in tracing the peculiarity of the man's mind in all these pursuits; but it left my own in a state of vague trouble. After a while, some sudden and unaccountable change came over him: fits of gloom - terrible outhreaks -succeeded by something nearer like mental terror than anything else I can conceive of! Then he as suddenly softened down; and this change was speedily accounted for. He was singularly truthful and sin- cere, with all his repulsiveness; and just before his final ordi. nation, he startled the brotherhood by one of the strangest speeches I ever heard, in which he declared himself unfit for the priesthood, and that he loved Adelaide Brinsmarte. It was a singular case, and he was left in my hands. I knew the girl--a sweet, pure, pretty creature; as unfitted to wed Cecil as to become a nun. Imagine my indignation, when I learned that he had won this girl's entire affection, and now positively refused to marry her. He would be no priest- neither would he marry! The girl was miserable; and I, like a blind idiot, believing that this was mere caprice on Cecil's part, upheld him in his determination to withdraw from the priesthood, and furthermore, threw him as much as possible with Adelaide. I knew that he loved her, and I believed he was restrained by some lingering bias of Cathol- icismn from marrying: otherwise, his conduct was unaccount- able. Though he was singular, and rather wild, I knew nothing positively evil of him. I had known that sweet girl from her babyhood, and I  could not see her droop and die and not put forth a  hand to aid her. God forgive me! my innocent plot succeeded. They were married at last, in my absence. "Later on, when I learned the truth, I could not account for that marriage except by a belief that the man's frail will had given way before the temptation her love offered. I did not return until many months after the marriage. Adelaide   IN A CRUCIBLE.         207 seemed very happy; Cecil unchanged in every respect. She feared, but loved him with her whole heart. "Late one autumn evening, as I sat writing at this table, Cecil Chandos burst into my room, looking more like a mad- man than anything else, crying: (' I must tell you now, and you will despise me. I have deceived her, but she knows the truth at last. It will kill her: I saw it in her face! Do you know who, and what I am? I have known it ever since I learned to love her; yet I married her: I touched her sweet lips with mine, her head has lain on my bosom, and the child born to-night is mine.' "Such a frenzy of passion I have rarely witnessed. I rose, locked the door, and forced him into a seat. 'Now,' I said,' tell me what you mean.' "He grew quieter, and sitting there in the chair you now occupy, he told me that fearful story. He was in the first flush of youth; the hard nature of the man had not crusted over the better and higher spring-season of that earlier life, or perhaps you and I might not have been burdened with that story. Had the truth come upon him later, he had buried it, and died mute: and who knows but it might have been better? From that hour, he saw his wife no more in life. It was best so: gentle and loving as she was, the re- pulsion and terror in her sweet eyes could not have been con- cealed. The letters you read passed between them then; and the allusions have been misunderstood by your friend: his calling it no marriage, his frequent assurance to her of her perfect freedom, were the frantic ravings of a madman. In yonder cabinet is an attested copy of the marriage certificate with which I will furnish you. Cecil Waldo Chandos and Adelaide Catherine Brinsmarte were married in the cathe- dral up at the village; and a more miserable, dastardly crime wasnever committed by man, than when Cecil betrayed her at its altar! I pity him now, though I could not then!   208         IN A CRUCIBLE. "I put the sign of the cross on the child's face-thank God it was a girl--and bestowed the singular name which seemed a shameless betrayal of his habits, and showed me into what hands I had intrusted my darling. Yes; she was very dear to me, from the hour of her birth to that of her death; land a purer, better life I have never known. I kissed her babe, and prayed that the curse upon the father's house might never descend to her: later on, I prayed that she might ever be kept in ignorance of the truth! It seems strange to me that Cecil should have kept those letters; and it was an act worthy of his whole life that he should have put them into the hands of his innocent daughter. His was a bad life if all tales were true; and after I learned all, I knew how the singular features of his mind, which had so puzzled me, had been developed. "In his studies, he had stumbled upon a knowledge which, while it lashed his ungovernable passions into fury, had fet- * tered his gloomy mind with the superstition of an unavoid- able and relentless fate. I lay particular stress upon this fact; for, having thought much and anxiously upon a history so startling, I could not but believe that that sort of mono- mania, preying upon a temper so mercurial, had led to the commission of the very crimes he dreaded. Have you ever remarked that the mania for suicide seems to possess certain families; and have you ever thought to make it a study? It is possible that family stories of such anature, recalled, and dwelt upon by excitable temperaments, become invested with a fascination so strong as to prove irresistible. This case would have been termed, by some, insanity; but I should not so designate it. At no time, I believe, was there a total aberration of mind: on the contrary, there seemed a terribly distinct knowledge of the precise features of this mental or moral disease. It, seemed to me rather a monomania of which cruelty seemed one of the prominent features: a case   IN A CRUCIBLE.         209 of diseased moral faculties, if one may so speak, of a nature extremely revolting; where the evils to which it led pre- sented a startling sameness through generations; and where ignorance seemed to have been the best safeguard. By some strange fatality it has been presented to the knowledge of nearly every member, from generation to generation: we see how, with the differences of temperament, it affected them; how all struggled under the blinding terror that failed to re- cognize a merciful cure for moral infirmity, as for physical dis- ease. The hand of the physician is needed; and that hand must not falter. I had noticed in Chandos that there were moments in which the moral faculties seemed utterly de- pressed- when the man seemed capable of the commission of any crime. The healthful influences of religion had no power over him; yet he was singularly susceptible to spiritual perceptions which could be aroused through the imagination. I have often won him to a better mood when I succeeded in arousing this faculty. In his child this peculiarity should be more strongly developed; not only that her sex is more sus- ceptible to such influences, but she should inherit strongly the pure characteristics of the mother. Yet this verys sus- ceptibility of the imaginative faculties has been a dangerous element in the man's mind. "I have watched with what eagerness he has seized upon the most revolting forms of art--seen him work himself up into an almost perfect sympathy with the evil passions there portrayed - and trembled for the results. None looking upon his face could doubt his capability for acting out the charac- ter he studied. Imagine what a mental peculiarity of this nature, added to excess of physical power, and animal pas- sions of the lowest order, was likely to effect. Yet there have been moments when this man, absorbed in some engrossing power of his strong, brilliant intellect, has undergone a trans- formation perfectly marvellous. The power of a godlike   - 210         IN A CRUCIBLE. mind seemed to arouse him to a sense of high nobility of character: his conception then would be vivid and masterly; yet these moments were rare, and became more so as he grew in years. Had he remained under my influence, I should have carefully removed from him all objects of art, works of literature, or musical compositions which seemed to exercise so baneful an influence over him. The vigorous force of his overpowering intellect should have been kept constantly exerted, yet never to a degree producing lassitude-the phy- sical energies also healthfully employed. As to religious in- fluences, I should have been careful as to the manner of their employment. Religion should never be forced: there are persons so constituted that the mind must first receive its truths, and where, until it has, forced observances are useless. We are the shepherds into whose fostering care these crea- tures are intrusted: we may carefully aid the soul in its gar- nering of the precious fruit; we cannot force it too strongly, lest, in a soil foreign to its speedy growth, it perish. "Unfortunately for my plans for this man's good, he sud- denly disappeared. Probably he tired of a watch, of which, careful as I was in its manifestations, he was perfectly cog- nizant; or, perhaps, as he grew older, he became more hard- ened in corrupt desires, and wilfully sought a palliation in that family history. He disappeared, taking his child with him; and from that day I had no trace of him until what I learned from yourself. I have been thus careful in tracing this man's mental peculiarities, that you may be enabled to say in how far they have been modified or developed in his child." He paused; but Arthur made no reply.   Vividly he had traced that likeness as, word by word, the tale of the priest fell upon his ear. No particular of that sickening story had been withheld in pity to the torture working in his counte- nance. "A disease of the- moral faculties!" These were the   IN A CRUCIBLE. .        2" words he had heard applied to her father! And he loved her I Not blindly; but oh, how passionately, how tenderly, how pityingly I With every heart-throb he was awakening to a sense of this: he was remembering the terror he had seen gathering in her beautiful eyes; terror of. man, lest he had read her terrible secret I He remembered Fenwick's story, and knew that what he read in her face standing before the portrait had been that piteous, blinding sense .of a power greater than her own, ajd relentless as fate. Then the man's passion burst forth: "God forgive me, I cannot answer you! I love this woman!" Few words and scant, in which to break the seal of that grand passion that has made men godlike! Yet they re- vealed all--the womanly tenderness, the undying pity and love of this man's nature. The face of the priest was turned aside. He had spent a long life among his fellow-men, was deeply versed in the knowledge that pertained to their passions, and he looked gently, if without much emotion, upon Arthur's sorrow. He knew all that those few words conveyed: " I love this woman!" He read the man's nature aright, and no wordy eloquence could have moved him as had those simple ones. He knew how his sensitive nature grieved under the sense of degrada- tion that attached to the woman whom, he loved: loved in spite of shame and sorrow and reproach! He rose, and laying his hand on, the bowed figure before him, spoke: "Peacel my son. This passion is no shame to you. Love, without-sin, ennobles the soul; yet manhood, and the cause you serve, ask more of you than even the purest form of worship to any of His creatures. There is work before you: work requiring nerve and courage of no ordinary degree, and an utter abnegation of self. Give your aid to render this woman worthy of something better than the purest passion   212         IN A CRUCIBLE. man may bestow. Dare you or I despise one of His crea- tures? Remember that I have told you distinctly that, while I recognize the existence of moral disease, I recognize, also, its cure, in religion: there is no other! Be this your work.: one requiring patience, careful thought, and unselfish labor. These you will render, and the issue is with Him. Your light must come from Him--by prayer! Let no delusion mislead you; and in your watch over this woman, let no prejudice ever render you forgetful that she is worthy of human charity. Above all, let it not lead you into forgetful- ness of the wide duties that claim you imperatively among your fellow-men. This woman has mind, talent, and healthful moral influences to combat evil; these it would be well to employ actively: her sex and its restrictions will aid her. If events in her life favor any conflict of her powers, it will be well: every victory of her better nature augment her sense of power; and in that sense of power lies her danger, or her salvation! For any other guidance, you must rely upon yourself, and upon such knowledge as you will gain from the unfolding of events around you. Above all, do not lose sight, in yourself, of the truth, that all temptation conscien- tiously overcome works good to the soul: even sin leaves no leprous taint on the mind that has obtained pardon of its Creator. Do not feel yourself. unworthy of his work that * you' have momentarily strayed from the, light. Courage! and seek truth in prayer." Arthur looked up into the strong countenance of the priest, strong in all that made its perfect manhood; stronger still in that perfect reliance of the soul that is only won after a life of toil. The soldierly form of the priest bowed itself as their eyes met: "sPa x vobiscum!" spoke the resolute voice, and they parted.   CHAPTER XXII. MEA, CULPA. Let us pray indeed, not to be judged, but forgiven; Pray for pardon, not penance. . . . - . Leave the judgment to IIim who alone knows the law. Man's pride must fall when it stands up in judgment." Owen Meredith. THE evening was waning fast when Arthur entered once more the streets of X    village, and sought his friend's lodgings. As he turned into the Row, drops of rain plashed down from the overcast sky, and a sudden gust of wind sprang up, causing him to hasten his steps in the effort to reach his destination ere the storm broke. As he turned the corner sharply, the little figure of Susan Warner crossed from the opposite pavement, and, passing swiftly by him so close that her skirts brushed against him, disappeared under the lighted doorway of one of the shops. It was the first familiar face he had seen since his return, and, acting upon an impulse, he sprang after her, but was only in time to catch a glimpse of the little feet disappearing at the top of a long flight of steps leading out through a side door into a by-street. He followed her no farther, but turned, retraced his steps, and a few moments' walk brought him to his old lodgings. Finding the door ajar, he entered without ringing, and ascended the stairs to Fenwick's room. Allan sat in an arm-chair at the window, through which the faintest ray of twilight entered. He was unoccupied, and the listlessness of his attitude struck upon Arthur's eye at once: the face he could not see. He rose as Arthur ap- proached, with a movement unlike his usual alertness, and 213   214         IN A CRUCIBLE. the voice, sweet and low-toned as usual, was slightly tremu- lous when he said:            e "Arthur, my dear friend, have you come at last?" Had Arthur been less wearied or harassed, he might have seen that there was something terribly wrong with Fenwick; but being both, he saw nothing. He did not even remark that he made no offer of light; and in the silence that en- suedaafter that first greeting, he found a seat. Outside, the rain now fell heavily, and the noise of the storm and the rattling of the casements made any speech an effort. I]t was Arthur who first spoke, after a long silence. "I saw Susan Warner on the street; but she either did not see me, or ran away from me. Have I changed so sadly that even old friends do not know me, or -cease to care for me?" "I do not know; I did not observe," stammered, Allan. "Have you been ill?" Arthur did not notice his embarrassment: "Ill-not bodily, certainly; but in great mental trouble, as you must have seen, if you received my letters," he replied, a little testily: struck only with Allan's want of sympathy. "Poor Arthur!" said Fenwick, softly, through the dark. ness; and Arthur did not notice the slightly contemptuous stress he laid upon the epithet. How should he have sym- pathy with Arthur's shadowy troubles, his own being such a bitter, sharp reality! Presently Arthur again spoke: "Never mind   me now, Allan; only tell me   of things at home-here, I mean. How have you been getting along?  Do you remember your uneasy predictions? Yet you see I was quite right: there is nothing like learning to rely upon one's own strength; won *as it should be, I mean, of course," he added, reverently. "Have you conquered your prejudice, and forgiven poor little Susan for having the bad taste to prefer homely old Arthur to blythe Allan?"   IN A CRUCIBLE.         215 He had made this speech quite at random-brought to it, probably, by the sight of Susan's little face; but every word had cut like a knife to Allan's heart. He could not summon courage to answer it, but sat cover- ing his face with his hand, and remained mute. Struck at last by his silence with a sudden sharp suspicion, Arthur leaned forward, and said: "Allan, you do not mean to say that you have betrayed my confidence, and that poor child?"Then, as Allan con- tinned silent, he added, bitterly: "Allan, I have loved you very dearly; but, if what I suspect is true, I could find it in my heart to despise you." "I know nothing about betraying your confidence," he said, sullenly. "I told you I was not to be trusted, from the first. As to the girl, don't blame me more than is needful. Her seduction is not to be laid at my door, at any rate." "Allan," said Arthur, sternly; "take care how you crim- inate another to screen yourself; it ill becomes one in your position." "I am not screening myself," said Allan, angrily. "A pretty opinion you must have of me! I only tell you that even the devil is not as black as he is always painted," he added, bitterly. "I'm not attempting to excuse myself; but I say that what I told you of her at first, is true. She is thoroughly bad, vicious, and silly; unfortunately for me, that impression returned upon me too late. Think as ill of me as you will; but I hope you believe that, had I not found her such as I represent her, I would have done her strict justice, at any cost to myself." Arthur shook his head. "You are deceiving yourself, Allan: I never heard a whisper against Susan Warner when I left here. She seemed such a very child. No one, except yourself, ever'looked upon her as anything else; and I thought yours a temporary ebullition of anger at her candid i            '    216        IN A CRUCIBLE. speech. I never dreamed of such an issue: God is my wit- ness!" "You do not believe me," said Allan, calmly. "Very well; I do not ask you to do so; but you will believe the girl herself, and she shall tell the truth." "No, no," said Arthur, with sudden remorse for his harsh- ness, as the hard, metallic ring in Allan's voice struck upon his ear; and he sighed deeply. "I never knew you to de- ceive me, Allan; and I suppose I must credit what you tell  me: only, if you could have married her, things would not have been so bad." "Thank you; doubtless the pleasanter alternative, to all but myself. Of course I should have done it, though; and been scarcely less miserable the rest of my life than I shall be now." "I do not know about that, Allan; though in this case you are the last to be considered. There can be nothing worse than sin: all other miseries may be borne better than remorse of that nature. Susan is not one to be ashamed of; and as to pride of birth and blood, it is all very much at variance with Christian humility." "'I cannot help it," said Allan, passionately. "I cannot help it. I could never have held up my head again." Here tears rushed into his voice, and he broke out: "And, oh, Arthur, my mother! You have not thought of her." Then he choked back further words, and remained silent. No;- Arthur had thought- of nothing but Allan's sin: there had been no room yet for anything else; but now he said, compassionately: ' "Poor Allan: you are paying only a just penalty; but it is hard that the innocent should suffer; and this will be a terrible-blow to your mother." "Yes," said Allan, slowly; "she knows nothing yet. She has still to learn that her only son, sent forth to his work   IN A CRUCIBLE.         217 with her blessing and her prayers, has brought her gray hairs to shame. If I had never been a minister--" "Never say that again, Allan," interrupted Arthur. "The sin would have been no less, though the shame might not have fallen so heavily upon you. The world only errs in not exacting stricter tithe of all men." , "I am not quite right yet," said Allan, humbly. "But I dare say I shall feel better about it after a little. I am more angered at myself than penitent, just now; but it will all come right by and by." "I am sure of it," said Arthur, quickly; then his emotion overcame him, and he brought a heavy hand down on Allan's shoulder. "Don't," said Allan, hoarsely: "don't; I do not deserve your sympathy. I'm an unpardonable villain. But you shall not take my word for the truth of what I told you about Susan. It is only due to myself, as well as to her, that you should inquire into this thing." It was very painful to Arthur, but he saw his duty plainly; and that he must put his friendship to Fenwick quite out of mind. He rose without a word, and they descended to the street. The rain still fell in torrents, and the wind drove it in blinding showers into their faces, and beat Arthur's heavy riding cloak, impeding his movements, and increasing Fen- wick's impatience. Up one street, and down another, they pursued their way until they reached Phillis Warner's cottage, and paused in the open doorway. Susan sat on a low seat by the chimney; and Arthur could, scarcely restrain his indignation as he looked at her. Her wan, white face was propped on her small hand; and her blue eyes wore a strange glitter, looking out through the tangled tresses that fell on her shoulders. The- drooping mouth, the altered figure-too slight yet to attract suspi-, cion from careless eyes, but perceptibly altered to observant 10   218        IN A CRUCIBLE. ones--told their own pitiable story! She sprang up with a startled cry when she saw Arthur's face; then stopped sud. denly in her confusion and shame, her white face flushing crimson, and her hands fluttering with a nervous motion peculiar to her; while Phillis turned sharply upon them. "Ah! is it you, Mr. Moreton? When did you get back? I'm sure you're very kind," she said, bringing out her sentences slowly, and watching his countenance narrowly while she spoke. "I have but just arrived," said Arthur, shortly; "and only painful necessity brings me to intrude upon you in the first hour of my return." Here he turned to Susan. She stood with her two hands clasped tightly over her bosom, a dusky pallor on her face, arid her eyes widely distended, with a painful expression of ' affright. The uselessness of any denial to Mr. Moreton struck her with sickening force, as the old authoritative voice fell upon her ear. When he turned his kindly face, full of sor- rowful reproach upon her, she sprang to his feet, clasping his knees, and crying, piteously: "Pray don't punish me, Mr. Moreton; don't be angry with me: I did n't know any better." "Poor child!" said Arthur, bending down, and laying his hand pityingly on her head. "Poor child! I am, sot angry with you: only very, very much grieved, Susan. : However, I am glad to see that you are not attempting to deny your guilt." He could not bring himself to believe harm of her, while she lay sobbing there piteously at his feet; though they were only frightened tears, after all. "Artful little hussy!" thought Phillis; " how she's taking him4n!" .. Fenwick had stood in the background while this scene was being enacted. He knew the source of her tears better than   IN A CRUCIBLE.         219 Arthur could. He knew that tears are a woman's. best re- source when she has nothing to say in her own defence; and he knew how quickly she would change her tactics, if she once found that she -could arouse Arthur's compassion. Stepping forward, he laid a hand on her arm, and spoke authoritatively: "Come! Susan; dry your tears. You have plenty of time for that. Perhaps you will tell Mr. Moreton that which you have always refused to tell me." Phillis interposed quickly. "Come!" she said, "I won't have the child badgered. If you are the man you ought to be, you 'll carry the girl, without more ado; and have done with all this play-acting and philandering. I'm sure Mr. Moreton will tell you it's the right thing to do." "Cease, woman!" said Arthur sternly; "I have no words for you at present. I shall see you another time, and dis- cover how much you are to blame in this matter." His speech thoroughly silenced her, and with a scowl she returned to her seat. She never ventured far with Mr. Moreton. At the first word from Fenwick, Susan had risen to her feet, and stood sullenly regarding him, a dogged resolution hardening around the corners of her mouth. One look into her face as she stood there, and Arthur's doubts as to her innocence were aroused. He motioned Fenwick aside, turned from Phillis, and spoke: "Susan, you will tell me the truth. You will tell me the name of your"- he hesitated for a word, then stammered out - " your lover." She turned her eyes slowly upon Arthur, then bent them shrewdly upon those 'of Phillis, and lastly upon Fenwick. Phillis had watched her anxiously; but a grim smile broke over her face as she saw the little lips fold themselves firmly together. "No," she said, shaking her head impatiently, and speak-   220         IN A CRUCIBLE. ing resolutely for the first time.  "No, I'll not tell. I promised him not to, and I won't: There's no use asking." "Plenty of her father's blood in the minion," muttered Phillis below her breath, and glancing triumphantly at Fen- wick; "redhot pincers won't get it out of her." Arthur exonerated Fenwick the moment that denial fell from her lips. There was something behind all this: how should he get at it ? "It was not him, then?" he said, pointing carelessly at Fenwick. "Him ! " she iterated scornfully. "No, indeed; he's only a preacher, and-" then, seeing she had betrayed herself, she stopped, with a dismayed glance at Phillis. The scowling countenance that met her own seemed to sting her into courage. With a desperate glance into the faces around, she broke out: "No, it wasn't him." Here she raised her head, her foolish little heart swelling, her voice quivering, and a glow coming into her childish face while she finished her sentence. "He was a gentleman, too; but he was a soldier- an officer: -nothing like him," she said, pointing contemptuously at Fen- wick. "I don't know why I went wrong afterward; only he struck me once, and I hated him so, I was glad to do him a harm. But I sha'n't tell any more, she added, quickly. "Please go away and leave me alone;" anf she folded her arms in her apron in a childish fashion, and sat looking sul. lenly into the fire.    CHAPTER XXTII. THE MOTHER'S RECOMPENSE.  . .. . . .. . . . . . "I pray you, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice, . . ..... ... of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away, Richer than all his tribe." Othello. "WHAT shall you do?" said Arthur, when they were once more in Allan's room. "Have you determined upon any course?" "Yes," said Allan, slowly; "I have not left my decision until this hour, and I am quite sure you will approve it. I might, in the absence of any head of the church in this State, simply resign my rectorship; but I am not disposed to shirk the consequences of my sin: that could do so little to assuage the withering sense of misery, or to lighten the burden that must rest upon my shoulders until my dying day. I shall put my case before the bishop of one of the neighboring States; though I would far rather intrust it to the kindly dispensation of him who is gone." Here the voice faltered. "I must abide by his decision, once the case is referred to him; and if I say that I hope he will give Las little publicity to it as possible, it is more on account of the cause I serve, than on my own."          i It was manly and straightforward- like, in every way, to the old, simple tactics of the Allan whom he loved so well. Yet, try as he would, Arthur could not find words. His trembling lips refused speech, until Fenwick said, sharply: 221   222        IN A CRUCIBLE. "Will you speak, Arthur? or have you condemned me too bitterly to accept even this poor palliation for my crime?"  Then he said: "You have chosen your part wisely; yet, oh, Allan! how can I, who love you so well, counsel you? God pardon me, that I am thinking less of his work than of you." It was a great grief to him to learn the unworthiness of the only friend he had ever known: one to whom the few human ties he owned, bound him in the bondage of a lifelong love, and the severance of which would cost him the most precious part of existence. Allan was, throughout, the least moved of the two. "There is one thing more, Arthur, that I must ask of you. Will you write to the bishop? Will you tell him what you have learned of this miserable story? 'Not that I wish him to consider me less culpable: he will hardly do that; only he must see that I can offer no reparation, and that there will be nothing to do in this matter but to pass sentence upon me." "Yes," said Arthur; "it would be as well that he should have a version of it from some one besides yourself; but I can use no effort of friendship on your behalf. It may sound harsh, but, although I cannot, after what has come to light, say that you ought to marry Susan Warner, I do not consider you a whit the less guilty. I would say the same were you my own brother. In any other way I will serve you gladly." "Of course," said Fenwick, sadly, "I do not ask anything of you beyond a simple statement of facts. You can hardly think worse of me than I do of myself; yet, truth to say, now that the thing is out, I feel a great deal better. I shall take the six A. M. train, and will return to you as quickly as possi- ble. You will not cast me off, Arthur? You will befriend me in one thing: you will go to my mother, and tell her I had the courage to face all but her? I will go to her when everything is settled."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         223 "Yes," said Arthur, reluctantly; "I suppose I must do that for you, too, since you ask it;" but he -was even then shrinking with a cowardly dread at the idea of going to the mother with such a tale.   i "Thank you," said Allan, simply. "You could do me no greater kindness." He put out his hand, the long, slender, womanly hand, threaded with nervous veins, and laid it on Arthur's knee: laid it with that action of clinging tenderness that was ever so endearing to the stronger nature, and said: "That was a bad job of yours, Arthur, when you saved my life, years ago: better death than disgrace!" Few words, that revealed all the sting of that pride that lay so deep in the man's nature. Long after Allan had retired, Arthur sat revolving in his mind what course would be best to pursue in reference to Susan Warner. He became sorely perplexed. His limited worldly experience could aid him little; and he knew the inutility of any application on her behalf to the female mem- bers of his own family, or, indeed, of the community at large. He thought, with dismay, of the impossibility of hunting up her seducer on the vagube information he had gained; and, sorely troubled, his thoughts reverted to Mrs. Trevor. She had the courage to aid him; and, for the moment, he forgot to question her capability; and in the relief this thought afforded him, he sought his pillow, and fell asleep. He was only awakened by Fenwick's throwing the light of a lantern in his eyes. He was dressed in travelling costume; and Arthur sat up, rubbing his eyes, and endeavoring to re- call his surroundings. "Good-by," said Allan, extending his hand. "Remember your promise about my mother. Strange, but that is the heaviest load on my conscience. I am her only son, and she a widow."   224        IN A CRUCIBLE, His lips trembled violently; and Arthur sat up in bed, thoroughly awake. He wrung the extended hand hard. "I will, Allan, my dear boy. God bless you! I'll go to her directly I have seen them all at home." "Thank you: if it goes strong against me, I'll have you to remember, old fellow, at any rate." He was going off, when Arthur called after him.: "One moment, Allan: where is Mrs. Trevor?" "With her husband, in Virginia. He is dying--dead by this time, I imagine." "Dead!" exclaimed. Arthur, starting violently; then, by a strong effort of self-command, he continued: "Is she alone? Who accompanied her?" "Your -brother. We have learned nothing since they left. I believe there was no possibility of his recovery." He paused, but finding Arthur questioned no further, went off. Arthur lay back, thinking of Parolet--of that painful journey with Reginald, between whom and herself there had been so strong a feeling of antagonism. Ah! sorrow had been robbed of its bitterness with one warm friend at her side, whose sympathies were all her own! Then, with a deep extltant throb, that died on the instant, he thought of her freedom. The strong tide of love and tenderness swept through him, blotting out all memory of her pitiful story; yet he covered his face with his hands, and trampled out the love that had been the temptation, the strength, and the beauty of his life. It was quite late when he rose and began slowly dressing himself. He would not go to St. Bevins yet; this news had altered his programme. He could not have Moreton eyes looking upon his secret, which he thought must be patent to all. The second day of Allan's absence found him entering upon his painful task; and forgetting all but that, as he looked at the stately woman before him, and heard a voice so like Allan's, saying:   IN A CRUCIBLE.         225 "You are my son's friend, Mr. Moreton, I presume," glancing at the card she held; "and are very welcome, as I need hardly assure you." There was an old-fashioned formality in her manner, and a dignified unconsciousness of any possible disgrace which could attach to "my soni" that rendered Arthur's task an exceedingly difficult one. "You left my son quite well?" she said, after a moment's pause. "Qui;te well, bodily," said Arthur, slowly. "But Allan was in some trouble, Mrs. Fenwick, and got me to see you for him." "My son in trouble, and solicit another to intercede with his mother?" said the stately voice. "There must be some mistake, Mr. Moreton. My son could never have done any- thing that needed the intercession of a third party between himself and me." Arthur saw the quiver of a proud, sensitive lip, despite the slow, dignified speech. It was but a poor counterfeit to conceal the pang of a great pain, which called all her proud old blood to her aid, "Who are you," it seemed to say, "that come to me with a tale of my boy's shame?" "My dear madam," said Arthur, " will you first recall to mind that I am Allan's best friend; and that I have come by his request on a very painful errand: will you promise to extend me your forgiveness for any wound I may inflict, and permit me to speak?" "You are quite at liberty to speak, Mr. Moreton, quite at liberty," she said, sharply; " and if I am to be wounded at all, as well by you as another: but if it is by your advice that my son has selected you as a mediator between himself and me, allow me to say it was needless, worse than needless. I shall never believe any tale of Allan's shame that does not come from Allan himself." 10 *   226         IN A CRUCIBLE. It was the dignified utterance of a dethroned monarch, un- willing to make an admission of the fact; and when it was finished she drew herself up, with the rich old blood of her Virginia ancestry dyeing her handsome face - handsome still, though- seventy summers had blanched white the smooth tresses that lay on her brow. ' My Allan a culprit ! " she continued. " Look into that face, Mr. Moreton, and then into mine, and tell me to believe it; or say that you do." She rose, settled the folds of her rich silk, and the lace ruffles in her sleeves, and, tapping her gold snuff-box with an imperious gesture, repeated her question. The face she alluded to was a portrait taken of Allan when a mere boy. He was dressed in a green hunting-suit, the collar thrown widely open at the throat; his hand laid, with imperious hold, upon the neck of a shaggy water-dog; the head thrown back, and a smile of defiant, mocking mischief enthroning the fair face and laughing lips. Truth and candor flashed upon the beholder from a pair of bright, blue eyes; and a brow pure, fair, and noble as the one that Was turned impatiently upon him. He contrasted it with the pale, hag- gard face that had bent over his pillow when they parted but a day or two before, and sighed. Keenly the mother had watched him as he turned in obe- dience to her gesture to look upon the portrait; and when that breath struggled through his lips, her own, paled to a deathly white. "He can do nothing ungentlemanly; he has the best blood of Louisiana and Virginia in his veins, and has been too well raised for it, Mr. Moreton. If there was nothing else to restrain him, this would be sufficient; but you forget that he is a minister of God -that my fatherless boy went forth on his mission with his widowed mother's blessing and her prayers," she said, with a last effort at repudiation.    IN A CRUCIBLE.         227 "My dear lady," said Arthur, gently; "will you permit me to speak? You -are needlessly prolonging a very painful scene. Your son has done nothing that a worldly mother would not readily forgive; but which, I know, as a Christian woman, you will not think less culpable than crime." Then he went through his story, not looking into the stern, pained face; but with his eyes bent on the floor, and in a gentle, compassionate voice. "You are quite right, Mr. Moreton," she said, when he ceased, " in saying that I should look upon such a deed as a crime. I am a very proud old woman, Mr. Moreton,"-here her voice trembled slightly; " but I am also, I trust, a Chris- tian woman; and I had sooner have taken this illiterate girl by the hand as my son's wife, than know her the vile crea- ture she must be - than know her an outcast among her own sex, and a legitimate object of vicious pursuit to the other." Here, she extended a very fair, slender, aristocratic hand to Arthur, continuing, in a measured voice: "But I cannot forsake him, Mr. Moreton. Guilty though he be, he is my child, and a mother's heart knows forgiveness for every crime. You will tell him so; and tell him also," she added, with that little formal emphasis that at any other time would have made Arthur smile -"You may tell him, also, that it ill became him to send any one to intercede for him: what I could not forgive for his dear sake, I would not be likely to do at your intercession." "It was only his desire to avoid witnessing your distress," began Arthur; but she interrupted him with a wave of her hand, saying, stiffly: "He should have come himself: his mother's mortification would have been sacred in his eyes. Yet I am not forgetting that you are his best friend," she added, with an effort at being gracious, in which she but ill succeeded. To be the bearer of ill tidings is but a thankless office at all times.   228         IN A CRUCIBLE. She remained standing; and Arthur, bowing over the hand she extended, went down the stairs. True to her feigned stoicism, she waited, like a queen dis- missing an unwelcome messager, until the door closed upon him; then covered her gray hairs with two trembling hands, and cried, with- the stricken Hebrew: "  Oh! my son, my son!"  God had smitten her in her pride, and written Ichabod on the pillars of that house.   CHAPTER XXIV. A RAILWAY EPISODE. "But standing apart, as she ever had done, And her genius, which needed a vent, finding none In the broad fields of action thrown wide to man's power, She unconsciously made it her bulwark and tower, And built in it her refuge, whence lightly she hurled Her contempt at the fashions and forms of the world. And indeed her chief fault was this unconscious scorn Of the world, to whose usages woman is born. Not the world when that word implies all human nature, The Creator's great gift to the needs of the creature; But the world, with encroachments that chafe and perplex, With its men against men, and its sex against sex. ' Ah, what will the world say? ' with her was a query Never uttered, or uttered alone with a dreary Rejection in thought of the answer before It was heard. ..........   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . She tried With the weak hand of woman to thrust it aside; And it stung her. A wonman is too slight a thing To trample the world withoutfeeling its sting." Lucille. WHLE the gray dawn was still struggling in the clasp of night, Parolet grew wearied of her vigil, and returned to the buildings.  A lamp burned feebly at Reginald's side, and he was sleeping heavily. With a sudden impulse which she made no pause to question, she knelt beside him, looking long and earnestly into the sleeping face. Was it unveiled by slumber?     As she looked, a deep sense of the beauty of the countenance impressed itself upon her; a beauty -greater than strict chiselling of feature: a sense of strength        and power, worshipped by the ancients, who deified Idea. Manly strength, calmness, cool courage!      What a power of fate lay in this man's hands over the destiny, the very life of one, 229   230         IN A CRUCIBLE. should he seek its control I She had studied faces and char- acters, with as keen an eye, as deep a comprehension as this man had, and with an intuition far keener. Man is generally moulded and influenced by his surroundings. His suscepti- bility is less; and that broad basis of common sense which, in him, is mental strength, sturdily resists the inroads of imagination and fancy. In woman, greater susceptibility en- ables her to grasp at possibilities which lie beyond the reach of personal experience, or requirements. There is -a vague hunger of the soul which will, by its persistent force, conceive the existence of a higher, wider plan of life than her own; and which will force itself upon her independently of any outside influence derivable from books, or the more refining medium of society. Circumstance and restricted observation, while it affected man, did not, in woman's narrower range, equally tame and subdue. With her there is a fine mental vision, a keen perception, a wider range of feeling, which enables her to take her natural position in scenes foreign to the habits of circumstance and education: which, often lead- ing ,to lamentable consequences, yet renders her superior to man in that increased power of her nature for sympathy and tenderness. Man, living in a world of realities, with constant calls upon his mental resources for the commonest duties of professional or political life, leaves to woman the world of thought, which, far greater and wider than that of action, and incapable of suppression, overflows in all the emotional part of her nature. She was pleased .and pained at her scrutiny, and remained for a few moments absorbed in a strange, half-frightened fixedness; then rose, and moving silently to the door, stood looking out at the prospect. Her mind was disturbed and unsettled. That bearded face, with its calm- serenity, filled her mind's eye like the stone head of a Medusa: something beautiful, yet terrible, because it held a destiny. She shivered,   IN A CRUCIBLE.         2381 involuntarily, striving to banish such thoughts: not her des- tiny, at any rate, lay in its control. She was becoming weak and unnerved by solitude and suffering, or such fancies would never have found entrance. Again and again her eyes turned that way, with a restless impatience of the heavy, motionless slumber. Not a muscle moved. The maimed arm lay carelessly over the broad chest heaving with deep, regular, hot breaths: she almost felt how hot they were, and wondered whether the fever-flush had crept into the eyes that lay veiled from her sight. What power would leap to life there warmed by passion! what fascinating terror! The statue was perfect, wanting but the. hot breath of passion to become godlike! Once more she crept to his side, and feasted her soul with its beauty; a long gaze, with hard-drawn breath, and eyes seeking enlightenment. Here. was perfect manhood--an Adam--in a world of which she knew nothing, yet which might be-? A chaos of thought bewildered her; her countenance darkened with a shade of deep sadness. She could comprehend so little. Her thirsty lips sought knowl- edge -of God and -man! Woman was but a reflex of the Adam. These were not thoughts that would have suggested them- selves to one who had passed her life in the calm of polite society: they were those of a woman who had lived in soli- tude, where thought had been a revelation of nature-who had studied humanity in its rare, exceptional glimpses, and who had read and interpreted it under this revelation of natural thought. Man had been a marvel to her; a fasci- nating marvel: presenting thought, speech, and action always in a light adverse to her own. She held no key to such study in herself; she was the poor shadow; and her womanly per- ceptions only stood between herself and the sun, when she sought the light it threw upon the nature of man. With a   232         IN A CRUCIBLE. sense of the power that lay in this man - the power of mind, body, and will-she marvelled at his calm; a calm, irri. tating yet attractive, and full of terror. She had never before felt such a sense of her own weakness. Was that calm never brokenh? Never? In the heat and dust of battle, or when he buffeted the waves for a life? Passionless alwaysl with the strong tide of sweet and bitter emotion stirring within him? with the hot thirst for life's goals swelling in his veins? She remembered Trevor's narrative; and this was power-manly power. The eager, trembling clasp of a woman's hand was--failure: the grasp of man's hot pur- suits wrought- success! Wide fields were open to him where the feet might grow weary, but the eye was undimmed to the end. For him, was the pant of expectation and hope: for her, disappointment and unavailing greed! Human nature was a marvel of far greater interest to her than the mythical lore of books. Man she could read, only by intuition: what sympathy had she with this creature, so like, yet so unlike? To her fancy, there was beauty in the giant-world of Scan- dinavian mythology; clothing ideas of strength, power, and beauty in the glory of manhood. Tow man,- woman must render homage; and this was sweet and easy, if she loved: failing that, it was cruel and bitter. Fate had crushed her down, and humbled her; pride was a paltry thing in her, making a mock and a derision of her highest powers. What could she know of what best befitted woman? Her soul had sickened and withered under the hot clasp of passion without love. Like Tantalus, the draught of a pure affection had fled her thirsty lips. A dejected Andromeda, wearied with the slow passage of waiting Time, she shook her chains de- fiantly sometimes. She had believed, once, that the wing of a strong, pure love would lift her chain-fettered heart, and cleanse the cankered rust of the soul; but her patient eyes, lifted over the desolate sea, had grown dim with the -salt   IN A CRUCIBLE.         233 spray, and the shadow on her life was not the wing of Perseus! The first sweet promise of freedom was growing faint. She had read, in that long look-a promise; and while nature burst into exuberant life around her, she felt the full tide of her youth and strength; only to feel the greater force of that rude barrier that fate had thrust between herself and happiness. God was far from her then; and the teeming pulse of nature woke a brooding defiance on her sullen face. She was wrong, assuredly! for truth was pow- erful with her still; but fate had crushed her out of the right path when it set a stained idol in a shrine that should have been dedicated to'a pure love, and the pollution of a forced worship must beat high resolve in the dust. Why had she been denied the sweet, softening influences of love and happiness? She was in no mood now to hearken to the voice whispering "that from the yellow dust of conflict, a soul might rise to God higher than man, and perfect!" "Madame is interested in the face of Monsieur Moreton." Parolet started. Their strange travelling companion sat on a fallen log in front of the building, composedly puffing huge volumes of smoke from under his mustache. His short, stout person was enveloped in the folds of his roquelaure, and a foraging-cap sat carelessly on a shock of rough, uncombed hair. The eyes were expressive-- twinkling with malicious meaning, or full of a cool, sardonic significance, extremely unpleasant if addressed to yourself. The brown, heavily bearded face was full of nonchalant effrontery; and Parolet Trevor's hasty blood flushed at the implied insolence. "In the study of faces," she returned, coolly. "Ah! I am not averse to that amusement, myself," he re- turned, changing his position so as to lounge indolently on his elbow. "I have been much interested in that of Madame Trefor.' He had made himself well acquainted with their names. Parolet bit her lip. P.    234         IN A CRUCIBLE. "One must study such a face like that," pointing with his pipe in the direction of Reginald, "with very keen eyes, to discover the character: madame's is more transparent." She deigned no reply. "Madame is not interested, perhaps? It is possible women do not admire what the men find most admirable. Inf that face one would say there was pride, courage, generosity--?'" he hesitated on the word: there was no answer from the proud, sensitive lips he questioned, and he resumed -" cool- ness, and effrontery! None of the soft virtues lesfemmes ad- mire. A woman would distrust him--a man would walk up to him and say, ' I make you my friend; I put my honor in your hand;' and he would guard it like a knight, as his lips guard his heart." There was the peculiar flutter of the lips that presaged speech, and she burst forth: "One who talks so well, should act well. There is a wide field in the South now: have you staked any of the noble attributes you ascribe to your friend " The sullen pallor rolled away like morning mist, and a hot flush kindled -on her cheek. The Frenchman's eyes softened into admiration. He raised off his elbow, and with a quick motion displaced his cloak, exposing, for an instant, his brawny, hirsute chest, where, vest and shirt-front torn away, an ugly, crimson seam disclosed itself, extending diagonally from shoulder to rib. In an instant he replaced the covering, and composedly uttered the one word - C" hickamauga." After a momentary struggle, Parolet said, hastily: "Pray, pray forgive me. Will the brave foreigner who wears the badge of my country's honor, take the hand of a Southern woman as an earnest of her high and grateful esteem?" But a moment before, she was hating him cordially-was longing to chastise his insolent familiarity; now, she was fullD of eagerness, and the hand she extended trembled as it lay in his clasp.        k   IN A ORUCIBLE.        235 He was quite composed, and after the rendering of their little compact, fell back into his old lounging attitude. "A very troublesome badge of your country's honor; but worth that little dash of your enthusiasm. Madame is en- thusiastic," he said, emphatically; "and a woman's enthu- siasm is contagious: witness that little Louisiana episode." "What do you mean?" she said, flushing under a very meaning glance. He seemed in no great hurry to reply. He took his pipe from his mouth, and smiled: "Oh! of course you know nothing about it; only a small affair: a company laying down their arms, with their captain frantic, and, pistol in hand, endeavoring to drive les canailles on board the steamer.' Quite useless! the enemy were afford- ing a convenient refuge close by, and messieurs les soldats shall march no farther in search of la gloire. Behold them, banded together, and making a determined front against monsieur le capitaine, when lol they are met by a very pretty, very in- dignant speech from a very enthusiastic, patriotic, Southern woman, who brings their disloyal blood up to fever-heat, arms them with shot-guns and muskets, minus locks and flints, and away goes monsieur le capitaine victorious. Do I know you now?" he questioned, mischievously. She laughed, and blushed; not relishing this reminder of an escapade of which she had been just a little ashamed when her enthusiasm subsided. "Where were you?" she questioned. "On board the steamer, watching the issue of the contest: not hard to guess the result, with beauty, eloquence, patriot- ism, and-liquor, in madame's favor. Now permit me to introduce myself a little more formally. I am Philomel Bujac, at your service; at present a private in the Confederate ranks, with the distant hope of promotion to a rank more fitting his extraordinary merits; and now full of a very   236-         IN A CRUCIBLE. laudable intention to be transferred, at as early a period as possible, to the command of that Capitaine, Colonel, General - whatever it may be - Moreton." Parolet smiled, and shook her head. "You are all wrong. He is a private, like yourself." Monsieur Philomel Bujac stared incredulously. "Pas possible! That man a private! Ah! a great appre- ciation les Amtericaines have of soldierly merit! Under Na- poleon that soldier would have stepped out of the ranks after the first battle. Pas possible! c'est un f. f. of some State, eh?" "Of Louisiana," she returned, smiling; "wealthy, noble, aristocrate, in the true sense of the word. Ah, Mr. Bujac, here is the true greatness and glory of the Southern army: do you understand?"   "Noble, wealthy, aristocrate: that means altogether power- ful. Oui, je comprends; something in the way which we frangcaise are not moche troubled with - modesty! Merit in him; but not moche merit to the government. Proud! Ah! j'aime cela!" For some moments he smoked away in silence, curled up on the log, with his short arms clasping his knees. She was beginning to like this rude, brave, impertinent foreigner, with the gash of a cavalry sabre on his breast, and the seared scar of a redhot bullet on his cheek. Enthusiasm was con- tagious; and she could have touched those ugly scars very reverently with her lips. "Come, I will tell you more of this Mr. Moreton," she began. The face of Monsieur Philomel grew sardonic: "Then madame is interested in Monsieur Moreton." "In all Southern soldiers," she said, impatiently. "Will you listen?" "If madame pleases to relate," he returned submissively, settling himself so as to look at her with more ease. Rapidly   IN A CRUCIBLE.         237 she rehearsed the soldier-life of Reginald Moreton, as she had heard it from her husband; with a few-touches of womanly enthusiasm, such as kindled' the warmth in all Southern women's eyes when they offered Idumian apples to the deeds of history: that history that is written in our hearts, and that, now that the lips are mute, grows sacred, in silence! "Mr. Bujac listened intently, shifted his position, and paced up and down in front of her, as the story progressed. It was a delightful little story, embellished by this woman's lips: an epigram full of terseness and vigor; yet, when it was brought to a close, Monsieur Philomel said not one word, but sat quietly down on the log, and resumed his smoking. "These women are so enthusiastic," he said, sententiously; "the men are always heroes, or- devils! I suppose Mr. Moreton is a little of the nature of both?" "Possibly," returned Parolet, shortly. She had been a little damped at the Aception of her story. She had not been thinking of the subject of her eulogy. He was the type of the Southern soldier: that type that had all her heart-worship and her hero-worship. Mr. Philome1l was busy studying another face, propped on an elbow, flushed with fever, which had also been listening to this epigrammatic delivery; but he did not hear the lips mutter: "This is a woman's revenge! what a noble creature she-or what a paltry one I!" Parolet had her back to part of her audience, and was facing only Mr. Bujac. He resumed: "It is possible to admire soche men; but not to love: a little force and tenderness would be better. Well, who can say if it is not better as it is. Should the sword devour them, the ladies would not mourn lovers and husbands: they would sing funeral hymns to les htros." "I am not sure of that; women like three things in a man: truth, courage, and generosity! We overlook trifles in them;   238         IN A CRUCIBLE. these belong to women. When a man marries, he looks to see if a woman puts her needle into the cloth awkwardly or well; and he is right. It is a trifle, and her life is made up of them: these she must be able to do well. We forgive more in a man, and we exact less; probably because we ex- pect less." "He may even be a little wicked?" suggested her auditor, dryly. She fell into the trap. "Yes; I think he may: that is, a man's wickedness is generally greater than a woman's, just as his virtues are; and we cannot measure to them contempt. A woman can love anything she does not despise." "C'est a dire; the great Shakspeare was not far wrong when he made Richard rush, in hot haste from the murdered husband, to press his suit upon the wife?" The insolence of his satire forced itself upon her. She turned her head witif that swift movement over the shoulder, and looked at Reginald. His eyes were open, and fixed upon her. Mr. Philomel spoke again: "M. Moreton's wound is severe, and the consequences of delay fatal to Madame Trefor." Parolet flushed with passion. Reginald rose with difficulty and came to her side. "M. Bujac, you have insulted me through this lady. I never accept apologies for intentional insult to myself, or to my friends." This formal speech, slowly uttered, ended, and Reginald's left arm shot out from his shoulder, sending the philosophical Frenchman prostrate over the log. Before he could rise, the train was in sight. To Reginald's extreme amazement, he gathered himself up, bowed low, and said: "Pray consider that blow in the light of an ample apology. When next we meet, it will be hand to hand, fighting a com- mon enemy. My spirit of irony mastered the deep respect in   IN A COtUCIBLE.        239 which I hold Madame Trefor. Will you permit me to hold for an instant your disabled hand? Fortunately you struck me with your left, or I could never have proffered this token of amity to a brave comrade in arms." The whole affair had taken a turn that savored too much of melodrama to be altogether agreeable to Reginald. He bowed in haughty silence, handed Parolet into the car,-and followed her, without a word to Monsieur Philomel Bujac, who retained his own composure unruffled to the end. He sprang on the car wheel, thrust his head into the window where Parolet sat, and said: "My badge of honor sustains my reputation in your eyes, does it not?" She shrank from him in absolute terror. He had pained and mortified her, and the hot tears rushed to her eyes as she hastily lowered her veil. True, she had, for the moment, forgotten her husband's illness, but he had taken the most in- sulting method of reminding her of it. His words had pro- bably, too, forced Reginald to resume their journey when he was suffering from their disaster. Then she began to reflect, with dismay, that it was possible Reginald might have heard her eulogy on himself, and misconstrued it; but she was not a woman to disquiet herself long with what others 'might think when she held herself blameless, and her tribute had been paid only through him to that large mass he so truth- fully represented, and to her ideas of the abstract qualities that were embodied in him. Shelooked into the face before her, and felt that it was one she could trust to do her strict justice. He was evidently displeased, she thought as she looked at the pale, severe face that studiously avoided her own. What had possessed her to stand parleying with a stranger - a foreigner-in a railway dp6t! Crimsoning with mortification, she leaned forward, and bent a pair of anxious eyes upon him, saying:   21,0         IN A CRUCIBLE. "'You are angry with me, Mr. Moreton; I am very sorry. Will you forgive me? I cannot think what came over me." "I am not angry with you," he said, coldly; "I have- no right to be: I am simply your escort, not your adviser." She shrank back, pained at his rebuff; but she was not angry with him: she only resolved to be more particular in future, and not merit his disapproval. Soon her mind was filled with different ideas: the terror lest she might find her husband dead! Her thousand little faults and short-comings toward him rose up in array, and she began to crave his for- giveness : only that before he went from her, and her life could flow like some deep river, broad and full, out to the sea.  S-F   CHAPTER XXV. rNQeI SEATTON. ;.....  .. . . "For some, unerring, The soul's white lilies keep their virgin hue; Some who, when thoughts so danger-sweet are stirring, Take the stern strength that Nature gives the few I Then, bravely bear this life, ye millions- Bear this for that beyond the sod, Assured that o'er the star-pavilions Reward awaits, with God." Schiller. THERE is an abyss in the wide world of thought, over which the soul broods wordless. A dead sea of memory, and pre- sent thought, full of pollution, yet through which, having once trodden, we turn with 'oft eager step, bending, that our lips lose not the taste of its passionate pain: not feeling that from each dip into that bitter whirlpool, we rise with the taint deep-crusted, and with supple withes grown to banded iron. Like Rizpah, we cling to o0rr rock, though it hold only loathsomeness.   Perhaps, after a long season, the rain falls, and we leave the rock of cherished sin, and go on our way. Then the dead sea vanishes, with its ghastly remembrances, and the phantom form is strangled. The bitter taste of the salt waves may never leave our lips; but it is a strong savor of remembrance, and speeds the fleeing feet. Yet this rain must be the veritable torrent that ushers in the harvest. All through  that season of waiting with dead hopes, the dews have fallen, and the sun shone around us; but the soul has not heeded. It has known but the one pang of its utter desolation!   Not undeserved, mayhap, but exceeding bitter. Yet, while it fell, even while we clung,'the dew  and the sun "          241   242         IN A CRUCIBLE. ripened a nearly forgotten spring-time of youth and training; and when that gush of bitter waters has fallen, the soul lifts up itself, and returns a full yield. Yet these are processes of the mind, of which the world takes no reckoning. The forms we see, and that are not always quenched in the waves of resolution, are spectral illu- sions. Only, wide openings in the world of nature yawn, sometimes, on our startled vision, and disclose a Rizpah, cling- ing in desolation to her rock-to the unresting desire for those human gods that have been wrenched from her. Ac- tion moves forward with shodden feet, and form of light, into the upward places where the strong voices beckon and com- mand. Supple to the bonds of social life, the deed obeys-- the thought avenges itself! Grim, defiant, hideous, and. re- volting, it rears its Titan form, nor do we turn from it. It is ours-a giant offspring which we have brought forth and nourished -before which we shiver, yet grow proud. Should this monster threaten ourselves, we grow defiant: "I who gave thee birth, can crush; " yet, realizing that this creature of thought may lead to what will cast a blight through us upon another, we gird up our loins, and wrestle withl terror and strength, as did the grim father in the clasp of the Laocoon, for the life of his offspring. Comrades! shall we loathe one another, learning this? Shall we scorn her be- hests, when Truth, with finger on lip, stays us, amid the hurry of rushing feet, bidding us pause in desolate places and read? It is a handwriting on the wall! Curb impatience, and read - pityingly! Perchance to thy heart shall come but a whis- per-Tekel. Yet, at that word the waves of self-righteous- ness may ebb, and thy heart take up the answering word, which that vision hath made plain: then, on submissive lips the Mene lingers. The dust-begrimed spirit has battled in darkness and ,storm, while your feetshave trod in pleasant places. No comrn   IN A CRUCIBLE.          243 manding form of action has said, "Rise up, suffer, aid do!" The conflict of restless feet has swept unheeding by; the icy hand of fate has fettered the eager pulse, and crushed the bounding will. Beaten down in shadowy places, it has seen glad forms go by, hurrying on to broad fields of life, while the spirit muttered; longing to " go out among the forms it looked at, in among the throngs of men;" forced to face thought until its form, distorted, grew into the very life of the being, making a mock of all holiness and purity here; giving to wild love and passionate longing the guerdon of its be- hests, until both are laid in the dust of unavailing regret, or unending sleep. Sometimes the spirit's torch is relit here, and we render to the senseless dust a meed withheld from the struggling spirit. Death only is passionless; yet all things passionless are not pure; nor all things passionate unholy! Ofttimes on the faces of the dead, God has written his Mene, mene, in characters which we dare not question; though we scoffed, before that quenchless spark "returned to the gods from whom 'twas stolen." Over this black and bitter whirlpool of thought, Parolet Trevor hung enamored. She knew her idol stained, yet would not hurl it down. Through those intervening hours where, behind the Marah of thought, hung apples of forbid- den fruit, and where, beyond the restless desire of the future, Death stood mute, lay a chasm of unbridled -fancy! Steeped to the lips in vast longings for impossible things, she ceased to remember that the fruit she clutched would turn to ashes in her grasp - apples of Sodom, rotten at the core, dust and ashes. To her fancy they were the golden fruit ofHsperides: she was an unsexed Hercules, who would seizetlb fruit yclept happiness, in the jaws of the dragon Fate! - Cruelland relent- less it had been, but she would free' herself -frmn its grasp. A wide field of possibilities opened before her. The vision dazzled and enchanted. Peopled with a world of images, she   244     -   IN A CRUCIBLE. saw commanding forms of ambition and noble aspiration;, these had erewhile filled her mind's eye: now, beside them, sprang meaner forms of personal gain, and lust of pleasure, which she made no effort to banish. The golden river was Life, and she would launch her bark with the pleasure-seekers. The dream-land of voluptuous languor and indolent indulgence need not quench her spirit, for the flood-tides were strong and wholesome. True, Death stood at the threshold of her dreams, and-only menaced! He stood mute, making no promise for the life that lay beyond; yet her eyes were blinded and dazzled, and she ceased to remember -that at the approach of her hot lips that flood-tide had ever rolled away as at the breath of Tantalus! Hope and desire were strong within her. The weary years had fled. Then, she had gone down into the vat, and trodden the wine-presses with resolute feet; now the sun of sweet promise arose for her, as for others; the fumes of that seething vat rose up in intoxicating perfume. The inflexible voice that whispered of delusion and madness was drowned; and in revenge, heaped high the goblet which her thirsty lips sought, that one day she might drink it to the lees of a deep and bitter disappointment. Conscience was to become the avenger; but now, she veiled her face, and the riot of the soul was unquelled. There are souls so steeped in the delirium of emotion that pain, pleasure, and expectation die in sensation; where action would pale and wither ere conception was matched, and re- tribution comes in scorn and self-loathing: a satiety born of the senses only, yet than which nothing can be more weari- some- more intense! And so it was with Parolet. Ere their destination was reached the hungry spirit had feasted, and was full: it could, or would no more! It was ready to relinquish all promise, that the plague-spot of quenchless de- sire might be removed; and sickened that this might be, only when life ended! No torrent of hot tears could relieve the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         245 spirit's dearth; it craved wider and deeper gifts of life; it struggled with the bonds of the flesh; yet victory was too often won through the satiety of mental indulgence. Languid motions and haggard traces betrayed the conflict to Regi- nald's eye, as he handed her from the car. He, too, had been busy with his thoughts; he, too, had given the reins to his imagination; but the riot of fancy had wrought nothing against the passive force of his, nature. The finer material of the woman bore its traces in the dark-circled eyes, and he noted the trembling of the hand that lay on his arm as they threaded the staircase; and for an instant, at the doorway, she paused. Weary and dejected as the face was, with sensitive lips quivering with emotion, and a pallor touching as the desola- tion in her eyes, he restrained the demonstration of a pity that might -have unnerved. Giving her an instant - only an instant.-in which to regain -her composure, he opened the door, and urged her forward with a firm, resistless force, that he knew so well how to exercise. The gaunt form stretched-on a low pallet was her husband; with death on the wasted features and dull eyes, that bright- ened as they rested upon her. With a low moan, a quiver of remorseful tenderness, she sprang to the outstretched arms, and laid her cheek to his. There was dearth of tears, or speech. The life that flickered so feebly, was rousing itself for one effort! The words that trembled for utterance seethed through her brain, and hushed the moan on her lips. The phantom of wrong, deceit, and treachery rose mockingly be- side that bed of death, and before it memory too rose vivid, and corroborated. Doubt fled before the bitter iron of truth: it entered her quivering spirit, and rendered ruthless by its wrongs I The bondage of years upon spirit and flesh avenged itself here! The seal was removed - the hot clasp of revenge and hatred, even the cold finger of death had no power then   246        IN A CRUCIBLE, to chill. Long after the solemn presence had settled amid the silence, the iron pressure on her brow was madness, the passionate cry of disdain and contemptuous hatred quivered in the pulsing throat. "Parolet," he had said, "Parolet, my wife, can you for- give me? I am dying; but I cannot die in peace unless you promise to do what you can to redeem the wrong I have in- flicted." Then he told the story of his treachery to her, his betrayal of another: told it with faltering lips, and with his dying eyes full of a courage that could have come only to the dying. "And you will right that poor child," he said. "( You will provide for her out of my means. They are ample for both. I would not defraud you, but it seems only just ,that she should not want." He was thinking of his mistress: not of her - the wife-- a wife of eight long years of servitude and endurance; but of the golden-haired child- the toy of an hour! "I promise," she said, hoarsely; "if you left but a pit- tance, she should have compensation." "Thank you," he said, faintly; " you have given me great relief; it has taken a load off my conscience. It was very wrong," he muttered: "God forgive me! she was such a very child; but this will keep her out of harm's way, and it is all I can do." Then he turned his- eyes with slow, painful effort upon Parolet, and, for the first time, a quiver of remorse shot over the bronzed face. Two tears-silent tears-as a man's mostly are, gathered tremblingly, and rolled over the gaunt cheeks. He put out his hand deprecatingly. "Can you forgive me, wife? I am not worthy--I am dying--you will forget it--you will think kindly of me? You were always a good wife, and I was proud and fond of you," he said, wistfully.   IN A CRUCIBLE.        247 "I know you never loved me; but I knew it when your father gave you to me." He paused, and Parolet raised her stricken face to his- pale, stern, reproachful as Hypatia's when the gaunt Hermit struck her! All remorse, or tenderness, or compassion had died out of it, and she said slowly: "Yes; I was a good wife: a true and faithful one. I never deceived, or fawned, or flattered; but I did my duty. God help me! I had nothing left me but to marry you, being so young, so ignorant, so helpless! I have travelled night and day to come to you, dying, that I might carry the remembrance of your love and kindness through a future else a blank - to lay a last kiss on your lips - to obtain your forgiveness for any hasty word that might have pained you; and I learn that you have deceived me! Do you think a wife ever forgives that?" Again, as the' near presence of death made itself felt, he opened his eyes, fixed them with effort upon her, and mur- mured, feebly: "Will you forgive me, Parolet? only one word of forgiveness." It was a hungering, piteous appeal, from the lips of a dying man; but the truth was too innate in her. She could not tell a lie. There was no forgiveness in her heart, and there was none on her white lips. Words he could not have heard, had she 'uttered them; but he had watched those lips, how eagerly! and a slight shiver passed over his frame as the light of ex- pectation died out of his eyes. A flood of warm sunlight lay over the land; and- at the open window stood Parolet, with- knitted brow and folded lips, watching the slumberous noon. Its heavy pulses, fet- tered with the heat, beat drowsily; its full life lay numbed in torpor; and her life with its swelling veins lay bound and fettered with iron bands: bands, not forged by man, but reaching from that world of shadows, vague and terrible, that   248         IN A CRUCIBLE. was a constant menace! And now, the restricting obliga- tion of human will was laid upon her. Was it marvel that the lips open with the cry, "My burden is greater than I can bear!"Yet she did bear it: not only that bitter burden of an intolerable necessity, when her stern spirit of justice lifted itself to admit the demand; but the withes bound by a will mightier than man's. She was a woman; with no eye to look upon her distress--no ear to chronicle the promise she had made: yet she suffered the one in silence, and kept the other in the letter and the spirit, when thAt first madness of passion died away. Her changed mood did not escape Reginald when he en- tered to take charge of the dead and lead her from the room; but he had no suspicion of that death-bed revelation that had frozen the deep current of womanly emotion, when it laid upon her the obligations of a man, and demanded his cool courage for her acts. He was far from her thoughts; nor did he seek to intrude upon them in the few days that inter- vened before they turned their faces homeward. To Parolet, that backward journey was taken with far different thoughts. No visions peopled her brain. Thought remained a blank: a dreary chasm, over which the unnumbered years stretched void of hope; and before whose darkness the light of God and nature seemed quenched forever! e,   CHAPTER XXVL BITTER-SWEET. "Of the poor, proud, sad spirit, rejecting love's wages, Yet working love's work; reading backward life's pages For penance; and stubbornly, many a time, Both missing the moral, and marring the rhyme." Owen Meredith. IN silence and solitude, the days of that homeward journey rose and fell.- And   it was well! The harrowing incubus was no rugged thing that a ruthless hand might seize and conquer; fitful, impalpable, born out of silence, nursed in solitude--a thing for the soul to wrestle with--a Moloch, which the spirit must quench in the blood of sacrifice! There were days when the lips lay locked behind veiled folds-- nights when the kindly screen was thrust aside, that night- dews and purpling mists and still voices might do their work: when the loving watches set overhead shed their own holy balm, dew-distilled, into the aching heart: "Large, loving, languid, the stars here and there, Like the eyes of shy, passionate women, look'd down." Did the spirit rise at their bidding?   To nature's children, her voices are potent! Her work is wrought silently and surely; her curb the fiery spirit owns. Cease exordium! Exact nothing! Leave the heart and the unfettered spirit to the sole influence to which  it can, or will respond.  The hot-house breath of conventional life, training to tropical splendor, is no  health-giving principle: one drop of nature blesses the life of the plant and sweetens its essence! After deep and brief conflict, the flexible spirit rose, from its attitude of suppliance and defiance. The fever-heat of " *   ,     249  ,     /   250         IN A CRUCIBLE. resistless will died at the touch of Ithuriel's spear: truth was at its barb, and a drop of the dew of content trickled down the shaft, and entered the gaping wound. The rugged bark of truth she had torn from the tree of life, and thrust it to her heart unflinchingly- though the flesh might quiver and the cheek redden. She sought it now, patiently, and humbly. She rendered up scrupulous tithe, and demanded restitution of her better nature. It had gone down in those bitter waters self-thrust; but they were waters of Meribah, flowing forth at rebellious murmurs-God-stricken -and Truth lurked at the bottom, and had not hidden her reproving face while she gazed. She did not believe that this better nature had been wrested from her ruthlessly, though she had brought the offering in her hand; nor did she doubt its restitution, now that she asked it back. Her faith was simple, and far-reach- ing as the stars she studied: she knew nothing of them, yet she believed in them; and their vastness and glory and beauty were a reflex, dim and subsident, of the Godl who made them. His vastness was far above the petty passions of humanity. Once, and often, she had turned from that Marah of the soul, patient,'hopeful, and expectant. This was the hardihood of her nature, and its religion. She had held narrower views once: beliefs in, the social life around her; in even-handed justice that waited at its shrines, and meted praise and reward. It was-a warm, loving, generous belief; offered in the plentitude of a rich nature: a-nature full of high impulses, and with some undue pride in its large gifts-- gifts that were to warm, cheer, comfort- while the life-giving arteries refilled her own veins with the tide of a larger exist- ence. They were the fantasies of youth: belief was crushed in its first budding: the promised fruitage withheld, while grasping greed drained dry the generous draught she prof- -fered. She knew them but for " social lies that warp us from the living truth." She spurned and trampled, in her young,   IN. A CRUCIBLE.        261 passionate disdain, on the simple gauds that had cheated her fancy. She wrapped herself in reserve, and her six and twenty years of womanhood avenged the baffled promise of her youth; yet, through all, she had kept untarnished one god of that earlier day. She caressed and' paid homage to this plain, uncomely image; and resolved that her life should owe no- thing to falsehood. He who ran might read, and reading, might hate; but not despise! Truth sat on the folded lips: truth challenged you out of the depths of fringed eyes; and sat dauntless on the brow. Even-handed justice was a mockery and a cheat, and threw false coin of social life to turn the balance; and she ceased to demand it. -But she had not ceased to care for all these things, or to mourn the losses of that buoyant spring-season, whose golden fruitage had been withheld. Her pride and pain were great, but she concealed both, and after a season she learned to relinquish one by one the idols of hope. Nature did her healing work, but she exacted tithe, and the ashen cheek and sunken eye, the dry quiver of the throat did not escape the vigilant watchfulness of one who, from her censor, had become her protector. A firm, kindly protection it was, if undemon- strative. "You are ill," he said, bending toward, her. "You need rest, and must have it. We will stop here until you are better." "Yes," she said, faintly, putting her hand to her head. "I-feel very ill, and this noise and motion is killing me." "You can get but poor accommodation here," he returned; "but you may at least obtain rest; and we can resume our journey when you are more able to endure the fatigue." She had not exaggerated in saying that she was very ill; and when the train with its noise and smoke and bustle steamed on, leaving her standing under a quiet sky with her companion, the twinkle of light from that lonely laborer's   252         IN A CAUCIBLE. humble cottage seemed a beacon of rest and peace. With throbbing brain and quivering nerves she laid her head on the coarse but cleanly pillow, and then came a sense of deep quiet, of great comfort, and a long void where consciousness became but a faint sense of being, mere existence taking no note of time or place, darkness or light: a dim twilight of the soul, hovering on the border-land of sleep, yet gaining nothing of its blessed oblivion. That torpor, when the brain lay bound and fettered, was life I b,   Once, in that long sleep of the senses, perception dimly figured a bearded face bent over her own- cool fingers laid si  gently on her pulse--a draught held to her lips, which she drank eagerly; and the living links which had pressed upon her were lifted -perception grew faint in the twilight of memory --thought hovered over dim spaces, rarely lighted, and whose feeble flashes grew faint, and more faint, until her hardly-tried spirit nestled in the blessed oblivion of dreamless, -visionless slumber. When she awoke at last, it was to a sense of care and comfort, the luxury of a semi-twilight through folded curtains, with deep silence around her-a languid pulsing of life, which, too faint to wrestle with comprehension, made mere existence a pleasure. How many days and nights faded while she lay in that sweet slumber, she neither knew nor cared. Memory was shrouded, and she had no wish to rouse the lares of dead hopes. Life might end here; here, when hope died! To awake - to live - was to renew a dreaded conflict; to grow strong in pain, weak in resolve! A step broke the silence-a cautious footfall, that only paused at her bedside, where, with closed eyes, she lay in the luxury of perceptions too faint for pain, too shadowy for 'happines. The bearded face impressed itself upon her irids, that lay veiled under the closed lids, and memory shot one thrill of exquisite feeling, half pleasure, half terror. That   IN A CRUCIBLE.         253 sweet, bitter draught, that he had held to her lips, she had quaffed when he bade her. Her will had been reluctant, yet she had obeyed him: now, as he stood over her, the silence became oppressive; the pupils of her closed eyes quivered restlessly; a moment of positive pain, and they opened wide, and looked into his own. For an instant he looked at her, and spoke:,     . "You are better; the draught has done its work. We must not lay on the brain more than it can bear; you have handled yours roughly." "The heart," she murmured. She was not moving; she lay quite still, looking up at him. "The brain," he repeated; "the brain is the seat of sen- sation. We live through the heart; it has enough to do to perform its functions as a supporter of life: we suffer, think, and feel with the brain. You would not give yours 'the rest it demanded. Nature avenged herself! I took advantage of your weakness, and saved your life." The lips moved impetuously: "I do not thank you." He made no reply with his lips to her speech; but presently said: "Mrs. Trevor, I have treated you with rudeness on several occasions, and, I fear, thought much worse of you than you have imagined. Will you forgive it, and make a friend of me?  You need one sorely." She looked long and earnestly into the pale quiet face, full of solicitude, that met her own; then shook her head. "It is only compassion; it will wear off when I am well and strong, and you will think no better of me: indeed, you are quite right not to think too well of me," she added, quickly. He sat down  by the side of her couch, saying: "I know nothing of your history, Mrs. Trevor, nothing but that you are alone in the world, and-a  woman. Is not that suffi.   254        :IN A CRUCIBLE. cient? It is not compassion, believe me; and I think you would hardly find me one to fail you should the time eve] come when you will need my services." "I will try to believe in you," she said; "but I am not surf that when I am well and strong, all the old antagonism may not return. As to needing friends, Mr. Moreton, I am abl( to take care of myself." "You will learn better than that," he said, with a smile "you may be quite competent to do all that a woman evei did; but you can do no more; and a wider experience of the world would soon show you how many artificial aids your se2 require to sustain them." She had flushed angrily; but after a second of thought refrained from speech. quietly ignoring her displeasure, he continued: "You will be able to travel after this; we have lost time already." Her eyes questioned. "Seven days and nights," he said; "five given to the tor por of fever; two to the healing languor of my draught. You have had kind attendants in the inmates of the farm-house and I have been your physician." Seven days! and he had waited patiently upon her. The reluctant lips summoned courage to thank him. "You are kind; pray lose no more time. Leave me; I can travel alone."           He sat silent. "I am incommoding you," she repeated, restlessly. "Not personally," he Waid, quietly; "but no man's time is quite his own at present; we must avoid unnecessary delay.' He was not conventionally polite; she liked this: her eyes brightened. "You have been very kind," she repeated. "But pray do not remain here any longer on my account. I can return alone to St. Bevins."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         255 "Pardon me," he said, with his quiet, irritating smile, that always made her feel childishy ignorant; "pardon me, but the first office of my proffered friendship will be to see that you do nothing more unconventional: your travelling with me is not quite the thing, but, under the circumstances, it could hardly have been avoided: ' Necessitas quod cogit, de- fendit.' Icannot go quite to St. Bevins without the risk of capture; but there will be neither trouble nor impropriety in the ten additional miles, and I shall accompany you until that." "Shall you return directly?" "So soon as I can procure some horses which the company need; and for that I may be delayed a few days. I will have no difficulty; the parties are friends of mine, and will give me their animals sooner than have them fall into Fede- ral hands." She started up, her face flushing eagerly: "Take mine, Mr. Moreton. You will let me give him to you; he is just fit for artillery, and I have often wished him where he could do better service than scouring-the country with me." His eyes assumed their provoking light, and he said: "No, indeed; I could not wait for him; and, if I could, am not prepared to go the length of incurring any obligation from one so reluctant to assume it for herself." She looked at him deprecatingly: "That would not be the same thing."  "No," he said; "only the difference of meum and tuum." After a pause, she said: "Say when I am able to travel; and I will not hinder you a moment." "The train leaves at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon. There are no feverish symptoms; I will send you another draught. Sleep as much as you can, and think as little; and you will be able to travel." He left her. She took the draught, and obeyed his injunc-   256         IN A CRUCIBLE. tions as far as possible. He was anxious to rejoin his com- mand; and she, to be no further burden to him. She obeyed him implicitly for the remainder of the journey. She slept, ate, drank, and rested when he bade her, without question. He rarely spoke to her, except on such occasions, proffered no superfluous courtesies, and left her to her thoughts undisturbed, He ignored any claim he might have established by kindness upon her forbearance. He had put her under an obligation which he politely ignored, and compelled her to do the same. His kindnesses were scarcely more than would have been shown by any gentleman to a lady under his charge, similarly situated; but hers was a grateful nature, apt to construe acts of common courtesy into evidences of liking, and sensitively *  prone to exaggerate trifling coldnesses. She had known him sarcastic, cruel, and pitiless in her strength; but to her weak- ness he had grown merciful; strong to crush, tender to con- sole! He was asserting his rightful position: woman was subservient to man - must ever be; why had she striven to assert herself? and why, having striven, had she rebelled when his strong arm had put her down. It had been an open warfare; and when her strength gave way, he had been gen- erous. He had compelled her to say: "I am weak, and you are strong: your province is to confer--mine to receive. You protect--I shall submit;" yet he had done all this quietly and coolly; taking his natural position, and neither exultant nor triumphant. He had shown his true manhood: cruel and severe when occasion demanded, he could also be gentle and tender. After all, was not this better and sweeter? Yet here she must pause. Sweet it might be, but it was not- her position, nor ever would be. Alone she must stand, or fall! She must summon nerve, and fortitude, even at the cost of all that was most gentle, most lovely and lovable in woman. Weakness lurked beneath the softening influences that lend grace to woman's life. She must grow stern, harsh, forbid- X t   IN A CRUCIBLE.           257 ding; must summon to her aid all that would thrust tempta- tion from her. Soon familiar scenes reclaimed her attention. She was nearing home; and familiar as its outward aspect was, a great change had come to her life. Here the sweet and bitter fruit of her short existence had been garnered up. There had been reckless waste -lavish expenditure of the best gifts of her nature; and the future held no power to reclaim. Bare and brief as that outward existence had been, she had given to that deeper tide of the soul's life ceaseless measure. There had been gifts without reckoning; but when a future lay broadly before her, her prodigal spirit craved something better than these husks of a forgotten feast. "The soul is not lavish of her gifts; yetv she grants to every life some measure of its demands, and with no niggardly hand. The heart may crave, and to its narrow cry there is no answering appeal; its selfish demahds meet none of the ends of wisdom or of justice;" but the fruitage given to the soul is what it sows: that shall it reap! No life is then a failure when it. receives "gifts from the spirit, though they are denied' to the heart;" and these gifts are patience, fortitude, and self-abne- gation, born out of suffering, disappointment, and humiliation. "There is no life, howe'er in conflict spent, But shows for good 't was lent, If to its uses it has bent ;" And this season of bitterness and struggle is sent to lives where the future has need of its full requirement. When the lesson is wanted, it is given; nor is the promise or its fulfil- ment lacking--"As thy day, so shall thy strength be!"  In the allotments of life, the sweets are to some -the bitterness to others; nor is it permitted to man to sum up the reckoning. Shall we say, "All these have I rendered from my youth up; give me my reward;" the answer is still the pitiless cry that smote the struggling Israelite: "Sell all that thou hast."   258         IN A CRUCIBLE. Ay! we must barter all the riches of this life, its hopes, its longings, its great gifts --for one drop of the soul's comfort. And Parolet's portion was with these: the children of night- of spiritual darkness --whose struggles claim no sympathy, and of whom a pitiless decree exacts all; yet "their lamps God has toned and lightened " amid the darkness of a stormy life. To them he has given gifts -meagre gifts to large demands; yet which the soul clasps eagerly- holding them priceless, weighing them against all that has been withheld. To the young and ardent spirit the conflict is long and bitter. The hot heart-pants after life's present goals are not quelled at a whisper. Hope paints false gods with seductive colors. Shall we barter the sweets of near pleasure for the chance of that far-off future? Only as life wears on and on in never-ending disappointments, the heart learns to relin- quish. Then the spirit, leaning toward that vague future, gathers a sense of its promise. After patient waiting beside the pool, earnest longing that when its depths grow troubled we shall behold the angel-form, comes oft-repeated failure; yet here, disappointment does not crush: " the meed withheld to the heart, is yielded to the spirit." Unworthy thoughts, feverish longings are quenched, and we learn to bear, to suffer, and not repine! It was no easy task to Parolet Trevor to accept the destiny that lay before her: a destiny whose darkness lay between herself and her Maker. There are natures to whom renunciation is sweet; but her triumphs were ever hardly won! The fine spirit made exactions, and the strong, rebellious will of the woman was fain to submit. Yet in all the turmoil of passionate re- gret, of ceaseless longing and bitter thought, one comfort was hers. This man, who had been her rigid censor, her merci- less judge, was giving her now the full benefit of his even- handed-justice. She had not only awakened that strong ap- peal to his tenderness for woman in her weak, dependent, hour to                    A *,   IN A CRUCIBLE.          259 of sorrow; but the severe eyes had invaded her thoughts, had read her pitiless self-condemnation, and he paid a tribute silent, but intelligible, to her self-conquest. When her lips lay mute under the illness of intense mental suffering, was it nothing that her impetuous spirit was forcing a more than womanly self-control? His keen eyes divined that she was lifting herself bravely to meet the burden of some secret sorrow of whose source he was ignorant. This was true womanhood: rarely met, scrupulously honored I He was dis- armed: the mocking lips ceased to deride her claims to such homage as her great gifts demanded, and his generous man- hood paid it readily. Not a moment was it withheld when she had established her just claim to it in his eyes. He re- called his former prejudiced judgment of her, only to combat it.- He had seen her eyes grow soft and tender with the tide of sweet, womanly feeling; and he had seen them flash scorn and matchless contempt upon narrow spirits in a narrow age. He began to realize how the spiritual growth, far outmatching the life of the woman, had been distorted by the narrowing force of circumstance. The rich fruitage of her nature had drooped and withered. Planted in the luxuriant nurture of domestic affections, there were noble virtues that had blos- somed to life, blessing herself and others. She had taunted him once with narrowing to the life around him. His. heart had grown greater and his mind wider in those' years of voluntary self-sacrifice, with its con- stant demands for the reproduction of all that was noblest and best in his nature; and much of his changed judgment she owed to this, as well as to herself. His own life had been a self-sufficient one, but woman had fewer purposes, narrower aims, and less self-command. This woman's had been friend- less and joyless, yet it was self-contained. His knowledge of her was owing to a certain mental sympathy, and he rarely made mistakes.   260         IN A CRUCIBLE. Here they were to part: he, to encounter again the vicis. situdes of war; she, to enter upon .the dreary life which duty proffered, and which young desire made to seem so barren; yet both had bitter remembrances that made part- ing a pleasant pain. There were no wordy proffers of friend- ship on either side. Each knew how little meaning lies in language--how far more expressive silence often is; yet theirs was a strong compact, that wVould be kept in good- faith and mutual trust. Each knew that new-found trust would be broken at the first dereliction from rigid demands on the higher nature of the creature. Each had tried and tested its own strength, and each demanded of the other that of which it felt itself capable. It was very sweet to Paro- let; the very spirit she had once deprecated in the man, had paid its tribute too readily and gracefully, not to have become her ally. There was one, in the wide world, who thoroughly understood her; whose good opinion depended upon her ful- filment of his exactions, yet who did not despise or condemn her because she must wage a fierce warfare for victory. Meagre must--have been life's gifts to this woman, when that compact offered so sweet a content. They were to part here; perhaps, never to meet again, or to meet in society, more widely sundered than by time and distance; for society rejects all friendship between man and woman, all calm intercourse which might lead to better understanding- to greater mutual forbearance, esteem, and trust. The sexes are drawn together only by one tie: the' consummation of a compact where passionate love blindly and rashy unveils the nature we have! ignorantly studied, across a chasm of conventional observances, and where we too often learn, only to despise! Knowing how to value man's firm friendship, built upon the habits of his life, his intercourse with his fellow-men, when honor, loyalty, and truth was the foundation, this proffered gift seemed rich enough to shed a   IN A CRUCIBLE.         261 promise over her whole future; it made her good purposes strong to merit what was of sterling value, and would not be withdrawn lightly. She knew nothing of the fickle friend- ship of her own sex, lightly bestowed, lightly withdrawn, melt- ing at a word; but she knew how men could love one another -how they had loved; giving life, honor, and riches, and asking nothing in return. It was a beautiful affection; pure, firm, and true: all men's passions were stronger than women's -harder to win; more worth the keeping, when won. And this good faith was offered her: should she reject it? She knew it the sweetest gift her life had known. Promising none of the eager hope and brief disappointment of love, it would yet be a strong support, and offered companionship and mutual intercourse, greater and better and more satisfy- ing than any that association with her own sex offered. She forgot her youth, and that of the man whose friendship she sought; but remenmbering it, she would still have accepted gratefully. The world had given her nothing: it had ex- acted much, and she had rendered to society its just though arbitrary demands. Should it come between her and the few rich gifts which remained to her? There had been enough to impress upon her the deep truth that lay in the words which every woman's lips have syllabled at some time in her life: ("There is no pleasure bought without a pain." Age makes of self-renunciation a profitable philosophy--youth, a virtue! Reginald offered his friendship in good faith, but he built less upon it than the woman. She required kindness -he did not; she was accepting, in the meagreness of life, what he was proffered from its wide stores. He' valued her, now that familiar intercourse had enabled him to learn what a whole life of conventional observances had screened; he meant to befriend her so long as she claimed and merited his regard; but she was not necessary to his happiness: he could relin- ?. '4   262         IN A CRUCIBLE. quish the bond between them without pain, nor would he have scrupled to do so, had she forfeited esteem in the slight- est measure. Woman is enthusiastic by nature-- prone to place undue value upon the slight words and acts of man, which hold a much colder significance in his eyes. This truth, when forced upon her, is bitter and unpalatable, and he must bear the re- proaches due to self-deception. Man is soon wearied with exactions; and woman, to retain either his love or his friend- ship, must learn to relinquish much that is necessary to her own happiness! Nor is experience always the necessary teacher. Parolet controlled any exhibition of her disap- pointment at the quiet composure of Reginald's manner.1 He held her hand in a brief,lfirm clasp, leaving a sensation of pleasure long after his grasp was relinquished. His eyes looked into hers that were full of quiet, grateful contentment. The keen intelligence of his own was rarely darkened by any shade of feeling, yet -they looked troubled for an instant, as they rested on her face. "You are thinking of me," she said, simply; "leave that, for the present; we shall meet again soon, and I shall claim an act from your proffered friendship." "It was of the meeting I was thinking," he answered, thoughtfully. "You are very hopeful?" She wasstartled, and a quick shade gathered on her face. "Hopeful! Are not you?" He shook his head. "I have not hoped for many months. The future is not bright for any of us. Your personal griefs will seem lighter when you are forced to face this failure, not only of your own:hopes, but those of millions." For a moment she was silent--staggered with the sudden- ness of the blow-a moment of intense pain, in which the desolation of her whole life seemed to press upon her anew; then she said:   IN A CRUCIBLE.         263 "Defeat! My mind cannot compass such a possibility;" adding, quickly, "but our disappointment is nothing to yours; to the men who have fought four weary years upon that hope." ( It is very bitter," he said, with folded lips and knitted brow. It was a cold, resolute face upon which she looked; but as resolute to sustain defeat as it had been to encounter danger. After a moment his countenance cleared. l "We shall meet again. I fear the time will be short. We part here. I must hasten to rejoin my command." But Parolet was almost unmindful, now, of their parting. Her heart was sore and heavy, and rejected personal comfort. She- never guessed that he had tried to spare her sensitive nature the rude shock of sudden disaster, and to leave other thoughts to work the mind's cure from selfish repinings.   CHAPTER XXVII.

AFTER the interview in Phillis Warner's cottage, a suspi- cion had been confirmed in the Rev. Mr. Moreton's mind, in reference to Susan Warner, which had more than once found entrance. He was no great believer in the distinction of class, and was led to it more by the conduct of Phillis than by the extreme beauty and delicacy of the girl. This belief, while it did not tend to strengthen a determination already firm to remove the child from a vicious influence, enabled him to effect his purpose with less difficulty. A few days after his return he proceeded to the cottage on his mission. There was that in his face which carried its own warning to the woman; and the sudden contraction of her sullen brows showed she was prepared to contest the point by a struggle, if necessary. Arthur declined her proffered civilities, and came at once to the subject. "I am here, Mrs. Warner, with a view to removing Susan from your roof as soon as possible. I have learned enough to feel convinced that you are no proper-person to have' charge of her." His speech did not take her by surprise.- She was quite prepared for it. 'She smothered the angry gleam in her 264   IN A CRUCIBLE.         265 eyes, and strove to speak respectfully. She was not unmind- ful of the habitual awe with which Mr. Moreton's dignity and bearing inspired her. She saw in his countenance the repugnance he made no attempt to conceal; but she rightly interpreted it as detestation of her crime, not the disdainful repulsion of the high-bred for the lowly. She spoke after deliberation:                     "You have always had more authority over Susan than any one else, sir; but in her present condition this is the place for her. I cannot let her go." She was as obstinately bent on maintaining her point as the rector was on carrying his. Her tone was perfectly re- spectful; but its settled pertinacious determination was not to be mistaken. "I am not here to argue. I am justified, in my professional capacity, in using every effort to remove that child from your contaminating influence. You .have forfeited the rights of a mother in your deliberate plots for the ruin of your daughter. I am not a man to be trifled with. Susan must be removed where the consequences of her crime may be rendered as little harmful to herself as possible. Submit quietly, as good sense will dictate; if not, I will use such means as I deem ex- pedient to effect my purpose." He ceased, and folded his arms across his chest with that quiet gesture which betokened so .much of the patient, res- olute nature of the man. The womari's dogged attitude changed to one of sudden, sarcastic defiance. "Leave her to your protection! Not I. You left her here to the protection of a gentleman, like -yourself, and what came of it? I've had enough of such things. I know more about it than you think for. Poor folks and rich have nothin' to do with one -another. Xeither me nor Susan is fit for the likes of you; but Susan's no better 'n me, and so I'll teach her. I'm sick of preachin' and preachin' to the poor when 12   '266         IN A CRUCIBLE. you know nothin' about 'em. You're paid to do it, but w a'n't paid to listen; and I, for one, won't." "I never harmed your daughter, and it is with me you ar now dealing. Keep to the matter in hand, and take car what language you use. Insolence can benefit you nothing and will not at all alter my intention, Susan must leave thi as quickly and as quietly as possible; and if you have an: motherly regard for her, you will aid, instead of offering need less opposition to my plans." "I have a right to do what I like with my own. OnI would n't think it a free country when a lone woman is to b, badgered at every turn by people they've nothing to do with If Susan's taken to bad ways, I'm sorry for it; but I don' know as she's so much to blame. It's hard to do right witl want and misery drivin' you the other way, as you'd find if you tried. There's no law or justice in lookin' to poor people as you do to rich ones. The temptation's all on one side, and it a'n't ignorance nor badness drives 'em to it; it's want- just that -and you don't need me to tell it. When you've driven that from our doors, it'll be high time to preach re spectability. I don't know as Susan's any worse than the rest, that she's to be driven from her home; and all I say is she can't go." Arthur had listened quietly and patiently to her speech. It was the utterance of rugged and unpalatable truths; caught, he knew, by this- woman's artful lips from the rough, plebeian oratory of the Town Hall; the eternal rallying-cry that had sounded its alarums through the civilized world, from ages extinct until the present time; the cry of, class, that had summoned to its respective standards the rich and the poor. He was no philosopher, no moralist. He was a simple Chris- tian man; humble in his endeavors to fill an allotted and conscientious individuality in the great world; and to alle- viate,/as far as personal exertions and influence might, the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         267 canker of a diseased humanity. This was, however, a ques- tion he had no mind to argue with this woman. It had been one of the dreams of his boyhood to enter a life where a champion of justice, honor, and truth might serve the cause of suffering and oppressed humanity;' but the ardent spirit of youth had early sobered its Utopian dreams to the sadden- ing hue of unwelcome reality. He knew it was a question where argument alone could effect little. He had come, at last, to accept as a fact what he still denied as a necessity; and he failed to satisfy himself as to whether it was one of the inscrutable, mysterious -decrees of the Infinite, which only the lore of another world would unfold, and the justice of another world would right, or whether it was an- evil sown by the passions and frailties of man, which, incurred by the mass, recoiled on the individual. In the wide field of politics he had seen few whose talents were enlisted in behalf of the- people, whose boasted ballot and right of franchise was a mockery and a cheat. Its broad arena was but a sickening exhibition of the vile passions of selfish, brutal manhood, clothed in the gauds of polite society! The man of to-day was the man of thousands of years ago; and the enthusiastic soul of youth sickened under repeated disappointments. Yet he knew that in the nobler world of letters there were " lamps, toned and lighted" on-high, that were shedding the refulgent light of genius on a darkened world; and that the work left unfinished was taken up in a continued mission of enlight- enment and brotherly love! "There is much truth in what you say.; but I am not here to argue questions, which my ignorance fails to solve, and where yours unfits you for a just comprehension. It is a simple question of morality, which my office compels and fits me to deal with: a question of the eternal welfare of your child. As to a- mixture of classes, there is no attempt of that nature in contemplation. The temporal comfort of your   268       -  IN A CRUCIBLE. daughter will be insured, that she run no risk, through the temptations you so feelingly describe, to sin anew. It is not my province to punish her seducer, even if I possessed a clue to his identity, which I do not. I take no small share of blame to myself, that I remained so long in ignorance of the danger Susan incurred from the indulgence of habits unsuited to her station and condition in life." A smile of malignant meaning hovered on the lips of Phillis Warner: "Susan's fit to be a lady; she's pretty enough," she said. "One would not blame you for an honest pride in your daughter's comeliness; and it is possible she may possess all the attributes you ascribe to her. I am not observant of such matters; yet, to your shame, you have bartered her fair name, from God knows what motive. It is an extent of criminality so loathsome I would not willingly contemplate it; I rather choose to believe you devoid of the rights of maternity you have assumed over this girl. Refuse to obey me, and I force you to prove your right to withdraw her from my pro- tection." His observant eyes had fixed themselves keenly upon her face as he made this speech. The angry flush faded, and a dull, sulky pallor usurped its place, rendering the repulsion of the countenance extreme. Arthur's suspicions were verified. After a momentary silence, the woman spoke. Her tone had altered to one of fawning servility.  "And what is to become of me, if I let you have Susan? I must live; and she is all the help I have. I am often sick, and can't work; what is to keep the wolf from my door'? Crime follows temptation: you are a clergyman." There was a momentary struggle in Arthur's breast before he replied to this speech; then he said, in his customary tone of quiet composure: "You have no claim upon Susan; remember that! Nor   IN A CRUCIBLE.         269 did I come here with any view to bargain for your comfort or convenience; still, as you say, I am a clergyman: otherwise, I should not have compelled myself, reluctantly, to stand - under your roof, or bandy words with you. So long as you refrain from interference with Susan, provision shall be made for you against the possibility of absolute want. I am per- suaded that you are concealing knowledge that might pos- sibly be of benefit to this girl, whom you have so deeply wronged; but I must leave it to your conscience to make a revelation which I cannot force. I cannot fathom the de- pravity of the human heart; but I will not believe you utterly callous. You have sinned most vilely against this young creature; you have brought reproach upon me, your pastor, and upon one very near and dear to me. Woman! vile, degraded as you may be, all this has not been without a motive.". He ceased, abruptly.' He had desired to close his interview without any exhibition of emotion--without any appeal which, he felt,-would be useless; yet he had yielded to a strong feeling of indignation, and he now turned hastily away.  A low laugh issued from the lips of Phillis Warner: "Motive!" she said, contemptuously- "motive! Nay, nay, Mr. Moreton. . I may be as bad as you think me, but is Susan likely to be better? Ugly blood, ugly blood: like mother, like child! As to your friend, he was wise as the serpent when he came here lecturin' me, but there the Scripture ended - he was n't harmless as a dove when he pounced on mine. 'T was the serpent still, or the devil quotin' Scripture." She ended with a coarse laugh. Arthur turned away saddened, and disgusted. He had no belief in her assertion of the relationship between them; yet there was a connecting link of sin, which he could not deny -a sin the nature of which was too revolting to contemplate in one so fair, so childish, so seemingly simple and guileless I Phillis watched the stalwart form out of sight. The un-.   270         IN A CaRUCIBLE.      . usual dejection of the resolute step, the bending of the head, , as he lifted his hat under the evening sky, smote her with a . slight feeling of remorse.      . "Ah! he's a good one, anyhow, let the rest be what they may; but what's that to me?" A frown gathered on the bent brows, and she raised her hand with that sudden gesture of rude, natural eloquence that deep feeling teaches the unlettered: "Motive, Arthur Moreton-motive!"she reiterated. "Hate! revenge! Are these motives strong enough? Has Phillis Warner a right to hate such as you? Gentlemen! Ay, ay; the world honors such as you; despises the women you have stooped to wrong: honest women enough, till you tam- pered with 'em. Justice! ay, I know what that means. Justice to his child! Did I ever get justice? Scorn, and taunts, and insults at my folly! Does death wipe out such a memory? Scorn, jeers, and laughter to me; to me, who loved him so. Yes; I loved him once. Ahl God, how welll I'd 've died for him-; and I was an honest woman then." The frown died from her brow, the coarse lips moved con- vulsively, and covering her face with her arms, the woman wept long and bitterly. "His child," she muttered; " his child! how I hate her -how I hate her I Yet I loved him once- once, when I was good!"   CHAPTER XXVIII. "AND IN MY FLESH, THE SIN OF HERS, ALAS!"  . . " (What lover among men But hath his sense fed sov'reignly 'twixt whiles With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles And soft disaster of a pained face?" Swinburne. ARTHUR MORETON returned once more to St. Bevins-to his dust-covered volumes - his favorite haunts - perplexed, harassed, and annoyed; but books and manuscripts remained untouched. 'He could only sit watching the shadows as they gathered deep and sombre over Moreton Place; or wander out, to trace, in dim abstractions, the faint, silvery light of the moon, as it rose over the peaked roof and gables of the family mansion. He had signified his intention of removing Susan Warner, but his plans yet wanted the concurrence of Mrs; Trevor, whose arrival he impatiently awaited. Delay in any form was vexatious, and the long-sought interviiS^as accordingly ill-timed. He-was not much moved to softer feel- ings, even when she stood before him in her mourning robes, with the careworn look of sorrow and travel on her white face; yet he was agitated, as he always was, in the presence of this woman. Deprived of the rich coloring, the vivacious play of feature which had made the voluptuous charm of the countenance, its character was marked with a prominence he had never before observed. The colorless hue of the cheek, the passion- less repose of the features, the subdued, chastened expression of the eyes, lent to her striking countenance the elevation and purity of sculpture; and Arthur Moreton, gazing upon it, became first aware of that marvellous beauty of the antique 271 [    272         IN A CRUCIBLE. -a beauty of soul--lending an enchantment far greater than the hues of life and coloring which pander to the sensual taste of the vulgar. For the first time, in all his life, there awoke within him a sense of beautiful, pure womanhood, appealing only to the sentiment of his manhood, and he paid involuntary homage to its dignity and power. It was a new and strange sensation -a sudden light of revelation, adverse to his whole nature, and to the habits of a lifetime -a revelation the -more sur- prising, treading as it did upon that dark page in the life of woman which had, but a moment before, made in his eyes the condemnation of her sex. Side by side through life are twin forms, which man terms the Real, and the Ideal! Was he confounding them now? Never alive to sentiment, he recovered himself from that momentary gleam of divine light, and refused belief to that which held no sympathy with his nature. Living in a world of action, Arthur Moreton would have been but a type of that large class of men who, ardent in temperament, apathetic in character or sentiment, quick in senility, slow of intellect, reflect the passions whose sordid source they have not the power to question, and under whose sway man, the archetype of the Creator, only retains that fine sense that preserves him from debasement! To his dreamy, meditative youth, and the subtle refinements of a literary life, he owed all the elevation of character which now redeemed his nature. A dim sense of something higher was struggling through the rugged crust of blunted suscepti- bilities, but he was thrusting it from him, as man too often strives to resist the ,divine light of the soul in its strivings with the dull nature of the creature--was building up a dogged belief in himself and his own convictions--and re- fusing faith in the countenance upon which sorrow and self- sacrifice had written such unmistakable hieroglyphics that he who ran might, read!   IN A CRUCIBLE,..        273 "Forgive me," she said, falteringly, as she sought in his cold countenance an interpretation of his silence; "forgive me that I have intruded upon you, unsought. Not even the U justifiable curiosity to learn my fate had urged me to a step which you probably condemn as unwomanly; yet, yet, Arthur Moreton, what has your calling to do with society, or its con- ventions? What have I to do with them?" The closing words of her speech had been wrung from her, almost involuntarily, by the unmoved coldness of A:rthur's demeanor, and the absence of that friendship which she felt she had a right to expect. "Everything," he returned. "Man requires restrictions -the iron bands of a rigid necessity, to curb the unruly pas- sions of his nature; woman - how much more?" he added, in a tone of cutting, contemptuous bitterness, which made his speech doubly cruel. "You are right," she said, simply; " right in placing man first, under this necessitous law for the right conduct of his social life: woman is inevitably guided by man. I am not here to discuss questions of law, ethics, or morality with you. Recent events have made the revelation you bring of less moment than when I sought it first, eagerly, at your hands. Your mission and its results involve the happiness of no one but myself." She glanced at her dress, her lip quivered, and she turned hastily away to conceal the tears that hung crystal-bright on - her dusky lashes. Arthur's stoicism was moved. "Forgive my harshness. I am scarcely myself," he said, passing his hand hastily over his brow. "I have not been unmindful of your trouble.. I have travelled back with a heart weighed down with the burden of that which it was my portion to afflict you with; and I, arrived here to find you absent, and to have my mind harassed with a heavy care and responsibility, which found me totally unprepared to sustain 12* 4   274         IN A CRUCIBLE. it. I have used the privilege of friendship; and my disap pointment and ill-humor has recoiled tupon you." He put out his hand with a smile; but his attempted ai of composure was a poor counterfeit, and Parolet saw that h trembled violently. She held his extended hand for an in stant, released it, and said: "You spoke, just now, of disappointment, to be inflictec upon me. Before you proceed, hear me. I reject now, an( forever, any theory of entailed sin. I will not relinquish m: birthright as a Christian woman. H-" She paused, abruptly; overcome by an emotion too stronh for words. Arthur rose to his feet. "You think thus," he exclaimed; "then I need neve: speak that, the bare memory of which has haunted me unti it has effected what vigil and fasts never could; until it haw wasted my flesh, and dried up the healthful springs of mj being.' Parolet had not noticed that he had grown emaciated; that the dull pallor of mental disquietude had usurped the ensan guined hue customary to his heavy features: she scarcely noticed it now. "Nay, nay; whatever that revelation be which has cost you so much, bear it still, for my sake. Evil as have been the passions entailed upon me by race, I have combatted them all --I will to the end! I would hear nothing that must lessen the respect I bear to my father's memory. He, like myself, was a victim to a dark fate, which, strive as I will, holds a fearful power of belief over my mind; but, he was a man, stronger in his passions, and devoid of that faith which is inherent in woman's nature, of that susceptibility to the influences of nattire which shall--must, work my cure. Do not think I seek to shirk a knowledge of my, or rather my father's history, from any desire to shun. the responsibility which such knowledge involves. If it was not insanity, it   IN A CRUCIBLE.         275 is something even more to be dreaded, because more decep- tive, and in which consciousness is an ever-present torture. With no belief in it as an inevitable curse, I should yet shrink from entailing upon another the nature whose struggles have been one fierce warfare for my womanhood. I deceive my- self with no false hopes of happiness; the joys that form the beauty of other women's lives, can never be mine! Do not blame me, Arthur Moreton, if I am sometimes bitter, some- times unwomanly. You know nothing of my life - what it has been! Deceived, betrayed - devoid of all the pure affec- - tions which adorn life, what is left me but the hard, dry path of duty, which, in this world, meets no reward. What have I, then, to do with the world? I know it, only to despise -its fawning on the rich and powerful; its trampling upon ob- scurity and poverty; its cheats and snares; its honest meed withheld; man but a sycophant of place and power; woman -ah! here your sarcasm fell short of the truth. Too pitiful for aught but contempt'-full of envy, malice, deceit, and treachery, from which the honor of manhood would revolt - inature has denied her a code of honor; and society justly denies her the right of redress for a quality whose possession it ignores! There are noble exceptions, which only prove the rule; and I have ceased to study idiosyncrasies too variable to be termed character, and with which I have too little sym- pathy to comprehend." There was much of passionate anger in her remarks; but there was much, too, of that contemptuous scorn of small natures which made the fine fibre of her- own character. Arthur knew that she had spoken a pitiable but bitter truth. He had seen enough of the sex, to acquiesce in a portion at least of her statement, unflattering as it might be. He knew the characteristics she had pointed out had been the barrier which had separated: the few true, highminded women from the mass, and had thrown them upon the society of the male   276      -  I A CRUCIBLE. sex for sympathy and companionship. The want of honest truth, the pitiable refuge in conventional insincerity, the spirit of detraction, the small envy, the treacherous betrayal of confidence, he recognized as part of the female character; and he knew, too, that she who rose above them, was not only widely severed from all sympathy, but became a mark of vituperation, envy, and detraction. He knew that, even where the intelligence was slow, venom lent to dull wit the poisoned barb of a ready tongue! Alas! was it fromn the hand of woman he must seek refuge and protection for his erring charge? After a pause, he said: "Harsh as your picture is, I recognize much in it that must excuse the scorn of the right-minded of your sex; yet I was about to demand your sympathy and protection for one of these. Can you--will you show yourself above the preju- dices of your sex? Will you assert your right to the woman- hood you claim, in its highest demand upon the respect and admiration of man? Mrs. Trevor, you have refused to listen to all that might shake your faith in your just right of in- heritance in the atonement of mankind; you have expressed your determination to follow the uninviting path of duty: a path which, none know better than I, is joyless. Will you add one duty more to those you have already assumed?" He bent eagerly toward her. She raised her eyes to his, and there passed into them an expression which, at the time, he could not define. "Those I have already assumed," she repeated. "Alas! you know not how bitter they are how repugnant! If I 'have erred in separating myself from sympathy with my sex, have I not suffered for it? I know what you mean, Arthur Moreton: am I a man, that you should ask this thing of me?" She rose, and paced the room, continuing: "That he   IN A CRUCIBLE.         2" should have asked it of me! Alas! I have not the great soul of man; I have but the frail heart, the despicable passions of woman: her weakness, her temptations, her pitiful cries for love and tenderness. Despise me; for, scorning my sex, I am but a woman still!" She covered her face with her hands, and wept violently. Her speech startled and surprised Arthur. How could she know what he- meant? Her tears-the unusual burst of womanly emotion, unmanned him. The rebellious heart of the man strove for the mastery: before he could conquer its dictates--while he still stood mute and apathetic, her self- command returned to her. "You do not understand me," she said. "You once warned me that the revelation of family histories is an un- wise move; yet, somewhat of that history must now be un- folded to you. Many argue that the grave should close on the follies and vices of man; and that his virtues only should live: so be it! I make no remarks on the character of my husband. My marriage was the oft-repeated mockery of a hand without a heart. Women who have realized the sanctity of the marriage-tie, are pitiless to the frailties of their sex. I recognized only its loathsomeness; yet I was an obedient, attentive, virtuous wife. I believed, as most wives do, in the loyalty of my husband: I, an unloving wife, had been true to him; he, who professed to love me, must certainly be no less so. Society, Mr. Moreton, has no restrictions for man; even- handed justice turns aside when he must render forfeit. You may not think the less of my husband, when you learn that he summoned me to his death-bed, a long and wearing journey, not that he might lay his last kiss on my lips, but that he might receive from those that had never lied, an as- surance: that his mistress and her child should receive redress at my hands." She paused. There were no tears in her eyes now; no fal-   278         IN A CRUCIBLE. tering in her voice. The wrongs of the injured woman rose up, and rendered the voice singularly calm. "You gave the promise?" questioned Arthur. "I did; and he asked more. He asked my forgiveness." Again she paused: "Did I give that promise? you will say. No! None but those who have known the temptations of a life like mine, can know the bitterness memory must ever possess. My youth seemed to have fled; and with it, all the gentler feel. ings that belong to its age of illusions and Utopian chi. meras."- Arthur realized fully, all that promise had cost her: not the rendering up of fortune, but the giving'to one who had wronged and outraged her, the assurance that had soothed the remorseful conscience of the dying; nor could he mar. vel that her womanly heart refused to yield more. After a silence, Parolet resumed: "I had deemed all bitterness quelled; but you will for. give something to a woman's weakness. It will be conquered eventually--must be, if I would redeem my promise. To few women would such a pledge involve so little sacrifice of per- sonal comfort as that exacted of me. I have been wealthy and idle: I will be poor and laborious. The happiness which most women covet, I will learn, in time, to relinquish. The dreams of disappointed youth must give place to active ex- ertions in behalf of others, where the bitter passions of my nature must be fought down ceaselessly. Life seems a weary thing; but ' the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea:' and oh! Arthur," she added, passionately, "you, at least, will not despise me; you will believe in me, and trust me." "I can never despise you," said Arthur, hoarsely; "I can never distrust you, hereafter: but if you conquer, ascribe it to Him, whose mercy is infinite: and oh! Mrs. Trevor, learn to look less for sympathy from man: man, who has denied   IN A CRUCIBLE.        . 279 you that, or pity in your dark hours. Remember your own confession, that God and nature have never failed you; and look to Him to rejoice for you when victory is won." "Whose mercy is infinite!" she murmured. "You have done well-to rebuke me. If I could only feel nearer to Him! but I cannot. The darkness is too recent, and seems to warn me against trusting to a light stronger than my dim eyesight will bear. I am trespassing on your time. You are pre: pared to learn that the girl in whose behalf you have soli- cited my aid, is my husband's mistress. What would you have me do, Mr. Moreton?" Her voice was wonderfully controlled; but the sharp con- traction of th'e brows showed the speech was not made with- out an effort. A thought came into Arthur's mind which held him mute for a few moments: a thought of the effort which cost this woman so much, made with scarcely a mur- mur, which he had shrunk from asking of those of her sex of whom the deed demanded -only charity! And they claimed a purity greater than hers! Then he spoke: "I am asking much of you- more than is just or right; but I come to you as to a friend. I know you have the cour- age to dare more than most women: I believe you have strength to suffer more." "I have suffered all my life," she murmured, with a re- newal of the sharp, painful contraction of the countenance. Arthur looked at her compassionately. "You have; nor have I th'e right to ask you to bear more. I will find some other method of disposing of the girl. -If I altogether looked upon this as a common case," he continued, abstractedly; "but I do not. I feel singularly interested in her. - I have strong doubts as to the truth of the alleged re- lationship to Phillis Warner; and then, one must not be un- mindful of the heavy responsibility of any case of this nature. It lies very heavily upon me. The consequences of a first    280         IN A CRUCIBLE. commission of sin rest, often, only with the delinquent; but that after-season of continued degradation, misery, and crime, must be more frequently ascribed to society. Do you not see that inertness and cowardice in me would be crime?" "And in me," said Parolet, firmly. "My husband the author of this unhappy girl's disgrace, what so proper as that I should save her as much as possible from future evil? It is another legacy left me from the grave," she added, bitterly. "I will do what you wish, Mr. Moreton; only tell me what is best. Yet it is hard," she repeated. "If you could only see into my heart, and learn what a tempest of evil passions raged there, before I was brought to this!"  She checked herself, suddenly. "Yet I must think as little of myself as possible. Is it your wish that I should 'take personal charge of this girl?" Arthur did not answer immediately; when he did, his tone was quiet and business-like: "If you will do so until you can place her in a position of trust and security, with responsible persons, it would be as well. I have asked a great deal of you: I will endeavor to smooth things as much as possible. It seems to me best that Susan should be entirely removed from  her present surroundings and influences. Will you take charge of her to New York? You could give some plausible reason for the journey, and take her as a servant. This will suffice for neighborhood gossip. Thank Gpod  there is no suspicion, as yet. I have written to a brother clergyman there, and made satisfactory arrangements for her disposal; but she must be conveyed to- her destination by one whom  I deem entirely trustworthy. You will see that I could not very well undertake this in  person," he continued, with a painful flush; " and there need  be no publicity to the fact of your interest in the matter." "That would not affect me," said Parolet, coldly. "I will do as you desire; and, having once left, you may use your   IN A CRUCIBLE.         281 own discretion as to making a public statement. Parolet Trevor has no favor to ask of the world, that she should shun its venom; and can never blush for an act like this." She folded her cloak around her, and held out her hand. Arthur took it mutely. He looked into her face longingly; for a few seconds 'the- old feeling came over him -the old fascination. He longed for the power of speech. Might he not tell her of his gratitude, his admiration, his renewed trust in her?- The old hesitation-the old distrust in himself rushed upon him, while his lips struggled for speech; and he dropped the hand, and, still silent, turned with herl to the door. At its threshold she paused, turned toward him, put her hand once more on his, with that quick motion so pecu- liar to her; and while her whole face softened and thrilled, these words found utterance: "Ah, Mr. Moreton! what a pity you never married! What a strong trust some woman might have had in you! You would never have belied her faith in man. Your life is not a lost, but a mistaken one. Domestic happiness softens and elevates human life; and what a power of happiness you might have conferred upon some woman! I honor and trust you above all living men!" The speech ended: Arthur scarcely knew how or when! He only knew they were words which should never have been spoken to him: least of all, from her! But the words troubled him no more when he stood alone in his room, with a frightened, guilty consciousness, looking down upon the hand she had held -a hard, sun-browned, unclerical hand, blistering under the hot touch of a woman's impetuous lips.   CHAPTER XXTX.

MORE than a month had passed away, and Arthur had learned, in a few brief lines, of Parolet's safe arrival with her charge. Few and brief as they were, he learned, also, of the intense relief it was to her to be freed from her responsibility, and, therefore, what the errand had cost her. Grave as his countenance always was, it wore a look of care now, that had never left it since that memorable night in which, maddened by her presence, her speech, and the touch of her lips, he had laid his own, passionately, reverently, on the spot yet warm with her caress. The pained, humbled, contrite man bore in his bosom- the weight of sin, the knowl- edge of a weakness that shamed him. Fervently he prayed, with the earnest devoteeism of Catholic piety, that never more might his sight be gladdened by her face, never more might the sin of her flesh send him sorrowing to his God. Night and day, bitter memories-the degradation of consciously unhallowed thought, haunted him. Pale, stern, and silent, his countenance worn with mental conflict, the Rev. Arthur Moreton was debating with himself a question which more, than ever forced itself upon him. Often, in the last twelve months, the thought had arisen: "Am I fitted for my-calling? 282   IN A CRUCIBLE.         283 Shall I only avoid sin by fleeing from it?" Irresolute he had never been, though slow in arriving at conclusions; yet much in his life had given color to such an accusation. He had changed his faith; he had more than once abandoned his professional duties; and in no instance had he vouchsafed a word of explanation. His motives had been purely con- scientious; yet he remembered, now when an inconsistency greater than all was forcing itself upon him, some words of Constance, spoken when he had sorely tried her faith in him: "Arthur, it is not sufficient that we always do right! That right must sometimes be made apparent to others." It had always been apparent to him; clear as day, lucid as the word of God which he had so long -and so prayerfully studied. Equally conscious now of his sin--the dread of his over- mastering passion made him contemplate with terror the risk of bringing further disgrace upon his beloved Church! Weak, guilty in thought, by no act of his own, by no strength of his own, had he been saved the sin and the shame of others. An unworthy instrument in the Church's service he must feel himself henceforth. Such had been his unceasing train of thought. Any worldly consideration was thrust out of sight. What might be said of his conduct by society, by his family -even bv the Church, whose supreme authority over his ac- tions he had ever submissively acknowledged-was not to be considered for a moment. Alone in his chamber, he was the priest of God, wrestling, as the Hebrew of old, in prayer for dominion; beseeching that light- a little light, might be granted! Was it a temptation of Satan that whispered: "Absolve yourself from priestly vows, unholy that thou art! She is free!"And ever and anon the priest's eyes fell upon his hand, and irresolute lips muttered prayers that they might not fall again into sin! This could not last. He had had one severe lesson already upon self-absorption. Weeks of moody and irresolute thought had won him from the press-  284         IN A CRUCIBLE. ing cares of his ministry--cares no less urgent that he had been temporarily absolved from his ministration. The light of religious truth burned with the sullen fire of an egoism so intense, so painful, that relief must come in action, or in- sanity. On such a mood Allan Fenwick's letter broke: "My trial is over: over at last, and I am to be sent abroad temporarily. Had the matter been Jeft to me, I had far rather remained here, and endured all the penalty of my disgrace; but having submitted myself to the authority of the Church, I must abide by the decision of those in authority. I can see, too, its wisdom. Such a scandal must fall more heavily upon the Church than upon the individual; nor have I the right, having once placed myself in so responsible a situation, to seek martyrdom, at the risk of drawing reproach upon the cause of Christianity. Every defalcation among professing Christians has that effect; therefore, independent of personal feeling, I truly rejoice that this matter has been settled with so little publicity. Your prompt removal of Susan Warner from the scene of her disgrace, and the equally prompt deci- sion4f Bishop    , has saved public scandal. Do not un- derstand that I consider myself at all relieved of the terrible responsibility of sin, even though I know myself less gravely guilty than I at first imagined. On the contrary, as God is my witness, I had sooner righted that little creature at any cost of personal feeling than known her the vile, corrupt creature she has proved. Yet, I am forced to see how God sometimes supports his cause on earth, when, the sinful, weak, or perverse will of the human creature would cause its over- throw. It has brought me to feel that we cannot always follow the dictates of our own conscientiousness, unless we are willing to incur the terrible responsibility of undoing the work of Christ. Have we a right to do this? Shall we not rather trust to his merciful judgment and protecting wisdom? This now brings me to a consideration, to which my own troubles   have forced me, regarding yourself. When I go abroad, your former rectorship will be vacant. You must come down and resume it. I have always thought you wrong in resigning it at all. As to your motives, no doubt they were satisfactory to yourself, but they were not equally so to others; and I have ceased to consider any individual opinion a proper guide in such cases. You are bound to fulfil the duties you have assumed unless released by the authority of the Church: an authority which we believe to be vested in them by a greater authority on high. In all matters of conscience, we must submit our case to the Church; and I feel sure that we but act submissively to the will of Christ, in abiding by the Church's decision. Remember what power and sanctity Christ conferred upon the Church. Shall we lightly set it aside? If I once questioned the divine right of the Church's ministers, I must lose my reverence, and plead that my own will is as good as any other man's; but unless I do recognize this divine right and authority, I am no minister of the Cath- olic Episcopal Church. Again, I must tell you that an ac- tive assumption of the duties of your rectorship is desirable on your own account. You have sadly changed, old boy! Take care that .you lose not the light of religion; for it is our only legitimate guide: without that, there is little dis- tinction between man and brute; but remember, too, that that is all the difference in the world." Arthur folded up the letter, put it out of sight, and dropped his head on his arm. If there was light in it, it was a direct reflection from a soul sorrow-laden like his own; a light shed mercifully, in answer to prayer, received by one who had every faculty sharpened by the keen sense of personal weak- ness: of one awakened to the sweet sense of implicit reliance on heavenly grace and teachings. And he, too, must receive it. He, too, must feel his dependent situation in the Church. That body would never sanction his removal for the unpre-   286         IN A CRUCIBLE. meditated sin of the flesh. In the distinction between actual sin and the promptings of the carnal nature, lay a wide chasm -a breathing pause-into which the light of Chris. tian religion was to shine, marking the difference between man and brute that Fenwick had designated as making "all the difference in the world "! He had not lost his manhood in that evil hour -his Chris. tian manhood; and the sickening sense of degradation lifted its weary weight from his heart. That breathing pause had been mercifully granted him; that one fatal step between the sinful thought and the sinfil deed had been spared its bitter fulfilment; and there remained to him only the task of shak- ing from his soul its defilement, and answering the call of' duty in his Master's service. He must see Fenwick before his departure. That nature seemed now lifted far above his own. Whence had his own fall come? Alas I had he not need of all the light of Christian grace to battle against the supremacy of  the animal? Yet, since the fatal hour in which he had with- drawn himself from the imperative duties of his calling, it had fled him! He had wandered far from the truth; he had succumbed to sinful thought; and there was nothing left for him but to go back to his work, humbly and repentantly, and seek anew the grace of God. Had not she, too, rebuked his faithlessness when she said, "Tell me nothing. I dis- avow all belief in the possibility of entailed sin. I will maintain my freewill as His valued gift, and battle for my Christian birthright." In the warm light of the spring evening, Arthur stood once more in his old lodgings, with Allan's hand clasping his, and Allan's sweet voice giving' comfort.- It always had brought comfort to Arthur's chafed spirit; and now, the gentle, patient nature, humbled, but hopeful, shamed and pained while it soothed.   IN A CRUCIBLE.        287 They were to part here; to meet again when time and change had robbed both of much of the freshness of feeling that passes away with our advancement to maturer years; yet they would always be friends-true, faithful friends! There were few words on either side. How painfully this scene brought to mind that first tea-drinking? gay, laughing Allan, swaying himself on the arm of the chair, and ridicul- ing Arthur's clumsy efforts at tea-making! Something of the same thought came into Fenwick's mind, and the old look, half wistful, and full of affectionate remembrance, dawned upon the fair, delicate face. "Ah, Arthur, there was virtue in those teacups! I broke my compact, for I never used them; and that, and my dis- dain for other humble things, brought me to grief." Arthur was too much unmanned with old memories, and the parting, to make any audible reply. He put back his untasted tea, and remained silent, looking into Allan's face. After a pause, he said: "You intimated in your letter, Allan, your belief that the end of this long and bitter conflict was drawing near. If this be the case, our separation need not be for long. I an- ticipated such a result; but you will believe me when I say that that belief had nothing to do with-with" he paused, in momentary hesitation -" with my refusal to alter the ritual, and consequent resignation. You have never thought me a Union-man, that most inconceivable thing in one Southern- born and reared!" "Most contemptible, you might say," interrupted Fenwick, hotly. "No, I did not; but I never held your views, and had rather not discuss such a question with you. If you must know the truth, old boy," he added, with a smile, half-roguish and a little satirical, "I think you slightly too d6vot, and alto- gether Romanist: you have too many cases of conscience on hand. A man's acts amount to much more than his   288         IN A CRUCIBLE. creeds; and one is good. for nothing without the other, you know." Arthur remained silent. Fenwick put out his hand. "I have not pained you?" he questioned. "No," said Arthur, slowly; "you misapprehend me; but I quite agree with you that it is useless to argue these ques- tions. As to conscience, I have always felt it the safest guide in all relations." "In all that relates to yourself, no doubt," interrupted Fenwick, eagerly; "but not quite as regarded your relations toward others, and toward the Church. Reflect how much seeming inconsistencies must affect that, which -is of more value than yourself." Arthur made no reply. He was not convinced; but he had lost that overweening confidence in himself that had once led him into trouble. After a longer pause than usual, he said: "I spoke with a view to settling any doubts you might have in reference to my political opinions, if I can be said to, hold any: so much was due to our friendship. It is also due to another "- he spoke now with effort -"' that I should put you in a position to render justice to one whom you, in con- junction with many others, have, I believe, deeply wronged - in thought, I mean." He paused. Allan spoke: "You allude to Mrs. Trevor. I spoke from an unjustifiable' feeling of prejudice--ground- less, so far as I know: will this suffice?"Then, with the first dash of his old humor Arthur had seen, he resumed: "You once argued down my theory of antipathies; per- liaps you'll allow it is a less dangerous one than that of affinities." He sobered on the instant; but Arthur had not been dis- pleased to see this glimpse of his former self. His' elasticity of spirit would serve him in his calling. It required cheer-   IN A CUCSIBLE.         2A 89 fulness and active energy; and no spirit utterly burdened could- render these. Allan resumed: "I shall not again set myself up in judgment. I am sorry to have wronged her with a moment's doubt. I believe her, however, to be one not easily affected by any opinion society may form or express of her. Indeed, it would be difficult to say in what way she had incurred censure. I do not doubt the truth of what you say; and can only believe it one of those cases-not uncommon, I grieve to say -in which a cruel verdict is rendered where no possible justification has been given. But such prejudices, once formed, are not easily re- moved; and as in this case it could only be done by a reve- lation of painful family history, it had better be left alone. I fear the innocent suffer more frequently than -the guilty in this world." Arthur saw that he had little interest in the subject, and allowed it to drop. They parted here, with that simple clasp of the hand that, in man, means so much; with eyes taking affectionate fare- well, and silence far more expressive than words--to meet no more on earth. A few months of patient exile, of cheerful labor, and the sod of a foreign land lay on Allan Fenwick's breast. A line of farewell came from that lonely death-bed to the friend of his boyhood, and revealed its secret: "I had hoped to be something nearer to you one day, old boy. Edith-  But these are not the thoughts that are pressing upon me now. I am to die here, Arthur, away from all who care for me; but God is good, and my last hours are not friendless. Had he seen fit to spare me, I might have worked out a long life of usefulness and repentance; but I will not question his wisdom. Some day you will find my grave in the 'strangers' burial-place.' That is a bitter thought! But He will take all bitterness from me at the last 1 13  290         IN A CRUCIBLE. I feel sure of this! If I did not-- "And here the letter ended - ended with the failing pen and the dimmed sight! It had been enclosed by a stranger, with a few lines announcing his peaceful death and respectable burial. The long habit of self-control, of outward calm, had not made Arthur Moreton's heart callous; and the first uncon. trolled burst of manly emotion in his life gushed from him  over the trembling lines from his friend's hand. "Edith!" he whispered; "it should have been Constance:' she was worthy of him." Yet Allan's love sanctified the petulant, haughty Edith in his eyes. He was more tender to her after the knowledge of that dead secret which he had never guessed; and caused  Edith's blue eyes to open in unfeigned astonishment at caresses from one usually so undemonstrative. No suspicion that it had been misplaced dawned upon him until the lus. trous eyes of Constance turned from the open page upon his own. Then, like a flash, her secret passed into his keeping! But it was safe there. The romance of one from whom youth seemed long since to have fled, would have awakened little  sympathy from most men; but there was in the gentle, patient spirit of Constance too much that was akin to his own for him to hear unmoved that she, too, had suffered, an4 made no sign! Cold, proud, and calm, she had a true woman's heart in her breast; and when Edith had put away all memory of that dead secret, and become a happy wife and mother, Constance, true only to herself, filled her lonely destiny by Arthur's hearth; aiding his labors, and cheering -as only a woman can--a life scarcely less desolate than her own: listening, in after years, when memory had grown les painful, and the chestnut hair lay silvered on her brow, to the rector's reminiscences of "when we were boys together"'   CHAPTER XXX.

THE '"brief, bitter bliss" was over of our great Contest. "Brief and bitter " it was; though if for a great sin, we could not be made to see it; nor probably ever will, unless the name of that great first Rebel Patriot be struck from the list of the apotheosized I They were not blissful memories that awoke- thought on Parolet Trevor's brow, when she had     entered once more her husband's home, to find how truly the grand fabric of her life had crumbled, in that general ruin; how     deeply interwoven with all that she could: lay hold upon, was that cherished love of- country! Yet, after the first rude shock, she had settled to her vigorous purpose to follow out a plan of life which should leave her, as  little as possible, to either memories or hopes. She had need of all her self-reliance: friends she had none; and her plan, carefully conned and systemized, had yet to-meet the: sanction   and approval of the  only one  who lad established   any claim  upon her.  She had  never seen Reginald since her parting   with him a few  months previous 291.   292         IN A CRUCIBLE. to the surrender. She had learned, on her return from New York, that he had settled quietly to the practice of his pro- fession in the city, and there she determined to seek his coun. sel and advice. If time had wrought great changes in her character and the purposes of her life, it had left little trace upon the coun. tenance; and there was much to remind Reginald of that first interview under her husband's roof. He had now learned to feel a deep and absorbing interest in her, that had filled his leisure hours, that had altered from cold criticism to a fasci- nation to which he had insensibly yielded, as other aims vanished. Few men ever inclined more to implicit faith in themselves than did Reginald Moreton: few ever so closely calculated the chances of failure or success; nor were any so "indifferent to obstacles which chance or fortune might throw in their path. He had been quite sure they would meet again; and in that assurance had been satisfied to wait patiently, while he was able to move in matters more nearly concerning himself. Had that assurance for a moment forsaken him, he would have pursued a different course. He was no Moreton if he- could brook any crossing of his purposes; and that purpose now -was to make this woman his. He cared little when she would yield, having once settled that she was to do so even- tually. He formed no plans for seeing her, or for winning her, when seen. He was something of a fatalist, and believed that she was to control 'his destiny: had known it from the first moment the clear rich tones of her voice startled his revery in front of her portrait. If he had felt it then, dis-- liking her, he had felt it far more powerfully after that mo-  mentous journey, when the full controlling power in her had extended its unconscious influence to him. Perhaps, learning this, had he retained his first impression of her, he had fought it down with the cool dominant resolution that had always   IN A CRUCIBLE.         293 characterized him; but he had learned to hold her at a far dif- ferent estimate. Approving her, he permitted himself to love her; and, loving her, was prepared to win her at all hazards. v He had, at this time, no other prominent aim in life. All idea of attaining place and position had forsaken him; yet the smothered passion of his nature, awakening to a life vivid and intense while yet in the prime of manhood, made an in-- terest which he thought it no shame to cherish. He had held many aims in his life: never an unworthy one! He had cherished a firm faith in their several successes, until the bit- terness of failure wrung a reluctant avowal from him; yet he had, with the innate force of true manhood, again and again rebuilt, upon fallen fabrics, some plan, without which to live was not life, in his eyes! He did not deem his love for this woman a trivial or unworthy aim, though it succeeded to others wider and more engrossing. They were beyond the pale of his desires now, as was the remotest probability of success, had he cherished them. For the present he was to give himself up to what was of present importance; and, having won her, the future might yield a field in which to hew out something worthy of himself and her! So he sat thinking, one summer evening, holding in his hand a square of cardboard on-which was written, in Parolet's firm hand: "Will you come to me, at the old place; and re- deem the promise you made me at parting'! I need your counsel and advice." It was a move she would scarcely have ventured upon, had she known all; but she did not. She had no idea that her faultless statue had warmed into life; that the glow of passion she had once hoped to see in those cold eyes had sprung to life at her bidding. 'Having despatched her summons, she felt quite sure he would come; and in a manner, she was thinking of him, as she lay back in her dis- mantled drawing-room; yet they were by no means such thoughts as had warmed his heart thinking of her-not such   294         WIX A CRUCIBLE. thoughts as were working in his mind, as he strolled out in the evening light, and turned his footsteps in search of her, Her work required a lighter dress than her ordinary heavy widow's garb; and the white floating muslin made a pretty bit of light as she rose from her lounging attitude and came forward to meet him. He had paused to take a longer look, as she sat there, unconscious for a few moments of his pres. ence. She generally sat in an arm-chair. She liked to droop her face softly in outline on her bent armn and hand; she liked the fitting her curves to its breadth and shadow. She was not without feminine vanity: few women are, who have where. with to be vain of; yet her grace and her attitudes were not studied or forced. She instinctively settled to what was most becoming, in all she did; and so far, art is admirable in woman. It is only failure to attain the end aimed at, that makes the absurdity of a woman's desire to render herself attractive!  She saw him, and on the instant rose, with that undulating grace peculiar to her, moving toward him swiftly, but becom- ingly, though she hazarded much in making her way through piles of books, papers, and disordered furniture. "Will you sit?" she said, pushing an ottoman toward him, after a look, and a slight pressure of the hand. She could not guess, looking into the quiet, impressive face, how that touch had thrilled him; nor, looking away on the instant, had she seen the transient flush of emotion that, for the first time in his life, created a sense of embarrassment. She had been the one moved, at their parting; but their -positions seemed reversed now.  She was not coveting excitement. There had been enough in her past life to render it unpalat- able. He had been better pleased had he seen some token in her of a desire to suppress emotion - some evidence, however slight, of his power to move her. But there was none; and   IN A. CRUCIBLE.        295 he was too cautious, and too proud, to risk a betrayal of his own feelings at this early stage. "You have altered," she said, after a moment's pause; looking at him the while wlth that quiet concern in her coun- tenance which a -woman rarely vouchsafes to the man she loves. Reginald winced under it. When a man loves late in life, not having frittered away all freshness of feeling upon novelties of the other sex, it is matter of more than trivial moment to him when the object of that passion seems indifferent; nor, having a strong sense that he is offering his best, has he a mind to put it upon the level of boyish passion, lightly won, lightly held, lightly parted with. Had Parolet been the veriest coquette, instead of the earnest woman she was, she could hardly have done anything that would so have enhanced her value in Reginald's eyes. There were many memories to sadden her--to make her an earnest woman; and among these memories, many re- solves: none among them more earnest than to put self out of mind. All this had its bearing upon her character, and made her worthier, more worth caring for, as she put herself in a world of thought and action that severed her from any possibility of happiness. Marriage was a contingency that had not often forced itself upon the busy mind of Reginald Moreton. He had entertained a vague idea that one day the act would become suitable, amid the ambitions and anxie- ties of his career; and when the suitableness presented itself, he would marry; making some woman his wife who need not beguile him from things of graver importance: one whom he could trust entirely, and who would be a desirable mother ;o his children. He would be proud of her too as a true, ovable, gentle woman, who would make a bright spot in his svenings at home, and never harass him with cares unsuited Jo her sex. Such had been his thought, if he could be said o have thought at all on the matter; yet when he found ".*  .'   296        . IN A CRUCIBLE,            D himself loving this self-reliant, strong-hearted woman, he never questioned his passion, more than he had his ambitions. He was loving her, too, not tamely, or composedly, but hotly and eagerly; wanting to claim her in his impatience, which, if not patent to her, he made little attempt to conceal. The impassioned face upon which he gazed, with its swift transitions so wonderfully fascinating, so far more attractive than ordinary beauty, was one which any man might be for. given for looking upon with a longing covetousness to make it his own. Yet she had learned to chill such enthusiastic longings with 'the absent gaze of a pair of eyes into which all possible meanings were gathered, save one. She had not quenched or smothered it. She had worn it out by a wider and nobler plan of life, systemized until selfish repinings and selfish desires died out naturally, almost painlessly. She was far from perfect; but she had learned to value life as the means to a great end, and to value herself only as she rose to meet enforced tests. Reginald had, as she had said, changed. The bronzed and heavily bearded face was a shade more im- pressive; the keenness and coldness of intellect less apparent, though it had given place to something ifar more attractive: there was'still a lack of warmth in the face, for the eyes, wonderfully defective as reflectors, expressed none, and the mouth was too heavily veiled by the tawny mustache and beard to express anything. The poise of the finely moulded head had lost nothing of its grandeur, and the hands, deli- cate and tapering like a woman's, were bronzed, but not mis- shapen by the service. On the whole, he had gained, Parolet thought; and so she told him, in her flexible voice with its undertone of enthusiasm, that'always made speech a danger- ous experiment with her. He was not insensible to the flat- tery it conveyed, as he sat opposite her, thinking how in keeping the voice was with the face-how full of variety the latter was, which, chan' lg even from hour to hour, was never "1      IN A CRUCIBLE.         297 beautiful, but something better, and more to his taste, and to most men's. He was farther than ever from any thought of relinquishing her after the first half-hour when he sat quietly listening to her plans. "I shall not give up my home," she said; " there are morti- fications enough in my life, without that.. It is always easier to run into extremes, and these are just what I am trying to guard against.  You can understand that it would-be easier for me to drop quietly out of the world, than to remain where there'will be that constant call for small sacrifices. I turned cowardly once, thinking of the wearisome monotony of small things: it is very easy to be a grand soul, Mr. Moreton; very hard to bring one's self to small ends-to be a little one, even when one has the end clearly before one, and it is not before me." Then she sat with her head thrown back, and just a short flutter through her closed lips, that showed what the struggle had been. It was a new school of Art, that expressed the pain and the strain of a conflict in the repose of marble. There was that in the woman, as she sat motionless after her speech, that brought out this idea in its full perfection to Reginald, as he sat watching her. "You say nothing," she said, turning toward him; "have you no counsel, no reproof?" He smiled: "There can be no objection to your plan of life, if it stand the proof. Are you quite sure of yourself? Yours is scarcely the fibre from which little souls are made." The half smile that fluttered on his lip always looked like irony, when you saw how little the eye participated. "A fail- ure to live out the little life would not help the cause much." "You have not counted upon that for yourself," she said, impatiently. "I am not made of your fibre: you are all nerves; two hours' converse' in society seems to exhaust some necessary 13* "   --2988         IN A CRUCIBLE. element of your being. I am not physician enough to say what; but the hieroglyphics are not to be mistaken -pallid cheeks, and lack-lustre eyes, 'sicklied o'er,' not with 'the pale cast of thought,' but by the utter depression of animal forces. You are a riddle, harder to read than the far-famed Sphynx: where shall an (Edipus be found? I am not content," he added, changing his tone, "to see you adopt a life so discord- ant to your nature, unless I can see in what it is to be of ma- terial benefit to others. Why deprive yourself of all that might seem compensation for a very hard lot?" "You are very kind to think of it in that light; but I must think for, not of myself. The pleasantest life for me now, were I mapping out one, would be perfect quiet and rest, and a little time to myself for reading and study; but I have brought myself to feel that I have no right to consult my own pleasure. I must bear my share of the little frets of society, simply because they are repugnant: -perhaps some other feeling will intervene in time. Anything that seems easy, is a warning in itself. The only religion I can ever take hold upon is something of this healthy kind; some- thing that begins in practice, and with which sentiment has little to do, unless it be to fight the battle with conscience." "Then you have quite made up your mind to live for others? A thankless task, let me warn you!" "Not quite, I imagine. What becomes, too, of conscience? It is very much a matter of cultivation: mine will no longer permit me tp take pleasure in selfish indulgences. - I may be, after all, considering myself too much: only present interest has so little to do with it, that it seemed worthier than the old life." She ended with a little droop in the voice that sounded like discouragement to Reginald's quick sense. She -was doubting her motives. She seemed a very humble, if a self- asserting woman! %9    i   IN A CRUCIBLE.         299 "If this is all, it is better than I had hoped for," he said, after a pause. "I generally mistrust a woman's plans. They set out on too high a strain, and are apt to break gait before the mile is won. It is promising, that you have on hand no scheme for a convent or charity school." "Lady abbess would be some credit," she said, archly. "As- to charity children, you are not far wrong; though there is to be nothing of the stereotyped pattern- poor little mor- tals! who must wear monotonous blue pinafores, and recite set speeches to me, as lady patroness: no tea and cakes for good behavior and perfect Sunday lessons." "You are not bent, either, upon parting with more than the half of your fortune, if I understand you aright. Quite enough, considering there is no law which could bind you to the fulfilment of your promise." "No law but that of conscience and honor," she said, gravely. "Some do not believe in retributive justice; but I think conscience becomes the avenger, and metes out punish- ment -not condign vengeance, such as I might mete to my unfortunate charity children; but I do believe that whenever, in the smallest particular, we deviate from our own standard, we suffer for it. I am not chivalrous or sentimental; I shall do what is right by this girl--but no more. I shall not com- pound for forgiveness for any sins committed or premeditated, by romantic and uncalled-for generosity toward one whom I have not sinned against." "A meek and quiet spirit shall be your 'adornment,'" he said, with a provoking smile. "A truce to banter: listen to my plan; and reserve your raillery for that. I am not fond of society; or, perhaps, it would be more honest to say that society is not fond of me. However that may be, the relinquishment of a fortune will not incommode me. I will reserve sufficient for a comfort- able maintenance. The rest I desire to appropriate to the   800        TIX A ctCrULtE. education of Southern white children, whose parents are unable to pay for it. The public schools throughout the country have been closed since the war; and while the Gov- ernment has made every provision for colored schools, the white children are growing up in utter ignorance. This argues ill for the future political history of the country; and I am not narrow-minded enough to rejoice in what must work effects so deplorable." She paused. His face was grave and attentive, but approv- ing, and she resumed: "True, my means are limited, but, so far as they go, I shall use them for the establishment of a free school, and the em- ployment of efficient teachers; the latter to be selected among Southern women left destitute by the loss of relatives in the Southern army. This will give to many cultivated women means of honorable livelihood. Men can always find em- ployment when they like; there are but few openings for women. . I have a vacant lot for my purpose, in the village of St. Bevins, and the school fund I wish placed in trust- worthy hands, to be used independently of my control. Wo- men rarely understand business; and I would prefer having nothing personally to do with it, beyond the selection of the teachers, and the privilege of discharging them should they prove unfit. Do you approve?" she questioned, bending her bright, earnest face toward him. "Approve it? Most assuredly! It is nobly thought--it will be nobly rewarded. I expected nothing half so good. I will gladly forward your attempt." "Thank you," she said, simply. -After a further discussion of her "plan," which she had mapped out with a precision and clearness that did credit to the business capacity she had disclaimed, she said: "And the  other -matter- when will you have the papers ready for my signature?"   IN A CRUCIBLE.         301 Reginald had an unconquerable repugnance to women who founded the alpha and omega of existence upon a selfish passion, and ignored any plan of life which might comprise some of the requirements of the decalogue. He had far less faith in such unhealthy sentiment than a less observant student of human nature might. The healthy, vigorous tone of Parolet was somewhat of a discouragement, without her very palpable forgetfulness of their mutual positions. He did not commend her because she had won his entire appro- bation; but he managed to convey some such assurance, as they rose after her last speech and came forward into the front drawing-room. Outside, the sunlight yet lay warm in the west; but they stood in semi-twilight, her simple wrapper tracing the white outline of her figure. "You will not delay," she said, again. "I have business which will take me again to New York, as soon as I can arrange matters here." He made the required promise before he unclasped the little hand he held: then he went down the street, the orange light shining on his bronzed face. And the woman's eyes were shining with a radiance that was not caught from the west. She stood there until the light hiad quite faded out; then she turned back, going into the littered room, and stumbling over the articles that lay scattered about. She never sat long in the dark--she could not think well: it seemed to pall her senses and stifle her. She made the rooms brilliant; then fell to her musing in the arm-chair, with one slender hand falling over it, and a rounded arm thrown up over her head. After a little she rose swiftly, went to her cabinet at the farther end of the room, and retiring thence, sat down again under the lights. She spread a bit of crumpled paper out on  her knee, read it slowly and carefully, her eyes lighting, and her lips moving impetuously.   302         IN A CRUCIBLE. "Does he question the balance now? How angry it made me!" she said, smiling on the bit of paper, as it lay on her lap. "And now-he likes me!"She said this very slowly and softly, rubbing her finger absently on her lip; "and I-" The sentence was never finished, unless the eyes took it up; and they grew from brilliant to weary with wonderful celerity after that half-finished sentence.   CHAPTER XXXT. IN WHCH A PUNTER MAKES HS SECOND PAROLET, AND - LOSES!- "When the pale moonbeam On tower and stream Sheds a flood of silver sheen, How I love to gaze As the cold ray strays O'er thy face, my heart's throned queen." PAROLET did not leave so soon as she had intended. There was some delay in arranging the business which Reginald had in hand, and more than a month elapsed before he brought her the deeds which required her signature; a month, through which Reginald had come and gone, sometimes hold- ing interviews with her in the sunny morning-room. It was unchanged as of old, save that, if possible, it nearer resem- bled the Paradise she had named it, since she now ruled, an unfettered Eve, happy in her solitude; nor was he yet minded to enter on his office of tempter. It was too great a happi- ness to be allowed free access to her, to see her in all her various moods. In her turn, his placidity pleased her; she liked to have this quiet, cool man come to her in her solitude and impress his grave characteristics upon her. They suited each other mutually. He liked her active mind, her unflagging energy, her industry, her candor and vanity, her truthfulness and freedom of speech. He liked to sit quietly watching her little feminine ways- a woman neat and careful, with a housewifely tact before which confusion vanished and order came out of chaos; one whose'household appointments, how- 303   304         IN A CRUCIBLE., ever plain, seemed to take the hue of her own grace and re. finement. She was not a profuse or-wearisome talker. Her thoughts were good, and clearly conveyed. She often lapsed into silences; yet even then, the play of her expressive fea- tures furnished scarce a lesser delight. But he was not allowed more of such interviews than pru- dence permitted. Many of his visits had been passed in the drawing-rooms, which, no longer filled with guests, were open to a much more tiresome inroad of morning and afternoon visitors. He could but admire her here. He knew, if her guests did not, what that monotonous dribble of small com- monplace cost her. He saw, with some quiet relish, the red flush of suppressed vexation and annoyance, and heard the unctious tone in which she lent point to very tiresome speeches; taking the burden of their dulness as much upon herself as possible, to compensate for the not very complimentary things she was thinking of them. He liked to see her lifting their little burdens, while she called up a courage rarely wanting, and went over the ground daily, he knew, though he was not always of her audience. It was not a matter of marvel that, with his nice sense, and his freedom from little- ness, he learned to love her. - He had, by this time, however, decided to withhold such knowledge from her, unless sure of success. He was very near making this fatal mistake as he stood by her, going over the deed she was to sign in a few moments. It is an easy thing to underrate deeds: easier than to over- rate them; yet I think I am not falling into the latter error when I say I think with Reginald that this woman was about to do a very noble thing. There was no enthusiasm to sus- tain her in the act; and while in theory it seems a simple thing, the man, or woman, who, from a pure sense of right, with no legal, or even, strictly speaking, moral obligation to bind them, takes pen in hand to sign away the half of their   IN A CRUCIBLE.         305 fortune, does a very courageous thing. There was no con- sciousness in her manner, nothing of bravado. She stood at his side, her face a little inclined, rather grave and thoughtful. When he had finished the reading, she held the pen for an instant suspended, then quietly and deliberately traced her autograph. The characters were clear and dis- tinct. He had seen many women's signatures, never twice written alike: Parolet's never varied in a line or curve, and finished with a bold flourish, somewhat as a man's might, affixing his name to a public document. If caligraphy were any sign, this woman might be safely trusted to attend to her own affairs; and the sense of her fitness for such -an office did not strike Reginald very pleasantly at this particular moment. "Now," she said, after a moment's pause, "I must bid you adieu. My departure has only been delayed by this business; and I have fixed no time for my return." She extended her hand., He held it, clasping it with both his own. It was a firm, gentle clasp, drawing her a step nearer; but again the man's purpose failed before the eyes she turned upon him. They were so friendly, so unclouded, so free from the shy, tremulous pleasure that should have veiled them from his gaze. Involuntarily, he released his grasp. Had he watched her then, -as closely as he had but a moment before, he would have seen the short flutter of relief that stirred the sensitive lips. She had not liked that warm, tremulous clasp on her hands, nor the involuntary motion she had made toward him: she liked still less the sort of influence this maa:,eemed to exercise -over her at will. She did not love lria:' she deter- mined the passion he felt for her should never find utterance. If her manner was sometimes provocative, it could be equally repellant on occasion. He walked toward the window, standing a moment silent,   806         IN A. CRUCIBLE. listening to the jarring voices below, and summing up the measure of happiness she was snatching so ruthlessly from him. He felt a little vindictive, too, seeing her, as he turned around once more, standing so calmly where he had left her, her hand resting on the table, the sweet seriousness he best loved making the face one he was not likely to put out of mind. "You will write?" he questioned, as he gathered up his papers. "Not unless business require it." Check number two. He took up his hat, hesitated, and wondered if he should venture a third; then he said: "We shall not meet again soon: will you give me a few pleasant hours with you? The evening is delightful; come to the Square and enjoy it." Seeing her hesitate, he added: "You will not refuse me anything so slight. What has be- come of our compact?"            - "No," she said, slowly; "it is a slight request, and we may not meet again. I will go." He walked back to the window, and awaited her coming. When'they entered the street he walked at her side, quiet and thoughtful. He was not quite satisfied that, he had done wisely in trusting himself with her; but grew more assured as he saw the face wearing its unconscious expression, and eyes taking thoughtful farewell of familiar scenes. Trees bare and leafless reared their gaunt limbs against the autumn sky; the long grass lay brown and russeT beneath their feet; but the rich green foliage of the shrubberies invited the eye, and they seated themselves on a bench facing the cathedral. It was one of those delicious autumn evenings known to all Louisianians, when not more than a breath stirs its ripple on the water; when soft purple clouds lie low on the horizon, and fleecy vapors float overhead, causing that alternation of light and shadow, that wavering of the landscape that sets all one's   IN A CRUCIBLE.         807 pulses throbbing with languid enjoyment. High in mellow : light rose the tall spires of the cathedral, while all the long rows of diamond panes glittered with topaz light. "Is it not beautiful?" said Parolet, softly. "There' is A charm to me in this portion of the city, which belongs to no other. No inconsistencies of architecture offend the taste. Those old court-buildings, with their broad flat windows and miniature domes, are strictly in keeping with the ancient dwellings of this Moorish quarter; and until very recently it had resisted encroachment. The Square might be made hand- somer, but to my taste scarcely more picturesque, or more poetical, if we dwell, as we rarely fail to do, upon the asso- ciations which that venerable pile of quaint architecture arouses. The Moor, the Spaniard, the French--to each in turn we have been indebted for some halo of romance which, while such outward evidence of nationality remain, cannot perish. There has been much talk of tearing down these buildings to erect handsomer and more modern ones. See what Vandalism has already done for our time-honored cathe- dral. Yet it was essentially an Americanism. The eye, in this country, is everywhere offended by anachronisms in architecture: Gothic roofs on Canadian villas; Moorish foun- tains, and Grecian temples, grouped without reference to time, place, or adaptation." "I agree with- you in regretting any innovations here. There is so little of the antique and venerable to which our country can lay claim, that we should give it a just value. Every Orleannois should revere these buildings." "And do they not?" said Parolet. "Ah! I love the old French town- its smoke, its quaint red-tiled roofs, so stub- born in its nationality. The new town savors too strongly of Yankee-land, for my taste. I come here to remind my- self of what has been - there, one is constantly reminded of what is."   308         IN A CRUCIBLE.  "You are not Mussulman enough to think that' whatever is is right,'" said her companion, smiling. ' You do not cry ' Kismit,' and submit, nor I; yet I think your French romance must give way before Anglo-Saxon energy." "The French are a great people," said Parolet. "No nation ever gave birth to so much female celebrity." "Umph!" said her companion, dubiously; "you admire French writers- female writers?" "Assuredly; do not you? Where in all the world will you find a De Stael- a Dudevant?" "The former I grant you." "Surely you would not deny the latter power?" "Not power, perhaps; but a power so misdirected does not seem a matter of much congratulation." She remained silent. "Well?" he questioned. "Well," she retorted; "we do not agree. Why shock you' by the expression of opinion?" "I am not easily shocked," he said, smiling at her vexation. "Your opinions so frankly given to those who cannot or will not understand them, sometimes annoy me; but I think you may trust my good-will, if not my comprehension." "Then I will be honest, and say that, for power analyt- ical power-no female writer ever equalled her. De Stael's writings are unsatisfying. One feels a yoid that should have been filled by the heart of the woman. Perhaps we make the mistake of searching for the nature of woman in all that emanates from her pen; certainly such deficiency rarely strikes in the works of men. - We desire great grasp of in- tellect, and are never disappointed if that desire is fulfilled. One feels, in reading Dudevant, that the life of the woman suffered from all she deprecates, and gained in all she adyo-  cates. It has always seemed to me she wrote more from the large cravings of her nature than from any desire for fame;   IN A CRUCIBLE.         809 nor do we see any of that petty craving for opinion that is so evident in De Stael and Ossoli.. I grow impatient under trite criticisms of great authors - French authors, particularly- who are all artists in their work. Who reads their works ignorantly, deserves to be impaled." Shq paused, but, gaining no reply, added, pettishy: "But why discuss female authorship with you, who deny her powers of penmanship?" "Not I; you are all wrong. I admire Charlotte Brontd exceedingly.! 'She is a fine writer, without pedantry, but with unmistakable nerve and force. De Stael had intellect, but, as you say, no heart - Dudevant no morality; and an unsexed woman has no beauty for man. Remember that we are easily won by gentleness and strength of character in woman, whether she be author or not: we are only repelled by pedantic display, and an assumption of the peculiarities of our own sex." After a moment she said: "There can be no higher ambi- tion than to be ji true woman; but I think your sex often make the mistake of confounding insipidity with amiability, and a want of character with gentleness." She turned to him a face with no lack of gentleness; with only the touching droop of the mouth that always moved him strongly, and with a pair of eyes so eloquent with feeling that silence seemed the only thing left him. The twilight had come softly down, and through the gathering darkness they rose and re-entered the street. The foreign jargon; the moving figures on the narrow side- walks; the glimmer of the lamps, as, one by one, the tongues of jet sprang up before them, were familiar sights and sounds to Parolet; and nothing in her travels had ever seemed half so attractive to her as the brilliant shops, when they turned into Charter Street, and crossed Canal. Interwoven with her love of country, were strong local attachments that made her I   IN A CRUCIBLE.  cling jealously to home scenes and home surroundings. Over head was a dewy sky, with dark-blue enamelling, crusted with starry gems:   " Mellower moons and softer skies, larger constellations burning." Reginald was not insensible to the emotions his compan. ion's face expressed; and when she turned on the doorstep, he raised the little hand to his tremulous lips, and his eyes sought hers, darkening with a man's infectious passion. "Parolet," he whispered, eagerly-"Parolet, why leave me ? Let me -" But she had snatched her hand from that warm clasp, and in a moment he stood alone on the doorstep in the moonlight, half vexed, and not a little pleased. She had not fled him unless doubtful of herself; and he turned and went down the street with head erect, and the prescience of victory upon him. Parolet had gained her room, where the moonlight entered through the lace-curtained window and lay in a broad patch of white light on the carpet. She drooped her face softly on her hands and lay there, while she silently condemned her- self. What had she to do with love? And yet, and yet - the frail heart of the woman was rising up rebelliously. She must leave this, at once: must see him no more. Another week, and she would be in New York. She had liked it once: now - every pulse of its great, living arteries was an insult, and an outrage to her beloved Southern country; yet she was bidding a long farewell to New Orleans, as she leaned from her window: spires and masts loomed faintly through the mists, now curling softly upward, and she whispered her tearful adieu to "the land we love."  CHAPTER XXXTT. A NIGHT VIGIL.   "Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids blue, And her mouth's red and heavy rose all through Seemed sad with glad things gone." Swinburne. PAROLET had felt some misgiving, when she placed her young charge in the hands of Mrs. Western, and that mis- giving had not ceased to haunt her on her return home. She felt that her duty did not end here. The selection of Arthur's brother clergyman had not seemed to her the wisest, under the circumstances. Mrs. Western was the customary type, however, of women selected. to exercise the office of gouver- nante to refractory subjects; the ample chin and lap giving one a sense of motherliness, the unvarying placidity of coun- tenance offering a soothing sense of monotony to the soul of sinful unrest: a woman whose few frailties had been put out of mind with the days of youth, and who, welcoming the quiet and seclusion of her modest life of charities, saw no reason why the "path of peace" to her feet, should not be " ways of pleasantness " to her young charge. A wise choice, most men would have thought, seeing the placid content written in a pair of very unmeaning blue eyes, and her scrupulous neatness of garb; but women know more about these things. They go below the surface in judging of their own sex, and are apt to draw wiser conclusions. She was not the woman to have charge of this passionate, unrestful little girl: of this Parolet was quite sure I Having little to say to Susan on her voyage, she had studied her keenly and closely, with the jealous eyes of a 311  312         IN A CRUCIBLE. wronged woman, but with the quick intelligence of a very clear-headed one. She saw how little the sense of wrong. doing weighed upon her: how little she was likely to wel. come the quiet monotony of a penitent's life. The deceptive brightness of the countenance did not win her to any belief in mind or intelligence. The petulant pouting of the lips, the quick gesture of the little sun-crowned head, betrayed the nature but too plainly. She was only safe for the pres. ent in her misfortune: one which evoked some very unruly tears in her frightened isolation from familiar scenes and faces. A pitiable sight, one might think; but Parolet was not troubling herself with the office of comforter. She had her own feelings to combat; and the childish idea of punish- ment for what seemed to the offender but a childish misde- meanor, rather elicited contempt than pity. She was think- ing very bitter things, and a strong feeling had prompted her to utter them, as they sat on deck one night, the blue waves of the Atlantic rolling but a few feet below them, the deck echoing around them with the monotonous trampling of feet, the discordant jarring of human voices. It was a sound from which she shrank involuntarily. How pitiless, how merci- less human beings were! How much kinder death seemed to- one struggling under the burden of sin and shame! She thought this, looking into the water below, dark under the shadow of the ship's side-flooded beyond with silvery light. She thought how far sooner she would seek oblivion in those unfathomable waters, rather than live, a thing of scorn among men--a scoff and a hopeless outcast among women  She laid a compelling hand on the child's arm, and forced her unwilling eyes to follow the direction of her own. "Have you ever thought of death, as an escape from shame?" she whispered. One scared glance out of the violet eyes, and Parolet never forgot the shiver of a dire distress that convulsed the little   IN A CRUCIBLE.         313 frame, the white pallor of the thin face, or the violent force with which she wrenched herself free of her detaining hand. "I am afraid to die," she gasped; and it was no feigned terror: no feigned love of life, either, that had made her stretch her young arms out over the bright waters, when the golden light of day flashed over waves of burnished gold, or that broke in a glad cry of delight from the impetuous little lips, at the unaccustomed sight. From that hour Parolet ceased to despise this little soul, so tremulous before a dread unknown which she could not comprehend, yet waking to light and loveliness like the flowers that God had in his keeping. Misgivings had crowded on her mind, as she made her second and solitary journey, whether she had not left her already too long to herself and the non-guidance of her feeble- minded protectress. It was not unlikely that, wearied of the monotony of her life, and panting with unrestful desires for variety, Susan would throw over her protector, and follow a life more to her taste. The disappearance of his charge would bring Arthur Moreton to grief, and fill her with a host of remorseful regrets. No misgivings of such a nature entered into the perfect rest of Mrs. Western, or disturbed the smooth current of her mental placidity on that summer evening when Parolet stood an observant onlooker of the scene before her: a group for the pencil of Watteau, which even the ample figure -of Mrs. Western, just within the doorway, failed to mar. Susan sat on the low doorstep under the cottage ornie; the sunlight full on her golden head, a little bent: the knees were slightly raised to support her child-- a laughing Bacchus, full of sportive life, his mouth stained with milk from the breast, just withdrawn, and yet within reach of the eager little lips. Even at that distance she could see the pleasure- flush on the delicate oval cheek, the fine proportion of the "   314         IN A CRUCIBLE. uncovered breast, marbled over with blue tracery, the soften. ing curves of the mother's face, as she bent over the laughing boy. The pang of unspeakable things came into the face of the gazer I! She did not move; she could not break in upon such a scene: not now, at least; and she waited, straining her eyes after the mother and child, even when the former rose suddenly, and placing the boy on the door-mat, came back to her seat, and dropped her chin on her hand. The infant lay quiet, crowing in the contentment of plenty, and Parolet let her eyes follow the mother. She sat quite still in the rich light, the full sleeves falling away from the rounded arms as she propped them on her knee. It was a retired spot, with only a faint hum of the noisy thoroughfares!bearing up on the evening air, and a sweet odor from the little garden lingering about and perfuming the atmosphere. There were little shadows of restlessness and discontent on the face now turned away from her child, that did not escape the observant eyes of the other woman: sha- dows that had settled deeper as the moments fled, making a little droop of intense weariness about the mouth, and the glitter of a dangerous longing in the violet eyes. Once or twice she shook her head impatiently in the direction of Mrs. Western's clicking needles. The light began to die away in the west, and Mrs. Western sat sleeping in her ,chair; the busy needles lay on her lap, her fat hands crossed, her ample chin buried on her still more ample bosom. It was full of the milk of human kindness; but Susan bestowed a very wicked look on the unconscious sleeper, as she rose and stole softly toward her child. He was sleeping quietly on the mat -where she had laid him, and, after a moment's hesitation, she gathered him in her arms, nestled the little cheek to her own, and passed under the doorway. She had no very strong maternal instincts, would never be capable of any great sacrifices; and this little one was pro.   IN A CRUCIBLE.         315 bably dearer to her now, when the fountain of his sustenance yet welled warmly in her bosom. She was growing tired f his restraints already, and was thinking, as she laid hinmna his bed, that, if it were not for him, she would run away and go back to Phillis: Phillis who, with all her untidiness and her fierce passions, was more to her taste than the feeble in- anity outside, who aroused all her vindictive hate. There was not a thought toward her child of loving self-sacrifice cheerfully assumed, even while she bent over -him and the tired little eyes opened a moment sleepily upon her. She was wearying for the time when he would no longer be a re- straint upon her movements. She came out again, down the walk, with a wrapping over her head, and stood at the gate, leaning listlessly on the rail- ing. . Her face deepened in intensity as the clang of a neigh- boring chapel-bell smote the air heavily. When it diipd away, she fell to trembling,. then threw herself on the grass, sobbing passionately. Something in the sound had awakened her to a sense of her loneliness. She thought what a journey lay between herself and her home- of how impossible it was she should ever reach it alone and unaided. The cruelty of thus separating her, of driving her into exile, struck her with bitter force as she lay writhing in childish pain. She was clenching her little hands in impotent fury, and menacing her oppressors; she was forming desperate resolutions, which she would never find courage to follow out. After a few moments of passionate sobbing and wrathful ejaculations, that seemed too childish to be terrible, even though the -ebullition of a fearful anger, in a thing so slight, she sprang suddenly to her feet, and laid her hand on the gate. It was locked, and she shook, it angrily. It was a slight barrier to the lithe figure accustomed to the free exer- cises of a couintry life. She laid her hand on the top, placed her foot between the bars, and swung herself lightly over it.   816         lN A CRUCIBLE. For an instant she stood in the street, hesitating which direc. tion to take. On one side she heard the ceaseless roar of the city-on the other, she knew, lay the river, a few hundred yards away. "The river!" she muttered fiercely; "the river, that I have not heard in so long. Think of the meanness of :shut- ting me up in a city!" She clasped her small hands together, holding her shawl tightly between them, and ran swiftly down the street, Parolet following at a more leisurely pace. What a sense of freedom was hers as she sped away in the twilight, and gained the river bank! She was inured to all country exercises; could handle an oar with grace, skill, and fearless- ness, and had a mad purpose to go out on the river if she could find a boat. She soon gave up the search, finding none she could handle, and lay there looking up at the sky over- head, and wishing she was dead. Not that she had any in- tent to die by her own hand: she was too cowardly for that; only, living seemed a great pain now, when her baby was not needing her. Parolet never wearied of her vigil until she liad seen her charge home once more - seen her flit past Mrs. Western, startling her out of her nap, and answering nothing to her sleepy, frightened questionings. Then she had followed her quietly to her room, where she had thrown herself down by her child's cradle, her small white face pale and ghost- like from passion, and clenched white fingers clasping his sleeping form. She laid a firm, quiet hand on Susan's shoulder. "You are to leave this to-morrow: do you under- stand? To go with me: to have a friend. I have been near you all the evening. I shall keep my word; so no more scenes and pantomimes. When you want change, tell me so, and you shall have it." l The girl rose to her feet- on the instant -stood staring at Parolet in a confused way, holding her glittering hair away from her small face in both hands. The golden mesh fell   IN A CRUCIBLE.         o17 about her, enveloping her diminutive, unwomanly form, and making passion seem ludicrous in an object so small. Passion to inspire respect or awe must be dignified: hers was only childish. When the full meaning of the words she had listened to in her startled confusion burst upon her, she sprang to Parolet's feet, sobbing out grateful tears, and wrapping her lithe arms about her in an enthusiasm by no means pleasing to the object of it. She was not' easily checked. She was quite ready to dance now, in her joy and excitement; and flitted about between Parolet and the child's cradle, in a manner that. argued ill for her following the injunction of her benefactress, to "go to bed, and to sleep." Seeing her by no means inclined to obey, Parolet left her, going quickly down stairs, holding a few moments' converse with Mrs. Western, and then out of the house. She was not long in reaching her lodgings, -and thought, as she undressed and lay down, how much longer life seemed than it had a few hours previous. She had laid another burden upon her-. self. She was no longer unfettered; the old trammels were to be worn again. She gave a sigh to her lost freedom; but she had not acted under excitement, and there was no reac- tion as she lay there thinking of her responsibility, and feel- ing that she could not conscientiously have done otherwise. The girl had gone home that night, but would she the second, or third? Then she thought what a passionate, unwomanly little thing it was, and sighed for her own lost rest and quietude. She meant to be quite up to her promise, but it was not an easy or a pleasant thing to right a wrong com- mitted by another, and that other-her husband!    CHAPTER XXXIII. A CHANCE RENCOUNTER. "I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And when two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury: Though little fire grow great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all: So I to her, and so she yields to me; For I am rough, and woo not like a babe." Shakcspeare. IT was difficult to say how Parolet wore through the long- hot months of that summer in New York.   Never losing sight of her charge, she was fain to confess great vexation and weariness of spirit. Chained to the city, Susan grew rest- less, petulant, as the dust and noise and heat ruffled a tem- -per never serene. She had often left her child to Mrs. Western and its own devices, while she pleased her taste for variety; roaming out stealthily when that good woman be- lieved her safe within the limits of her little garden. All that was over now. Parolet had, from the first, evinced a strong repugnance to the child, and Susan - fretted under the burden of his continual care. She held Parolet in too much awe to indulge her migratory habitf, and was too true to her artful instincts to incur the displeasure of her only friend. Yet, after the first ebullition of her childish gratitude, she had felt toward her benefactress only dislike, and a sense of timid constraint. This grave, quiet woman, who had consti- tuted herself her guardian, inspired her with a dislike only a little less vivid than she had felt for good Mrs. Western. She was not of a grateful nature.  She was incapable of un- derstanding the sacrifices of others toward herself: incapable 318  -   IN A CRUCIBLE.         319 of seeing in what her want of character aroused contempt. Tiring of books, pouting over the slight tasks assigned her - by turns sullen, mischievous, unfeeling, and passionate, the task of cultivation or improvement seemed hopeless. After a long sultry day, she sat with her work lying idly in her lap, taking up her stitches in a dawdling, slovenly manner, which did not escape Parolet, though she seemed intent on her own work. Her cheeks were flushing, and her eyes gathering the restless gleam that was usually the fore- runner of a childish outhurst. She sat curled up in her chair, striking angrily at the flies that lighted on her hands, face, and neck. Soon her child crawled to her, lifting its little fat fingers to her dress, and drawing itself up toward her, with that half-laughing, half-crowing sound so familiar toimothers. For a moment she took no notice of its appeal; then she bent quickly down, and, drawing her dress rudely from its baby clasp, pushed it from her with her foot. Thus spurned, it set up a piteous cry; but Susan only rose impatiently, throwing down her work, and, walking away to the window, stood there with her back to Parolet.       I "Come here, Susan," Mrs. Trevor said, in her quiet tone of command, which the girl had learned never to disobey. She came forward sullenly enough, her brows contracting sharply, until all the innocent purity of the childish face was blotted out. "What is it you are wanting?" questioned Parolet. "What manner of life did you expect when you came to me?" She was ashamed to tell the truth--to tell of the visions that had peopled her silly brain of the life she was to lead with Mrs. Trevor. She was rich, and a lady; and Susan re- membered places into which she had looked, pressing her little face amnong the crowd, and wondering if those brilliant scenes, all lighted with gas, with pictures and music, whirling before her enchanted vision, was the fairy-land she had read   320         IN A CRUCIBLE. of in Arthur's books. She stammered out something which her auditor at first could not understand, but which, when she did, awoke a smile on her lip. A trip up the Hudson set her longings in a healthier direc. tion. There, in the purple hills, with the white mists rolling softly at their feet, and the river winding along its picturesque length, the fair face softened into loveliness, the restlessness subdued, when Nature laid a cool hand on the fevered pulses and whispered- rest! One Pesthetic touch, scarce defined, yet true, drew them together here; and Parolet, watching her, fair and soft; with her baby at her breast, learned to think less bitterly, if not more forgivingly, of her husband. Yet she was not drawn to her, either to love or to caress. Beau- tiful, with her delicate coloring, the pliant moulding of the limbs, the lithe grace of the small form, the exquisite and deceptive toning of the features and expression into some semblance of an inborn purity, she failed to excite more than admiration. The sense of impurity was there, and it is one which a woman never overlooks.  Seeing all this, you will realize how hardly Parolet was tested, later on. No feeling of pity or affection had stolen in to soften her toward this girl. There was nothing to plead for her in the woman's heart: how much to be reckoned against her! It was a brilliant sunset that bathed the western sky on a Sabbath evening toward the close of summer, and the air vibrated with the strokes of clanging church-bells. Both stood under the dusky arch of solemn old Trinity, while the light lay warm on its tower, and the crowd passed softly up the aisle. When the noise ceased, Parolet saw that her com- -panion had disappeared, and, with her child in her arms, was kneeling in one of the side pews. She looked for a moment at the kneeling figure, rather sadly thinking, that house of prayer, of how unfit the spirit that dwelt in a temple so pure! She did not feel just in the mood for church-going,   IN A CRUCIBLE.         321 and stood still within the doorway a-few moments. Then she went out, and began slowly pacing down the street, struggling to put down a vague longing to go up in the tall tower, where she knew the sunlight was lying warm, though there was not much but daylight on the street; but she succumbed at last. Some of her best and strongest religious moments had been those of perfect thought and loneliness. She longed now for such quiet and solitude; and its chances were so rare! Slow- ly she began the toilsome ascent, which, once won, fulfilled its promise. She stood looking through the window into the busy street below, swarming with what seemed scarcely more than insect life, at that distance. She stood there a long time, filling her mind with the view: the clustered -cities, and shining rivers, and, over all, the purple light of the day that was dying so calmly and grandly. She was far away from small cares and frets in this altitude; but- not from a weigh- ing sense of unworthiness, of longing after a greater and better life than the present. A sense of the unfitness, the humiliations of her present life, made her turn, with a sudden and passionate regret, to that she had wilfully put from her. She bent her head until the heavy crest of bronzed hair drooped on the ponderous framework, and her eyes listlessly traced the roughly cut letters on the stained walls. A strange desire to leave some token of their presence, has everywhere led those birds of passage-- travellers-to leave, on marble or brick, char- acters which may awaken a moment's wonder or surmise. Soon, longing gave place in her mind to a simple sense of quiet and'rest and solitude; with only a faint humming from the street below, and the indistinct rumble of the organ and chant. She started from her recumbent position, when the latter ceased, and began her descent; .bettered, as she always was, by such moments. She had again reached the street, and "*   822         IN A CRUCIBLE.- stood among the waiting crowd, when her eye lighted upon a figure passing rapidly down toward the river. The face was turned away from her, but the form was unmistakable. The erect carriage and massive head could only belong to Reginald Moreton. She had not heard from him since leav- ing New Orleans-- had had no idea of his vicinity; yet here he was, in New York, within a few feet of her, and she in igno- rance of the fact. She stood, rooted to the spot until he had disappeared in the crowd: then the pang of old regrets as. sailed her keenly, blanching her eager face with a host of memories, longings, and passions. Was friendship the rock to which she must cling? How vapid and tasteless it seemed! - with ler positive thirst for the wine of some strong passion that was to bear up the bead to its surface. She looked at the throng of worshippers pouring from the church door. Were they religious and happy? she thought, scanning their faces eagerly. "Nothing left me but that," she whispered; "in all my desolation, nothing but that to turn to; and how and whence shall it come?" She was startled from her revery by hearing Reginald Moreton's name pronounced in that light tone bordering upon a sneer, then a laugh that brought the. blood tingling to her finger-tips. She turned quickly, and found herself face to face with Monsieur Philom1el Bujac. He disengaged himself from his companion, who, with a glance that way, passed on, and the Frenchman, placing himself at her side, thrust out his little gloved hand, exclaiming, "We three have met again! like the witches in Macheth. Quel plaisir!" Parolet smiled, without touching the extended hand, say- ing, "Let us hope- this meeting is not ominous. You were the bird of ill omen, and croaked of a disaster which befell us." "I have left only a bad impression on madame, then? It is my misfortune, since I have thought only of herself since." Parolet surveyed him in grave displeasure; and-was about   IN A CRUCIBLE.         323 to walk off, when she remembered her charge, still within the church, and paused suddenly. M. Bujac saw her change of purpose, and misinterpreted. "Madame is keeping an appointment?" "I am," she said, promptly, and with great coolness: . do not let me detain you." "Not at all," he said, maliciously; "it gives me great pleasure to await madame's commands." She disdained further notice, and stood, trying calmly to ignore his vicinity. There was a long pause, during which the crowd still poured forth, under the gloomy arch of old Trinity; and Parolet, seeing it grow late, cast anxious glances over the faces, seeking Susan. The latter generally lingered, with an idle curiosity, and love of crowds, exceedingly trying to Parolet: in this instance it was particularly so. "M. Moreton will not return; he is by this time on board the Brooklyn ferry," said M. Bujac, with malicious emphasis. "Will madame, wait longer?" "M. Bujac," she said, turning toward him with dignity, and with a voice tremulous with conflicting emotions, " when- ever we have met, you have seen fit to insult me. There is no protection to which I can appeal, if your sense of gentlemanly honor does not condemn such persecution of a lady." M. PhilomBl was subdued, as he always was, by a direct appeal to himself, soothing to his self-conceit. "Pardon me if I have made a meestake. I see madame on the street, evidently waiting for some one. I also see M. Moreton, her old friend and travelling companion, and I con- clude, naturally, he is the person expected." He bowed low, and hesitated, as if meekly awaiting pardon. "I know nothing of Mr. Moreton," she said, impatiently. "I did not know, until a few moments since, that he was in New York. I am waiting for a lady."   324         IN A CRUCIBLE. She began composedly tracing figures with the point of her parasol on the stones. M. Bujac eyed her intently. "Madame knows nothing of M. Moreton then- nothing recent?" There was an emphasis in the tone that, coupled with the words that had first startled her, in reference to Reginald, made her turn a quick glance upon him. "How should I?" she said, quickly; "how should I? I have been here six months or more, and in all that time have heard not one word from the South. What do you mean?" The sharpened, anxious tone did not escape him. "M. Moreton was always ambitious,"' he said, dryly. "I cannot think what you mean," she said, impatiently. "What is the good of any Southern man's ambition now?" She turned coldly from him, angered by his slowness of speech and provoking manner. "Madame has not heard from the South. She has not heard that there has been a great change of politics: that there- will be elections held in the fall: that M. Moreton will be nominated for office on the Radical ticket." "I do not believe it," she returned, promptly. "How dare you attach dishonor to the name of-of- " "Madame does not believe me: ask him. i He is here: he shall answer. Perhaps madame will make him see the dis- honor he failed to see for himself," returned M. Bujac, with a sneer. "I will see him," she said, defiantly. "And if you have lied, I advise you to avoid an encounter with M. Moreton, which only an accident prevented resulting seriously once before." "Does madame doubt my courage?" said M. Bujac, trem- bling with passion, his sallow face turning a shade more swarthy. "If madame does, she shall test it. I will seek M. Moreton, and renew our acquaintance where the accident interriupted. Ah! I see madame acquits me," he added, with   IN A CRUCIBLE.  -       25 a laugh, seeing her turn pale. "And if I have not lied, I shall take the privilege of entering the lists against M. Moreton. We shall see how foreign'honor will match against Southern valor. M. Moreton is brave, ambitious, good-look- ing -M. Bujac is none of them; but we shall see: les dames sont plein des caprices. Nous verrons " He gave her no time to marvel at this sudden declaration, but tore a leaf from his pocket-book, jotted down Reginald's address, thrust it into her hand, and exclaimed vehemently, "See him, hear him, and judge between us!"- then, without an idea of his presumption, turned and sauntered down the street, whistling a barcarole from, an Italian opera, and left her to digest his news as best she might. She stood there, alone in the street, thinking, not of M. Bujac, but of Regi- nald Moreton. Spite of her vaunt, she believed that the Frenchman had told her the truth. No jealousy would prompt a tale the truth or falsehood of which she could so easily have ascertained. With the keen pang at the threatenings of disgrace to him, she recognized the existence of a  passion for him which she struggled in vain to deny. She loved him! And bending down her head in her two hands, she gave herself up to the delicious tide of that sweet, tremulous first dawning of a passion that makes woman lovely- and lovable. She loved him; and her love had not come unsought. It was no dreaming, girlish romance; but the deep, strong passion of maturer years, that kindled the light in her eyes, making them lustrous with a new, strange beauty; and, for the moment, she had neither the will nor the strength to crush it. In the delirium of a passion sweet and strong, with the flavor of death in its passionate vehemence, she walked quietly home, to dream, as only wo- man can dream, of impossible things: to plan and hope, as only woman can, bidding defiance to fate; and overleaping possibilities, until religion and conscience rise up and lay the finger of relentless iconoclasm on human hopes!   CHAPTER XXXTV. CHECK-MATE. "Ah, me! how sweet is love itself possessed, When but love's shadows are so rich in joy. And what love can do, that dares love attempt." Shakspeare. BRIEF was that delirium of Parolet Trevor! True to her higher and better self, she gave but a few hours to its indul- gence: then turned, with a woman's resource, to prayer, as a refuge. Long, silent, but fervid, that prayer sprang from heart to lip, that she might be kept true to her high, earnest womanhood. , Her early lessons of enforced self-command must come to her aid, and the dissimulation natural to her sex -a refuge ever open for concealment -would enable her to hide the truth from him. Yet how bring herself to meet him - to encounter his clasp on her hands - his ardent gaze -when in those blue orbs smouldered passions kindred to her own? It was easy to form resolves while seated in her own chamber: would it be possible to retain them in his pres- ence?  Yet she must meet him; she must stand between him and his ambitions-must force him to relinquish his pur- pose. He would be vexed at her seeking him--properly so; but he had left her no alternative for effecting her purpose. Even if she forfeited his good opinion; if she never saw him again--and there the woman overcame her.   What a dreary blank life would be without the hope of sometimes meeting him, of sometimes hearing the voice whose slightest inflec- tion stirred her heart and thrilled her pulse, as only one voice can stir and thrill a woman's heart and pulse. 326    . so    vt   IN A CRUCIBLE.         327 It was not a very wide street into which she turned, leav- ing Broadway, and following the badly written address to Reginald's lodgings. Groups of men stood about at office doors, staring at her as she passed, some idly, others insolent- ly. Neither veil nor mantle could quite conceal the hand- some face and regal form that always made her conspicuous. Her heart beat quickly, and she felt a stong sense of relief when she stood under the doorway. Quickly and noiselessly ascending the stairs, she stood in momentary hesitation, her hand on the door, through whose plate glass she beheld the object of her search. She was not near enough to attract his attention, but quite near enough to have a distinct view of all objects within the room. Reginald sat at a baize-covered table, strewn with news- papers, political pamphlets, and legal documents. The latter were pushed aside, and he was rapidly making pencil notes' in one of the pamphlets that lay within reach. The bent brow, the slight flush on the usually pale cheek, the sense of elation visible in the countenance and attitude did not escape her quick eye. No further assurance was needed that what she had heard was true. She turned sick on the instant; then, with a quick hand, pushed the door open, and stood confronting him, with a fine scorn on her expressive lip, and 'her eyes darkening with flashes of something very like-- temper! It was not a moment when Reginald would have welcomed an interruption of any nature; but the intrusion certainly came in its most acceptable form. He entirely mistook the evidences in the face before him; and the elation that had been such an aggravation to her, deepened as he rose and clasped her hand in both his own. With that touch his as- cendency over her asserted itself. Her anger seemed to melt on the instant, and speech became an impossibility. She sank trembling into the chair he placed for her, and turned away   328 ,        IN A CRUCIBLE. her eyes. His own were fairly radiating with the strong, living passion of the man! She could not bear it: she had not come here for this; she must summon courage to speak. "Is it true?" she said, striving to steady her voice. "Is what I have heard on the street true, Mr. Moreton? Is it true that you have forgotten your honor and your loyalty?" It had been a daring speech, addressed to him by ore of -his own sex; and the light scintillated in his cold eyes for an instant, while he released his hold on her hands. Then she rose, confronting him with a face from which all signs of temper had died out; it was filled only with eager; wo. manly solicitude: "Say it is not true. Say you have not forgotten the things for which you have risked life. Say you have not forgotten all the cost of that four years' struggle in which you won a. deathless name." "A deathless name!" he repeated, coldly, laying a sarcastic emphasis on the words. "You forget, Mrs. Trevor, that I was, from first to last, only a private in ranks." "A private in ranks!" she said, glowingly; "that was noblest of all--better than anything you can gain here. Will you forfeit the respect of your own people for the con- tempt of our enemies? Will you make your name a byword  and a jest -on the street?" Slowly the swarthy Moreton blood mounted into Reginald's face; yet he spoke calmly: "You cannot judge of these things as men do. Your feeling is one natural to your sex; but what you urge belongs to a past which must be buried out of sight and mind. There is no dishonor in standing forth for an office in which it is possible I may effect some good."                 . "Stop!" she said, imperatively; "you are deceiving your- self in this matter, or you are attempting to deceive me. It is your inordinate ambition-false and unworthy now-   IN A CRUCIBLE.        329 making the thought of obscurity and nonentity unbearable. If we cannot originate nobility, that which is most commend- able is to copy it in others. Where is General Lee now? Office-seeking under the Federal Government? Are you greater than he?" He winced under the lash of her impetuous tongue. "You taunted me once with not expanding into a man. Is it like a man to take no part in events which are fated to render our age memorable?" "Or despicable," she broke in. "Can nothing move you?" He hesitated; then his brow cleared rapidly,' and a humor- ous smile relaxed his lip.' "We have scriptural authority for honoring the 'powers that be:' Naaman bowed himself in the house of Rimmon." "And Naaman was a leper, whom all men shunned," she said, quickly. "But he had been cleansed when we are told of his policy. He had obtained nothing of Rimmon that we know of, yet there is nothing to show that his course was not justified. There are constant changes in the political world that neces- sitate change in a man's sentiments." "But not in his principles. I cannot argue with you. I am only a woman; but on- all nice points of manly honor, a woman's sense is keener than his own. Do you owe nothing to our friendship? Will you grant me nothing?" It was, an unfortunate speech: in an instant he was bend- ing over her, holding her two hands in his, and forcing her to meet his eyes ,all'tremulous with a light from which she shrank involuntarily. "You have long known that you owed nothing to my promised friendship. Shall I agree. to show this thing up? Truth to tell, it was not much to .my taste; but you know what a strong passion ambition is -how it leads one on to recreant deeds. Have your will; and do not despise me for   330         IN A CRUCIBLE. an act which your enthusiasm has exaggerated. No woman ever thought better of a man for yielding his will to hers. This is not to your will; nor to the case you have made of it. You are a poor lawyer, though not a bad special pleader," he added, with a smile. He still held her hands, his face strangely softened as he gazed into hers, still thrilling with excitement and a keen sense of happiness. There was a dangerous silence, while his eyes were gathering meanings, and the firm clasp on her hands continued; then he drew her suddenly to him, saying, softly: "Yet, Parolet, if you owe nothing to my friendship, you shall owe anything, everything to a deeper feeling than friend- ship." He was holding her to him in that strong, firm clasp that made her feel her powerlessness -that mnade her resolves hard to sustain. She could feel the tumultuous heaving of his bosom as her head lay pressed against it. Slowly their eyes met: his lips were mute, but the flush that always warmed his face into a dangerous eloquence had stolen into the countenance, and meeting her glance, he bent that face lower over hers, and the tremulous lips breathed softly above her own. Then she roused from her stupor, extricated her- self from his embrace, and covering her burning face with her hands, burst into an uncontrolled passion of tears. He stood over her silently, awaiting what he conceived to be only the usual vent for a woman's emotions; but was startled from his customary composure when she raised her head and cried: "Never say that again, Mr. Moreton. We can never be anything but friends. Do not be angry with me; do not forget, either, that your friendship is all that is left me." He was angry, unmistakably, as he turned his face coldly upon her. He had not looked for feminine caprices or  .       *    IN A CRUCIBLE;         331 affectations in her; yet, how couple such an avowal with the evidences he had read in her face while she rested in his embrace. "Forgive me," he said, coldly, "if I have exaggerated the interest you have evinced in me. A woman rarely risks so much/for a friend." No sarcasm could have wounded her so deeply as this speech; but it was not undeserved. She had not now to feel that "Woman is too slight a,thing To trample the world, And not feel its sting; " nor did his coldness pass for indifference. She was not pained at what some would have construed into too ready an acquiescence. She knew that he was deeply pained and hu- miliated; but he was not one to make a parade of his feelings. He would not "wear his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at." What true man ever did? Nor was he one to sue servilely for even that which he most prized. She knew the friendship she was so eager to retain offered nothing to the strong, covetous nature of the man; and was, with a woman's unselfishness, more full of his disappointment than of herself. "I am very sorry," she faltered. Reginald flushed. He was not one to- relish pity from any one. "I care more for you than for any living being; but I cannot marry you. I have been very unhappy; but now I shall not think of that. You have given me the only happiness I can ever know. I shall go South in a few days: shall we never again meet? You will not let me think I have offended you? You will think kindly of me, and say good-by." He would not meet the brilliant, dark eyes she turned upon him, or touch the hand she extended; yet the thought of her desolation touched him, and he said: "I shall not think of you but kindly, and with respect   332         IN A CRUCIBLE. for your sincerity and courage. You erred in coming to me; but I thank you; and will keep my promise, though made; only to a friend." "Ah!" she said, with a little eager flush, and tremble of the lip, "you misapprehend the word, and all it conveys." "Perhaps so," he said, absently. Then he stood watching her as she went down the street, shrinking from the gaze of curious eyes, and hastening her gait. It was not exactly the position in which he would have wished to see his wife; and thinking thus, his brow darkened with a scarcely perceptible frown. Turning the corner abruptly, she encountered the fiery eyes of Monsieur Philomel Bujac, who had been on the watch foar the last hour, and whose temper had not been improved by the long interview with his rival. Instantly she swept away her veil, and, with a woman's intuitive powers of dissimula- tion, summoned to her countenance an expression of sup. pressed triumph, not calculated to soothe the passions of her irascible admirer. "Madame is elate; my news was not true?" he said, fiercely, pacing by her side. "Madame is satisfied," she said, with a little flash of feminine malice. Monsieur Philomel gnawed his lip nervously. If she would only speak, and give him an opportunity for venting his spleen: but she had no intention of doing anything of the kind. She enjoyed his discomfiture immensely; and he had no resource but silence. When they neared the street in which she lodged, she turned, and stopped: "M. Bujac; I bid you a good day. Never be the bearer of unwelcome intelligence, if you wish to ingratiate yourself. It is a thankless office, particularly if your communication prove untrue." She waited, coolly, leaving him nothing but to obey her gesture and leave her.   IN A CRUCIBLE.            333- This he did, saying: "We shall meet again.      Madame fences well, but she is not careful that her weapons bear a foil. Two can play at that game: 'ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute.' Nous verrons!" Half-vexed, half-amused at the audacity of her singular wooer, Parolet turned, and pursued her way, thinking how strangely in life the tragic and the comic are mingled; how easily we turn from tears to laughter-from fr  uneral to mask. Mirth lifts the frown from the brow of Care, and laughter rings over thy silent portals, Euthanasia! "Take hands and part with laughter; Touch lips and part with tears; Once more and no more after, Whatever comes with years. We twain shall not remeasure The ways that left us twain; Nor crush the lees of pleasure From sanguine grapes of pain."   CHAPTER XXXV. A MSSING  LINK  IS FOUND. "Existence may be borne. and the deep root Of life and sufferance make its firm abode In bare and desolated bosoms: mute The camel labors with the heaviest load, And the wolf dies in silence: not bestowed In vain should such example be; if they, Things of ignoble or of savage mood, Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay May temper it to bear - it is but for a day. All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed By the sufferer; . . . . . . . . . Some weave their web again; some, bow'd and bent, * Wax gray and ghastly, withering ere their time, And perish with the reed on which they leant; Some seek devotion, toil, war, good, or crime, According as their souls were formed to sink or climb." Childe Harold. PAROLET was strangely happy when she laid her head on her pillow that night: happy, though she had parted with Hope forever!     Was it nothing   that he loved her?-that she loved him    --though it must end here!       Ah! she would never "crush the lees of pleasure from sanguine grapes of pain;" and who does not who ever forfeits self-respect to passion?   With man, Love and Hope go hand in hand; but woman can love upon a mere memory: and it is a love where purity steps in to hallow! "Yes, love indeed is light from heaven, A spark-of that immortal fire- With angels shared, by Allah given To lift from earth our low desire. Devotion wafts the mind above, But heaven itself descends in love, A feeling of the godhead caught' To wean from self each sordid thought."   IN A CRUCIBLE.          3385 From such dreams, that wreathed even her sleeping lips into a smile, making the face soft and gentle, she was roused, suddenly, to find Susan standing at her bedside, in her white night-dress and bare feet, her face pale with affright, and the tears coursing rapidly down her cheeks: "My baby," she said, in a terrified whisper; "please come to him; there is something ailing him." Quickly she sprang up, and followed her to the child's couch. She had seen enough of sickness to realize his peril when she saw the little limbs rigid, the quick shiver that convulsed them, the blue eyes wide open, the pupils distended and vacant; and kneeling beside him, she forced a few drops of ether slowly between his clenched teeth. For hours she held him on her lap, watching the alternations in his little face, administering such remedies as her frequent experience of sick-rooms suggested, and watching with breathless interest the return of the spasms. Susan sat at her feet, watching her countenance and the child's by turns; weeping quietly, as she saw the little chest heaving more and more faintly, until, as the gray dawn broke, the waxen limbs stretched themselves into marble stillness, the lids fell slowly away from the blue eyes, the lips fluttered faintly, and death fell softly upon an infant life, "like an untimely frost."  Gently Par- olet laid the little form on the mother's bosom, and stole to the open window; where the morning now waked to life, and rosy flushes broke from the waiting East. How often she had been pained at his likeness to her hus- band, and now she traced that likeness more vividly in the white face, the curly head that lay on Susan's bosom! Poor child of sin! The hand of Death came kindly, before that fair, frank brow had learned to blush for a mother's shame  The tears that rained on the clustering curls were the baptism of a sorrowful penitence that would be easily allayed, ere the daisies sprang on his little grave. Looking at the girl, with   336         IN A CRUCIBLE. her childish form, her face bathed in fast-gathering drops, Parolet rejoiced that this one chance more was given her of shielding her fair fame - of returning to her home without the ban under which how few have courage to struggle back to the light! A few days later, and they stood on the deck of a river packet, bound rfrom Cairo to New Orleans. Susan had seemed strongly affected by the death of her child, the leaving his body among strangers, and, more than all, by the con- versation between herself and Parolet, in which the latter had impressed upon her all the consequences to herself should her story become public; and the painful necessity for con- cealment, to which it had led. It was a repugnant task to her to impress lessons of worldly prudence and duplicity, which must come soon enough to harden the young, and render them callous to all generous emotions; but, in this case, her good sense saw that it had become a necessity. To her surprise, Susan, though she made no comment, and only shed a few silent tears, seemed to have awakened to a more lively sense of her situation. Her grief and contrition appeared to have deepened her into something like womanliness; and gave hope that, the blight lifted thus early from her life, the future might not prove an utter blank. Ah! how often are sorrow and crime the teachers, unfolding to youthful eyes that knowledge which, bitter as when the covetous lips of our first mother sought it, brings with its wide stores utter de- basement! Their journey was now nearly accomplished; and Parolet sat alone on the deck, watching the waters that foamed in their wake, and tracing the line of light that silvered each foamy crest. On one side, the cliffs broke the shore unevenly; on the other, the low line of the Mississippi levee marked the swampy tract of Lower Louisiana. Ere another night their destination would be reached; and her apprehensions of river /   IN A CRUCIBLE.         337 travel began to be allayed. The frequent accidents seemed an excuse for timidity; and as her eye followed the winding sheet of that dark body of waters, lashing out wrathfully under the paddles, and leaping high in the moonlight, she shivered involuntarily. She would be unmistakably glad when they were safe in port! A river journey, alone, and unprotected, was anything but pleasant;--nor were her thoughts 'very enviable as she sat there listening to the hoarse scream of the whistle as it rang back from the solitary shore, and watching the lights from the different vessels as they steamed by them. Susan lay, sleeping quietly, and Parolet had more than once turned with intent to seek her own pillow. Several times during her voyage, she had turned with a disagreeable im- pression of the vicinity of some personage, but had, on each occasion, failed to discover them. To-night, as she sat there, she had been more than once strongly affected by that mag- netism which discovers a human presence; but her eyes, turned that way, had been met only by grotesque, projecting shadows of inanimate objects, or the figure of a deck-hand springing up the companion-way. Disturbed by her fancies, she was suddenly arrested by the appearance in their rear of a Western steamer, rapidly nearing them. Luminous from stem to stern, she dashed round a bend, and Parolet heard the rush of the waters under her huge paddles, and caught the startled peal that echoed loud and long, as she ranged gallantly by, cleaving the waves with her prow, and sending the eddies ripling away from her stern. Simultaneously the deck-hands from both packets sent up a cheer, and Parolet felt the boat spring, as it strained forward in all the excitement of a race. Gallantly they sped, the rival packet a few yards in advance, the respective crews sending up cheer after cheer, and the passengers crowding forward, reck- less of danger, and welcoming any excitement that broke 15   338         IN A CRUCIBLE. upon the monotony of travel. The enthusiasm was infectious, and Parolet, too, forgot her terrors in the excitement of that mad race. Suddenly, she became conscious of the vicinity of a human being; and, this time, it was no myth. Leaning against one of the columns that supported the deck, she be. held a man enveloped in the folds of a familiar roquelaure, and encountered the eyes of Monsieur Philomel Bujac. In. stantly a shiver of ill omen passed over her frame. "Madame is excited," he said, quietly; "but there is cause for alarm. , This race is ill-advised on the part of our officers. This boat is not seaworthy." !"You are vaunting your bravery, if, knowing that, you ventured on board. It is to be regretted that your informa- tion comes when I cannot avail myself of it as a warning. I am not foolhardy enough to have ventured on any craft con-  sidered unseaworthy." "I was not informed of madame's plans in time to warn. I risked much to be near her--that I might, possibly, protect her." Parolet remained silent. Was she to believe this? If so, had she treated him kindly? Poor little man! Was she to despise him for daring -to love her! She turned quickly: "If you came South to befriend me on my journey, why is it that I have not seen you until now, -within a few hours of the journey's end?" "Madame was displeased with me. I was satisfied only to 'watch over her. She is in danger, or I should not be with her now," he said, submissively. Parolet's eyes filled. "Monsieur Bujac, you are a very noble man. I have wronged you. Will you forgive me?" His ugly, swarthy face grew wonderfully grotesque with the grimaces by which he strove to conceal his feelings, as he bent over the hand she extended, and laid it reverently to his lips.   IN A CRUCIBLE.         339 After a pause, he said: "Madame Trefor, you are brave; that I know., We are in danger. This craft is unsafe; the river is swollen, and full of timber. If we spring a leak, or the boat fires, there will be a scramble for the boats. Awake your companion: do not' frighten her; but precaution cannot hurt." Parolet turned to him gratefully: "M. Bujac, should the danger you fear come--should I not see you again, will you forget that I insulted you once, for refusing to challenge a man to combat; and remember that I think you a brave one, for risking your own life to protect two defenceless women." "Tut, tut," said the little man, walking off, and grimacing violently; "but for this damnable race, you were safe enough. You women are so enthusiastic: peste!" Parolet left him, and stood at Susan's bedside. The girl lay breathing softly, her small face shaded by the mass of glittering hair that fell athwart her fair, rounded bosom. One arm was tossed above her head, the other lay buried in the folds of her night-dress. With a sudden impulse, Parolet bent over her, and looked intently on the sleeping face- fair, oval, childish. With shadowed brows and curving lips she lay, a picture of childish innocence and purity. Sud- denly she startled up, opening her eyes widely, and staring, in the bewilderment of stupor, at the face bent over her own. "Did you call me?" she said. "I was dreaming of Phillis, and, and -my baby; " and she burst into tears. Parolet hesitated': if there was danger, why rouse her to consciousness? The creaking timbers, the tumultuous labor of the pant- ing engine, and the convulsive effort of the clumsy paddles roused her fears. At all hazards she must make it possible to rescue the girl, in case of the worst!   340         IN A CRUCIBLE. "Rouse yourself, Susan, and come on deck," she said, quietly. "Are we near home?" she asked, yawning, and drying her eyes. "Yes," said Parolet, laconically. Put on your wrapper, instantly."' "My wrapper!"she said, suspiciously, rousing on the instant, her face growing a deathly white. "What is the matter?" "Nothing, as yet; but we are racing, and, in case of acci- dent, I want you with me." Her voice, not raised above its usual calm, quieted Susan's apprehensions. Quickly and noiselessly she obeyed, and the two stood, in a few moments, again on deck. The apprehensions of their companion were not ground- less. - After a few moments, there was a violent shock, then a succession of lesser ones- a frightened pause--a rush of many feet, and a cry of "The boats, the boats!" Susan clung crying and trembling to Parolet, who, pale, but quite silent, watched her companion's face. The engine was still in motion, and the vessel was being steered shore- ward. She had been bearing down nearly amidstream, and the huge, floating timbers of a partly dismembered raft had forced a hole, through which the water was pouring rapidlyr into her hold, and the danger was imminent. Her paddles had been jammed by portions of the raft, but the headlong speed at which she had been running would be sufficient -to run her on a sandbar within such distance of the shore as might be safely reached in the small boats. This the rapid mind of the Frenchman embraced, and his quick eye soon saw that such was the effort being made. He remained perfectly quies- cent until it was effected. Dark figures ran swiftly across the deck, and, amid conflicting orders and deathly suspense, there was a creaking of ropes, a dull plash, and the boats were lowered and brought alongside.   IN-A CRUCIBLE.        341 "Come," he said, promptly; "we must go below." Without a word they turned, and entered the cabin, mak- ing their way through groups of white figures, that, aroused from sleep, clung screaming and crying to the captain, who strove vainly to' extricate himself from the embraces of frightened women, and to impress upon them the necessity for instantly seeking safety in the small boats. They reached the lower deck with difficulty, where, amid suppressed cries from the women and children, and ominous silence from the men, by the glare from burning braziers, white figures were one by one lowered from the vessel's side. "Room for one more!" was shouted; and M. Philomel turned to his companion: "Too late!" he muttered, the drops gathering on his swarthy brow. "Choose between you." How quickly illuminated thought flashed over that brood- ing pause! Should she save her! Her rival--her hus- band's mistress-the mother of his child! M. Bujac, watching her intently, sickened as that bold resolve swept into the woman's lofty countenance. Pushing the nearly insensible form of Susan toward him, she turned her eyes away. On the instant there was a warning cry, and she looked, only to see the girlish form struck from his grasp and disappear under the hull of the vessel. The block and tackle had broken, and, swinging slowly round, had struck the girl from his grasp. But in that one look she had seen what had first appalled, then sent a prayer welling gratefully to her lips. On the girl's rounded neck, as she drooped on the French- man's breast, full in the light of the burning brazier, she had seen suspended an onyx seal, motto, and crest, the counter- part of her own Like a flash, the revelation came That ancestral signet of her father's house lay on the bosom of- her sister! And it was a sister's life she had striven to save,   342         IN A CRUCIBLE. at the cost of her own! The human figures-the glare of lights--the seething waters--the tiny, rocking craft, with its freighted burden - reeled before her failing vision! The figure of M. Philomel sprang up, stood poised, one foot on either side of the life-boat, while he thundered out: "Descendez, vitef Deseendez, a l'instant!" and failing to obey, she felt herself pushed forward, while his rough hand, outstretched, seized and dragged her to him. On the instant she felt herself jammed between the hull of the vessel and the side of the life-boat; and with that sharp sensation of pain, consciousness failed her. A half-hour later, M. Philo- mel, after landing his second boat-load, threw himself into the water, and struck lustily out for the shore. When half- way there, he paused, breathed hard, and looked back. With a rushing in of mighty waters, the huge mass had settled down, and the river was swarming with dark objects, distinctly visible in the moonlight.   CHAPTER XXXVI. A DEATH-BED REVELATION. "One whose faculties, Sharply strung, sharply smitten, had failed to express Just the one note the grea final harmony needs. And what best proves there's life in a heart? - that it bleeds I Grant a cause to remove, grant an end to attain, Grant both to be just, and what mercy in pain! Cease the sin with the sorrow I See morning begin! Pain must burn itself out, if not fuelled by sin. There is hope in yon hill-tops, and love in yon light - Let hate and despondency die with the night!" Owen Meredith. "WILL Arthur Moreton never come?" It was Phillis Warner's voice, issuing from     the pallet where she had lain for many weeks, dying. "I am here," he said, stepping under the doorway as she spoke, and answering that sharp query.   "I am here, where I should have been sooner, but for imperative calls elsewhere." "And where is Susan?   Will she never come.   Have you written, as you promised?" "Yes; but the letter may not have reached her." ".Ungrateful hussy!" muttered the woman, turning her head restlessly from side to side. "Ungrateful hussy!" she kept muttering. Arthur looked at the gaunt figure, the wasted, hollow cheeks, the cavernous eyes and hollow temples, and wondered how long this was to last.. Day after day he had been sum- moned there, only to hear her complaints, her restless desires that Susan might be brought to her, her fierce resolves to live in spite of the doctors, and mysterious hints which con- firmed his previous doubts as to Susan's parentage. Again 343   344         IN A CRUCIBLE.  and again, as the days went by, and Susan failed to appear, he had urged her to delay no longer any revelation which might affect the girl's welfare. To-night, as he looked at her, impressed by the swift change that had passed over her face since he last saw it, he was about to speak, when, as if in reply to his thought, she said: "This is nigh about the end. I can't last long: she might ha' come; she need n't stay away any longer." For a few moments longer, she rambled on in unconnected speech; then suddenly collected her voice, raised her head, and spoke: "Come here, Arthur Moreton," she said; "come here, and listen. Susan a'n't coming: something tells me Susan a'n't comin'. She's played me false, or the letter has. Anyhow, I'll tell you all about it; and maybe the Lord 'll have more mercy on Phillis Warner 'n men had, when she seeks him to- night." Arthur came, and sat down by her bed.- Hers, he feared, had not been such a life as would bid her look death fear- lessly in the face; yet she seemed nothing daunted. "You knew Cecil Chandos?" she said. "He used to live in St. Bevins; but he came down here sometimes. He was a wicked man--a hard, daring devil; but you would n't know it by lookin' at, or hearin' him talk. He had a rare face, and a smooth tongue; and if he set his head on a thing, he'd be sure to win it. I said his head, for he'd no heart. I was a young woman then, and a pretty one; and whenever he came down here, and put up at the tavern, I waited on him -for my step-mother kept it. She let me do such things, but her child was sent to school, and learnt to read and write. She was younger than me. I don't think she was as hand- some; but she had soft, nice, ladylike ways - talked like one; and her shy airs made men think better of her. I was n't a bad girl then, though my ways might have been freer than   IN A CRUCIBLE.        345 they ought; butafter Chandos took to comin' after me, I tried to mend 'em. I loved him, and thought he did me. I believed he might be made to marry me if I did right, and so I kept him off. He used to come down every week or two to the village, and my sharp tongue (for I had a sharp tongue, if I was n't educated) used to amuse him. He made out to be very fond of me, and he had coaxin' ways; but I stuck it out. I had always a sharp word for other folks, and I'd no notion of givin' 'em a chance at me--'specially the women. He might love me, but I knew what love meant from such as him to me; and I wanted, too, to be made a lady of, for I knew how 't would hurt my step-mother and sister. I told him I was an honest girl, and he said he believed me. I don't know how he got sight of my step-sister, for she never came about the tavern; but one night, when he 'd been drinkin', he chucked me under the chin, and said: ' You're a sharp one, Phillis--tryin' to walk into matrimony on the honest dodge; but it won't do. The men tell hard tales on you, and the women worse. You must come to the scratch now, for I've seen a girl more to my taste; but I'll give you a chance.' "He did n't believe what he said, Arthur Moreton, but he meant me to think he did. I could n't stand his telling me he didn't believe in my virtue, for he had tried it enough to believe in it. I had, loved him, and stuck to him, though there was no good said of him. I kept my temper now, and told him I was an honest girl, as he well knew, and that I would n't be anything but his wife. If you had seen the look he gave me, and heard him laugh. I did n't know till then, quite what a .devil he was. 'My wife, Philly!' he said; 'what could put that into your silly head? Get it out, as quick as you can. Gentlemen don't marry servant-girls in our day. If that soft little sister of yours had said it, I'd say she'd been reading King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid; but you-why, you can't even write your name, you baggage; 15*   3846        IN A CRUCIBLE. and not a waiter in the house but has held you on his knee, I'll warrant.' "One of the men lounged forward. "' Come, Jem,' he said,' what do you think of the quean as a lady?' "The man had no reason to like me; I had spurned him with sharp words, and he did n't intend to let the chance slip: I saw it in his eye. "' Phillis is a sharp girl,' he said, with a knowing look; 'a very sharp girl.' "It was n't what he said, the villain.! 'T was his tone and manner. "' It's a lie! I burst out. ' It's a lie; and he knows it.' "Chandos burst into a laugh: 'A lady would n't have said that, Phil: mend your manners, my girl; ' and he went down the stairs with his gentlemanly swagger. I knew half the house had heard what he said to me, but I think I cared less for that, then,jthan I did for him to make such a speech. He knew nothing ever cut me like being told I could n't act or speak like a lady; though it was n't likely one brought up as I had been should. Do you- wonder I hated him? Do you wonder I hated that dainty step-sister, when I saw her casting down her sly eyes at his speeches. No need to tell you how it ended. She fell, and all the village knew it; but things were looked at very different to what they would have been in me. She was a nice, modest-lookin' thing, and the man was to blame for it: but with me, the thing would n't have been looked at in that light. I was a bold-mannered girl, with a sharp tongue and an eye to my own interest; and that's what the village would have cried out with one voice, if I 'd been the culprit. Poor and rich, the world's all alike -'t a'n't the sin, but the name you call it by, and the manner you Fcan salve it over with; and the Lord seems to let men have it all their own way, with Satan to help 'em. There   IN A CRUCIBLE.         347 a'n't much good that I can see, though I'm not book-learned enough maybe to make out what it all- means; but I don't see as those that are, are much help. - He did n't tire of her as soon as I thought, for men always hang on longest to silly soft-spoken things that women can't help despisin'. Perhaps it's pity; they think they can't take care of themselves--and they can't; but they manage to make better women do it for 'em. "Before her child was born, Bessie came to me. My step- mother had died, and I had bought this cottage, and went out washin' and doin' day-jobs, makin', as 't was my boast, an honest livin'. There was n't a man or woman in the village, either, that dared gainsay it to my face. Bessie died when the child was born, and not a soul but pitied her, and said I'd never let her have any peace after her sin. - Now I'd never said a word to her, but I would n't have been a woman if I'd ever let a chance slip of braggin' of my own honesty; and lettin' her know that I would n't do for love what she'd done for the sake of leadin' an' easy life and dressin' like a lady. That child was Susan. The only time I ever spoke to Chandos, or he to me, after he had deserted me, was when I brought the child to him, over Bessie's dead body. He knew how I felt about it all, for there was n't much for bad shrewd- ness that he did n't know; and when he caught my eye, holdin' the child out to him, he scowled at me, and then he smiled and undid a trinket from his watch-chain. ' Here, Phil, here's an onyx seal, that belonged in its day to great people. It's never been shamed till now; but you put it on that young one's neck, and I'll own her some day. It shall be a pledge. You'll be glad to see Bessie's child made a lady of-as you could n't be; but you see she 's got a streak of genteel blood.' I wish you could have seen him while he was sayin' all that. When he got through, I had my say: "'You may own her,' I said; 'but she'll never be anything but- '"baggage"-after all; and I'm an honest woman, and -   W   348         IN A CRUCIBLE. that much better than her,' I said, pointing to the body, 'As to this toy, I 'll put it on that child; but it a'n't the first time it's been shamed. That happened the day you first wore it.' "He swore at me, and stormed out of the house; but I kept the vaunt of my good name, and flung it at him while he lived. I never forgave him: I hated his dead body; and after he was gone, I took to drink and bad ways, and I vented my spite on his child. What else did it deserve at my hands? It did me good when she came to grief. She was just like ;Bessie, with her sly ways, and her dainty face, and soft voice, and book-learnin': just the sort men like, too, and I knew what was before her. Was I sorry? No; I was n't. I was glad. I had reason to hate her, and I did.: She wasn't fit for anything but what she came to. Men know that when a woman's got any brains of her own, she knows her worth, and that she's got a soul that's as well worth takin' care of as their own, and they a'n't half so likely to harm 'em: I never looked at Susan without thinkin' of this; and I tell you, it did me good. If I did n't put her in harm's way, I never put out a finger to save her. There 'd been nothin' to save me, but my own hard sense; and I was n't bound to furnish her with what she had n't got. You see, I just followed my instincts, like any other ignorant thing would, and they was n't good ones: was I to blame for that?" She had struggled up into a sitting posture, and her face, turned toward him, was filled with the evil passions her story had awakened. There was everything to shock sensibility in the coarse recital of her wrongs; but there was much in, those wrongs to palliate her errors in the minister's eyes. He had been startled at the revelation she had made; he was pained at dwelling upon the connection she had established between Susan and Parolet Chandos; yet when her recital was ended, he became intent only upon soothing the passions of the dying woman. Gradually, as his quiet words of pity and prayer   IN A CRUCIBLE.         349 fell upon her ear, she relaxed her brow, and lay back on her pillow. "I'm not so hard on the girl, now," she muttered; "I a'n't sorry she's out of harm's way. She used to seem fond of me, sometimes; and I 'm sure I've missed her. I a'n't a good woman, Mr. Moreton, but I've told you the truth about the girl; and if it'll do her any good, I 'll not care. I've told the truth about myself too. If I took to bad ways at last, it came of the drink. When Chandos first died, I was n't sorry. I thought I hated him; but after a little, I missed him, and grieved after him, and thought how little I had to make life worth carin' for. I took to drink to keep from frettin', and that led to worse. Fine ladies have plenty of ways of killin' time and drivin' away care; but there's nothin' to reward poor folks for doin' right, or to turn 'em from bad ways when they 're driven to it. If you rich people would only think of this, and seem to care about it, we would n't hate you as we do. It a'n't envy of your money and your learnin' and your manners: it's just hate that you can care so little for the poor and their miseries -that you can be so hard on them, and so easy on one another. It's that turns the poor man's blood to gall. I'm   a' dyin' woman, and I'm tellin' you nothin' but the truth. It's what you'd hear from many a poor mouth, if you ever stepped out of your way to learn it. You can go now. I don't care for preachers to do my prayin'. I'll die some time to-night, and I guess there's somethin' in my life He can take hold on." Yet Arthur did pray, kneeling by that bed of death--long and fervently, that He would soften the hard heart of the ignorant, misguided woman. When he rose, she made no re- cognition of his presence; and, with a few whispered words to her attendant, he went away. Before the morning, Phillis Warner was dead; and news had come to St. Philip's of the disaster on the river. !   850     ,    IN A CRUCIBLE. Arthur learned, too, through a few hurried lines from Con. stance, that Susan was lost, and that Parolet Trevor had been brought to St. Bevins a helpless cripple. The full bearing of these evil tidings had not reached him; but the news served to send him to St. Bevins the instant his attendance on Phillis Warner's burial was over. There he arrived in the dusk of evening, to learn that Parolet still lay uncon H scious, from fever that had set in, consequent on excitement and exposure, that Constance was nursing her, and that Regi. nald was still in New York. All this he heard from Edith, in a breathless, unconnected way. "Think of Rege being absent at such a time! He is always such a help when there is need of coolness.' They were brought to St. Bevins, as the nearest point from the disaster; and Constance, hearing of Mrs. Trevor's condition, went up, and brought her here. The doctors think her re- covery extremely unlikely; and that absurd little French. man that brought her here, hangs about in the most distract- ing manner; jabbering about heroism, and what not, but giving one no satisfaction about what we are dying to hear." It was a great relief to Arthur when her chatter ceased and Constance came swiftly into the room, her face pale from fatigue, her soft voice tremulous with emotion. With her hand in his, she told him, in her collected, womanly way, all she knew of the accident. Her brown  eyes drooped before that pained, stricken look on her brother's stolid countenance. She had long suspected -she now knew his secret. "She is here," she whispered; " she has never spoken col- lectedly since she was brought here, nor moved, more than the quiver of an eyelid. The doctors think this will pass off-they are not apprehensive about that; but"-here she lowered her voice, and laid one of her slender hands on Arthur's knee-"but they fear there has been some injury to the spine, and that she will never walk again."' l   IN A CRUCIBLE.         351 She looked away on the instant, with true womanly feel- ing; not desiring to intrude upon a weakness which a man strives always to conceal; but she felt the knee on which her hand lay shiver with the involuntary convulsion her words had caused. His mind had not grasped such a possibility: a cripple all the days of her life! And he had believed that life held no greater ill than an aching heart and a burdened spirit! "She must wake to consciousness, only to learn this!" added Constance. "Ah, Arthur! think of her endeavoring to save that serving-girl, at the expense of her own life; and having it given back to her, only for this!" I She shuddered and turned pale. Arthur thought of Phillis Warner's death-bed revelation; of Cecil Chandos's crime; of the wronged woman, whose ill-spent life lay at his door. The stern spirit of Hebrew prophecy wrung its reluctant avowal from'his heart. A life for a life! Was not the fulfilment met? Had not the father's sins recoiled upon the children, living and dead? Parolet's was a life noble in its purposes; grand even in its failure, he felt sure it would be. Why ques- tion its results on earth? He could not answer her: his lips could not frame speech; and when the darkness grew around them, Constance stole back to her charge, and left him alone. I  v            f   CHAPTER XXXVII. THEN FAREWELL HOPE; AND WITH HOPE, FAREWELL FEAR!    ...   ...... .. . "There are hours Which belong to unknown, supernatural powers, Whose sudden and solemn suggestions are all That to this race of worms--stinging creatures that Crawl, Lie and fear, ancddie daily, beneath their own stings - Can excuse the blind boast of inherited wings; When the soul on the impulse of anguish hath pass'd Beyond anguish, and risen into rapture at last - When she traverses nature and space, till she stands In the Chamber of Fate; where, through tremulous hands, Hum the threads from an old-fashion'd distaff uncurl'd,- And those three blind old women sit spinning the world." Owen Mereditf.  A FEW   days subsequent to Arthur's arrival at St. Bevins, Constance, as she   entered the sick-room, and  drew  back the curtain of   the bed, saw Parolet's eyes open  consciously on her own.    The lips parted impetuously; but the  voice that issued thence was low   and tremulous: "How   long have I been ill?  What am  I doing here?" "You have been ill more than a week.    I had you brought here:  you  were in no  condition then to be taken  to New Orleans." "I remember," she said, with a slight shudder; after which she lay silent for some   moments.. Slowly her eye   fell upon her surroundings. The handsome room, the costly furniture, and rich   hangings could belong  to no place in St. Bevins save one! Her cheek flushed uneasily. "Constance-Miss     Moreton, I  must go  home, at once. You have brought me to Moreton Place: that was very kind, but I  cannot remain here."  352f:   IN A CRUCIBLE.         353 "Will you see the doctor when he arrives?" said Con- stance, evasively. "The doctor! Have I been so ill as that? I do not feel very ill; I think I will be quite strong in a day or two; though, if you wish it, I will see him, certainly." Constance went quickly from the room. Descending the stairs, she heard Reginald's voice as he crossed the hall, con- versing in low tones with Arthur. A few moments later, when she entered the library, they both stood at the window, talking earnestly with the medical men who had been in constant attendance on Mrs. Trevor since her arrival. She went quickly forward, with a clasp of the hand, saying: "I am glad you have come, Rege; no one else ever takes your place in the house, and this is all so trying. She is con- scious," she added, turning to the medical men; "but does not seem to have a suspicion of the truth; and I had not the -courage to tell her. Will you go up?" Even their presence failed to- enlighten her. Her face was a little flushed, and the eyes unusually brilliant. She smiled, saying: "Miss Moreton is spoiling me with so much solicitude. Will you assure her that there is no need for detaining me here after a day or two? I am very urgent to reach New Orleans." Constance turned away her face, and scarcely heard the reply of the physician as he bent over her. There was another consultation in the library; after which she was summoned. Their family physician came forward to meet her: "Miss Moreton," he said, gravely; "my worst fears for Mrs. Trevor have been confirmed by the opinion of these gentlemen. There has been serious injury to the spine, from which she can never recover. I fear her lungs are also affected by the ex- posure; though upon that point I will not speak positively. It will not be necessary to alarm Mrs. Trevor. The office ,                     , /   354         IN A CRUCIBLE. would be a very painful one to you; and she will make the discovery for herself. While I sympathize with you in the painful task you have undertaken, I do not doubt her forti. tude will enable her to bear any burden with which Provi- dence has seen fit to afflict her. I have known Mrs. Trevor from her girlhood, and I never knew a woman who united greater generosity of soul to more undaunted heroism. Her story needs no comments; but only generous souls are capa- ble of such unselfish self-sacrifice as that to which she owes her misfortunes. Further attendance, at present, is unneces- sary; but should she desire it, you may summon me." He bowed and withdrew, followed by his brother physicians, and Constance went slowly back to the sick-room. At the foot of the stairs she turned back, and sought Reginald. "Rege," she said, "you must keep Edith out of Mrs. Trevor's room. You are the only one who can do it; and think what an inadvertent word might do with that poor sufferer." She had no thought of him; nor did his extreme pallor- attract attention- in one so habitually pale and cold. Another week passed away: a week of sickening dread to Constance--of great trial to her patient. The latter had gained strength; and with returning strength came restless impatience at her protracted confinement. "You do not realize, Miss Moreton, what inaction is to me. I have always been so active, so strong, so full of vitality! Indeed, you mistake in thinking'it could harm me. You have been very kind," and she raised Constance's hand to her lips; "but I feel like Gulliver when the Liliputians had bound him. The withes of your will are really very slight, but I dare not break them, knowing it an obligation. I owe to hospitality. Will you not release your prisoner?" she pleaded. Constance turned away her face. She could not meet the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         355 dark eyes that were looking so wistfully into her own; and, overcome by grief and anxiety, she trembled violently. Parolet's suspicions were at last aroused. What was it that could so move quiet Constance Moreton. Constance felt. the clasp on her hands relinquished, and there was painful silence between them. When she ventured again to turn her face, her heart died within her. There, on the pillow, lay a face from which every hue of life had faded; and the large brown eyes were fixed upon her own, the pupil dilating and con- tracting rapidly, covering the iris, anid giving that distended look, that pitiable dread of some unforeseen calamity. Her lips were trembling violently, and the damp dew of anxiety gathered on her brow. "What is it you are hiding from me?" she said, search- ingly, with a slow, labored articulation. "What is it you are hiding, from me?" Constance could only turn her gentle, pale face away, for the tears were rolling swiftly over her cheeks. "Is it death " she whispered, softly. Constance ,hook her head. "Then what is it?" she queried, her tone altering to that sharpened intonation that was like a sword-thrust to her com- panion. Receiving no reply, her head settled itself back on the pillow. She had not swooned, and there was no sign of emotion, save the nervous quiver of the lips and eyelids: the eyes themselves were dark, passive, and serene; and Con- stance, watching her, saw that she was striving, in that dumb pause, to meet a possibility that was slowly suggesting itself to her. "If it is not death--" she said. "Stop! I have heard of a greater horror: could it be that? I have not felt anything below my waist since - " She had been speaking in a doubt- ing, hesitating way, her large, serious eyes turned like some stricken thing upon her companion's face. She stopped   356         IN A CRUCIBLE. abruptly. She must have seen there the confirmation of her fears, for she turned her face quickly to the wall, a strong shiver passing over her frame, and, for an instant, convulsing her features. Constance lingered, looking at her as she lay there, with. out a wail of despair--a moan of defiance- accepting the fate that, far exceeding the bitterness of death, had been meted out to her: accepting it as only the brave and strong can -silently I The helpless form, the grand face that lay so passively with closed eyes, with high, calm brows, throning a man's intelli- gence -a man's firm resolve -awoke in Constance a mutinous spirit. She felt a strong sense of remorse when she thought how often she had censured this woman for little social errors that had been her condemnation in the eyes of her sex; and now, how poor and frigid and paltry she seemed; shrinking with her own littleness, daring no word of intrusion to one who had risen so infinitely above her! No little maxims, no frigid decorums had pared down the generous impulses of nature in this woman -had stepped between herself and that act of daring heroism. No meaningless words now struggled for utterance on lips that had grown mute, but not defiant, when Hope fluttered forth forever! r The woman's clear mind had compassed the great evil that had befallen her-; but her woman's heart did not shrink, or grow cowardly. Softly Constance stole from that presence, oppressed with its sacred solemnity. A light fire burned on the open hearth in the hall, but the library was dark and empty, and thither she made her way, burying her head in the cushions of the sofa, where she lay, long hours, waiting to be summoned back to her post. Life had never seemed so solemn, even to her thinking mind, as it did now, impressed as she was with the earnestness of that which was passing in review before her; attended by all the charities, now that Death was toning the   IN A CRUCIBLE.         357    .  picture. Alas for humanity! that it is so often only in sum- ming up the final account that the balance is rendered, and that the mantle of charity falls, often, only as a pall for the bier! None entered to interrupt her vigil, or her musings. It was a quiet household. The sleeping apartments lay sepa- rated from this part of the house by the main building, which was rarely entered save at meal-times. Arthur, when at home, had his private study under his sleeping-room in the tower, and this gloomy library in the east wing was the occa- sional resort of Reginald and herself. Its sombreness was most in keeping with her feelings as she lay there awaiting her summons to the sick-room. It was late in the afternoon before that faint tinkle from Parolet's bell smote her anxious ear. The fire had burned down in the hall, and a chilly evening breeze blew across from the open door. It was a lovely day, such as only a Southern sky can yield, and, saddened by its beauty, Con- ! stance lingered a moment at the open door. Edith, in a bright walking-dress, played at croquet on the lawn with a party of young people, and a sigh struggled to the sister's lips as she heard that silvery voice, so like Reginald's, pealing out in its merriest tones. She was not thinking then of the suf- ferer up stairs; but the shadow deepened under her brown lashes when she remembered another voice that had made manly music in its low love-whispers, and that a green mound on strange soil was to Edith no longer even a memory. She was not looking at the gay group over whose bright faces and picturesque costumes the western sunlight was streaming rich and warm. Reginald came slowly through the avenue, his soldierly form erect, and the reins held lightly between his gloved fingers. His head was bent on his breast, and the pale face shaded with care. Suddenly, as he came upon the group under the trees, he checked his horse, and his stern face clouded over. For a moment he hesitated; then, seeing  ^358        IN A CRUCIBLE. Constance, checked the desire to utter the rebuke that lingered on his lip; and relaxing his bent brows, he came to her side.  "You are not like Edith, Constance," he said, impetuously. "How could I ever have made so great a mistake in my sisters! There is nothing of the woman in Edith; but I did not expect such levity as this." "She is not unfeeling, Rege; only young and careless. She was shut out of the room, and there is no likelihood of anything of this penetrating the sick-room: even the sun. light cannot enter there - the light she loved so dearly. D(o not expect of Edith what belongs to my maturer years ad  graver character."  "And to your more womanly heart," said her brother, pressing his lips to her cheek. "Thank you," she murmured softly. "I am sorry I cannot stay with you, but I was on my way to Mrs. Trevor when the loveliness without lured me to linger. Do not chide Edith." Whatever had been that communion, there was no evidence  on the pale, patient face that was turned toward her as she entered the room, and the clear, ringing voice was low, soft, and tremulous as she said: , "You were wrong not to have told me sooner, dear Miss Moreton. We can always bear the inevitable, and delay is only cowardly, When one prepares for eternity, time is valuable." I: "But you have years of life before you, dear Mrs. Trevor; years in which to keep us busy executing whatever you wish. We will nurse you back to an interest in life. Whatever you wish done, there will be plenty who will do: not from pity, but because few are in ignorance that you owe your misfor- tune to your unselfish regard for another. Ah! Parolet," she burst forth, " do not despise us that only adversity has shown ' us all there was to admire and love in you." It was a tardy acknowledgment; but it was grateful, com- ing as it did from one unused to exhibit emotion, and wrung   IN A CRUCIBLE.         359 from her by a sense of how far beneath her the scoffers had been. Parolet's eyes filled: "I, too, have censured," she said; "and what a reproof has your care and kindness been! Ah, Miss Moreton! it is only in sick-rooms, or when the heart withers under a sense of great sorrow, that one learns to prize woman -to know ,what her sympathy and care is. Will you forgive me that I have blamed her for the fault of society. Cramped, narrow, and intolerant as her surroundings are, she is true to herself when the barriers are cast down. Let us forget what has been: the past should be no theme for idle regrets, and can never be of use, except as it teaches us to govern the future. You have said there were years of life before me; but you are mistaken. To a nature more apathetic, this might be a possibility--not to me. When I ceased to hope, I ceased to live; and it will be only a question of gradual decline. I am not deceiving myself in this matter. I do not wish such a life as mine would be. I have had such a pride in my strength, my youth, my vitality, through which God has re- buked me; and I submit. Will you take my school in charge? I mean the office that I had reserved to myself. I would like to feel that it will prosper-that I have effected some good. You can take that care from my mind; will you do it?" She paused, until the required promise was given; then she said:  "I would like to see Arthur- Mr. Moreton. Is he here?" "Yes; he came as soon as he heard of the disaster. Regi- nald, also, has returned." There was another pause- then she spoke: "Miss Moreton, if your brother- Arthur, I mean- will come to me, I would like to see him. I must have some one intrusted with my business." "Rege is a better business-man than poor Arthur; will you not see him in preference? He would willingly serve you, and can do so much more efficiently than Arthur."   360         IN A CRUCIBLE. "Thank you," said Parolet, in great agitation; "but I would rather see the Rev. Mr. Moreton." "Certainly, if you prefer it. He has only waited until you desired it." But she was thinking, as she crossed the room, what a trial it would be to Arthur. At the door she'turned: "Would you mind seeing that little Frenchman, when he comes .again? He has been here constantly, and his distress is really pitiable." Parolet's face had flushed at the first mention of M. Bujac; now the eyes filled, and the lips softened. "Poor little man! Does he care so much for me? Yes, I will see him when he comes. Where is he now? What is he doing here?" ",He is in the village, and declares he will not leave until you see him. He is an odd, curious creature, and they say really saved the boat's crew, taking the small boats twice to shore, and swimming after them to avoid the floating wreck, when he found there was no room in the last. He was the only passenger who swam with the deck-hands. Who but a Frenchman would be so polite?' "He is more than that: he is a brave, generous man, with a nobility of soul that on such occasions makes one lose sight of his ugliness and his antics. His cool courage that night saved the lives of many terrified women, who would have precipitated themselves into the water. We should honor that little foreigner, Miss Moreton; he fought from first to last in the Southern army." "So Rege says. I believe they met once during the war, and had some difficulty, in-which Rege thought-the French- man did not appear very well; but when he heard of all that had passed on the night of the wreck, he sought out M. Bujac, and made the amende; which the little man accepted with so much good feeling, that he wound up by asking him to come here, where he could have better accommodations than at the village." *   IN A CRUCIBLE.         361 "And he would not come?" asked Parolet, with interest. "No; you should have heard Rege tell the story. He drew up, his rotund person, stroked his ragged mustache, and said, 'No, Monsieur Moreton. I have accepted your amende: brave men mutually respect one another; but, there are reasons why we cannot be friends.' Rege said his manner was really laughable, only he was too serious and too much in earnest for one to venture upon such a thing. It was as if one of Napoleon's soldiers had said to him, 'Vous Wte 'empereur; mais, moi, je suis Philomel Bujac.'  M. Bujac paid him more deference than he had ever shown him before; but at the same time seemed to say,' Do not condescend to forget that I am not strictly your equal.' " "I wonder who and what he is?" said Parolet, musingly. "Up to the war, simply a poor, honest man, I imagine, and as proud as honest poor men are likely to be. I do not know that he explained to Rege what the reasons were that prevented their being friends. If it is pride, it is of a nature that one always respects. I am glad you will see him, for I cannot help liking the man with all his familiarity: indeed, we all like him; and Rege, who has never been known to go into the village except on business, or on election days, has, since M. Bujac's refusal to come here, gone down to his den, and smoked away whole evenings with him. Think what a character he must be, when he can attract even Rege." Parolet knew there was another motive that had aroused this interest in the foreigner, and it thrilled her heart to think she had power to move to gratitude the unimpressive nature of the only man she had ever loved. She knew, too, what the reasons were that had risen up like a barrier between the two men, in the heart of the punctilious little foreigner, and she was moved to kind feeling toward her preserver. Yet she said nothing, and Constance left her to summon Arthur. 16   CHAPTER XXXV II  BREAKING THE LINKS, "' Know this, surely, at last. Honest love, honest sorrow, Honest work for the day, but no hope for the morrow, Are these worth nothing more than the hand they make weary, The heart they have sadden'd, the life they leave dreary? Hush I the sevenfold heavens to the voice of the Spirit Echo: He that o'ercometh shall all things inherit." Owen Meredith. THE door had reopened, and admitted--not Arthur, but M. Phlomel Bujac. He came quickly forward, his rugged 'face full of emotion, and his fiery eyes softening with happi. ness. He did not speak when she laid that fair, slender hand in his brown palm; but he held it there, looking down upon it silently, then upon her face; not as a man looks upon that of the woman he loves, but as a Catholic devotee upon that of his patron saint. Then M. -Philomel sank suddenly on his knee, and hid his ugly face on the little hand. Parolet was too tmuch touched at his emotion to think of the absurdity of its manifestation. "Why, mon ami, have you nothing to say to me?.' she said, with a faint quiver of the lip, and a little huskiness of the voice. "What a world of anxiety I have caused you! and I can make but poor acknowledgment, lying here helpless; but I have not forgotten that you are my preserver- that I owe you my life." The little man sprang to his feet, and began pacing the floor, restlessly: "I saved her life, and she thanks me   Pauvre femme! she thanks me that I have brought her to this!" 362   IN A CRUCIBLE.         363 She could not hear his words distinctly; but she caught something of their purport: "Yes, M. Bujac, I thank you. I thank you that I was not given over to death, until I had proven life not utterly worthless because deprived of everything save the power to do good, and the privilege of learning to estimate one's self and other things justly: before I learned, too, that love is not always selfish." She held out her hand again, and M. Bujac twinkled away a tear from his bright gray eyes. "Chre amie! dans toute la force de Page!" he murmured ; "cela me perce le coeur. J'en suis inconsolable." "Is it nothing that I have summoned you here; that from my bed of death I have addressed you by the only title I can truthfully bestow - that I call you my friend?" "It is much, chore amie. It is more than Philomtl Bujac deserves; but it is the privilege of friendship to grieve. Shall you not permit me that poor consolation?" "Ah! M. Bujac, I am not chiding you; but it is you who are consoling me, by such proofs of affection; for the heart clings to human ties so long as we have only humanity to boast. But you shall have proof of my friendship-of the esteem and trust in which I hold you. I have in operation a school for the education of Southern children-you shall be one of the'trustees. It will be an office from which I would exact attention and care; and the salary which I will attach to it you will regard as a proof of my gratitude and friend- ship. I would not give that position to one whom I did not consider both competent and conscientious. Me donnerez- vous cettepreuwed'amitiM?" she said, softly, turning her large eyes coaxingly upon him. He did not guess that she had secretly determined that the salary of which she had spoken should prove an independence to the proud, poverty-stricken foreigner who had fought for the South.   364         IN A CRUCIBLE. She cut short his protestations: "You will remain here, then; and *when I am gone, you will assume the obligation I have asked of you, remembering that you earned my grati- tude by so doing." "I will remain in St. Bevins, since it is madame's desire," he said, simply, blinking away the moisture that was dim- ming his fine eyes and gathering fast and heavily on his lashes. Homely and untidy, with even emotion betriying itself uncouthly, Parolet had little thought of anything but his love and his loyalty, as she watched him from where she lay. "You suffer?" he questioned, tenderly, caressing the ivory hand that lay on the coverlet. She shook her head, and a sad smile played over her lip: "No, mon ami; I do not suffer, thank God! - unless that fearful absence of pain be counted as suffering; and truly,'at times it seems appalling, knowing the cause." "You will let me come sometimes?" he said, huskily. "I am afraid not, my friend. I had rather have nothing to remind me of links that, to the last, bind the frail heart- to earth, when it should seek anchorage above. With my own hand I will sever those links, which I, who sometime re- gretted, now rejoice are so few. One by one I must put them from me, while courage is left me to part calmly; for who may safely weaken their nerve when the last great trial asks all.:' A cloud darkened his brow at these words: "Madame puts me from her, first. She values other friend- ships more than mine. It is well!" he said, folding his arms on his breast, sullenly. "The order of your coming mattered little," she said; " when one must suffer, what signifies whether it be first or last? For every tie that my hand is resolute enough to sever, my heart must ache: your pain is the lesser one. Our interview   IN A CRUCIBLE.         365 must not last too long. The Rev. Mr. Moreton has promised to see me; and I have business to arrange with him that will cost me an effort, and induce fatigue." The cloud shifted on M. Bujac's brow. "It is the priest you would gee?" he said, uneasily. She gave him one of her grave, searching looks, before which his own fell shamed. "The priest," she repeated; softly. "The priest, and early friend of my girlhood: him but for whose unshrinking truth and courage I might not be now facing death with so un- stained a conscience." "Pardon, ma chere amie - pardon!" murmured the re- buked man; "je suis susceptible, et jaloux, vif et impftueux: pardon!" "I am not angered," she said, gently, drawing her hand from his grasp; "but such feelings as you express are not fitted for such a time. Have done, my friend; you wrong yourself. I hear you have seen and spoken with Reginald Moreton. This is as it should be:' fighting in a common cause, why should you not be friends?" "Friends!" said the Frenchman, coldly; "we can never be friends! M. Moreton sought me out, to - apologize!" "Why should you not be friends?" she persisted. "M. Mordton came between me and my desires: he sup- planted me. I had but one passion for my life--he had many: yet he succeeded where I failed!" "Succeeded!" she said, sadly. "What folly! Am I a fit subject for contention? You must meet as friends, over my grave: shall it be so?" "There is no friendship without equality. M. Mor6ton is rich and aristocrate: I am neither," he said, coldly. "Neither signify with him. It was very noble in him to seek you out and apologize: why underrate yourself, when he ceases to do so?"   366         IN A CRUCIBLE. "Ceases to do so!" he said, with sarcastic emphasis; for. getting all but his jealous rage. "Ceases to remember that I am not his equal! Doit-il etre insolent parce qu'il est riche " "You are unreasonable. He sought you out to apologize; nay, he did more. He recognized your merit; and made the first step toward equality when he tendered the civilities of friendship." "Of gratitude," he said, with emphasis. "Madame mees- takes. It is true M. Moreton did tender me all the civilities; I may say 'heaped Pelion sur Ossa:' for what? I had saved madame's life! and my rival offers me a room beneath his roof, and the privilege of witnessing his grief for his dis- appointment, or--of triumphing in mine. I prefer to be alone!" "Yet you do see him. He is with you often." "Madame is conversant with M. Moreton's movements. When he seeks me, I receive him, as one gentleman should another," he said, wrathfully. She regarded him in grave displeasure for a moment; then she said:   "I fear I must withdraw the privilege I had bestowed upon you, M. Bujac: you are passionate, unjust, and cynical. Can I hold you trustworthy when this is the case? The mat- ter which I had confided to you was very near my heart, and-" She did not finish the sentence: subdued in an instant by her tone of sorrowful reproach, he threw himself again on his knees by the bed, covering her hand with kisses, and begging forgiveness: "Je tdherais de me rendre digne de l'amitie, dont vous n'honorez," he asseverated, vehemently. "I hope so," she said, quietly. "And now, listen. I told you I was to see the priest: so I am; and he is all to me that I asserted: but before I die, I shall also see his brother."   IN A CRUCIBLE.         367 His swarthy face flushed; but he controlled himself, and remained silent. t You have said he was rich and aristocrate. The former would be but a poor foundation upon which to build pride: he is incapable of the baseness of triumphing in your pain. As to being aristocrate, we have no distinction of classes in our republican country." "No distinction of rank, perhaps," he said, deferentially; "but is there a working-man, a rough laborer, who would presume to thrust himself beyond that barrier which is the panoply of a Southern gentleman? that .'Je ne sais quoi,' which is another name for polite assumption." A faint smile flitted -over her face. The Frenchman was giving form to a fact- palpable, but not subject to very dis- tinct analysis. *' Polite assumption! The assumption only of gentlemanly culture and refinement. It is too instinctive to be assump- tion: it is also too distinctive to be mistaken. Wherever you meet a Southerner you will recognize him by that polished urbanity which you mistake for proud condescension; but, M. Bujac, we are not too proud to seat at our board the daily laborer. Only Northern houses, in America, are the Al Bordj where the poor man never enters on any footing save that of a dependant. Is this not true? We have an aristocracy; but it is that of intellect and culture: no poor creation built upon the crumbling foundation of wealth. And in the South, alone, you may behold what you, perhaps, never will else- where throughout the world - a free commingling of several ,grades of society in friendly fellowship, yet where those in- visible lines of demarcation are never lost sight of. It is a distinction which isfelt, if rarely expressed." He had heard her in silence, and did not dissent. She watched his countenance a moment, then she said: "You must say good-by, now; and you will not pain me   S68         IN A CRUCIBLTE. by cherishing such thoughts. When it is all over, you will be here to follow me to my grave, as one of my best and most highly valued friends." She held out her two hands. M. Bujac took them, and pressing them roughly between his own, said, in a broken  voice: "To remain here, and not see you, is not possible; yet I would not pain you. I will make a pilgrimage. You will permit me to go; and when I return, it will be to prove my affection and fidelity, by fulfilling your trust by the grave of her I love." Parolet was deeply moved: less by his words than by the touching humility of his submission to her will. "You are right, mon ami," she said; "it would be asking much that you remained here. Go; and return only when you can bury your enmities and regrets in my grave." "I go," he said, dashing the drops from his eyes; "I go, that I may see for once the hero of the South: it is all that is now left me; the only wish my poor heart has room for!" "General Lee!" she exclaimed. "Ah, mon ami! you have made me envy you. If I might have seen him before I died!" "Yes," said the Frenchman, enthusiastically; " since it is denied me to be with you, I go to see General Lee. Ce grand homme sera toujours la gloire de son pays." "And that country is the South!" murmured Parolet, sinking back on her pillow, and waving M. Bujac away.    CHAPTER XXXIX. ALPHA. "Judge her love by her life. Pure was hers: And the dear God above, who knows what His creatures have need of for life, Through much patient strife, led her soul into peace. She saw dawn clear and clearer, as life's troubled dream Wore away; and love sighed into rest, like a stream That breaks its heart over wild rocks toward the shore Of the great sea which hushes it up evermore With its little wild wailing. No stream from its source Flows seaward, how lonely soever its course, But what some land is gladdened. No star ever rose And set, without influence somewhere. Who knows What earth needs from earth's lowest creature? No life Can be pure iB its purpose, and strong in its strife, And all life not be purer and stronger thereby." Lucille. WITH the manful reassumption of his duties, Arthur More- ton's characteristic resolution had -returned to him. He had suffered, on learning Parolet's fate, as only men strong in their passions, and clinging in their affections, can suffer; yet he had brought himself to submission; and looking upon her, now, as upon one lost to human ties, he stood at her bedside, filled with the mission of his priesthood only. There had been moments given to the weakness of his man- hood; yet that season had gone by. Even the voice that had always thrilled him, waking all the poetry of his being, and stirring his nature with its music, roused him only to a sense of her helplessness- of her 'wrecked womanhood- and to the knowledge that he was there as the priest, counsellor, and friend. The pitiable condition to which she was reduced seemed a stern rebuke to the folly of cherishing longer the mad passions of his youth; and the calm, resolute face he 16*        369   370         IN A CRUCIBLE.  turned upon her, betokened the victory he had won: the victory of self-conquest, than which none is nobler-none more difficult of achievement! He was deeply moved, as he could not fail to be, and she first broke the silence: "The problem of life has been solved for me, dear friend There was little need for me to have laid so much upon my poor brain. It has failed me oft; but this is the end!" "Not the end," said Arthur, hoarsely; "only the begin- ning!" "God grant it!" she said, solemnly. "Nor do I doubt it dear Arthur. He has sorely tried me; but I doubt neither his love nor his mercy." "His mercy is infinite; and he is the God of love," re- peated the priest, softly. She lay quiet for a few moments; then she said, earnestly: "Yet, Arthur, my life has been so full of longings -of pas- sionate regrets and hopes! How do I know now that they are quelled? Who may say that, rising from this bed of death, the same strife would not enter with returning life? I have never believed in death-bed repentances; dare I measure my. self by another standard? There seems no proof where there is no test." "Has yours been only the regeneration of spirit to the dying? Dear woman, your gift of grace did not begin here: 'by their fruits ye shall know them."' "Yet religion had nothing to do with all that; duty and conscientiousness were the motive powers." "The spirit of good is the spirit of God. Do you re- member the words of a celebrated divine on that subject? 'Moral goodness and moral beauties are realities, lying at the basis and beneath all forms of religious expressions. Change your lives, aim at heart excellencies; that is the first thing to say, and to feel. Then, the doctrine of the spirit comes; not as a cut-and-dried dogma, but the interpretation in deeds of   an eternal necessity of the soul.' Your resignation to the will of God in an hour like this, is not to be mistaken. When death lays his hand upon us, the sophisms of the brain vanish- the fallacies of life are laid bare." "You have given me great comfort," she said, musingly. "Yet you are only judging as man- not as God, who knows all my heart. Ah, Arthur! how often our secret thoughts shame us: how often the acts which seem noblest to others, shrink into nothingness when we admit the motive! What will you say, when I tell you the prominent thought in my mind, when I turned from that one chance of salvation? It was not fear of the death that was awaiting me, or dread of the sublime Unknown. It was the wild thrill of delight that, though it had come, it was to be nobler than my life had been. That poor, cramped, insignificant life seemed so paltry beside the grandeur of laying it down for another. It was the 'grand soul,' won at last, after years of repining for the littleness of things! The sweetness was snatched from my very lips. I was given back to life, shamed that such thoughts had marred its best act. What thoughts were these to have crowded upon the hour of death, Arthur Moreton? Has your priestly lore no solution to the restless thoughts of the dying?" He met her eyes bent eagerly upon his face. How like was that confession to the tenor of her whole life! In that resolute face he beheld the determination to learn the truth of God's revelation to his creatures: to know it through distress - through humiliation, perhaps -still, to know it. With her clear intelligence she was gathering from the life below, the tangled threads that had formed the woof for that grander fabric hereafter. How should he answer her? How say whether that leprous taint which humanity breathes into the fairest creations of man, is held of moment with God! In his heart, he believed that the deed is of far greater mo-   72       -  IN A CRUCIBLE. ment than the thought--that the victory is valuable in pro. portion to the severity of the contest; yet his was only human wisdom, which could do little to enlighten the mind of the dying. "God pardons much to the frailties of his creatures: to the power he has granted to evil. From him alone you must seek both wisdom and forgiveness. Your life has been one long contest, and the end is worthiest of all. Never doubt his exceeding love, or that the wisdom and the strength earnestly sought will be vouchsafed. I dare not speak with assurance; for all that belongs to religion is forfaith to lay hold on. We can prove nothing here - one's religion must come through their own heart's desire, and through prayer. Arrogant assumption of a wisdom which shall answer the re- quirements of every man's mind,'ill befits the ministration which we are told is only preparatory-therefore imperfect." "Let it be," she said, gently. "Why should we forget that the priest is only the man, after all? You are very humble, Arthur Moreton.  Many might condemn  you that you refuse assurance to one dying; but Christ himself would not always pass judgment. We are told 'he wrote, with his finger, in the sand,' to avoid their questionings. If he dis- trusted himself, why not you? If you cannot judge me, you can pray for me.  If I seek light, He will give it, even at the eleventh hour. He will not let me die with a lie in my heart, or on my lip. You will execute my'wishes in regard to the disposal of my means. The bequest to Susan Warner you may use for the benefit of some charitable institution. There has been some talk of founding a hospital for Southern soldiers, on the plan of the 'Invalides' in Paris. If it is carried into effect, you will 'donate it in my name; if not, you will bestow the same amount on some institution for the support of indi- gent women. Some proof this shall be that a true woman's sympathies are for those distresses among her sex which society does nothing to alleviate. My school will prosper,   373   IN A CRUCIBLE.   with God's blessing. You will attend to all this; and now, I have one more request to make of you." She paused, shadows gathering in her large eyes as she turned them tremulously upon him. "When I am gone, you will reveal to Reginald the secret of my life." She looked long and wistfully into his face as she made this request. At a blow the fair fabric of Arthur's life was shattered. The untrammelled heart of the woman held no niche for the love he had trampled under foot. His boy- hood's hope, his manhood's wreck, had drawn nothing from that blank. He had entered that room with hope and love buried in the grave of resolution: but his heart was only human; and he had cherished the belief that nothing but his vow stood between himself and the love of his life. Now the rock of his last hope was shivered;; and paling to his very lips, he had bowed his' head in acquiescence. "Not while I live," she whispered; "not while I live, dear Arthur. He must not know the shame that has risen up be- tween himself and the woman he has loved so blindly: who has loved him, ah! how madly, how passionately, yet how purely! - as only a woman can love. Grant something to my weakness. Only one brief hour of happiness; and the grave will close on the struggles of one who has 'suffered much.' And now, Arthur, dear friend of my otherwise friendless girlhood, we must meet no more until you are summoned to my bed of death, as the priest of God, only." The priest of God, only! he thought, drearily, as he left his last tie in that sick-room. He had buckled on his armor; nor did his. strong heart fail him, as he surveyed the broad field of the future, whose imperative calls left little chance for the rust of sorrow and disappointment. She had never loved him I The iron of truth struck him sorely; but it nerved him against idle mem. ories and sorrowful regrets, as nothing else could have done.  CHAPTER XL. ADSUM. "Life, relenting, accords the good gift we would have; But, as though by some strange imperfection in fate, The good gift, when it comes, comes a moment too late. The Future's great veil our breath fitfully flaps, And behind it broods ever the mighty Perhaps." Lucille. ONE brief hour of happiness she had asked; and the golden beaker was held only to the lips of the dying. One brief hour of happiness! How many hearts have echoed that prayer; from how many lips the mad whisper has pealed --in  vain!    With  her own hand she was to close the vista, which, shutting out life and all it had held, was to leave her only to eternity -  and   to a memory strong  enough to sweeten all that bitter past.  In that one hour she was to drain existence. There were to be no lees in her cup now. Not for years of life would she have bartered that privileged hour with the man she loved. The pale, worn face was fore- shadowing her prophecy of speedy release. The beauty im- pressed upon it now  was that only of the heart and  the spirit; for  "Sorrow can beautify only the heart-  Not the face - of a woman; and can but impart Its endearment to one that hath suffered." Yet never in all the  flush of health had  Reginald's heart stirred as it did now when the thrill of those deep eyes was upon him:                              I '  . **   "those true eyes, Too pure and too honest in aught to disguise The sweet soul shining through them." Upon his own face, a man's silent sorrow had chiselled 374   IN A CRUCIBLE.         3 75 lines so deep that they seemed wrought with the graver's steel. At the first whisper that stole in low, loving tones from her lips, the massive head was buried in her bosom. "Parolet," he said, passionately, "Parolet, why have you sent for me?" "Why have I sent for you?" she said, softly. "Why have I sent for you? That I might look once more upon your face - that I might hear your voice- that I might tell you - " She brought her lips to his cheek, and nestled her little hand in his tawny beard, stroking it softly, while she whis- pered, so low that he scarcely heard the whisper: "That I might tell you how dearly I have loved you- how truly-!" "Loved me!" he said, bitterly. "You tell me this now; now, when it seems such a mockery of happiness. Ah Paro- let, how cruelly you have trifled with the destinies of both." "Hush!" and the slender hand flattened across his lips. "It could have done no good. -Why should both have suf- fered? Believing me cold, you would have turned to all that- in the life of a man -holds so rich a promise." "You suffer!" he said. "Can you know anything of love, and 'deem it a passion so slight that its void may be easily filled? I was no idle boy to toy with love. I gave you a man's affection: it deserved a better fate." "Nor was mine the silly dream of youth, that lives only in the fulfilment of its selfish desires. You will learn all this some day. You will learn to value the heart that was too unselfish to pain you by its hopeless avowal of affection -too pure to seek a gratification in the dregs of self-respect. Rea- son and conscience alike forbade me to form other ties, when those that had bound me were mercifully broken. You say I do not know what, love is," she added, passionately. "Ah! Reginald, you are the one love of my life; yet I tore it from me that I might not shame you. Do not look so; I am   376         IN A CRUCIBLE. worthy of your love--of your. respect. Ask me nothing now. Not while I live would I have you learn to remember with a shudder that you would once have made me your wife. How I have coveted that title! -which you will never give to another, Reginald? Had I lain once on your bosom, or my lips sought yours, as a wife, I had asked nothing of you; but you will not give to another the right that has been denied to me?" She had folded her arms about his neck, and her large eyes were gazing up into his, pleading, as one might for life. "Ah! you never will!" she said; "you never will. I shall not fear it: not when you know what my life has been -what my love for you--my duty--enabled me to put from  me. You will bear your part among men. You will- not fritter away your life in idle regrets. You will reremm- ber that 'work is worship,' and will set your hand resolutely . to the plough; putting aside false and unworthy ambitions; always holding at heart the true interests of the 'land we love.' Let your country be wife and mistress: to her, only, will I yield my place in your-heart." "Parolet!" he said, his coldness melting away, his reserve breaking down before the grief that was fast unmanning him; "'Parolet! why did you leave me on that luckless errand? This seems so cruel. You deserved a better fate!" "It had to end some way.   Life would have been very bitter without your love. You must learn submission." "I cannot!  I am a man; and my manhood craves some gift of life." "Then let it be something worthier than this," she said, re- bukingly. She was very happy, lying on his breast, talking in low,  loving tones, of all that had made life a burden -of all that made death a release: as happy as only woman can be, know-  ing it is only love's shadow she is hugging to her heart.   IN A CRITCIBLE.        3" "You will learn all from Arthur. He has been, through all, my kind, trusty friend. And Reginald, you will befriend that poor, friendless foreigner, who risked his life for mine. He looks upon you as his successful rival, and I did not un- deceive him; but you will bury all animosities; you may win him-to like you; you will do it. I have bestowed upon him an independence; and allowed him to befriend me: that will suffice for his happiness."' "You have left me nothing to do for you," he said, re- proachfully. "I have left to others my cares," she said, raising his hand to her lips; " to you, only my love." He was too Mnuch moved to do more than press his quiver- ing lips to hers; and in the silence that ensued, she was sum- moning resolution to put him from her. Scarcely a sound disturbed the serenity of the hour. Out- side, the evening light streamed over the lawn, and the heavy shadows crept slowly eastward. Peacefully the day bowed itself to meet the embraces of night, stretching forth her sceptre and dying right royally, though her crown of light was being wrested from her. It could die calmly, knowing the canopied west but its couch of rest; that, though twi- light wept its dethronement, a world waited its advent, now, as of old, when, trembling through chaos, fell the divine, command -"Let there be light!"  On the starred east the divine birthright was bestowed; and from her solemn crypts sprang the sceptre and crown of Young Day! A royal gift was that inheritance, nor was the imperial lustre dimmed on that autumn day, when Parolet lay dying in her shrouded room, while the western sky blazed like a huge chrysoberyl. Suddenly, a redbird lighted on the bough of an apple-tree that swayed across the window, and broke into a gush of melodious song. Clear and mellow poured those notes from the pulsing throat of the songster; and Parolet's   378         IN A CRUCIBLE. face shadowed over as she listened. The pang of sorrowful regret clouded the dark eyes, while she whispered: "The nightingale of the South, Reginald! He is telling me of the brightness out of doors. His song is one of love and worship; and how strangely my heart thrills with those notes! Hopes and passions are laid at rest, nor would I cling to life for them; but one touch of nature like that, stings me into a passionate yearning to live. Ah, Reginald  mere existence is a pleasure to youth, surrounded, as we are, by so much that is beautiful." After a longsilence, she again spoke: "You will leave me, now, dearest. I shall yield my love only with my life; but even you must not come between me and prayer. I too must have light; and I do not fear to meet night, fortI too have a birthright, and shall claim it when the day breaks." For one long moment he held her to him, pressing his lips to the fading cheek, over the shining hair that was gathered over the pillow; her loving eyes taking their last look. Then he laid her down on the pillow, not trusting himself to speak. Before the day broke, she had sought the light she loved under the shadow of a  great throne; and Reginald had heard from Arthur's lips the story of her life. * i -  I    CHAPTER XLT.. "ABOR IPSE VOLUPTAS. "God means every man to be happy, be sure. He sends us no sorrows that have not some cure. Our duty down here is to do, not to know. Live as though life were earnest, and life will be so. Let each moment like Time's last-ambassador come: It will wait to deliver its message; and some Sort of answer it merits. It is not the deed A man does, but the way that he does it should plead For the man's compensation in doing it." Lucille. Via Crueis, via lucis; vincit, qui se incit,"  whispered Con- stance Moreton, under her breath, while the pages of an open letter fluttered in her hand. Her words had reference to Arthur; yet she was not thinking altogether of him, as she stood in the doorway, with the light at her back. It had been many months since she had come to Arthur's rectory; for he had a rectory now, on the outskirts of the little village of K----, in his old parish of St. Philip's.  It offered scarcely greater comfort than the forsaken lodgings, saving the quietude that was rarely broken; and to its modest accommodations the womanly fingers of Constance had lent an air of peace and homeliness that no bachelor dwelling ever presents. It was just beyond the church, whose clanging prayer-bells pealed above it; and on the farther side lay an open common, stretching  away to the woods, covered with nodding clover- blossoms, and hovering bees, and with patches of golden sun- light lying athwart. Here the village school children shouted over their marbles and kites; and village nurses strolled out on sunny  afternoons, with their charges. It was the best that 379   380         IN A CRUCIBLE. could have been, Constance thought, when she had left St. Bevins and cast her humble lot-with the minister's; and they had made the best of it; working hard, and asking little; thankful for what the present held, and too wise to dwell upon the might-have-beens, with which this village toil had nothing to do. There was work for their hands in that railway town, with its idle, dissolute population; its drinking-shops and gam- bling saloons: work from which fastidious taste must revolt; but there was no shrinking in the minister's resolute mind, nor in that of his quieter, gentler, but not less resolute co. worker. There was work which the four years' war had not found where it left; for not to advance, is ever to retrograde. The church-work was to be begun almost anew; there were children to be instructed, and a bitter spirit of discontent, envy, and irreligion to be quelled. Their time, as yet, had been limited-the results not encouraging; but neither were cast down. To be at work was, in itself, a comfort; and the results would ensue.  t Faithfully and untiringly that modest, unambitious life was followed out; with no evidences of selfish regrets for lost happiness; and Constance had waked to affection and admi- ration- rising like a true woman to meet the requirements of the station she had assumed, and to strengthen and counsel him, as she so well knew how. Both held a  stake beyond the graves of their affections; and no life that does not, fulfils any promise of worthiness! Neither had ever regretted the luxurious idleness they had wilfully laid down; and their plans and hopes rarely strayed beyond the life they had assumed. Yet to-day there was a little flutter of expectation on Miss Moreton's quiet face, which seemed strangely disturbed from its wonted serenity, as she stood shading her eyes with her hand, and gazing up the long, dusty street that led from the village. She was   IN A CRUCIBLE.         381 watching for Arthur; and her lips had given forth that soft whisper when she caught sight at last of his expected form: "Vincit, qui se vincit. Yes; he has conquered," she added, below her breath. "And the path of the cross is that of light! He can bear anything, I think; but I could hardly bear thatfor him." She kept silence, watchingfhim as he came slowly forward, knapsack in hand, and full of travel-stain; pausing occa- sionally to exchange greetings with the working-men. He was too distant for her to read anything from his face, had he meant that she should. He would never come, she thought, half vexed, as he bent to caress a little cripple that was being trundled on the sidewalk for an airing. A moment after, Miss Adeliza darted across the street, seized hold of the Rev. Mr. Moreton's hands, and began gesticulating and talking rapidly. Constance could catch nothing of their speech; she could only see by the quiver of Miss Raeburn's bonnet that she was in one of her not uncommon states of excitement. Was she congratulating, or condoling? thought Miss Moreton. She released him at last; and then he caught sight of Miss More- ton's waiting figure, and hastened his step. The strong, patient face was full of its pleasant curves; but that was not always an index to the contents of the volume, or an answer to her questionings. She waited for him to speak. He laid his two broad hands on her shoulders, and glanced at the letter in her hand: "Well, Con, what is it? One of Edith's tintless, odor- less telegrams of fashionable follies?" "It is not from Edith," she said, impatiently; then she broke out: "Oh, Arthur! have you nothing to tell me?" He looked at her, gravely, for a moment; then smilingly, and took his hands from her shoulders, tossing his travelling- sack within the doorway, and saying: "Come, Con; let us take the bit of sunshine left us, out on   382         IN A CRUCIBLE. the common with the nurses and children. We have a half. hour before prayers. I always like out of doors best." She would not ask him again. She walked on by his side, with the sunlight shining on her troubled face and her soft gray dress. Hers had been a cold, hard face, once; resolute, and full of intelligence, but neither sweet nor lovable. It was not sweet now, but her secret sorrow had toned down the fine edge of pride that had made it repellent, and liv- ing for others was fast softening the placidity of expression into something more winning. Delicate and ladylike it had always been, with clear tints, if not bright ones; and the soft neutral colors she wore were in sufficient contrast to the pearly complexion and brown eyes. Her hair, uincovered, and with the light shining on it, showed, amid its wealth of glossy brown, faint threads of silver where it lay low and smooth on her brow; for the Moretons turned gray early. "What of your letter, Con?"Arthur said, at length. "Oh, Arthur!" she said, with a little passionate gesture that startled him, coming from her; " how can I talk to you of my letter, when I am thinking of the other?" He could not pain her by further silence. "The nomination has been made," he said, quietly. She looked at him, eagerly.  "And you did not get it? Oh, Arthur! can you stand there so quietly and tell me such a thing." She ended with a little disappointed cry that went to her brother's heart. "You hoped to get it: I know you did." For a  moment, he walked by her side silently: "I quite approve the selection. I had no right to hope for it; and if I did, remember, I am not the only one disap- pointed. Indeed, I had least right to expect it, after what had occurred during the war." "But up to the war, Arthur; surely that might have been   IN A CRUCIBLE.        883 taken into account; and what occurred after, was from purely conscientious motives. You always worked so hard for the Church; and no one is more capable." "So each one thinks, no doubt. We had better say no- thing more. The thing has been decided for us, and we have nothing to do but to submit." He walked off a little way, talking to the group of chil- dren that were at play, and left her standing there. She felt the soft breeze blowing across the fragrant clover-beds, and listened to the shouts of the children and the humming of the bees' then looked at Arthur, and thought, a little bit- terly, how unlike this was to her dreams for him. Was he really content? she thought, as she saw him smiling and chatting in the midst of the little group; was this really to be all? There seemed no reason, now, to believe otherwise. She swallowed down a little gulp of disappointment, and endeavored not to think-of how much she had built upon Arthur's being a bishop. If Rege had brought himself to contentment, why not Arthur? Why should she be so pained at what seemed to cost him so little? He was not looking at her: he seemed quite intent now, talking to a laborer, who, with bundle and stick, was trudging home across the common. His voice, as it reached her ear, was pleasant and cheerful. "Good night, Hardiman. I 'm sorry to hear of your trou- bles, and we will see what can be done for you. Miss More- ton will send down medicine and proper diet for the sick wife and little ones. No thanks, my man. The war has brought hard times; and we must help one another." Constance's heart smote her. Must he have been indiffer- ent, because he bore disappointment like a true man? She turned a wistful glance upon him as he sought- her- side, but he seemed quite to have forgotten the subject of their former discourse. "That poor man is not able to work," he said; " but he is   384     -   IN A CRUCIBIE. not able to lose his wages either. Something must be done for him. I will see to it; and if you would not mind the walk, we will go to see the sick wife and babes, to-morrow. He was a good soldier, and an educated man, quite the gen- tleman; yet he is willing, nay, glad, to get work as a day. laborer in the village." Something rose in Constance's throat, and choked her utterance; but it was not the lump'of sour disappointment she had swallowed down a few moments ago. "There is so much of this," went on Arthur, quietly, "it makes one quite sad; or would, if we had not reason to be equally proud. The hardest species of mental labor is not to be compared to manual drudgery, when one must descend to it from wealth and idleness. There is the battle, too, to fight with false pride; and it is a terribly hard one some- times. Self-conquest is not easy, Con; though one might be de. ceived sometimes, seeing only results. Do you not think so?;' "Oh, Arthur; you are talking right at me. -Iow could I think that it was nothing to you?" "Do   not make that mistake again," he said, gravely. "As   to talking at you, it is just as well to think a little of others, when we have a  mind to become self-engrossed. When I   see a gentleman, quite as good as myself, save in the accident of,fortune, with a trowel in his hand, it sets me thinking; and my thoughts take a healthy direction." They were quite close to the church now, where a number of Confederate soldiers were waiting in the porch for the doors to be opened. The bell was clanging loudly, and made speech an impossibility. Arthur waited until it ceased. "Shall you go in?" he asked. "Not now," she said, quickly; "not to-night. Come in, as soon as it is over; and after tea, we will have the letter to talk over; and other things," she added, with a tremble in her voice.   IN A CRUCBiLE.         385 "And other things," he said kindly; then added, "We'll have out the delfto-night, Con; shall we? Just as a reminder." He was half in jest, she knew; but it pained her. How often she had heard that story of Arthur's tea-drinking in the lodgings! '( Oh, Arthur! please do not say that. I will not forget, again." "Not until there's another nomination for bishop, I sup- pose. Well, Con, your ambition is purer than most, when it leads you to think of your brother, instead of yourself. I must not stand talking longer. Prayers will soon be over. The congregation is not formidable," he added, with a sigh. Constance looked after him as he entered the church. "Such a limited field!" she said; "and he will not even use his talents in a way to become popular. He is so afraid of pulpit tricks, and of standing upon anything but real merit. Yet how few are: popular or successful who do not court it! He has no associates here, either, but--" Here she paused, thiinking of the fishermen. She did not stand long in the street after that. She went into the little rectory parlor, and lighted the lamp; busying herself with the tea-things until prayers were ended.. When he came in she saw that he looked pleased. "Things are brightening," he said, as he took his teacup from her; "decidedly brightening. The refractory silver- smith was at prayers, and behaved well. After service he walked up the street with me, and spoke to me about chris- tening his young folks: he-also gave me a small sum for the 'Soldiers' Relief Association.'- His whole bearing and con- versation speak a decided improvement. Even two years ago there was not a worse man in the village, nor had I a more implacable enemy." "And is -this to satisfy you  always, dear Arthur?" said Miss Moreton, sadly. 17   186        IN A CRUCIBLE. "I trust so," he gave answer, smiling up into her face, with so unclouded a brow that her eyes suddenly filled. " I trust I shall ever be ' content in that station to which it has pleased God to call me.' And now, if you please,-we will have the letter, and other things." "Arthur," said Constance, "do you remember what your favorite Horace says: 'If the world's wreck should fall about him, the ruins would not crush him.'" "Well?" said Arthur. 'Well," said Constance, with a little burst, burying her head on his shoulder, "I think something equally grand might be said of you." "You should have been called Consuelo," said Arthur, stroking her hair; "you have been my Consuelo since you came here." "Ah, Arthur! never say that after to-day. You have shamed me. I am worth so little; and I thought I had gained so much." "You are worth everything to me, Con," said Mr. Moreton, holding her at arms' length, and looking at her with moist eyes. "And I think you may even claim some intrinsic value. Was it not a great deal that you were willing to leave all the pomps and vanities of Moreton Place, that you might work for 'such a cause, in such a place; resigning all that women of your rank think indispensable to happiness; and forget- ting that you were one of the Moretons of St. Bevins?" Miss Moreton put the minister's hand to her lips. " We    have both done with'happiness, dear Arthur;" add- ing, "How it annoys poor mamma and Edith !   this very for- getfulness that we are of the ' Moretons of St. Bevins.'" Arthur looked grave: "Let us have the mother's letter." She gave it into his hands, and put away the tea-equipage while he read it. When he had refolded it, she came and sat at his feet.  IN A CRUCIBLE.         387 "Mamma seems pleased with Edith's marriage." "She has reason to be; Mr. Calcott is far beyond Edith's deserts." "Poor Edith! she never had much tolerance from you, Arthur; yet she is not lacking either in mind or heart." "Then she has the less excuse for exercising both so seldom. No one is harder upon others than Edith. Does what mother writes of Reginald surprise you?" "One can hardly realize that," she said, slowly; " it seems strangest of all that Rege could settle into anything like the life mamma pictures." "And deplores," added Arthur. "Yet it is very worthy - very noble, one might almost say, knowing the man: taking a manly part in the life around him -holding aloof from all ambitious strife. And then I think the best of all is his hav- ing family prayers at Moreton Place; the example is so much from him." "Yes," said Miss Moreton; "and mamma says, for once Edith had neither ridicule nor sarcasm ready. She thinks, s because she was too much astounded; but I think poor Edith is less frivolous. I think none of us have been quite so thoughtless since the war. That, and Parolet's death, led to mlany changes. Rege seems so different! When he was down last, about Parolet's school, I could scarcely see in him the same man. He was just the one, if he changed at all, to do so thoroughly; and whatever he works for in the family, or parish, you may be sure he will accomplish." "Reginald never had any vices," said Arthur; "and was always much more reverent than any of the family." "Do you remember his college-life, and later, the soldier- life, as we heard it from Captain Trevor? Yet it was no- thing half so good as this. Think of 'aristocratic Rege nurs- ing the sick poor, and almost turning Moreton Place into an almshouse for lame Confederates; and then his taking ,-:   388         IN A CRUCIBLE. charge of Ralph's widow and children! Chester says he has gone mad, and will turn preacher: if so, what a pity there were not more madmen,!" "I do not think he will 'turn preacher,' either. He has no fancy that way; and, indeed, will do much more good as it is. There is no excuse for his goodness now. You need not look rebuke for that speech. You know how little prone we are to believe that a man may change his life, from the simple grace of God. It is always some sorrow, some inci- dent that turns up to propel him Godward. If he becomes a clergyman, policy makes him saintly; but it will be hard to lay hold on anything in Reginald's life to have given its bias. Young, wealthy, End talented, it was only that natural turn- ing to the nobler part, which belongs to all worthy natures when they once have trampled self under foot." "Yet, Arthur, sorrow should impel us Godward; else, why sent?" "So it should, Con; by all means take the lesson then, if it has not reached you before. But as to turning good from any but good motives, I will not hear of it. You know there are people who keep an account with holiness - a sort of merchant's ledger; coveting, one might almost imagine, dis- appointments and sacrifices, that he might hold a balance to his credit. Some need no motive ]Uut their own innate good- ness and purity-others do need a motive: let it be a high and holy one, taking no account of merit." There was a pause; then Constance ventured: "Yet, Arthur, do you think Rege would have changed, but for Parolet's death?" It was some moments before he spoke; and when he did, his voice was not quite steady: "I think, when selfish views were lost sight of, the worthi- ness of his character made itself manifest. Self is the great stumbling-block; and until we lose sight of that, we can ac- complish nothing."   IN  A CRUCIBLE.         389 Constance knew that his words, though applied to Reginald, had an equal reference to himself. How both had shaken free of that canker, when the love of a life was swallowed up . in the grave! She was very proud of them, thinking that this could only have been of men true enough to cull from the past only strength for the future!  Tennyson's lines came to her lips, as she bent over him, candle in hand: "And men may rise, on stepping-stones Of their dead selves, to tigher things." FINIS.
