INTRODUICTORY CHAPTER.- The broad highways of life are, and have ever been, the resort of the many. The lanes and hedge-row paths are trodden but by few. There is no doubt that the projector of a new railroad- renders a much more impor-t tant service to his country than he who is only  occupied in trimming a hawthorn hedge: but all are not constituted alike; and as the hedge must be trimmed, it is well that there are those whose inclination as well as' powers alike. dispose them to linger in the shade. A stranger rambling through a beautiful hamlet, far removed from the noise and- tu- mult of the busy world, was struck with the   6      QUIET THOUGHTS air of ex eding quiet which prevailed around. The leafy woods which rustled with the soft breeze that moved among the branches, and the clear stream that, winding along among the underwood, formed ever and anon a water- fall among the broken ground that constituted its channel, produced the only sounds which fell upon his ear. As he advanced, a solitary woodman appeared coming up the glade, and in one or two cottages a stray female and a little child. "Where are all your people gone?" said he.  " 0O they are all away," said the woodman; "some to the election, and some to the fair, and some to this new railroad business.' I think our folks' heads are turned.." "And why are you not gone too?" said he. "I have no mind to it," said the old man;  I have been collecting fire- wood for my dame."  "And you too," said the stranger, addressing a young woman who was kneading flour at the door of her cottage. "Why, sir," said she, ," we are best at home: you see, some must stay to prepare the even-   FOR QUIE'T HOURS.      7 ing meal, and keep the house in order; and if our people do not come home before, you see they are sure to "come at night." It seems to us, gentle reader, that a parallel might be drawn between the world around us and the inhabitants of this quiet village. The world is in a high state of feverish ex- citement. "Many are hurrying to and fro, and knowledge is increased.". The great events which are crowding one upon another, each one of which is sufficiently important to form a distinct volume in future history, may well call forth the deepest energies of our race, and send out the most capable and stir- ring spirits among us to mingle in the mighty fray, and from the tangled and complicated mass ,to draw forth the thread which shall guide the nations into peace. And while some are thus engaged, others are tracing back the chart of prophecy, and endeavoring to read from its mysterious pages the meaning of the mighty events which are rolling on with such fearful rapidity. With   8      , QOIET THOUGHTS' earnest and inquiring heed do they ponder the amazing theme, and all-absorbing is the interest to their spirits. And yet do they, notwithstanding all their deep research, fail to meet in one common result; so that we are almost tempted to believe that the subject is too high for man's feeble powers to reach. Yet let them press on; for the Scripture, speaking of the sure word of prophecy, says, "Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed." It is a high and mysterious, but not a for- bidden subject of research, if man, deeply conscious of his feeble powers, will prosecute the search with humility, Others, again, are watching with anxious' eyes the incursions of that superstition which threatens again to desolate our land, and are preparing with holy zeal to stem the torrent ere it break down all our barriers. By public disputation, by private argument, by intense study, by prayer and meditation, they are making ready all the weapons of their warfare to cope with their wily foe. And well does it \       .t    FOR QUIsET HOURS.      9 behove them to gird on their spiritual armor, and to see that helmet, shield, and sword are at hand for the conflict; for they "wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against prin- cipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of .this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." And if they who read the signs of the times are reading aright, this dim twilight which is gradually obscuring our noonday: beam is but the precursor of a midnight darkness more awful than any which the sons of men have yet been called on to witness, - even the dark- ness of infidelity, where neither sun nor star appeareth. May -"He who sitteth upon the circle of the earth," watching in the calm majesty of omnipotence over this chaos of confusion, give to his children wisdom, and knowledge, and strength, and a firm, un- shaken trust in Him, that they may be able to "withstand in the evil day," and look for ward without dismay even to the time when "the heavens shall pass away with a great   10      QUIEJ THOUGHTS noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat." With these high and lofty subjects we pre- sume not to deal. ' We would linger in the shade, and seek to prepare for our fellow-men such quiet refreshment as they will need when they return from the stirring realities of'life. For assuredly they will return; and, as the village matron observed, "if they do not come home before, they will be sure to come home at night." There is a long and quiet night awaiting each one; and when the busy day of life is done, they will come back and gather up again those broken threads of thought and feeling which connect the present with the by- gone past--the shadows of evening with the remembered freshness of the early morn. We would penetrate the glades of thought, and seek to discover those hidden  springs which, rising silently in the heart, steal along unperceived through the thousand channels of domestic life, carrying sweet water and bitter, and influencing for good or for evil to a de-   FOR QUIE'T HOURS.     1I gree perhaps unknown and unsuspected by any of us. The mighty river which, rushing headlong into the ocean, and bearing upon its bosom the fleets which are to change the des- tinies of nations, was once a murmuring brook, i and the infant would lie beside it, and watch its tiny bark as it floated in the sparkling sunshine. And thus the first impulse to some mighty deed, which shall live on when heaven and earth shall pass away, may perhaps be traced back to the silent whisper of some faithful friend, the casual remark, it may be, of a little child. The page of history, which presents to our view the full-grown events,-that excite, as the case may be, either our admiration, won- der, or disgust,--does but imperfectly reveal to us the long chain of hidden causes in which those mighty events originated. Nor can it be otherwise. Man is scarcely a judge of what passes in his own mind; how shall he dare estimate, weigh, and combine the various con- flicting thoughts which, passing through the   l       Ule'! 'jl.'J : Uuwnljl      X mind of his fellow-man, issue at length in actions infinitely good or evil? Who shall say how many shades of feeling, how many influences unseen and unacknowledged, con- tribute to form even the first germ of thought, which, gradually unfolding and assuming a definite shape, shall ultimately issue in some mighty enterprise which shall make the earth to tremble? But be this as it may, time, with all its thrilling interests, is passing away, and will give place to an eternity in which every human being must bear his part. Be it ours to keep our eye steadily fixed on that eternity, and to seek to turn the gaze of our fellow-men upon it too, Be it ours to enter with a gentle step the hallowed precincts of domestic life, and show how every thought, and word, and deed may be made subservient to the everlast- ing end; how selfishness may be detected, and pride subdued, and the thousand noxious in- fluences which poison the springs of happiness be removed from our hearths and homes; how the spirit of love may strew "the nar-    FORB QU li HOURS.              X row path" with sweetest flowers, teaching us to bear one another's burdens, and forbear to- wards one another's faults; how sorrow may be stripped of the false disguise which our faithless hearts have thrown around it, and shown to be, what in truth it is, a messenger from the throne of heaven, entrusted with the high coMnmssion to bring back the   lost and wandering to their Father's home. We would show how this earth, cursed as it is for nan's sin, is still God's beautiful world, bearing upon it the impress of his everlasting love; how, to the ear that will quietly listen, undisturbed by the tumult of worldly passion, there is ever going forth a song of joy and praise,  "From hill or valley, fountain or fresh shade," entering into the innermost chambers of the soul, and shedding a joy and a gladness there with which thie stranger world can in no wise intermeddle. We would bear our willing wit- ness to the truth so beautifully set forth by the great poet of nature,-   "v QV1ST THOUGHTS "That nature never did betray The heart that loved her: 't is her privilege Through all the years of this our life to lead From joy to joy; for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that naught on earth Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith that all which we behold Is full of blessings."  These are some of the objects with which we have penned the following    pages; and we now send them   forth with an earnest hope that they may contribute, though    perhaps in-the feeblest degree,to   cheer, to animate, or to strengthen our   fellow-travellers by the way.  If He who has appointed  to each one   his work, giving to one ten talents, and  to another one, will deign to bless this feeble effort, our  pleasant  labor will not have been in vain. ,     FOR QUIET HOURS.     15  THE ILL-TEMPEiED FAMLY. "Oh tiresome you are, boys!" said Mary Fletcher to her little brothers, as they rushed into the room, and against the table at which she was seated drawing. "I wish you would go away." "Where are we to go, Mary?  John will" not let us play in the dining-room, because he says we disturb him." "O, go anywhere, only do not stay here. I wish it would leave off raining, and I would go out, the house is so uncomfortable to-day." "'Mary," said Catherine, entering the room at the moment, "can you take my place in the school-room for an hIour this morning? I want so much to go out with mamma." "' Really I cannot, Catherine; I must finish this drawing, and I am sure I am not in a humor to go through that everlasting French grammar."   16       QUlrl' TTHOUGHTS "Then, Mary, you are very selfish and un- kind:" and Catherine, in no better mood than her sister, left the- room, and shut the door impatiently behind her. "Julia was crying when I left the school- room," said little Frank to his'brother in a whisper. "Catherine is very cross to-day." "What is Julia crying about?" said Mrs. Fletcher, who overheard the children. "I do not know, mamma, --about     her French, I think; but she almost always cries in the morning." Mrs. Fletcher sighed deeply. She had been left a widow with a large family; and though a sincere Christian, and most anxious to guide them  aright, she was, from an entire want of decision of character, utterly incompetent to the task. She saw and felt that there was something radically wrong in the government of the family; but where the errbr lay she was at a loss to imagine. In seasons of family distress, or in times of sickness, her children were always kind and considerate one to an-, l            d    FOR QUIET HOURS.      17 other; and in all great matters they could prove, by self-denying conduct, that their affection was'sincere; but when there was no immediate call upon their sympathy, when the ordinary routine of daily life presented no event of sufficient importance to arouse their better feelings, they gave way to a petulance and an irritability of temper which rendered their home a scene of perpetual disquiet. Often had the anxious mother mourned in secret over this domestic evil; but the mild yet firm hand of authority, which alone can check these noxious weeds of discontent, had never been put forth in their earlier years; and with the elder portion of the family it was now becoming too late to hope to interfere with much chance of success. On the present occasion she did what she had often -done be- fore; she rose and left the room, and sought in the retirement of her own chamber that quiet which seemed denied to her in the i drawing-room. "I shall go and see Aunt Rachel this after- B  '   18     QUIET THOUGHTS noon," said Mary, some hours after the cir- cumstances recorded above. "I am very glad we have been thrown together'at last. I feel as though we should all like her." "II like the peace and quiet of her house," said John; "- she is always so tranquil." "' Why, as she lives alone, she cannot well make a noise," said Catherine; "but her house is certainly a great contrast to our own." Some of the younger children proposed to accompany Mary; but she declined all com- panionship, and, taking the path through the fields, she slowly wandered on towards Aunt Ra- chel's cottage. Many thoughts passed through her mind; and some were accusing thoughts, for the memory of the morning had not faded away. She was of an affectionate and ingen- uous temper, ready to acknowledge her faults, and heartily sorry when she had given pain to those she loved; but hitherto this feeling of compunction had been suffered to die away in mere emotion, instead of arousing her to a searching inquiry after the root and origin of     FOR QUIET HOURS.     19 the evil. She was now going to visit her Aunt Rachel, with a sort of undefined idea that she could help her; for though she was almost a stranger among the young peoplq her consis- tent religious conduct, her affectionae sympa- thy in all their joys and sorrows, her uniform cheerfulless and kindly demeanor, had already won for her their esteem and regard. She welcomed Mary with much affection; and ob- serving that she was not in her usual spirits, she so wisely adapted her conversation, and mingled with it so many agreeable anecdotes, that Mary, without knowing the cause, felt all her cheerfulness return, and with it an in- creased desire to open her heart to her Aunt Rachel.  "Aunt," said she, "my father loved you very dearly'; and he used to talk of you so Often, that I have felt as if I had known you all my life, though we-have never met until lately. I feel, aunt, as though you could advise me, and I could willingly take your advice, which is not as I feel towards most people," said Mary, smiling.   20      QUSINT THOUGHTS "My dear girl, I shall be so glad to be of use to any of you; I mean, if it please God, to end my days among you; and if in, the few years that may yet remain I can be useful to the children of that dear brother I loved so well, how happy it will make me! You are a large party at home, Mary; and as you are the eldest, a great deal of responsibility must rest with you." i' That is exactly the state of things, aunt; and I am sure I do not meet this responsibility as I ought to do. I know mamma looks to me, and is disappointed that I can do so little to help her; but I cannot tell what to do, and I think that we are not any of us blessed with the best of tempers. I am- sure the last day you spent with us you must have wished your; self in your own quiet home again; but do you know that sort of worry goes on every day?" "There should be none, Mary, in a Christian home, lest the way of truth be evil spoken of. In a large family, my dear, there is need of great forbearance, and the spirit of love should s 1   FOR QUIET HOURS.      21 be very largely shed abroad, to enable us to meet, and to adapt ourselves to, the various tempers, tastes, and pursuits of all; because you know even the youngest child has a right to be considered, and even her little pleasures cared for." " Do you not think, aunt, that, being the elddst, I have a right to expect some degree of deference from my younger brothers and sisters ?" "You would like me to speak plainly, my dear girl, and therefore I will do, so.  The children of one family, be their ages ever so dissimilar, should never, I think, attempt to exercise any authority over one another while either parent is alive. But an elder brother or sister may, by a uniform course of kindness, secure that which is of infinitely more value,- I mean influence.   And thus they may in reality possess a control over the hearts of the younger ones, which is much more powerful than the cold hand of authority, and willingly ceded without any opposition. But after all,   22      QlsEl'T THOUGHTS the great privilege of an elder one consists, I think, in the increased power it gives of doing good. And you know we read that 'even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister;' and should we, who profess to be his faithful disciples, seek great things for Yourselves?" "You are quite right, aunt;" and Mary paused for a few minutes, as though she were doubting whether to confide her next thought to her aunt or no. At length she said, "There is another thing,- aunt, that disheartens me. I do not wish to blame my brothers and sisters, for indeed I really think my temper is the worst of all; but I sometimes think, What would be the use of my trying to exercise forbearance, unless all would agree to do it too? Wlhen all seem to be acting selfishy, what could one do?" "My  dear Mary, shall I remind you that each one of us shall give account of himself to God?   But, even setting aside this grand mo- tive, I believe no one who has not tried can estimate the amount of influence which one   FOR QUIET HOURS.      23 loving, unselfish spirit can exercise in a house- hold. If a cold and gloomy temper can shed its baneful influence around, making all who come within its shadow cold and gloomy too, much more, blessed be God, shall the spirit of Chris- tian love diffuse and spread itself over the hearts around, till it has moulded them in some degree to its own image, and taught them to seek for themselves that renewing Spirit whose fruit is seen to be love and joy and peace. I speak that I do know, Mary, and testify that I have seen. I have not always -been the lonely being you see me now. I was once, as you are, the head of a large -and happy household, and I know that what I tell you is true." " And had you the same difficult materials to work upon, aunt ? " "I do not know, my dear. I had my own evil heart to discipline; and that was a task which needed all my energy, and left me no leisure to scan the faults of others. But this I found, that in proportion as I laid down my own self-love, and devoted myself to the com-    24     QQuTlEl THOUGHTS fort and happiness of others, so did all around seem to minister to my comfort too, and, by a sort of reaction upon the minds about me, to bring a tenfold blessing back into my bosom." "I would give anything, aunt, to be what you describe," said Mary, musingly; "but it does seem a most Herculean labor. I would make any exertion that would render me more useful to mammna, for she does look so anxious and unhappy sometimes. But I can see plainly, from what you have said, that the whole plan of my daily life must be changed." "Why so, my dear?" "Because, aunt, I have not acted upon the principle of love you speak of. I have followed my own pursuits without any reference to the comfort of others; and even in the slight review which my, mind has now made, I can recall numerous occasions when the slightest interruption in these pursuits has made me irritable and unkind." "My dear Mary, let your faults be what they may, want of candor is not among them. Half   FOR QUIET HOURS.      25 your labor is done while you cherish and keep alive this openness to conviction; and believe me, my dear--believe the word of one who has had the experience of nearly half a century to guide her- there is no blessing on this side heaven equivalent to that of a happy Christian home. It is worth any sacrifice to secure it; and it is, I believe, the nearest approximation to heaven that man can find on earth. And you have brothers, Mary; I do not think it is too much to say that the whole tenor of their future lives may be, and in all probability will be, determined by the influences of their early home. In the stormy conflict of life, men are, apt to lose sight of the very form of virtue, and almost to disbelieve its existence; but where there is the sanctity of home to turn to- when, amid the heart's fond memories, there is still a hallowed spot around which every virtue has been wont to cling, however seared the heart my be by sin or sorrow- there is here a ground for hope that it may yet be reclaimed, it may yet be won back into the tranquil path of peace." 2-   26      QUIET THOUGHTS Aunt Rachel paused, -*- her. voice faltered; for this backward glance into past years had awakened many a chord of emotion. Mary rose, and taking her hand affectionately, said, "Thank you, my dear aunt, for all your counsel; you shall see that it is not thrown away. I must go home now, for I have much to think of." "Wait, my dear; I have something yet to give you that I think may be useful. It is among these old papers," said she, opening her writing-desk; "and I think it must be thirty years since I wrote it. Here it is;" and taking out a small manuscript, she placed it in Mary's hand, and said, "Do not read it till you are alone, my dear, and may it be as useful to you as it has been to me." Mary returned home; and when she retired to her room for the night she steadily reviewed her past life, and with. fervent prayer be- sought God to ' strengthen her in her new resolutions. It was then she unfolded her aunt's manuscript, and read therein the fol- lowing :   FOR QUIWT HOURS.      27 IINTS INTENDED TO PROMOTE PEACE AND HARMONY IN A FAMLY. 1. We may be quite sure that our will is likely to be crossed in the day; so prepare for it. 2. Everybody in the house has an evil na- ture as well as ourselves, and therefore we are not to expect too much. 3. To learn the different temper of each individual. 4. To look upon each member of the family as one for whom Christ died. 5. When any good happens to any one, to rejoice at it. 6. When inclined to give an angry answer, to lift up the heart in prayer. 7. If from sickness, pain, or infirmity we feel irritable, to keep a very strict watch over ourselves. 8. To observe when others are so suffering, and drop a word of kindness and sympathy suited to their state.   28      QUIET THOUGHTS 9. To watch for little opportunities of pleas- ing, and to put little annoyances out of the way. 10. To take a cheerful view of everything, of the weather, etc., and encourage hope. ". To speak kindly to the servants, and praise them for little things when-you can. 12. In all little pleasures which may occur to put self last. 13. To try for "the soft answer that turn- eth away wrath." ". When we have been pained by an un- kind word or deed, to ask ourselves, "Have I not often done the same, and been forgiven?" 15. In conversation, not to exalt ourselves, but bring others forward. 16. To be very gentle, with the younger ones, and treat them with respect, remember- ing that we were once young too. 17. Never to judge one another, but attrib- ute a good motive when we can. 18. To compare our manifold blessings with the trifling annoyances of the day. i   FOR QUIET HOURS.  HAPPINESS, pger is one pursuit which has engaged the minds of the sons of men from the crea- tion of the world until now; and it would seem, from their restless and unsatisfied con- dition, that they are not one whit the nearer to the attainment of their object than when first they started in the chase. Happiness is the goal for which they are striving; but so different are the means which they employ, and so ever-varying the course which they take, that we wonder not to hear many among them declare that they have pursued a phan- tom; that, like the mirage in the desert, it has melted away before their approach; or, like the fabled apples of Sodom, it has been " all ashes to the taste." But, in spite of this, happiness has a real   80      QUiwIt THOUGHTS and tangible existence; and if we can secure her at any cost, life-ay, and the longest one - will have been well expended. Let us, then, inquire into the nature of this blessing, for which we are willing to give up all, and carefully investigate the nature of the road, before we too start upon the toilsome race, that our feet stumble not upon the dark mountains, where so many have given up in despair. And let us first inquire- What is happiness? A state of being in which the body and mind, freed from the bondage under which they at present groan, are at liberty to follow the original object of their being,-namely, the perfect law of God. It is to be freed from all care for the present, and all anxious thought for the future; to have a sound, body and sound mind, with all their powers in full exercise, mutually helping each other. Is it attainable in this present world? No; not as a permanent possession. There are various causes which prevent its abiding   FOR QUlET HOURS.      31 here, but the greatest of all is the sin in- dwelling in man's own heart. Why?. Because every sin, every thought of sin, carries with it its own fearful punishment- its present hell; and what joy can exist with punishment? But setting this aside, is there on earth wherewith to satisfy the soul of man? No; man was never formed to derive his happiness from the perishable things of time. His soul is immortal, his views are immortal, though he often knows it not; and he pines, and longs, and pants for an unseen something which he finds not here. While his fetters are on he can dream of liberty, but he cannot enjoy it. Where, then, must he look for happiness? In God, who is the fountain of joy. "In thy presence is fulness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore." "With thee is the fountain of life, and in thly light shall we see light."   32      QUIET THOUGHTS How can man drink from this fountain? He can but catch glimpses of it here in this cloudy world,' or occasionally taste from the streams which flow from it; and this will only be in the path appointed by his Maker. Temptation resisted, self trampled on, sin fought against,--ay, and that with continual warfare,--will at all times give him a fore- taste just sufficient to encourage him; but the very term " warfare" implies toil, and there- fore man must look forward to his rest. Heb. iv. 9. But what right has he to expect it? He has no right in himself, and at God's hand could claim nothing but punishment, for he has thrown his happiness away. But his Saviour has died to reclaim it, and now offers it to him again as a free gift of his infinite mercy: and if man is wise, he will not refuse this, his last hope. What sort of happiness, then, may be en- joyed here? The child of God, who knows what his   FOR QUIET HOURS.     83 future inheritance will be, rejoices continually in the prospect of it. And not only so. The sunshine of God's presence illumines the whole path of his daily life, investing even his com- mon mercies with the radiance of joy. The light, the air, all animate and& inanimate crea- tion, the love of home and kindred and coun- try,-r all are enjoyed by him in a peculiar degree, because all are sanctified by the love of Him who died to redeem us to himself. And in this view, even the performance of his daily duties will be to him a source of posi- tive enjoyment. Regarding himself as part of God's intelligent creation, he delights to think that he may be a fellow-worker with Him who not only has appointed his daily task, but has himself promised to work in him and with him. Trials, which are the inevitable lot of all, will come to him robbed of half their anguish; for he will recognize in them his Father's hand, and he has proved by long experience that "he doeth all things well." "This is the heritage of the servants of the Bx        (   84      QUIET THOUGHTS Lord;" and in this manner is that Scripture verified which says, ' Godliness" has " the promise of the life that now is," as well as "that which is to come." In what will man's future happiness consist? In a, perfect conformity of his will to the will of God; in the restoration of God's holy image upon his soul.   Here he has seen "through a glass darkly," and in all his efforts after holiness he has been continually opposed by his great enemy; but then all con- flict will be over, and in the full meridian light of eternity all the doubts and difficulties which oppressed him here will vanish, like a morning mist, away for ever. His body, too, freed from sin's curse, sickness, languor, pain, and death, will only minister to his enjoy- ment.  He will be employed in the blessed service of his God, for which he was originally created, and for which all his high faculties were formed.  He will feel himself beloved by his Saviour, and the knowledge of this will draw forth all his best affections in return.   FOR QUlrT HOURS.      35 Every faculty of his mind, every feeling of his heart, will find in him sufficient to employ them for all eternity. The glorious book of creation, which he has so admired here, but of which the wisest perlhaps among us has scarce- ly mastered the first page, will be all unfolded to his wondering gaze. The word of God, and the works of God, will then be seen by him to be in perfect harmony, alike emanating from that Supreme Intelligence whose name on earth is "Love." And all this for ever! It is '" an inheritance incorruptible, and un- defiled, and that fadeth not away." Thus maywe form some dim perception of the joy that is set before us; some glimpses of the light which shall dawn upon us in' full glory then. But our finite minds cannot grasp the infinite, even in thought; for "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared fordthem that love him."   836      & QUIET THOUGHTS iIZPAH. 2 SAM. xxL 1- 14. txbingS unto a Jewish mother came, Of strange and fearful import; arnd her heart Died within her, as alone she sat in Her own quiet dwelling, listening the while For the glad voice and merry footfall of The boys, who in the early morn had gone itrom forth her door. The heavy hand of God Was on the land, and famine through its length And breadth was stealing silent on, yet had Not reach'd her threshold: still to her loved ones Could she measure forth the daily meal; still The warm flow of life's young blood was mantling In those cheeks, where to her eye beauty had Set its mark, for they were all she had; and Unto her, life, with its thousand charms, had Gathered in its all of interest in Those smiling forms.

Upon that golden field where all day long The reapers had been toiling to bring in The first-fruits of the ripe barley-harvest, Was sending his last scorching ray upon The uncovered heads and quivering limbs of her 'Defenceless children, - none were there to save. She heard, but spoke not,- grief hath no tongue to speak: The common passions of our mortal life Express themselves in words, and find relief. The shallow waves that break upon the shore Send forth a constant murmuring, but from the Deep and fathomless abyss of ocean Comes no sound. And, O! within creation's Widest range, is aught more fathomless Than the deep well-spring of a mother's love? She answered not, but o'er that lofty brow Came rushing thoughts of agony and fear,   38       QUIET THOUGHTS And consolation of so strange a kind, Despair alone could e'er have whispered it.  None guessed of the wild storm of anguish there, Nor of the heroic thoughts which meeting them Hushed those wild waves to peace. 'T is night, and stillness o'er that summer land Is brooding peacefully, save when the night-bird With discordant cry, or screaming jackal From their secret haunts, break the lone silence. Go seek that mother in her lonely home; She is not there, - it is all desolate. Darkness is o'er it now, and when to-morrow's Sun is riding high, and gilding all the- Homes in Israel with his bright joyous beam, It will be darkness still. Its light is fled. Go wander up the hill of Gibeah; there, Upon a scathed and barren rock, sackcloth Her only covering,- there shalt thou find her, Gazing in fixed despair, but purpose firm, Upon those mangled forms, beloved in death. She may not take them down, but she may sit And watch, and, by the sacred awe of her Fond presence, scare away the hateful birds   FOR QOlET HOURS,       39 That, hovering in mid air, would dare profane The dead. She has no fear; one only thought Pervades her stricken breast, and nothing now Has power to turn her from her high emprise. The weary days and nights pass slowly on. The fervid rays of the hot summer sun Beat on that scorching rock, but all in vain; They cannot drive from thence that self-devoted, Tender woman. At length the autumn rain Began to fall, and it was told the king How on that bare hill-side a mother wept. He had compassion on her, and her sons Had rites of burial. And is there nothing in this tale of woe But the fond record of a mother's love? Look deeper, Christian; there 's a lesson-here Penned by thy Master's hand, and pointed out By his own finger - let it not pass by. Man, in the image of his God create, Fell from his high estate, and in his fall Shattered the glorious image all to naught. , Yet in the broken fragments glittering still Lie traces of Divinity, bright gleams   40      , QUIET THOUGHTS Of what we might have been, had not our great Arch enemy prevailed, and marred it all. And of-these fragments God has gathered one, The brightest, putist, soiled though it be - It is a mother's love, in anguish tried - And placing it before us, bids us learn The glorious lesson of his endless love. "Can she forget her sucking child.?" he asks. We know she cannot, and the answer comes Spontaneous from the heart's believing depths. "She may forget," replies that loving voice; "She may, and yet will I not forget thee." Come hither, worn and weary pilgrim come; Has thy heart whispered Zion's sad complaint, "My Lord hath me forgotten?"Does thy soul Faint at the prospect of life's dreary road, Thy sun obscured, sin thy -companion still, (Unwelcome guest, and hateful though he be,) And sorrow tracking close thy weary feet, And shedding o'er thy path behind, before,' A mist that almost hides the goal from view? O! listen. yet again to that glad voice, "And yet will I not forget thee." "The mountains shall depart, the hills be moved, but yet My kindness shall depart never from thee."   FOR QUIET HOURS.       41 That mourning mother kept untiring watch, While on the accursed tree her children hung. Think who upon the hill of Calvary Once hung for thee, and bore the heavy, curse, Thy forfeit life to save, thy ransom pay. The vengeance which the broken law demands, Morie stern than Gibeon's sternest hour of wrath, Has been endured by One, whom all thy sin, All thy mistrust, cannot estrange from thee. Then cast away thine unbelieving thoughts; His just demand, "My son, give me thine heart," Answer in full, and thou shalt find " the peace Of God, which passeth understanding, keep Thy heart and mind for evermore. Amen."   42 -     QUIET THOUGHTS THE DISHEARTENED STUDENT. "  hI lBAi get up very early to-morrow; and if you are awake, Maria, will you call me?" said Dora Campbell to her sister. "Why will you get up so early, Dora? It always gives you a headache." "Because, Maria, I want to take great pains with my lessons to-morrow. There shall not be one badly done, and then perhaps, I shall win a sweet smile from mamma, such as Helen Murray had yesterday. O, how I did envy her, when her mother threw her arms around her, and called her her own dear, diligent child!" "I think mamma is going out to-morrow, for tilhe whole day." "Is she? But that need not make any difference; we can prepare all our lessons   FOR QUiE'T HOURS,    43 i  ready for her by the time she returns. Maria, do you know, the greatest pleasure I have in the world is to know that I have pleased mamma; but I do jnot know how it is, I seem so seldom to do it. Do you .care as I do?" "I do not know, Dora; I think I do, but -" "But what, Maria?" "I think I used to care more than I do now; but I sometimes feel disheartened, as though mamma did not value my efforts."'  "O Maria, that cannot be; she is such: a dear, sweet mother; it must be ourselves that are in fault. So to-morrow I will try all my powers; and, as the song says, 'If you 're waking call me early.'" The morrow came, and Dora rose with the sun. She was a girl of most affectionate dis- position, of a delicate frame, and sensitive temperament, capable of performing a great deal if judiciously and- kindly treated, but soon discouraged and inclined to mistrust her own powers.  She joined the party at the   / "     QUIET THOUGHTS breakfast table this morning, full of hope and of renewed confidence in her own exertions. "Who has been practising this morning so early?" said Mr. Campbell. "I have, papa," said Dora. "Yes, my dear," said her mother, "I heard you; but you played so fast, and so much out of time, that it pained one to listen to you. I am afraid you will never be a good per- former." "Yes I will, mamma, if you will give me time. I did not mean either you or papa to hear me this morning, and I thought I had shut the door." "My dear," said Mr. Campbell to his wife, "as you are going to town this morning, had you not better inquire about the drawing- master?" "Why really, Edward, I am doubtful whether there will be any use in it; the girls have so little notion of drawing. I have tried them both." "O mamma," said Maria, "have you seen   FOR QUIET HOURS.      45 Dora's last drawing? No, you have not, I know, for she has not quite finished it; but it will be beautiful." "Well, my dear, I hope it will turn out so; but my expectations are very small, I assure you.  Your cousins draw  beautifully, and they are much younger than you." Mr. Campbell gave a pleading look at his wife, for he saw the effect her words were likely, to produce. "Their cousins have a natural genius for drawing," said he, " which very few can boast of. If we ordinary mortals do what we can, it is all that should be ex- pected of us. ' She hath done what she could,'" said he, in a lower tone. "This is the highest praise for woman, and it is ap- plicable to all the duties of her daily life." The party now separated for the morning, and the sisters went into their study. Dora, true to her self-formed engagement, never relaxed her efforts. She wrote and re-wrote her theme, until she thought it was worthy of her mother's perusal. During all the hours   "     -QUIT THOUGHTS of the morning she allowed herself no recrea- tion, and joined her sister at their early din- ner with a flushed face and a wearied look. "O Dora, you must come out after dinner with me; you will work all the better for it afterwards." "Yes 'I will, Maria, for a little while, for my head aches sadly; but I have learned my new piece of music so perfectly," brightening as she spoke; "amid my theme, Maria- -O, I feel sure mamma will like 'it! '? Mrs. Campbell returned home to a late dinner, and remarked 'Dora's; pale and lan- guid expression. "Are you well, my dear?" said she. "O yes, mamma, quite well." "Have you been out to-day-?" "Not much, mamma; I have been busy all day. And after you have dined, you will come into the study, and see what we have been about." The long-wished for hour arrived. Dora placed her theme in her mother's hands, and      FOR QUIET HOURS.      47 with an anxious heart retired to the other end of the room.  Some minutes elapsed, and then Mrs. Campbell said, "You have not taken a comprehensive view of your subject, Dora; and I do not think your illustrations are very well chosen. There are two mis- takes, too, in the grammar, and one in the spelling. I should hardly have expected that at your age. Where is yours Maria?' ' I will bring it, mamma; but I want you to,look at Dora's drawing first, she has fin- ished it." The drawing was brought; and though for a self-taught artist, like Dora, it was certainly a, beautiful performance, Mrs. Campbell's at- tention was directed solely to an unfortunate line in the building which was a little out of the perpendicular. "My dear Dora, one of the most important things in good drawing is the straight line, and here you are sadly at fault. Your trees are very pretty; and the foreground would have looked well, if you had taken more care with the building.'   48      QUINf T HOUGHTS Much more of the same kind was said, and the music,* the translations, etc., underwent the same discouraging scrutiny. All that was really good was left unnoticed, and the faults, such as they were, were brought forward into most prominent view. Dora, too much dispir- ited to speak, slipped out of the room unper- ceived. The greatest effort she was capable of making had proved unsuccessful, and a withering feeling of disappointment' passed over her. Her affectionate heart never once thought of casting blame upon her mother; but Hler resolution was checked, her rising ardor, chilled, and that proper confidence in her own powers, which is so necessary to en- sure success, almost destroyed. And thus it is that mothers of families, and teachers and guardians of youth, are accus- tomed to carry on the great work of moral and intellectual, training, forgetful, all the while of the irreparable injury they are in- flicting on the young and sensitive minds that are placed under their control. They thilnk   FOR QUlWr' HOURS.     4   ' to stimulate the young by showing how faIr they are yet removed from  the standard of excellence at which they are aiming, whereas, if the far-off sumnmit is ever to be gained, it must be by many slow and patient steps, by hopeful encouragement and cheerful assiduity on the part of teacher as well as learner; there must be " line upon line, precept upon  ' precept; here a little, and there a little." "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child." How many of us forget that we ever did so? A long interval has passed away, and the little world of thought and feeling in which- we once lived and moved has faded from our recollection. And- yet the world of childhood is as real and as important to the little beings concerned therein, as are any of the great events which encircle and enwrap some great actor in the present busy scenes of life: as far as results are concerned, much more impor- tant, for it is the seed-time of a future harvest, and from these seemingly trivial and unimpor- 83'       D   50      QUIETl THOUGHTS tant influences the stirring events of future days will spring. Children are keen observ- ers, and often, when we little suspect it, are drawing inferences from the circumstances which surround them, which are so many sep- arate stones in the building of their future character. They are reflective, too, in spite of the atmosphere of gay hilarity in which a merciful God has bid them revolve during all the years of happy childhood; but so delicate are their perceptions of good and evil, so dim and indistinct even to themselves the thousand sources of their little joys and sorrows, that we should be most careful lest unwittingly we brush away the cobweb of feeling they have so carefully spun,-the fairy framework upon which so much depends. We are apt to forget that the mental power of children is as varied as is their outward conformation, and to cast a  reproach upon them for that which is in reality the appoint- ment of One who cannot err.  "To   one he gave five talents, and to another two." Our   FOR QUI'ET HOURS.     51 part, therefore, is simply to inquirq, "Lord, what wilt thou have this child to do?"-what work shall he perform in the great vineyard of the world?  What are his capacities, the leadings of his mind, the nature of his affec- tions? -and then by every means in our power to encourage him to perform his part to the glory of God, the good of his fellow- men, and his own happiness in life. All work is honorable that is done for such a Master; all is important which his approving eye will inspect. This is the principle which will give life and energy to the routine of the school-room; and while it rouses the pupils into action by the assurance that no effort on their part will be lost, the parent or teacher will be reminded also that he is working, not for time, but for eternity; rot for the vain applause of a fleet- ing world, but for the "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."   52       QUIET THOUGHTS- BEAB    AND FORBEAR; OR, THE EXAMPLE OF ISAAC. "And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not; and he called thp name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us." - Gen. xxvi. 22. dy life of the patriarch Isaac presents us with very few   circumstances, and was marked by no seemingly striking events; but the ruling principle of his life shines out very strongly, and furnishes a beautiful illus- tration of the gospel precept, "If it be possi- ble, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."  His character, viewed in this light, is worthy of our deepest consideration; for it is not by one or two great efforts that the Christian character is to be tested, but by the thousand nameless trying circumstan- ces of daily life.   It is, to live in a world   FOR QUI'ET HOURS.     53 where, with few exceptions, "all seek their own," and yet to keep the spirit unchafed, un- fretted, ready to relinquish all and anything, sooner than break the harmony which should subsist among the children of one common parent. And with an evil heart of our own, taking part invariably against us, rising up in its various forms of pride, selfishness, and op- position, and whispering forever the sugges- tion, "This is indeed my right, and why should I relinquish it?" verily it is no easy task that is thus required of us. It is recorded that the Lord blessed Isaac exceedingly, and he became very rich. The natural consequence of this was to excite the envy of his neighbors, and accordingly they took every opportunity of testifying their ill- will. He caused a well to be dug, which was in fact establishing a home in that spot; and, when finished, they raised a strong con- tention for the possession of it. He gave it up and quietly dug another, removing at the same time, his family and household.  The ,.   54      QUIET THOUGHTS same scene of contention was renewed, and he gave up this also. Hie trieda third time, and he was then permitted to enjoy his work in peace) his own rmark on the occasion showing plainly the spirit of love which had pervaded his conduct throughout: , Now the Lord hath made room for us." As- if he had said, 'If God wills that I should remain, he will remove the opposition. This affair touches my own personal convenience only; the glory of God is in no way affected by it, nor the good of my fellow-creatures. By re- linquishing my right I am the only sufferer, and it will put a stop at -once to this strife and contention, which must, from their very na- ture, be offensive to the God of love and peace, and hinder the influence which I, as a professed servant of the only true God, might otherwise possess in this place." And so in- deed it proved; for we read that, after this quiet surrender of his own will, God appeared to him and blessed him, as if in token of ap- proval; and also that the people of the land,   FOR QUIET HOURS.      55 wrought upon by the most convincing of all evidences, the silent testimony of a holy life-, besought him to enter into covenant with them,' ratifying the same according, to the custom of those Eastern nations, and effacing forever the remembrance of the feuds that had existed between them ; for, said they, "We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee." Could we but take a right estimate of the world, of ourselves, and our fellow-creatures, how different would our conduct oftentimes be! We should see, indeed, how deeply the leprosy of sin has marred the characters-and spoiled the tempers of many; but we should also distinctly see how deeply our own are in- fected too, and we should regard one another more in compassion than in anger. It may be that those who cause us the greatest amount of disquiet are themselves lamenting over the force of that disease which it seems beyond their power - to control ; and it would be wise in us frequently to place before our imagina-   56      .QUIETff THOUGHTS tion those same characters divested of all those points which seem to mar their beauty now; to regard them, "not as they are, but as they ought to be," and as they will be when, having put off this body of sin and death, they shall appear in the beautiful garment of holiness. !  Is it not true that the happiness and misery of life often depend, not on the great events which occur now  and then, but upon the small, the unimportant, the ever-recurring tri- fles which form the tissue of domestic life? It is these which give a color to our existence, brightening our path into radiance, or casting upon it a sombre shade.  Every individual has within his power, and in his own sphere, a portion of this influence. Be it ever so small, it goes to form part of the mighty mass of good or. evil, as the ocean which encircles the globe is composed of separate and single ' drops. What is it that mars the beauty, and spoils the happiness, of so many even of our Chris-   FOR QUIE'T HOURS.     57 tian homes? It is selfishness, it is an over- weening sense of our own importance, which prevents us from beholding the great truth that God's glory and man's happiness are in- dissolubly connected, and that, whenever man is engaged in working out his Maker's will, he is at the same time working out for himself an " exceeding and eternal weight of. glory." "This is my commandment, That ye love one another," and "Let no man seek his own." Here is the grand outline of our duty, and in these few words our daily happiness lies en- wrapped. It may be that the point in dispute should in all justice be ceded to ourselves. The well which Isaac dug he most certainly had a right to keep; but to the child of God there is something dearer than his own rights and privileges; and, where these alone, are concerned, he can cheerfully relinquish them all, sooner than infringe that law of love which is more precious to him still. He will reason thus: "God has placed me amidst these circumstances; he knows them all, and he has 3 *   58      QUiil' THOUGHTS bid me serve him in the spirit of love and for- bearance, in spite of them all. It can be done therefore; and if this or that advantage can only be obtained to me through the medium of strife and contention, it is clearly the mind of God that I should forego it.: It may seem an advantage now, but it will not prove so in the end." There are cases, indeed, when the glory of God, or the interests of others, demand that we should persevere through all discourage- ment, through all opposition; but these seldom u occur, and may be regarded rather as excep- tions to the general rule, which requires that, in all questions connected simply with self, we should just go and sit down in the lowest room. Let us leave all this anxious thought about our own honor and dignity, our rights and privileges; they are safer in God's hands than our own, and we had better leave them there. When we have been cured of our spiritual blindness, we shall find that the highest order of nobility in the world of   FOR QUIET HOURS.      59 spirits, the noblest rank there, is composed of those who, on earth, have been content to rank among the meek and lowly of heart, the humble-minded, the peace-makers. Even while here their Master calls them " blessed," and in the kingdom of glory they shall find this blessing increasing and extending through eternity.  .    60      Qullrl' THOUGHTS  THE PRESENT LIGHT. 3i is well when the events of our daily life suggest tous thoughts more abiding than those events themselves. They would always do so if man would not fetterl his spirit so strongly with the things of earth; and He who " knew what was in man" bade us look around, even on inanimate creation, to learn lessons of wisdom for our daily use. Returning to my home late one evening, it was my lot to pass over a tract of desert ground Where no human habitation stood. It was one of those still, dark nights which we sometimes observe at the close of autumn, as though Nature were preparing for her long sleep. Not a star shot forth its feeble ray, no struggling moonbeam illumined the gloom. The last streak of light from the west had   FOR QUIET HOURS.     61 long ago faded away, and whichever way I turned my eyes it was darkness still. I paused a moment, doubting what to do. There was one bright lamp in the distance, and I knew that lamp was near my home. Upon that, therefore, I determined to fix my eye, but the intervening space still remained; and I might stumble over a thousand things before I reached it. But now an unexpected circumstance ar- rested my attention. Looking down upon the pathway, if haply I might guide my foot- steps aright, I found that there was light suffi- cient to take one step with certainty; and, that accomplished, the light extended to the next. It is true, it reached no further than the step I was about to take, and all beyond continued in thickest gloom; but still the light was sufficient to guide me every inch of my way, and I reached my home in safety. And then I considered how close a parallel might be drawn between this and many a passage in a Christian's life. There are times   62      QWUlSl THOUGHTS when difficulties press closely upon him; when duties which he may not avoid are so irksome that he knows not how to get through them; when help is denied, and sympathy withheld. Then, taking all this evil together, he looks forward into the gloom; and feeling his own utter inability, it is not to be wondered at if he sits down in despair. It is true there is a beacon light in the far distance, and he knows that it shines over against his eternal home; but how shall he pass the intervening space! "Thy word is a lamp to my feet": so saith the Psalmist. And what does that word say unto us?"Take no thought for the morrow." Go boldly up to the duty of to-day, and strength will be given for the performance of it. "The morrow shall take thought for the-things of itself."- With to-morrow's du- ties will come to-morrow's strength, and it will be -amply sufficient for the need. The darkness and uncertainty of our pres- ent state of being will not last forever. We   FOR QUlfT HOUBRS.     63 are travelling to a world where all is light, and this thought should cheer our spirits, and animate us to press forward with untiring zeal. And if the track we have to pass be "desert land," only so much the more will it enhance the value of that welcome home which is promised, and shall be given to every faithful follower of our Lord and Saviour.   "      QUIET THOUGHTS THOUGHTS IN    A CHtURCHYARD, bVifte is sounding from the silent dead, Low, deep, and solemn, warning us to tread With hallow'd step upon their grassy graves.

Catherine Arnold was the daughter of a clergyman, and by her father's death had been suddenly thrown upon her own resources to obtain a livelihood. With no knowledge of the world into which she was thus so pre- maturely cast, no previous preparation beyond what a religious education had provided, she was going through the bitter experience which so many of our young countrywomen, in like circumstances, have had to endure. Those affections which in a home of love had put forth all their tendrils, and clung with fondest attachment to every living thing within its hallowed precincts, were suddenly forced to contract and centre within the solitary sphere of her own bosom. This is almost the invari- able effect upon a young heart of a sudden wrench from all it has- been accustomed to love; and even where there is a deep prin- ciple of religion, it is long before the mind acquires sufficient courage to come forth in-   -70      QUIET THOUGHTS cheerful, active usefulness before a seemingly cold, unloving world. She was roused, however, from her reverie: by the voice of a little girl behind the hedge, saying, "Mamma, do let us go over into that field, it does look so pleasant." Catherine turned round, for she thought she recognized the voice of the child, and she uttered an ex- clamation of delight as she beheld one of her oldest friends-one who was associated with her own beloved home and village--standing close beside her ...O0, dearest friend," said she, "how came you here?  I little thought such joy would be mine to-day:" and throw- ing her arms around her, she gave way to a burst of tears, which seemed to belie her words, but were, in reality, the best prepara- tion for the gladness she spoke of. "Go and play, Minnie,"' said her mother, "and. comt to is again presently. See, there are"Miss Arnold's little pupils on the other side of the field; go and join them." The child ran away, and Catherine was            '     FOR QUlJIT HOURS.     71 left alone with her friend. After various questions had been answered, and various in- quiries regarding her old friends and former pensioners satisfactorily replied to, her -kind friend, looking earnestly at her, said, "And you, Catherine, are you happy here?" "Happy! how can I be happy?" said she, as, with a look half reproachful, she replied to her friend's anxious inquiry. "And why not, my dear?" " Because I am among strangers; because I cannot bear' my occupation; because I do so dislike the worry of children; because, O! there are a thousand reasons why I can- not be happy." "Then I am very glad I have come hither, though I shall be here only for a few days; for I am sure, before I leave, I can show you a thousand reasons why you ought to be happy. Have you forgotten, dear Catherine, whose will it is that you should be where you are?" "No, I have not; but I cannot lose the   72      QUk'r THOUGHTS remembrance of the home I have lost.  O! 1.f you could tell how distasteful my life is to me; and the contrast between my present and- past lot is so continually before my mind, that I can think of nothing else. The only pleasant hours in the day are when my labors are over, the children asleep, and I can go to my own room, and enjoy my solitude." "And you will never find happiness so, my dear. It is only a diseased mind that ever attempts it. We were born to live amongst our fellow-men, and to try by every means in our power to do them  good; and it is only when we are thus engaged, heartily and cheerfully, that we can hope to find any re- lief from the cares and sorrows of life, which you know, my dear, in some form or other, attach to us all."  "But- you cannot think how troublesome the children are--the boy especially. I 'am , sure they do not like me, and therefore I shall never obtain any influence over them." "But do you think you have tried to win   FOR QUi1'9 HOURS.      3 them? Children are naturally very action- ate, and very susceptible of kindness. Be- sides, they imbibe, so much the habits and feelings of those with whom they live, that  when they really seem wanting in affection, I cannot help thinking the fault must rest with ourselves." "I do not know-perhaps you are right. And yet, dear friend, I have tried to do my duty here. I have faithfully given up my time, as I engaged to do; I am always with the children, much as I dislike it, but it is nothing but the principle of duty that enables me to go on." "Then, my dear girl, you are not alto- gether right. There is a stronger principle than mere duty that should actuate the Chris- tian,.-even the principle of love. I do not mean love to man, but to God. You are working now as the children of Israel worked , in Egypt,--Just because they were obliged to do it; and if you aould escape from  your duty, you would. But there is another view 4   74      QuE'l' THOUGHTS to be taken of it, which would altogether change your feelings; and until you can see and act with this view, you cannot be happy. But do you like me to advise you so? I am so afraid of seeming to reprove you unkindly, when in reality my heart longs to help you." "O! I am thankful to you - thankful even for your rebuke. Do I not love you most sincerely? and I have no one here to advise me. O, how I wish I could have lived with you! I could have loved your children so much." "You know, my dear, how   I tried to arrange it No; and you know the strong rea- sons which prevented it. It was as clearly the will of God that you should not come to us, as that you should come here; and per- Itaps one reason for this may even now be seen. You must learn to walk alone. Had you been with me, you would have been guided by me; but God would have you look to none but him.  But now for the one great principle we were speaking of just now.   FOR QUIET1 HOURS.     75 All the events and circumstances of this world are, you know, in the hands of our heavenly Father, and it is the Christian's peculiar privi- lege to believe that all things shall work together for his good.  He has no- desire, therefore, to direct his own affairs, because he knows that his own short-sighted policy would be sure to mislead him. He knows he is placed here for a very short time at most, and his great object therefore is, not to secure as much enjoyment as he can, but to work as hard, as he can for that kind Father-that loving Saviour, who is even now preparing a home for him, to which the happiest home in the present state bears no comparison. Now, to bring this at once to bear upon you and your position here. God, as it were, says to you, 'Take these children and nurse them for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' Do not look upon them as necessary evils, to be put out of the way whenever you may lawfully do it; but look upon them as God's children, committed to   76      QJiElT THOUGHTS your care by him. They may one day be your 'glory and joy,' your 'crown of re- joicing, and they will be, if you do your duty lovingly by them. You must pray for them, and with them; you must sympathize' in all their little joys and sorrows, and ac- custom them to look upon you as next to their mother in kindness and love. Does this sound impossible, Catherine?" "No, not at all; I believe you are quite right. But I must throw away all my sad and musing thoughts, if I do this; and I have a greht delight and satisfaction in these solitary hours. I must lift my mind quite out of myself, before I can accomplish any- thing like this; and it will be a desperate effort V' "It is an effort well worth making, my dear. Throw away all those thoughts you speak of, at least for the present. There may come a time when you may safely indulge them; but now, though they look fair, selfishness is at their root.  Throw them all away, and you   FOR QUIJ ' HOURS.    " will obtain in exchange a reality of enjoy- ment of which these solitary hours have been only the phantom. But now tell me about Mrs. Mowhray; how do you like her? I know but little of her, but I am inclined to like her."  "I do not think I know much more of her than you do. She has been very kind to me, but I think she sees that the best way to show me kindness has been to leave me alone; at least she knows I think so." "Well, my dear, let her think so no longer. She would be your friend and confidant now, and I think she would prove worthy of it. She and you have now one interest in these children, and you should work together. Your influence over them will increase tenfold when all you- say and do comes recommended by a i mother's love. And I charge you, Catherine, do not hoard up your own private griefs. I have lived longer than you, my dear, and I have proved that the effect of this is to weaken the powers of both mind and body, until they   78      QUIET THOUGHTS become as incapable of acting as before they were unwilling. Accustom yourself to con- verse with Mrs. Mowhray; tell out your sor- rows to her, and the burden will become lighter each day. Employ every moment of your time either in useful occupation or healthful recreation, and leave no leisure for those painful thoughts which have so harassed you. Thus tcting day by day, and striving to approve yourself to your loving Father by cheerfully walking in the path which heahas laid down for' you, you will find it grow brighter and pleasanter each step that you take. Joys that you think not of will spring up by and by; wayside flowers, that are scat- tered on the Christian's path to cheer him as he walks along. And ever and anon refresh your spirit by looking forward to the 'joy that is set before you.' If our journey be a toil- some one, it is but a journey after all; "and such a haven of repose awaits us! A little further on, and we shall be at home." She paused, and looked at Catherine, whose   FOR QUIET HOURS.      79 glowing countenance showed that her words had not been spoken in vain. "May the Lord bless you, my best friend," said Catherine, 'for all your counsel! You have roused me from my sinful apathy to a living consciousness of my duty. My spirit is strong within me. O gracious Saviour," said she, clasping her hands in the attitude of most fervent prayer, "leave me not again to my own wayward fancies. Let thy Holy Spirit come and dwell with me, to teach me whatI ought to do, and to give me power to do it. I desire to be thine, in body, soul, and spirit; O, enable me to be so now and for ever!" "Amen!" responded her friend.   "And now, my dear, I must leave you; but I have no more fears .for you. You are to visit me, you know, in the holidays, and* I shall long for the time, perhaps, as much as you will. Here come our young ones, and we must all away- ' Now cheerly to our work again, With hearts new braced and set, To run untired love's blessed race.' "   80      QIJIET THOUGHTS She paused, for she was not sure whether Catherine could bear the remaining lines; but she took up the strain herself, and finished the stanza,- "' As meet for those who face to face Over the grave their Lord have met.' Yes, I can act now," said she, " and by God's help I will;" and bidding her friend farewell, she took the little girls by the hand, and, with a happy look and cheerful tone, commenced her return homewards, while her friend stood lingering yet awhile, and  watched the little party as they slowly wound their way up the hill, until she lost sight of them behind the trees which  skirted Mr. Mowhray's domain.   FOR QUIE! HOURS.     81 HOW  CAN I BE HAPPY? PART II. om years had elapsed since the day when, first introduced to Catherine Arnold, we found her with her young pupils in the meadow at the bottom of the hill. We are now to be- hold her under a new aspect;, d we hope our readers will think it an improved one. It was autumn, and the clearness of the atmosphere gave a brilliant coloring to the rich deep foliage of the woods which had only here and there begun to put on the golden tint, that sure forerunner of decay. With a light step and a- glad heart, Catherine was winding her way down a broken path which led to a cottage at the bottom of the glen. A little boy was leaning over a low gate, and as soon as he caught sight of her, he ran into the 4*          F   82      QUIET THOUGHTS cottage, to tell the glad tidings to some one within. . "I thought you would come to-day," said the feeble voice of a sick mall, who yet greeted Catherine with a glad smile as she entered the cottage. "O lady! the sound of your voice is like sunshine on a winter's day. My wife is downhearted to-day, and I have little power 'of cheering her; but you comfort us both, lady." "HLow  can I help being downhearted?" said the wife in a complaining tone; seven months' illness, and no prospect of his earning anything for the family. O, it is very hard that we should be so sorely tried!" "I have brought you some provisions, and some little dainties from your kind friend Mrs. Mowhray, and I am come to read to you to- day," said. Catherine. After a few inquiries after their condition, she took the Bible, and, endeavoring to suit her subject to the especial need of her auditors, she read from the history of the saints of God how through much tribu-   FOR QUIET HOURS.      83 lation we must enter the kingdom of heaven; how the light afflictions of the present time are intended to work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal' weight of glory; how all the events of life, even those which to our short-sighted vision appear most adverse, shall work together for good to those who love God. Then she dwelt with peculiar earnestness on the exceeding love of God as shown in the gift of his Son; and proved to them 'tlat He who , for our sakes spared not even him, but freely gave him up for us all, will with him also freely give us all things that are good for us. The sanctifying influence of these truths was felt by all; and when Catherine closed the book she continued to talk to them, and to turn- their minds with cheerful hope to all the bright points in their condition. She played with the children, inquired into their wants, walked round their little garden, which her, fondness for flowers enabled her to take a real interest in, and left the inmates of the cottage under the impression that, sad fas their lot   84       QUIET' THOUGHTS  sometimes appeared, there was yet much in it to call forth the glad feelings of a grateful heart. As she was slowly returning up the hill, she felt a hand gently passed through her arm, and turning round she saw little Frederick Mowhray. "I want to walk with you, Miss Arnold," said he. "I have been waiting for you some time. My heart is so heavy to-day! O, how I wish I was not'going to school to- morrow!"  - "My dear boy, the first time of leaving a loved and happy home must be a time of trial, it is so to all; but you know this life is meant to be a season of discipline. Were we left to mark out our own path, it would often be very different, but it would not lead us to heaven.'  "But it is so very wretched to leave all I love, and I cannot think why it is a duty; many boys are brought up at home." "My dear Frederick, that is not the ques- tion, and suchll reasoning as this will never ^  * '!         *!  .' '   FOR QUIET HOURS,      85 help you. To you the voice of your father is in reality the voice of God, and nothing but a cheerful acquiescence in his will can make you happy.   Besides, dear, you will- not always feel as you  do to-day; new thoughts, new feelings will open upon you; the great battle of life is before you, and you must take your place, and join the ranks, and fight with the bravest and the best among them."  "What do you mean, Miss Arnold?" "I mean, dear, that if you live,'you will have to fill an important post among your fellow-men. -It is not for you to inquire how you can belt avoid the rough thorns and briars of life, but how you can best prepare yourself for the duties which in all prob- ability wilt devolve upon you. Think how your father is respected and followed; see how his name acts like a talisman, and draws around it the influence of the whole neigh- borhood; even so must you strive to follow his bright example; even so, through the   \ 86      QUIET THOUGHTS difficult path of self-denial and resolute exer- tion, must you show forth the praises of Him whose we are, and whom I think we all desire to serve" Frederick's glowing cheek showed that his kind friend had touched the right chord in his young heart; and he replied, "Then you mean, Miss Arnold, that my school-life is to prepare me for this. O! when I look upon it so it is quite different; I can make any exertion, and I will. But you said just now that I could be happy; and I am sure I do not see how that is possible." "My dear boy, it is not only a possible thing, but it is certain. O Frederick, I speak from experience; I was so miserable when I first came here, and now nothing grieves me. I am so sure that I am just in the condition in which God would have me to be, that I have neither a thought nor a-wish to change. And you will find it just the same, if only you go. on day by day performing with a glad mind just the duty which lies before you.   FOR QUIEl' HOUS.     87 It is the only safe path, and the only happy. one." ' Dear Miss Arnold, were you unhappy? I never knew it; and how often I used to plague you! But now tell me, do you mean that you never feel dissatisfied with your lot in life,-would you not like to choose your own path if you could?" "No indeed, Frederick, I would not; I am so sure I should choose a wrong one. Think how ignorant we are! We do not even know what will happen to-morrow; how, then, can we tell what is best to be done? O no! I am thankful I have nothing to do with it. But now, Frederick, think how much pleasure it is in your power to give to those you love. Tjiink that if by your good conduct you obtain a prize to bring home at Christmas, it will more than overpay you for your present pain." Frederick paused a few minutes, and then said, "I am sure now I have been very selfish this morning, Miss "Arnold. My sisters were sorrowful enough about my going, but I only   88      QUIET THOUGHTS increased their grief by my foolish latnenta- tions; iwish I had not done so." "Then go to them now, dear, and cheer tlhemand encourage them. Your dear mother needs it too, for this has been a dark day to her. We all want help, for we all grieve to lose you." Frederick pressed the kind hand which held his own, and turning down a path through the shrubbery, reached the house by a nearer way. It was late in the evening of the same day when Mrs. Mowhray.,and Catherine found themselves sitting over the embers of the .fire in the little girls' study, long after their usual hour of retiring to rest. Catherine had been performing, as usual, the 'office of comforter. From the bright fountain of joy which was ever springing up in her own bosom, she had enough and to spare for the wants of those with whom in her daily life she was associated. After they had been sitting some time musing over their own quiet thoughts, Mrs. Mowhray said, -    FOR QUIET HOURS.      89 "t Well, Catherine, there is not one member of this family whom you have not cheered and comforted to-day. It was a blessed hour which first introduced you as an inmate within these walls; and among my greatest earthly bless- ings do I reckon you, my kind and valued friend." Catherine returned a look of grateful love, and Mrs. Mowhray continued: "There are many who talk of religion, Catherine, but their lives not being under its blessed influ- ence, its bright promises remain to them for ever unrealized. With you it is not so. To you belong the promises of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come; to you, God's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all his paths are peace; and the gladness of your own heart sheds its blessed influence on all around you, speaking to them, in language which cannot be misunderstood, of the truth and reality of that blessed religion, which has raised you above the cares and sorrows of life into such a tranquil atmosphere of peace and joy."   90      QUIET THOUGHTS Catherine's heart was too full to speak. She could not deny the truth of her friend's statement, though she almost feared to appro- priate it in its full extent. Her mind took a rapid glance over the last two years, and the period of sorrow which had preceded them; and she saw how, in the mingled web of hu- man life, grief and joy are alike subservient to the real good of the children of God; and how those who, in faith and love, place them- selves unreservedly beneath his heavenly teach- ing shall go on " from strength to strength," from joy to joy, until c every one of them in Zion appeareth before God." Christian reader, this is a blessed truth; fear not to take it unto 'thyself. If thy cir- cumstances in life are such as thou wouldst not have them; and yet if, like the pious Fenelon (when standing beside the lifeless body of him he loved best on earth) thou canst say, "( If the turning of a straw could bring him back to life, I would not for ten thousand worlds be the one to turn that straw   FOR QUIET HOURS.     91 in opposition to the will of God "; if this be- the temper of thy mind, thou art rich for both worlds; thou hast found the true philosopher's stone, which turneth all that it toucheth into gold. Thou mayest look backward with grat- itude, and forward with hope, fearing no evil, for God' is with thee; and thou canst not move out of the hallowed circle which redeem- ing love has drawn around thy path. It may be that difficulties perplex thee, that a dark cloud seems to hang around thee, thou needst. not fear; lift up the eye of faith, and behold that which men see not, even the bright light which is in the cloud. Time can bring thee nothing which thy God has not sent; eter- nity will show thee wherefore thou couldst not have done without it.   92      Qt1I'T THOUGHTS THEA CITADEL. in the present season of public excitement, when a foreign potentate, the Pope of Rome, is seeking to domineer in our land, and cast his' iron fetters upon the consciences and understandings of our people, the danger is so palpable, and the insult so galling, that scarcely one can ,be found who does not mingle in some way in the general feeling of indignation. And yet there is a danger even greater- than this, all unsuspected by many of us, and brought about by the very circumstances which seem to have aroused us to a greater vigilance than before. Our great adversary the Devil is very subtle, and his deadliest wounds are inflicted when and where we least expect them. He knowss   t  FOR QUIET HOURS.      93 that the secret of our strength lies in the per- sonal religion of each man's own heart, and that the collective power of the nation is, founded upon individual determination; and he will, therefore, seek to draw us away from the citadel by raising a great alarm outside the gates. .Nearly all are running in one direction to see what is the matter; and many loiterers, who have never joined the ranks before, are now seen to mingle in the general \throng, and raise their voices among the loudest in the cry against Popery. It is very easy, nay, almost pleasant, even for the true servants of God, thus to leave for a time the close and anxious watch of the citadel; for, through the sinfulness of the flesh and carelessness, it is often weary work to stop the gaps, and mend the breaches, and be shut up all the while in the close fortress of the heart, with no eye upon us but the eye of our Commander, and no glory to be won, no sound of gratulation heard, save the low whisper of his approving voice.   "      Qulrl' THOUGHTS And the excitement of this general move- ment is altogether delightful to the natural man. His intellect is roused by the mass of new and varied information which is brought before him; his patriotism is stirred, and his indignation too, at the menacing aspect of our foe ;. his self-love is flattered, and his vanity fed,-for there are public meetings to attend, and public papers to sign, and a degree of importance is attached to his actions which never belonged to them before; and a com- placent feeling of self-satisfaction runs through it all,--for is'he not engaged in the great work of defending the religion of his country? Ahna all this while the citadel of his heart is left open to the great enemy. We would not undervalue the importance of those talents which in this crisis of our history are being put forth in all their strength to cope with the mighty energy and worldly wisdom of our foe. Rather would we thank God, that in raising up among us genius of the highest order, sanctified as it is bf the   FOR QUI'T HROURS.     95 knowledge of the truth, he has given us an earnest that he will be with us in the conflict. But while these stirring spirits are thus watch- ful for our safety, it much concerns us all to return continually to our citadels to watch carefully over our own hearts.   Christians may not leave them unguarded, no, not for an hour; and they can best help this mighty cause by keeping each one to the post that has been assigned him to guard. "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it ate the 'issues of life." Let us look to it that we are depending each one personally on the everlasting Rock, which is the only foundation of the church. Let us look to it that we are showing forth, each one in our daily life, those fruits of the Spirit which alone can testify that we belong to Christ. "Let all 'bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil Speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake liath   96      QWmlETL THOUGHTS forgiven you." Let us study more deeply the word of God, that we may be able to give a reason of the hope that is in us. Let us purify our hearts in thought, and word, and deed, casting out every lurking traitor that might give admittance to the foe. And thus pre- pared, though an host should encamp against us, our hearts shall not fear; we will go forth in the strength of the Lord our God, " for the battle is not ours, but God's." There is an hour coming with sure and stealthy steps upon each one of us: alone must we meet it; alone must we grapple with -the overwhelming realities which it will most assuredly reveal. In utter solitude, in utter nakedness, the soul must stand in that hour alone before its God. Singled out from the crowd in which its .identity was almost lost on earth, the thrilling voice of public sympathy is heard no more ; the tumultuous excitement of external religion is hushed for ever. All the interests of the universe will be to each, in that moment, merged and concentrated into   FOR QUIET HOURS.      97 one single point,--"Upon what have I been depending?"  If, by our influence, or elo- quence, or talents, we have gained the whole world to the knowledge of Christ, what will it avail if we have not committed our own souls to him? This, then, is the vital point; and may God give to each one of us--to the writer and every reader - grace, that now, in this " the accepted time," we may see where our chief danger lies, and fly for safety to the only refuge for sinners, even Christ Jesus our Lord. 5 j    98      QU1HT THOUGHTS TH ]E MUDDY BOTTOM. fth heart of man is like a pool of stand- ing water. Look at it on a summer's day, when not a breeze ripples the surface, not a bird flies over to cast its light shadow on its face. It is so clear, so bright, you may see your own image reflected there. Now cast a stone to the bottom, and watch the effect. The dark mud is rising all around, dank weeds are floating up which you never saw before; the whole pool is in a state of motion, and hardly a drop of water has es- caped the foul pollution. Look at your own heart when all outward things go well. No vexing, crossing care mars its tranquil calm, and you think you see the image of Jesus reflected there. It is so long since sin has molested you, that you   FOR QUll'T HOURS.     99 think it has left you quite, and that all is pure within. Now let a sudden offence come, an unkind, undeserved rebuke; let pride be touched, or self-will roused, and presently all is lost. Like the waves of an angry sea, the poor- mind is tossed from thought to thought, and finds no rest.- The mud is raised from the bottom, and n-ot one corner of that wretched heart is free from its polluting influence. All gentle, soothing thoughts are gone, and one by one the dank weeds are floating on the surface. But do not give it up, it is not alllost. Do you remember the sea of Galilee,^and One who had power to calm   its troubled waters? Go to him; he has done greater things than these. Go to him in earnest, persevering prayer, and wait the result in faith. Again shall his image be reflected there; again shall the sunshine of his love sparkle over the scene. But learn, O man, from thy misery this lesson; for therefore   t00      QUilff- TROUGHTS was it sent. There is no moment in which thy foe may not spring upon thee; therefore watch and be sober. He lieth coiled up in the darkest corner of thy heart; but the Mighty One will give thee strength against him; therefore look to him.

Af was in the autumn, and an epidemic dis- ease had been making fearful inroads both in town and country, when Dr.  ---, an eminent medical practitioner, entered his trav- elling-carriage with the intention of escaping for a time from the harassing toils of his pro- fession in town. Wearied in body and worn in spirit, he proposed to spend a fortnight with an old friend in the country, who had a large family of sons and daughters, and his home was therefore an abode of perpetual hi- larity- and cheerfulness. With this prospect before him, and the soothing influence of the beautiful scenery through which his road lay, the doctor resolved to banish, as far as possi- ble, all thoughts of past cares; and before he arrived at the place of his destination, his      FOR QUIET HOURS.     107 mind had almost recovered its wonted tone of habitual cheerfulness. On the second evening after his arrival at Mr. Grey's house, he was sitting on a gar- den bench under an acacia-tree, watching the sports of the young people, and listening with great delight to the bursts of merriment which greeted him from time to time; but his atten- tion was particularly directed to a young and lovely girl, who seemed only half disposed to join in the active sports of her companions, and every now and then sat down at the foot of an old tree to watch the game she had not strength to play. There was a brilliant blooms upon her cheek, and a sparkling lustre in her Bye; but however imposing these appearances, they were to the practised- eye of the physician symptoms not to' be mistaken, and symptoms too of a disease all the more to be dreaded, because it flatters the unhappy victim with hopes of recovery even to the very verge of the grave. He was following up the train of thought thus awakened in his mind, when his,    108     QUlml THOUGHTS ' Well, doctor, you are- in a musing mood this evening; what grave thoughts can find room in your breast, with those merry young rogues of mine full in view?" "I am of a musing nature, Grey, and can no more help it than those merry young rogues of yours can help laughing at each other; but you will call me an old croaker if I tell you what I have been thinking about." "Well, never mind what I shall call you; you had better tell me, and I will help you to shake off your drowsy thoughts," "I do not think your eldest daughter looks well." , What, my blooming Agnes, the very Hebe of the party? No, doctor, you shall not in- fect me with such gloomy notions. You have been too long amongst the sick and dying, my dear friend, and your mind is tinged with a melancholy hue. Believe, me, there is nothing to fear for Agnes.", The doctor was unwilling to press the sub- ject further at the time, but his conscience   FOR Qul'r HOURS.     109 would not let him dismiss it altogether; so he took another opportunity a few days after, and explaining to his friend the reason of his fears, besought him, if possible, to spend the ensuing winter at Madeira, or if that were too great an undertaking, to remove to some warm   place on the south coast. '"I think, if you meet the evil now," said he, "you may avert it altogether; but if you wait, I do indeed fear for the consequences." His arguments were of little or no avail, the fond father either could not or would not be persuaded. This daughter was the darling of his affections, and perhaps he acted as we are all apt to do on similar occasions; he closed his mind against the reception of a truth which, if believed, would make him miserable. A   few  days after :this', the family were thrown  into the utmost consternation by a sudden and alarming attack of illness which seized  upon Mr. Grey's second  son.  The symptoms were so like those attendant upon   "O -    QuT THOUGHTS cholera, that even Dr. R--  was alarmed. Nothing could exceed the anguish of the afflicted father. He never left the bedside of his son from the first moment of the at- tack. All possible assistance was obtained; all that money could do was done; all that care, nursing, watching, and medicine could effect in arresting the progress of the dis- order was carefully performed by the almost frantic parent, and after the lapse of three days the danger was pronounced to be over. The father received back his child as from the arms of the grave; the danger had been so imminent, and the alarm so great, that the effect was not likely to wear off. Every precaution that could now be taken against a second inroad of the alarming cholera was immediately set about. All food that was thought in the slightest degree to be un- wholesome was prohibited in the house, all raw fruit and vegetables were denied, warm- er clothing was adopted, a freer ventilation through the rooms was secured, and" the A * ,            '    FOR QUIET HOURS.    11i doctor could not suppress a smile when, on the morning of his departure, he saw his friend, with axe in hand, preparing to cut, down a large tree which shaded the windows of his children's- sleeping apartment, because he thought the damp arising from the autumn foliage might be hurtful. "I know what you think, doctor, but I am not laboring under a monomania for all that. You know the old proverb, 'A burnt child dreads the fire."' "Yes, I know it," said the doctor; "but let the child remember, fire is not the only evil to be dreaded." Meanwhile, the winter passed away and the spring came. The doctor went abroad for six months for the benefit of his health, and at the close of the following autumn, returning to England, sought' again his friend's hos- pitable roof. But what a change had one year wrought in that once happy home! The beautiful, the blooming Agnes was gone. The canker-worm had, indeed, been preying on   "2     QUIET THOUGHTS the root, though the flower was so fair to look upon. The sorrowing father awoke to a consciousness of her danger when it was too late to save her; and she faded away and passed from among them with the first roses of summer. We do not mean to pursue this. narrative further; but would draw from it an important lesson, which, in the present aspect of the times, may be useful to many. It is perhaps a condition of our fallen nature that we are all more or less apt to limit our attention to one or two subjects, which by continual observation become so prominent that they appear out of their true propor- tion, and exercise an undue influence upon our minds. When these subjects relate to art or science it is a matter of inferior con- sequence: and perhaps no one ever attains to eminence in any of these without con- centrating his mind in a great 'degree upon the one pursuit. But when the question is    FOR QUIET HOURS.     1 of that vital importance that life or death, the interests of time and eternity, depend upon it, the case is widely different.  We "T may not spend our energies upon one point, to the exclusion of others equally important. Thus, in the present day, we must not act under the impression that because our coun- try is visited by the moral pestilence of Popery, therefore the souls of our people are safe for the present from every other mortal at- tack.   It is true that the Romish pestilence has infected both town and country; it is true that the disease is deadly; but while it is slaying its thousands, there is a disease of worldliness, of utter indifference to all re- ligion, that is slaying its tens of thousands. This is not generally suspected, and by: many is not believed. Its symptoms look like health, for there is so much that is charming in the outward appearance, such an apparent conform- ity to the standard of truth, that we are un- willing to believe there can be danger. But there is a cankerworm   at  the root; and -         R   "4      QUHTl THOUGHTS while our time and attention are all ab- sorbed in- guarding against the dreaded evils of Popery, averting all noxious influences, pro- hibiting all doubtful books, guarding against the most distant approaches of the mischief we dread, this insidious disease continues, as it has ever done,. to creep stealthily along through the length and breadth of the land; and the extent of its ravages will not be known until that great day when the books are opened, and the dead, small and great, stand before -God. With the root of this disease we were all born into the world; the carnal mind is innate in the heart of man; and whether we escape the snares of Popery or no, this disease will be our death, unless we take timely heed, and apply to the Great Physician who alone has skill to cure it. What avails it that we can distinctly see the folly of image-worship and prayers to the saints, when all the while we have an idol of our own before which we bow down every day, and sacrifice to it all our es           At   FOR QUlTr' HOURS.     115 thoughts, and time, and attention? The idol may be wealth, or fame, or the pursuit of science, or the love of some cherished object, -it matters not, it is an idol still; and if it take the first place in our affections, it will shut out Him who should reign there supreme. What avails it that we shrink with abhorrence from all idea of purchasing with money the pardon of our sins, when we are virtually trusting to our own imperfect works, and not to the finished work which Christ has wrought for us? If the one disease is deadly, the other is no less so, and it is of no use to shut our eyes to the danger; it will only lessen, so to speak, the probability of recovery. Now let us hear what our Great Physician says: "Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life , "Him that cometh unto me I will in no(wise cast out."  And again, q' He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him."  Let us go to him, then, that we may be aroused to a sense of our danger, and be awakened from our false   "6     QUIET THOUGHTS dream of fancied security; and placing all our dependence upon him, let us submit ourselves implicitly to his guidance, and thankfully ac- cept and follow out the gracious scheme which he has planned for our recovery; for a voice from heaven has spoken, and well may man listen and adore: "There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved," but only the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

"Mother, I have been studying a very difficult- problem, and I have mastered it." "Well, my   dear boy, I give you joy. A difficulty in any science well overcome is a step gained in knowledge and in happiness, and seems almost to raise one in the scale of moral being. But what are you going to do now?

I would that   FOR QUIEl' HOURS. y   125 I had wings, mother; for the creeping pace of mortals is too slow,for me to-day. I wonder where Catherine is. She must come with me." "Here am I," said Catherine, who entered the room at the moment. "I am ready for a walk. Mamma, are you not going out this fine day." "Yes, my dear, but I advise you and Harry to be independent of me; I am going to call on Mrs. Darby, and I am sure that will be no pleasure to either of you." "You are quite right, mother; I do not think I could bear it to-day," said Harry. "But why do you go?   She is the dullest creature -the sun shines upon, and you are the most cheerful; what can there be in common between you?" "I hope we 'have some things in common, Harry; for she is a true Christian, and indeed she shames me sometimes in her untiring efforts to do good. But, as I said before, you need not come." "aamma, I shall come with you," said   126     QUIET THOUGHTS Catherine ; "I want to walk with you to- day." "Then I shall come too," said Harry. ." I feel too sociable for a solitary ramble." Their walk lay through some pleasant fields and over .a beautiful common. The young people were of lively dispositions, and every object seemed to afford them fresh matter of conversation or amusement. At length they reached Mrs. Darby's house, and found the lady in her garden, busily engaged in potting a beautiful geranium, just coming into flower. "O0 Mrs. Darby! why do you move that beautiful plant? it will look so handsome, with its deep crimson flower, just under the arbutus," said Catherine. , "Ah, my dear, I like it best in pot; and I have moved it so carefully, I shall not in- jure the flower. But come in, for I dare say you are tired:" so saying, she led the way to the house. "I will tell you, ma'am," said the gardener in an undertones to Mrs. Wilmot; "I will tell   FOR QUIET HOURS.     127 you what my mistress is moving that gera- nium for, for she will never tell you herself. It is for poor Rachel Dawson who has been lying ill so long, you know; she is very fond of flowers, and this beautiful plant is going to her cottage." "How kind!" said Mrs. Wilmot. "I suppose, my dears," said Mrs. Darby, "you found it both cold and windy to-day." "O no, ma'am," said Catherine, "I do not think we did. I know we have enjoyed our walk very much." , Ah, well, my dear, perhaps you are right to be happy while you can; depend upon it, increasing years will most surely bring in- creasing sorrow. Do you know," said she, addressing Mrs. Wilmot, "I have had another trouble since I saw you. My son William writes me word from India that his little boy is delicate, and is coming home immediately, and he wishes him to come here until he can provide some other home for him." "Well, my dear madam, and what other *N   128      QUIET THOUGHTS home in England is so fit for him? I am sure this will ultimately prove a pleasure to you." "O no, impossible! I look upon it as a great trial, not on my own account only, but for my poor daughter's sake. Think what she will endure at parting from her child!" "Yes, but nearly all Indian mothers endure the same; and had the child been ever so healthy, you know they must have sent him home in a year or two. No English children can remain in India." "But the responsibility of the child will all lie on me, and I feel so incompetent. An immortal soul to train for eternity!--and supposing I cannot do it. I thought the trials of my life great before, but this has indeed added to them." "My dear friend, do not say so, do not look upon this child as a trial; rather consider it a privilege that God has chosen you as the honored instrument of usefulness and blessing in the world. A child well nurtured is a blessing in any house; for children carry   FOR QUIETl' HOURS.    129 about with them such an atmosphere of joy, that it seems next to impossible for sorrow to linger where they are. And you will find it so, believe me." Mrs. Darby shook her head, and Mrs. Wil- mot proceeded to inquire after the welfare of some poor people in the parish, about whom she knew Mrs. Darby to be interested. "They are improving," said she, " in their worldly prospects, but I see very little change in them as regards better things. The more I see of my fellow-creatures, and the more I discover in myself, the more am I convinced of the deep corruption of our race. Some- times I think my visits are of no use; but I do not act upon these unbelieving thoughts; I know that I duties are ours, and events are God's'; butJI always return from my district with a heavy gloom upon my mind. Nor do I think it can be avoided; do you?" "My dear madam, what you see in human nature is true, but it is not the whole truth: you have looked only upon the dark side. 6*       I   130      QUIET THOUGHTS But I invariably find, that though there is much to discourage in these visits, there is also much) very much, to cheer and invigorate our efforts. I am sure the children in our schools have already begun to repay us. How much more orderly they are in their conduct, and how quiet and attentive at church!" You know I am not disposed to look on the dark side of things. Now I think of it, have you seen our new neighbors yet? I hear they have arrived, and that all is life and anima- tion at the Lodge." "Yes I have; for a friend of mine has come with them, and I was there yesterday, They seem to be a very nice family; but one of the daughters is a-sad invalid." "I hear she has been so for some time; but they reckon much upon her removal to this place, and it is the opinion of' their doctor that she will perfectly recover after a time." ' O! I should say there is no chance' of it. Her countenance bespeaks positive disease. No, I thought as I sat yesterday, and looked   FOR QUlET HOURS.

True indeed it is, that sick- ness, sorrow, and death, tread close upon the heels of youth and joy." "Iy dear Mrs. Darby, we must not indulge these gloomy thoughts.  It is surely time enough to meet sorrow when sorrow comes; we must not forecast it in this manner." "But, my dear madam, it is true, and we may make this use of it, that knowing this world to be so full of sorrow, we shall look forward with brighter hope to a world where sorrow is not." "So we may, and indeed we will; but in tile mean time, life, with its various duties, is placed before us; Iand for myself, I feel that the only way to perform these duties effectu- ally is to carry the spirit of cheerfulness and hope through every one of them. A writer of our own day has beautifully observed,- 'That which hath vexed thee most hath been the looking for evil, And ills that never happen'd have chiefly made thee wretched.'   132   ,  QUIET THOUGHTS And I do indeed believe that half our suffer- ing in this life is caused by anticipating evil, while all the time bright flowers of happiness are scattered around us, in rich profusion, for all who will be at the pains to gather them up." Some more conversation passed, on indif- ferent subjects, and the visitors rose to take leaver Mrs. Wilmot gave one glance at her son, for she guessed very nearly the state of his feelings. They had scarcely cleared the shrubbery, and closed the gate which opened upon the high road, when Harry seized his mother's hand, and excliamed, "Mother, I deserve a ten-pound note; I have gone through martyrdom, and yet I have not flinched. O, I thought at one time I must have sprang out of the window." "Well, Harry, I think it has been a trial of your patience; but, my dear boy, as the realities of life open upon you, you will find more varieties in' your fellow-creatures than you are now prepared for."

I do not know how you and Catherine have borne it; but I feel,--I can scarcely tell you, mother, how I feel, -quite oppressed in mind and body, as though I must run a mile, and forget her very look, before I can recover my equilibrium." "Has Mrs. Darby met with any very great troubles, mamma?" said Catherine. "No, my dear, not that I am aware of. I suppose she has had her share, but nothing beyond, I belike." "Then what does make her so mournful?" "Why, Catherine, I can scarcely tell you. A great deal of her melancholy arises from temperament, I think; for you know natural spirits are not given alike to all, but a great deal more is certainly within her own control; and I do not wonder at your feeling disposed to blame her, for indeed I do think she de- serves it. The only thing is, that we mortals   134      QUIEl THOUGHTS are very unfair judges of one another. We have decided 'that her temperament is in fault, but it is very difficult for' us to deter- mine where temperament ends and respon- sibility begins." "Mother, Fred. Seymour said to me the other day, that the great dislike he felt to turning his mind to serious things arose from the conviction that religious people are so unhappy; and do you know, I think he is right. I cannot imagine why it should be so, but I think it is so." "No, Harry, he is not right, nor are you either. You have both taken the exception for the rule. 'Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' This is a blessed truth; and though the weak- ness and infirmity of our nature may some- times hide it from our view, it is a blessed truth still. If you really want to form an opinion upon the subject, do not take such an example as we have just seen, it is not fair. If you were studying any branch of   FOR QUIET HOURS.     135 natural history -entomology, for instance and wished to find a specimen to illustrate your subject, you would not take up with the first maimed and mutilated insect that came before you; you would seek carefully until/you found a perfect specimen of its' class. And surely we should do the same upon a subject which is of such vital impor- tance to us. I am sure that Mrs. Darby is a faithful disciple of the religion she professes. I know her well; and to me, her daily life, her unobtrusive piety, her singleness of heart, all alike prove it. But these evidences are all hidden from the world; and to the young especially she presents religion under a very forbidding aspect. She has forgotten to let- her light so shineghefore qn, that they may see her good works, and glorify her Father which is in heaven." Harry and his sister now went in pursuit of some beautiful mosses which were to be found in an adjoining- wood, and Mrs. Wil- mot walked slowly on, absorbed in- thought.   136     QUIET THOUGHTS She was deeply. grieved at the impression made by this visit upon her son, for he was of a very volatile disposition, and had hitherto shown rather a disinclination to bend his mind to serious thought; and she was aware that the young are much more ready to judge for themselves upon evidence offered to their senses, than to profit by the expe- rience even of those for whom they have the highest respect and love. She trusted, how- -ever, that time would correct the errors of his youthful judgment; and while she re- solved that, in his home at least, he should witness "the beauty of holiness," she put forth a silent prayer that he might, ere long, have the witness in his own heart to prove, that "godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise, of the life that now is, and of that which ig to come." t  , .

"Well but, mamma, I wish you would tell me something of her history; you seem to know her so well, and neither Harry nor I have seen her, you know, since we were quite little children." i' You remember Captain Williams, Harry; he came to stay with us before he went out to India for the last time. I think he was as   138      QUIET THOUGHTS bright an example of a Christian soldier as can be found in our army. And you remember, too, the painful circumstances of his death." "O yes, mother, I do. He died of cholera at an out-station in India, within a few hours after he was taken ill; and from some cir- cumstances, I forget what, podr Mrs. Wil- liams was left all alone for weeks." "My dear, I believe the anxiety and sub- -sequent desolation of those few weeks were beyond anything that your young hearts can conceive. When she arrived at the Presi- dency, her friends did not know her: they said she looked as though ten long years had rolled over her head." Mamma, had she not two children?" "Yes, Catherine, but she lost her little boy on the passage home; and soon after this the ship was wrecked, or nearly so, for they were obliged to quit it, and the crew and passen- gers were brought home by a peninsular steamer.

"Do you think, mother," and he looked ear- nestly at his mother, and paused before he con- tinued, "' do you think she will prove a second edition of Mrs. Darby?" He looked so very serious as he said this, that Mrs. Wilmot and Catherine burst into an involuntary fit of laughter, which continued to increase in proportion as Harry grew more and more grave. "You may laugh if you please," said he; "but I assure you if it is so it will be no laughing matter to me.  Mother, I would much rather give up the pleasure of this visit to. Malvern altogether, than run the risk of an evil like this; you cannot think what misery it will be to me." "' My dear boy," said Mrs. Wilmot,- as soon as she had recovered her gravity,  " there is no fear of it; you may safely venture, I assure you. I would not send you, Harry, if I did not feel tolerably certain of this."   "O      QUitE THOUGHTS "Well, mother, I feel very anxious not- withstanding; and though I have dreamed of the Malvern Hills three nights, I am content to see them in dreams alone, if they are in any way to be connected with Mrs. Darby or aught like her." About a week after the conversation re- corded above, our young friends performed the journey to Malvern, and we take up their history on the day after their arrival at Mrs. Williams's small but pleasant abode. Harry had hired a pony and was gone for an excur- sion over the lovely hills he had dreamed of. Catherine was sitting in the veranda at work with Mrs. Williams. A spaniel was reclining on a mat at her feet, the hum of bees was heard among the roses and woodbines that clustered around the lattice. Little Flora Williams was running in and out, from the room to the garden, and from the garden back again to the room. An air of quiet cheerful- ness reigned tlroughout the little domain, and Catherine felt very happy.   FOR QUIET HOURS.     141 "Well, dear Mrs. Williams," said she, " do go on. I do love to hear you talk; that is to say," said she, looking timidly at her, 1" if you are quite sure that doing so does not make you feel sad, and rouse up the remembrance of your past sorrows." "No, my dear girl, it does not. I can look back upon it all quite calmly now, and it does me good to talk of it sometimes. I can see so much mercy, and so much cause for thank- fulness even in the darkest part of my career, that when I recall it to mind it seems to give me fresh hope, and fresh confidence in the future. All that has happened has been ap- pointed by One who loves me far better than I can conceive, and I can safely trust the future to him." "But do you not feel sometimes as though you had a long and desolate life before you?" "I think I should have done so, my love, had it not been for the last words of my be- loved husband, his almost dying injunction: 'Do not fancy the world a desert when I am   L42     Qu1W THOUGHUTS onle, my dear wife,' said he 'while there is mne human being in it who can be cheered or comforted by your presence, rouse yourself to active exertion, for the sake of Him who died for you and for me.' And these words act like a talisman upon me, Catherine. Whenever I go abroad upon any message of mercy, whenever I occupy myself upon any home duty, the spirit of my sainted husband seems to hover around me; and while this thought acts with a magnetic power to draw my heart heavenward, where my treasure is, it sheds a bright sunlightht over every earthly object, and gives a zest to the performance of every earthly duty." "Flora says her young cousin is coming to live here Keith you; is this true?" i"Yes, bmy dear; I have been very anxious to bring this about, and I have at length ac- complished it.

She is my own sister's child, and I quite long to have her." "But will it not be a great additional trouble to you'?" " 0 no, I am not the least afraid of that; my only anxiety is the additional expense, for my means are very limited; but I shall part with one of my servants, and then I can do it." "My dear Mrs. Williams, you cannot do with one servant, I am sure you cannot." "Indeed I can.  My dear Catherine, you do not know how capable I am; and my health is so much improved, that I fear no exertion' now;, besides, I think it will be such an advantage to, my little Flora to have a companion. I already think too much of her; and I cannot help it, while she is my only one." "And shall you educate them    both your- self?" "Yes, if my health and strength are spared.  "4 '    QUIET THOUGHTS I am so fond of children, that it will be no toil to me. -Little Mary is only one year older than Flora, so I, shall lead them on to- gether, through the pleasant paths of religion and knowledge.

"I think I shall, once in the week; and I' shall take my children with me, and interest them in the work, and let them share in the- blessed privilege of making the widow's heart to sing for joy." "O, Mrs. Williams, how I wish you lived nearer to us! and then I would come and help you, and work for you and with you:" and Catherine looked up at her friend, and, placing her hand timidly upon hers, she said, "I have never felt so anxious to do good before." "My dear Catherine, the luxury of doing good is a discovery which each one must   FOR QVUlT HOURS.     145 make for" himself; but once made, it exceeds in value all that even this our age of discovery has yet brought to light. To feel that our presence on earth is a blessing to some - that we are not cumbering the ground--is no cause for exultation, but it is a cause for exceeding thankfulness." Some days passed away, and our young friends would willingly have prolonged their stay. Though, in her small house and quiet mode of life, Mrs. Williams had little to offer in the way of pleasure or amusement, yet there was in herself such an indwelling spring of quiet cheerfulness and calm content, that it seemed as though  all who came within the sphere of her influence found themselves as it were within a charmed ring, and could not choose but be happy too. The common duties of daily life became invested with an unusual interest, from the fervent and earnest spirit which she infused into them  all; and Cath- erine was surprised to see her giddy and vol- 7          J   "6     QUiNT THOUGHTS atile brother engrossing himself in pursuits which at home, to say the least of it, he would have called dull and uninteresting.

I am ready, Catherine. Tell Flora to bring her dog, and we shall have nothing wanting to our enjoyment." ' During the walk, Mrs. Williams related to them several anecdotes of Indian life, which almost decided Harry upon being a soldier, and they were chatting pleasantly as they walked along, when, by a sudden turn of the road, they were met by a lady, who, without taking any: notice of the young people, in a querulous tone thus accosted Mrs. Williams:- "Well' sister, it is two days since I have seen you. I think it is very selfish of you to leave me so long, when you know what a life of privation I' lead. But no one thinks of me."   FOR QUIET HOURS.     147 "I am coming to you to-morrow morning, Maria; and I am quite looking forward to the continuation of our book. But you see," said she, pointing to Harry and Catherine, "I have had two new playmates, and I could not find it in my heart to leave them." "Ah, well, but the happy can afford to lose a little pleasure; I have none to spare." "Come and walk with us, Maria, and you- can tell Miss Wilmot all about these ferns and mosses which she is so anxious to investigate, and I am quite ignorant of the subject." "No, I thank you,t I prefer walking alone; besides, I am tired, and am going home." "Who is that cross-grained personage we have'ejust met?" said Harry. "It is Miss'Williams, my husband's sister; but she is nbt like her brother, Harry. How- ever, I think she is happier than she used to be when I first came here. It was partly on her account that I decided upon making this my future home, for her unfortunate infirmity of temper has estranged from her most of her * fl.   "8      QUlEr't THOUGHTS friends. Added to this, she has partly lost her eyesight, and cannot see to read or amuse herself in any way. This makes her life very desolate, and I think it but right to do what I can to cheer and amuse her. I usually go to her three or four times every week, and read aloud some book which interests us both. I am reading now the life of"Sir Fowell Buxton."  "But does she always speak to you in the irritable tone she used to-day?" "No, not always; and, besides, I am so ac- customed to it that I do not mind it." "But if her temper is so intractable, it is wsrely a just punishment to leave her to her- self: it is no more than she deserves." "But if we are to get no more than we deserve, Harry, we shall all come rather badly off, I think. No; we have a better rule than that to go by; and I think a person with a naturally bad temper is in so very pitiable a case, that we ought to feel the same kind of compassion for her that we should for the W   FOR QUIET HOURS.     149 lame or the blind. And in many cases this gentle treatment produces the most happy effects, opening the heart t .kindly feeling, and obliging it, in spite of itself, to think well of the world against which it has been waging war so long. I have been trying to interest her in some useful work, and I lhave partly succeeded, for she has begun to occupy herself in the school of industry in the village; and the consciousness of being useful has already begun to enliven her existence. But she is not in a happy mood to-day, certainly." ' I should think, ill-temper could scarcely dwell where you are, Mrs. Williams," said Harry; " you have some kind of supernatural power of shedding happiness around you. If all good people were like you, I should not keep aloof from them as I often do. But we have some specimens in our village--have we not, Catherine? -that are enough to alarm any one; and I believe there has been a lurk- ing thought in my mind, that the good people and the dull people are synonymous.  My   150,     QUIET THOUGHTS mother has been always a bright exception, but as an exception I have always viewed her. You are just like her, and I begin to think now there may be others in the world too." "There may be indeed, and there are, Harry." And Mrs. Williams could not sup- press a smile at /this open confession of his inmost feelings. The sun was now setting behind the hills, and the little party bent their steps home- wards. To the young people, a new world of active thought seemed to be opening; and in after life, when the faith of a Christian became to Harry no longer a theory, but a blessed reality, he was wont to recur to this visit to Malvern as an important link in the chain of cause and effect, a turning point in the history of his mind, when he had first begun to see clearly the true secret of happiness on earth, namely, the diligent and cheerful performance of our appointed work, by which we may let our light so shine before men, that they shall glorify our Father which is in heaven.

But what is the condition of man without the Gospel? "At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, hav- ing no hope, and without God. in the world." Eph. ii. 12. Are you sure that we were in danger of eternal punishment? *   152      QUvml THOUGHTS "The soul that sinneth, it shall die. Ezek. xviii. 4. "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them."  Gal. iii. 10. But men do not all believe this. "What if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?"Rom. iii. 3. "The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."   2 Cor. iv. 4. Well, then, where this glorious message is believed, what is the  first blessing that it brings? "Recovering of sight to the blind." Luke iv. 18.  And with this new power of vision what do we behold? "Now  mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." Job. xlii. 5, 6. "We   are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Isa.

Matt. v. 4. Will the Gospel bring comfort here? "Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be for- given thee." Matt. ix. 2. "I have blotted out; as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a i cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee."  Isa. xliv. 22. What has been paid for my redemption? "Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold;- but with the pre- cious blood of Christ." 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. ' The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John, i. 7. I understand you; but still, with- this carnal heart, I shall fall into sin again. "Thou shalt call me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from me."  Jer. iii. 19. "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." John i. 12. 7*   154      q1rET THOUGHTS What has placed .me in this new position?

"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children." Eph. v. 1. Is it the reception of the Gospel in my heart that will work this change? "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God'" sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh." Rom. viii. 3. "The law made nothing perfect, but the bring- ing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God."  Heb. vii. 19.

Is the gift of the Holy Spirit included in the Gospel? "' I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth." John xiv. 16, 17. And is this Holy Spirit interested in our salvation? "The Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." Rom. viii. 26. And will these intercessions be effectual? "He ,that searcheth the  hearts lknoweth what is the mind 'of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession  for the saints according to the will of God."

The village clock had just struck seven, and the chime of the church-bell, which came sweeping up the beautiful valley, seemed to linger among the trees that sur- rounded the dwellings of the villagers, as if to arouse them to the conscious enjoyment of a day of rest. The hamlet lay extended along the valley and half way tip a hill which stretched around it in a half circle, and sheltered it from the cold blasts of the north and east winds. Midway up the hill, and surrounded on two sides by. wood,. was a dwelling rather superior to the rest. It was enclosed in a pleasant garden, and the shrubs and ever- greens bore evident marks of a cultivated   !58      QUIET THOUGHTS  taste. Near the open window of a small bed- room in this rural retreat sat Ellen C-- , her head leaning on her hand, her eyes resting on the rich and varied landscape that' lay beneath her, but seemingly combating with some thoughts that would not be con- trolled. A book -lay half closed upon her knee, but it was evident her thoughts were too busy for reading. '"It is of no use," said she, thinking aloud; "it is of no earthly use! I go Sunday after Sunday to this school, and what is the re- sult? I see no fruit of all my labors, nor do I think our children here are one whit better than they were before we began. To thinvk of that disgraceful 'robbery in widow Martin's garden, and one of my children con- cerned in it! And O, how I have tried to win that girl! I do think I shall give it up; one voice more or less is of no conse- quence, and I could be of use at home. It seems almost folly for a feeble girl like me to set herself against the gigantic evils that   FOR QUIE'IT HOURS.    159 stalk abroad in this world of-ours. Again she sighed; and passing her hand over her brow, she seemed to invite the fresh morning breeze that came in at her window to cool her fevered thoughts. A voice seemed to. whisper within her, "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." "But I cannot train them," said she. 'a One day in the week is all that they are allowed, and the good is all lost in the other six." "Cast thy bread upon the waters," whispered the inward voice again: ' for thou shalt find it after many days." She sat musing yet awhile; at length she laid her book upon the table, and throwing a shawl around her, "I will go out,' said she; "my mind is bewildered this morning, but I will go into the garden, and recover my composure there. If my beloved garden do not restore me, it will be the first time it has ever failed to do SO." She went softly past her mother's room, and   160      QulTl' THOUGHTS opening the door that led into the garden, sauntered slowly down the walk. Light gos- samer threads were thrown across the path from the flowering bushes that grew on either side, spangled with dewdrops which shone in the morning sun like strings of diamonds. The lilacs and laburnums were not yet over, and the snow-white clusters of the guelder rose were seen fro mi a distance amid the dark leaves of the evergreens among which they were placed. The air was perfumed with a thousand sweets, and every sound that was borne upon the breeze seemed a message from the God of love to the children of his care.  Unless the mind be burdened with actual guilt, the sweet influences of nature will com- monly exercise a soothing power, let the causes of suffering be what they may. And so Ellen found it this morning. As she wandered slowly on, her heart became lighter, her mental vision clearer, and"Oh, how joyous is this beautiful world! how good is God!" was her sponta.       FOR Q UIlr HOURS.    161 neous exclamation long ere she had reached the boundary of the loved enclosure which was to her as an Eden of delight. Turning a cor- ner of the path, she suddenly espied her young brother lying on the grass, and seemingly in- tent on something that interested him greatly. "What are you doing, Charlie?" said she in a gentle tone to him. "'Hush, dear Ellen," said the child; "do not speak out loud, but come and sit by me, and I will tell you what wonders, I have seen. There is an ant's nest under the lime-tree, and their track is all across the path as far as the old acacia. Well; somebody has thrown a handful ofgravel across their track, and I thought when I first saw it that they would be sure to alter the path, and -go round it. But no, they mean to remove every grain away; and if you look you will see fresh ants coming from all quarters to help. And they will do it too," said the delighted child, "I am sure they will." Ellen sat down by her brother, and was soon K   -'*'-L    -zQUIEl'P THOUGHTS quite as much engrossed as himself. Each ant removed one grain from the heap and re- turned again and again with untiring energy to its work. They did not pause to look at the congregated mass; but each one address- ing himself to his single grain, removed it out of the way with apparent ease. And it was not until the whole obstruction was cleared away that these indefatigable little creatures re- turned to the usual business of their day. Ellen sat and gazed, for to her this simple scene was replete with interest. It contained a deep and important'lesson, and she almost thought her steps had been guided thither on purpose that she might learn it. "How foolish I have been!" thought she, as, holding her brother by the hand, they returned together to the house. "How falsely have I reasoned! What have I  to do with the amount of evil that is permitted in this world of ours? Enough for me   if I am allowed to remove but one grain, and to know that my gracious master will ac- cept even this trifling service. And I am not   FOR QUIET HOURS.     163 working alone, as my foolish heart almost per- suaded me this morning to believe. Am I not one of a band of teachers, who, from all corners of our land, are going forth this Sab- bath morning with -this one sacred object in view?-some plying their hallowed task in the crowded lanes of the dark city; some, like me, in the happier retreats of rural life: per- haps none quite so blessed as I am!"And. she looked around with a loving eye upon the scenes among which her childhood had been nurtured, and which were blending imnpercep- tibly with all the thoughts and feelings of her ripening age, forming a storehouse of bright thoughts and memories, of holy and happy recollections, to which she might revert in after life, when its active duties, and perhaps sad realitiesfshould come upon her in all their overwhelming power.  "What verse shall I learn for you to-day, Ellen?" said little Charlie, as they sat at the breakfast-table.   -"-     UlT lz' l' THOUGHTS "The ninth verse of the last chapter of nalatians, Charlie." "Are you going to the school this morning, Ellen? I thought you said last night you should stay at home.

"'I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God.' There is my   text for to-day," said Ellen, as with her Bible in her hand she entered the porch of the village school-house. And whether she was permitted to realize on earth the fruit of her labors or no, the promise had long since gone forth by One who cannot lie, " Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward." 1 -  f'   FOR QU 1IT HOURS.     165 COMMUNINGS WITH NATURE. ^nfrt is a chord which all-responsive sounds In every human heart, however wild And varied be the lot of man below- The low soft note of sorrow; and it owns The claim of universal brotherhood.

Art thou an exile? from thy father's home Hast thou reluctantly been torn away, To seek in foreign lands for wealth, for fame, Which never to the loving heart atones.

Mysterious is the law which placed us here; Deep and bewildering the thoughts that spring From the dark chaos of our ignorance: An evil heart within and foes without, Watching to take advantage of each step, And bent in solemn league against the soul, Hovering and trembling on the brink of fate.

It were a vain and false philosophy To teach that man can from this sorrow flee. From outward ills he may a refuge find; But from himself he may not, cannot part. And yet the great Physician, who alone Has skill to reach this deep wound of the heart, Who knows what is in man, can sound each chord That vibrates through his spirit, H-e has bid His children to the school of Nature go, And wisdom learn: the lilies of the field, The fowls of air, the firmament's expanse, From east to west, eternal truth' shall teach.

Hast thou e'er thought, Upon this mighty theme? We know not but per- chance The soul hath senses as the body hath:-- Whence came those bright and glorious images? They are not of the earth; Those hues of light, Investing all things with a sunset glow? And whence that deep presentiment of ill, That weighs thy spirit down thy know'st not why? Oh, say not these are visionary dreams! We live amidst a bright invisible, E'en while we' tarry in this world of sense; And they are wisest who can highest rise Above its vain pursuits, its fretting cares.

"The Lord hath sworn- that the Lord will have war with Amalek, from generation to generation."- ExoD. xvii. 16. ;t8 e history of the Jews, from their sojourn- ing in the land of Egypt to their final establishment in the land of Canaan, furnishes a series of illustrations which may be applied to the Christian life; and the New  Testament Scriptures afford us abundant proof, that this period of the Jewish history was intended to be a type of the Christian church in all ages. In the tenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians is given a short summary of these events, concluding with, "Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."  The third and   fourth chapters of the Epistle to the   174      QtUIET THOUGHTS Hebrews carry out the same idea, as indeed does the greater part of this book. The pas- sage of Scripture we have now chosen will, if duly considered, open to us many useful and important lessons. The nations whom the children of Israel were to dispossess, were to have no quarter from their conquerors. 'No protestations of friendship, on their part, were to induce the Israelites to relax in the smallest instance from the law once laid down. War, war to the knife, was to be the watchword of the host. "Thine eye shall have no pity upon them; " "thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them; " and just so far as they followed up this commandment of their God, did success and glory attend them; whenever and wherever they failed, either through want of faith, or a love of ease, or a secret leaning to their idolatry, these nations became to them as God had warned them, "pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides, and did vex them in the land wherein they dwelt."   FOR QUIET HOURS.     175 When the Israelites were in possession of the promised land, we read that not one tribe was free from the persecution of these indwell- ing foes. Though delivered from their bond- age, and enrolled in-very deed among the people of God, they were still harassed by the undying enmity of the people of the land: they had not yet attained unto their rest. Their foes were round about them, and with- in their land; some, like the Gibeonites, ap- pearing in the guise of friends; others, like the Midianites, oppressing them with a high hand, till the spirit of the people was well nigh broken, so that to them as a nation, as well as unto the Christian, might be applied those words of the apostle, "There remaineth there- fore a rest to the people of God." Now let us see how this will apply to the child of God. He finds himself born into this world in a state of mental bondage; he knows not why, nor will all his deepest researches cast any light upon the subject. The Israelite. who lived during the last period of the four   176      QUI LT THOUGHTS hundred and thirty years' bondage in Egypt was equally in the dark as to the cause of his degradation and misery. But the fact was un- deniable; and as the means of escape were now for the first time placed within his reach, he bent all the energies of his mind and body to obtain that freedom which seemed at one time to have been the birthright of his race. The Christian will say with John Newton, "Many will puzzle themselves about the origin of evil. I observe that. there is evil, and that there is a way to escape, and with this I begin and end." Ransomed, then, from this state of slavery by the precious blood of Christ, and "brought from darkness into light, from the power of Satan into the glorious liberty of the children of God," he would fain believe that the .warfare is ended and the victory won. But it is not so.

Now, it is upon this point of the history that we wish particularly to dwell, because we think that Christians so often forget the posi- tion in which they stand upon the great battle- field of life. We are so ready to make a cov- enant with our sins, to believe that, after all, they are not so hostile to our peace; that this jealous temper, or proud self-love, or lax ad- herence to truth, or desire. to outshine others, are not really dwelling within our hearts, they come from a far-off land, and will not do us any real damage ; whereas Scripture every- where speaks of strenuous exertion, of unceas- ing warfare: and the enemy must be formi- dable against whom such continual guard is needful. Oh! truly it is the law of sin in our mem- bers, continually warring against the law of our minds, that has set itself in opposition to God as well as us; it is the Amalekite against 8*         L   178      QUIE' THOUGHTS whom "the Lord hath sworn, that he will have war from generation to generation." It rises up in the heart, in its varied but baneful forms, owning no allegiance to the Master whom we serve, setting at naught the precepts which we are bound to obey, and with a high hand robbing us of all the fruits of our land, even the love and joy and peace which are the rightful inheritance of the, children of God;- and yet we feel no anger against it.. Christian brethren, these things ought not so to be. It is true we cannot extirpate our foes, but we can reduce them by little and little, until they become tributary to us. We cannot hope to be free from their persecution, till we have put off this body of sin and death; but we need not crouch under their dominion, and obey their stern behests, as if they were lords and masters, in this fair inheritance which the Lord our God has given us. Let us put on the whole armor of God, and try our hand again upon them. Gideon was poor in Manas- seh, and he was the least in his father's house, ?,. ' -..

"Surely I will be with thee." And has not the Lord sent us too, and with our commission coupled the same gracious promise, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee?" Away, then, with all our coward fears, and let us enter upon a crusade, each one, against the sins that do most easily beset him. We will have no pity upon them, but destroy them ut- terly; and those which, through the infirmity of our nature, will still cling and cleave to us, shall be our slaves, and we will be the  s- ters. They shall be unto us hewers of wood, and drawers of water; if they will work witlh us, let us turn their service to account. Let tlhe zeal which has hitherto been so watchful for our own interests be directed towards the good of others. Let the intellect, and the tal- ents, which have been cultivated only with a 'view to making us a name among our fellow-   180      QUIET THOUGHTS men, be devoted to the glory of that Name be- fore whom the cherubim and seraphim delight to bow. Let those warm affections which have hitherto been expended upon earthly love,- and that with such entire unreservedness and heart devotion, that our God may well'bring against us the charge of idolatry,-let them be fixed-- upon: the only Being who cannot dis- appoint, and who cannot fail us. Thus enlist- ing all our powers, and watching lest these traitor foes gain any advantage over us, we shall make sure and steady progress in our heavenward course. The anxious and fretful thoughts which have so often impeded our usefulness, and marred our Christian joy, will one by one give way before our determined resolution. We shall walk in the light of God's countenance, and its bright radiance will shine over all the toils and difficulties of - our weary way, till at length arrived at the gate of the eternal city, we shall enter to go no more out.

"Make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be. healed." - HEB. Xii. 13. St!ej  words are evidently addressed to the faithful disciples of our Lord; to those who, amid all their short-comings, are 'still striving heart and hand to walk in the nar- row path that leads unto life. The apostle is making use of that figure of speech which is so often applied in Scripture to denote the Christian's life, namely, a race, and it is observable ithat he speaks of the competitors as, lame.  Now, under these circumstances, it surely becomes the part of a wise man to remove every stone and stumbling-block from his path, and   to look warily that his foot- steps slip not.  t   (   186      QUIET THOUGHTS But is it true that we labor under this in- firmity? Are we really all lame?  Surely    some among us are making rapid progress,   .( and some have nearly reached the goal. Yes, my Christian friends, but if you will take the trouble to inquire, you will find that each one has had his peculiar lameness to contend with, and has been obliged each day to make straight paths for his feet. And if you will faithfully  examine your own footprints in one day's track, you will find the sad record of many a stumble, if not a fall. Weo are not all suffering alike, and therefore it behoves each one to inquire into his own peculiar infirmity, and to arrange his path accordingly; what may be safe walking for you may be most- dangerous for me. That great stone of temptation which you have over- looked, and will probably trample on as a com- mon pebble, will in all likelihood turn my feet out of the way altogether, and therefore I must remove it. And it will not do to do this once or twice; it must be the daily work of a Chris-   FOR QUIET HOURS.     187 tian, for the probabilities are he will never altogether lose his lameness till the race is won. But he may do much to mitigate the evil. By the continued habit of walking in a straight path, the weak limb may be made stronger, and the crooked limb straighter, until in time, as the apostle encourages us to believe, it may be somewhat "healed." Martha Jones is the wife of a day laborer. She has a kind, affectionate husband, and four or five promising children. She loves them tenderly, and would never willingly grieve them; and she has learned, moreover, the blessed value of the "1 one thing needful." But her lameness is manifested in a very irri- table temper, partly occasioned, and very much increased, by a sensitive, nervous tempera- ment. All noise, hurry, and confusion, bring to her positive pain, and really incapacitate her from performing the common duties of life. She well remembers, and will long re- member, one Saturday evening in winter.   QUIET THOUGHTS The morning of the day had been spent some- what idly, and the necessary work which, in a laborer's family, is always heavy, and on a Saturday peculiarly so, had all to be performed in a few short hours of one of the darkest days of winter. She was impatient with her chil- dren, unkind to a neighbor who came in to borrow some article of domestic use; but the crowning piece of her misery, and that which was to her as a thorn for weeks after, was her churlish conduct to her kind husband. He came in tired from his work, before the cot- tage was cleaned or the supper ready, and the only greeting he received was, "O James! do go out again; you are just come to hinder me like every one else." He answered nothing, but looked at her as if he could say, ;' Do I deserve this?" and, laying down a parcel on the table, he went out, and closed the door behind him. That parcel contained a new gown and shawl for his wife. He had worked for some weeks over-hours unknown -to her, and he had just laid out the produce of this   I   extra labor in what he knew would be an agreeable surprise to the being he loved best in the world. Martha's real sorrow that evening brought a ready forgiveness from her husband, as on many occasions it had done before; but this circumstance seemed a halting-place in her life, and she labored hard to discover and re- move that stumbling-block, whatever it might be, which caused her so many unhappy hours. The result was, a re-arrangement of her time, with peculiar regard to her besetting infirmity. She rose earlier in the morning, that the work of the day might be got forward. She brought everything into the most exact order, allotting a certain time for everything, and obliging her- self to devote a small portion of every morning and afternoon to quiet reading and meditation. Hers was a mind that was soon chafed by even the necessary cares of life, and required to be renewed and refreshed by a more frequent ac- cess than others, perhaps, to the Fountain of life; and having made this discovery, she   90,     QUIET THOUGHTS gladly availed herself of it. No inducement could ever again prevail upon her to crowd one hour's work upon another; and now she may be seen every evening in perfect trau- quillity, quietly awaiting the return of her hus- band and children; the one from his work, the others from their school: she receives them with cheerfulness, and the evening meal is one of quiet enjoyment. The children are happy, for their parents are so. The father takes his seat in the chiTmney-corner, and prepares to read aloud, for his wife has her basket of needle-work all arranged, and she has nothing to do but to listen to him. I do not say the evil I have mentioned is cured, but all the outward manifestation of it is gone. She still suffers from her infirmity, but no one else does; and this determined resistance which she has commenced will one day become a confirmed habit, and the effort will be almost imperceptible even to her. She has made " a straight path for her feet." *   FOR QUIET HOURS.     191 Richard Johnson- is the: son of a respected lawyer. He has been well educated, is fond of literary pursuits, and, as far as his time and means will admit, a lover of the fine arts. He has been early led to a study of the Scriptures; and now, having arrived at the age of nine- teen, the light of Divine truth is shining more and; more upon his heart, leading him to choose for himself the narrow, self-denying way of everlasting life. His favorite pursuit is music, in which he has become a great pro- ficient. for his years; and about a year ago he was induced to join a musical club, which met on Saturday evenings between the hours of seven and ten o'clock. The pleasure he derived from these evenings was intense and. all the toil and labor of his profession through the week were lightened by the anticipation of it. But strong as his love of music is, there is another principle in his heart stronger still. By degrees, he found that his Sundays were becoming less profitable. The last notes of the glee formed the first thoughts of his   192      QUIET THOUGHTS waking moments, and throughout the hours of Divine service his mind was completely absorbed by the remembrance of the deep- toned harmony he loved so well. Again and again he strove to recall his wandering thoughts, but in vain. The preacher whose faithful pleadings had found a ready echo in his heart was listened to: languidly; and one Sunday he was induced to give up the service altogether. This awoke him  from his dream; and, tracing back--his wandering footsteps, he found that his loved Saturday evenings had been- the stumbling-stone. in his way. If safe for others, they were not safe for him, and he resolutely determined that night to give them up.  He tried very hard to persuade the members of the club to alter the day, but in vain; so he withdrew his name. His com- panions could not understand his reason, but he .understood it full well, and he has never repented this resolute determination to make "a straight path for his feet."   FOR QUIk'i' HOURS.    193 Joseph Miller was not always the  quiet, sober man he now appears to be, nor was his cottage the scene of domestic comfort it now presents. For some years after his marriage he lived the life which thousands do, " without God in the world."   While he kept clear of all offences which the law of the land could take notice of, the law of God was broken every day, and he heeded it not. Great part of the wages of every week was spent at the public house, where, with his chosen com- panions, he usually spent his evenings. But it pleased God to send a very rough messenger to rouse this man from the dream of folly he was pursuing. The scarlet-fever carried off -his two youngest children, and he was himself attacked by the same disorder, and lay linger- ing for weeks on a bed of sickness. Here he had time to "consider- his ways," and the Divine message thus painfully brought home to him, was, through the blessing of God, confirmed and strengthened by the visits of a minister of the Gospel. 9           M   194      Q1u1 THOUGHTS He rose from his bed an altered man, in thought and intention at least; but the work of reformation is not done in a day. Long and frequent were the struggles, and many the discouraging falls which he underwent. Long habits of thoughtless folly, added to a natural irresolution of mind, and an easiness of temper which more often led him wrong than right, now stood in his way, and he did indeed present the spectacle of a very lame walker. But he was too sincere in his change of conduct to be baffled by these things. He found by experience that his chief trouble was caused by his old companions, who still con- tinued to meet at the: public house; and as this was in the road which he passed every day on his return home from his work, he often found the temptation to join them there irresistible. He therefore resolved to find another way home, and by going round the lane, which led him nearly a mile out of his way, to avoid the temptation altogether. This plan once adopted, he adhered to it; and in   FOR QUIEST HOURS.     195 all weathers, and through all seasons, amid many discouragements, he did persevere, until habit had rendered it an easy exertion. This greatest evil brought into subjection, the smaller ones were conquered without much difficulty. He has since hired a piece of ground, which he has converted into a flour- ishing garden, and here all his spare time and spare energies are expended.  Health and cheerfulness, both to. himself and his family, have been the consequence of these efforts, and he is amply rewarded even now for thus making "a straight path for his feet." Reader, if your heart has gone along with' the recitals in the foregoing pages, you will be prepared to go even one step further. The Christian is not a selfish being; at least, while he is so he has lost the track wherein are the footprints of his Lord and Master.  While, therefore, he is laboring to remove all impedi- ments out of his own way, he will be careful to leave no " rock of offence'" over which a weak brother may stumble or fall.   196      i QuI'i THOUGHTS. Is there any member of your family suffer- ing under the infirmity of an irritable temper? Perhaps you do not know how acutely such minds suffer from trifles which you would laugh at. From continual observation, you can most likely tell what especial things are likely to call forth this besetting sin. Try, if possible, to put those things aside; watch for little opportunities of smoothing difficulties. To you it may be easy, for your natural temper enables you perhaps to see things rightly; while to the vexed spirit little things are apt to magnify themselves into great evils. And above all, let the words of your mouth be the "Iaw of kindness." Let them be as oil poured upon the troubled waters, soothing the spirit while it convinces it of its folly, by the very kindness it so well knows how to appreciate. Oh! it is indeed true that "' a soft answer turneth away wrath," and perhaps we shall not know, until we are ushered into an eternity of being, how great has been the influence which one gentle, loving spirit has exercised   FOR QUIET HOURS.     197 n a household, shedding the mild radiance of ts light over all the common events of daily ife, and checking the inroads of discord and in by the simple setting forth of that love vhich "seeketh not her own," but which suffereth long, and is kind." --   ^ QuIET THOUGHTS THE VOICE OF GOD. dirIJt is a melody in deepest grief That harmonizes with whate'er is calm And beautiful in Nature.

"Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and over- threw the tables; and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise." -John ii. 13-16. there is no one, on    reading this passage, but would feel indignant at the profanation  of God's holy house, and would enter most fully into the righteous indignation which dictated our Lord's conduct on that o- casion.   But has the thought never occurred to you, that were our Saviour to enter any of our places of worship now, a scene of the same kind, in effect, would strike his eye, that so offended him then?   FOR QUIET HOURS.     201 Man is so the creature of sense, that he will not look further than his eye can see; and if that is not shocked by any gross or flagrant act, he concludes at once that all is right. But- he forgets that "' God seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appear- ance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." Two fields of observation are at once laid be- fore us here. The one dazzling, delightful to our natural senses, but all unreal; the other is truth, for the God of truth has his eye perpet- ually fixed upon it, and it would be well for us to turn our gaze upon it too, for eternity may hang upon the issue. Come, then, with me into yonder crowded building, and let imagination come along with' us; for, if rightly directed, she will serve as a handmaid to truth, and will draw away for us the veil which hides the visible from the in- visible, while we are seeking to place the things - of time in more fitting relation to eternity. What a noble pile of architecture! and what a multitude of people are here assembled! 9.*   202  -    QuilT' -THOUGHTS Silence reigns among them, and the most per- fect order is observed throughout the length and breadth of the building. Here are no buyers and sellers, no tables for the money- changers, nor' seats for them- that sell doves. Surely there is nothing here to pain the re- flecting mind. Let us look deeper, for in those secret/recesses of the heart, which the eye of God can penetrate, there are perhaps "chamibers of imagery " as mournful as those which were presented to the purged eye of Ezekiel, as he sat musing in the land of his captivity over the fate of his beloved country. Who is that sitting in the front gallery, in costly attire, with that young family of sons and daughters looking up to her for guidance?

The position-which; sought after as an additional means of pro- moting God's glory in the world, would have been a laudable object of pursuit-has by her been desired only as a means of increasing her own ephemeral importance in this short-lived scene. Self is the centre around which is re- volving every thought, while with her lips she has just uttered a mechanical assent to the prayer which beseeches God "to deliver us from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy." But whose is, that furrowed brow  sitting under the gallery, grown old before his time? He is a tradesman, and well thought of by his fellow-townsmen, for he pays his dues, and appears regularly every Sunday in that pew. O  neighbor, would that your secret thoughts could bear a  closer inspection'! They are dwelling  with fond complacency upon that unfair bargain which you made the other day, about those damaged goods, by which you became so many pounds the richer, and your poor neighbor so many the poorer. The   204      QUIET THOUGHTS money will not benefit you, for God's curse is cleaving to it. And now he is speculating and turning over in his mind how he may invest this money to the best advantage. Scheme after scheme is weighed and thrown aside until his mind is completely absorbed in the thought of his glittering treasure. O! is not the money-changers' table here? 'Do you see that youth, with his high, In- telligent forehead, in the pew near the pulpit? He seems to be listening attentively, and taking his part in all that is going forward- seems only! His mind is deeply engaged, but not in devotion. He is calculating a mathematical problem which baffled him yesterday. The examination-day at college 'is approaching, and honors await the successful candidate. Fame is the secret idol before which his young heart bows; and while the phantom is luring him on he sees not the real and rich blessings which are offered to him to-day, and he will not have  them because he desires them not, and will not, ask for them.

Well has she done to come to this house of prayer, for she has a helpless young family; and who can guide and guard them but God? No, she is not praying to him, though he is waiting to be gracious. His ear is openj but she is not asking for anything. Her thoughts are in her home, and she does not make an effort to call' them back. All her petty cares and anxieties are rising up like a fog between her and her God; and though the invitation, "'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden," is sounding in her ears, she will go home un- refreshed, and bear the heavy burden of the week again all alone. O anxious mother! your thoughts are natural, but they are not rightly indulged here. Jesus would not suffer even doves in his holy temple. Who are those two young sisters in that large pew alone? - They are of the same height, they are dressed alike, and to the outward eye e       QUIET THOUGHTS there is no difference. O! they are not alike. The elder of the two is wedded to this world, and all its gay fascinations. She has passed the week in dissipation and folly, and the sound of last night's revelry 'is still lingering round her heart. The voice of flattery has found a ready echo in her bosom, and she heeds not the warning voice which says, "The grass withereth, the flower fadett;-but the word of our God shall stand forever." She is one of the congregation, it is true; but her spirit is not here, it is wandering over scenes of past folly, and expatiating on others yet to come. But was not her sister in the crowded ball- room too?  No, she was not there. She has learned to see things as they are, and to weigh them in the balance of the sanctuary; there- fore is the gold of this world nothing but tinsel to her. She was gathering around her her scattered thoughts, and in the silence of her chamber bade them prepare her /soul for the Sabbath which was fast approaching. All that   FOR QUIET HOURS.    207   had grieved and pained her spirit in the week should be forgotten now, for the tranquil hours of the morrow would make amends for all. She believed with old George Herbert, that On Sunday heaven's gate stands ope, Blessings are plentiful and rife, More plentiful than hope; and, in the glad anticipation of all that she should ask for, and all she should receive, she closed her eyes, with the Sabbath-calm already stealing over her heart.' And now   she is happy, her spirit is at home, for she is com- muning with the Father of spirits, apd she is asking in His name who said, "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do." O! why do we not all ask' too?   And now let us pause, and, taking our eyes off the hearts of other men, let us turn them in upon our own. If there be any truth in the foregoing sketches, will not our own hearts acknowledge a likeness? And may we not thus detect the sin which, perhaps, Sabbath   QUIET THOUGHTS after Sabbath, has thrown a cloud between us and our God, so that our prayer could not pass through, to reach the sunshine of his presence? It is only thus that the meditation can be profitable, for man may not judge hs fellow-man. But let this thought be ours the next time we enter God's holy. house, that he is standing in the midst, and that to him that assembly presents, not a variety of outward form or costume; but that in each one he sees what is hid from others,- "that awful thing, the naked human heart." No thought can be hidden from his view, no one corner can be excluded from his searching gaze. "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do," All that we have so carefully concealed from our fellow-men, and almost from ourselves, is laid bare before him; and though this thought in itself would be most terrible, we need not shrink from it, for he is come on purpose to heal and to bless. He is the Great Physician of our souls, and he invites us to come to him, and bring each man   "the plague of his own heart." It cannot be too bad for him to heal. When the whole head was sick, and the whole heart faint, he said, "Come now, and let us reason together: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;" and again, "I will heal their backsliding: I will love them freely."  Sin is our worst evil, so we will bring that first; but we will also bring all our sorrows, and anxieties, and cares. We are invited to do so, by Him who has offered to bear the heavy burden himself alone. Let the broken-hearted come, for Jesus is " sent to bind up the broken- hearted." Let the weary come, for he says, "I will give you rest."  Let the ignorant come, for he says, "I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way-wherein thou Aouldest go." Let the poor come, for he is "anoint- ed to preach the Gospel unto the poor." Let the anxious come,- he who is looking for- ward into the dim future, and dare hardly trust his God with its unseen cares,-and he shall hear those blessed words, "Cast thy. N     210   ,  QUIEk' THOUGHTS burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee." Thus only shall we make the Sabbath a de- light, and appropriate its rich blessings to our- selves.' Thus only can we realize our Saviour's description of the " true worshippers," for it was when conversing with the woman of Samaria upon this very subject that he spoke those memorable words, "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."

Xi. 12. f there be any truth in these words of Scripture, then is it a matter of equal cer- tainty that a large proportion  of nominal Christians in the world will never attain the kingdom of heaven at all. If those who would enter in must "strive," nay "agonize" (as the original word means); "if the righteous scarcely be saved;" if he who would win the victory must fight, 'not as one that beateth the air," what shall we say to the half-hearted, languid, listless being, who, while he knows that the Christian life is a warfare, will not make one sacrifice of time, or ease, or self- gratification for it, or if he does so, thinks it a hardship? Verily, we must say that he does I :    FOR QUIET HOURS.     217 not really believe the truth at all. It is not thus we act in the affairs of this life. We put forth all our powers to obtain some cherished object; aye, and we gain it too, for we have strained every nerve, and concentrated every thought, and turned every circumstance to ac- count, until the difficulties are surmounted, and the victory won. We know the great difference that exists between the things of earth and the things of heaven. We know that "the gift of God is eternal life," and that in the great matter of his soul's salvation, man has no purchase- money that he can bring. "The redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for- ever."  But the same Scriptures that declare this, declare also that we must "work out our own salvation with fear and trembling." They speak of resisting " unto blood," and of the re- deemed as of those which " came out of great. tribulation." While, therefore, we thankfully acknowledge that to Christ alone we owe the inestimable     218      -QUlhT' THOUGHTS' boon of everlasting life, let us work for it with as -much diligence as though it depended -wholly on our own exertions. ." The violent take it by force." Let us, then, with a holy violence push aside every earthly obstruction that would come between us and this great object of our' desire. Let us " press forward toward the mark." "Let us lay aside every weight'; S'-let us' " count all things but loss" for the prize. Let no act of self-denial be counted too great, no exertion in the path of 'duty' be deemed impossible. Let it be the first thought of our hearts on rising, the last prayer on our-lips ere we sink to rest. If ease, or comfort, or the engrossing love of any earthly object should draw off our attention, 'or beguile us with its enchanting wiles, oh! let us cast it all away, for others are pressing on, and we must go on too. We have no time to lose, no strength to spare. The gate is open now; but if we linger, it may be closed for- ever. These thoughts were suggested and brought   FORB QUIEL HOURS.    219 strongly before my mind by 'a circumstance that was related to me a short time 'ago. It was trifling in itself, but the principle it in- volves is one: of paramount importance, and applies with equal force -perhaps with greater -to' the things of heaven as to the things of earth. The reader shall hear the' anecdote, and judge for himself. In one of the large towns in the south of England, near which a nesw railroad was about to be formed, there lived a poor widow, who, having exceeded the average term of human existence by eight or ten' years, was content to give up all hope of- further enjoyment on earth, and 'was quietly awaiting her dismissal in faith and hope, in a small back room in one of the lanes which skirted the town. 'As this poor widow received a regularallowance, she was in no fear of want, and sought only to pass her days in quiet and repose.. Long had 'she been' able to enjoy this wish, when ' all on a sudden' a new and unexpected state   '20     QU1sr 'l'rIV uuu-a f things arose in the parish. Twelve or fifteen lundred railroad-workers, arrived, before any accommodation had been provided for them; md though the huts of the peasantry had already nearly doubled the number of their inmates, the demand for house-room was still greater than could be supplied. The high wages of the workmen enabled them to offer higher rents than the old tenants could pay, and, one after another, many were compelled to quit, that the new comers might be ad- mitted. Among these was the poor widow I have mentioned. Several of her friends had taken refuge in barns and out-houses, but she was too old to venture upon this, and too feeble to look out for herself, and with an aching heart, and many a sad foreboding, she took up her abode in the house of a married dauglter, where there were a large family; and as they only owned -two rooms amongst them, there  was no chance of her obtaining one moment's  . quiet by night or by day. Her Bible, which   FOR QUILET HOURS.    221 had been her greatest comfort, was left un- read; she could not pray, for she had been ac- customed to pray alone, and habit to the old is in truth " a second nature." Her spirits be- came worn, her temper irritable, and it was evident to all who knew her, that a contin- uance of such discomfort would speedily put an end to her life. The district visitor to whose charge this portion of the parish was committed, having known the old woman for many years, felt much compassion for her, and thought over every possible means by which she could re- lieve her from her present situation. The only thing wanted was one small room, but this one thing could not be procured. Those who knew'best the condition of the poor fami- 'lies, assured her it was not to be found. The policemen had spent whole days trying to help the wanderers, searching out every nook and corner of the town, put all to no avail. How- ever, the compassion which the poor widow' had aroused in the heart of the visitor was not    QUIET THOUGHTS to be set aside by difficulties; on the contrary, they seemed 'to arouse her to a more deter- mined resolution to give herself no rest, until she had accomplished the object of her desire. She told me that she could not account for the strong impulse which urged her to an amount of exertion and fatigue, that the occasion itself scarcely seemed to warrant.- For my part, I look upon:this, and many other similar cases, as the evident working of God's hand in the fulfilment of his promises towards his children: "' Let thy widows trust in me."  "The poor committeth himself unto thee:: thou art the helper of the fatherless."  "None of them .that trust in him shall be desolate."  God has ever made use of human means to bring about .the great purposes of his will. v Sometimes he employs men to execute the sentence of his wrath upon guilty nations or individuals. Sometimes they are his messengers of mercy to bring joy to the desolate heart, and comfort -to the mourner; and happy they who are thus employed!   Perhaps if we were more fre-   quently in the attitude of patient watching, if in a self-denying spirit we would lay ourselves out more for the -good of others, so that when God is looking out for some one to do his gracious bidding we could say," Here am I, send me," we should more often be sent upon these messages of love. .. But to continue my tale. It was a hot summer day whei my friend first set out upon her labor of love. She went through one portion of the town, up the streets and down the alleys, still meeting with the same discouraging, reply. The next day was passed in the same manner, and many succeeding ones; and though the chances of success seemed smaller each day, the spirit of hope waxed stronger and stronger. There was a strong persuasion in her mind to this effect: "There is a room in the town, only I have not yet found it."- With this conviction no reasoning could avail, and no ridicule could deter her.  Even when her 'home duties demanded her attention, the Predominant   224      QUIlTr THOUGHTS thought ran through them all; and though her friends and family seem to have been very lenient to her, I think they must have looked upon her at this time as laboring under a species of monomania. One morning she rose as usual, and as she revolved in her mind in what direction she should bend her steps that day, she remembered that, it was the weekly examination at the national school, and that she was expected to 'take her class. "This is a slight hindrance," thought she, but at the appointed time she went. While engaged in questioning the class upon arithmetic, a thought struck her. "Children," said she, ' do any of you know of a vacant room in the town?" They looked astonished; the ques- tion was certainly not in the book. "No," they replied in a listless, careless tone. "I will give a reward to any girl who will bring me tidings of one to-day." 'This roused them considerably, and a visible interest was excited among them.  "There is just a chance," thought the teacher; and finishing the lesson,   FOR QUIVI' HOURS.    225 she dismissed the class, and returned to her home. But now her work was done. She had put the finishing stroke to it without knowing it.' In the course of the day one of her young pupils arrived with her mother, and begged to speak with her.. "-I have a room, ma'am," said the woman; "I would not let it to stran- gers, but it is quite at your service." I need need not say that the agreement was soon made, and in the course of the following day the old woman was carefully removed thither in an easy-chair, and all her little goods and furniture sent on before her. It was a pleasant little parlor, looking to the south, under the shelter of a hill, quite removed from the noise and bustle of the town, and there was a small garden of herbs and flowers in front., Here the old woman gradually recovered her health and tranquillity, and hither I think my friend will repair, whenever she wants a spur to her diligence, or an encouragement to persevere in any lawful undertaking. 10' e         o '   226      QUllT THOUGHTS And now, reader, what shall we learn from this? If it be worth our while thus to strive for an earthly object, the success of which must ever be doubtful, how much more should we strive for that " inheritance incorruptible," which is really promised upon the faith of One who cannot lie. If when God bids us "work out our own salvation," he is pleased to add the gracious promise, " for it is God that worketh in you," shall we say there is any evil too stubborn to be subdued, any im- pediment too great to be surmounted? -' If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us." "Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it." Our great enemy may hinder us, our bosom sins may plead against us, the failure of others may dishearten us; but what avails it all if we are but firmly re- solved to "' go forward?" Christ's promise is, i"To himr that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God." 'Blessed promise!   FOR QUtE" HOURS.     227 though our earth-worn spirits can scarcely reach, even in .thought, the glimpse of glory which it unveils, yet as a beacon star of hope it stands in the record of truth, and he who runs may read. If these thoughts should serve to rouse one sleeping soul, to quicken it to more active ex- ertion, or to cheer it on a toilsome and painful path, the story of the poor widow will not have been told in vain.   228     ,. QUIET THOUGHTS" "OOK Al HO0ME. '-' IitB. my dear," said -Mr. Tracey to his ' wife, as they came out from service one Sunday, "what a very good sermon we have had! I do not know when I have been better pleased; indeed, I have enjoyed the whole service, have not you?" "Why, no, indeed I have not," said Mrs. Tracey in rather an irritable tone. "George has been so extremely tiresome that I have had no comfort at all. He has been fidgeting the whole time, and looking about him as though he had never seen anything of the kind before. I think if I have spoken to him once, I have spoken to him twenty times." "I am sorry for it, my dear, but it was hot to-day; perhaps that made him restless." - "My dear husband, do you forget that   FOR QUIET HOURS.     229 George is seven years old? He is no baby now, and I am    quite sure he could have understood the chapters at:least, if he would have given his attention. For my part, I would rather leave him at home, than suffer him to behave so irreverently. I wish you would speak to him." "'Why, my dear, I think that is more your province than mine, while he is so young. Perhaps I should make too grave a matter of it."- Mrs. Tracey looked as though she thought  that impossible, and after a short pause the conversation turned to other matters. Little George in the mean time was walking on with his sister, and looked wistfully behind him from, time to time, as though he had an intuitive perception that something was going wrong. Mrs. Tracey was a woman of quick temper, with a  strong sense of right; and, as is often the case with characters of this temperament, was apt at the first view of a subject very   280      QUI' THOUGHTSv much to overrate its importance. It is true that master George had been unusually trouble- some that day.  His mother well knew that he was quite able to control his restless feel- ings, during the period of divine service, had he chosen to do so; but, at the same time, the offence assumed a much graver aspect in her mind than it really deserved. She went into the house, and, according to her usual, custom, retired to her own room for half an hour be- fore she joined the family at the dinner-table. Accustomed for many years to that most diffi- cult duty, self-examination, and with a vivid perception of the truth, even when the knowl- edge of it was painful to her own self-love, she began to recall the service of the morning, with the view of impressing it more deeply upon her memory:  What was her surprise and grief to find that, with the exception of a small portion of the sermon, and some few expressions in the prayers, she could bring to-- her mind no connected view of the service at all. Idle thoughts, home duties, future (t   FOR QUIET HOURS.     231 anxieties, each in its turn had come (unbidden it is true, but still they had come) to dissipate her mind, and turn it from the great realities for which she had entered the house of prayer. Self-love whispered the excuse, " It was your troublesome child that distracted you." '"It is a false excuse," replied conscience; "the fault is in your own ill-disciplined mind." '" And so this is the fruit of my self-exami- nation," thought she. " I have been blaming my child when I am tenfold more to blame than he. If I, with all my experience and knowledge of the truth, cannot keep this way- ward spirit from vain and idle thoughts, how can I expect my thoughtless boy to do so ? Besides, he at least has been honest, which I have not been. His volatile temper has been visible to the whole congregation,(while I have passed for a devout worshipper. My God, for- give me," was her mental prayer, " and keep me from  harsh judgments of others, when I do so much need thy merciful forbearance myself."    282     W1iST THOUGHTS  "May I come in, mamma?" said little George, as holding the door in his hand he thrust half his little face through the opening. "Yes, my dear." "I have brought you a rose, mamma;" and he held up a beautiful moss-rose, as though he would bid it intercede for him, and soften his mother's feelings. But he had no need. She passed her arm gently round his waist, and looking earnestly at him, kissed 'him. "I was naughty to-day, mamma, I know T was." "Yes, my dear, you were. I suppose you find it very difficult, George, to keep your restless little limbs quiet for so long?" "Yes, mamma, on these hot days I do. But you must have been hot too; and will you tell me how it is that you can sit so still, and be so good. You are never restless." "Why, George, as to sitting still, of course I can do that, because I have acquired the habit; and you must acquire it too, my dear. It only needs aln effort, and you have done more difficult things than that. But sitting    FOR QUIET HOURS.    233 still is a very small part of our duty, after all. The. hardest thing is to keep the thoughts quiet; and I acknowledge that I find that very difficult." "Do you, mamma? Do you really mean that you are ever like me?" and putting one leg upon her lap, and his little arm round her neck, he seemed to think this newly discovered likeness had made his mother more precious to him than ever. Putting his face close to hers, he said in a low tone, "Mamma, I will tell you what my thoughts were to-day. I fancied I was driving my new omnibus, and I thought my feet were the horses, and I;made that'noise when I wanted them to go very fast. But you do not think about such foolish things as these?", "No, dear; but I think of papa, and you, and Mary, and what I shall do for you next week. I do not mean to do it, George, and it makes me feel very sorry when my thoughts have been thus employed." "And what do you do, mamma, to pre- vent it?:"   234     QUlETl' THOUGHTS "I ask God to help me, dear; and I watch more narrowly the next Sunday, that I may not be led away again." "I will do so too, mamma, and you shall help me; and I will not be surly, as I was to-day." The dinner-bell now rang, and Mrs. Tracey and her little boy entered the dining-room together. Mr. Tracey looked at them, and needed no assurance that all was at peace be- tween them. After the cloth was removed, and the children had gone into the garden, Mrs. Tracey said, "I have been hasty to-day, my dear husband. I wish you would rebuke me when you see me so angry about trifles." "I will, my dear,- when I see any need to do so. At present I feel more disposed to learn from the quiet example of my dear wife than to teach her. And I thank God, with all my heart, who has bestowed upon me stucl a gentle friend, and upon my children such a faithful guide."   FOR QUIET HOURS.     235 WILL IT STAND THE FIRE? "0 mamma, what a very pretty new dress you  have put on!" said. little Mary, as her mother entered the drawing-room one evening. '( Yes, my dear, it is very pretty; but that is all that can be said for it. It will not stand the fire," added she in a lower tone, and as if to herself: " it will be among those things of earth which will be' burned up; therefore it shall have no more thought than it deserves." The child did not seem to comprehend this last remark, arid continued the game with her little brother, which her mother's entrance had for a  few moments interrupted. Her elder sister, however, who was sitting at the table, engaged in some piece of work, looked up confidingly at her mother, and pointing   236 -    QUIET .THOUGHTS to her work, said, "This will stand the fire, mamma; do not you think it will?" "Yes, my dear, without a doubt," replied she'; and- by the glad interchange of look and tIt:bught which passed between them, I was sure that these few words- had reference to some previous conversation which had been held between mother and' daughter that day. Upon inquiry, I found that the work upon which my young friend was occupied, was a warm garment for the child of a blind woman, who resided in the neighborhood, and thus I obtained a clew by which the whole mystery was unravelled. The train of thought which was thus awakened, however, was not to be hastily dismissed. I saw that a great truth was embodied in those few remarks, and I laid it up in my mind, to be afterwards examined -at my leisure, if- haply I might draw from it some guiding or restraining power, to forward me. in my daily walk through life. Scripture is the foundation of all truth; and if we wish to establish any point clearly and   FOR QUlJr HOURS.     237 firmly in our minds, it is upon that stone we should lay the basis of all the 'after structure we may choose to build upon it. In the book of Malachi we read, "Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when "he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire." And again, "Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts." In the third chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians we 'read: "Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall de- clare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any malln's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a re- ward.   If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss.' In the third chapter of . the Second Epistle of Peter we read: "The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."   238      QUIETr THOUGHTS ] This, then, is the sure and certain prospect we have before us; and the inference which the Apostle draws from it is this' "Seeing then that all .these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?" We are living in expectation of a great event,' even the destruction, or rather the purification, of this earth by fire ; and it is as certain as: its former destruction by water. The men who lived in those days were warned of their .impending doom as we are; and' as their unbelief in no way made void the threat- enings of God, then, neither will our careless- ,ness or unberief now. Witli the world around us we have most of us little to do. - They' are many of them, we fear, living as they did in the days of Noah, of whom it is recorded, that i, they did eat, they drank, they bought,' they sold, they: planted, they builded," and' that without reference to the impendin'g calamity. But with ourselves; and with those dwelling in our own immediate households,' we have   FOR QUlET HOURS.     239 much to do ; and if indeed we have subscribed our names as servants of our gracious Lord and Master, it behoves us to look narrowly that the daily work in which we are engaged is such as will stand the fiery ordeal to which all human works will be subjected. Now, in the examination of this question we have much to consider.  Man is a compound being, made up of body, soul, and spirit, with faculties and powers, moral, intellectual, and physical.  These were all given to be used and exercised for the benefit of man and the glory of God; and there is not one of them that may not in this manner be'made sub- servient to the great end for which man was created. It is sometimes stated, and we think erro- neously, that it is beneath the dignity of an immortal being to occupy or interest himself much in anything that does not bear a  direct reference to the great eternity for which he knows he is destined; and under this impres- sion, many an active, capable, and cheerful &   240 .    QUIET' THOUGHTS spirit, sent into the world with power to guide, to encourage, and to bless its fellow- men, has become gradually dispirited and helpless, and at length perfectly useless. Gifted perhaps with a mind of high order, conscious of a mental power superior to many around, most gladly would it expatiate over all the wonders of creation, and bring home a per- petual increase of knowledge and of joy. And this surely is what its Maker intended it should do. But under the mistaken impression before mentioned, the intellect, that splendid gift of God, which,' sanctified by his Spirit, would bring to his altar the most costly offerings of all, is often treated as a rebel, or, at best, but a suspicious and dangerous servant, whom it is necessary to overawe and subdue. Nor does the mistake end here.   While living in this earthly tabernacle, the body will claim and should receive its due share of necessary care. We may talk very loftily about matter and spirit, and consider it be- neath the dignity of an immortal being to   FOR QUIl HOJURS.     241 make any great provision for the former, but it can resent most fearfully any neglect of its positive rights; and those who know the mys- terious influence which it holds over its heav- enly companion will not risk the painful retri- bution which such neglect may bring. The Scriptures speak of the believer under various sinilitudes, and among them, not un- frequently as a temple or building: "Ye are the temple of the living God." Your body is "the temple of the Holy Ghost." ," Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house." And not without reason  does the Spirit of God thus speak to us through the images of our daily life. He knows that our hearts are still hovering among the things of earth, and he condescends to come  down, and of those very things to make a chain which shall draw us up to heaven. The image now before us is a most apt illus- tration of the subject we are considering. A building is formed not of one material, but many; it proceeds slowly, and it may be un- "          p   242      QUIErt THOUGHTS der various discouragements. The builder desires to make it not only durable, but beau- tiful, and to this end he gathers around' him all that skill can devise, or art suggest. He will feel with David, "The house that is to be builded for the Lord :m[ust be exceeding mag- nifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries;" and, like him, he will summon all, from the highest to the" lowest, who are subject to his sway, and invite them to " con- secrate their service unto the Lord." During the erection of .the 'building, also, there will be many things employed which will be thrown aside afterwards, though they may be very useful now. There will be a scaffold- ing all around the'Wilding, which, though it may hide its fair proportions for a time, is yet indispensable to; raise it to the height and mag- nificence it is intended to reach. But when the building is complete, all these external aids and superincumbent materials will' be cleared away. They have done their appointed work, and are wanted no more.   FOR QUIET HOURS.     243 The application of this is obvious; and it only remains for us to consider deeply whether we are in reality building up a temple for the Lord, whether the grand object of our daily life, that which we aim at and desire above all things, is to glorify God "in our body and in. our spirit, which are God's." If not-if the world, in any of its deceitful forms, still claims our hearts and thoughts - we may not conceal the truth which the word of God boldly de- clares: "The day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts." But if, indeed, we have begun to consecrate ourselves as a holy temple unto the Lord, "Jesus Christ hnself being the chief corner stone," then every occupation in which we engage will bear some reference, direct or in- direct, to the prevailing object of our thoughts. We shall not need to ask whether this or that pursuit be lawful; we shall know full well whether it fits or unfits us to carry on our great work.   With an: enlightened con- science, set free from  all disquieting and   244      QUIET THOUGHTS slavish fears, we shall strive to make religion a lovely thing in our-- families and our homes; gathering around us all that is beautiful in nature or in art that lies within our reaclh, and winning the young to rouse up all their facul- ties, and joyfully exercise them, not for them- selves, but forj;God. And when this transient state of things shall pass away, let not' the thought disturb us that these pursuits are perishable, and will pass away too. They have done their appointed work, and we want them   no more.  They were but external aids, the scaffolding around the building, and may well be dispensed with when the building is complete. Happy, thrice happy, if in that day the great Architect will claim it for his own; enrol it as " a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."   FOR QUIET HOURS.

If this were true, We could not dare to die; we could not trust Our loved and cherished ones, as now we do, Confidingly beneath the sacred sod, e To slumber the last quiet sleep of death. Oh! thou hast wronged the gentle messenger Who comes to fetch the Christian: robed in light, Fresh from the atmosphere of hope and joy, He throws its balmy radiance all around The dying soul, making it long to go,- Not to the grave. Oh, lift thine eyes on high! Far, far among those radiant orbs of light, There is the Christian's home, and angel songs Are hymning now their gratulating welcome. He is but putting of his'earthly garb, And folding up his cumbersome apparel, That it may lie within the peaceful grave, In God's own treasure-house, to wait the time When, formed anew by his creating hand, Mortal shall put on immortality. Even--the grave has lost its terror now; Its darkness is dispelled; its gloom is gone:. For He, the Lord of light, has entered there,- Our Elder Brother; and, though trembling once,   FOR QUIET HOURS.       247 Fearless we enter now. He opened wide Its narrow gate, and forth in glory came. And hark! his, voice from heaven speaketh now: "I am the Resurrection and the Life; "Because I live, therefore shall ye live too; "And where I am, there shall my brethren be." ,4     "I never can bear the worry of this home! It is such a painful contrast to the -peaceful enjoyment of my last five years. My dear, dear husband! little do you know the grief and anguish I endure. A whole twelvemonth! What shall I do ?" 'And Mrs. Ferguson leaned her head upon the table, and wept bitterly. Soon other thoughts followed; but they were scarcely less painful. " I thought I was proof against such trifles as these. What a half-hearted Christian I am! I thought ex-- ternal evils could not touch my inward peace; and now I find I am weak, -beaten down in the first encounter. What shall I do ?" Such was the mental soliloquy of poor Mrs. Ferguson, when, pained by some very   unkind conduct in the drawing-room, she had fled to her own chamber to relieve her over- charged heart. She did not titter her griefs aloud, for she was much too miserable to speak. Lately returned with her little girl from. the Brazils, where she had left her husband, she had, in compliance with his wishes, accepted the offer of a home at the house of her maternal uncle. He was a most kind old man; but not being possessed of any acute powers of discernment, he was inclined to believe that all things went on right at all times. His hospitality was unbounded; and, in addition to these two new inmates, he had offered the shelter of his home to a young widow, his niece, who, with her three spoiled children, kept the house in perpetual disquiet, and imagined herself the most important per- sonage on the face of the earth. His own two daughters were quite old enough to guide the house; but they possessed neither temper nor capacity for so difficult a charge. The reader may imagine that in this ill-assorted manage   250      QUIlT THOUGHTS it was no easy, matter for the most right- minded person to steer her course without meeting with many and great difficulties. Mrs. Ferguson, however, was not a woman to give way, for any length of time, to I state of feeling so desponding as we have described. United to a husband who was in the highest sense of the word a Christian, she had learned, both by precept and example, the wisdom and the comfort of submitting her will to every change of circumstance which in the provi-. dence of God might occur; but she was now placed in a new and very trying position; and though every child of God is ready to acknowl- edge that the small daily events of life are as much the appointment of our kind Father as the most important, still we all know this is much easier to believe' in theory, than to carry out in daily practice.     & I do not know what methods my readers may be in the habit of adopting, to rouse and quicken their sluggish souls, when inclined to fall back or faint by the way. If they are in   FOR 'QUIET HOURS.     251 earnest, some method, I am sure, they have. Has it ever occurred to you, dear reader, to go out, as it were, from yourself, and, looking upon your individual character as a thing apart, to turn censor upon it, and summoning reason, knowledge, judgment to the conclave, force them   to return an unwilling verdict against the offender, self? All true Christians possess two principles, called, by the Apostle Paul, flesh and spirit; and most of us are con- scious of this. Within- our own breast resides a judge, who will not be corrupted, and can- not be mistaken; he holds his court at all times, and every thought, word, and deed are subject to his control. Nbw, the Christian has no wish to escape from this; and it is useful sometimes, Then alone with our own hearts, to bring in the aid of language, either in writing or speaking aloud, that we may state the case fairly, and bring before our purified mental vision ourselves as we really are. Some such method as this Mrs. ]erguson   252     QulETl THOUGHTS had been in the habit of using; and it was not long before she roused herself from her passion of sorrow, and began to take a calm view of the circumstances in which she was no wplaced. She drew a writing-table before her, and sketched on paper the following col- loquy with her own heart:-- TALENTS RECEIlVED FROM GOD. The knowledge of salvation; sound body and mind; influence of character; my pre- cious child; and temporal mercies in rich abundance. TRIALS TO BE ENDURED. Absence from my husband; domestic dis- quietudes of many kinds; a very anxious and irritable temper; total want of sympathy ex- hibited by those around me. With these materials, what does God de- mand?  * *    FOR QUIET HOURS.     253 That I should render this household a nursery for him, in which every kindly thought and feeling should be cherished and-- maintained. What sort of influence do you possess? No direct influence, because the assumption of it invariably produces ill-will; it is indirect, and can only be exercised when for the time I can shake off my own irritable temper and self-love. What effect do the wrong tempers of others produce upon you? They chafe my spirit, rouse my pride, cause my tongue to sin, and I sink down in my own estimation and the estimation of others. What do you tlinlk of this? I hate myself for it. No amount of provo- cation should be able to touch an immortal spirit. An angel would pursue his course un- shaken, and so ought I. What ought to be your motive in influ- encing the conduct of others? I should seek to discover what line of con- Y   254      QuIET THOUGHTS duct will best promote the glory of God, divesting myself, as far as possible, of all self- interested motives. This is extremely difficult, and I hardly ever do it; but in proportion as I can accomplish it, I find the blessing of God accompany me. How do you view the opinions of others? I find myself judging their opinions harshy, when they do not coincide with my own, making myself a sort of standard of right and wrong; and I often show this in a manner that must be very offensive to those around me. Have events ever proved your opinion to be wrong? Very often, and for some time after I am humble in consequence; but this feeling soon: fades away, and my overweening pride grows again. )How ought you to view the difference in the natural gifts of those around you? I should consider that each one, is- as God made him, and that though his tastes and.   FOR QUIET HOURS.     255 pursuits are very different from my own, they are equall, important in  the sight of God, and, it may be, more useful to the world. When do you find yourself best able to pro- mote the happiness of the household? When I am quite well, in good spirits, with a hopeful temper, and a disposition to make the best of everything. Can you do anything to bring about this happy state of things?         I certainly can, because the two first con- ditions, health and spirits, very much depend on constant occupation and daily exercise; and the two last, though partly dependent. on the same causes, very often have their secret origin in, something  infinitely higher, but which is also in my own power. How so? I mean that the habit of constant, fervent, and persevering prayer, amid all discourage- ments and all disquietudes, is the surest means of attaining  to that peace of mind, which   256     QUIET THOUGHTS brings hope and cheerfulness, and all the blessings which follow in their train. i It seems, then, that these influences are entirely under your own control. . O no! not, entirely, only- in a measure. I am a weak and imperfect creature, depend- ent on a thousand influences which I neither 'know nor understand; and oftentimes all the energies of my mind and body melt away before my disappointed vision, and I have no power whatever to recall them. Do you find that those things which cause you most pain in the conduct of others, are those which are most offensive to Almighty God? No; I am sure I do not. It is those offences which are committed against myself, that I find so hard to bear; and it is these which remain longest in my memory. But should not the glory of God be the Christian's first thought? Most assuredly; and those who sincerely endeavor to promote it, will find their own happiness wrapped up in it.   FOR QUIET HOURS.     257 How do you think we shall view trials in the other world? With unmingled gratitude.  Even now, in our wiser moments, we can almost see the benefit; but then, with our mental vision purged from  every film, we shall distinctly perceive that sorrow and trials are, as it were, the filtering stones through which we must pass, before we can be transformed into the glorious image of the children of God. You mentioned prayer; what sort of assist- ance may be derived from it? I think there is no circumstance in daily life which may not be brought under its influence. Whatever evils we are suffering under as present, whatever we dread for the future, may be brought before the mercy-seat of our Father, and we shall soon find their aspect wholly changed. Either they will be removed, or, which is a perfect .equivalent, are shall be rendered so capable of enduring them that the pressure will be no longer felt. our view of things, too, is by nature a very    258     QUIET THOUGHTS distorted and untrue one; and this constant communion with the Source of all truth will do much to clear away these false impressions, and show us things in their true proportions. Thus far wrote Mrs. Ferguson; and as she wrote, and thought, and reflected, a heavenly calm seemed to return upon her spirit, and the evils which had appeared so insurmount- able before, faded away in the distance. Her glorious position as a child of God stood in bright prominence before her; and time, with all its light afflictions, weighed once again but a feather in the balance. Before the footstool of her Saviour' she humbly bowed, and, with?ervent supplication and earnest faith, besought him to strengthen her weakness, to pardon her sin, to increase her faith, to inspire her with holy hope and confidence in him; and thus armed with the panoply of heaven, we need not doubt that she returned into the great arena of life, pre- pared for whatever her heavenly Father might appoint, and realizing each day, more and   FOR QUIET HOURS.     259 more .the blessed promise made to those who will take upon them the mild yoke of the Saviour: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you."   260     QUIET THOUGHTS ,  * .. THE DISTANT ECHO. "ff3bW I have no influence whatever, cousin Marion; you are quite mistaken. You have been talking to me as though I held a station of importance in the world, and I am just nobody at all." "We are all of importance, Bertha; and every action we do is linked on to all that is gone before, and gives a color and a tone to all that is coming after." "Well, I think you are right as far as con- cerns myself individually; all I wish to impress upon ybou is, that my conduct is not likely to influence any one else; it seems to me quite absurd to imagine such a thing." At this moment the door opened, and a young man entered the room, saying rather hastily,-   FOR, QU1IET HOURS.    261 "Well, Bertha, when you and Marion have finished your long colloquy, TI suppbose you will attend to me. I have been calling you for the last five minutes, Marion is in a   . preaching vein, I am sure, by her look, but I have no time to listen to her now; my horse is tired of waiting already. Are you coming, Bertha, or are you not?" "O yes, Herbert, I am coming with you most certainly. I wish Marion would not look so grave, though; her face will haunt me like an unquiet spirit all the afternoon." "Stay with me, then, dear Bertha, do." "Not I," said the giddy girl; and giving her cousin a playful kiss, she bounded out of the room to prepare for her drive. It was Sunday; and Janet, Bertha's waiting- maid, having seen her young mistress into the carriage, returned up stairs to prepare for church. As she went slowly to her room, these thoughts passed through her mind: -"I have been to church this morning as well as Miss Bertha; why should I go again? I am   262      QUIE'r THOUGHTS quite sure Miss Bertha would not do wrong, and, therefore there can be no harm in my going out this afternoon as well as her. I will walk to Hurst Farm, and, see Richard Blake's mother, and inquire whether his sister has gone to service yet." A:nd Janet did walk to Hurst Farm, and found many of her friends assembled in the old farm kitchen. They were discussing some point with great interest when she entered, and there seemed some difference of opinion. "We are planning a pleasant and most inno- cent excursion, Janet," said a young man, the foremost of the group, "and I cannot persuade my grandfather that there is no harm in it. We want the wagon and the team, to take us down to the river, and then we. are going sailing, and we shall return by moonlight. Come, use your influenced; what do you say? There is no harm in it, is there?" "I don't know," said Janet, " but I should think not. My young- lady is gone out driv- ing with Mr. Herbert, and she would not have gone if she thought it wrong."   FOR QUIElT HOURS. S   263 "Is she?" said a grave old man ho sat in the chimney-corner. "Sure, our bet ers ought to know. I wonder at it, though;" then in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, " it may be I am growing old, and would keep the-lyoung ones too strict. Do as you will," saidiLe ; "I will not interfere about it. I don't want to spoil your pleasure; you may have the horses, but, poor things," dropping his voice again, -" it is rather hard upon them; God gave them their holiday." The party was "soon arranged, and Janet agreed to accompany them.  Will' Forester, the shepherd's son, overheard the scheme, and begged so hard to join them, that he was admitted; and this evening's excursion was to him the commencement of a ilong chain of broken Sabbaths, which darkened his path, and galled his conscience to his dying day. "Well, if we can't have your boat, we will get another," said Richard Blake to as sturdy boatman, who looked vexed and half   264      QUIET THOUGHTS irresolute as he stood) on the bank of the river. I, don't say you can't have it," replied the man ; ' I only say let me get home again in time for me. and my comrade to go to evening church. We have not missed these five years." "Why, man, we can't do it. We mean to sail miles up the river. Give up church for once, and do as I bid you, or your neigh- bors will profit by us instead of you." And the man at length consented, and he and his comrade gave up the evening service. And these were but' a few of the outward consequences which followed upon Bertha's drive that evening. A long train of evils was behind, but none of them came to her knowl- edge until years after, when, returning to the neighborhood, she was summoned to the sick- bed of Will Forester, now a husband and a father. How far, and how extensively the evil influence had spread she could never   FOR QUIET HOURS O     265 know. The stone which we cast at random in the water forms a tiny circle round itself, but it gives birth to ever-widening circles, which know no limit but the element -itsAef, Philosophers tell us that every so:d we create, every word we utter, sends forth a. vibratory motion, which is communicated to every portion of the atmosphere; and in like manner, though we hear it not, the sentiment we uttered ten years ago may be re-echoing now  in some far portion of the universe. If even  this thought strikes us as something solemn and, important, how much more thrill- ing is the consideration, that each one of us, in every word and action of our lives, is exer- cising an unseen and unceasing influence over the minds around him!  That which seems to us of no moment, an opinion, perhaps, lightly uttered, may be just the turning-point in the history of an immortal soul. "No man liveth to himself."  Look, reader, into your own experience ; retrace, if you can, the gradual forming of your opinions, your 12   266     QUIFT THOUGHTS habits, your mode of life; and you will find how much you have been guided, unwittingly perhaps, and almost imperceptibly, by the opinions and example of those around you. Just in the same proportion are you now aid- ing to form the characters of others. Every ' action you have done to-day, every word you have uttered, may have either forwarded or hindered an immortal soul in its pathway to eternity. God has so inwoven the interests of the human race, that they must act upon one another whether they will or no. Jelloshaphat little thought when he arranged to pay that visit to Ahab, and was so courte- ously received and feasted by him, what the fearful consequences of that excursion would be: the marriage of his son with the impious daughter of Ahab, the miserable career of that son in consequence, and the destruction of nearly his whole family, by the woman whom he had thus been the means of introducing into his family. The compassionate German lady who called-   ro QUIET HOURS. .267 into her house, and kindly cherished, the poor famishing little student who was leaning wist- fully against the porch of her door, little thought that she was helping, by that simple act, to rear up one of the most glorious pillars in the Church of Christ, or that he would live to record, through the length and breadth of Christendom, , that this act of kindness had disposed his soul to that confidence in God, which the severest trials could not afterwards shake." * Mr. Simeon, of Cambridge, perhaps did not know  at the time that his casual remark upon the subject of missions had fallen like seed-  corn  upon the heart of that young apostle Henry Martyn; and that long after he should be gathered to his fathers, a glorious harvest would be reaped in India and Persia, resulting from  the labors of that young martyr, who not only proclaimed the truth, but rendered the New Testament into the vernacular tongue of both those countries.
