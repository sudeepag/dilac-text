INTRODUCTION, WHCH THE READER IS PARTICULARLY REQUESTED TO LOOK AT, MOST people will call this book a bold one, and many will style it a decidedly dangerous one. To the first charge we are proud to plead guilty. But to the second accusation against our book, we object altogether. One word on this latter point. If it be dangerous to believe and to teach that a woman may, under peculiar circumstances, err, yet nsot be utterly lost; may still repent and still atone : If it be dangerous to believe and to teach that many a woman who has " erred," may yet be more truly noble in the sight of Heaven than many a woman who has not, but who is stained with irreligion, hypocrisy and other vices: If it be dangerous to believe and to teach that error in ab man is as great as precisely the same error in a woman;; If it be dangerous to believe and teach that the betrayal of a woman is murder, and should be punished as such: And, lastly, if it be dangerous to believe and to teach two things :- First, that what is called " society " is directly responsible for what is called "immorality." Second, that immorality is by no means the only evil having a social existence.   8         ERRING, YET NOBLE. If it be dangerous to believe and to teach, these things, then is the author of this book a very great sinner; then is his book a very dangerous and immoral production. But if these things are true, and if it be right occasionally for a good purpose to speak the truth plainly, then is our book a very good and useful one. Reader, we leave the question of the moral or immoral quality of our book to your own enlightened reason and honest conscience.   BOOK T H        FI ST. ERROR,. LOVE AND EXPIATION. C- CAPTER I. TWO LOVERS; OR, A JOY THAT IS SORROW. PARIS, gay, glad, great, gorgeous Paris; capital city of that most capital land, France, la belle France; land of the grape and of the jest; city of the ball and the barricade; city, where life is a pastime, and where the only reality is death; city, where the palace and the theatre usurp the place of the school and of the temple; Paris, dear, delightful, dangerous Paris I our story opens within thy festive limits, "Dearest, I love you. You know that I love you." Such were the words uttered by the lips of Henry Hericot, the gayest young American in Paris, to Julia Witherson. "But, Henry; are you sure that you know what love is? I. am told that love nieans so much more to a woman than it does to a man. To your sex it is but .a pastime, perhaps a beautiful romance. But to us it is more than a jest, more than a charm- ing poem even; it is to us life itself, the all of life worth-having. It is our sex's dream at first, its existence at last. Are you sure then that you know what r'eal love is?' "Ah, dearest, I think I do; but if I should be mistaken, if I should not - know, your own sweet self can be my teacher. You will find me an apt scholar at the passion." "But love is more than a passion ; it is a principle: a princi- ple which o'erpasses all others. You know, Henry, that I care little for the world, infinitely less than I care for the man I love." "Yes, Julia, I know that you, like myself, have little heed for the vulgar herd, and still less for the gilded shams and follies which the vulgar herd dignify by the names of laws. You have    10         EBBING, YET NOBLE. detected, I have taught you to detect, the hollowness of the world's forms, the mockeries of its social and religious con- ventionalities. I have taught you wisdom, and you have read- ily -become wise. You have learned with me and by me to laugh at society's ' virtue,' to despise society's ' religion.' Is it not so? Are not you and I above all creeds, all codes?" (Such were the words of Henry Hericot. His thoughts were these. "What cursed humbug all this is. But she likes this sort of thing. This style of 'independent cant is just in her line. And of course you must humor a woman if you would have her." So the deceiver thinks; and thus the deceived one replies to his question, "Are not you and I above all creeds, all codes?)") "Yes, Henry, for the man I love I would break all laws, all codes, and spurn all creeds; all, save only the laws of genuine honor and the creed -of nature. All else I would regard as less than nothing when weighed with the slightest wish or the most trivial good of him I loved. Could you, for my sake, Henry, spurn the world thus? Do you love me more than you do the- world?" "Aye, dearest, for you are all the world to me:"  O I if his words were but as true as his looks are tender I "And would you love me ever and forever 9" asks the girl, of him she deems her lover. "Yes, Julia," he replies, " for we, wiser than others, will not be fettered by these common everyday ties of law and society, which crush instead of keeping love.  We will have no obliga- tions in our union save those of mutual love and honor, but no restraint. Is it not thus, Julia?" "It is. But will you love me truly, love me always, Htarry? Will you love me in my time of sickness, in my hour of sorrow, when my poor beauty fades, and when I am no longer young?" "Yes, Julia; I swear ever to be to you all that man can be to woman.' "Will you love me," continued the misguided, miserable girl, who thought herself so wise and happy; "will you love me for *     ERRING, YET NOBLE.          1 love's sake through life to death? Love me .truly, me always, me only?" "Yes, dearest. Why ask me more questions?   Why go through the whole of love's catechism?  Were you to in. terrogate me until midnight, I could only answer, 'yes, dear- est.'  "Then, Henry, I am yours." "And I thine, Julia, my Julia." Unhappy pair I Wherefore unhappy? .Is not love bliss? And are they not lovers? Nevertheless, again we say " unhappy pair!" For love is not bliss unless it be sanctified and pure. And that is not love where there is error on one side and deception on the other. Let us be more definite. Julia Witherson, is that tall, queenly, intellectual looking girl, with a form superbly luxuriant in its outlines, yet most graceful in every curve; with a fine, thoughtful forehead; -dark, long luxuriant hair; large, dark, rather deep-set, and, if we may use the term, wildly-powerful eyes, surrounded by well-defined eye- brows; a fine though rather pale complexion; thin but not sharp  lips; evidently proud, courageous, passionate, deter- mined ; yet at the present moment all tender and loving; with her exquisite hands clasped in those of her companion, and the tip of her charming foot just visible outside the folds of her magnificent dress. She was, by birth, a :New Yorker, but her father and mother, shortly after her birth, took up their abode permanently in Paris.  When Julia was six years of age her mother died, and her father being a gay, dissipated man, the motherless child received literally no moral or religious education whatever. She was of a  gay disposition, though at the same time  fond of thought and prone to original, out of the way studies; and was gifted with much talent, independence of mind and powers of observation. Take a character like this, and let it loose, without restraint, to mature itself in philosophi-   12         ERRING, YET NOBLE. cal, infidel and immoral Paris, and the result will be--a woman like Julia Witherson at the age of eighteen. She had. many virtues. She had pride, which is a virtue to a certain extent; she had courage, loth physical and mental; independence also, which t hougli much decried in certain quarters, is a good thing to possess; she was generous to a fault, incapable of meanness in ally of its thousand forms; she was truthful, according to her views of truth, and would have scorned a lie as much as cowardice; but alas!" the trail of the serpent was over all" her noble qualities. The modern French views of social philo- soplhy had taken by imperceptible steps during the course of years a hold upon her naturally pure mind. And as she had plenty of brilliantly bad examples arounld her, and no Bible, her principles were sapped, and her only creed was that of a vague "honor," and a poetical but unpractical 'nlatulal religion.'" Yet this much must be said--she was honest .and sincere even in her errors and her unbelief; and withal candid. About a year before our opening, Miss Witherson   had become acquainted with Mr. Henry Hericot. And it speaks well for her that she was for one wlhole year able to resist the fascinations of this most accomplished hypocrite and ladykil- ler. But he succeeded at last. Is it any wonder that, thorough man of the world as he was, he succeeded in conquering the naturally virtuous instincts of Julia Withersoi, whose Parisian life and education had prepared the way for jlis triumph? .He laid siege to her in the most skillful manner. He commenced operations by taking an interest in her "studies," leading her to converse upon her opinions on religion and society, coinciding with their philosophical looseness ; and becoming her tutor on these points, led her from bad to worse, from mere theoretical unorthodoxy  to practical illmolrality. Then he fascinated her, too.  He employed his personal charms; pretended to poetry, and  to melody; was ardent, yet respectful, seemed the very paragon of manly nobility, courted her assiduously, and at last the motherless Julia, who lived, as it were, alone in Paris, with Paris education, Paris creeds, and Paris habits,       ERRING, YET NOBLE.          13 learned to love him  andj most ill-advised of all, to trust him. 8    8    *    5    e    8    ^ An hour passed, and over the luxuriously furnished apartment in which the lovers (so we will style them) were seated, the shadows of the twilight fell. The furniture was of the utmost elegance and of the latest fashion, every appointment was coimme il faut;. choice pictures adorned the walls, articles of vertu and bijouterie were scattered in liberal profusion ; every- thing material betokened wealth, and all that was human seemed to indicate happiness. For, in that sumptuous room, through the windows of which the last rays of departing day- light penetrated, there were but two beings, and they were clasped, lip to lip, heart to heart. Hericott's arm was round tlhe exquisite waist of Julia, and in her willing ears he poured the sweet filatteries of succeessful love. "But, Harry, dear Harry." Heavens, with what an accent she uttered that simple, short, common, delicious word " dear!" "will you indeed be all that you have promised to me?" "Can you doubt me, Julia?" asked Hericot. "No, dearest, for to doubt, doubt with cause, were to j  destroy my love for you, and to change it to hate.  I should die if I were to hate you, dearest." h' Ch, in tlat case you shall never die. You will live and love forever." There was silence for a space.  Then Julia said, "Harry, I often think of the beautiful creed which you have taught me-- that love is in itself a virtue and a religion. That it needs no cold forms, no useless laws, no legal rights, no detestable, worldly conventionalities to consecrate it; these but mar its h obliness ; love is its own consecration.' "You are rioht, Julia.  You have expressed my creed far more charmingly than I can do." "Yes," cried the erring enthusiast, raising; her charming head, her eyes sparkling, "love needs no laws, as God needs none; for even that strange old book, which Christians call the Bible, tells   "        ERRING, YET NOBLE. un that love is a god, for one text in it, which I now remember, says that ' God is love.'  "Julia, my Julia." Night.-The lovers have separated. "Oh, how happy I am," thinks Julia, as she sits in her room preparing, or being prepared, for the evening's entertainment, Madame S----'s soiree. 'Ie loves me. The loved can afford to be lappy. They have called me gay. I shall henceforth strive- to merit the title. For he loves me." "Well, I have succeeded," is the mental soliloquy of Henry ]Ericot, as he departs. "I knew that I should. No woman has ever resisted me yet. Julia is a strange creature, but no matter.   Vive 'amour!" d And he hums the favorite aria from the last opera. Unhappy pair I Unhappy she who errs I Thrice unhappy he who tempts to err I There is a guilty joy that is but a sorrow.   ERRINGS YET NOBLE.          15 CHAPTER II. TWO FOES: OR, A OR RROW THAT 'IS A JOY. A YEAR has passed since the date of the love scene in our last. It is night-and stormy. Paris is as gay a city as any in the world; and yet, even Paris is not very cheerful in the rain. The French are a happy people, and yet the weather does affect even Parisians slightly. , The clouds are threatening-the sky is'invisible--not a star is to be seen, and the streets are comparatively deserted. Julia Witherson is seated alone in the same elegant apartment in which we last saw her. The room has not changed any, but its occupant has. A glance at- her face shows you that she is far from happy. The marks of care and thought are perceptible--unless we are much mistaken, she has of late been weeping; spite her pride we can detect, even at this moment, traces of sorrowful emotion. Her robes are rich and tasteful.   She is dressed now, as ever, elegantly. She is surrounded with luxury, yet she is most unhappy. No won- der. She has been aroused from her mental sleep--she has b awakened from  her dream of false love and real error-she is not the woman she was twelve months ago. "I love still," she murmurs-; "but, alas, I also doubt- doubt him and myself.  I have learned my fatal error. Experi- ence has taught me that my social philosophy is a     mis- take. After all the mass of the world is right in its views of love, of virtue, of marriage; and the school of philosophy, where he led and I have fondly followed, is, on these points, in the wrong. I honestly deemed it right once, I know it to be false now. My instincts tell me this, I can never be happy or selfjustified till I am  Henry's wife. But will he grant my prayer?  Will he marry me? Is he sincere in his anti-marriage   16         ERRING, YET NOBLE. theory? If so, will 'he relinquish it for me? Ah I I fear he does not love me as he did-still I may wrong him in this-well, I shall-soon see. Why does he not come?" She sighs, and leans her cheek upon her hand, in utter %veari- ness of spirit ;' and, as she listens to the dreary falling of the raili, a sigh escapes her which has a world of meaning in it. And there and thus she sits and thinks and waits and gazes un- heeding upon the luxury around her, till a step is heard-a well-known step. A man enters the apartment. It is the man she awaits, Henry Hericot, her once adorer. She looks at him intently. He is worthy to be looked at, this lover of hers. Henry Hericot is one of the handsomest men of his day. Even the hideous mockery of modern, civilized, nineteenth-cen- tury " dress" can not destroy the grace of his figure. He is of averaage height, and capitally proportioned ; a thorough man, in physique, certainly, His face seems to be-m-uark this word seems-the very index of a frank, honorable character, is very handsome and of an intellectual cast, also, as indicated by the high forehead. His eyes, dark but not black, are winning; his mouth as beautiful as a woman's, yet there is nothing effeminate about his appearance; his hair, of the same hue as his eyes, is luxuriant for a man, and is a cause of just pride to its possessor, who is as well aware of his personal advantages as any beholder possibly can be, which is evident from the elegant manner in which his person is arrayed. Every detail of his cos tume is perfect; fashionable, yet not frivolous; costly, yet not dandyish; in short, looking at him, you forget the dress in the wearer, which is the true secret of attire I He walks with grace, he is a thorough man of the world, accustomed to please men and charm women. And one woman is evidently, at this moment, charmed with him. Julia, as he enters, gazes at him fondly, her troubles, her fears forgot, in the love which she still bears to him. "Henry,"' she cries, springing into his extended arms, -Y"I knew that you would come to-night."   P              ERBRIS YET NOBLE.        17 "Why, ma belle, you do not suppose I would defer an ap- pointment with you on account of such a trifle as the state of the weather? Ah, I love you better than you imagine." "Ah, I have a request to make to-night that will try that love of yours, Harry," rejoins Julia. "Ask what you will," replies Hericot ; " ask anything that love should ask, and love will grant it. But first tell me how you have been this last week? Just to think-I have been absent from Paris and you, a whole week : in fact I would have been away even longer had you not insisted so particularly, in your last letter, that you must see me at once." "Yes, Harry, I do wish to see you, and to ask you to- to-- - "But, dearest, first answer my question before you ask me another," interrupts Hericot, who, to tell the truth, does not seem anxious to allow Julia to come to her point at once. Perhaps he has an idea of what she wishes and seeks for a de- lay. "How have you been the last week?  What have you been doing, darling?9'- "Thinking of you, and of myself,"- replies Julia. "Ah, darling, which of your two subjects of thought occupied the greater portion of your time, myself or yourself?" "Harry, you know that, to my mind at. least, these two subjects, as you call them, are but one. We love each other, do we not?" "-Of course we do, IMa chore amip give me a kiss and make no more such foolish inquiries." "Well then, Harry, there can not be two of us." "So then, I am to understand that you have thought of me all the week." "Yes, Harry." "And strange to say, I have been all the week dreaming of you, Julia." "Have you really, really now, truant. I had feared you might have forgotten me. Do not chide me for being silly, but you do love me as much as ever, do you not?"   18        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "More, darling Julia, more, mulch more than ever." The tone is fervent, is the heart so? !"Oh, how happy you have made me by those simple words. Then I am no longer afraid to ask you to-to--" "But," again interrupts Hericot, who seems most desirous in vulgar but expressive parlance, to " dodge" the request that Julia has thus twice been on the verge of uttering, " how pale you look to-night; and you have been crying, too. Silly dar- ling-silly darling. Come, I must cheer you. You have called me, at different times, your 'admirable Chricton.' You say I sing well, play the piano skilfully, dance elegantly, talk elo- quently, do all things well, in short ; this is your style of flattery, is it not?" "Nay, Harry, it is not flattery, but truth." And, reader, truth it was. Hericot was not only one of tho most elegant, but one of the most accomplished of men. Every social skill was his. All the arts of music, dancing, languages, etc., were his to a high degree of perfection ; and he used them as one great means to social and especially to feminine success. But to return. "Well," rejoined Hericot, "whether truth or flattery, one thing is certain, I am accomplished enough to drive away your melancholy, and I shall proceed to do so without further de- lay." So saying, he advanced to the piano close by, a choice Erard, and opening it, performed a magnificent aria, followed by ja de- licious waltz-one of Strauss' best. In vain did Julia protest that she was not melancholy ; in vain did she request her lover to be serious and to listen. Hericot seemed to be possessed with the very demon of " light music," and rattled off melody after melody. At last Julia, who was passionately addicted to har- mony, forgot for the moment the weight upon her h6art-even the demand she had to make-and lent herself to the influence of the music. She looked at her handsome lover; she listened to the witching strains which he evoked. What to her was the rain without? What was even the tumult of her soul?   ERRING, YET NOBLE.          19 Love and music! Twin divinities, their charms were irresisti- ble. She stood, in the pride of her swelling figure, with a bright light in her large, dark, deep-set eyes, and a passingo flush upon her intellectual yet passionate countenance, while her lover with his elegant form bended gracefully over the instrument, occasionally looking at his companion with his winning and  seemingly honest and loving eyes.  Around was Splendor I Without wa8 Storm, but within was Melody and Love I But the excitement of the moment passed-reason and duty returned. And Julia at length found or rathler made an oppor- tunity to utter her request-the request of her life. She de- manded of her lover- marriage. He pretended surprise, but in reality he was not at all aston- ished. He had observed the change in Julia for some time past. He had expected just such a request as this to-day, and had en- deavored, as we halve seen, to defer-it. But Julia Witherson would not be put off. She told him in eloquent because heartfelt language her whole heart history. How she had been left motherless, and been cast upon the world of Paris guideless ; how she had seen all around hler false " reli- gion" and spurious " morality" and open yet elegant " vice;" how she had been forced to witness many miserable marriages ; how, when disappointed with the world, the specious reasonings of French and German infidel philosophers had charmed her till they had at last unsexed her ; how lie (Hericot) had confirmed her in these dangerous views, and had by his, teachings made her what she was ; how she had been honest even in her false views. But she also tells hiim how during the last year she has had her eyes opened. How she now sees the fatal error of their mutual creed ; how she now believes in natural, if not revealed, religion, and has faith in the sanctity and value of marriage. She als tells her impatient listener (whose face is far from looking as smiling orJas noble as it seemed a moment since.) how she now regards their mutual relations; in short, she pleads for mar- riage--"By your love, your honor, your sense, my claims, by   s0         ERRING, YET NOBLE. our common hopes, I implore you to grant me this boon-to call me from henceforward by the holy name of wife!!" So cried Julia while Hericot replied, in his blandest tones, "Ma belle amifdo you know that you are talking nonsense." Then Julia began a yet more vehement appeal, and solemnly demanded a solemn answer. Then thus spake Hericot: "Well, Ma belle, if you will have me answer you, I love you as much as ever, more than ever, but I cannot marry you, indeed I cannot." "' Will not, you mean," said Julia, with flashing eyes. "Now, macher6 amiedo not put words into my mouth that I do not utter," was the cool reply (apropos, men always take matters of this kind very coolly). "I am not rich, and am a spendthrift; you are not really rich, thoughl deucedly extrava- gant; therefore, pecuniary reasons forbid. our marriage. Be- sides, I think of matrimony as you oqzce did. I abhor its con- straints. They are death to love."  Hericot had other reasons for refusal, but these lie did NOT mention. Julia answered all the objections which he did mention, one by one. She pressed him hard, till at last, vexed by her persist- ence, thinking by a bold stroke to end the matter finally, Henry Hericot does a thing which he is very seldom in the habit of doing, he "shows his band," in other words, gives to Julia her first and  true idea of his real character. He mocks at her repentance, he jests at her new-found virtue, he tells her he has wearied of her, he refuses once for all to marry her. It is all over. The revelation which comes sooner or later to every woman who loves '" not wisely but too well," the revela- tion that the too successful lover no longer loves, that he who betrays will not atone, has  come at last to Julia. The scales have fallen from her eyes. She sees him, herself, her past, present and future in their true light of scorn, shame and sorrow. But he shall not see her woe. Rising with all the majesty and awful beauty of an injured queen, with proud face, swelling figure and flashing eyes, she points to the door of the magnifi- f     ERRING, YET NOBLE.         21 cent apartment. "Go,"she thunders, "and depart from me forever. Man, I loathe you ; false lover, I hate you ; betrayer, I curse you. May you never more know happiness or peace. Again I curse you. May'your death be as terrible as you have made my life. Go." And like a whipped hound, cowed by the awful dignity of his injured victim, the dashing, handsome Henry Hericot, loolk- ins unutterably mean, crawls, as it were, rather than walks out of the splendid room, out of the hall, out into the rainy night and the dark streets of Paris. Akn hour passes and Henry Hericot is seen at the opera bril- liantly attired and gay, very gay. He returns to his rooms at a late hour, humming the brindisi he has just heard.  He reaches his lodgings, dismisses his servant kindly (strange to say, he is always very kind to his menials), and is left alone in his chamber. "I could almost be tempted to believe in that foolish Bible," so runs his mental soliloquy, " or to imagine that after all there is a God, or to put faith in atailor, or do any other wild thing, after Julia's strange conduct to-nigrht. She certainly cannot be in earnest--impossible. She was only '"Lshamming" to gain her point. I don't exactly understand that girl; but no matter. Damn it I I am tired of her. What did she ever love me for? I am sure I never loved her-not I. Shei is a fine, queer, ro- mantic woman, with peculiar notions, which I have taken advan- tage of; but the idea of marrying her is absurd, perfectly so. Besides, I begin to find myself quite attracted by that charming Madame B   . I wish I had only been more bold to-night with Julia. I wonder if I am a coward. A boy told me so once; well, I shall not let the world know I am one at any rate.  Now to bed." And Henry Hericot slept as peacefully as though he had not sinned and murdered : sinned a 'damning sin and murdered a woman I I F-r  had he not really murdered Julia Witherson? a       a        ,f  a     22         ERRING, YET NOBLE. And what of her? When the door closed upon the hand- some face and form of her once lover; when the sound of his voice was hushed int6 silence ; then, when there was nothing save the lamp-light within the room and the dreary rain over- head; then, in uncontrolable agony Julia bowed her haughty head and burst into tears, scalding tears, which came from the depths of a deceived heart. Then she wildly raised her large eyes upwards, and exclaimed in spirit, like the holy one of old, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Her errors are now producing their fruit. This is the first installment of her expiation. The rain rains on, the night drags on, the wind whistles, the sky continues starless, and still sits Julia, brooding over the embers of a deceived love and a destroyed hope. But there is a sorrow which is a joy. There is joy in Heaven over one sinner that rcpenteth.   CHAPTER      III. SECOND LOVE. NIGHT upon the ocean. And a noble steamer is cleaving the waters, on its way from the old world to the new. On the deck of the vessel stands Julia Witherson. contemplating suicide by drowning. A  year has passed since we last saw her. Her. father has died and been buried in a foreign land, and she is now desolate in the sight of the world, and disgraced in her own eyes. Why should she live? One plunge and all is over. But the fit of temporary madness passes away ; she has something to live for yet-Repentance and Atonement. For unlike the majori- ty of her class, she believes that Atonenent and Repentance even for such as her are still possible. She retires below, thinks and dreams disturbcdly, and at last sleeps. *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * By the will of the late Mr. Witherson, his daughter was en- trusted to the care of a Mr. Russel; his brother-in-law, a resi- dent of New York. Mrs. Russel, Julia's aunt, was glad to receive her niece into her family, and made our orphan heroine soon feel herself comparatively at home. Julia 'had of late greatly changed. She was no longer the gay, social butterfly, but a woman, dignified and reserved. Her only joys were her studies, which were of a very peculiar nature. Though she was what is technically styled "accomplished" and "literary," "yet her mental bias inclined her toward abstruse and uncommon fields of intellectual labor ; and thus in the "wild" and "extra- ordinary" she was enabled occasionally to forget the woes of the "ordinary" and the " practical." She kept herself aloof from the world, read, studied and sighed. *   * *e          * *   *c    24         ERRING, YEPT NOBLE. We must now record one exception to Miss Witherson's gen, eral rule of social reserve. Mrs. B., of the Fifth Avenue, an intimate of the- lussels, gave one night a grand party, and Julia, at the earnest request of her relatives, consented to attend. Now we might here with propriety descant upon the Avenue and its attractions, upon society and its shams, upon parties and their follies; but we forbear. We are no Thackeray (would that we were), and so we pass on. We might be. very satirical upon the charms of brown-stone mansions, the snobbery of fashion, its godlessness and heart- lessness, its mockeries of feeling, its polished deceptions, its carelessness of character, its worship of wealth, its mingled ex- travagance and meanness, its lies and slanders, its dandies and fcreign counts 'of no account, its noisy chatterers and half-naked belles ; but we will have mercy on our readers. Julia looks very lovely, or rather very distingue. She is attired fashionably, richly, almost extravagantly, yet very plain- ly, tastefully and (what is very rare) chastely. No " low nIecks," no "lshort sleeves," no attempts at'seeming nalced without exactly beig so; her dress is high in the neck, ad ansers for a cover- i'ig as well aS an adornment. Yet she cannot disguise the glo- rious beauty of her form; she cannot conceal the intellectual beauty of her face ; she cannot hide the charms of her luxuriant hair and her magnificent eyes ; she is, as it were, in her own despite charming.  She does not converse much ; her looks attract, but her reserve repels. She seems like one who has no interest in the social farce around her. She would far rather Ibe alone with lher books. Even now she i; comparatively alone with her thouglits. Alas I She feels that she herself, like those around her, acts a part. Did the world with which she mingles but know her history, the fatal story of the last few years, it would cast her like a polluted thing from its embrace. But enough of this. Her uncle approaches her, and with lhimn comes a young gentleman whom Mr. Russel introduces to hs niece as Mr. Charles Singerly. No chance is given her to avoid the in-   troduction, even haltl she been desirous of so doing. -She is fairly laken by sto'l'm. She I had heard of Mr. ChII:rlbs Singefly. She had read some of his writing-'s, f)o he was an author of con- siderable note. She remembered 1her unclels having describe(d him as "a most handsome fellow," and as " a man of the highest social status and persoinal 'character." And old Mr. RIssel was right. Siingcrly is " handsome." His style of form and feature is remarkably classic, and decidedly intellectual. There is soa I i His beauty ; it is not the mere combination  of physicl elements, as in the case of Henry liericot, but the physical seems to be the fitting exponent of the mental part. He is of moderate height and   elegantly formed, with a large and most expressive dark eye, an exquisite month, a small and, a musical voice, and is elegantly attired.  Tho olly remarkable feature of his dress is the amount of valuable jewelery he carries about himl in the shilpe of watch; rings, breastpin, chllais, etc. Fondness for jewelry has always been a passion with him, one of his few weaknesses. . Still there is nothing in the least "flashy" about him. Every detail of his costume is characterized by exquisite taste. He in his description of young Singerly's social status and personal character. Well born, inheriting a. large property from his father, gay like all of his class, yet honorable and with education and talents of a high order, Mr. Singlerly had already won a literary reputation, and had evinced mental powers and an originality of thought which prophesied for him a brilliant future. He had seen Julia  to-night at Mrs. B--'s   entertain- ment for the first time, and  had been  instantly attracted both by her magnificent figure and her intellectual countenance And Miss Witherson, in the course of the conversation which comes between herself and her new acquaintance, learns to ad- mire him and to appreciate the fact that he differs in many respects most materially from: the average specimens of the genus "young men" which infest modern " society." They discuss together poetry and various intellectual subjects,   26.        ERRING, YET NOBLE. and, Singerly details for his hearer's mingled amusement and edification a scheme of his for the training of poets, "rendering them self-supporting," as he phrases it (by the by a most capital scheme, if it could only be carried out). "Why do you not realize your idea?" asks Miss Witherson of her companion. "Ah, I have one great vice, Miss Witherson. I am very indolent. I sincerely hate work." Singersy spoke laughingly; but he spoke truth. He was very lazy--he did hate exertion. And he was not only indolent but careless, especially in pecuniary matters. "4 I should be sorry to believe even your own evidence against yourself, sir," replies Julia. As she speaks she raises her eyes and starts violently. ;Before her stands among the crowd a man whom she knows well, too well, Henry Hericot himself, whom she has not seen since the memorable night of their parting in Paris. Hericot bows to Chariles Singerly, with whom he is very intimate, and, after a momentary hesitation, bows also to Julia. She is strongly agitated, lout has learned self-control ; it comes to her aid now.  She acknowledges the salute with reserve, and Hericot, after a moment's reflection, and a laugh. ing jest with Mr. Singerly, disappears among the dancers. Julia feels as though she was stifling, but people must restrain themselves in fashionable society; and she soon recovers her self-possession, externally at least. "You know my friend Hericot, then, Miss Witherson?" says Singerly. "We have met," replies Miss Witherson, simply. Good God I they had met indeed I At this moment a gentleman passes our couple, with a young lady leaning upon his arm. Both Julia and Mr. Singer!y bow to the lady, addressing her as Miss Somers. "You know  Miss Somers, then?" asks Singerly of Miss Witherson. -"Yes," is the reply, ' we have been comparatively intimate for some time." r  s   .   ERRING, YET NOBLE.          27 It often happens that circumstances in society lead to a sort of intimacy between parties wholly unsuited to each other. So it is -in the case of Miss Somers and Miss Witherson. Two persons more utterly unlike in their real natures it would be im- possible to meet. With all her errors and her sins, Julia is noble; with all her orthodoxy, etiquette, and morality, Katherine Somers is not. Yet -did the world know what we do of Miss Witherson, we fear that it would still adore the technically stainless and hypocritical Kate, while it visited with its heaviest scorn the technically stained but truly re- pentant Julia I Such. is life I Katherine Somers is a -blonde, cold-seeming, cold-hearted, rather tall, rather slender, with pale skin, light eyes and thin lips; on the whole rather pretty. Her hair slightly auburn, falls in long ringlets, and her form is gracefillly shaped ; her arms, hands and feet are specially fine, consequently you will observe that her every attitude is so studied as to display the beauties of. these members. She professes to be moral, most moral, modest, most modest; yet you perceive that her dress is fully as low in the neck and as short in the sleeves as any decent woroan's dress ought to be-in fact, we think that a little less of the bust might have been displayed and modesty have been none the sufferer. And to-night, at Mrs. B   's party, Miss Kate Somers, with her cold eyes, artificial smile and complexion, with her arsenic, rouge belladonna, etc., etc., and her fashionably im. modest dress (which Miss Witherson would not wear for worlds), flirts, discourser gossip, lies and slander, and in her secret heart curses this night when Julia has made the acquaint- ance of Mr. Charles Singerly. For this gentleman has long, been an object of Miss Somers' special regard. Is he not fash- ionable and rich? An excellent parti? And what right has Miss Witherson to interfere with the matrimonial speculations of her friend? What right, truly? Yet Miss Katherine is a pious, moral, virtuous lady of fashion, who would be of course in the eyes of the world,   28         E RRING, YET NOBLE. (mind, we say of the world, dear reader,) infinitely the superior of Julia. We wonder if God sees things in the same light in which the world sees them? And meanwhile Mr. Singerly (who is of a most excellent family, whose merchant-father left him three years ago the sole possessor of nearly " half-a million," with but a mother to sup- port-who has received a capital collegiate education, who has travelled abroad, who has published a volume of very good and very successful poetry, and who is a noble fellow, though the young ladies call him I' a little wild," and the young 'men style him " decidedly fast "), Mr. Charles Singerly, for whom Miss Somers, and all the women of his " set," have sighed in vain (and not in secret, either), is experiencing the first touches of a 1" tender passion." Julia has charmed him more than any other woman whom lie has ever met; and the results of this their first meeting will be fully known only in the future. Does he imagine what she really is? Does he dream of the awful secret which shrouds her soul with horror? We tr7ow nou;. Ah 1 it is well for us poor mortals that sometimes "we see through a glass darkly." *-   *    *   *   *   *    * A few days subsequent to Mrs. B   's entertainment, Mr. Charles Singerly, during his morning's promenade down Broad- way, encountered Miss Witherson, who was taking her custom- ary walk for exercise. He joined her, and prevailed upon her to visit with him an art-gallery. . In an hour or so they parted, mutually pleased. Spite her reserve, Julia could not help mak- ing a distinction in favor of Singerly. Suddenly, Charles dis- covered that Mfr. Russell was a person worth knowing intimately; and, before long, our hero established himself as a visitor at his residence. Here, he learned one new attraction that our heroine possessed. She was a magnificent musician, alike upon the harp and the piano, both vocal and instrumental. Music to her was more than an accomplishment, it was a solace from sorrow, a relief from study, a religion. And between Julia's singing and Charles' poetical recitations the evenings   ERRoqN', YET NOBLE.         29 passed rapidly away. Mr. Singerly was the possessor also of a stylish pair of horses, and before long he persuaded Miss Witherson to accompany him in his equestrian excursions. In short, Julia and Charles became intimate, and at last Charles learned to love Julia. Charles Singerly had been in his time "successful," as it is called, ' with women ;" during his colle- giate career he had unguardedly accomplished the ruin of a beautiful young girl. To this last act, however, he looked back with sorrow, and his life for several years had been compara- tively " moral."  He was now  searching for a wife, and his great desiderata for a partner were not so much money or position as intellect, and, above all, a stainless character. For it always happens the more "wild" men have been themselves, by so much the more are they exacting in regard to the immacculate purity of the women they intend to marry. Now does it not seem,a strange fatality that of all the women on earth Charles Singerly should fall in love with Julia Witherson? What strange mistakes we men do make some- times I And yet, after all, this mistake of our hero's was not unac- countable. In the first place, he had no reason to doubt Julia. Her secret was never suspected. Secondly, every man in love imagines his beloved one all that can be desired. But, thirdly, and chiefly, Charles had every reason to believe in the character of Julia from her everyday conduct and conversation. Having erred and repented, Julia was more cautious of the appear. ance of evil than even a woman would be who had not erred at all. Thus, it came to pass that, though stained, she appeared stainless; thus it happened that Singerly imagined that of all the women of his acquaintance, the m6st virtuous was Julia Witherson. Charles loves Julia. And does she love him? This question we will now answer in detail. At her first meeting with him, our heroine was somewhat pleased, and by the attentions which he paid her subsequently she was both gratified and flattered.   80     -    ERRTNG  YET NOBLE. For Singerly was no common man, and even a proud, reserved, sternly-intellectual woman could afford to unbend herself in his society. As she saw more of Singerly she was forced to admire him the more. tIe had weaknesses it is true. He was indolent in most things, careless in many things, somewhat dissipated, by no means pious ; but he was industrious and ambitious in literary pursuits, was at the bottom a man of thought as well as feeling had no vulgar vices, had no meannesses whatever, and was pos- sessed of a high sense of honor. Superficially, he seemed a frivolous man -of the world ; really, at heart, he was a true man- as well as a thorough gentleman ; a being at once of sense, tal- ent, sentiment, and, withal, wit. Julia appreciated him at his real value, and often compared him, to his infinite favor, with her once idol, Henry Hericot. Still no thought of love or its possibility, as regarded Mr. Singerly, crossed our heroine's mind till it was casually suggested by a hasty remark of the envious Katherine. Having   once entered Julia's mind, the idea, like Banquo's ghost, would not down. True, she did not love him, she could never love again, etc., etc., love to her was an impossibility; but, at any rate, he might love her. This must be prevented, and so Julia would astonish Mr. Singerly by some sudden attack of dignity, reserve, and the like. But the fit was but- momentary, and, to tell the truth, Julia soon found that she could not be reserved towards Charles.  One day she heard that Mr. Gingerly had been taken suddenly ill, perhaps would die.  The shock she then received taught her a lesson. Disguise it as she might, she did love him, and love him truly. Chares recovered ; the sickness which had caused the revelation passed away, but the revelation itself remained. Strange, almost impossible, as Julia regarded the fact, yet fact it was, she loved for the second and last time; loved truly, wholly, purely, and forever. When she made this discovery of her love, her first determinae tion was to resist and to conquer it-a brave but impossible resolve I  "I am not worth his love," she cried--"I am not what he deems me.   I will crush his passion, for his sake as for   ERRING, YET NOBLE.-         31 Wine. He should love some better woman, whom he can marry. As for me, marry I dare not. We must part forever, without in explanation. Explanations were out of the question." But at another time, she would exclaim: "Why should I throw away my chance of happiness? If he loves me, why should I not wed him? I have erred but have repented, .and my future life will be as pure as- that of any woman. Nay, I am pure. Cannot my present and my future redeem the past?  As' he dreams not of my heart's error, what matters it? -Why should we both suffer? I will be to him the truest of wives? Yes, I will accept him, marry him, love him, forget the past, and, at last, be happy."  Thus at times would speak her natural pride and her yearning love.  And so "she halted between two opinions," and every day the mental struggle grew more intense. At last she resigned herself to the current of events, prepared to accept Charles whenever he should declare himself. Life to her now had acquired a new interest; thoug h' sometimes the black' memories of the past arose like spectres within her, yet her soul's energies were consecrated chiefly to the joys of the present and the anticipations of the future. Chane e now the time and scene. It is the middle of m- Change we now the time and scene. It is the middle of sum- mer, and Charles and Julia are at Long Branch together. It is moonlight. The heavens are blue and cloudless. The ocean seems like a sheet of restless silver ; its vast breast heaves gently underneath its load of libght ; its whitened waves murmur softly and continuously upon the shining beach. They do not roar, these moonlit waves, they only ripple.' Majestic Neptune seems to be appeased, and merely whiers as he kisses shore. Hundreds of gay and happy beings wCider rejoicing in the pass- ing beauty of the scene and night. , Here and there among the groups we find an aged couple, but the majority of strollers are young, delighting themselves in their youth. And amongst this latter class are Charles and Julia. They wander in a secluded portion of the beach. They talk in low tones, and their conversation is of poetry-that theme so   32         EBRRING YET NOBLE. near akin to love. At last, in their stroll, they arrive at an arbor, belonging to a cottage situated at a considerable distance from the beach. Into this arbor they enter and seat themselves. And still they talk--talk of the sea, and Byron and Barry Corn- wall, who have written of it, and of Moore, the poet of moonlit nights and of love. Then comes a silence, deep, delicious, and most dangerous-for in silence the heart speaks loudest. "Oh, they utter not a word- "4 But the beating of their own hearts "Is the only sound they heard." And in these intervals of stillness their beings unite in thought and spirit- "1 Two souls with but a single thought, "Two hearts that beat as one." At last the silence is broken-by whom? By Charles Sin- gerly-and by what?   By an abrupt but passionate declaration of love-a declaration long delayed by one party (delayed be- cause, though brave as any knight of any agre, lie dared not risk the all of his heart upon an uncertainty), and as long expected by the other. But now the barriers of timidity are broken, the restraints of months are burst, and in most eloquent words, ut- tered in most musical tones, lie tells her of his worship. "Julia," he whispers, softly, yet, O God I how earnestly, "Julia, I love you. From the first hour I met you, you took possession of my heart. I have fanlcied other women before now, but I never truly loved until you blessed my longing sight. You must have seen ere this that you are the only woman on this earth to me. My fate is in your hands. I lay myself at your feet. Have I dared to hope in vain? Oh, no ; it cannot be. You love me, do you not? For I adore you." And the moon shines in upon them, and the everlasting mur- mur of the sea sounds in their ears. But the light is unheeded, and naught care they for " what the wild waves are saying ;" for the star of love within the heaven of their hearts arises in dazzling glory, and the entrancing melodies of passion fill their   ERRING, YET NOBLE.          33 souls with harmony. The sea-breeze fans their faces, but they reck not of it; for the breath of affection is far sweeter than even the summer airs of ocean. And there in the arbor by the sea he tells her how he loves her. As he proceeds in his story he grows bolder; he winds his arm around her waist, and she ,does not chide him ; he takes her hand, and it is not withdrawn ; he implores her to answer him, and, without a word, she hides her face and her blushes upon his rapturous bosom. Thus he knows he is beloved. And as he clasps her in his embrace, and presses upon her lips the first kiss of love, he feels for the first time in his life what it is to be really happy. He blesses all things. He blesses the moon that beholds his joy, the stars that twinkle upon it, the sea that'murmurs around it; he blesses God--and her, his Julia. And she-how feels she?   She can hardly herself answer this question. She is happy assuredly ; for he is at last hers and she at last his. Hle, the admired, the talented, the handsome, the noble, desires no other joy than to be near her forever ; and her heart swells alike with gratified pride and -delighted love. For she does indeed love him, love   him  truly, devotedly; as 'passionately as (and far more purely than) she loved Hericot in the years gone by.  She admires, trusts, respects and loves him as a woman should the man she hopes one day to call her hus- band.  He is her all in all of life, and he is hers. Visions of future pleasures, dreams of a, coming marriage, wifehood, and true womanhood, rise thick and fast within her soul. She feels how exquisite a thing it is to be beloved. Around  them  the night seems to grow lovelier ; the air more balmy; the stars brighter; and the murmur of the sea more musical. She too is blessed. And yet even in his embrace, even with his kiss upon her lips, even with his passionate avowal still sounding in her ears, the phantom of distrust that has so long beset her, the phantom of memory of the past and of despair for the future, this old phan- tom of her shame and sorrow, will not wholly disappear.  The recollections of another love, and of, O God, a former error, glide   34    :     ERRGNI YET NOBLE. horribly through the hid chamhers of her soul to-night, even -to-night, the night of night, the night in which a noble man has told her that he loves her. But there is no skeleton with Charles Singerly. No phantom follows him. He loves and he is loved. And life is to him henceforth but a smile. He calls his Julia by every endearing epithet, he vows his whole existence to her service, he rhapso- dizes with the wild extravagance which seems natural to pas- sion. And then together, arm in arm, with many a tender glance at one another, they quit that sea-side arbor, forever consecrated in their memories, and 'walk along the moonlit beach, and return at last, though unwillingly, to common life and the "Hotel." Love, Love, Love I Wlhat is there in life like love! And yet, how transitory a thing it oftentimes is. A beautiful dream. Charles and Julia, be ye happy while ye may.   FERRING, YET NOBLE.         35 OHAPTER IV. "CONFESSION IS ATONE]IENT." CHARLES SINGERLY and Julia Witherson were now betrothed lovers. But their engagement was kept for a time secret, as Charles desired, like a fond son as he was,/ that his mother (who 9  was at present trCavelliug abroad) should be the first one to know of his happiness. But Mr. and Mrs. Russell suspected the truth, and were very giad of it (for Sirngerly was an ex. cellent parti), and old, Mr. Russell gave Charles a cordial invitation to spen-d some time with  him  at Fairview Cot- tage, his country seat on the Hudson.  Our hero cordially accepted. Behold him   now  domesticated at Fairview Cot. tage. The Hudson is the -most charming of rivers, and Fairview Cottage was one of the most charming, of country residences. It was surrounded with trees, one of which, a beautiful willow, close by the river, was an especial favorite, and was known as "the river tree." It is the second day of August, hot but lovely, and Julia is sitting under her favorite tree, alone, for a wonder, and think- ing. She is happy, yet unhappy. Blessed in her present love, yet cursed in the memory of her past, which would obtrude itself; cursed in the knowledge there is and ever must be a fear- ful secret between herself and her lover. Naturally noble, she is averse to the meanness of even an implied deception I And yet she had no alternative. So even in her love, she was not alto. gether blest. Memory, memory, what a curse thou ofttimes art! Awhile she sits beneath the river willow, thinking bitterly, and then, striving to escape heat and thought together, she betakes herself to a neighboring grove, and throwing herself upon a rustic but most comfortable couch, endeavors to sleep.   36        - ERRING, YET NOBLE. All around and above her invites to repose. Not a leaf of the surrounding trees seems stirring, there is no breeze; the very hum of the insects is drowsy; the songs of the birds are com- 'paratively hushed ; even the shadows are still; while the light clouds glide lazily along the calm heavens. It is an idle and an indolent time ; and Julia, thrown in languid abandonment upon the green earth, her sun-bonnet lying at her side, her magnifi- cent hair released from the confinement of the comb, closes her large, beautiful eyes in a delicious, semi-unconsciousness, banish- ing by her strong will all care. But just as she is sinking to slumber, she hears the sound of two voices, one of them lber lover's. The speakers pass the grove, but see her not, they are conversing so earnestly. Julia, from her retirement, is alike averse to interrupt them (as Charles's coimpanion is a stranger to her) or to listen. But she is compelled to do the latter; she cannot help it. Her lover and his friend discuss politics for a brief space. Then they dwell upon that most interesting of earthly subjects, the weather; then they treat of various other topics. At length Julia hears her own name mentioned by Charles' com- panion, who congratulates, our hero "on his success with Miiss Witherson." Of course Charles disclaims all success, etc., but his friend says "that he is not to be deceived, but is well con- vinced that, whether publicly acknowledged or not, a private and satisfactory understanding exists between Mr. S  and Miss W   ."  The conversation  then glides into various themes connected with marriage, love, women, and the like. And at last her lover eagerly argues with his companion on a subject on which men often argue, the purity of women. She hears him, say these words: "A woman has nothing unless she has character. All other gifts of head and heart are worth nothing.  Think, mv friend," her lover 'cries to his companion, "what were our feelings were our sisters stained I Think what were our feelings were the women whom we love dishonored 1 Think what were our emotions should we ever be husbands-to light women. It is chiefly because we know a womnan to be pure that we   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         37 adore her; and should she cease to be so, we would cease to be her adorers."' Here the words grew fainter; the reply of Charles' companion ceased to be audible, the two gentlemen passed ol, and Julia was left in silence-but not to sleep, not to finish her nap. 01i, my God, no I Was it chance or the will of Heaven that had led Charles to speak such words as these ill her hearing? Her emotions as she remained there in that beautiful grove were horrible. Yet, what could she do? Should she break lIer betrothal engage- ment with Singcrly? Alas! they so loved each other! She must continue as she had begun. And then pride arose within ,her. She had repented, she would atone, she was now pure. It was best that he should remain forever in his blissful ignor- alnce of her past. Her future would be all that lie could crave. Pride conquered, and this noble, truthful girl must still bear her shame in secret, indirectly deceive her lover, and be adored by lhil under false pretences. She arose, and leaving the grove in its noontide beauty, returned to the house. Julia endeavored to forget the words of her lover and the emotions which they had caused, but in vain. And Providence so ordered it that the subject was brought forcibly again to her mind the very next day, in a new and unexpected manner.  Her lover going out for a ride, in which, on account of the heat, she had declined joining him, she betook herself once more to the river tree, taking from the hall taUe a volume to solace her retirement. On looking at her book it proved to be that rare treasure, an old novel. We use the term "( treasure," advisedly.  Old novels are treasures. Compared to most of the romances of the pre- sent day they are like a real gem contrasted with a paste imitation. They are racy, quaint, characteristic; intel- lectual adornments rather than literary'abortions. The particular novel now in our heroine's hands was of the sentimental order, but sensible withal. In course of half an hour Julia became interested in the story, and read on, like one refreshed.   38        ERRTNG, YET NOBLE. And as she read she started. For her eye encountered the following passage, which, though found in an old romance, would have done credit to the heart of the most modern author. It occurred as a reflection of the writer, and ran as follows:  "Confession is atonement. Let not men or women ima- gine because theye have committed one fault, therefore they are justified in perpetrating the additional error of decep- tion. We can conceive of no crime (save murder, in which case only God himself cal rest6re the life once taken) which if once confessed is not more than half atoned. She read the words. Then, as if by an electric shock, she comprehended their full meaning, and their applicability to herself. She recognized, too, what she deemed to be the hand of Providence, teaching her in its own way.  And now, with the clear, calm morning light beaming brightly upon her, softened in its intensity by the foliage above her; on this lovely summer morn, we say, a new idea entered into her soul. An idea at which the reader may sneer as ridiculous, extravagant, or as impossible to be conceived by a woman.  And yet which this woman did conceive. The idea, namely, of applying practically to her own case the words which Fate, Providence, or what- you will, had just led her to read.  The idea, in short, of confessiVg her secret to her lover; of relieving her soul, at least, of the sins of concealment and deception, and of revealing to Charles Sin- gerly the full past history of Julia Witherson I "Yes," she criedaloud, though there were none to hear her, "I will not endure this load any longer. He shall know of my folly, my error. He shall heal, and from my own mouth, that I am not what he fondly dreams me. Nay, but he shall not deem me base either, for I am nct. The same lips that tell him my evil, shall also speak to him of my good. He shall hear from me of my temptatiolls, my dangers ; he shall hear :of , my sortrow, my struggles, my changre of life, my reform ; he shall know what I am now, virtuous and loving; he shall   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        89 know what I intend to be, most tender and- most spotless. lHe will see that I have been more sinned against than sin- ning; he will read my heart aright. He is noble and will forgive-and love. If not, if he casts me off, rwhy then; still well. I will at least win my own esteem, and respect myself. Aye, and he will be forced to- respect me also. Better to deserve my own esteem, than to enjoy his love without deserving it. Yes, I feel the words are true. 'Confession is atonement. If I fail in all else, I will at least in the eyes of Heaven wash out my error by confes- sion." She raised in strong emotion herl eyes to Heaven, and at this moment she was really beautiful. Her large eyes were dilated with feeling, and her intellectual features were stamped with the impress of high resolve. And as she I   beheld the clear sky, and the smiling sun, and the summer beauty all around her, she seemed to accept them all as favorable omens, and as indices that Providence was auspi- cious- to her noble resolution. But all strong emotions are necessarily followed by reac- tion, by depression. And thus it was in the present in- stance. Her resolve began to appear to her, what perchance it has already appeared to the reader, extravagant and unnecessary. Why should a few words, in an old novel, a silly book, doubtless; so strongly affect her, and alter a momentous and deliberate resolution? Why, truly?"Let the book say what it would, it surely is Inot necessary for me to reveal what need never be known, what had better never be told. Mere confession cannot change my past, while it would certainly crush my future. For HE would cease to love, or would not wed me. AMen are noCsuch noble or such careless creatures as to overlook such an error as mine, while they would not comprehend my atonement. I will loose him, and with him all. He may not understand me enough even to continue- to esteem me. And I cannot tel him. The mortification would kill me. My very woman-   40        ERRING, YET NOBLE. hood forbids me." These arguments, and many others, equally cogent, which the reader can doubtless himself imagine without our stating them definitely in detail, passed through Julia's mind and combatted her nobler resolve. Meanwhile the day advanced to noon; the sky became somewhat clouded; the glow passed away from Julia's countenance, and the noble light of resolution vanished from ler eyes. , She was in doubt. True pride struggled with false pride, the noble woman struggled with the woman of the world; self warred with soul, principle warred with policy, and Julia was at strife with Julia. And as she sat under the river tree, intent upon the mental conflict, she noticed not that a man approached her; she noticed not even that he quietly seated himself, with a smile at hei abstraction, at her side. But when she felt a hand clasp hers tenderly ; when she felt an arm glide lovingly around her waist; when she heard a voice, saying, in the sweetest tones of manly passion, "Dearest," that simple but most expres- sive word, "Dearest," then she looked up, and beheld, beaming upon her, the handsome face of her lover. He had returned from his ride, eager to rejoin his Julia, and, not finding her at Fairview Cottage, had sought and found her in this her favorite spot. "I have had such a splendid canter this morningo" he said. "It would have been perfect happiness if you had but been with me." "Ah, truant," replied Julia, forcing a smile to her face, that he might not observe her agitation, " you did not think of me, I warrant you. What man on horseback ever thinks of a woman?" "Tay, rather say what -man in love ever thinks of a horse? But what have you been doing during my absence? And now that I look at you, you seem strangely melancholy, nay, I could almost say even sad." "Nonsense, Charles, you are in such excessive spirits this   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         41 morning that any one who is not so merry as yourself seems dull." "Nay, Julia, dearest, a lover's eye is not easily deceived. Something preys upon your mind; something troubles you. Come, what is it? Tell me, darling. You know there should be no concealment between us."  "Concealment, Charles!" "Well, if you object to the word, substitute any other. Come, out with your grief. - Is your pet canary dead? or, has any other like horrible calamity taken place? Well, if you will. not tell me, you will at least permit me to read to you. I see you have a book with you." So saying, Charles Singerly taking up the old novel, glanced over its pages. And now occurred what may seem to many a third special chance or Providence; for, among the first passages on which the- eye of Charles Singerly happened to light, was the very identical passage relating to confession, which had caused such a struggle in the soul of Julia, commencing, Con- fession is -atonement. To acknowledge error," etc. Struck with this passage, and presuming that Julia had not, per- haps, read it, Charles called her attention to it. "Do you agree with the author in these sentiments, Charles?" The question sprung to Julia's lips quick as the lightning flash from Heaven, and most anxiously, anxiously as a ,criminal await- ing his doom, did she abide the answer of her lover. "Yes, dearest," was the reply. "Yes, I agree with every word of this truly beautiful and noble passage Y "' Let me read it to you, Charles, once more. Think upon every word, and tell me then on your honor, dearest, whether you endorse every sentiment. Tell me, for. much depends upon it." She saw her lover's look of wonder at her earnestness, and then hastily reatd the fate-deciding sentences from-the old novel I Her voice was agitated with emotion, but she- read, slowly and distinctly: "Colfession is atonement. To acknowledge error is to demand, as a right, forgiveness. Concealment adds to guilt;   42        ERRING, YET NOBLE. whereas an honest confession absolves crime and compels respect. Confession is atonement. Let not men and women" (these three words she read with especial emphasis) " imagine that be- cause they have committed one fault, therefore they are justified in perpetrating the additional error of deception. We can con- "ceive of no crime save murder" (these words were also parti- cularly emphasized by the reader) " which, if once confessed, is not-morelthan half atoned for." She ceased to read, and her eye asked the question of her heart. "The sentiments are, to my thinking, truly noble and nobly true," was the reply of Singerly. "I must read this work, which contains such glorious ideas." "You adopt them then," ask-ed Julia. "Nay. I do not adopt them, dearest, for I have always held them." Julia smiled. All the flattering words of all the kings on earth could not so have charmed her as the simple,'short answer of her lover. Her mind, agitated by its struggles, received his reply (though, of course, Charles' answer had been merely gene- ral; he had paid merely a passing attention to the passage she had read him, and if he had had the slightest idea of the appli- cation to be -made of it, would have answered very differently)- her mind, we repeat, received his reply as a favorable omen ; as a token that Fate was propitious to her nobler nature; as a Sign that she might confess all, redeem her honor, and still preserve his love. All doubts as to her course were at once abandoned, and to her excited fancy the air, the leaves, the birds, seemed to whisper and to sing--"Confession is atonement." She deter- -mined to atone and to confess; and there and then,allnost be- fore she was herself aware, on that summer noon, beneath that old, giant tree, with her lover seated on the rustic bench beside her, did she reveal her secret to her astonished adorer, utterly unprepiared as he was for so terrible a revelation. She. told him of her mother's death, her father's carelessness, her loneliness, her temptations, her own peculiar and dangerous   ERRING, YET NOBLE.          43 nature. She told him all. She also spoke of her repentance and her reform, and narrated the history of her heart and soul since she had known him. She concluded as follows: "And now, Charles, at last you know me--what I have been, and what I am. I love you too well, I respect myself too much, to deceive you. I am proud, as you know; but my pride is true.   I am too proud to be a hypocrite. The Being who'reads hearts can alone know the depth of my shame, my sorrow, and my repent- ance. He alone knows the greatness of my temptations. He only knows the stainless purity of my present life, and the strength of my resolves for the future. I have not been what I should be ; but Iam not what I have beell. I have proved my love by trusting you with more than life. At the expense of all the woman within me, it may be at the expense of your love itself, I have revealed to you all. It is love that has led me to make this revelation, love passing the common love of woniau,-love,   and a belief that you are not as other men ; that you will have ,obility enough to appreciate me and soul enoagh to forgive me." She ceased; and with dilated eye, from which spoke and sparkled her very soul, and with heaving bosom, she awaited the answer that was to decide her fate. Oh I the wild emotions that raged within her. Hope, fear, shame, pride, sorrow, satis- faction, and many other-feelings, pervaded her; but the chiefest of these was the one destined most to be disappointed--Hope! The day had become clouded ; the clouds were dark and dense, and seemed to preface a storm ; but no tempest could rival the emotions in the breast of the astounded Charles Singerly. - Had the earth opened at his feet, had the trees spoken, had the heavens fallen, had any impossible thing whatever happened, it would have caused him less wonder, less sorrow, less conflict or emotion, than the revelation he had just heard of her own shame from her own lips. His outward man, his form, his face, his eyes, gave every sign of agitation; but all were vain to portray X:   the tumult within him. He looked like the man who, in the powerful phrase of- a modern poet,- , FPoamed at God and died,."   "        ERRING, YET NOBLE. He seemed like one who could have cursed man, Heaven, earth, himself, and perished. It was not often that Singerly al- lowed his feelings to master him ; but when they did, it was terrible. But soon this tempest of the heart subsided, and grief, bitter grief, was the pervading feeling. To a certain extent, hoe appreciated Julia. I He saw her temptations had been great, while her nature and position had been -peculiar. He believed she had repented, he felt that she had to-a certain extent even atoned. That she- loved him, every fibre of his heart proved to him; that she would be in the future all that a woman should be, he would take his oath for. But, as Julia had argued to herself, "HMen are not such noble or such careless creatures as to overlook such an error as hers." And as Charles Sin- gerly was but a man, -the man within him reasoned that, be what else as it might, the fact was patent, that she had fallen. "And shall I take her to my embrace knowing this? Shall a man have power to point at us both the finger of scorn? No, never. Shall I wed a woman whose past life I would fear to have known to the world? Shall I, who have so fondly dreamed of stainless purity, forever deprive myself of all chance of its realization? No--a thousand times, no.", Thus he argued with himself, or, rather, these reflections rushed through his agitated soul. And, reader, if you do not agree in the justice of this reasoning, yet blame not Charles Singerly too severdy. Remember what men, men of the world, even the very noblest of them, are in regard to women, and make every allowance for his fearful situation. "Julia, Julia," such was his passionate exclamation, "I was prepared for, I could have endured everything but this. I could have borne poverty, sickness, scorn, toil, sorrow, even death for thee, or with thee. But to find thee thus, and to know thee this. To hear with my own ears from thy own lips that thou art- what I dare not name. This is indeed too much. I can appre- ciate thee ; I can admire thee. Thou art more sinned against than sinning, Julia. Aye, more, the wild beatings of my heart, as-I pronounce thy name-these tell me, that I love thee still. No other woman ever has or ever can rival thee in my affections.   ERRTING  YET NOBLE.        45 But all my lately-glowing hopes are dead within me. May you be happy, but I never can be. For we can never be whlat till this hour I fondly dreamed we ever would be to each other. Love may, love must remain, but marriage is impossible. To think that thou, my adored, my worshiped one art  . But I blame thee not. Pardon my foolish words. Great God I do all love dreams end as mine have ended? Farewell, Julia. Think not harshy of me ; for I love thee still-shall always love thee--shall never love another woman ; but I must never see thee more. Farewell. God bless you and me, for we slall be sad enough to need his blessing, Julia. Farewell-farewell for- ever." He pressed one long, last, passionate, despairing kiss upon her forehead ; he clasped her wildly, passionately, despairingly in his embrace ; f'or one brief moment he gazed upon her as though it was his last permitted glance upon the glories of Heaven, and then-he was gone. And the sky was now completely covered with dark and threatening clouds; the sun was hidden, and a storm  was brewing; a peal of distant thund-er was heard. Still Julia remained under the river tree, motionless as a statue, withl the last words of her lover ringing in her ears, and his last touch still thrilling through every fibre of her frame. An inde- scribable chaos of emotions agitated her ; but the chiefest now ,were the bitterness of sorrow and the disappointment of despair. For a while she remained motionless. Then a sigh, full of untold meanings of grief, escaped her ; and with that cry issu- ing from the depths of her heart, which always issues from the deptlhs of human healts in the hours of their anguish,-" 1Oil, God!--my God I my punishment is greater than I can bear," she returned to the house-utterly desolate. A few hours, subsequent to the scene just described, there was a terrific thunder storm. The rain came down in torrents, as though the very windows of Heaven were indeed opened. The thunder roared, like the voice of an angry Jehovah ; the light-   e46        ERRING, YET NOBLE. ning flashed, like the glances of an Almighty eye. And while the storm raged, Charles Singerly (who on the plea of pressing business had at once left Mr. Russell's residence) was brooding gloomily over his disappointed hopes ; and at the window of her room in "Fairview Cottage " sat a woman weeping most bit- terly; her pride all forgotten, and only her shame, her love, and her despair remaining. The woman's name was Julia. -    ERRING, YET NOBE.         47 CHAPTER     V. A MAN CHANGES HS VIEWS CONCERNING A WOMAN. Two months have elapsed, and Mr. Charles Sinperly is seated in his comfortable room, in his New York residence. Since his last interview with Julia he has in vain en- deavored to banis4 its recollection from his memory. He has plunged anew into the vortex of fashionable society -at various fashionable resorts. He has flirted with several "belles," and been for a while the favored attendant of beautiful women ; but in vain. Memory still haunts him. Then he has devoted himself to dissipation; to wines; cigars, rides, "hops," supper parties, the card table, etc., etc., but still in vain. He is pursued by memory. Then, as a last resort, he has given up his time to literary pursuits. Always a devotee of poesy, which has ever been to him a refining delight, to which, in his gayest moods, he was glad to betake himself; always a student of literature, which in the midst of his wild life he had ever cultivated with repu- tation and success; he now devoted himself with double zeal to study, to thought, and to the charms of literary composition. But, alas I the spells of literature cannot change the heart; and his heart was full of Julia. And now he is seated in his comfortable room, with all the appli- ances of luxury around him, elegant furniture, numerous books, costly articles of vertu, and yet he is sad, most sad. A step is heard approaching; and one of Singerly's most intimate friends, taking the privilege of intimacy, comes in unannounced upon his meditations. Charles hails the inter- ruption with joy; he is glad of any relief to his "{thick- crowding " thoughts.   48        EREING, YEI' NOBLE. - How have you been, my dear fellow?"' says he, rising to salute his visitor. "I have not seen you for three entire days." "Not my fault, my dear boy, not my fault. You have, concealed yourself from public view during the whole of the period you mention. The ' club' has not seen you, Broad- way has not beheld your handsome face. We imagined that you must either be sick or out of town. So I appointed myself a committee of one to examine into your condition." "I am obliged to you greatly for your kindness. I am not sick as you see; I am not out of town, as I can demon- strate."- "Then you are clearly ' under the weather,' as the phrase goes." "Well, to tell the truth, I am not as gay as I am wont to be. Wearied of dissipation, I presume, or of the weather; I scarcely know which." "Oh, the latter, of course, Charlie; the latter, of course. Who can accuse you of 'dissipation?' Absurd. Absurd, very. True, you are the,wildest young man in Nelw York, so protest all the young women ; but what of that? A false rumor, you know, a mistaken idea, eh, Charlie? But, by the by, now that I think, I must ask you, have you and Miss Witherson quarrelled? People used to say you were en- gaged to her." '          , "My dear friend," replied Singerly, with an affectation of nonchalance. "People now-a-days say anything."' "Yes, Charlie, but I and many other ' chums' of yours used to think that in this case people'were in the right. But, at any rate, you do not visit her as much as formerly. Mi8ss Witherson has become a perfect hermit; Kate Somers seems quite delighted; while old Mr. Russell, who evidently expected you to propose for his ward, is vexed, but pretends to regard the whole affair between you, whatever it is, as merely a lovers' quarrel, which will all come right here- after.}                 i   ERRIN'G, YET NOBLE.  .      49 "Indeed, Mr. Russell does me too much honor. But let us change the subject. How do you flourish? How is the ! v 1 amiable Miiss A , and the charming Miss B , and the accomplished Miss C  , and all the rest of your thousand and one 'flames?' ; "Well, as we have only been separated three days, I hardly see the use of making inquiries which would have to include a much longer. space of time." "Pshaw, my boy, you, are good for a flirtation a day, any time. Three days, three dear ones i" !"But, my dear Charles, you seem to forget that the season is hardly yet 'under weigh.' But, by Jove, my boy, I have something to tell you." "Speak on without fear.  Your king commands you," cried Charles, assuming a theatrical attitude. "Thanks for the permission, sweet prince," replied his visitor, laughingly. "It concerns our mutual friend . Have you heard of the romantic adventure which has fallen to his lot? A romance in which a damsel figures?2" "Else how could it be a romance? But proceed ; I am all impatience." "'Well, it is a rather strange storcy, and each one will bhave his own opinion of the merits of the course adopted by the principal actors. But brief let me be. Our 'mutual' O  . recently met a girl of respectable family, though somewhat below him in social position, not 'of our set,' you know, but very beautiful. G  fell in love with her, was infatuated, in short, and would have married her, despite the difference of their respective stations, but for I I one thing."  "And what was that one thing?" asked Singerly. '"Why simply a strange vonfession that the girl one day made to him, after he had told his love. It seems she had been 'com- promised' two years before she met our friend. She might havi kept the matter secret, and become C---'s wife ; but some ,romantic notions of honor led her, rather than marry him under   50         ERRING, YET NOBLE. false pretences, to reveal all. Strange girl, was she not? but, damme, she must be a noble woman, though a queer one.2 Charles Singerly, though his breast was agitated with emo. tion-though he felt as though a voice from Heaven had been speaking to him through the lips of his friend, presenting to him i, case almost parallel to his own, preserved his self-control, and asked, in an indifferent tone, "And how did C act?" "Oh, C   gave her up. He loved her, and all that sort of thing, bift he could not marry such a woman." "And what do you think of the affair, and of C 's course under the circumstances?" Singerly asked this question quietly, but most anxiously; in his heart he felt as though his fate depended upon the answer. His friend he knew to be, though a " fast man," yet a man of sound sense, good heart, and a fine perception of honor; and, therefore, he awaited most impatiently the decision of this friend on a case so strangely like to his own. "Why, Charlie," was the reply, "I thinli she was a fine girl, and if I had been in C 's place, I really do believe I tould have forgiven her all and married her. No one would ever have been a whit the wiser; and a woman like her would certainly have made as good a wife in the future as though she had never made a mistake in the past. We need not marry a woman for what she has been, but for what she is, and for what she will be. At ail rate, C--- had no claim to be exacting ; for a greater rake than he it would be difficult to find. And for the life of me, Charlie, though I am called ' wild,' and am 'no better than others, yet I cannot see why sin, as they call it, in a male is any less error than precisely the same sin in a female. Crime in a man is as great as crime in a woman. And I am certain that if women were to object, in their choice of husbands, to men who had 'raiked it,' there would be damnably few marriages, that is all. There, now, I have talked out more virtue than I ever dreamed was in me." Our hero made a brief replv to the above-given remarks of his friend, the dialogue was directed into other channels, and in a few minutes the visitor departed.   1,            ERRBING, YET NOBLE.         51 The whole conversation above given did not consume many minutes, and to judge by Singerlv's manner, no-one would have imagined the discourse to have been of more than ordinary in- terest. Yet, in reality, these twenty minutes were a memorable epoch in the heart-life of Charles Singerly. He felt that the judgment pronounced by his friend upon their mutual acquaint- ance, C   , would be the judgment which that friend, and every other honorable man, would pronounce upon his own con- duct. He felt that the arguments of his visitor were correct. Julia's past was past; on earth it need never be known, and in Heaven it would be forgiven. She was indeed noble. And what right had he, Charles Singerly, who had himself betrayed others, to reject lher?  His sin was as great as Julia's, but his repentance and atonement were far inferior. His friend's words rang ill lis ears, and Charles Singerly began to ask his own soul solemnly whlether the course he had taken, subsequent to Julia's confession, had not been a mistaken one?  Whether he ought not to have married her? A mental conflict arose within him in regard to this vital point, which-conflict was not ended in an hour, nor in a day, nor yet several days. With the details of this mental strife we need not weary the reader; his own fancy and heart can suggest them; but we will merely give the final result, as shown in the following scene, which occurred within a brief periocd. *   *      - *   *   *    *   * A  beautiful October day is drawing  to a close, and at the window of her room in Fairview Cottage, sits Julia Witherson Shle has become somewhat thinner and paler since we  saw her last; and hler large eyes seem as though thy had known whtat tears were lately. Her heart-history since her memorable scene with Charles Singerly has been very simple--wounded pride, love, and sorrow; these three have possessed her soul between them ;  of wounded and angry pride there, has been much;  of sorrow there has been more ;  but of love, strongDer than either, there has been most. Now she sits thinking of that glorious night by the sea shore wlhen first he declared his passion; then   52         ERRING, YET NOBLE. she thinks of his last embrace under the river tree, and the eter- nal farewell that accompanied it ;' and then, moved by a strange impulse, she arises, leaves the house, and visits this same old tree, beneath whose branches occurred her great life tragedy. She sits again, for the first time since the scene, upon the rustic seat; and absorbed in bitter meditations, she notices not the lapse of time, neither heeds she the fact that the air is rather chill. She only feels that she is lonely and joyless forevermore, and that repentance, atonement, expiation of the most bitter kind, unenlivened by the light of human love or sympathy, must be hers till death. She longs to die.. But suddenly a voice is heard beside her, a voice that banishes all thought of dissolution, andmakes it sweet to live ; a voice which she had feared she never might hear again. A hand clasps hers, a hand to her more than all the world's wealth beside ; an eye gazes into hers, an eye to her brighter than all the stars of Heaven. The eye looks tenderly, the hand clasps lovingly. The hand and eye are Charles Singerly's, and the voice says,-"Dearest, forgive me ; thou art nobler than I. I have returned never to leave thee more. Forgive me, and be my wife, my honored wife, dear Julia." For a moment, a brief moment, there is a struggle in Julia's breast. Pride, at once her blessing and her bane, spoke evil things within her--"He cast thee off once; it is thy turn now." -But the wonder of joy and the ecstacy of love soon conquered the proud demon. He had returned to her-he loved her still-lie honored her-lie sought her for his wife. Her heart was full ; she could but utter the simple word "Charles," then hide her head on his breast and weep delicious tears. Thus on the same spot where their love was broken it-is renewed ; on the same spot where her dishonor was proclaimed her honor is now restored. And the October evening more than atones for the August noon. *   *   '     * $ $  $  $  Our readers, both male and female, will probably entertain various views concerning the prudence and policy of Charles'    ^    . .

Each one has his own or her own way of regarding these things. But one thing is certain, whether Singerly acted wisely or foolishy, he at least behaved nobly, with an originality as rare as it was honorable to his higher nature. We justify him; others may- censure him; but all must ad- mire him. *   8   :;   t   ,   ,     :  e Chlarles and Julia, after their mutual errors, their mutual repentance, their mutual discipline of experience and sorrow, are at last united in a happy and virtuous attachment. "Poeti- cal justice," as it is called, or tihe general rules of romances, might now leave them to be happy. But, alas! this world is not a romance, and Charles and Julia hlaye still much to under- go. They must be further purified by affliction; new truthls, new lessons, must yet be illustrated in their lives. Therefore we exclaim now,-"Charles and Julia I be ye lovers while ye may."    54          ERRING, YET NOBLE.' OHAPTER VI. i '  THE ORDEAL OF FIRE. A MONTH passed pleasantly.   Charles was eloquent and Julia happr. But at this time a horrible incident took place.  It has no direct bearing on our story, but we introduce its description in this place, as it serves to illustrate the true heroism of our true hero-poet, Charles. It was for his courageous heart, as well as his gifted head, that he was loved by Julia. It is a beautiful and balmy-nilght. The air is mild almost as in summer, and the stars smile, the moon beams as though it were a night in June, and the Roman Catholic church of St. is elegantly illuminated, services of special solemnity being now held within its walls. Exteriorly the church of St. --   presents nothing very re- markable or attractive, but the interior to-night unfolds a scene of great splendor. The edifice is large, lofty, and imposing, and is decorated lavishy with linen and lace draperies, arranged from the ceilings, over the cornices, around the altars, everywhere, in short. And lights abound ; these are even more numerous than the draperies. Lights hang from the roof (which is of timber, and comparatively new); lights adorn the imajestic pillars ; lights are profusely arranged along the sides of the building, between NOTE.-It is almost needless to state that such a conflagration as we describe in this chapter never occurred in the city of New York. But a similar fire did talke place, not long ago, in a South American city. We have taken the liberty merely of shifting the scenery. It, may not be artistic, but it is, at least, permissible. We trust that our readers will not be too critical as to minor details; but pardon us if we succeed in making our .chapter intert esting.

These lights are not only of gas, but oil and candles, bright and 'varied, forim a considerable portion of the illumination. In the midst of this brilliant and imposing scenestand the officiatino priests, within theAholy limits of the sanctuary, arrayed in the gorgeous vestments of their office, assisted by their host of at- tendant accolytes. Clouds of incense ascend towards the skies, the or(ran peals forth its magnificent melody, the voices of the choir make a delicious harmony, and a dense crowd of worship- ers bow their heads (and, let us trust, their hearts,) in mingled ecstacy and reverence. The churclh is filled. There is not a square foot of space to spare; the pews, the aisles, are alike thronged, and the galleries are as crowded as the maill floor. The congregation comprises a comparatively few men anwd very many women, young girls, and not a few children ; the majority belong to the " lower orders," but there is a considerable sprink- ling of the "highber classes." It is a great night, and a great festival, and the lirghts, the music, the services and the people combine to make a scene that vividly impresses the devotional imagination. Earth seems to have assembled in its holiest place to render its homage to its God! It is a sacredT picture. It is almost a vision of heaven. But, alas I we fear it is not very far from heaven to hell, froml bliss to perdition. One simple but potent fact we must here notice with most decided disapprobation. The entrance and exit doors of the cathedral are very small and very few compared to the size of the building.   There is, in truth, but one door of easy access, which is in the center; there are two other doors, but these are narrow and low, and are obstructed by screens, etc., while the large door itself, strange, abominable to relate, closes from the inside. Near the high altar is a small door which leads to the sacristy, but this, of course, in case of a disturbance or accident could only benefit the priests and a few of those of the congregation who chanced   56         ERRING, YET NOBLE. to be near the altar. But to-night people do not think of such trifles as these; what care' they for doors? They have come to witness the'solemn ceremonials of their angust church, and to hear a great archbishop. Directly over the high altar is placed a, well-executed and gigantic image of the Virgin Mother of our Lord! There seems to be a sorrow impressed upon the marble features of the Blessed Mary, a kind of indescribable divine grief. Is she mourning for the death of her Godlike Son? Or has she some premonition of the - fearful fate about to fall upon her devoted worshipers? Be this as it may, she is gloriously adorned to- night. Transparencies and a crescent of fire surround lier sculptured form. Ave Maria! -The services proceed, and the music ascends towards the hea- vens, from which the gentle moon and the softly twinkling stars look down upon the :Church of St. But, God of Heaven  what is this? Look, look each one of you assembled thousands, ancd let the sight not blast you. The cathedral has takeen jire. The illuminated crescent (just alluded to) near the image of the Virgin has overflowed, as it were, has burst its limits, climbs up the draperies, eager to reach the wooden roof, and rolls a horrible torrent of flame. In a mo- ment the altar and the roof are on fire. Like a demon that in an instant has rushed from hell to earth, so suddenly and horri- bly leaps the angry demon of flame, and turning earth into a very hell I The fire has plenty of food to glut its appetite. tIverything- around is of the most inflamuable description. Oil, canvass, pasteboard, paper, wood, linen, lace, all aid, the flames in their course, which is simple, swift and terrific. From crescent to altar, from altar to roof, along the roof and along the sides of the building, seizing all things in their path, and dropping down in various shapes upon the frenzied crowd. Alas! Alas I poor maddened thousands, call upon God or the Virgin: man can- not aid ye now. Ye cannot aid yourselves. All that ye can now do is to die.    ERRING, YET NOBLE.        - 57 True, the City Hall bell even at this moment peals the alarm; true, the Fire Department of ]New York are rushing to your assistance ; but it is too late : "The fierce, the foul, and the hungry fire Burns fiercer and fiercer, and higher and higher, And man can but pray to his God, and expire!" There is nothing more awful, more truly fearful to behold, and above all, to feel, than the rushing and crushing of a mighty mass of people in danger of death, and fleeingo to avoid it. We have often, when at a densely-througed place of amusement, thought, with a shudder, of the possibility of such a rush then and thae ; but now the worst imaginations are more than real. ized. iMen, women and children are actuated upon the instant with the mad instinct of self-preservation, and of destruction to all who oppose them in their frantic career. At the first dart of the flames, after the first loud shriek of despair and horror, the multitude rush towards the great central door and- the smaller doors near it. A few escape in this manner, but alas! the crush of the crowd, pressing with irresistible force upon the doors, which, be it remembered, close from the inside, soon block up and effectually destroy this avenue of safety; for the doors are now closed. Those in the neighborhood of the doors, understanding the true " situation," endeavor to push back the crowd, and to open the gates, but in vain. As well might they strive to lift the church from its foundations as to rule or sway the maddened mob. In the eager whirl a few are even crushed to death, while many are seriously bruised and mangled. Thus with the barred doors in front of them, and the flames advanc- ing beIhind them, they await their dreadful doom. A few of the congregation who happened to be near the altar and the sanctuary when the fire. broke out, rush, spite of the flames, through the little door leading to the sacristy (by which the priests have already escaped), and are thus saved. But their number is but small; the majority of 3*   58        ERRING, YET NOBLE. those near the altar meet with a speedy death from the devour- ing element: while those in the centre of the chuich are exposed to triple danger--fiirst, from the flames advancing from the front; second, from the rush of the crowd, and third, from the falling of -the roof, or of combustibles from above them. The sights, the sounds are most horrible; and the feelings of those who are compelled to see and hear and suffer must be most horrible of all I Well and wisely have holy men and women, from time immemorial, prayed "from sudden death, Good Lord deliver us 1"Hundreds of human beings, frantic, perishing, burn- inrlg Can aught be more terrible? Men and rwovlen are remorselessly seized in the embrace of the spreading flames, and undergo an awful, a sublime, yet a most hideous trals- figuration. First, they are seen, as it were, to shine bright- ly, brilliant in agony; then they shrink up and grow horrible; and at last they appear but as black statues, indescribably rigid, writhing' disgustingly. While those who are not burning are struggling, fear- fully, madly ; literally piled in serried masses; one over the other, grasping, with a death gripe, the forms or garments of those in advance of them, clutching them as drowning men clutch at any objects witlhin their reach. And meanwhile the church blazes towards the heavens, the city is in commotion; news of the calamity has spread like lightning far and wide; relatives and friends stand out. side, praying for their dear ones within; the engines play, the firemen work, and all in vain., ... The wrecs in the church make noises equal to those of Pandemonium! Some curse horribly, others shriek fearfully or wail plaintively. Some groan in the extremity of mor- tal anguish; not a few howl like very devils, while many, thank God in this solemn hour find a refuge from despair in prayer. And amid curse, and shriek, and moan, and howl,    ERING YET NOBLE.        59 and prayer, is distinctly heard the roaring and the hissing of the fire. But what pen of mortal man call do justice to the cmo. tions of the hundreds of human beings confined within the burning church, doomed to death? In some, in most, per- haps, the selfish instinct of self-preservation reigns supreme, though utterly in vain. They anon hope for a moment, then alas! relapse into a but too-well founded fear, and selfish rage and excitement, is all in all. Others -lose a sense of their own peril in anxiety for the safety of 'their dear ones; while others, again, and these not a few, are sunk in the depths of despair, and passively rwait destruction. Here and there are a few devotees who have lost in a frenzy of' religious madness all idea of bodily danger. They chalnt a hymn that sounds more of triumph than of death ; they roll their eyes wildly toward the burnling altar and the fire-en- veioped shrine of the Blessed Virgoin ; then they raise their glances towards the God who looks down upon them through the fiery roof, and in the happy insanity of religious enthusi- asm, they defy death. Others equally religious, but more quiet, solace their last moments with the sublime manual of their church. and die as martyrs. Others perish nobly, vainly endeavoring to shield the personis of their beloved ones by their own destruction. The predominant feeling with some is remorse for the many sins of their doomed lives+; others experience but one emotion, shameful, abject, bodily fear; but why further catalogue what cannot be described? In the centre stand a group of four women a mother and her three daughters.  These ladies came to the clhurch at an early hour this afternoon, so as to secure "good seats for this evening'S services; and their escort, the son and brother, of whom they are all so proud, had artranged to meet them during the services at the church. Now they must die, and outside the building rages like a wild beast, the son and brother,' conscious of the fearful situation of his dear ones, but unable, utterly unable, in any    60        ERRING, YET NOBLE. way to assist them. It is hard to tell at this moment who is most to be pitied, the man without, or the women within. These latter present a most touching spectacle ; wrapped in each other's embrace, they await their death. It rhay come to them in the crush of the crowd ; it may come to them in the agonies of the flame, but come it will from one or both, anrd come it must to all. Oh, God! the agony ill that mother's eye, as she looks upon her doomed dallings I "Would that I could die separately for each one of you, my children. Would I could perish four tires four, so I gould save you three," she cries. "Nay, mother, dear, we die happy, for we die together," replies her eldest daughter, while the youngest says nothing but kisses her mother withl a desperate fondness. "Oh, if I could but see Harry once more," suddenly bursts forth one of the group. Alas! Harry stands outside, praying and cursing, and striving' to reach you in vain. G-od, have mercy upon us, but this is a strange world, and often as horrible as stranrge "Look, mother, look," cries the youngest child, as she raises her head upwards from  her mother's breast. But, at that moment, ere the mother can raise her head to see what so alarms her child, the dreaded danger had fallen upon their heads. The fiery ornaments of ttle burning roof come down upon the- devoted group, and mangled, bruised and burning, they pass with prayers upon their lips from the church to the Throne of God I And "Harry," who stands ,without, is rendered desolate for ever. Some die of suffocation. 'One. young girl, charming, beautiful, whose life has been as merry as it has been pure, with a wealth of curls and a blue laughing eye, calculated to make some lionest lover happy for life, perishes thus miserablj, literally choking to death. She might have lived to be a loving wife and tender mother ; but she has died of suffocation at the age of sixteen. Near the great central door of the church at the first rush of the frightened multitude, a lover and his betrothed had   ^j  .     '    '  ERRING, YET NOBLE.          6J been separated by the crowd, the woman beings some dis- tance behind her lover, and of course nearer destruction. She called to him loudly ; he knew her voice- "It was her voice-he could not err, "Throughout the breathing world's extent "There was but one such voice to himn." Inspired by the sound, he performed a deed of desperation. Alone he fought the crowd like a wild beast ; they rushed to- ward thile door, he rushed from it toward his mistress; he cleaved his way thlrough the multitude, seized the woman of his heart, bore her in his arms, retraced his eager steps toward the door, was crushed against it and had his arm broken in the crush ; still he persevered, still held his mistress. At last he gained the outer air just as the crowd within had closed the doors forever be- hind him and against themselves, and then he fainted. While the incident just related was transpiring, a somewhat similar one took place. .A young woman rushed intohe ch urch, stemmed the firious crowd, seized an aged, woman in her arms, and bore her in triumph to the outer air. This faithful daugh- ter, who had thus, at her own imminent peril, preserved her mother's life, was a woman of sin-an erring wioman. But let us trust that, as she " loved much," so her sins have been for- given her. But some there were who failed in their noble atteimpts to preserve the lives that were dearer to them than their own. Olne glorious fellow rushed three times into the midst of a circle of raging fire to save his sister; but the third time he returned no more. He fell in the flanmes, a victim to the purest sentiments of the human heart ; and we doubt not that he mlet his reward and his sister that night in Heaven. But why dwell upon a few incidents when to do justice to the scene, time and event, would require the pen of a Dickens and the brush of an Angelo? Who can portray the horrors of an awful conflagrationl such as thih? We shudder now as we write of it. How must those haveshuddered who witnessed it or felt it? Outside of the church the scene was one which,- once beheld,   g 62       . ERRING, YET NOBLE. was never to be forgotten. It was a mingling' of noise, bustle; endeavor, despair, agony, hope, prayers, curses, ruslinhg fire, rushing water, belching ellgilles, women, men, children, sublimity and horror. The flames, enveloping the chtrch in their emabrace, roared upwards, and as the ellgines poured their /streams upon them, the two elements fought and hissed, but the fire collquered, and still raged on. There was an indescribable comlmotion il the streets ; a dense crowd of wolmen wringing their hads, a thick mass of men hurrying to and fr o; and over the scene, over alike the flaming churclh with its agonllized inmates; over the agitated mass of humanity outside ; over the shrieks of the dy- ing, the whirling of flame, the dashing of water, the rumbling' of engines, the calls of men, the cries of women ; over the throbbing hearts and the feverish frarnes ; over the reddened church and the dusky city, shone as if in mockery the gentle moon, and looked quietlv, brirghtly down the twinkling stars. On the evening of this conflagration, two gettlemen  were walking leisurely along a quiet street. One was no other than Charles Singerly ; his companion was a ,clerfgyman-a young, handsome, decidedly " stylish ' clergyman. You 'would hardly imagine him to be a priest, for his appearance was by no means technically "clerical ;" yet a priest he was nevertheless. But, thank'Heaven, he was a man also, as well as a clergyman-a rare combination; and it was in his former character, and as an old schoolmate and true friend, that our hero associated with him on intinmate terms. And tilus it happened that to-night Mr. Charles Singerly and the Rev. George Howard (of whom our readers are yet to see a good deaD were w alking together, arm in arm, in pleastant converse. Suddenly, a flame shot up some distance from them towafrds the heavens, and they heard the striking of the bell of the City' Hall. "Where'is the fire?" they asked of one rushing past. The Church of St.  ," was the hurried reply. "Let us hasten to the spot," said Singerly to his companion, "we may be of some service."   "Certainly,v answered Toward, " let us go and do what. we can. But, gracious Hteaven! to-night was to be a great festival at St.   's. Can it be that the congrerration, as well as the clurchl, have cauglit fire I God forbid. And yet it may be so. For mercy's sake, Singe-ly, let us see what we can do for the poor wretches.", 'The friends hastened to the spot. tHoward's apprehensions were more than realized. A few glances, a few words with the bystanders, soon made the new-conmersl acquainted with the sit- uation. "Stay here, Howard, and administer all the comfort you can -to the sufferers in this most horrible affair," said Singerly to his friend. "You studied medicine once ; you can do somethng towards relieving- their bodily pangcs s;i and, at any rate, you can give them spiritual consolation. Spare no trouble or expense ; en- gage all the physicians; get all the mediinles needed. I give you a carte blanche on my purse. I will go to fight the flames and see what I can do that way. I was a fireman once for a while, you know. I mnay manage to salve a poor devil or two. God bless you. I'will meet you here ini an lhour." "My dear fellow," replied the rev. Howard, "I shall share your danger ; I sliall remain with you." "No, my dear George," said Singcerly in answer, "you could do no good with me, you can do good here. You to your line, I to mine. I am stronger than you, you know.7" "Take care of yourself then, Charles." "Oh, never fear me, Howard." 'And with one firm clasping of the hands the friends separated, Charles 1'ushing towards the church, disappearing in the thickest of the cr'owd. Howard acted his part well upon that fearful night. He did all that became a true priest, to whlom Catholic or Protestant were both alilke. For many hours, longa after the fire had ceased to rage for want of more things and persons to -consume, Howard was busy in his holv work. He tended this man, he waited upon that woman; he soothed the last moments of one poor wretch , bandarged the wounds of another ; and gave freely   "        ERRING, YET NOBLE. of his time, his labor and his money (his own as well as his friend's). All that fearful night he never slept, but went from one scene of woe to another, takillng last messages, closing eyes, disposing the bodies of the dead, and kept a cheerful smile upon 1his face, though his sensitive heart was nearly broken with the sorrows he beheld. One- scene he saw that night so impressed him that he never, till his dyitng day, forgot it. It was the sight of a yountg mother nmoaning over the mutilated remains of her only child, a girl of twelve years of aige, half burned and half crushed, Hioward endeavored to console the mother; but one look upon the speechless, endless woe impressed upon her face taught him how vain was all human or, even divine sympla- thy. And he left the stricken parent moaning -"Over the mangled mass of clay "That was her child-but yesterday."' As for Charles Singerly, he was every where where danger was to be met, or a chance of good to be attained. He was soon recognized by some of his old friends of the Fire Depart- ment, and was made useful. His couragre, coolness, and skill rendered him very valuable. And so, like a good Samnnaritan in a state of excitement, he rushed to and fro, now griving directions, now offering advice, and now takinig active- exertion. He w1ns nobly assisted by the noble members of that noble institution, the Fire Department of New York ; an institution as valuable, as indispensable to our city as its priests or its teachers; a n institution to which some of the truest, bravest and most self- sacrificings men that'have ever lived have belong'ed, and to which they have'given their best energies ; and yet an institution un- appreciated, aye, to our shame be it said, often ridiculed or maligned anmonn us. But this is not the place for an eulogium, however well deserved. So let us return to Singerly. As our hero was standing as near as possible to the burning church, taking a comprehensive- and educated view of ' the sit- uation," his eye, glancing up a narrow court, which ran along one of the sides of the church, saw a female figure gesticulating   J lERRINGo, YET NOBLE.                     65 wildly in the air. Looking more intently, he understood at once the fearful position of this woman. On the side of the cliurch next the court, there were several windows, and to the highest of .these (which was more a sky- lig'ht than a window) the woman in question had somehow con- trived, in her desperation, to reach, spite its great elevation. There, as yet almost miraculously unconsumed, she breathed the air instead of inhaling the stifling smoke and the consuming fire. She yet lived, but she could not live there long ; so Charles thought, and so the woman herself seemed to know; for sho shrieked and stretched out her arms for aid. But at that height and through those flames-how could she be saved? Well, it shall at least be attempted. The court was very nar- row, the window at which the woman stood was very high, and the flanes issued from the lower windows of the churclh, darting, as it were, across the court ; the firemen were directing all their energies to the salvation of the adjoining( buildings, all hope of extillnguishing the fire in the church having been abandoned. Singerly rushed to a group of neighboring firemen, and pointed out to them the figure of the frantic female, barely visible at intervals through smoke.  "Let us try to save her," he cried; " bring the lonrgest lad- der." It was brought, and up the narrow, and we could almost say blazing, court rushed a little band of brave men, headed by Charles himself. Once or twice they were driven back, but re- turned again and at last reached a spot immediately beneatlhtAhe window at which stood the despairing female. Spite of the groat difficulties attending such a feat in so narrow a space, underl such peculiar circumstances, they succeeded in raising the ]adder, which nearly reached the window. But who was to tiscend it?  Charles rushed to do so, but a brave fellow was before himal, alld was already half way up. But an,suddeu burst of flame and smoke drove him down. Charles took his place, and, animated and protected by the skill of a fireman and the energy of a   hero, began his ascent. In vain the   "         IB]ERRING, YET NOBLE. flames and smoke conspired to defeat his purpose ; ne mounted, like a pure soul, upward. At last he reached the top of the ladder, and at the peril of life ,and limb received the half mad- dened woman in his arms. He then descended with his great and terrible load. The woman, half crazed through fear, was an almost unmanageable burden; and even Charles beganl to despair of reaching the ground in safety ; but he did each it; and then he, still carrying the now insensible won n, and his companions, bearing the ladder, rushed from the fiery court. As Charles paused to look back for a second, he wondered how he had ever contrived to do what had been done ; and then our hero's thoughts went silently up in thankfulness to -Ieavoen. 'Tis midnight ; and the fire which once raged so furiously now merely smoulders among the ruins of the church of St. All, too, is comparatively quiet. Yet the scene is as fearful now as it was hours ago, more terrible, in fact. The quiet is the quiet of death, of completed destruction. Neither is it so quiet, after all. For ever and anon we hear a groan from the ruins, a cry from the soul of some dying mass of burned and bruised matter, which was once a human being ; or, perhaps, it is the shriek of some loving heart, which sees its dear one senseless, soulless, almost shapeless,- before its eyes, Oh, God of light I how canst, thou suffer thy moon and stars to look down upon such a scene as this I Oh! it is too horri- ble I These dense crowds of bones and ashes and remnants of humanity ; these distorted, calcined, black statues, that were once young men or beautiful maidens ; these horrible and once human faces wearing the awful look of their supreme agony; these heaps of departed life ; these multitudes of dead forms, some mutilated, some crushed, some wholly burned, E some only half consumed, but all alike dreadful, and what is more than dreadful, disgusting! "Can there be a Good? Or, if there is a God, can he be a God of love? Can he who sends, or at least permits, earth. quakes, battles, volcanic eruptions, and wholesale conflagrations,   R . - W ERIN,  YET NOBLE.     67 can He be a loving, merciful Deity? Can He, indeed, be the Heavenly Father of his earthly children? Can He who destroyed the church of St.    by fire, catn . e be ' our Father who art in Heaven?'V So says Charles Singerly, half to his own heart, half to his friend, the Rev. George Howard, as they stand, long after midcl night, looking at the smouldering  ruins of the church of St. The doubt expressed ip Singerly's words is natural under the circumstances; but Howard replies: "Ah, Charles, if we could but see all, the souls above as well as these poor mangled bodies below, we would not doubt there ,is a God, and that this God is love. The immortal part of many a one whose mortal part now festers near us is even now rejoicing in the 'bliss eternal, and the glory everlasting. They have suffered a moment, but they will enjoy for an eternity. Believe me, Charles, most of those who lhave gone from earth to-night from the church of St.     would not return if thley could."', Singerly feels that Howard is rig'ht. And Julia, when she heard the history of this night, thanked God she loved so noble a man as Charles    G8  .      :ERRING, YET N-OBLE. CHAPTER VII. A LETTER FROM A MOTHER. IN one of our preceding chapters we alluded   to Sing. erly's mother, who was traveling in Europe. She had been abroad over twelve months, and had visited England, France and Italy, and was now expected home. She had gone in com- pany with a large party of friends-her son, on account of some important business matters connected with his father's will, being unable to accompany her. Charles had often spoken of his mother to Julia, who had learned, by the description, to love' her; for in the eye of our hero his mother was the most perfect of created beings-no. son ever loved a parent more dearly than Charles his mother; and this affection was fully recip. 'rocated. A constant correspondence, as frequent and as regu- lar as circumstances would permit, was maintained between the parties during their absence ; and, of course, in these letters the subject of Charles' engagement was mentioned, and his mother had sent back a loving reply to his first joyful letter communi- cating the intelligence; which will come more fully under our notice shortly. Suffice it to say, that this reply supposed, of course, that Charles had chosen a wife alike religious and spot- less; for a consistent " profession of religion," and a reputation utterly free from suspicion, were, in Mrs. Siugerly's eyes, the sine qua non of a, wife for her son. Suffice it to say, also, that Charles, though wholly unused to concealment, espe. cially towards his mother, after a struggle with himself was obliged, by the necessities of his position, to determine to allow her to remain in utter ignorance of the fact, that his chosen loved one lacked alike the religion she required and the stainless- ness she adored.  He felt now that through life he would have   ERRBING, YET NOBLE.          69 to keep at least one vital secret from his worshiped mother; that in at least one respect he would, as lon(g as he lived, be compelled to deceive her. Mrs. Singerly, as will be more fully seen hereafter, was a, pure, sensible, strong-minded, loving, good woman; but she was also bigoted in religious or church matters, and decidedly " strait- eaced" in regard, to female nlorals and decorum, consequently she was an iconvenient personage to be intrusted with such a secret as that of Julia's. One day, in the early part of November, Charles had been paying a visit to his betrothed in the afternoon at Mr. Russell's town residence. While there, havilg occasion to produce some- thing fromll his pocket, he had accidentally and without either himself or Julia observing it, dropped a letter. Some time after he had taken his leave, Julia, passing through the apartment, ob- served, this letter, ignorant, of course, what it was or where it had come from. She stooped to pick it up, and as it had no envelop she glanced at the writing, which was remarkably like that of a friend of hers, so, taking for granted that it was some note froim her friend which she had carelessly dropped, she thoughlt she would spend a moment or two in reperusifng it ; and approaching the window, leanilg against the wall, glanced over the pages. The light was growing dim, but there was enough for her purposes,. She was soon aware that she had made a fatal mistake in hler suppositions in regard to this letter : it was not hers ; it was not from her friend; it was an epistle belong- ing to. Charles Singerly, and written to hm by his mother-by lier future parent; and its tenor was of her. She, the future wife of the writer's son, was the subject of this letter. Havintg read a few lines, sufficient to give her, before she was aware, an idea onfly too true of the nature of this epistle, she felt an irre- sistible curiosity to continue its perusal ; she felt as though her fate la y in its words, and she read on.  The letter was not a long one, but it was full of the charac- ter of the writer; it showed her deep love for her son, his ill- tense passion for her; it evinced the perfect, entire, urreserved   70       .   ERRING, YET NOBLE. confidence that had ever existed between them; it proved the writer to be a truly loving' and good woman, and a. true mother. The letterthen proceeded as follows : (' Give my love to Julia, my daughlter ; for she is my daughter. Charlie, I have taken her to my heart already, for she, I know, is, must be, as lovely as she is pure; else would she not be a true woman, nor capable of being a true wife, and else would not you love her. I have often dreaded your marriage, for I was fearful that you might, some day, love a woman unworthy of you. And words cannot tell you, my dear son, how great would be my agony did I see you linked to a woman on whose character the slightest stain could rest. Better be dead than unhappily married. And were I myself dead, and were you to wed an unworthy woman, I verily believe I would arise from my grave." In another part of the letter occurred this passage :-"There never has been any concealment between us, my dear son, and I know there never can be. Could I imagine that the time would ever comoe when 'a secret would lie undisclosed between us, I would be most wretched; and I know you too well to suppose that you could be happy so long as any concealment on any important point existed between us."'- (Our readers can well imagine why Charles had never men. tioned to Julia the receipt of this, and similar letters, from his mother.) Julia read and then various emotions agitated her. Sllh seated herself on one of the - luxurious sofas by the window, near which she had been standing while perusing the epistle, and abandoned herself for a moment to her feelings. The dim, dreary, waning light that entered the room from without, was strangely in unison with her sensations. Admi. ration for the character and sentiments of Charles! mother, as displayed in the letter she had just read, and love for the writer, because the writer so loved her lover; these were mingled with sorrow that she was so unworthy of the praises bestowed upon herself, and with deep regret, aye, loathing, at the thought that she must hereafter be loved by Charles' it'other for the very quality she does =wt possess. *      lo'   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         71 Julia also experienced deep sorrow when she thought, that from her peculiar position, she would be forever the cause of at least one vitally important secret existing between this son asnd mnother, who heretofore had- had no concealments or deceptions between them. Charles, at least, on one point must deceire his mother; and that point his own wife I The thoughts of these necessities of her position were agony to the truth-loving Julia. And yet what could she do? Her early error wastl-nging in its foul train still further pllnish- merits. And as she gazed through the window into the din street, with an unchecked, bitter tear in either eye, little did the passers by dream that -within that lordly mansion, with its brown stone front, there beat as unhappy a heart as ever throbbed within a hovel. The light grew fainter and fainter, and evening had fairly set in; the servant entered the par- lor to lioht the lamps, btut Julia dismissed her; she wished to remain iii a congenial darkness. But suddenly a new idea took possession of her soul. An original, absurd, useless idea, the reader may call it, but at any rate it entered into her soul. "Why not confess to the mother as uwell as to the son?? Why practice deceptioll and concealment to the former more than to the latter? Why not be as truthful and as honest to the parent as to the lover? I have overcome the prejudices of the one, why not those of the other-? This course would be the noblest, the truest, and therefore the course most worthy of me. It would be 'lso a further step in my atonement. Even being rejected by the mother, but with no concealment or decep- tion between us, would be better than being loved by her under false pretences." Various other arguments, or what seemed to be arguments to her. excited fancy, in favor of this course, flashed across her mind. Her eye kindled with enthusiasm. , She rose from her seat, and paced the richly carpeted floor with a proud step; she felt like a queen, liko a warrior about to gloriously conquer in a glorious clause. But all- this excitement was followed by tie inevitable   E2 BERRING, YET NOBLE. reaction, and soon this idea of hers began to appear less plausible, less necessary, less noble, even, and far less likely of success. All the various arguments against its adoption (which arguments we can safely afford' to leave to the reader's sense and fancy to imagine) crossed her mind in quick succession. The glow faded from her face, the sparkling light no longer kindled in her eye ; she resumed her seat, a prey to doubt and a host of conflicting emotions. At last her mind was made up. "I will not now deter. mine upon my course whether of continual concealment, or of confession. There is time enough before me ; I will await the return of Mrs. Singerly from Europe, which is expected in a week or two, and ascertain her character from personal observation. I will think the matter over carefully 'and conscientiously; will consult what is best, and most fitting for all ; I will consult alike principle and policy; I will mean- while say nothing to Charles, and at last I will definitely determine whether to confess all, or to conceal all forever." There, in that dark parlor, with no companion save her own soul, and with no light save that which the street lamp afforded, for the starlight of heaven could not reach her in that lordly room ; there, on that luxurious sofa, with all the appliances of her uncle's wealth about her; there and then, on that November evening, did Julia Witherson make a solemn vow, to the effect above stated, and there and then was this vow, of an erring but noble spirit, registered by the recording angel. f    ERRING, YET NOBLE.         73 CHA PTER TIII. A WOMAN CONFESSES TO A WOMAN. IN due course of time Mrs. Singerly returned from her Euro- pean tour, and Charles took the earliest opportunity of making her acquainted with his betrothed. And Julia soon learned to  j love Charles' mother, who in her turn reciprocated the affection. Mrs. Singerly was a " little woman," ladylike in her appearance and elegant in her dress and manner, with an expressive face, which, though sedate in its general look, could beam most ten- derly upon those she loved; and beam it ever did upon her son, her almost worshiped Charles. We doubt if, in her own secret heart, she did not really believe that " her boy," like the king, " could do no wrong ;" even his non-profession of religion, even his dissipation, though they pained her, could not sever the least of the tender ties-that bound her to him. As for Charles, his mother was his idol. We have just stated that Mrs. Sing- erly soonl learned to like, even to love, Julia,; not only for Charles' sake, but for her own. Our heroine, it is true, was not re- ligious; but (as she had always, since her return from Frances veiled from view her sentiments of doubt, had complied, to a certain extent, with the orthodox forms of the church, and as she had at heart a deep abiding sense of natural religion,) Mrs. Singerly was not aware of the extent of her deficiencies in this respect. Julia's intellect also charmed Mrs. Singerlv, who was an ad- mirer of talent; though she oftewondered at the strange char- acter of the studies to which her son's betrothed had devoted herself. Her noble sentiments, also her music, conversational powers, her personal appearance, her generosity in pecuniary matters, -her independence, her courage, her fascinations; abovo 4    74;        EARIN, YET NOBLE, all, the knowledge that Charles loved her, and the firm belief that her .character was as spotless as the new-born snow; all these were reasons why Julia won the love of Charles' mother. And our heroine learned to love Mrs. Singerly for her purity, her' true religion, her real goodness and kindness of heart, and most of all, because she was the loving and beloved parent of her lover. And for awhile the betrothed couple and their mother were united and happy. But in the depths of her soul Julia still remembered her recent vow; her determination soon and. finally to decide upon permanent, thorough and lasting con- concealment, or full and open confession; and many were the struggles within her in regard to this matter ; struggles of which her lover knew nothing ; struggles known only to God and to her own soul; struggles which the mother, that all-important personage, never so much as dreamed of. It was a beautifiullafternoon in the month of December: one of those mild afternoons with which winter favors the earth occasionally to remind it of the summer that is past, and to cheer it with hopes of that which is yet to come. The air was balmy, the sky cloudless, and all nature, so far as it could be visible in a city, seemed rejoicing. And at the window-of one of the rooms in her elegant mansion sat Mrs. Singerly thinking. Her thoughts were pleasant ones, judging by the smiles that occasionally crossed her lips ; aye, pleasant thoughts they were truly; for she was musing oa the happiness that awaited her son, her darling Charles. "He has made a worthy choice," so her meditations ran; " he has found a lovely, pure and talented woman, who, though not now quite as religious as I could wish, loves him dearly. She will be to him, doubtless, -a good and faithful wife, and to me an affectionate and fond daughter. Charles will. 'settle down ' in life, and will surrender those wild courses which have pained me so much, and which, for my sake, he has so often struggled against. He will become the head of a family, a fond husband and father ; and I," here the old lady smiled as the suggestion crossed her mind, "I will be-   ERRWG, YET NOBLE.          75 come -a 'grandmama,' a doating grandmama, to some curly- headed, mischievous little cherub." Then her thoughts took another turn. "By the by, supposing I was to pay Julia, my daughter, as she soon will be, for Charles, the impatient rascal, has already prevailed upon her eo 'name the day ;' supposing I was to pay her ' a call ' this 'aternoon, an unexpected, informal affair. She will be pleased, I know, and then I shall have a chance of seeing Charlie, too; for I am certain the fellow is with her at this very moment." So Mrs, Sinbgerly proceeded to act upon her own suggestion, and attiring herself hastily, with better spirits than she had known for many years, she departed to pay a visit to her future daughter-in-law. Little did she imagine what would be the momentous consequences of her visit. Ah! little; truly, do we creatures of a day know what an hour may bring forth I M On reaching Mr. Russell's door she met his youngest child, a little girl of some six or seven years. Asking the child, she ass certained that Mr. and Mrs. Russell were out, but that Julia and a gentleman were "in the parlor." Smiling, as she thought who " the gentleman" was, she took the privilege of intimacy, passed through the open entrance-door, and entered the parlor ; but to her surprise the room was vacant. She ran back to in- form the child of its mistake, but the child, too, had departed. "'I will wait a moment," thought Mrs. Singerly, "they will make their appearauce presently, and I will agreeably astonish them." So she returned to a seat near the window ; and as the shutters were partly closed, her form was thrown somewhat into the shadow. Now the parlor was a double one, with fold- ing-doors between the two divisions, and one of these folding- doors, next to the side of the room at which Mrs. Singerly was seated, happened to be drawn full across its share of the en- trance; so that, as the light was equally dim in both parlors, a person seated in the one room could not perceive a person seated in the other on the same side. Mrs. Singerly had not been seated many moments before two persons entered the back parlor, of course utterly unconscious of the presence of any third   ERRING, YET NOBLE. party; and by their voices Mrfis. Singerly recognized them to be the very ones she wished to see. She rose quietly, and was about to 1" steal a march upon them," when suddenly she heard them utter words, words of fearful import, which at once de- prived her of all mirth, and even of strength to enable her to render her hearers aware of her 'presence, so greatly was she grieved and astonished. "Nay, Charles," said Julia, in reply to some previous re- menstrance of her companion, " it is vain for you to endea- vor to alter my resolution. I shall never be truly happy, or truly honorable, until I have told your mother all ; until she knows me to be what I really am ; until she is aware of, my erring past. I determined upon this step weeks ago, ever since I read by accident that letter firom your mother; that letter which I handed to you the next day, and which, as you supposed, I knew naught of its contents, you were so unwilling to talk to me about. But I determined not to take a fearful step, like this confession, lightly. I deter- mined, to study my own heart, you, and your mother ; I re- solved to be guided in my decision by feeling, prudence, but chiefly honor and principle, for honor and principle alone can render me worthy of your love. I said naught to you on the subject for many reasons. But now I have seen, I have studied, have reflected, and I have determined. I must tell all to your mother." The revelation to Charles, of which these words were part, of the thloughts and designs of Julia in reference to his mother, not only came on him as a new idea, upon which he had not hitherto thought, but as an idea which placed him in a most embarrassing position as to how to advise or act. He ardently desired, on general principles, that no conceal- ment should exist between himself and mother; and it cer- tainly was Julia's most noble course to reveal all. But, on the other hand, it was certainly not absolutely required by honor, that Julia should make any further confessions, which certainly would tend to separate them forever. There   ERRINO, YET NOBLE. were other reasons, too, against confession, and therefore Charles opposed Julia's resolution. "Nay, Charles, say what you will, a, fill confession to your mother of my early temptation, my early error; such a confession, alas! as this accompanied, thank Heaven, by a statement of my repentance, my atonement; such a con. fession, Charles, is my noblest course, and should therefore be taken for honor's sake ; it is the course most worthy of letter nature, and should therefore be taken for my own true pride's sake ; it is the course most bitter and most diffi- cult, and should therefore be taken by me for the sake of expiation and atonement. I have seen lately how the idea of having a vital secret that you dare not disclose to your imother has a ffected your happiness; I have wearied receiv- ing constant praises from your mother for the possession of that to which, in her sense of the term at least, I can lay no claim. Think you I shall be happy if I become your wife and her daughter at the expense of your peace of mind, your filial love, and her deception?" "But, Julia," interrupted her distracted lover. "Nay, Charles. I only must now speak. Something tells mra too, that my confession will be, even practically and as a matter of policy, the best thing hereafter for us both. The secret instinct of my soul assures me this: your mother loves you fondly ; she likes me; she has a noble heart, a heart that can understand and forgive. For your sake, for mine, and for the sake of her own noble heart, she will par- don my great but my early error, so bitterly repented of. You have pardoned me ; why should not she?" "Ah, my Julia, the cases are not similar"--- "Grant that they are not," replied Julia ; "assume that ,the worst that can does happen. Still I will repent me not of mv confession. I will be acting rightly, proudly, repent- antly and nobly. Even your mother, despite herself^;will be forced to respect me, esteem me. I will be able at last to respect myself. I will teach the world, at least my world,   78 RTNG, YET NOBLE. that spite of heartless doctrines and hideous sneers, a woman may sometimes stray, yet not be utterly lost, may still re- pent, and still atone; in short, that a woman may be ' erring, yet noble.' " And as she thus spoke, Julia was truly beautiful, a wor- thiy -physical exponent of the glorious truth she uttered. Her eye flashed, her head was elevated, her neck proudly arched, her form dilated, her bosom heaved magnificently; - and though the room was dark, there almost seemed to be a light around her-at least it seemed so in her lover's eyes. But to her lover's ears, alas I her words 'sounded like the knell of hope, and as he gazed upon her in the waning light she seemed to him like a treasure forever lost. But see- she starts. In her excitement she has advanced towards the adjoining  parlor; and suddenly her eye has discerned a third person ; rushing forward, a startled exclamation from her lips informs the astonished Charles that his mother is present, and has heard all-she mnst have heard it. It is beyond the power of any ordinary pen to-do full justice to the emotions of the various parties to this scene. Julia feels that she has unwittingly revealed the secret of her life to the mother of the man she loves, and that the crisis of her fate is reached. Charles is agitated with conflicting sentiments that overpower him;   the mother, whom he re- veres and worships, is possessor of a fatal revelation that concerns his peace and that of the mistress whom he loves and adores, while the mother herself is swayed to and fro by the strong currents of opposing feelings. There in those darkening parlors are the three who are near- est to each other, and dearest; the three who have a dreadful secret amongst them, that threatens to sunder them forever. There they are, in the dim parlors, on that December evening, gazing into each other's faces. There stands Julia, with pride and shame struggling for the mastery on her expressive counte- nance; there sits the mother, looking alternately on her son and her (would-be) daughter ; while between them stands Charles.    EBRREING YET NOBLE.                       79 For a moment none of the three dare break the silence; their hearts are far too full to suffer their lips to speak. At last the mother opens the momentous conversation: "Miss Witherson, I have overheard by accident strange words-words of fearful meaning.  Are they true? But it is needless to ask that question. The peculiar circumstances under which I have heard them do not admit of a doubt on this point. Miss--Miss Witherson, I know not for what to take you." "Take me, oh, take me, dear madam," cries Julia, in tones of passionate entreaty, which have no pride in them now, only tenderness and sorrow, " take me for that which I am-a woman who has erred under most peculiar temptations, but who has repented and forsaken her errors ; a woman who has fallen, but who has also risen ; a woman who loves your son and you." And then, with all the inimitable and almost resistless elo- quence of true feeling, she narrates her story. She speaks of her strange nature; her motherless condition; her Parisian education; her temptation ; her fall ; her change of views ; her struggles; her desertion by her false lover ; her sorrow, repent- ance, shame; her sincere love for Charles, and her full and honorable confession to him. She then speaks of the love she bears to her, the mother of her Charles; and gives the reasons that caused her to resolve to confess all rather than deceive her. Then Charles, in eloquence little inferior to Julia's, pleads for the woman he loves to the mother he loves ; he says all that a lover, a man, or a son can utter under the circumstances. The heart of the sedate, dignified Mrs. Singerly beats more rapidly now than it has beaten for many years. She would die for the happiness of that son, who is clasping her hand and r gazing  so fondly, yet so anxiously, into her face. She cannot but pity the sad history aud even admire the true honor of that lovely but ill-fated girl, whose large eyes would weep doubtless were not her feelings far too deep for tears ; but PREJUDICE can not be eradicated in a moment; education and habits of thought cannot be changed in an hour.   ^ 80      t ERRDGo, YET NOBLe. And now, in that dim room, into which the faint light drearily steals, the mother speaks words which sound like the fiat of eternal judgment in the ears of the listening lovers. "Miss Witherson," she says, and her words are distinct and firm-her agitation is over,--"I have heard your story with wonder, with pity, with a large degree of respect. But you will pardon me when I say that, by your own showing, you are not the woman the world supposes you to be ; you are not the being, I had fondly imagined you ; you are not, in short, (pardon me if in,my plainness I offend you), such a wife as I desire for my son. I Wish you well; I trust you may obtain every happiness; but I must and do withdraw my consent to your union with my dear and only son. Your union is impossible ; it cannot take place." The words are spoken. Tile words that are meant to sepa- rate her from her loved one forever. And there and then, in that darkening room, Julia feels most fearfully how great is her heart's darkness. She seems calm ; but she feels now hot as fire, now colder than ice ; for pride contends with shame, while sor-' row overpowers both emotions.' She raises her head, and strives to appear like the haughty Julia of times past, but in vain. And Charles' emotions are by no means enviable.   He feels the justice, the worldly and accurate justice, of his mother's decision; and yet his love for Julia is so great, he had dreamed so many delicious dreams concerning her, he experiences such horrible despair at the prospect of losing her, that his whole soul revolts at- the idea of parting with her. And suddenly tho thought crosses his mind-it was the first and -last time such a thought ever'occurred to him ; it was a thought that could not leave entered his imagination, saving at a moment of intense ex- citement such as the present-the thought of disregarding his mother, and wedding Julia at all hazards, with or without his mother's consent. While this idea agitates his soul, Julia, whose nerves have been strung to the highest tension, suddenly bursts into tears   EREINO, YET NOBLE.          81 It is merely a physical, not a moral, weakness on her part; but the sight of these tears excites Charles almost to madness. He rushes to her ; he folds his arms around her; he calls her his own ; he kisses her passionately, and exclaims: "No human being shall part us ; no mother shall sever us ; thou shalt be mine and I thine, Julia, despite the world." For a moment Julia reil ed encircled in his loving embrace ; and she is tempted to taliim at his word. Why should a third party, be she whom she may, separate two souls who so dearly love each other? Why not disregard the mother and re- ceive the son forever? Various reasons why she should so do flash across her mind. But she raises her head and sees- that tears of sorrow are in the aged eyes of Mrs. Singerly; tears of sorrow at the disrespect and threatened disobedience of a loving and beloved son, and, at the sight, Julia's nobler nature con- quers. She disengages herself from the arms of her lover. and says to him simply, tenderly, but firmly and proudly: "No, Charles. Much as I love you, I can -not, will not wed you, without the consent of your mother. My own honest pride, (thank God I have a right still to cherish an honest pride in this matter at least,) forbids me. We could enjoy no true hap- piness together were I the means to part you from your oPly parent, she who so tenderly cares for you-I will force her to forgive me, to respect me yet. But against her will I will not wed you, Charles." The lovers' embrace is broken-and Charles and Julia, like their future lives, are now apart. Then occurs a brief but'mllost expressive silence. Each of the three actors in the scene is occupied with his or her emotions Slightly altering a famous couplet- "There was silence deep as death, And the saddest held their breath For a time." During this interval of stillness the growing darkness of the room is strangely, strongly in keeping with the deepening men-   821    -t UAloRIN., YET NOBLE. tal shadows that are thronging through theo chambers of their souls. And though past the mansions, through the streets of New York, there go to and fro; hosts of beggars, we doubt if any member of this wretched class is half so sick at heart as are the three who breathe here heavily in this darkness and this silence. But at last Julia breaks the pause. She has looked at the worst-is prepared for it-and now -endeavors to anticipate its action. All is over. They must part. Let them part then at once. She turns to .Mrs. Singerly. "Madam," she says quietly, "we must end this unexpected and alas I most unpleasant inter- view. You know my secret-you will of course respect it-if not mtyself. I speak no more of my sorrow, of my humiliation -my pride will not stoop to any alliance that satisfies not the family of the man I love. The time may come, madam, when you will do me justice. Your image will ever live in my memory as that of one whom I could have loved." The words of our heroine imay sound somewhat harshy and proudly--but remember, reader, that Julia had humbled herself -and in vain-is she not pardonable therefore in her resort to her last refuge, her pride? But to Charles her manner is full of a most exquisite tender- ness. She offers him her hand, and when he not only takes the hand, but clasps her wildly, passionately to his breast, she gel- tly disengages herself, and kissing his forehead, she bids him farewell. "Charles," she says, "I shall ever love you-but I may never marry you. I shall never wed another. You are the only man whom I have ever really loved-the first and the last of my- heart. But I release you from all ties to me. You are free to find some woman more worthy of your love than I have been or can be. If you find such a one, be happy with her ; and remem- ber me only as one who owes her noblest qualities to her love for you. Farewell. Farewell. I had dreamed to redeem in 'the happy character of your wife the errors of my fatal past- but my dream was not to be-it should never have been. I   ERRIING  YET NOBLE.         83 shall henceforth live- not for love but for repentance. The time may come when your mother shall better understand me. The time may come when the, world may learn that a woman may be ' erring, yet noble.' Farewell, Charles. Good-bye, dearest, and heaven bless you." The last sentence is uttered in a tone of the most musical ten- derness, which rang in its hearer's ears for many months after. But there is no reply.  Mrs. Singerly was silent. She loved her son; her withdrawal of her consent to his union was dic- tated chiefly by her view of his best interests; still she felt in her own despite, how noble Julia -was. Charles was silent. What words could have spoken fitly his emotions? And Julia, to end this soul-harrowing scene, rings the bell for the servant to bring in a light, and instantly at the menial's entrance the parties became mere men and women of the world; mere "Iadies" and " gentlemen " with whom any show of feeling is inadmissible. And Mr. Charles Singerly and    Mrs. Singerly take their leave of Miss Julia Witherson politely!   For the servant stands in the hall. But spite of social habit, spite of servants, passion would have its, wa, and unperceived, Charles gave Julia one last, clinging, passionate clasp; one last; long, passionate kiss; whispered to her, "There must be a heaven where we shall meet again, if on earth we cannot ;" and-was gone. The door closed upon the mother and son ; the stars shone here and there in the'sky ; the lights were lit in the parlor, but love and hope had departed forever from the breast of Julia. NoTEm.-Doubtless the reader has already deemed them very strange, these numerous (and perhaps many would call them needless) confessions by our heroine. It may seem very unnatural that a woman should reveal, without any direct external necessity, such a secret to her lover, and still more un- natural that she should insist on revealing it to her lover's mother. But our experience of humanity has convinced hs that there is nothing unnatural to human nature; it is capable at once of the highest, the lowest, the meanest, the noblest, the most common and the most uncommon of actions. And we think that a powerful, somewhat morbid, enthusiastic, guilty, glorious, strange woman like Julia Witherson, placed in her very peculiar circumstance, would act as we have described.  84        ERRING, TET NOBLE. CHAPTER IX. OF SORROW IS BORN RESOLVE. FOUR hours have elapsed since the parting- recorded in our last chapter. It is moonlight. From the clear blue sky of a mild De- tember night the moon is pouring plenteously forth her streams of glory. The air is, as winter airs go, balmy ; and lovers promenade, and seem to forget that it is not summer. It is, to be brief, one of the most delightful of conceivable nights in winter. To-night, Miss Kate Somers is seated in her luxurious room, close to a fire, reading a French novel, planning new flirtations for the coming week, devising fresh triumphs of coquetry and heartlessness, and cursing the intimacy of her friend  Julia with that "great catch," Charles; an inti- macv which she dreams not no longer exists.  Meanwhile, the moral and honorable Henry Hericot is engaged in ca pti- vating  some new victim; using his face and accomplish- ments for the devil's purposes. Meanwhile, Mr. Russell, Julia's guardian, has returned several hours sooner than was expected; and not finding Mr. Singerly with his ward, as usual, expressed some sur- prise. And then Julia infornmed him in a few words that " the engagement" between Charles and herself was at an end; and quietly but decisively refused to give any informa- tion, requesting that nothing furtLher should ever be men- tioned on the subject. Meanwhile, Mrs. Singerly has retired to her room; her heart full of sorrow and her soul full of wonder at the dis. closure of the last few hours. All the bright dreams which but this very afternoon she had cherished for her son are   I              ERRING, YET NOBLE.        85 now dispelled. Mingled admiration and disgust for Julia, and mingled love and pity for Charles possess her spirit, but her resolution is unchanged. Charles has also retired to his " study," and, locking fast the door, to prevent all intrusion, even from his mother, has abandoned himself to his despair. It is rarely that men weep, very rarely do tears fill the eyes of those who are, by the birthright of their sex, " the lords of creation ;" but if you will look at Charles now, you will find that, though his face is hidden in his hands, large tear-drops are trickling through his fingers, and that his whole frame is convulsed with emotion. Gods! it is a fearful sight thus to witness strong men in their agony I more fearful still when the contrast of the woe within is so great when compared with the luxury and comfort all around the sufferer; and with the beauty of the pale, sweet, soft, tender moonlight; that steals through the window, and falls full upon the form of the weeping wretch, who sees it not, and recks not of it. And Julia is seated at her piano, playing plaintive melodies in quick succession, each melody more melancholy than the one which preceded it. She, too, has wept; but not long; she cannot afford to weep; there is too much sorrow in her future for her to indulge in the luxury of tears. She has endeavored to fix her mind upon her favorite, stranrge, meta- physical studies; she has striven in the depths of mental mysteries to forget for a while her plain, tangible agonies but in vain. And now she sits at her piano, throwing her whole soul into her fingers, and making the instrument speak for her to the ears of Heaven. Never did Lizt, Thalberg, Chopin, Gottschalk, De aMeyer, perform as did, at this hour, Julia Witherson. Each  chord sounds like the wail of a breaking heart; like the voice of her own soul, which tells her "Henceforth there remains for thee no love, no joy, only sorrow and expiation." Then she goes to the chandelier, lowers the gas-light, and opens wide the shutters. And then rushes in a tide of  86        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Heaven's most delicious moonlight, flooding, as it were,- her whole countenance with radiance. To her excited fancy it seems as though this beautiful light was a messenger of good tidings. As though Heaven smiled upon her, even in the depths of sorrow. A mental reaction ensued from the despairing state into which she had been driven ; hope and resolution take possession of, her soul. And there and then, on that December night, with the moonlight shining full upon her intellectual face and queenly form, her eyes dilating with the noble resolutionmwhich pervades her soul, she vows so to atone for her early error, so to redeem her fall by ex- alted acts of virtue, that even the orthodox Mrs. Singerly, tho stern mother of the man she loves, shall at last confess that she, Julia Witherson, is worthy to be her son's wife and her daughter. She vows so to expiate her error that at last even the prejudiced women of society shall confews in their own despite, that a woman may fall, and yet rise again; may be " erring, yet noble." Did she keep her vow? We will see. * *   * Of *   *t *      *   BOOK TH1 SECOND. ONWARD AND UPWARD. CHAPTER        I. ONE STEP. IN the earlier pat of the month of March, towards five o'clock in the afternoon, Julia Witherson was seated in her own apart- mert, alone, and in deep meditation. Her room was not large but most comfortable, furnished with every attention both to the useful and the beautiful, the utile et duice. Every convenience for a lady's toilet Was at hand; all that modern civilization can do for a woman in the way of dress- ing cases, well-filled wardrobes, aud the like, waited upon her convenience. One side of the room was covered with shelves loaded with books, volumes of reference, literary works and volumes of philosophy, betokening the intellectual tastes of the occupant. A cozy fire was burning in the grate, for the day had been raw, cold and blustering. And in an easy arm-chair sat Julia, little changedsince we sawnher last, saving that she is much paler, somewhat thinner, and more intellectual, though, alas sadder loolking. Her eyes, too, seem larger than their ment, neglected and careless. As she sat by the fire, with the dreary March evening closing around her, and heard the wind howling without, she sighed heavily, and then her musings found utterance. "Yes, though at first my pride rebelled, yet I have learned to acknowledge - a fis    y rd   88        E]RR1I, YrET NOBLE. that she, his mother, was right when she refused her consent to my marriage with her son. I have been taught humility; but yet the time'shall come when she shall not withhold her con- X sent, when I shall have so atoned that even she will confess her- self satisfied. Oh I for some plan by which I can work out this expiation-this atonement. But no matter, I will attain unto this idea some day. And Charles-Charles-my Charles, llow I love him still I He little guesses how, unseen myself, I ever watch his movements. I have striven to forget hn in vain; I have given my days and nights to study-to music; yet his image haunts me still. I have heard of his dissipa- tions, and of his brief but violent flirtations, and I understand but too well the cause both of the one and the other. -He loves me still, cannot forget me. Yes, he loves me truly--will love me forever-and I shall yet be fully worthy of his fullest love. It is hard thus to be punished; it is hard thus to be severed from a true passion just at the moment of fruition and repent- ance; but it is best -to bear a heavy burden ; all other loads will seem light in comparison. Oh God, for there must be a God somewhere, let me first be tried and purified by affliction, and then, oh then, let me know the full bliss of affection!" And in the excitement of the moment she raised her eyes up- ward, and outstretched her hands, as though striving to grasp palpably the rnercy of heaven. IBut her violent emotion was of transitory duration ; she grew calmer, and advanced to the book-shelves, to seek a momentary solace in reading. First she took down a copy of Byron, but his works were too morbid to give her relief. Then she sought refuge in liosseau; then rush- ed to some German savant with an unpronounceable namele, and at last stumbled upon a copy of an old book, very much ridiculed in certain quarters, but a great book notwithstanding. The most used, the most abused, the most wonderful, the most fear- ful, the most delicious, the most incomprehensible, and yet the most simlile of volumes, The Holy Bible. This was a book into which Julia had of late looked lore than formerly ; she had even begun to read it regularly, as a matter of curiosity and ; '    E              ERRING, YET NOBLE.         89 study.   Sle was not yet a "believer" in its doctrines; her only religion was the religion of "Nature,' and of an honorable heart (a very godd creed, but not sufficient) ; but she had now com- menced to doubt her'own doubts. She opened the volume, and glanced over it. She read a chapter in Genesis, some of the odd chapters in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, some of the histories of the Kings, etc., without finding special matter for thought; but, turning over the pages of the New Testament, she chanced to fall upon the instructive, lheart-touching story of the woman taken in adultery and brought unto the Saviour, and forgiven by him. Then, as she tined over the leaves, her eye cauglt that short, but most sweet and magnificent sentence, the finest, to our taste, in either ancient or modern literature,-"God is love." She put the Bible away; and the thought rushed over her mind-not for the first time-that a book so full of forgive- ness and affection, must be also full of truth and inspiration. And, as she sat in her lonely room, with no companionship save that of her own soualca voice seemed to say to her, as was said to Thomas in the olden time,--"Be iot doubting, but-believ- ing."            t A tap was heard at her room door; and a servant entering, informed our heroine that the Rev. George Howard had called, and -was awaiting her appearance in the paklor. In the meantime, while our heroine is dressing to receive her visitor, we will precede her to the parlor, and speak a few words concerning her clerical guest, whom we introduced to the reader in our last book, at the burning of the church of St. ---- He was a college-mate, and is a true, warm friend of Charles Singerly s, and though he has been acquainted with Miss With- erson for not many months, has, nevertheless, become warmly interested in her welfare in a friendly way, and has won a large portion of her esteem. The Rev. George Howard is a tall, fine-looking, intellectual young man, of powerful physique, with dark hair, shading a broad brow, deep, black eyes, dark complexion, a handsome moustache, and splendid teeth, and without the inevitable white   90         ERRING, YET NOBLE. cravat, which is supposed to be essential. In fact, Mr. Howard's appearance was far from clerical. He looked like a thoroughly aui fait man of the world. He did not believe that the tailor made either the man or the clergyman. A'nd as he had a tend- ency in his nature to fine clothes, he indulged his taste. He was a dandy, in short. Both in his outer and his inner man he differed greatly from the majority of priests. His parents being of high respectability and great wealth, Howard had been al- lowed every advantage, and had improved his opportunities. But his soul was of a higher and purer order than the average. From his earliest years he had been both " moral and religious ;" not a canting, prejudiced charlatan, but a wise, gentlemanly, ob- serving, sensible, practical; unpretending, large-hearted Christian; holy, but enlightened ; sinless, yet the friend of sinners. He had seen that." religion," so-called now-a-days, is a narrow, formal, unpractical and impracticable thing ; and had resolved to devote his life to an earnest endeavor to make religion something differ- ent and something better. He, therefore, in pursuance of his plan, first studied and observed the world of books and of men. He read law, medicine, divinity ; had been engaged awhile in business, in politics, in editorship, and in authorship; had trav- eled extensively, and had moved in all circles of society. He accomplished this part of his programme between the age of- eighteen and that of twenty-eight, and then devoted himself to the study of an erlectic religion, embracing the strong points of the various creeds, but omitting their errors. He then became an independent preacher; teaching a religion fitted for the world and its uses ; encouraging moderate and lawful pleasure, ambition, shrewdness, etc., etc. ; but, at the same time, a reli- gion of peace, opposed to sectarianism or to war ; a religion in short of good works, rather than good words or forms; of the heart, rather than habit; of honesty, practical profit, and univer- sal charity and brotherhood. Of course, many laughed at him ; many misunderstood him ; some reviled him (especially the clergymen of the various sects); and all wondered at him. But he cared not; and in course of   M jji}, ERRTINO% -YET NOBLE.                    91 time the masses of the community began to understand him and to like him--he became popular. One thing he never did. He never read theological works. Theology he considered, and rightly, as the foe of piety: His only religious book was his Bible, the plain simple Bible, with- out note or comment. One thing he always did: one-third of all he had, both of time and money, he gave freely and heartily to the poor. His was, indeed, true religion and true piety. Such was the Rev. George Howard, who was now awaiting the advent of Julia Witherson. Presently our heroine appeared, welcomed her friend warmly, and became engagred with him in conversation. One of the objects of Mr. Howard's present visit was to ascertain if possible the cause of the separation between Julia and his intimate friend, Charles-a separation which he had wondered at, regretted, but was totally inll the dark as to any reason for it. But on broaching the subject delicately he found Miss Witherson quite as uncommunicative as Charles, and, therefore, abandoned his idea for the present. Dinner was now announced, and Miss Witherson was escorted to the table by her visitor. After dinner, Mr. Howard and our heroine found themselves in sole and undisputed possession of the parlor ; fMrs. Russell was out of town ; her husband had a busi- ness engagement; and Julia received no general company. So the conversation between our parties had no check upon it, and soon became serious, touching upon the topic of religion, a sub- ject which M3r. Howard was ever glad to discuss, thoulgh averse to obtruding it. "Tell me, Mr. Howard, tell me what is true religion," asked our heroine. "Give me your idea of the religion of a good man." "It is very simple, MAiss Julia," replied the Rev. Howard. "It is not a system of forms or institutions. It is not a definite creed, a belief in certain dogmas. It is not the mere avoidance of certain vices; nor yet the mere practice of any individual virtue. No ; true religion is none of these. Forms and creeds are to true piety what dress is to the man ; useful, very elegant,    92        - LERRING, YET NOBLE. but-by no means the man himself. No ; real religion is an hon- est, practical belief in a good and just God-; in the weakness of man's nature, and his need of a Redeemer ; in a place of reward for the virtuous, and a place of punishment for the evil-doers; in a "next world" which will "set right" the present. And more than this, true religion consists in honesty, industry, pru- dence ; laudable ambition ; a sense of honor ; moderation ; true friendship; true love; fieedom from prejudice; large-llearted- ness and, above all, personal honor; nobility of soul true sympathy and philanthropy. Such, Miss Julia, is my idea of 'the religion of a good man."   - As Julia sat - and listened to such an exposition of religion, her soul expanded, and she felt that, were all creeds like his, she had never been an infidel. But then she remembered several harsh and mysterious texts she had encountered in her casual readings of the Bible, and the still more harsh and unnatural interpretations that celebrated so-called "t ommentators" and "divines" had fastened upon them. She found it difficult to rec- oncile such teachings as these with the noble doctrines enunmci- ated by the Reverend Howard. She mentioned this fact to him, but our clergyman readily disposed of these objections, showing that we cannot, being fallible, undertake to understand all por- tions of the infallible Scriptures ; that the Bible must be believed "in the lump," as it were, rather than piece-meal, the harsh and mysterious parts being forgotten in the sufficiency, for all practi- cal purposes, of the tender and plain passages ; and, lastly, that "commentators," as a class, were full of mistakes, and had done more harm than good in the religious world. "But what,' asked Julia,--and we can imagine how anxious- ly- " are our views as regards sin and sinners? Are there any Unpardonable sins? Can one who has erred, even to the very extent of error,- whether mau or woman--can he or she, in this world, atone for their fault, and become once more pure and spotless?" "Miss Witherson," answered the Reverend George Howard, slowly, solemnly and earnestly to this interrogatory, " as surely as   ;1  . ^ERRING. YET NOBLE.                  9 3 I believe there is a God, so surely do I believe that NO sin what- ever is unpardonable ; no crime but what can be repented of sin- cerely and truthfully, and be fully and forever forgiven. Nay, more-no sin, however great, whether it be in man or in woman, whether the world pardon it or not, whether society has mercy upon it or no, but can be in this world atoned for; not by fast- ings or prayers, or forms or creeds, but by the exercise of many extraordinary virtues in, the place of the one extraordinary error?" Such were the noble sentiments of the Rev. George Howard; sentiments infinitely above the averlage. Need we say what comfort they brought to the soul of Julia. Reader, is it any wonder, if in the course of time, Julia ceased to be a " skeptic," and became a believer in Christianity as thus interpreted? Her natural independence; her pride of mental power; her careless, Godless continental education-; and, more than all, her observation of the hypocrisies and incon- sistencies of Christians-these led her originally to skepticism ; but time, experience, self-knowledge, the humility taught her by her shame, further study, all these, and more than all these- the beauty, the glory, the peace of true Christianity, as inter- preted by true Christians of the George Howard school, brought her at last, with the blessing of Heaven, to Faith and Holy hope. Is not this, indeed, " a step onward and upward?"    "        ERRING, YET NOiBLE. CH AP T E R -I. ANOTHER STEP--A GRAND RESOLVE. ' WE have before stated that Julia had, in her own secret heart, made a vow so to ATONE for her early error, that even the mother of her lover should confess herself satisfied. How this atonement was to be carried out she as yet knew not. The idea had not suggested itself to her, as to the manner, the details of the expiation; but her soul brooded constantly and anxiously on the subject, ready to act upon the first grand, practical sug- gestion that should occur. One evening, when her meditations upon this theme were of more than usual earnestness, her uncle came to her, as she was sitting solitary in her chamber, and begged her to accompany his wife and self to pay a call upon a friend not many blocks distant. She accepted the invitation, glad of any distraction to her thoughts. It was about eight o'clock, and our trio took Broadway for a short distance on the way to their destination. This great thoroughfare was crowded-as noisy and as gay as ever-and Julia wondered as she saw the passing and re-passing multitude of men, how they all managed to "earn a living." But, alas, she also encountered many women, whose sunken yet painted cheeks, and whose bold, reckless wretchedness of de- meanor, left no doubt as to the question of their means of ob- taining a livelihood. True, Julia, in common with all women who live in this good town of New York, h,d often been com- pelled to behold women of this class many times before this; but to-night the sight of these wretches prodtuced a more than wonted effect upon her mind. Her soul sunkiith shame at this degradation of her sex. And suddenly the thought flashed through per mind: can- not some, at least, of these poor wretches be redeemed?               ERREING, YET NOBLE.       95 cannot I do something towards -redeeming them? This idea rushed upon and seized her mentally, as if by inspiration. -She accompanied her relatives, paid her call with them, per- formed mechanically all that was required, said mechanically all that was needed, returned home and, retired. But she moved, and talked, and felt like one in a trance; her self, her soul was possessed with the idea-cannot I do something towards the salvation of the outcasts of my own sex I The idea was a wild one, a very original and wild thought, Utopian perhaps, indelicate perhaps; but civilization often drives just such ideas as these into the heads of thinking people. 'True, " respectable" women arc supposed by the world to be utterly ignorant even of the existence of women who are not respectable; true, women of one class know little and care less (save occasionally in a vague, mysterious way of which they never dare to speak) of women of another class; true, even Julia herself had, until this very night, heeded little of these lepers of society, and bestowed upon them only an occasional shudder; but now a new interest in these poor creatures awoke in her mind and heart; and as time rolled on her interest in this subject deepened. One morning, on taking up the newspaper of the day, her eye fell upon a detailed account of the meeting of a Rosine association, on which occasion a report had been read giving full particu- lars of the amount of good achieved by the society during the past year, and stating it as the opinion of the committee that if more women of the respectable class would but devote themselves to the work of bringing back the unfortunate, an infinitely greater amount of good could be accomplished. The report concluded as follows: "Kindness and sympathy will be found effectual with the most degraded when harsh- ness and mere moral teachings have failed. Love and pity, as shown in the gentle voice and the warm grasp of the hand will do more to redeem than all ' the terrors of the law' enunciated in all the thunders of Mount Sinai."   96a.       ERRING, YET NOBLE. : These words, so full of truth that they deserve to be inscribed indelibly' upon the heart of every woman who cares for the true interests of her sex, produced a deep impression upon our heroine; their memory remained not only in her mind but in her soul. They were never forgotten. One Sunday afternoon, a delicious May Sunday, one of the sweet half-spring, half-summer days, which Heaven sometimes fends to bless the earth with, when even the crowded city seems to become transfigured, as it were, into something more lovely than a mere mass of heated bricks and mortar; when in the country the birds sing sweetly in the balmy air, and in the town people meet each other with a smile, and the children cry out in their glee "Summer's coming;" one May. Sunday afternoon, as Julia sat in her room, by the open window, half dreaming and half thinking, her aunt entered  the apartment and said, "Julie, for a wonder I think I will i attend service somewhere this afternoon. A walk will do me good. Will you go with me?" "With pleasure, aunt," replied our heroine.. Now, where shall we go? I propose St. S--'s."    i O1 Oh, that is too near. Why, it is not five minutes' dis. tance." ' "St. P.  's then."' "That is too far. We would not reach there till late,",  observed Julia.                      : "Where, then, shall we go?" said Mrs. Russell. "Oh, I  have it, Julia. Let us go to hear your friend Sir. How-  ard."   "Just the thing, aunt. I could have wished for nothing better."'  In due time they reached the church of which Mr. Howard I was at present pastor, and found a large congregation assembled; for Howard had become of late quite popular  1 as a bold, independent speaker, who " told his mind" on all subjects, and was not afraid of the truth in any of its thou- bands of shapes, or its tens of thousands of applications   EBRRING, YET NOBLE.        97. After the usual services, the clergyman announced as his text, "Let him that is without sin cast the first stone at her." Julia started. It was strange how this text chimed with her recent meditations. Howard proceeded to give a bold, plain-spoken, truth-telling sermon on the immorality of the age. "Immorality," said the orator (for he was an orator, and his eloquence was truth), " is the vice of the times. It pervades all classes of society, the rich and the poor, the married and the unmarried. It is the darling sin of the man of the world, and is not unknown to vehemently protesting and ardently professing Christians. Chastity is as rare as honesty; licentiolsness is as universal as extravagance. "And yet," the orator continued, " corrupt as society is, nothing will satisfy it but it must be hypocritical in addition,. The very men who betray are the first to desert. And the stained women of fashion are the very ones to loathe their poor wayward sisters of the streets. Yes, every woe a tear may claim, Except an erring sister's shame." The clergyman concluded his discourse as follows: "There is a large class of unfortunate women who can be redeemed. Yes, spite of the cant of the day, I tell you the great majo. rity of this class can be redeemed. Not by scorning them, as most of you do ; not by threatening them either with the law or the gospel, as some mistaken zealots do ; but by simply seeking them out in the spirit of love and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by a sister's heart within your own breast, finding- out the way to theirs. My word for it, one good woman with truth on her lips and love in her heart can win ten bad women back to the paths of virtue. "Oh that some one woman would but try the experiment- would but act upon our suggestion-she would be, indeed, the benefactress of her sex. All women would call her 'blessed.' She would deserve a monument; aye, she would have one; a monument of praise and heartfelt thanksgiving.  What. "    98         EBRRING, YET NOBLE. ever her own individual faults might be, the glory of this her goodness would overshatdow them' all.  For of her it could truly be said, ' Her sins (even though they be many) are forgiven her, for she loved much! '" The sermon was over ; the congregation was dismissed; the lovely May afternoon was drawing to its close. And Julia Witherson had at last found her atonement. She had at last found how to atone for evil by doing good. She felt as though the last words of the sermon she had just heard were directly intended by Leaven and the speaker for her and her only. Yes I she would atone for herself by the re- demption of others. This may seem a wild idea, a -Utopian scheme, an extravagant thought. But strange and noble people when they hear strange but glorious sentiments, such as those spokenr by the Rev. Howard, will adopt these sentiments, a ed construct upon them strange but noble courses of action. And thus with Julia such an idea as she now conceived, could never by any possibility have entered into the mind of most women. Yet it was to her perfectly natural, under the circumstances. Nothing noble is unnatural to a noble mind, under noble excite. ment. Her mind was made up. She returned home with her heart and soul full of the idea. And that night, just as midnight swept over the city, with its wings laden with women's sighs and with women's sins, with wicked revels and with evil deeds, while "The cold, round moon shone deeply down. "  *  *  *  . blue the sky Spread like an ocean hung on high, Bespangled with those isles of light; So wildly, spiritually bright." At this solemn hour stood Julia at the window of her cham- ber, gazing into the blue infinitude of space, studded with its stars, and seeking mentally, as it were, to pierce the veil that hid from her sight Him, the all-good and the all-merciful, Him who heareth and recordeth vows. For in the depths of her   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         99 heart a vow wOs I]ow" being uttered; a vow as solemn as was ever made on earth, or registered in heaven-a vow that con- cerned perchance the everlasting welfare of many another wo- man. For our heroine determined henceforth to devote herself to the rescue of the unfortunate, the redemption of the depraved of her own sex. She fell upon her knees and prayed for strength-for blessing. The blessing that she asked was that by this means she should be enabled to atone for her oywn fatal error; to win at least the approval of her upon whose consent depended the happy love of him, the man who was her earthly all. And the moon shone on, and the stars twinled, and neither earth nor heaven gave a sign--but who can doubt but that she was heard-aye, and answered, too? For when she arose from her knees, theire was a smile upon her lips, and in her hearnt that ,' peace of God which passeth understanding."    100        liRRINXG, YET NO BLE. CHAPTER III. A WOMAN SAVED. GOOD resolves are comparatively easy; but it is a difficult matter to leave glowing generalities, and to descend to necessary but very disagreeable details. The resolve of Julia., spoken of in our last, was most noble. But soon the question arose--"How can I best realize my idea?' This question was more readily asked than answered. Remember her position. A young, unmarried woman, with a large and fashionable acquaintance; how could she mix, as mix she must, with the lowest class of females without being noticed and severely criticised? It was a matter in which she could scarcely have confidants, either male or female. She could join no organized associations--they did not fully answer her designs. And, consequently, she found that her good work would have to be done in secret, by her own unaided, individual exertions. She had, of course, but little information as to any data regarding the subject on which to base her plans; the condition of the heathen being a matter on which most " respectable women ' are as well informed as they are concerning the details and habits of women who are not " respectable."  But knowledge on this sub- ject must be procured, and procured through her own efforts alone. One afternoon in June, Miss Wvitherson proceeded down Broadway to make some purchases for herself, her aunt, and even her aunt's servants; for our heroine, full of true, had no false pride, and was always kind to and thoughtful of her infe- riors. Though plain and tasteful, yet Julia's attire was costly, even extravagant (for our heroine was lavish in her attire, as in her expenditure), and attracted much notice from the gentlemen,   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         101 while it excited no little envy in the bosoms of the lady pedes- trians. Havingr made her purchases (by-the-by, she was not an ' expert " at " shopping, ;" she was but a poor hand at barrgain- ing, and always paid " two prices" for everythllin she bought), our heroine strolled along our great thoroughfare for some dis- tance, enjoying the beauty of the afternoon, which was balmy and delightful. Feeling at last somewhat wearied, she entered one of our fashionable saloons (more for rest than refreshment) and gave a trifling order. While waiting, a gentleman, who had been seated at a table close by, arose,' and Julia recognized him as a Mr. Theodore Watson, with whom she was slightly acquainted. As Julia returned the salute of this gentleman, she noticed that, as he pulled out his handkerchief, a letter fell from his pocket to the-floor. She called to him to direct his atten-' tion to the fact ; but he had already neared the door of the saloon. "I will keep it for him till I see himll agaia ; it may be of importance." So thinking, Julia advanced and picked up the letter. It had no envelope, and she could not help recognizing the handwriting ; it was familiar to her-alas, too familiar; it was that of Henry Hericot.- She gave a start as she recognized it, and once more glancing at the note mechanically, her eye fell upon these words,-"There Mary and I will hate a supper, wines, etc. I shall use all my accomplishments ; force, if neces- sary." She started again, and more violently. These words had, to her mind, knowing the writer as she did, a fearful sig- nificance. They referred, her instinct told her, to some new crime about to be perpetrated by Hericot. Would that she could but read the letter and learn further particulars ; perhaps she might then be able to prevent it. Why should she not read the letter? True, it was designed for another; but the safety of the victim, the Mary referred to, should not be sacri- ficed to a scruple. Providence bad so ordered it that the means for detecting villainy were placed now in her hands. Should she not use them? Should she not read? After 'a brief but severe mental struggle, she determined "yes," and read as fol- lows    D"DEAR THEODORE-I will not be able to join you on the night of which you speak. I have just niade an appointment  for that evening with a most delicious creature--a shop girl up- town, who is called Alalry Barton, the most unsophisticated of mortals. She thinks my name to be Charles Crosby (mny ' trav- eling name,' you know,) and that I am 'serious.' Her parents are  dead. She is boarding, and I am her first acquaintance. I  a, 1  happy dog, am I not? My plan is to take her, at eight oclock-, Wedlesday evening, to a convenient friend of mine, who lives in St., No.-. There Mary and I will have a supper wines, etc. I shall use all myv accomplishments-and force, if necessary,-- so that Wednesday night will be somewhat of an epoch. But on Thursday, I will meet you at the Club, if I do not happen to encounter you previously. Yours, etc., HENRY ITERICOT." On reading this letter, the first thoulght that presented itself  to our heroine's mind was, that here lay the colmmencement of ber career as a -redeemer of her sex; here was her first opDor- ;unity to save a woman ; here was a woman, Mary Barton, to )e saved ;  and Julia's soul was at once determined to avail tself of the opportunity. Mary Barton, then, should be rescued. 3ut how? It was now five o'clock in the afternoon of the verly Vednesday mentioned in the villainous letter-within three ours of the time appointed. She knew not Mary Bar1ton ; the tter specified not her abode ; it. only mentioned the place of teeting.  To this place thel, at eig-ht o'clock that very evening ;e must go--and go alone ;  for both her uncle and the Rev. r. Howard, the only two-persons to whom she could apply, ere, she knew, both out of town. A  momentary thought of' ie police entered her mind; but no, she would go herself, id go alone. A  certain amount of natural fear and prudence  ruggled within her; but her pride-her self-confidence-a cer-  in love of adventure (which had always been a feature in her  aracter) ;  her courage (beyond the average of her sex) ; her   th in her cause and intentions, and in the protection of Heav.    en; a desire to foil the man-l who had once foiled and betrayed her; these overcame her scruples, and determined her in her course. She instantly went to her guardian's residence; left word there that she would not be at home till late, intending to visit a mutual friend of the family a few doors distant. She then call- ed upon this friend and remained till seven o'clock. Then con- trolling her agitation as best she, might, and refusing, an escort, "as the distance home," she said, " was so trifling,' she hastily wended her way, agitated but not daunted, avoiding the leading streets, and hiding her features as much as possible, to the house of the ' convenient friend" mentioned in the letter of Hericot, which letter, by the by, she carried with her. On reaching the house in St----, No-, having hastily determined upon her plan of action, she advanced and rang the bel. In a few moments an old woman answered the summons, peering around cautiously, and asking, '"Who is there?1' "My- name is Mary Barton," was the reply "Mr. Crosby told me to call 1here. He was not able to come with me, but will be here shortly.  He told me I was to wait here till he Carme. Our heroine had given Hericot's assumed name to the woman, onauventure-it proved to be a successful one. For though the old woman seemed somewhat surprised at the change of pro- gramme, (for she expected that Her:icot and Mary Barton- would arrive together,) 'nd had expected  to find a more timid, unsophisticated girl than the one before- her; yet our heroine's assurance succeeded, as assurance generally does. She was admitted and shown into a plaillly  furnished parlor, and was then left alone. In the course of some twenty minutes, (which seemed like so many hours to our heroine, who, bold as she was, felt the peculiarity of her position, and was several times upon the very point of retiring from her undertaking), another ring was heard at the door. The old woman a;gain an- swered this summons, but was astonished at beholding Mr. Hericot in company with a second woman, who was, of course,   104        ERRING, YET NOBLE. this time, the genuine Mary Barton. The new comners were admitted, however ; then Hericot, being told of the presence of a third party, who had assumed the name of his companion, rushed into the parlor, and beheld the person whom of al] liv- ing beings upon the face of the earth, he now least-expected or desired to see, his former victim, his present conqueror, Julia Witherson. It would require a skilful painter of human emotions to do full justice to the position now presented. The fear and wonder of the woman of the house ; the astonishment of Mary Barton (a pretty, delicate-looking, curly-haired, slender girl of the blonde& order); the mingled sensations of Henry Hericot, as expressed by his eye and his changes of countenance, wonder, fear, rage and utter vexation at the unlooked-for presence ; and lastly, the contempt, triumph, and joy depicted upon Julia's glorious face, all these to be described must have beeneseen. The room had naught remarkable about it; the furniture was plain, the pictures were few ; and yet, no gorgeous scene upon any stage ever presented a more truly dramatic tableau. Julia was the first to speak. Turning to Hericot, she said : "I know all. Your intended treachery to this poor girl is revealed to me."  Then, seeing his start of astonishment, she continued : "The explanation is very simple-this letter of yours. Your correspondents should be more careful of such valuable documents (showing the letter). I have come here to prevent your design-and I will prevent it." Then turning to the astonished AMary Barton, she read the letter to her, spite of an effort of Hericot's to wrest it from her. "-My poor, innocent girl, you see to what a danger and to what a villain you have unwittingly exposed yourself. This man here, who boasts that you regard him as your suitor, takes Advantage of your innocence, your ignorance of the world, your lonely, motherless condition, of all tha  should render you sacred; takes advantage of all these things, for the basest of purposes. He would make you as vile and as wretched as ho'   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         105 has made many another woman, and would then leave you with- out remorse. And, brave knight and valiant gentleman that he is '--here the speaker's voice assumed a bitter, sarcastic tone, totally indescribable--" this man is prepared to use force, if lying fails. But, thank God, I am here as your preserver." "A fine preserver of others you are truly," cried Hericot, in desperation, ' you who have lost " But he proceeded no further in his retort. He saw a flush pass over Julia's face; he saw her eyes dilate and sparkle with a dangerous fire ; he saw her magnificent form grandly expand, as it were, with indignation ; he saw her hands clinch ; and a cow- srd's fear came over his coward's heart and stilled his coward's lips before the last damningr words of his retort, the full meaning of which was never known to the other parties, were spolken. He contented himself, therefore, with approaching Julia, and hissingly whispered in her ear : * "Have a care, have a care ; you are in my power. Let the secret I hold concerning you be revealed, and your condition would be worse than that of -the woman whom you would 'save,' as you style it. Take heed, lest I turn tattler, as you have turned intermeddler." "You dare not turn 'tattler.  You have the meanness to do so, but not the courage. You would thereby lose the purse of your friend Clarles Singerly. Ah-ha I I, too, have you. in my power. Betr Ay my secret if you dare, and reconcile yourself, if you can, to loss of friend and money, which to you is more than either life or honor." Such was Julian's expressive and sufficient reply to the empty threat of Hericot. Then turning to IMary Barton, our heroine addressed her: "Miss Barton, /lary, let me call you, for my heart warms towards you-you see this letter which I hand you; you see that man's tell-tale face; you mark yonder vile woman ; yoa behold my face, which must speak its truth and its kindness; can you doubt of the snare that has been laid to entrap you?" . Mary looked around her.- She bhad recognized the hand-   106        IRBING, YET NOBLE. writing of the letter, she read it eagerly yet loathingly; she saw the confusion of her false lover ; she marked with disgust the countenance of the old woman; she could not doubt the perfect truth and love which looked from Julias -eyes ; she fell upon our heroine's neck, and burst into tears, as she exclaimed: "' I am saved, and you have saved me." It was a touching sight. Tjhe proud, stately brunette, Julia, with her large eyes and long dark rich-hair, embraced, clung to by the timid, curly-haired, fair-skinned 1Mary Bar- ton-sisters in the holy bond of preserver and preserved, which now united them, though until this hour utter strangers to each other 1 "Come with me, Mary," said Julia, tenderly, " come with me; your beauty shall find a companion, and your innocence a protector."  "Oh yes, let us go," was the reply, " let us: leave this hor- rible -place-- these fearful -people who can plan such frightful plots against a poor girl. And yet, I did think that tnat man loved me." And a tear forced itself into Mary's blue eye as she sighed over her vanished dream of love. "I thought so, too, once," muttered Julia, bitterly, to her- self, and then raising her head proudly she said to Hericot, "We leave you to your conscience." Then turning to the old woman she simply, sternly said, "Open your door that. we may pass out." Hericot would fiave murdered Julia on the spot had he dared. Thoughts of resisting their departure rushed through his mind, but he knew our heroine's courage, her resources, her will ; he felt that he was actingl a villainous, and, there- fore, a weak part; he knew not what aid milght be at hand; and he was personally a coward. With curses on his lips, and still more fearful curses unuttered in his soul, he beckoned to his comrade in iniquity, who opened the street door, and the two young girls departed from the house.   ERRING^ YET NOBLE.        107 loonlight, a lovely, fine moonlight was flooding the streets as our two girls wended their way, at every step leaving further behind them the scene of their recent danger and victory. Passing through the minor streets, and avoiding the crowded thoroughfares, and hiding thei/countenances as much as possible, they reached at last, without any adven tiire or recognition, the "l up town" boarding house whe!rein Mf ary Barton resided.. For Julia had determined that it was best that her newly-found friieind should return for the night to her accustomned quarters, xwhere our heroine would call upon her in the morninT, with her plans for the future more fully arranged. Julia's kindness emnbraced not only the sav- ing of'Mary Barton fi'om ome peril merely, but from all expo- sure to future dangers. At the door of the boarding house the two girls, so strangely met, parted from each other; Mary Barton, who, every moment, felt nlore vividly the hor- rors from which she had been rescued, putting her arm affec- tionately, gratefully, yet most respectfully around our hero- ine's neck, and kissing her iervently. In that kiss- there was more gratitude expressed than those same beautiful lips could have ever spoken. And in that kiss Julia enjoyed her exceeding- great r eward. It is midnight, and in his club-room Hericot is regaling his companions with an account of his numerous triumphs over women. He speaks with the air of a great conqueror, a second Csesar. Has he forgotten his disgrlaceful discomfi- ture-not three hours ago? :Not by any means. And he has determined upon revenge? But he is a capital actor, and a capital liar. It is midnight, and while Hericot sits in his club-room lying, Julia sits by her bedroom window thinking. The same moon which in May shone on her as she made her vow, now shines on her in June when, she has taken her first step in its fulfillment. She kneels downdin the moonlight and thanks God. Her agitation has subsided; the reaction which super, iY   108 OERRING, YET NOBLE. vened upon tne excitement she has undergone has passed away, everything is forgotten save that Heaven has blessed her efforts, that she has taken one step further in atonement, in expiation; that she has become more worthy of Heaven's forgiveness, of Charles' love, and of his mother's smiles. But Julia is not selfish; and, above all other things, does she thank God upon her knees, at her bedroom 'window, with her large eyes and glorious face upturned to the Infinite One, whose throne is beyond the stars that through his blessing up on her effort s a soul had  been preserved--a woman has been saved!               ERRING, YET NOBLE.       103 CHAPTER IV. AN ASSISTANT IS PROCURED. TnE next day Julia called upon Mary Barton, and sug- gesied that she should abandon her situation in the store, and live with our heroine as her " companion." Mary gladly consented; and as Julia's guardian and his wife, to whom she had .mentioned in a general way that she needed "a companion," were willing to gratify their ward, the matter was arranged. Julia,- though her heart had been taught suspicion by ex- perience, nevertheless soon learned not only to like but to love Mary Barton; she was so grateful, so loving, yet so full of true respect.  She never was weary of thanking our heroine for the service she had rendered her-a service which she appreciated at its true value. For thoughtless, igno- rant of the world, unsophisticated as she had once been, she -was so no longer. But no woman that ever lived- prized more highly the boon, the priceless boon of honor. One day Mary was more than usually eloquentk upon her theme. "Oh, Miss Julia," she said, "' how I shudder often at nights when I think from what a horrible fate you rescued me. Many a poor girl in this city (for I have learned lately thlat there are such women) would not have lived the way sho lives now,- had a bold, true, angel-friend like you been near  her in her hour of trial. Oh, Miss Julia, do you know I think that but for you I might have been forced to be just such a girl as one of these poor creatures I I Perhaps you think it strange and wrong in me, Miss Julia, to think on such mat- ters, but I have asked myself (I am a silly thing I know), cannot something be done by good women, women like you, for these poor, lost, bad women? I do pity them so. Perhaps I ought to hate them, but I cannot, I only pity them." *   "O        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Julia was now seized with a sudden impulse, to expllain which we must digress a momIent. *In her plani for the redemption of her sec, that plan which was day and night nearest to her soul and- to her heart1, Julia - felt that she needed a female confidant-a female assistant. Yet in such a scheme it seemed to her impossible, as before remarked, to procure one. Whien sle wnas tilrown into contact with Mary Barton, the idea had occasionally flitted through Julia's brain that possibly her new "companion " mig'ht answer her purposes. But Mary's seeming worldly ignorance and weakness of mind thwarted her purpose. But Julial had of late discovered that her companion was neither so weak-minded nor so worldly- ignorant as she had at first imagined ; and now. to-day she also discovered that her new frienld had thought upon the very sub- ject that most occupied her own mind. So, actuated by a sudden impulse, she replied to the words of her companion, just recorded. "You are right, Mary. We women oulght to pity and not to hate the unfortunates of our own sex. And we two, yes, even we two, can do much to save them.- I have something to tell you of, Mary ; something in which you can aid me greatly. Shall I tell you? Will you aid me?" "Oh, Miss Julia," replied A1ary, " why ask me such questions? Of course, I will do all that you can ask of me." "Then I will tell you a secret, MBIary. I will tell you, of a very strange resolve I miade recently. A good man, the Rev. George Howard, of whom you have heard me speak, once said in a sermon, which I heard, th:lt a wonman could, by kindness and ' love and personafl exertion, restore t he unfortunates of hler sex. These words haunted me, and, at last, I determined to act upol his sugrgestion. Mary, I have determined, strange and evell foolish as it may seem, to devote my time and energies- to thle restoration of poor women, lilke those of whom you just spoke. Something tells me that you wiil aid in this scheme; you wiil help nle in this work of salvation, will you not? Your words, just uttered, make me think that you Zoill. Aim I not rigirt?"

CHAPTER V. A VISIT TO A VICTIM. IN one of the minor streets of New York, a street which runs in the central portion of our city, near one of our principal tho- roughfares, stands a row of houses, in their outward appearance plain and unpretending. It is to the interior of one house in this row to which we invite our readers to accompany us in imagina- tion. The entry is narrow and dark, but the parlors are of a fair size, and well furnished. Though it is nearly noon, the win. dows of the parlor are almost entirely closed; still sufficient light from without penetrates to show us that the walls are elaborately papered, and are decorated with a number of fine prints and paintings of more than average merit. At each end of the room stands a large and expensive mirror. Tho apartment is well supplied with sofas, chairs and lounges, and an elaborately carved piano completes the array. In short, all the appointments of the parlor, carpet, window-curtains, and other etceteras included, are certainly comfortable, and seemi ngly re- spectable. ' A colored woman is employed in the usual feminine morning occupation of "putting things to rights.'  While she is thus engaged, a ring is heard at the front-door bell. The old negro woman, for she is both old and ugly, and wicked looking to boot, cautiously answers the summons, and opens the street door, which has a; sort of grating attached to it, opening from the inside. Two young women, dressed in the usual garb of females of the humbler class, shop-girls probably, are found standing on the steps, and desiring admission " to see Fanny Walters." The old negress, wondering at the object of tho E                                    .     .   ERRING  YET  OBLE.          " visitors (fo r people do'not generally call at the house in the morning, nor are the callers often of the female sex) ,replies that " Miss Walters is not up yet." On  being told, hower, by the young girls that they wish to see her particularly, she requests them to wait while she goes to deliver their message. She returns shortly, tells the young girls that she was mistaken, that Miss Fanny is ': up" for the day, and desires them to walk up  stairs to her apartment. They comply with the request, though there seems to be a strange nervousness and even timidity about them, as though they were penetrating into some dange r- ous  or, at least, unknown locality--as if they ere engaged  upon some unusual and  unfamiliar errand. They, however, fol- low the old negress , who conducts them up -a figlt of stairs, opens the door of an apartment bn the second floor, and thus brings them into the presence of Miss Fanny Walters. Looking than the parlors which we have already seen . The room is of considerable size, with an elaborately-flowered carpet, a large, elegant bureau, dressingcase and wash-stand. The walls are beautifully papered, and various Laudsome prints adorn them; the subjects of these being. serinly mythlological, representing the loves of the gods. They are free from positive vulgarity or indecency, but are ather highly colored-- hardly the proper sort of thing to ornament a young lady's chamber. Various articles of bijou and nicknacks are scattered over the room, and one or two books lie upon the table. And upon the bureau and on the mantlepiece lie several daguerreotypes. -On the mantlepiece also stands a clock of fanciful workmanship, the hands of which are now pointing to the hour of noon. Strange thasot a respectable young woman should be just rising from bed at noon-day!  A half-open closet reveals a large assortment of dresses and all varieties of female apparel. And on the table an empty wine bottle and some gilasses prove that the occupant of this apartment has at least luxurious tastes, to say nothing more ith In this room, clad in a hastily-donned poorning wrapper, with   "4        ERRIiNG, YET pITOBLE. her hair and person generally en dishaille, stands Fanny Wal ters. She is a brunette, of a very dark hue of complexion, well built, of the average height, and very handsome. Her hair is long, dark, and rich ; she is evidently proud of it, and with just cause. Her eyes are deep black, quick, restless, fiery, expressive- indicative of a restless, fiery, passionate soul. Her mouth is al- most perfect, so small, so exquisitely shaped, so temptingly deli- cious.  Her hands are nearly as perfect as her mouth, and fairly sparkle with rings.  Her feet are as beautiful as these most charming appendages of a pretty woman can be.  Her form is fill and luxuriant in its outlines, which, in her present dishabille, are plainly visible. Her neck and bust are splendid. She is, in short, a glorious creature. A woman full of passionate beau- ty and passionate life, full of witchery and enchantment; a creature for whom, if pure, a man might worthily live and die; a creature who, if worldly, debased, degraded, would be capable ofluriug a manl to eternal destruction. She stands in the centre of the apartment, and casts a glance at her visitors. She had evidently been expecting callers, but these are not they. As she makes this discovery, her glance becomes wondering, cold, suspicious, distrustful. She is, alas! not accustomed to visits from the virtuous of her own sex, and the two young girls who stand before her are evidently not of her own class.  She is well skilled in reading countenances, and she sees all this at once. What, then, can these two women want with her?   One of her visitors is a queenly-looking crea- ture, spite her-common garb, which does not seem somehow to belong to her. Tile other is a prettyi gentle young girl, evidently inferior to her companion. Now,- rdader, to save you all trouble we will simply inform you that the house we are nowr in is evil, that Fanny Walters is its inmate, and that her two  disguised visitors are simply Miss Julia Witherson  and  lIary Barton, bound upon their self-imposed mission of love and redemption. Fanny Walters turns to her visitors and' asks: "What do you want with me?  The servant told me two young women wished to see me; and as I   expected such about   ERRTNO, YET NOBLE.         115 this time,' I told her to send you up. But you are' not those I expected. W'hat do you want with me?" Now, reader, there are two ways of doing all things--the gradual way and the immediate method. Do you understand me? There are two ways also of reforming people-the slow, step-by-step plan (such as our heroine herself experienced), and the sudden, all-at-once method, as it w vere, which Providence sometimes adopts. The latter was the one which Julia, on this occasion, employed toward Fanny Walters. She merely replied to the question "What do you want with me?" by a look of tender pity, of holy compassion, and by the simple words, "I want to save you." You can imagine the surprise that such an answer as this would cause under such circumstances to such a person as Fanny Walters, who asked, in utter astonisliment: "What do you mean?   From what would you save me? What do you know of me?"' "Vry little,"' replied Julia, " and vet too much--by far, too much. I have seen you on the street the last few days. Your dress, and manner, and bearing, the attention you excited, the averted looks of women, the bold looks of men--the m6n who joined you, were not these sufficient to tell one who was on the watch what and who you were? lUnseen we followed you--awe traced you here. You dropped this card with your naime writ- ten upon it; we picked it up-we have come to save you." "How did it concern you who or what I may be? Again I say, what do you want witlh me?" Fanny had an exquisite voice; but now it sounded harshy and proudly-very differently from the syren tone with which she was wont to charm her adorers. But Julia's voice sounded like an angel's as she replied, earnestly, almost passionately: "I want to save you from yourself-to save you from this life which you are leading, and from its certain consequence-- destruction. Nay, you must hear me. You 'are sinning against God-that God whom you know exists. And your immortal soul will have to answer to Him at the last. Your life is a life   "6        ERRING, YET NOBLE. of shame. NNay, be as proud as you will, yet your life zs shameful. All the decent and respectable of your own sex ig- nore you. All honorable men despise or s]hun you. But I pity you, I lore you. You cannot be happy. You may paint, and you may dress ; you may laugh, and you may sing; but your heart, alas I is wretched, and you know it. You cannot cheat yourself, though you may deceive the world. When you are alone, you are most miserable. You dare not think upon the past, nor yet upon the'future. Your whole existence is merely one mocking, restless, noisy, worthless, wretched present. You are fit for better things. You are young and beautiful-made to be the light and centre of some pure and happy home. And you may be happy yet. -Do not doubt it. You know me not, but as sure as there is a God in Heaven, I am your true friend. I am not what I seem. I have what influences the world-po- sition, money. Abandon your present career, and trust to me. I will procure you a respectable, virtuous occupation; none shall ever know of your past life ; you will be honest, happy, prosperous; you will be worthy of yourself. I have faith in you. Such a being cannot be utterly lost. I have known of others, alas! some not far distant, who halve fallen as low, and yet have risen. You may yet be the honored, happy wife of some good man-who knows? Time, and penitence, and reform will purify you, and your early sin will be forgiven you--by God, at least, if not by man also. Believe me, there are many women like me in this world--women who are devoting themselves, for the sake of virtue, Heaven, and their own sex, to the welfare of their erring sisters. Listen to me, Fanny, dear Fanny-for so let me call you--listen to and be guided by me. Leave this vile place, and come with me. Come, as you dread future pov- erty, shame, the hospital, the almshouse, a pauper's burial, and a sinner's judgment. Come, for memory's sake, the memory of your childhood, of the days when you were pure. Come, for your sister's sake, if you have a sister. Come, for your mother's sake, come." Julia speaks solemnly, tenderly, earnestly. She throws   EeKIrNG, YlT NOBLE. .     11?  her very soul into her every word; she is in the might of her cause, resistless; she seems a being inspired; she looks as grandly beautiful as any prophetess of the ancient oracles. Could an artist sketch her now as she stands, like a goddess in that room of iniquity, her eye full of a heavenly fire, tem- pered with a Christ-like gentleness, his fortune were forever assured. And Fanny   stands beside her, with her dark expressive face, showing, in the restless workings of its lineaments the agitation of her soul. During the passionate address to which she has just listened, and which she has several times vainly endeavored to interrupt, her eye has now flashed defiance, and anon her lip has expressed an eloquent scorn. Then her form  has towered in pride, then her features have been full of wonder, then they have grown thoughtful; and then it seemed as though a sudden deter- mination was f)rmred, and as rapidly, alas I abandoned. But whien, at the last, one allusion is made to her childhood, her sister and her mother, "the woman" bursts forth, then tears fill her beautiful/ eyes; and angels in Heaven rejoice, for the sinner weeps. But her tears soon dry, her countel-. ance changes; the habits and feelings of years are generally proof against sudden impulses or emotions. She is herself, her old despa, despairing , despate, siuful- self once more; and her voice, thoullh no longer harsh, sounds, as it were, hopeless, as she says: "You have touched me. Few, none for years, have spoken to me as you have spoken. I cannot understand you or your motives, but I do understand what you have said. It is very true, I suppose, I know, but it is too late to mend in this world. Thank God my niother is dead." (There is a desperate sad- ess, yet a fondness in these words which defies descriptionD. "She knows not whather child has become. My sister, too, is safe. She will never be what I am. But it is too late for meo to repent or to reform. I hate my present life, and yet it is the only one that I can ever lead. See what a thing I am I You, even you, who profess to care for my welfare, even   "8   .    BEBMYINo, YET NOBLE. you have to disguise yourself and visit me by stealth. N'o, no, I must be hopeless, but gay, too. Oh, very gay. ' Re- pentance,' ' atonement,' 'honesty,' ' virtue,' love,' what are these to?Be but empty words? Names of impossible and uses less things. A short life and a merry one." (Gods I the tone in which she utters these words is sufficient to make one's flesh creep with horror.) "And no almshouse or hospital for me. When I think I have lived long enough, why, poiso?z is cheap, and New tYork has two rivers! You see I have all my plans laid. I tell you it is too late to change them, I say it is- too late." She fairly hisses the last words. "Oh, for your soul's sake, for vour /dead mother's sake," cries Julia, " do not talk so. It is never too late. While there is life there is hope. While a woman has breath she can repent and be forgiven. Listen." Seating herself by the window, Julia takes from her pocket a small Bible-a book which has, of late, been'her constant companion. She opens the sacred volume,- reads the story of the penitenti thief upon the cross, the story of the. woman taken in adultery, and then the exquisite parable of the Prodigal-Son ; thus showing from holy writ that truly it is never too late for the penitent sinner, and that the repent- ant wanderer-man or woman-has only to return to be for- given! It is a scene, once witnessed, never to be forgotten. There ,in that house-there in that room-there by the window-- sits the once doubting and erring Julia, reading the Scripture of Christ to one who is, indeed, in need of a Redeemer. The sunlight falls upon the reader's head like the blessing of Hea- ven, or as though it were a smile from the spirit-lips of Fanny Walters' dead mother; a dead mother rejoicing over the prospect of Iher living, erring child's salvation. In the centre of the apartment stands the lovely sinner, Fanny her- self, -listening to the lunfamiliar words of God. Her magni. ficent breast heaving wildly, her magnificent eyes full of the heart's emotions, while in the back-ground stands the gentle)   ERRINO, 'YET NOBL7E.        19 wondering, loving, pitying, hoping, pretty Mary Barton: whose experience has never paralleled an interview like this. And then the room itself, filled with every sign of artificial riotous life, while through the window comes aiglimpse of a bright summer sky, and from the outside is heard occasion. ally the song of a bird whose cage is suspended from the casement. As Fanny Walters listens to the old and once familiar Bible stories, her heart goes back to the Sunday-school and villahe church of her early-days, and a fierce struggle takes place in her inmost soul-a struggle which shall decide her destiny-a contest between the evil and the good, the God and the Demon within her. But her strong, passionate nature, the habits of her present life, and, above all, her- creed of fatalism and despair, her belief that-" it is too late," prove too powerful for the good angels that hlave come to her rescue ; and she suddenly bursts forth, exclairing: "No more of this, no more of this, I tell you. Once for all, it is too late; besides, I must have one thirg before I die. I will have it." "And what is this one thing?' asks the disheartened Julia. "My revenge" is the unchristian but passionate reply; "my revenge upon the man whom I once loved-who said that he loved me'the man who has made me what I am now and ever must be." And as she utters these words her form dilates, her. eyes flash, her dark face seems on fire, she clenches her beautiful hands, and then she continues, hur- riedly, excitedly-"Listen: I was born in the country. Iy mother died when I was but a mere child, leaving me and a little sister to the charge of my father, a rich farmer. We resided near a lake, near, also, to a pleasant little village. For several years I was perfectly happy, and won the love of the only son of the clergyman of the village. He was not rich, but my father liked him and had money enough for us both. My lover was reserved, studious, undemonstrative, but he loved me truly. I knew, I felt'it. Oh, my God, how   120        EKRING, YET NOBLE. happy we might have been I But in an evil hour a stranger came one summer to our quiet neighllborhood. He stayed a day or two at the village tavern, but my hospitable old father met him, took a fancy to his handsome face, for he was hand- some. I, too, met him. He fascinated me irresistibly. I knew not why or how, but that man soon became master of my whole soul. My true, faithful lover, the man to whom I was engaged, was forgotten in my madness. The stranger prolonged his stay; the fishing, he said, was so much finer than he had expected. My father and my lover suspected nothing. One afternoon we, this stranger and I, took a sail upon the lake. He told me he loved me; and I, the be- :trothed of another, listened, and confessed a mutual passion. He professed honorable intentions, but asked me to conceal our secret from all parties. Several times le attempted my ruin, but it was in moments of passion, and so infatuated was I that I forgave him, as in eloquent words, after each offence, he plead for pardon. But one evening we took a long ride together. He drove me to a lonely part of the country., r We took supper at a Wayside inn. He kenaw its character. I did not. I suppose the wine he ordered must have been drugged, the coward, for I remember nothing saving that in a few hours I found myself forever lost. In my rage I could have slain him and myself; but he pacified me with excuses, protestations of honorable designs, love and marriag-e. IWe returned late at night to my anxious father, gave the pretext of having lost the road, &c.; and the next day my betrayer gave me the slip, and left the neighborhood. Maddened, scarcely knowing what I did, I revealed my shame. My father cursed me, and I left home" (what an indescribable accent. of agony she gave to that familiar word) " forever. My father lost his mind and then his property, and then died. My poor lover still lives, but has never smiled since, and my little sister suddenly disappeared. I came to New York, and have been for years what I now am. But I shall yet be revenged. I am on his track. The name I knew him by   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        121 was assumed; but I have ascertained that he lives in this city; and by all that is sacred or devilish he shall die in this ilry yet, and by this 'hand. I have sworn it. He has murdered me; aye, murdered, me, as much as if he had stabbed me to the heart; and he shall die, and by this hand. Something tells me I shall live to find him yet. Oh God! how I did love that man once. W:as he not handsome?" So saying, she points to a daguerreotype lying upon the table. Julia glances at it, and her heart beats strongly with a strange presentment. The glance confirms her thought. Reader, it is the likeness of Henry Hericot. Yes, the be- trayer of Julia-the would-be seducer of Mary Barton-is the man who is responsible to earth and to Heaven for the ruin, body and soul, of Fanny Walters. But the excited Fanny who, overpowered with her emotions, now hid her face in her hands a moment, does not witness the sen- sations of her companion at beholding the daguerreotype of their betrayer, else -a suspicion might have been excited, a clue might have been given to Fanny, as to the personality and locality of her seducer, which she might have followed literally "to the death." But Julia's emotion at her new discovery soon subsided. And then she renewed with redoubled earnestness, her appeals to her " erring sister," to abandon her present life. Julia said not a word concerning Fanny's plan of ven- geance. Now is not the time for reproof or persuasion on this subject. The great point now to be obtained is to lead her first to another and better sphere of existence; all else is to be gained afterwards. Besides, spite of her Christianity, Julia's nature feels that Fanny's revenge is natural, almost justi- fiable. Seduction is as great a crime as murder, and even the Book of books says, "He that sheddeth man's" (or woman's) "blood, by man " (or woman) " shall his blood be shed." Be that as it may, Julia now malies a last effort to bring back the wanderer; but, alas I in vain.  Fanny's ,hot, passionate, desperate nature has now got the upperhand; i her past wrongs, her future revenge, are now prominent in her  6   122        ERmING, YET NOBLE. mind; and the golden occasion of repentance and reformation is lost. A noise is heard outside on the stairs, laughter, and loud con- versation. Fanny turns to her companion. "These," she says, "are the friends " (a bitter, sarcastic emphasis is laid upon this last word) " whom I told you I expected. They are coming up to see me. Such as you should not meet such as they are. You must go. I do not understand you, but I know what you have endeavored to do for me; and, believe me, though it is all in vain, I shall never forget it. God bless you " (how strange it sounds to hear a wretched, hopeless, godless woman say "God bless you "). "Good bye. Nay, do not stay. You must go, and at once." Then, as her new, true friends, as the disap- pointed Julia and Mcary slowly moved towards the door of the apartment, the passionate, beautiful, ill-fated, desperate Fanny suddenly rushed to them, kissed them, and taking Mary's hand- kerchief and Julia's Bible (which our heroine still held in her hand) said, "Farewell forever. I shall keep these as memorials of this visit, as keepsakes of you. Good bye--God bless you." She opened the door, and her new friends, her would-be redeem- ers departed. They met on the stairs two gaudily dressed young women, thq looseness of whose manners was emblematic of the looseness of their morals, and Julia sighed as she thought that these crea- tures were " the friends " of Fanny. They also encountered the old negress, and caught a glimpse in the passage of the bloated figure, the cruel face, and the slovenly dress of the " landlady " herself--a wretch, at the very sight of whom Julia shivered with disgust and loathing. At last they gained the " street door," and thus ended their morning's visit to a victim.                       .*   ,              ER RINRG, YET *OBLE.        123 CHAPTER VI. THE SISTERS; OR, NONE ARE ALL EVIL. ABOUT twenty miles' from -New York, near a pleasant little village, is situated " a boarding school for young ladies." It is not a school, thank Heaven, of the usual kind, where a young girl is taught everything that is fashionable, nothing that is  valuable; where she is instructed in the cleigantly useless branches to the exclusion of ail that is solidly useful; where she is put into the hands of the music-master, and the professor of languages, and the dancing professor, but seldom sees the inside of a-kitchen or of an Engulish grammar; where she becomes fluent in Freuch, perfect in the polka, au fait in every vanity, but grows as heartless as elegant, as extravagant as use- less, and as irreligious as accomplished. Neither was this school conducted on the " cramming system," which is so prevalent in many of our seminaries.  Thie course of study did not embrace all conceivable branches of knowledge, all varieties of learning, whether valuable to the female scholar or not. No, the school in question was a religiously-conducted, sensibly-ordered institu- tion, where the pupil was educated in ttle useful as well as the ornamental branches, and where the morals were taken care of as well as the mind. The number of pupils was limited; they were taken at an  early are and trained gradually, faithfully, pleasantly, alld surely, into right modes of thinking and of living.  It was not, therefore, a popular school; but it was, nevertheless, a very good one. The hlead of the establishment was an old lady, who, having honorably reared several daugh- ters of her own, knew how to bring  up the children of other people. Among the scholars was a bright, fine-looking girl of about   124        EBING, YET NOBLE. fifteen years of age, who had- been placed here several years ago by her sister, who, though she never took the child home with her, came regularly to see hei young relative. The girl's name was Annie Watson, and nothing was known of her, sav- ing that she was a talented, good child, and was very much attached to her sister, who seemed to be her only living relation, and who paid the expenses of her education. It was a hot day, and the boarding-school for young ladies, near the village of was very still, as becomes a school during the "summer vaca- tion." The building was large and by no means inelegant, and was pleasantly situated on a grassy lawn, with fine, large woods behind it, and the village at some distance to the front. It was almost the hour of noon, and a small band of pupils who (either from the space that separated them from their homes, or from some other reason) still remained'at the seminary, notwithstand- ing the holidays, were enjoying themselves as best they could in the woods back of their home. And to judge by the shouts of merry laughter that were wafted upon the air, the group were happy enough.  Children, thank God, are generally light- hearted; it is only when we ceases to be children that we cease to be happy. One of the gayest of the party was Annie Wat- son. Her laugh was' loudest, her song was merriest, her .step was fleetest. She seemed the spirit of fun incarnate. Generally inclined to thought, to-day she is embodied merriment. "Oh, sunny days of childhood; Oh, blessed hours, when care Was but a myth, and pleasure   A4pfelace were everywhere." But suddenly Annie Watson started from her companions, and looked for a moment intently at a female figure advancing from the seminary towards the spot where she and her comrades were sporting. Yes, she recognizes the figure. It is that of her sister, her dear, elder sister, her almost mother, who has come to pay her a visit; and, not finding her in the house, has sought her in the woods. With a glad cry of delight, Annie rushes   .?             EBRRING, YET NOBLE.        125 Aand meets the figure half way; And throws herself into her sister's arms. "Dear, darling sister, how glad, how very glad I am to see you! I have been wanting you so much." "And I you, dear Annie,' replies her visitor, kissing her fondly. The two, enticed by the beauty of the day, resolve upon having a stroll through the woods, " all to themselves," as Annie expressed it. They accordintgly saunter away together, arm in arm, and it would have been evident to the most casual observer that a more than common bond of love existed between them. Especially did the stranger, the elder one (a fine-looking creature, beautiful, luxuriously attired, and yet evidently not a happy woman), seem to be tenderly attached to her young, and innocent companion, mingling with the fondness of a sister the yearning love of a mother. Every now and then she would kiss " her darling Annie,' as she called her, and stroke her hair fondly, and call her every endearing name. On reaching the woods the pair seated themselves under one of the oldest, largest and most leafy trees, and entered into an animated and loving conversation. The younger sister spoke of her studies, of " the fun she had during the nice vacations," of the other girls, and similar topics; while the elder listened with the warmest inte- rest, making tender inquiries as to the health and personal com- fort of the speaker. But when the child spoke of the morning and evening prayers, and reading of the Bible, to which she was g;   accustomed, a close observer (had such a third party been pre- sent) would have noticed a momentary confusion on the part of the listener; a blush of shame, it might be, tinging the cheek of the elder sister. The confusion increased and the blush deepened as tie child spoke .in an earnest, loving way of the pure, virtuous teachings she and her companions daily received from  " dear Mrs. Norton " (the head of the schooD. One would almost have thought the elder sister imagined that the youthful a    being beside her was reproaching her with a lack of the religion and virtue which had been taught the child herself. And yet   126        ERTRG, YET NOBLE. when the latter had finished her narration, the elder folded her in a loving embrace, and said, most tenderly yet solemnly: "Annie, darling--Annie, darling, take care that you ever bear in mind your dear Mrs. Norton's precepts. You never can be happy in this world unless you are good. Be religious, be vir- tuous; love your books, and your-your Bible, and your-your God " (she hesitated strangely about uttering those two simple, common words, "God" and. "Bible ").  "Live good, pure, holy, and then you will live and die happy:. And yet there seemed to be a sort of despair in the tone in which she gave thisaruly sisterly advice, as though, right as it was, she could never follow it herself. But this mayhap is merely our own fancy. At any rate, the innocent Annie Watson notices nothing of the matter, and suddenly exclaims": "Oh, sister, I would so like to go with you to the city, now and then. Why don't you take me to your home sometimes duling vacations?'- Why not, truly? 'Tis a very simple and natural question. Yet it causes the one of whom it is asked to turn first pale, and then red, as shereplies: "How often must I tell you, dear Annie, that I do not wish your mind to be taken off from its studies until you have completely finished your education?" "Oh, God, if she did but know what a hell my home, as she calls it, is!"But these last strange words are muttered, not spoken, and her young sister does not hear them, and asks: "Where do youive, sister? Why must I always direct my letters to some box at the post office, and not to you at your own house?   And whyl  must I call myself Watson, when I know that our father's name was not Watson? Poor fatlher I how I think about him sometimes. He used to love you so. And how sorry I feel, sister, to thnk that you had that great' trouble with him, whatever it was about. And how do you live, sister? Are you rich? Are you married?" Strange questions these for one sister to ask of another I Stranger yet that a sister should be unwilling or unable to answer them! Yet these questions are not answered. But the elder sister evades reply (it seems as though every word of her   pERRING, YET NOBLE.                       127 companion had been a stab at her heart), and- the conversation ;I    changes. -Soon the sound of the dinner-bell is heard from the piazza of the seminary, and the merry party of hoydens, joined by the two sisters, return through the summer heat and beautv to the - quiet house. There the principal, a capital old lady, meets the visitor, and politely invites her to dine with them ; an invitation gladly accepted. The rieal is wholesome, abundant, and well cooked, far different from the poorly served, scantily supplied tables which are to be found in the majority of our schools. The repast is enlivened by conversation, and is a pleasant affair. After dinner, the whole party amuse themselves with a game of romps in-doors,'in which the visitor heartily participates, and instantly becomes popular with the children. She enjoys the unusual fun; perhaps she is happier, really happier, playving with the children than shel has been for years. She forghets, for the while, bler sorlrows, perchance the sins of her life ; the des- perate look departs momentarily from her beautiful face; would to Heaven that she had never been doing aught else save romp- ing with the children. But in course of time the little party separate (as all parties do), the game of romps ends (as all games must), and the two sisters, arm in arm return to their woodland solitude. They l^"ii .  seek the deepest shade, for it is now very warm; and, in their leafy shelter, they converse. Suddenly Annie exclaimes : "This is just the kind of a place that dear father used to love i ^tpo take a nap ill on the summer afternoons."    Then the child paused, as though in thought, and softly murmured, "Poor father l" There was little in the words, but much in their tone. And the tears rushed into the eyes of the elder sister as she "tlistened. True, too true, "poor, poor father l"    But away with melancholy; those who have real sorrows never can afford to indulge in unavailing ones. "How beautiful the sky looks, seen just over the top of the trees, Annie!" "Yes, dear sister; I sometimes think, I know it is very fool-   128        EBRLTGI, YET NOBLE. -ish, but I cannot help it, that GodIs face must, be blue. It is such a lovely color, aud seems so pure. And then I fancy that God's eyes must be stars; so that he must look, when smiling, just like the heavens upon a moonlight night. Just as they looked last night, sister. You saw the sky last night, didn't you?" k A Yes, it was a beautiful night." Ah, Annie, we fear that your sister does not often look upon the skies at night. "Oh, I thought of you all last evening, dear sister," said Annie. "I wondered what you were doing, and whether you ever thought of me. And then I took a book and read about great men and heroes. Did you ever meet a hero?"  "Who-1-f" replied the elder sister, bitterly. "I meet with heroes! Ah, Annie, darling, you are very young or else you would know that heroes are very uncommon. About one man in a million is noble ; the rest are mean, selfish, heartless ; liars and hypocrites, all.-' Sle spoke as though she had felt by expe- rience the truth of her words. If so, God help her. God help all women who think of men thus. "Oh, sister, how can you talk so?" rejoined Annie. "There must surely be many good people in the world. Else how could there be a good God to govern it?" Ah! the logic of children is often irresistible. The conversation went on, and' the afternoon waned on, and at last the elder sister, rising, said it was time for her departure to the city. And again the younger one makes a remark which, simple as it is, causes a pang to shoot t hroughl every fiblre of her sister's being. "Why must you go to-day?    Why not wait till to-morrow? You never stnay with me over, night. What can you have to do at nights in the city always?" "What can she-have to do at nights?" Ah, Annie Watson, or what^ever your name may be, you should not have asked this question. The farewell kiss is given and taken; the sisters hlave separated. Annie Watson returns to her school-mates, and her sister hastens in the evening train to NTew York. The "elder sister" of this chapter, reader, is no one more or no one less than the Fanny Wallers rf the last!   I             ERRING, YET NOBLE.        129 -It will be remembered that in the story of her life, nar. rated to Julia, Fanny had spoken of a younger sister, a child, who, after her father's misfortunes and death, had disappeared. This child was the present Annie Watson, and had been taken away through Fanny's own agency, who, on hearing of her father's death as an almost pauper, determined to take care of her orphan sister, and to support her in comfort and honor, even though it were by her own earnings of shame. She resolved that though her fall had caused his pecuniary ruin and death, it should not, at least, injure her only relative still left-the "little sister" who had always loved her, and looked up to her as a mother-she who had won-  dered at her flight and her father's anger, though hardly old enough to know the cause. Fanny Walters, therefore, took her sister, placed her at the school just mentioned, impressing upon her the necessity of adopting an assumed name (the reasons which led Fanny to this step can readily be imagined), and there, kept in blessed ignorance of her beloved one's true life and character, Annie Watson grew up contented and virtuous. While the "elder sister," she who was so determined upon the peace and holy happiness of her self-imposed charge, meanwhile revelled in noise, and trasts and inconsistencies of human nature, even of nature- in the same individual I 1 - Such are the facts which go to prove that a bad woman may yet be a good sister! Such are some illustrations of the great truth that none are wholly fallen-that some gleams of Heaven can still be found even in the bosom of a modern Magdalene I NOTE.--This chapter is not a fancy sketch. We know of an unfortunate wo. man who is, at this moment, supporting, under similar circumstances, a sister whom she tenderly loves. Truth is stranger than fiction.   130        ERR OT, YET NOBLE. CHAPTERK VII. A STRANGE MAN AND STRANGE MUSIC.  ( NOT far from the residence of Mr. Russel, Julia's guardian, lived a rich, but odd family by the name of Kincarde. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Kincarde, Miss Jeannette and Miss Eliza Kincarde, Mr. Shiner (Mrs. Kincarde's brother, who was familiarly called " old Uncle Shine"), and Miss Claude Clarke, a relative of the family, from the country, who served as a " companion" for the young ladies. The family were rich, very rich, havinga an extensive fac- tory, etc., a fine town house, a cottage at the sea shore, horses; carriages, and many- servants. All the members of the family were warmly attached to each other. The men were capital " men of business," and fMrs. Kincarde, " the old lady," was a woman of very strong mind; but all the family, without exception (saving -Miss Claude Clarke), were igllo- rant, uneducated, low in their tastes, strange in their dress and notions, extravagant, purse-proud and irreligious. The men were " infidels," the mother was a part "skeptic" and part " spiritualist," while the daughters, to use a common expressive phrase, " were nothing." All the family were very ugly also, repulsive, strange, and some of them filthy in their personal appearance. Mr. Kincarde was a "hard drinker ;" his wife was a " vegetarian ;" the girls, as well as their mother, were passionately addicted to gaudy dresses. All the family had thin lips, expressive of their sharp tempers, which latter found a vent occasionally in ' family jars," which seldom resulted, however, in anything serious. A shrill, unpleasant voice was also a general characteristic of the Kincardes. They lived, as before remarked, in fine ,.                C   -ERRBINxG YET NOBLE.       131 style, but the arrangements of their dwellings, were " odd," their furniture was "odd," their library, such as it was, was of a peculiar character, and though of low extraction, of "mechanical origin," the women of the family were as haughty a trio of females as could be found in New York city, or elsewhere. They were of New England, "Down East," or "Yankee" origin, Kincarde being by trade a carpenter, and Shiner a locksmith.  But they were industrious and shrewd; and Shiner, having invented and perfected some improvements in machinery, assisted therein by his sister, who married Kincarde, he took his brother-in-law into partnership with him and commenced business.. The firm was soon extended by the admission of two brothers by the name of Holt, who furnished capital. In course of time the Holts were "re. moved" by some chicanery, though their capital was retained, and the firm of Shiner &  Kincarde soon became rich and settled permanently in New York. They prospered exceed- ingly, but were as "mean" to others (though more extrava- gant towards themselves) in their days of wealth as in their season of poverty.  In short, the only being under the roof of the Kincardes who was truly "human" and truly loveable, was the "poor companion," AIiss Claude Clarke. It is a  pleasant afternoon, and Mr. George H. Shiner (' Uncle Shine") is busy in his room, the third story front of the city residence of the Kincardes. Mr. Shiner is an old man, and a  very ugly one. He is very thin, very short, and very angular, and ungraceful in form ; his eyes are small, sharp, restless, shrewd but unplea- sant; his cheeks are colorless and sunken;  his lips thin, while his hair, though white, is coarse and scanty; his hands and feet are extraordinarily large in proportion to his size; and his movements are as clumsy as those of .a bear; he has a peculiar habit of almost constantly moving his head up and down, like one of those toy figures we see in the windows';   1-32        ERRITN, YET NOBLE. and his smile is a very disagreeable thing to behold; it is so bitter and yet so ghastly, so corpse-like. This singular looking being is dressed in as singular a garb. It consists of a very old-fashioned, very long-tailed coat, almost an overcoat, buttoned closely round the form, so that scarcely any shirt is visible ; and a drab pair of pantaloons, very short, not reaching to the clumsy, common, dirty boots which cover his large feet. The whole suit could not be sold at any price to any old clothes vender ; for the very poorest old clothes vender in town would refuse to purchase it. AMean as the suit is, it is nearly threadbare, and is very dirty besides--like his linen, full of spots and stains. Take :Mr. George H. Shiner altogether, and you might easily find a more suitable model for a Romeo, a Claude Melnotte, or even an old gentlemon. The appearance of the room is as strange as that of its occu- pant. It is, generally speaking, very cheaply, in fact, meanly furnished. A plain washstand, a common -bedstead, two or three of the most ordinary chairs, a rough settee, a cheap, small, sec- ond-hand, old bureau, a small glass, and a writing-table comprise the furniture. Not a print or painting hangs upon the walls, and the carpet is merely a collection of rags. So far all is typi. cal of the meanness and avarice of "Uncle Shine." But there are other objects in the room which speak of his better qualities, We do not allude to that small "safe" there, in the corner by the bed; for in that he merely keeps money, mortgages, notes, deeds, his will, and the like. But we refer, first, to that model of a machine, which shows his mechanical skill, and which is placed nearly in the centre of the room. And, second, to that pialno,which stands near the window.- Now a machine and a piano may seem strangely out of place in a bed-room. So they are. But, then, Uncle Shine is a very strange old man. And, besides, this apartment is not merely his bed-room, but he has taken a queer fancy to it, and prefers spending his leisure time in it rather than in any other room in the whole house. So that, after all, it is not so odd that he should in this apartment seek Oto gratify his three great passions-his avarice, by the mean   EerIN, YET NOBLE.         133 S-,q  furniture and the well-filled safe ; his love of mechanics, by his model; and his fondness for music by means of the piano. On the mantle-board, over the fire-place, lie a few books, conspicuous among which is a large, well-bound copy of Tom Paine's Age of Reason. On the floor, near the model, is negligently thrown a, rich  cushion. One of his nieces paid a visit to "I Uncle Shine " in his room recently, and brought this cushion (to which she was very partiaD to sit upon. And when she left, she had forgotten to take back the cushion with her. So there it remained still, upon the floor, near the model. It is important that the reader should bear in mind this cushion. We said that Uncle Shine is busy; we were correct-busy - he is. He goes to his safe, opens it, and takes from it an envelop. It is filled with bank-notes of large amount. He counts tie notes carefully, twice. They-are all right-five thousand dollars; i   a valuable envelop, truly. Good God I how many crimes have been committed, how many souls have been lost, for less, much less, than the value of this envelop I Good God I how many men who have died upon the gallows, would have died good citizens; how many women who sin upon our streets, would have lived happy and virtuous wives and mothers, had they but possessed the value of this envelop 1 . Oh, money, money, won- der of wonders, who can understand thee 1 But these are our reflections, not those of 'Uncle Shine, who proceeds to take from the safe other envelopes similarly filled. He counts these ; these too are all correct in amount. Itow could they be otherwise? Does he not keep the key of the safe himself, after locking it most carefully (and the lock, by-the-by, is a very peculiar one, and defies picking)? But then it is a habit of his to count his money nightly. And to-night he calculates that he has forty- five thousand dollars in notes in his keeping-or, rather, in that of his safe's; and this is all his own. Besides some thirty thous- and dollars in bank, and about six times that amount invested in first class city mortgages, and in various " outside" securities,   134  - :     EIRrrG, YET NOBLE. which yield him much more than le'gal interest. About a quar. ter of a million of dollars, besides the money invested by him in the firm of Shiner & Kincarde. As the old man thinks of his immense possessions, his soul swells with pride--the pride of suc- cess and power. Ugly, as he is, ugly and little, dirty and awk- ward, he seems almost sublime as his eyes glisten and his frame dilates with the superb, supremo consciousness of wealth. And he looks from his envelopes, deeds, and notes out into the clear and beautiful sunlight of Heaven with a smile, not this time bit- ter and ghastly, but almost regal. For is he not a king? Can- not he command more than two hundred and fifty thousand dol- lars worth of virtue, vice, talent, folly, pleasure, or what else lie may desire? Cannot he, if he chooses, buy and sell men, women, children, hearts, consciences and souls? Ugly and dirty as he is, is he not more than a king? - Is he not a god? For are not riches this world's deities? And is he not rich? And gods can- not die? Old as lie is, why should he then fear death? Why should he have taken the useless trouble of making a will? And in a sudden transport of frenzy he tears up the will which he last month made. Now this destruction of 4' the last will and testament of George H. Shiner "'was the unwitting work of a monlent ; but its con- sequences were of the utmost importance to several of the person- ages of our narrative ; as we will see hereafter. Uncle Shine, after his fit of momentary monetary frenzy had passed, was rather ashamed of himself, and regretted. the tearing of the will. But, determining to draw up a new one, he replaced his valuable envelopes, deeds, etc., in the safe ; and then betook hifself to the examination of his model machine. -Tis a singular affair, full of wheels, cranks and contrivances- an intricate arrangement, which none could comprehend save himself; but to him it is as plain as the sun at noon-day. He can see at a glance the general idea of the whole, and the par- ticular service of each special part. For is he not the inventor? Mr. Slinler is as great a mechanical genius as he is essentially a mean man; and his keen old eyes sparkle -as he inspects his   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         135 model. It embodies a new discovery in mechanics; he confi  dently expects ere long to present it to the world--to reap fame and additional fortune from it. Odd as Uncle Shille is, let us reverence him as he kneels beside his model, and handles, it with almost a parent's love. For our ideas are our children, are they not? And glorious children they are, too; thoughl they ofttimes disappoint their parents. Having devoted an hlour to his model, he now betakes himself to the piano. 'Tis a magnificent instrument--one of the finest, probably, in existence. He has spared nolexpense to procure it; he loves it more than aught else on earth or elsewhere, saving his money and his model. He opens it, and, spite of his aged fingers, evokes music from its keys, music which a much younger man need not have been ashamed of. But the old- man, having at last exhausted his repertoire of harmony, rises, closes the instrument, and emersed in a sudden sea of thought, walks up and down the apartment. And now a little incident occurs--a little incident which might have been a tragedy ; a little incident which shows how close are the confines of those two great kingdoms, Life and Death. While the old man is thus thinking and walkitng; he stumbles, his foot is caught in the rags which serve as the carpet of the rich miser's room, he falls heavily, and strikes the cushion which, as before described, lies upon the floor, directly next to the model machine. Had he fallen but a few inches more to one side, he would have struck the iron work of the model, and the shock would probably have killed him. Yes; the rich man would then have become mere clay--clay not worth the buying of the poorest man on earth. All his mortgages, investments, and bank accounts would have i ^been unable to save him. He has escaped eternity by a few inches and a cushion I But is he thankful to Providence for this escape, this cushion, and these inches? Not he. He acknowl- edges no Providence to thank. With a, curse, which sounds hor ribly upon his aged and withered lips, he rises. He is not seri- ously hurt, and soon recovers from the shock of his fall. But in passing his hands over his person, to ascertain whether   136        ERRINO, YET NOBLE. he was injured by his accident, he encounters something in one of his lower pockets (which he very seldom uses), which from the feel of it he supposes to be a book. He thrusts his hand in, and ascertains that his surmise is correct. It is a book. But how did it get there? Who placed it in his pocket? Certainly not he himself, for he never carries books about with him. But what is the book? It is a sm411 volume bound in black. 'Tis a copy of the New Testament,'and with Claude Clarke's name on the fly leaf. "Damn that girl," the old man cries, s" will she never cease trying to mrnvert me, as she calls it? She is constantly attempting some pious trick like this upon me. Slipping Bibles into my coat pockets, and so on. But it is of no use, Mriss Clarke. It is of no use. The old man is not to be fooled at his time of life." And so saying, in a fit of anger, he throws the Testament out of the wintow. The time may come when the old man awill be sorry for tlis act. Uncle Shine then takes down from its resting place his bible, called "The Age of Reason," by Tom Paine, (the greatest blackguard of his century), and begins its perusal for the hun- dredth time. There he sits, by the Window, that ugly, dirty, strange, mean, -gifted, rich, old, white-haited man, in his oddly- filled room, with the piano, and the model, and the safe, and the paltry bed-room furniture; there he sits, by the window, with the calm sunlight of a lovely autumn afternoon falling upon him from God's Heaven ; there he sits, to;tering on the very verge of eternity, reading a work of lies ani blasphemy, with Claude Clarke's Testament in the gutter of t]e street, many feet below him.  He sits and reads the Age of Reason until the growing dark- ness prevents him. Then he muses in ithe darkness on his money and his model. A few hours have elapsed, and "Uncle Shine," Mrs. Kin- carde and Miss Eliza Kincarde are seated in their sumptuous but oddly-furnished parlor, engaged in animated conversa- tion. There seems to be a difference of opinion existing   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        137 between Mr. Shiner and his niece, while the mother inclines now to one side of the argument, now to the other, and seems endeavoring to reconcile both the disputing parties. But in vain. Eliza Kincarde is as sharp-tempered and as obstinate as Mrs. Kincarde herself, and is, in fact, the only one of the family who is not altogether under the influence of her mother. And so the war of words wages on between the 'old man and the young woman. The subject of the quarrel is one of great interest to all ladies in general, i. e., a young man who is " paying attentions" to Miss Eliza Kincarde, and who is as much liked by the niece as he is detested by the uncle. The latter says that the young man shall not con- tinue his visits, the former says that he shall, and neither party seems disposed to yield. "Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth" (for " little fire" in this case read " young man"). In the course of the evening a compromise is nomi- nally agreed to between "Uncle Shine" and Miss Eliza; but it is only a hollow truce, and the old man retires for the night with an angry feeling in his heart towards his niece that produced the most important pecuniary consequences. As we shall see hereafter. that quarrel was-the cause of Miss Eliza Kincarde losing a large part of a quarter of a nmillion of dollars; for let it be remembered, Uncle Shine had torn up the old will (in which Miss Eliza Kincarde's name figured) and had lot yet made a new one. Several days have elapsed. It is a warm and delightful evening, and an old man is walking leisurely along one of the most retired streets of our great city. On such an hour of such a nigllht generally the whole population can be found seated at the windows, or on the door-steps of theoir houses. On such an hour of such a night the father of a family, compellec to remain in town by business, or from lack of the means essential to a watering-place or summer-retreat life, is to be seen out-doors chatting with his neighbor, and smoking his cigar. The children play around him, or run to                         .   138       ERRIN, YET NOBLE. and fro in the hazy light. The lovers sit by the window, looking out on the night, with their hands secretly clasped, and (for all we know) occasionally a kiss, a sweet, soft, loving, summer-evening kiss, is given or received between them. While in the back-room, or possibly at the " other window," sits the old grandmother, watching the street chil. dren at their play, and thinking of those happy times long past when she, too, was a child, and loved the sumnmer even- ings dearly. And upon all alike, upon the father, the chil- ,dren, the lovers, and the grey-haired woman, almost too old to love, shine the delicately twinkling stars. Oh! there are few things more delightful than a summer's evening in the city, savincg a summer's evening in the country! But the street in which the old man is walking has but few signs of life, at least of out-door existence. It is a " retired," a " shabby-genteel" street, inhabited by those who "have once seen better days," and who are, therefore, not disposed in their declining fortunes to be very merry. The old man does not look like one who ever troubles himself much whether an evening is a summery or a wintry one. He is very thin, short, and ungraceful, with small, sharp eyes, scanty, coarse white hair, large hands and feet, and is very clumsy in his movements. On his head he wears a very'old, worn-out, high white beaver hat (this hat, we may remark, he invariably wears on all occasions) ; his coat is of a singular shape, length and pattern ; his pants are of a dirty drab, and his boots are of a dirty brown, not having been made acquainted for some time with any species of blacking; lie also carries in his hand, notwithstanding that there is not the slightest sign of rain, a huge common cotton umbrella. This is his constant companion. The old white hat and the cotton umbrella never desert him. His linen, too, is soiled, and his'hands and face are by no means clean. Certainly he is nlot a gentleman; undoubtedly he is an odd character; probably he is a poor man ; possibly a beggar, judging by his -clothes, for his whole suit could not be sold   ERRTGt, YET. NOBLE.        139 at any price and yet he may not be a beggar after all. Poor clothes sometimes cover rich men! He has, too, we notice, a peculiar habit of almost constantly moving his head up and down, which is quite amusing  He also has a habit of muttering to himself, in a very low tone, it is true, yet clear enough, if we can only get close enough to him. But  he passes on. Let us follow him. -Along the retired, quiet street he wends his way, mutter- / ing and bobbing his head as he goes.  But he stops and listens intently. He hears the sound of music-nothing remarkable in that on a summer's evening. Yes, but it is not often one hears such music as this. 'Tis not mere melody it is inspiration. The piano upon which it is played is a mag- nificently-toned instrument, and the person who is now per- f6rming, whoever he or she may be, is certainly a musician worthy of the instrument., The sounds proceed from yonder house, one of the few residences in this street which have any signs of life about them-that house yonder, with the front-windows open. The old man glances at it, looks at the number; he recognizes it-knows the house well, But what need a beggar care for fine music? At any rate, our - supposed beggar does care for it. He advances to the win- dows, so eagerly listening to the harmony that he forgets even to nod his head, or to mutter to himself as usual. He reaches the window, and, being very short, stands, as it were, under it, almost hidden from view of any within the house Now the music ceases, and the queer old man gives vent to a curse, which sounds fearfully out of place on such aged lips. But the melody resumes again, even more gloriously than before. Gods t what a magnificent ecstacy is true music I Life hath no pleasure like the joy that lies in sweet sounds I Now the strain is plaintive, thrilling the soul like, as it were, the tears of an archangel I Anon the chords are tender, as though the fingers that pressed them were moved by impulses from a heart of love. Then the music grows merry awhile, and brings with it souvenirs of ball-rooms and   "O        ERRING,- YET NOBLE. gorgeous festivals. Then again the 'harmonies become indescribably grand, grand as the choruses must be that are sung in the presence of Jehovah I Truly there are heavenly charms in music, Truly thie musi- cian of to-night is a performer of no common order. And under the open window stands the strange, ugly, dirty old man, with his white hat bobbing ceaselessly up and down, as his head keeps a sort of weird time to the music ; his old cotton umbrella, waving to and fro in the air, as a-la-Maretzek the old beggar leads some imaginary orchestra. Truly -it is a very odd spectacle., Is the old man crazy as well a aa beggar? But suddenly a child's voice is heard within the house, saying- "Miss Julia, Miss Julia, what is that queer thing going about so, up and dow n, first to one side and then to the other, right at our window there? Let me go and see what it is." The child has caught an occasional glimpse of our music-mad friend, the beggar's, hat and umbrella, as they undergo their course of musical gymnastics outside. Pushing forward, the little girl sees the music-mad beggar himself. For a moment the child gazes, open-mouthed, wide-eyed, at this singular spectacle ; uncertain whether to cry with fear, or to laugh ; for it is but a step from the terrible to the ludicrous, and what might frighten a child, when it is carried to too great an extent will only amuse it. At last the little girl burst into a hearty fit of laughter, the absurdity of the sight overcoming her wonder at it. It is too funny. And then she calls to her companion. "Oh, bMiss Julia, come and look at this queer old beggar man, who dances so strangely. He looks for all the world like one of those monkeys on the top of one of those stieet organs. Come quick, and look at this funny old crazy beggar man." -Attracted by the child's exclamation, her companion, the performer who has raisedthis brilliant storm of harmony, leaves the piano, and advances to the window. She proves to be no other than our heroine herself. What does she here in this ItN   IERRING, YET NOBLE.        141 third-rate house, in this third-rate, lonely street? At any rate, Julia Witherson it is. But by this time, as the music has ceased, the old man in the street has somewhat recovered from his " temporary insanity." He ends his gymnastics. Perhaps, too, he is somewhat ashamed of himself., He now also notices the child looking intently at him, and leaning over her the form of Julia Witherson. And now the strange old man does another strange tiling.  He directly addresses himself to Julia. "Are you," he asks, abruptly, "the one who was playing upon the piano just now?" Julia has been looking at the old man from head to foot He is an oddity certainly, both in appearance. and 'character. But she is not certain that he is either a lunatic or a beggar. She can hardly tell why, but she instinctively forms the notion that he is not altogether what he seems. There is, to her at least, an indescribable, undefinable 'something about him'which leads her to think that perhaps he may only be shabby alld eccentric, not really insane or in wanlt. Iis intelligent eyes and the ring on his finger, have not escaped her observation ; for he is now very close to her, as she leans out of the window towards him. At any rate he is a " character ;" the meeting with himn is somewhat of an adventure; they are unobserved, and, as he is a very old man, he cannot compromise her ; so Julia humors him, and replies to his question just recorded with a "Yes, I am." "Can  you play the 'Prayer' in Rossini's 'Moses- in Egypt?'" he asks.  Here is a question; such a one as he asking for the "Prayer " in "Moses in Egypt 1" He is a fine figure for a connoiseur in music I A fashionable habituet of the opera, truly I Who on earth can he be?  So thinks Julia. But she replies to this second question, also, in the affirmative. "Play it for'mle," says the strange old man. Abrupt enough in all conscience. But something leads her to-night to humor this eccentric being. Perhaps it was fate that led her to be on this occasion so accommodating For certainly the whole destiny   "2        ERRINGc, YETr NOBLE. of her future life was affected by her conduct this evening. She complies with the strange old man's strange request, and, re. seating herself at the piano, executes with skill and feeling Rossini's magnificent composition. Suddenly she is startled by the child's exclamation: "The old man is coming in here, Miss Julia!"True enough, the old man is ascending the front steps ; and as the-door is open he enters the hall and advances towards the parlor. "This is a little too much," thinks our heroine, at first; but she is in a peculiar mood to-night; this man has exercised some mysterious fascination upon her, so her second thought is;, "Let him come in. He is old and can do no harm. He will serve to amuse me." So she does not oppose his entrance. The old man walks into the rather dilapidated room, which serves as the parlor of the house, seats himself near the piano with as much coolness as though the house was his own, and beckons to Julia to resume her playing, which she had ceased at the child's exclamation. Wondering at lierself, Julia complies; the stranger listening intently, and showing his delight by all manner of odd grimaces and gestures. "Can you play any airs from Don Giovanni?" abruptly asks the old man.. "Certainly he cannot be what he seems," says Julia to herself. "No beggar could thus ask for and appreciate the Moses and the Giovanni I Who can he be? Perhaps he is himself some great artist. Artists are always eccentric. Be he whom he may, I will gratify my whim, and see this adventure to its end." It is,- indeed, an " adventure." Let us call it Providence. Our heroine plays brilliant morceaux from Mozart's chef-dxu- vre, and then the insatiable beggar asks for more. "Play me," he cries, " from Trovatore.' Still under the influence of her unaccountable fascination, Ju- lia plays from Verdi. "Magnificent IP exclaims the old man, ' magnificent I What is your name, young woman?" This is going too far. Julia refuses to give her name. But he insists.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        143 "I have a reason for wishing to know," he says, " a reason that concerns yourself. If you refuse to tell me, I shall find it out in spite of you." Moved by his earnestness, still under his magnetic influence, she at last gave him her name. "Where do you live?" continued the inveterate questioner. After another struggle, our heroine gave her residence also. "You live near Mr. Russell's, then?" said the old man. "Allh, I was righllt, thinks Julia, "he is not a beggar ; only some eccentric, probably rich man. He knows my uncle." Then she continues, aloud: "I live with Mr. Russell. I am his ward and niece." "Ah, then, I live near you. I will call and see you.' You must play for me often. AMy name is George 1H. Shiner." The mystery is out. She has heard her uncle speak of the Kincardes aid the eccentric Shiner. She understands all. "What are you doing here?" asks Mr. George H. Shiner. That question our heroine stubbornly refuses to answer. But we will answer it briefly for her. Julia, whose charity is ever active, discovered some time since a lady " in reduced circum- stances," a widow, and her only child, who had sought to hide their misery in this abode of genteel poverty. Miss Witherson sought them out, and delicately and kindly visited them, sympa- thized with and relieved them. She was on one of these visits of kindness to-night, and while the widow had retired to her room awhile, Julia remaining down stairs had delighted herself and her child-companion by performing upon the magnificent piano, the last relic of the former greatness of her " poor friend." While thus passing her time) Mr. Shiner had been won by the beauty of her melody, and the' reader knows the rest. But the reader does not yet know, for we now tell him, that this strange interview between Julia Witherson and Mr. George H. Shiner (who" by-the-by, was the landlord of the very house at which the meeting took place ; ao fact which may account for the coolness with which he entered it,) caused the most mo- meutous consequences to the future life of our heroine; and not   "4        ERRING, YET NOBLE. only -her, but Charles Singerly- also. The reader may not see this now at this stage of the narrativ But he will appreciate it fully hereafter. Julia often thought of this night's adventure, though she nev- er mentioned the subject, saving on one occasion, to her uncle and aunt. And Mr. Shiner somehow never made his promised call. But the old man did not forget our heroine. And when he made a new will sometime afterwards, in the place of the one he had destroyed (as recorded in the first part of this chapter), he did not include one name which should have been there- that of his rebellious and obstinate niece, Eliza Kincarde. But ill its stead he inserted the name of a young lady whom we shall not mention here, as the -reader can readily guess her identity, but who was famous for her musical accomplishments.   ERRIO, TYET NOBLE.          '5 CHAPTER VIII. A MSCELLANEOUS CHAPTER. WE are about to abandon the major portion of the person- ages of this story for a while, and to devote ourselves to the his- tory of our heroines investigations, adventures, and labors among the unfortunates of her sex. Ere we do so, however, let us take a brief, parting glance at the other characters who figure in our pages. Charles Sifgerly, the poet, who now neglects his poetry, so -far as a born artist can neglect his art, the extravagant young man, careless in his pecuniary matters, never having been tsught, by experience, the true value of money, but whose follies are redeemed by a liberal and unselfish generosity, is devoting himself to dissipation. He drinks freely, carouses deeply, and leads a sadly wild existence, which gives his mother pain. But in the midst of his revels he sighs, as the image of Julia appears to his mind. It is his ill-fated love that drives him to revelry-that and the influence and example of his intimate friend, Henry Hericot, and the smiles of Miss Kate Somers and the rest of the " fashionable set." But, after all, there is something noble in a free-handed dissi- pation like that of Singerly's, which is infinitely superior, to the meanness of soul which sometimes serves for prudence in the youngr. And there is no real cause of alarm. The advice of the Rev. George Howard, the prayers and love of his mother and his own good sense, will subdue Charles Singerly at last. Entre nous. The present is the most luxuriant and last stage of his wild oats-hereafter they will steadily decline. He will become a wiser man at last all the wiser for his early follies. As for Henry Hericot, he is as superficially brilliant, as radi- cally rotten, as a human being, by any possibility, can be. He ilSCo1;ULrrU v 7b   "6        ERRING, YET NOBLE. encourages Charles in all his errors, much to the displeasure of Mrs. Singerly, who detests Hericot; leads him from bad to worse, and meanwhile lives of of him ; borrows large sums of his friend, which he never repays, and uses and abuses Singerly in every sense. As regards Julia, Hericot pursues no fixed plan ; he cannot. understand her, so he knows not what to do. He desires revenge upon her, and yet he would fain render her serviceable. Now, lhe makes marked advances toward our heroine, and when these are repelled, he as sedulously avoids her. He has also noticed Charles' attentions to Julia, and their very sudden cessation ; there is a mys- tery here, too, which he cannot fathom ; so he watches closely, but says nothing. He amuses himself between times with Katherine Somers, who loves him as truly as such as she ca-n love; but who is too prudent to marry him, and who is also too cunning to allow herself to be betrayed by his arts. She is not virtuous at heart, but she is cold in blood and shrewd in head. As for lHericot he is aware of her penchaant for him, but he spares ler; she is useful to -him in various other ways beside the way in which most women are useful to such as he. And so he passes his time -as gay and as evil a man as walks the earth ; and worse than evil, contemptibly mean. So mean that he has retained in his possession a diamond cross given him by Julia Witherson when he vowed his false love to her in Paris. This cross is a very pe- culiar one, and very costly; it was a gift to Julia from her dead mother; but though our heroine has besought Hericot to return the cross to her, he retains it for its pecuniary value, hoping some day to obtain from Julia his own price for the relic. Noble man I We may here remark, incidentally, that Julia, in her confession to Sincgerly, alluded to the circumstance of this retaining of, the cross as an example of the character of the man who had be- trayed her, though  she did not mention his name. The per- sonal identity of her betrayer was preserved as a secret by Julia; spite of all effort of Charles Singerly to discover it. As regards the Rev. George Howard, we need say but little in this place. Hie simply did his duty, and served his Makey in the most acceptable manner-by serving his fellow-man.   He   ERRIBG, YET NOBLE.        147 was no "orthodox" Christian-not he. He was no bigoted "formalist--not he. He was not a parson according to Puril tanical ideas. You could see him at a "party" occasionally, at the theatre and opera frequently. He believed that theatrical amusements were natural, therefore harmless in themselves and essential to enjoyment. True, they were abused, as all things are, but he was no fool to confound the abuse of an institution with its legitimate use ; aud his observation had taught him that the only effectual way to correct the evils of the theatre was to lead the respectable and educated class of the community to pa- tronize it, and, by patronizing, to purify it. But while enjoying this world, our model priest also benefited it. lHe taught the noblest doctrines, practised the purest mo- rality, and exhibited the most generous charity. And amid the excitement, temptations, and trials of this world he kept steadily in view the world to come. He was a true friend to Charles and Julia, a true priest to his flock, and a true servant to heaven. Katherine Somers continued to flirt-and talk scandal, to pro- fess piety and to practise deceit. She read Bulwer in secret, and the Bible in public ; was precise in her tongue, and impure in her heart; souoht to marry Charles Sinerly for his money, though she loved him' not ; loved Hericot after a fashion, but married him not; hated Julia, and watched her intercourse with Singerly jealously, though she claimed loudly to be our heroine's dearest friend; and danced and dressed, or rather undressed, through life as though it were a bal masque. So much for so much I And now for Julia Witherson. For a space we will leave the direct path of our narrative and devote our attention- to the consideration of our "erring sis- ters," and the experiences of our heroine among them. Those of our readers who peruse this work merely as a con' nected story, are hereby advised to omit Books Third and Fourth, and to recommence their perusal of our work at Book Fifth. But tiose who read to be informed as well as amused, those who read for Thought as well as Pleasure, are respectfully solicited not to follow the above advice. ,            BOOKE T H B1] TIID. / OUR ERRING SISTERS. CHAPTER      I. INTRODUCTORY. IN the treatment of outr present subject, -' unfortunate women," we will, as a rule, follow the course of our heroine, among these creatures. We will sometimes describe her adventures directly, sometimes indirectly, and occasionally lose sight of her alto- gether. In brief, we shall endeavor to treat of the phases of our theme as shall be most convenient. "Book Third," then, is a series of separate sketches, each sketch illustrating a phase of the general theme. The chapters are to be regarded separately not collectively; the book is episodical. This may seem unartistic, but it is unavoidable. And perhaps, after all, such an arrangement will answer our purposes better than an orthodox system. At any rate, it will be, at least, original. *   -'  -5   *   *   *   *   * It is a beautiful day. Heaven smiles, and the city is full. Let us stand on the steps of the "St. Nicholas," and watch. Men, children, beggars, policemen, officers, vagrants, thieves, clergymen, gamblers, editors, millionaires pass before us. Women, too, now, at this high noon, are in the majority. They are of all varieties. Old, young, rich, poor, ugly, and beautiful. See I here comes one of the prettiest of her sex. A flower, a queen I And yet there is an indescribable something about her which rivets our gaze most unpleasantly. Women brush their skirts from her path-gaze at her disdainfully ;. yet not merely from envy; there is a brazenness of look about her which tells its own story, and marks her as the member of a peculiar class.   fllYi         ERRING, YET NOBLE.         149 We observe that she attracts the notice of many men besides ourselves-all in fact who meet her glance at her as no man dares to glance at a modest woman. And yet, thlough she sees and knows all this, the creature passes on, gayly and recklessly, as though life had no nobler ambition than to be insolently stared at on Broadway! Several hours have elapsed, and the shades of evening have closed over the scene. Let us again take our stand on the steps of the St. Nicholas. The lights within the hotel and in the neighboring stores are very brilliant, almost eclipsing with their lustre the infinite glories of the mild and everlasting stars-those stars which from Heaven shine down so beautifully and so con- stantly upon the unheeding earth. The crowd in the streets is still large, but is composed now chiefly of men-women, that is, respectable wmen, being at this dark hour in the minority. Here stands the politician, talking loudly on matters which are far beyond his party-biassed reachl; near him is some late news- boy, bawling over his unsold journals ; hard by stands an officer, in all the petty pride of shoulder-straps and buttons ; yonder is a professional gambler, lying in wait for some unwary victim; while all varieties of mankind are passing us by in the street, all hurrying homeward. But at this very hour, alas! there is a class of beings who leave those houses which they call their homes, and who proceed to " business," These beings are women, and their business is as shameful as it shall be nameless. - They pass us constantly, presenting a living, moving panorama of iniquity. God help them!  Methinks the very heavens are blushing I Now  there comes gliding by a thin, pale-faced, sharp-featured young girl. Her eyes are blue, but as cold-look- ing as ice, and she smiles maliciously. She is evidently hard- hearted, keen, and devilish. Anon comes a poor young creature of another stamp, with a pretty face, a sweet lip, and an inno- cent look, which beautifully belies her real vileness. Then brushes past a tall, queenly woman, with a gaudy dress and a  great amplitude of skirt, laughing noisily, and addressing the   150         ERRENG, YET NOBLE. loungers at the corners of the street in a language incompre- hensible, thank God, to women of a higher stamp. Now there passes one of those very beings who attracted so much atten- tion on the promenade this morning. She is painted and richly -apparelled, and is more wanton, worthless, wicked(, wretched, and less womanly, than ever. Close behind her, - follow two young girls, mere children in age, but old in vice ; children wlho should be at their prayers by some loving mother's side, but who are wanderers and sinners in the dark streets of an ungodly city. Behind these " lost lambs " comesperhaps the saddest sight of all, a half naked, ugly, bloated, raggedt half drunken wretch that was once a woman. And yet the hotels are full of mirth; the streets are full of light; men look on with laugh(ter or with indifference; while far above hotel, and street, and city shine quietly, and oh how purely, the softly-twiinklimg stars. Let us leave our position upon the steps of the St. Nicholas for a while and pay a brief visit to a theatre. Here all is light, music, dancing, dress, flirting, ogling, and general delight. The audience is large, and largely respectable. Many of our " lead- ing, citizens" and their families are assembled to witness the per- formance. All is order and seeming decency. But let us ascend (ascend physically and descend socially and morally) until we reach that famous, infamous institution known as the "third tier."* Hecre everything is clhanged, how changed! Let all virtuous women thank God that they have never seen a third tier. It coumes as near to our notion of Pandemonium as aught save Hell iAVf. The walls are bare and full of dirt, and the floors are as bate and dirty as the walls. At one end of the long, dark gallery is located the barest, foulest, vilest spot of all-the, bar-room. Here all varieties of villainous compounds, christened "brandy," "rum," and "gin" are sold cheaply and nastily by * The institution known as the "third tier" is now generally abol. ished in our metropolitan theatres; but it 'still exists in certain localities through- out the countls A description of it is here introduced to enable the reader to form an idea of what has been fn New York, and what still is in other places. /    ERRING, YET NOBLE.          151 an old black hag, older and more disgusting than any of the w itches in Machetl?. And at this " bar" are now standing, or leaning upon it heavily in their beastly drunkenness, a number of what were at one time women with friends and lovers, but wlho arle now outcasts. Degraded women, who ehave not seeIn a Bible or a church for years, and who will not, in all probability, hear of a God, saving on the profanle lips of their polluted compan- ions, until they hear of Him in lorrlor througll the trumpet of judgment. These poor creatnures are surrounlded by men, most of whom are as vile and worthless as themselves ; men with dirty faces, soiled hands, disrgusting beards, tolacco-filled mroutls, curse- accustomed lips, rude manners, and Godless hearts. The galleries are filled with men and women of the same class as those within the bar-room. Thlle seats are merely planks, or cushionless boards, and as many stand as sit upon them. Little attention is paid to the performlances taking place below. The habitues of the third tier have their own- matters to attend to. * Women are passing to and fro constantly thvough tlee gallery. Most of these are  old,  low ; but every now and then we meet some young- and really beautiful girl, wlhom the Allighty certainly never inltended for a " third tier." And all of the females here belong to the same general class as thlose whom we saw to- day and to-night passing the gorgeous St. Nicholas. The third tier presents an animating anld imnproving spectacle truly. Vile conversation, disgusting familiarities, drinking, swear- ing, and occasional quarrels. While upon the stage below is being performed solme highly mnoral drama, to which many highly re- spectable men and women are listening (though these aforesaid "respectable" women do not dare to raise their eyes for fear of beholding a glimpse of what we lave jus described). And out- !     side of the theatre, the streets are filled with light, pleasure, mis ery, and evil. And above the theatre, shine stilly, sweetly, saint-likely, the never sleeping stars. It is to the members of this class of women that Julia With- erson devoted herself in the effort to reclaim them. It is by   1;52        ERRING  YET NOBLE. striving to redeem such as these that she expects to redeem her own early, fataLerror. It is, therefore, to this class of unfor- tunates that we devote this Book Third of our "Tale of and for Women.'  "The end justifies the means,"-" to the pure all things are pure." Let these two proverbs be alike the author's justification for writing, and the reader's excuse for .perusing these chapters, devoted to a consideration of the true state of, and the true course to be pursued towards " our erring sisters," who are often, very often, not only "erring," but " noble."   i5i            ERRING, YET NOBLE.        153 CHAPTER II. A SAINT AMONG SINNERS. IT may be readily imagined that Julia Witherson had cone siderable difficulty in carrying out the details of her strange woman-redemption scheme, and was obliged to resort to stra- tagem, disguise and artifice, so as to keep her work, her labor of purity and love, unknown to the heartless, impure, giddy world of fashion, of which she was A reserved and unwiUing member. It is not, we think, necessary for us to enter into all Me nminute circumstances of our heroine's career, but merely fo give the results of her mission, and to record some of the more striking scenes in which she figured. Her only confidant and assistant was Marvy Barton; and the two women, hand in hand, and heart in unison with heart, went about the streets and lanes of our great city, like the Master of old, " doing good." May it not also be reverently said, " that the Holy Ghost was with them?" In describing our heroine's adventures and experiences, we will simply be guided by the arrangement of time, treat- ing of the events in the order of the date at which they oc- curred. Having described the practical experiences in Book Third, we will take occasion to discourse of the theories con- nected with the subject, and the lessons to be drawn there- from in Book Fourth. We would also insist here upon an all-important point, that every chapter and character in this book is strictly found on fact-is not ideal but real. It so chanced that the first three unfortunates whom Julia chanced to visit were past all earthly power of redemption. Let us, however, glance briefly at these cases. Failures are   164       ERRING, YET NOBLE. e .    I   I  '   i i        !  often as instructive as success. So our heroine found them, and/they but increased her ardor. The first of these women was known to her companions by the name of "Emma." She was a tall, moderately thin, hatrp-featured woman, of about twenty years of age, not bad looking, with fine hair and teeth, and (not an unusual gift in woman) a voluable:tongue. t But her speciality of character, the great feature of her disposition, was a quick termper, which the circumstances ofher life had rendered positively malicious. This malice was principally shown towards the wzen with whom she was brought in contact; towards females she was toler- ably amiable and sociable; but towards all members of the male sex she evinced a degree of malignity not often met with. This, of course, rendered her, spite of her pretty looks, unpopular. Still sle persisted, and, on being reproved by females of her own class for her folly, she would commonly reply, with a fearful oath, " that had it not been for a man she would -not have been what she w:as, and that she was determined to revenge herself upon the whole sex." And she kept her vow. More than one man she had completely ruined, wheedling and fascinating him (she could fascinate when she chose) out of his money, and then abandoning him with scorn. One foolish fellow, who had admired her in the earlier part of her career, she had utterly destroyed in purse and in lionor, halv- ing caused him to rob his -employer to supply the funds for her extravagance. Another, still more foolish, had committed a most violent assault upon a man, of whom he was jealous on her account, and had received the reward of his folly by heavy damages, and a long imprisonment. Truly "Emma" kept her vow. Now, we assure you, reader, that this is zot a fancy sketch, and we ask you is not such a woman as this as dangerous to. men as a tiger let loose in our streets? Is she not more terrible? for tigers cannot ruin reputations and kill souls. Yet this "Emma," this malicious feminine demon, was once s  .         2   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        155 an amiable, confidirig, innocent girl. She mightshaVe been an ornament t;o her own sex and a blessing to some honest man. But she was betrayed,' and her whole life and character was changed. PLeader, we ask you in all honesty, was not the man who first betrayed her really responsible for all the sins she afterwards committed, and for all the sad results,of those sins? Was not this a case in which seduction proved as great a crime as murder? Julia met with this unfortunate, this dangerous woman; she endeavoied to teach her'mercy at least, if ndt purity. 1 But in vain. Our heroine was repulsed, and "Emnma" lived the usual life of "erring sisters," and died at last the usual death of such. And her remains were dishonored by the heartless jests of medical students, and the touch of the dis- secting knife. Thus lived, thus died, the scorning and the scorned woman I "Julia also endeavored to restore to a better and brighter career a woman of a much smore amiable stamp than the one just mentioned. This new acquaintance (if we can be allowed the term) was a very brilliant, pretty girl, tall, black haired, with sparkling black eyes, and an exquisite mouth, which, when she smiled, rendered the expression of her countenance bewitching. Her name was "Fannie," and, like all Fannies- (at least all the Fannies that we have ever met), she was charming. Her disposition was as delightful as her face and manner. She was always obliging, cheerful, generous; she had a fine voice, and ivas always singing ; she had a fine figure, and was passionately addicted to dancing. To her female "friends" (such as they were) she was ever kind and, gentle, and need we say that to men she was irresistible? Our heroine soon learned to love "Fannie," (who could help it?) and ardently did she desire and strive for her reforma- tion. But in vain-all in vain! Strange to say, Fannie loved the life she was leading; she was courted, and flattered, and i sought after; and when she compared her brilliant career   1t6        ERRING, YET NOBLE. with the squalid poverty and the bitter pain that she had endured, as a poor sewing girl, she repined not that she had chosen gay sin in the place of ghastly, shivering, starving virtue. Julia remonstrated, spoke of a future to come, even in this world-a future when beauty would fail; but "Fannie" was like the adder of Scripture, "she would not hear the voice of the charmer, charm it never so wisely," and Julia abandoned the attempt. But Fannie's " future," of which our heroine spoke, did colme (as all "futures" wilD. One night in winter, as the dark waters 6f the North River dashed sullenly against the deserted wharves; as the sleet fell, the wind howled, the heavens were black as fate, and the streets were forsaken by even the police- men; as the rich sat in their splendid parlors' and " thanked God" (or did not thank Him) " that they were not as other men," and the poor crouched shivering by the little fire remain- ing in their stoves ; on this night a female figure was seen (seen by God and the devil, we mean, for there were none else to behold her) to rush hurriedly, desperately along--past the closed stores and the noiseless dwelling-louses, past alike the abodes of luxury and the hovels of misery, past the sleeping city, in fact, until it reached the wharves, the lonely, dismal-looking wharves, and the river, the dark, dismal, cold, roaring, rushing river. Here this female figure stood a moment, shivering with cold, and it. may be with fear; bent over the wharf and gazed into the waters, then rushed backwards a pace, then gave a glance of despair upwards to the heavens which frowned upon her, looked around upon the darkness and beyond to the far-off lamps of the city, looked around for the last time. Then, with a sound escaping from her wretched soul through her pallid lips, a sound, part shriek, part curse, and part, let us trust, a prayer, the miserable "Fannie " threw herself into the -rushing waters of the deep and ice-cold river. Yes, it is true, the face was disfigured with small-pox (as those who found her corpse some time afterwards discovered), it is also true, that the body bore the marks of premature decay,   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         157 that not a vestige of beauty was left. Nevertheless the corpse was that of the once lovely, caressed, courted, gay, amiable, beautiful "Fannie." The Fannie whom Julia Witherson had vainly endeavored to save. We doubt not that in Pandemonium the devils held upon this night high carnival over the lost soul that 'had arrived among them. While in Heaven the angels of God shed tears, over the awful and hopeless death of an "erring sister 1" Let us follow Julia Witherson still further in her good, though, oftentimes, fruitless work. It is a bare, cheerless-looking room. The apartment is of considerable size (for a garret), and is utterly destitute of the slightest sign of comfort. The ceiling is composed of rough boards, and the walls are covered with the cheapest paper, which is as dirty as it is cheap. The floor is bereft of carpet, unless a bit of rag here and there can be called by that name. The furniture consists of a common table (on which lies a brandy bottle and a soiled tumbler), a broken washstand, and the most dismal-looking bed imaginable, covered with scanty and foul linen. The only decorations are, an ugly window-screen, which is torn in half, and a low picture supported against the dirty wall by a rusty nail. Such is the room which is situated at the head of a long, narrow, rickety-, dark, filthy flight of stairs, and in one of the vilest dens in the city. The window of the apart. ment looks down upon a little court, from whence an occasional curse is wafted to the unwilling ear; the only pure thing that is to be seen bein(g a bit of blue sky overhead. A close, damp odor is also to be experienced, which is intensely disagreeable. Good God I what a contrast is all this to the sumptuous dwell- ings of the rich; what a contrast is all this to the delicious isights, sounds and scents of the glorious country I The occupants of this miserable room at the present hour are two. One is Julia Witherson, trembling inwardly somewhat, and disguised as much as possible, but, nevertheless, uumistak- ably " the lady ;" with her holy purpose lending dignity to her  Yl I Vrrvv         ir   t1^        ERRING, YET NOBLE. look and manner. The other is the proprietress of this horrible apartment; a being who was undoubtedly at one time a young woman, but who is now but little more than a prematurely aged and most disgusting remnant of humanity. She is short, stout, ugly, filthy, with a blotched face, teeth nearly black, sunken cheeks, large, hideous mouth, the coarsest possible neck and shoulders, large hands, large, ungainly feet; a figure ut-terly devoid of grace, and eyes full of rum and'villainy. Her dress is as ugly, dirty and coarse as herself; it is nothing but a buti- dle of rags, which scarcely answer the purposes of decency; in fact, do not answer them. And the life which this woman has for years been leading, and the associations she has kept, have been on a par with her garb and appearance. The dirty lanes and alleys are her world, the night is her day, the low tavern and saloon are her church and Sundav-school, brandy has been her inspiration, and thieves and women as deglraded as herself have been her only friends. God liave mercy upon her, and the tens of thousands like her I Julia strives to reclaim her. She uses every arg(ument, every influence that can be brought to bear upon such a wretched,  fallen creature. "Leave this place," pleads our heroine, " leave this horrible place. I will send you to a decent and colfort- able loding, and you shall have work that is honest, and will pay you better than the vile life you now lead, and which is killing you fast."' But the woman laughs, and takes a long "pull" at the brandy-bottle. She is evidently bent upon becoming intoxi- cated, and is succeeding in her design. "Give me that cursed poison," cries Julia, advancing and seizing the bottle, with the intention of throwing it out of the window. But the woman prevents her, and, laughing agail, takes another draught, and empties it. "Poison-why, that is brandy. My man gave it to me last right. I could not live without brandy v The case is hopeless. Julia sees that it is so.

Her praver is nearly the same which the Saviour uttered eighteen hundred years ago : "Father, forgive her, for she knows not what she doeth." But a step is heard upon the stairs. It comes nearer, louder; a drunken man enters ; a professional "thief," "the man" of "the woman," who occupies this apartment. He is a coarse, filthy, depraved, utterly vicious. being. Julia, at the very sight of him, shudders with disgust, not unmixed with fear, and de- parts immediately.  Yet, strange to say, (and yet why "strange?" nothing can be " strange" in woman-nature) this drunken, ugly, lost creature, whose hIome is this abominable den, loves this vile thief. Really loves him, and would steal, murder, beg or die for him; has, in fact, time and again, sold her soul for one smile from his low, vulgar, profane lips. Reader, you have perused, we p)resume, the pages of that great novel called 1"Oliver Twist," and you remember the story of Nancy and Bill Slykes.

ONB morning, Julia Witherson, on her way down Broad- way, entered an art gallery to examine a painting. While there she was struck with the appearance of one of the few visitors, who, at that comparatively early hour, happened to be present-a young woman of not more than twenty-five years of age, with a very sweet, modest face. One by one the visitors departed, and at last Julia and this young w6man who had so attracted her attention, alone remained. Our heroine happening  to drop something which the young woman happened to pick up and return to her, a few polite words were interchanged ; from these a casual conver- sation arose, and Julia soon became quite interested in her new acquaintance. Not many days after our parties atain nmet, spoke and conversed. To make a long story short, they soon became friends. The name of Julia's new friend was Winder ;  she was of respectable, though middle-class paren- tage, and had two sisters considerably younger than herself, both of whom were quite pretty girls. The three sisters were named respectively, the eldest (Julia's friend) Emma, the next Janet, and the youngest one Ellen. Ellen and Janet were siAters, but Emmr a was but a step-sister, being the only child of her father's first wife. Our heroine visited several times the family (though they did not belong to the same sphere -as herself), and subsequently became, in course of years, cognizant, directly or indirectly, of those various facts in the life-histories of the three girls which we will now pro. ceed to lay before our readers. Mr. Winder's first wife (Emma's mother) was one of the   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        161 very best of mothers, and of wives. To her husband she had been all that a loving partner could be, and to her daughter she had been a fond, faithful, watchful, pains-taking teacher, guardian and example. She attended alike to the bodily, social, intellectual and spiritual needs of her child ; watched over the morals as well as the mind; brought her daughter up sensibly as well as religriously-; cultivated both her heart and her head. The almost necessary consequence followed. Emma learned to love and to practice these virtues which her darling mother so well exemplified. She became a sensi- ble, affectionate, good, pure girl; and although the first Mrs.  X  Winder was soon taken from earth, she had so effectually sown the good seed in her child's heart, that Emma never forgot her early lessons. Soon after the death of his first wife, Mr. Winder married again ; but his choice this time was unfortunate. The second Sirs. Winder was a showy but vulgar woman, with but little heart, head or principle. She neglected her family and launched into a course of third-rate dissipation. By her, Mr. Winder had two children, Janet and Ellen, who were suffered to grow up carelessly educated, unwatched, and without any restraint or moral training. Need we say that these two neglected girls became, in after life, two unhappy women? But we will descend more into detail. THE HAPPY DAUGHTER OF A GOOD MOTHER. Emma Winder, from a good, lovely girl, soon expanded into a sweet-looking, amiable and virtuous woman. Her smile had a peculiar charmn in its wooing gentleness, and her eye was a beautiful exponent of her pure soul. After her father's second marriage she soon observed with sorrow the difference between this second parent and her own revere'd mother. When her two step-sisters were born, and neglected, Emma made it her great object in life to endeavor, as far as she could, by her own loving care, to supply the deficiencies of their careless parent, but without'any good result; for   162        ERRING, YET, NOBLE. when the dlder members of a family set a pernicious example it is generally vain for a y1nzior to endeavor to check the evil. Stil], Emmra fulfilled her duty, satisfied her conscience, and compelled the respect of the household. And she did more than this; she succeeded ill winning the love of a most esti- mable young man, a mechanic, an industrious and skillful Nworkmnan, who possessed the esteem and the confidence of his employers. Mrs. Winder, the second, opposed the union of the parties, and told Emma that "she ought to look higher" (third-rate people always have a false ambition--a foolish, restless desire to rise above the sphere in which they were born). But Miss Winder was as wise as sloe was good; she respected the young man for his integrity and industry. She soon learned to love him for his many noble qualities. She married him. She looked most beautifully in her bridal dress, and, we doubt not, the spirit of her mother hovered near the marriage altar, rejoicing in the happiness of her child. The young couple " commenced life in a small way," but gradually their fortunes rose. They rose with their for- tunes, and they are now, in every sense of that expressive term, "doing well" in the world. Truly, even in this life virtue and common sense reap their reward. Truly, also, immeasurable in its results is a mother's influence I THE WRETCHED DAUGHTER OF A CARELESS MOTHER. The elder of Emma's step-sisters, Janet, was a very pretty, showy girl, rather tall and slender, finely-formed, with dark eyes and hair, a rich color and a bright smile ; a beautiful smile, in fact, seemed to be one of the characteristics of the whole family. Her hands, arms and feet were exquisite, her movements were graceful. Her taste in dress was capital, though it inclined somewhat to the "gaudy," and decidedly to the." expensive." Her language, too, was well chosen, and her natural, mental and moral capabilities were large. But alas I they were not improved either-by her mother or herself. Janet was suffered to grow up neglected, though   ERRING^ YET NOBLE.        16 petted. She received but little moral or religious training; her mental education was made a matter of comparatively no moment; and as to household matters she was left +in complete ignorance. It is astonishing how little young girls, and especially girls of the middle and lower classes, know now-a-days of those home, house duties which are a woman's peculiar province! But what else could be expected in Janet when her mother knew as little as herself? when this mother preferred coarse, vulgar, though- showy dissipations to home duties and home comforts? Is it a wonder that Janet learned to love what so delighted her parent? Is it at all astonishin(g that she preferred " promenading^" in the day-time, and "I balls," "social parties," "sociables," and "theatres" in the night time, to baking, reading, or to church- going? We think not. At any rate, all this came to pass ; and Janet, spite of the remonstrances of her older step-sis- ter, having made at a " ball" the acquaintance of a hand- some but worthless young fellow, accepted his attentions. As her father would not conse!nt to their union, she "ran off" with him, in a romantic, but most nonsensical manner, and married, with the connivance, of her mother, the object of her foolish and fleeting attachment. "Fleeting" we say, for after marriage, when it was too late, (how is it that ninety. nine women out of a hundred never find men out until it " is too late?") Janet discovered her rlistake. She learned at last that she was the wife of a man not worthy of the name. But-it was no time for repentance, but for suffering. The once showy, gay, handsome, Janet soon became the slatternly, morose, faded wife, and, in course of time, the " cross" mother. Hardly a vestige of her former self remained; even " her smile" had lost its chief charm, for it wars, alas I no longer "bright." She lived a wretched, and she died a useless and despairing woman. Immeasurable truly, in its results, is a mother's influence! , *                      - *' ,    164        ERRING, YET NOBLE. THE BAD DAUGHTER OF. A BAD MOTHER. But sad as Janet's fate was, the life-history of Ellen Winder, the youngest of the three sisters, was by far the more mournful, tragic, aye, horrible. Ellen Winder was a rather stout but very showy girl, more showy, in point of fact, than her sister. She was about the same height as Janet, but more fleshy, and was very fine-looking. Her hair was lighter than her sister's, her eyes were larger, her face fuller, and her smile 'even more beautiful. Her taste in dress was decidedly bad, however, inclining to the " flashy" and "outre ;" her voice was always pitched in a high and rather unpleasant key; and her manners were boisterous and hoydenish. She was of a very lively dis- position, fond ofexcitement, and her nature and parts, though on the whole good, required careful discipline and constant watchfulness. The very requisites that her mother would not comply with. As a necessary consequence, therefore, the evil in Ellen's character soon developed itself at the expense of the good, and at last the daughter fell a victim to the negligence of the mother. Of course we do not- mean to infer that the mother was directly responsible for every evil that befell Ellen in her after life. Daughters are free agents as well as mothers. ZBut we do mean to say that if a parent does what Mrs. Winder did; if a mother allows her daughter to go wherever she pleases, to receive company of whose character she knows nothing; to make no inquiries as to the manner in which her child passes her time, gives her no religious instruction, sets her an example of folly, and then when her daughter commits error abandons the unfortunate to the world, we do mean to say that this mother is one direct cause of her child's ruin, perhaps the chiefest cause, and will be judged as such. Let us look at five successive scenes in the life-drama of Ellen Winder. The Promenade. It is the twilight hour of a lovely summer's evening, and over the heated streets of the city a delicious cool haze is overspread. A young man is standing in front of his father's residence, smok- Va   ERBBRIN  YET NOBLE.        165 ing a cigar, and at intervals humming an opera air. A young girl passes, a very pretty girl; she catches the young man's eye, and though a perfect stranger to him, smiles most bewitchingly. Somewhat astonished, but still more pleased (our young man "has traveled," evidently), he follows her, keeping at a suffi- cient distance to escape observation from the neighbors and those in the street. The young girl looks back occasionally evidently aware that the young man is gaining upon her ; but she is neither agitated nor alarmed. At last, seizing, a fitting moment, the young man advances and addresses her.   Yes, thougch he is apparently a " gentleman," and she is a perfect stranger to him, he dares to accost her in the public street, and she does not indignantly repel him, but replies to his remark. Encouraged, the young man walks at her-side, and enters with her into a lively conversation. Before the parties separate, Ellen Winder, for it is she, absolutely gives her name and resi- dence to the impertinent stranger, who absolutely makes an appointment with iher to call at her home the next evenillng, and take her upon a moolight excursion I   Oh"! tempora! Oh! mores! It is a fact, startling as it may sound to our lady readers, that many an acquaintanceship is formed every day in our large cities in just such a way as the one we hlave just narrated--ac quaintanllceships which lead to ruin. We know of several cases i so-called " respectable " families, where young men visit the female members on intimate terms whlo lhave had no introduction save that which their own impertinence and the folly of the young women afforded them. The Excursion. It is a lovely noon in the early part of the motth of Septem- ber, an'd in one of the loveliest rural spots in the environs of /New York. A youthful pair are sauntering slowly amidst the trees that line a stream. The youngc man is devoted, and the young woman evidently flattered, if not enraptured; He is ardent, full of protestation, adoration, aall a lover's extrava-   166        ERRING, YET NOBLE. gance; she listens with pleased vanityv, at least, if nothing more. Tihe day is most delicious. The sky is cloudless (unless you call those beautiful vapors scattered here and there over the blue face of the sky, lending an additionlal charm to it, as a dimple does to a maiden's chill, unless you call these "clouds "), and the air is balmy. All the glory of the vanished summer is't? be seen and felt, but the excessive heat that mars July and August has departed. The woods are gorgeous, a nd the strea m meallders on like a'watery poem. , But the day and scene are forgotten by oui youthful pair, whlo know, see and experience but each other. The younlg man is handsome, gentlemanly-look- ing, elegant; the girl is finlely formed, rather stout, tall, showy, with large eyes, and a nioust bewitclling smile. You would know her anywhere- by that smile. OlNce seen, it is lolng to be remem- bered. And her companion assures her that he will never forget it. And on the assurance she smiles again. 'Tis a poetic time, -and love is a poetic thing. But love is not always what it seems. Love is not -always true. It has many counterfeits which lure a woman to destruction. Time passes on.

And all the manifold dissipations of a city are ili fuill last. The rumsellers' are doing a lucrative busi- ness ; the restaurlant-keepers are gladdened by the disappear-, ance of innumerable viands down the capacious throats of a glut- tonous multitude ; the hotel steps are crowded ; the streets are thronged ; the theatres are full ; the cigar stores are well patron- ized ; the gambling houses are rejoicing ; tthe police are asleep ; the churches are closed, or, if open, are empty ; and the concert saloons display their transparencies. It is to the interior of one of these concert saloons that we now invite the reader's imaogination to follow us. Let thie reader be thankful tlat -he is obliged to follow us only in imagination. Exteriorly,* the building is large, well lighted, and ,a num- ber of highly fanciful and gaudy sign-boards are displayed around the entrance.  Within, the auditorium is of great size; capable of accommodating, in fact, far too many people.   But the seats are plain and uncomfortable ; the walls are dirty and bare ; the floor is nearly related to the walls in these respects; and there is a general lack of taste visible in all the arrarnge- 1ents of the establishment. The stage is large, but the scenery and appointments -are of the simplest, coarsest, and clieapest character ; while the performances are of a most curiously- diversified and vulgar description.  The programme atones in * NOTE.-The concert saloons of Philadelphia were, until recently, even more prominent institutions of that city than are the metropolitan concert saloon. o New York itself.

After all there is but little apparent and no real diff rence between conce'rt saloons iu any and every of our large cities.   168        iERBb, YET NOBLE. quantity for its lack in quality, the management believing in the maxims of the Bowery theatres. Dancing, not of the most artistic, and certainly not of the most- decent kind ; singing, in which noise seems to be the principal ingredient; burlesques, in  which vulgarity is mistaken for wit; comic songs and jests of utmost grossness ; gymnastic feats, etc., etc.; these, without a single feature of real merit, form the staple of the evening's entertainment. The audience comprise all varieties of men and boys ; and, alas I but one variety of women, and that the lowest. Thile moa- jority of females present, however, appear in the capacity, not of spectators, but of " waiters," called, by a polite fiction, "pretty waiter girls." These women are busily employed receiving and fulfilling orders for the various liquors which are liberally, dis- pensed at the " bar," which is located near the entrance. This sale of liquor to boys, and this dispensing of it by the agency of young women, is the great feature and the prime curse of the so- called concert saloons of our large cities. We might here take an opportunity to moralize ; but we for- bear, and leave all that we might say to the reader's own sug- gestions. Suffice it to remark that, if King Satan ever was to be found on earth, you would be most likely to come across him in a concert saloon. Near the bar is located the " cigar stand," wfihere very poor tobacco is sold at very high prices. And here, while- the " or- chestra" are making all the discord possible, under the impression that they are producing melody, a number of young men are to be found talking to a very pretty girl, whose business is to wear a low-necked dress, to smile (which she does most bewitchingly), to " take a social glass" with whoever invites her, and to use every art to sell her cigars at as great a profit as possible. The girl is certainly very good looking, and we think that we have seen her face before. We are not mistaken. It is the young girl who allowed a young man to force her acquaintance in the public street one summer's evening; has been betrayed by her lover; discovered by her parents; discarded by them (strange ,                 * +   ;I' E-'          .RINO, YEoT OBLE.         169 to say, parents who neglect their offspring are always the most- severe toward them in case of " anything going wrong"), and who has now become a reckless, careless " waiter girl" at a con- cert saloon. Her elder sister lEmma, now happily married, has inlvain endeavored to bring Nellie back from the road she is traveling; Nellie is determined to go onward and downward- and she goes. There she sits, smiles, drinks bad brandy, laughs and listens to evil language. Occasionally an expression not unlike an oath escapes from her beautiful lips, and then she smiles again. i Meanwhile, the half-dressed ballet girls are perpetrating all sorts of attitudes ; the orchestra is committing all varieties of musical atrocities; the men are smoking, drinking, swearing, talking ob- scenity; the boys in the gallery are imitating, in an humble way, the vices of those beneath them, and there sits Nellie W'in- der-lost Nellie Winder-with her smiles, her beauty, and her recklessness. Her betrayer enters-and approaches her; but she heeds him not. He has become indifferent to her, and she to him-neither party is capable of a lastingc love. Meanwhile witlhthe limits of the same city that holds her lost child, that faithful mother, Nellie's mother, is at a ball. Her husband, who finds no satisfaction at home, takes to drinking, and will soon we fear, become a confirmed drunkard. Oh, truly, the influ- ence of a mother is immeasurable, whether for good or evil I But there is a " hereafter, and there is a God-and that God will be a judge hereafter! Shame. It is in a house-an evil house-in our American Babylon, New York; that-city of open vice and unmitigated scoundrel- ism; that city of extremes, of Fifth Avenue and Five Points, of Barnum and Beecher ; that metropolis of thieves 'and of fashion, of fine art and infamous artifice, of the "Cooper Institute " and of " concert saloons ;" it is in an evil house in this evil city that we now for at moment enter--but, thank God, but in imagina- tion! Amongst the wretched inmates of this abominable, but    170        ERRING, YET NOBLE. comfortable and fashionable establishment, is a young girl, who is the most reckless, noisy, and dissipated woman in the house. She is rather tall, quite stout, firmly formed, very showy, quite pretty, dresses very gaudily and not in good taste, has a, rather shrill voice, and a most bewitching smile-a smile which is her great attraction. She is very gay, fond of excitement, endeav- ors in every conceivable way to banish thought, drinks, gam- bles, dances, and spends money in every imaginable manner. Her life is a carnival of sin. And her assumed name is .Louise, bnut her real name is-Nellie-Nellie Winder. Shle has come to this at last. Another victim has been added to the list-a vic- tim to man's baseness, but, above all, to a ntwler's legiigence and evil example. Ah I thou careless, wicked mother I Who will answer for thy soul's salvation. when thou standest at the judgment-seat of Christ? Suffering.  It is a miserable hovel in that hell upon earth (which is still a hell despite the efforts made to improve its condition), the "Five Points." The night is starless, the wind is cold, and the hovel is destitute of every comfort and of coal. There is no light, no fire; and a man-a drunken man, and a woman-a drunken woman, are quarreling. The man swears a horrible oath, and knocks the woman down, though she is endeavoring to pacify him by a smile, which is still beautiful, though the face has- lost its former loveliness. Heaven have mercy upon us, we have seen that smile before. Ys; and we have seen it upon the lips of Nellie Winder, alia ouisse alias a dozen other names. She has gradually descended in the scale, until she has become: the poor, uogly, worthless, dirty wretch she now is, with naught remaining of her former self, except a vestige of her former smile. She is damned socially, pecuniarily, personally, and spiritually. And, like thousands of others in her condition, she is but an example of the evil results of an evil mother.. ; .  o    ERRING, YET NOBLE.       171 CH-APTER- IV.  A PHILOSOPHCAL SINNER. DURING her investigations and salvations, if we may use the term, our heroine became acquainted with " an unfortunate," whose assumed name was Alice Maltravers. .The history of this woman is worthy of some attention. At the age of ninieteen she found herself poor, firiendless, alone in the worid, and pretty. No, " pretty" is not the term, but intellectual-looking, striking' in appearance, not unlikto our heroine herself in personal characteristics. She was tall and queenly, and so luxuriant was her form, so superbly rich was its magnificent outline, that those who gazed upon it once would be contented almost to gaze forever. Her features were not of the ' regular " order of beauty, and yet there was such an expression of soul pervading them, there was such a charml in the fascination of their eloquent mobi- lity, that many a "belle" would gladly have exchanged places with her. Her eye, too, was superb; a dark, deep, delicious organ, which would have given a poet all the inspi- ration that lie needed. Her hlair was lonlg, dark, luxuriant; her lhands and feet as fine as human feet and hands could be, As to her mental powers they were of a higher order than the averag e. Her education had been limited, but her pow- ers of observation (which is more than education) were natur- ally great, and had been constantly employed. Her peculiar intellectual feature was her fondness for literature. She was a greedy reader, and not only so, she possessed as well apti- tude as affection for literary pursuits. Her sphere was im- agination, and in all imaginative works she-topk an intense delight; and she could not only read appreciatingly, but   1723       E;RBINGj YET NOBLE. could also reproduce. As regards her spiritual matters, her religious training had been even more limited than her education. Her creed was certainly not " orthodox," and at 'the age of nineteen she found herself in the wide world alone, a woman, one of that sex which has few opportunities to rise, and many to fall. For a while she sought employment (emlployment for either hands or head), sought it, as Esau did repentance, " carefully and with tears," but she found. it not. It seemed as though all avenues of labor or profession were closed against her ; that is, all avenues of remunerative labor, labor that would keep her in comfort, that would give her leisure for her mental life, that life of reading, thinking and writing, which was to her a positive need. She could gain work enough to keep her body from starvation, but what of that, the mind has an existence as necessary as that of the body. Men could find work, pleasant and profitable work, work that will occupy and fill the mind, but a woman must either sew in a garret, or starve in a cellar ; and in either case her intellect must perish. So at last she formed a resolution-a resolution not adopted in excitement, but based upon (as she deemed) philosophical reasoning-a reso- lution to live comfortably and intellectually in vice, as she could not exist so in virtue-a determination to earn the sufficient "wages of sin" rather than to starve in mind as well as body upon the insufficient rewards of " honest indus, try." In other words, she had presented to herself, at the age of nineteen, two paths in life-the one the road to interg- rity, more consonant to her natural goodness, but conducting through sorrow, toil, cold and hunger, watchings, intellec- tual pauperism, rags and squallor, to consumption and an early grave. The other the path of vice, dishonorable it is true, but then so flowery, leading, through revellin g and pleasure, to comparative wealth and intellectual opportuni- ties. Of the two roads she chose the latter--chose it on apparently philosophical principles; and, to tell the truth, if there was no other world than this, we could almost admikie                  .,   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        173 her philosophy. She reasoned thus : "If I work as women work, a bare, barren competence is the most that I can hope for. I may not obtain even this, and be driven by necessity to crime at last. At any rate, my nobler powers, my intel- lectual gifts, will be worthless to myself; I will have neither the means nor the time to indulge them; I must be a mere beast of burden, a human machine, must be scorned by the rich, scorned as though I were, indeed, a sinner.  For among the virtuous it is a sin to be penniless; whereas, if I do " err," I will be scorned no more than were I!pare and poor. I shall have comfort, and, what is more, have time-- time to read, study, write and enjoy life, for years at least. Then when my charms desert me, and my lovers depart, why it is a cheap and simple thing to die by poison, the river, or the rope. And death is but an eternal sleep, or if not, no matter; it must be borne, and cannot be avoided." Thus she reasoned, and upon this reasoning she acted, and was soon provided well f(or in a neat little house in the wes- tern part of the city where our heroine visited her. The house itself was a very respectable-looking affair, not large, it is true, but very cozy. Everything about the exte. rior was preserved in a state of scrupulous cleanliness, and the interior was the very picture of comfort. The hall wax neatly papered and carpeted; the small parlor "was decorated with a fine mirror and several choice pictures, and a piano, of the very best make, added its attractions. Back of the parlor was a comfortable room fitted-up for a "library."' In short, the whole establishment, including the servant, was "t capital." What a change firom the garret, which would hlave been-the portion of Alice Maltravers had slihe been a poor, but virtuous woman! Do not censure us for drawing this contrast between the external surroundings of vice and virtue. We but paint truly.  But censure, if you will, society that permits this contrast. In this comparatively elegant home Alice enjoyed life, and devoted her leisure time (of which she had an abundance)    174        ERRTNG), YET NOBLE. to reading, to music, of which she had some knowledge, and to literature, to reading and to writing. Had she not chosen well! Was' not this life more delightful, more intellectual, more philosophical, than virtuously sewing for eighteen hours per day for the enormous sum of a few shillings? Our heroine, who had now become a pretty accurate judge Oofhuman nature, soon appreciated the character of Alice Maltravers (who, by-the-by, certainly did not resemble the Alice of Bulwer's great noveD. And in her attempts at the reformation of Alice, Julia devoted her energies to conrvinciug her new acquaintance of the " error of her ways" by practi- cal arguments, directed to her religion, her philosophy, her literary views, her common sense and worldly knowledge. Alice had become a sinner on philosophical, literary and prac- tical grounds, and on these she must be saved, or on nothing. So Julia, both directly and indirectly, preached and proved the truth of a pure, just and merciful religion ; proved the existence of a God, who was at once a Judge and a Redeemer-- proved a Heaven and a hell for the good and for the evil ; and thus demonstrated that vice and irreligion were great practi- cal mistakes when the next world was takerinto consideration. Julia Witherson also proved, in the most satisfactory way possible, i. e., by practical demonstration, that there were other avenues open to women of strong minds, besides sin or starva- tion. She spoke of the efforts being made in behalf of female labor throlugout the Christian world ; she showed how thought- ful men and earnest women were daily agitating this matter; and, more than all, she offered a chance of honest and suffi- ciently remunerative employment to Alice herself. Julia also encouraged Alice in her literary pursuits ; offered to give her increased intellectual facilities, and to use her influ- ence to secure a favorable perusal of the MSS. of her work. For Alice Maltravers, degraded as she was, morally, was yet an authoress; and an authoress, too, of considerable merit. Talent is by no means confined to virtue. And at last, by all the means mentioned above, and by the     ERRING, YET NOBLE.        175 blessing of Heaven upon them, Julia rescued Alice 'from the paths of error, and brought her in triumph unto virtue. We need not go into detail. Suffice it to say that Alice Matravers'took a new name, and lead a new and strictly vir- tuous life. Her days were devoted to fulfilling the -duties of a responsible position in an establishment (which Julia's influence had procured her), and her nights were -spent in preparing for publication her MSS., which consisted of a sort of diary, worked into the form of a novel of considerable power and originality. Nothing, ever transpired of her former life; she became re- spected; and, at last, to a certain extent, even famous. For Julia, interesting herself in the matter, through her friend, the Rev. George Howard, obtained a publisher for Alice's work, which became "a success," pecuniarily as well as otherwise, and enabled the authoress to live independently of her business posi- tion in the establishment above referred to. And in course of time, the once erring "Alice Maltravers" became the well- known literateur, moving. in good society, esteemed by all who ever met her.   176     -   ERRINO, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER V. THE MOTHER AND HER CHLD. IT is late in the afternoon, and in a room ill a house situate on a quiet, retired street, two women are conversing; one of whom is evidently a "lady," though disg;uised in a common garb. In short, it is Julia Witherson. The room, located upon the ground floor, is not large, biti neatly and conveniently furnished. Everything, however, is in disorder; hardly a single piece of furniture is in its proper place, and articles of wearing apparel are scattered in confusion over the apartment. The proprietress is decidedly careless, as she certainly is most decidedly beautiful. For a prettier woman than Julia's companion, at the present moment, it would be difficult to find. She is tall, and very slender. Her shape is exquisite, and her waist as delicious a sight to see and as delighlltful a thing to clasp, as any object one could meet with in a year's travel. ' Her arm, now bare, is white as snow, rounded gloriously, soft and sufficiently plump; a man could wish to be embraced by naught more charming. Her foot and ankle, which peep out from the somewhat scant folds of her dress, are as tiny as they are ex. quisite. Her bust is most captivating ; her neck and shoulders are purer than ivory and ten times more bewitching. Her com- plexion, spite of the paint with which it is disfigured, could not be improved in its delicate tints of red and white. Her face is so child-like, yet so womanly; so regular, and yet so expressive, that neither-painter or poet could desire better study or sweeter subject. Her hair is long, ificlined to cur], though worn straight. and is dark but not black. Her forehead is high and unmarred as yet by a wrinkle ; her eyebrows long and exquisitely pen. cilled. Her eyes are not large, and one would be puzzled to tell   iBRINGt, YET NOBLE.         1" their exact color, as their hue seems to vary as often as their expression. Her mouth is not small, not large, but wholly in# describable in its mobility, and altogether delicious in the ripe, red richness of its lips. While her nose, that generally unpoetic feature, in her case but adds an additional charm ; and her chin is beautifully rounded and also dimpled. Altogether, Julia's companion is a lovely creature, far too lovely to be what, alas I she is. But her story is as old as the everlasting hills, a story that has been told since the creation of the world, and will have to be re-told, we fear, until the end of time. She had been young, innocent, imprudent; a man had been daring and cun- ning, specious and heartless; he tempted, and she fell; she trusted, and he betrayed ; he abandoned her, and she became an abandoned woman. And, alas I a drunken woman also. Oh, reader,"if it has never fallen to your lot to see a young and lovely woman, de- based, degraded, under' the influence of that enemy of human peace which men call wine, thank God for it; for you have escaped a most horrible spectacle. And now this lovely but lost being, whom Julia has met, is now visiting, and is endeavoring to save, opens her beautiful lips. What, think you, issues from them? They are lips made to praise God with and to make a loving mati happy-they are lips formed for kisses, but alas alas! they only utter, curses. Reader, be thankful to Heaven for many things, but be especially grate. ful if it has fallen to your lot never to hear a lovely, drunken woman swear! Julia looks, listens, and shudders. The blush of shame man- ties upon her cheek at this picture of the degradation of her sex. Shle endeavors to speak words of reproof and of good ; but she sees plainly that now is not the proper season. With a heart full .of sorrow, she takes her departure for the present, determined to call and strive again at some fitter opportunity. And the beautiful, lost, drunken, profane Emeline retires to her couch to sleep away the poison within her veins.   178        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Time passed on, and Julia visited Ermeline a number of times. But all her holy and earnest efforts seemed to be in vain. IAt one time she would appeal to religion-to the fears of an here- after state, to the terrors of conscience and the fear of death. But Emeline was proof against all these impressions; her soul was seared ; she was "joined to her idols." At another time our heroine would dilate to her guilty companion upon, the goodness and the mercy of a loving Redeemer, and endeavor to lead the sinner to the shadow of the Cross ; but this effort would prove equally vain. On a third occasion Julia would make some practical suggestion of good, or appeal to the com- mon sense and true worldly interest of her companion ; but Eme- line responded not even -to this. And our heroine began to despair. It seemed as though the object of her solicitude was wholly given over by a relentless fate to the powers of darkness; that her certain doom was a life of shame and a death of despair; as though it was written that she should be forever lost. But one day an unexpected incident performed in an hour the good work of years. One afternoon Julia determines to .pay her last visit to the beautiful Emreline, and accordingly wends her way to the quiet, seemingly respectable street on which the house in which our fair sinner has her room is silnated. She is admitted by the servant, an old negro woman, who recognizes in her, as she thinks, a friend of her lodger. The door of the apartment, which, as we before remarked, was located upon the ground floor, is open, and Julia is about entering, when she is arrested upon the threshold  by a sight as beautiful as unexpected. 'Upon the floor, sitting in an attitude of indescribable, inimitable, be- cause utterly unconscious grace ; clad in a loosely-fitting robe, which exquisitely displays her charms of person, with her rounded arms, neck, and shoulders, and her delicate feet bare; her hair carelessly curling, and streaming down her back,; her face now free from paint, and full of an expression of love and almost inno- cence; -her eyes full of beauty and (a rare thing, alas!) of purity, sits the Emeline she had  come to seek. Ermeline   ERRING, YRT NOBLE.         179 no longer with alcoholic poison in her veins and curses upon her lips, but " in her right mind," pressing ceaseless, passionate, yet playful kisses upon the responding lips of a beautiful little child, a girl of some four years of age, who is sitting upon the floor beside her, and in all the innocent glee of childhood, laughing in -the midst of her companion's embraces. And Emeline bestows lavishy upon the child many a kiss and clasp which the proud- est monarch on earth mighlt envy, calling the child by every en- dearing epithet. It is a lovely sifght, especially when you take into consideration one of the parties. Emeline does not now seem what, alas I we know her to be. She looks like a loving, inno- cent mother, sporting with her lovely and innocent child. And such, all save the innocence on her part, is the relationship be- tween the parties. Emeline is the mother of this child, as she herself tells Julia, when she discovers her presence. And this affection for the pure offspringo of her guilty love, is the one spark of Heaven still burningn amidst the blackness of darkness of the mother's soul. It is the one ray of true womanhood which yet shines amid all degradation. Believe us, reader, there are such sparks and rays burning and shining in the depths of even the nmost polluted woman's soul-if we would but take the trouble, first, to search for them, next to fan them, by our earnest labors, into a holy light of true repentance. Julia has now her cue. A new opportunity is presented, and she avails herself of her opportunity. She seeks to save the mother by the child. She strives to reach the woman's soul through the mother's heart. For your child's sake," pleads our heroine of her companion, "for the sake of that little girl whom  you love so truly, be a better woman and a truer mother. As you value that darling little innocent whom  you kiss and fondle, for whom  you would doubtless die, leave the life you are now leading, and become a mother of whom   her child need not hereafter be ashamed." Emeline listens, and folds her child to her bosom; that child so innocent, so lovely, so loving, who timidly looks with its bea. -   180        ERRIXG, YET STOBLE. tifil eyes-so like its young mother's-at the stranger. And Julia continues: "Would you have your daughter become hereafter what you yourself now are? No ; I see you blush, and shudder, and fold your child more tightly to your breast, as though to shield, it from such a fearful possibility. But, I tell you, it is not only a possibility, but a probability, aye, an almost certainty, unless you yourself become the guardian of your chld. For the sake - of your little daughter's virtue, and her immorttal sou!, Emeline, dear Emeline (for you are dear to me, and to One above wlho never made such lovely things as you to perish), become that which you should be, but that which, alas! you are not.:" "And which I never can be," replied' Emeline. "Which I was once before I knew her father," pointing to her child, "but which-I can never be again."  And she presses pasisonate kisses upon the pure cheek of her child-daughter. "Oh, say not so," rejoins Julia, earnestly, ' say not so. It is never too late. Learn of your child. Become pure, as she is-- pure in the future, if not in the past. -Be as pure as was your own dead nlother." The last sentence was said at a venture, as Jalia had learned but little of her companion's history-but it told. It went to her listener's heart. "If you regard but your dalgrhter's life in this world, if you value but her health, her happiness, her comfort, forsake your; present career; accept the chance that I have so often offered' you, and you so often refused. But there is more in this world than even this life, and you know it--you feel it. Suppose your child were dead now in your arms," (the mother shuddered, and then her lovely eyes filled with tears at the bare thought of such a death), "-suppose, I say, your child were but a corpse in your very embrace.  It were better so than that she should live to be what her mother has been.  Yet she will live to become thus worse than dead unless you change your life. For God's sake, for your own sake, for my sake, for your gone mother's sake, and for the more than life of your innocent daughter, your little   '   ,ERRINSO, YET NOBLE.                  181. daughter there, who looks so wonderingly upon us, have mercy upon yourself-and become what I now ask you to be for thle last time." Agitated by this impassioned appeal, agitated as she has not been for years, her soul full of emotions which have long, been strangers, the beautiful Emeline, with a tear glistening in her eye, arises, with her child in her arms, and advancing toward the willdow, raises partially the curtain. As she does so, a lait, long gleam of the afternoon sunlight falls in its beauty uponCh mother and the child-the sweet but sinful mother, and the not more sweet, but sinless child. And Julia exclaims : "'See, Emeline, dear Eraeline, Heaven smiles upon you--and upon your chiild. The pure sunllight is upon you. See! your cliild smiles on you in trust and confidence. Let it not be dis- appointed. Let the light be in yourl heart as well as on yoiir head, dear Emealile. Come out of the darkness into the glori- ous light-for your darlinog little daughter's sake, dear Emeline." The " dear Emclinc" thus tenderly addressed is not accustomed to tenderness ; nor is she accustomed to appeals to her better nature, to her poetry, to her love. Yet there is a fund of good- ness, of poetical appreciation, and of true affection, deep down in that woman's heart, which Julia Witherson has discovered, and has reached at last. And Emeline is saved. Saved thlrough her love for her child -saved through her affections. The same passion which led to her fall has now, in another shape, brought her to repentance. "Take me," she cries to Julia, "take me, and do with me as you will. None have ever spoken to me as you have clone. God bless you. I cannot see my child grow up to be the tiring I am. No, not am, but have been. Take me. I will leave this place whenever it pleases you. I will go wherever you send me. I wilt do whatever you command me; for, vile as I am, you love me, and have saved me-and her, my darling.' And the lovely but no longer lost Emeline falls upon the neck of her delighted redeemer.   182    -    ERRING, YET NORLE. CHAPTER VI. - WHAT MUSIC CAN DO. IN our last we showed that sometimes even in the breasts of the most degraded women, a spark of trule affection may remain, burning when all other moral light has departed ; and that by fanning this spark into a. flame, the glorious illumination of re- generation may result. It is also true in' this connection, that many fine susceptibilities and poetic sensibilities ofttimes exist in the minds of our " erring sisters," latent and unsuspected, but powerful nevertheless, which, if taken advantage of, may be ' used as instruments of their salvation. In the course of her experience, our heroine formed the ac- quaintance of a verv dissolute woman,- whom she attempted earnestly to bring to a better state, but without any result. And Julia, full of faith as she was in her cause, began to despair. One afternoon she paid a visit to the person in question. At the moment of our heroine's entrance, the woman was " out," but had left word that she would return in a few minutes, and -consequently Julia took possession of the parlor of the house to wait the promised return. And, at last, she took the liberty of opening a piano near her, and of performing upon it, to while away the idle moments. Never, in the course of her whole life, had she felt so disposed for melody. Her fingers rattled over the keys in the most brilliant manner conceivable. But soon ? her music became less noisy, less rapid, less brilliant, and glew deeper, more plaintive, more expressive in its character. .She put more of her soul into. her fingers ; she infused, as it were, her life-llistory into her harmony. NTow the music was joyous, irregular, like her youthlful life in Paris; then it grew for a                ,   .   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         183 3  while tender, tender as the love she had once borne for Henry Hericot. Then the strain waxed harsh ,nd full of horrible dis- cold, as harsh and horrible as was her life for many months after she had awakened firom her delusion of passion. Then the chlords grew soft again, and the player's heart was full of pure love and of Charles. Then anon the music again became harsh, but full of firm, noble, grand strains, expressive of the grief, but, at the samlle time, the nobility which had characterized her / separation from her true, poet-lover. And lastly, the melody . grew plaintive, yet most sweet, expressive of a lholy and a happy hope, a hope to be reunited to the loved one in the coming future. Julia concluded her wild, strange, original, solitary concert by performing, with wonderfull expression, that most charmning of melodies, tlat mlost delicious of sentimental compositions, that Ulost domestic of all airs; th)at air whichh few can heal without a tear or sigh ; that air called "Home, sweet Holle.'" But just as she was stiliking the final bar.; just as her finger s were about to leave the- keys, from whose touchll she had evoked such melody, a rushhiD sound brolke inl upon the music, the rustling of a womnlll's dress and the heaving of a woman's sob were heard. A  female form advanced rapidlyv to the pia-no, knelt at our heroine's side, clasped her hands, and cried in a tone of passionate entreaty, "Why, -why have you played that? I cannot bear to hear it now. Please do not, do not play it here again. It made me think so of my old home. Oh, why, why have you reminded me of home, sweet home?" Our heroine loolked around, and saw, kneeling at her feet, s her eyes full of tears, a look upon her face which was indescrib- able in words but replete with spirit-meaning, ler whole frame bowed in utter abandonment of soul, the very woman, the god- less, careless, hardened woman she had come to seek. This woman had entered while Julia was playiug, unobserved, had heard the old, familiar air, had been for a Whllile spell-bound, and then--the reader knows the rest. Do you ask why this familiar strain, this "Home, sweet   ,   H[ome," which every school-bov whistles nd every school-girl  plays, should so affect a creature but little used, by hard expe- rience, " to the melting mood?" We will tell you.  As that daughtei. of sin stood on the threshold of her room, and listened to the strains of "Iome, sweet Hone,l performed with such skill and expression, memory awoke within her breast, as      i memory had. never awoke before. Her mind, and heart, and soul wsere transported far ailwa, far from this home of her crime to the home of her childhood Slle saw in her retrospective vision, the white, irregularly-built, large, comfortable farm-house, in which  she had been ushered into life. She saw the barns, " filled with plenty," and the stables, and all those familiar strlroundingrs of the house itself. She saw the ploughed fields, bounded b? the distant hills, which were covered with their wealth of tilnber. She saw   the little rivulet, which meandered merrily along, and the dam, and the mill, and the little pond, and the rustic bridge.  She saw the village in the distance, with its church- spire, and  its neat, pretty dwellings. She saw the porch in which she had been wont to sit, when a little girl, with her sew- ing. during the long summer afternoons.  She saw the cozy fire- side, round which the family-were accustomed to dispose them- selves during the winter evenings; the table, and the arm-chair for her grandfather, the clock on the mantel piece, the prints on the wall, the large-figured carpet, and all those thousand and one familiar objects, which are forever assoeiated in one's me- mory with one's home.- Chief of all, she saw her father, with his sun-burnt face and toil-roughened but honest hands; her mother with her gentle smile and her good counsel, her little sister and her noisy brother. And last, she saw herself; not as she is now, careworn, lost, but as she was then, in her girlish days, laughing, singing, slkating, bathing, riding, leaping, sewing, reading to her grandfather, "helping "   mother, kissing. her father, romping with her brother and nursing her sister. Above, beyond, and far more than aught else, she saw herself pure, innocent, beloved. And as she beheld all this in memory, " the  old time came o'er her soul, old thoughts, old songs, old coun    sels, old promises and old blessings were all at once remembered -the tide of overpowerin(g emotiou rushed fill upon her, and the reader knows the rest. Julia looked around and saw this woman of many sins, and now of many memories, kneeling and weeping by her side. In a moment she understood all ; and raising the face of her com- panion, she kissed it tenderly and lovingly, stroked her hair gently, soothed her agitation, and then improved her oppor- tunity. She spoke of past innocence, and of future repentance, virtue and pardon. She spoke of a possible life hereafter of peace, purity and atonement. As Julia thus spoke, her com- panion listened, and the voice of Heaven was heard within her soul. Bowing hler guilty head upon Julia's knees, she' cried, "Save me, save me--show me how I can become what you would have me-save me from my past life, save me, save me from my present "self; let my future be what you would have it." A few hours after this scene our heroine was!; seated in the parlor of her gunardian's residence, at her own magnlificent piano. But the music which she discoursed was no longer sad or harsh. It was a glorious strain, full of sweet and noble chords, emblem- atic of the salvation of a soul. And she concluded her perform- ance with magnificent variations of that air which had just pro- duced such lagnificent  results, the air of " Home, sweet Home."                -   186       ERRING, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER VII. THE POOR OF NEW YORK. MARY WATERMAN was a young and rather pretty girl, with a very sweet voice, and a pleasant, amiable disposition, lack- ing in strength and endurance, but nevertheless very fascin- ating. Her parents were of the lower class of people, but respectable. Her earlier years had been passed in the usual way of poor people's children, but she had never been com- pelled to exert herself to any great extent, and had remained content with being supported by others. But a " panic" came on, produced by excessive speculation, and, of course, the sins of the rich were visited on the poor. Somehow or other the needy always are the scape goats of the wealthy. And so it happened that Mary's father lost his employment, then lost his spirits, then his temper, then his health, and finally his life. He died literally of lack of employment. It is a disease which a great many honest men have died of. His wife, Mary's mother, soon followed her partner to that better and brighter world where the workman rests from his labors, -where God, that Great Paymaster, rewards all his servants liberally, and upbraideth not. Thus, at the age of eighteen Mary Waterman was left alone. All the money she had was scarcely sufficient to pay the funeral expenses of her mother ; and after the body of her parent had been given to the earth and the worm, after the undertaker and the sexton had received their paltry fees, Mary found herself worth just five -dollars and ten cents, besides a few chairs, a little beddinrg, one or two other articles -of furniture, and a few triflingo trinkets. She also found herself without any relatives or friends, without work and without the slightest prospect of   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        187 it. Still Mary did not at once despair, she made several efforts to obtain employment as seamstress, as shop girl, as servant even. She walked to and fro, seeing this and that person. She expended a dollar of her little horde in adver- tizing for a situation, but in vain, all in vain. Fate, man, woman, and money all seemed leagued against her. Mean- while her little amount of cash disappeared, and she began to pay visits, brief but bitter, to that last resort of honest poverty, the pawnbroker. One by one the little treasures of her heart, the trinkets which her mother left behind her, found their way in sad but regular order to the shop of the "three gilt balls." First, the silver cup was taken away " to pledg'e," then the silver watch followed suit, then tho ringt her mother gave her was disposed of likewise, then even her mother's miniature was bartered to buy food ; and then one by one the few articles of furniture disappeared; and all the while poor Mary Waterman was striving', in every possible way, to obtain employment. All that she sought was an opportunity to work ; all the luxury she craved was the lux- ury of labor. But labor is ofttimes too great a delicacy to be indulged in by the poor! At last, when she found all her efforts vain she begain to despair, then to murmur at fate; and then wild thoughts flitted through her head. She endeavored to' drive them off in horror; but they would return-thoughts of the injustice of 'mankind, of the unfair distribution of this world's goods amongst this world's people, vague th oughts of gaining by fraud what was denied her by fair means-thoughts, in short, of theft. But no, Mary had been virtuously brought up ; she could not steal, No, she would try what begging could do first. So, one night, as she was sitting shivering in her dress of rags, without a candle, freezing in the dark--one night in her cheerless room, which contained nothing but herself and poverty, she formed the resolution to proceed at once out into the streets of the city, and to beg for food. She had not eaten anything for twelve hours but some dry, hard bread;   188       BRRIINO, YET NOBLE. and her stock of this was nearly-exhbausted. She must live, so she reasoned, and to live she must beg. So upon this cold; dark, dreary, windy, wintery night, alone, with no covering but her scanty dress of patched rags, wTithl a break ing heart, an old bonnet, and a pretty face, aye, a face pretty spite its wretchedness, she departed into the streets to beg for the first time. -The first person she encountered was a stout man, evidently a "gentleman," or what the world calls such, for he was evidently rich. His garb was of the finest cloth; he was well protected from the weather ; he carried a gold-headed cane, and seemed, in every respect, the well-to-do man of the world. With a beating heart bowed down by a feeling of the deepest shame, yet impelled by a sense of imperative necessity, Mary Waterman approached this person, and, in a voice scarcely audible, she solicited charity. But with a gruff reply, and with that alone, the man of means, who, by the by, as often happens, was a thoroughly mean man, passenl on, and Mary felt as though she would have gladly seen the earth open to swallow her forever. Ere she recovered heart to ask alms again, a number of people had passed her, some of whom might possibly have aided her, but she solicited them not. Then there passed her by a poor woman, and Mary thought it vain to apply to a wretch almost as miser- able as herself for aid. In this she calculated wrongly; the poor, as a rule, are kind to each other; they and they only knom what it is to be really poor. But Mary had not yet learned this fact. To make what might otherwise prove a; long story short, Mary solicited charity from a number of people, from all who were visible out doors on such a night as this ; from old men, young men, old women, young women ; from every one she met. And after two hours' misery and disgrace, succeeded in obtaining the vast sum of thirteen cents. It may be that other beggars might have obtained more, but this was all that she could accomplish. Thirteen cents for two hours' intense physical and. mental suffering!   E RRIfNG, Y5T NOBLE.       189 Good God! what a bargain I How would you like to invest in the trade- of a beggar, gentlemen? A gaudily-dressed woman, who had contributed a five cent piece to the enormous sum total of AMary Waterman's gains, as she- gave her mite, said, "What do you beg for? You witl only starve by it. With your face and figrure you can do much botter.  Better 'sin' as they call it than 'starve' as they call it." So saying, the woman wended her way, and the beggar was left standing and shivering with these words ringing' in her ears. When, at last, Mary returned to her wretched room, these words still, haunted her; and between their memory and the intense cold she was so physically and mentally affected that she could not sleep. With early dawn she rose, and still she heard a voice, saying,-- "Better sin than starve." Then she took a broken bit of glass--the only mirror she possessed--and lookinll in it saw that she laid claim to a, face which, though care-worn, was still young and quite pretty. Then she went out to a neigh-  boring bake-house and botught a small loaf of bread, nd, as she was very cold, she also invested in a cup of coffee. This con- sumned eilght cents out of her whole capital of thirteen. Her "balance" in bank (excuse the mockery reader) was, therefore, just five cents. Five cents for a human being to live upon for Heaven knows how many hours! "Good God! that bread should be so dear, And flesh and blood so cheap." And now began a struggle between the conscience and the cir- cumstances of Mary Waterman, a fearful strugle, as all mental conflicts are; a struggle somewhat similar, in intensity to thllat terrific battle which took place in the soul of Jean aljean, in that chapter of "Les Miserables"-" a tempest in a brain." In the brain and breast of Mary Waterman there was a storm in- deed. Her early moral education ; her Sunday-school training; her church goingr; her Bible reading ; her mother's teachings ; her own womanly sense of shame, all these led her to revolt at   lo0        ERRING, YET NOBLE. the bare idea of vice. But on the other hand there was the aw- ful fact that while she must live, yet she had naulght in the world but five cents, a broken chair, a worthless bed, a broken wash- stand, and one or two pieces of crockery, to live on I And these possessions, though immensely valuable, would not keep her- aliveo forever. Five cents, though a large sum of money, is laot inex- ilaustible, and some articles of furniture are so dilapidated that even the pawnbrokers will not advance- one cent upon them. Mary Waterman had five problems presented for considera- tion : work, beggary, sin, suicide, or starvation. Now work she could not procure ; beggarv was worse than death, and had been once tried and found fruitless; of suicide she was incapable; she could not, would not starve ; and, therefore, sin seemed to be her only remedy for the " ills that flesh is heir to."  Still, at first, she resisted this lhorrible idea, and determined that she would, at least, wait a day or two, and make one further, final effort to procure employment. She waited the time. She made the effort. She sought work of all persons; she sought employ- ment everywhere--but in vain. You may say hers was an ex- treme case. Probably it was ; but, nevertheless, such was her case. And in the meantiue, while she was seeking after labor, she was starving by inches. At last she gre w desperate. Heav- en had forsaken her, and the world was very cruel. The city of New York had no need of the services of a virtuous woman; and so she determined to see whether it had a place for a woman who was not virtuous. Starvation, when accompanied by heroic purity, sounds very well-in a novel. But life is not managed now-a-days on the romantic system. And hunger, though doubt- less often dramatic, is fearfully disagreeable, and terribly danger- ous.  Starvation, if a romance, is a very wild and reckless one and very wild and reckless was the starving Mary Waterman. And so one beautiful night in winter the stars twinkled deli- ciously, and the moon shone brightly in the clear, cloudless heav- ens, and the snow upon the streets glistened and glittered. One night all the the theatres were in full blast, and the "stars" (theatrical stars we mean this time) were making enough money       .       .   , ,      ERRING, YET NOBLE.         191 in an evening to keep a poor family for a year. One night the opera-house was crowded with a brilliant audience, attired in cloaks and " kids," and enchanted with the warblings of the prima donna. One night a magnificent ball was given in honor of a distinguished visitor. One night, in short, " the gaieties of the season" were at their height. And upon this night, there pro- ceeded forth, from a mean, filthy alley, a thinly-clad female fig-  ure, who, with a desperate heart and aiu unsteady gait, walked on until she reached the leading thoroughfare of our great city- until she gained that thoroughfare where sin, and pleasure, and business are combined in equal proportions. And then and there, in the sight of God, angels, men, women, and devils, this poor, shivering, desperate woman commenced a life that was worse than a death, impelled thereto by, absolute necessity. Mary Waterman was lost. Her poverty led her unwillingly to vice, but vice in time, as often happens, became irresistibly fascinating. Once having crossed the Rubicon, many women will never r'ecross. Reckless and desperate, conscious of her shame, she plunged headlong, into guilty gaiety. Julia met her, tried to reform her, offered her honest work. But, alas I alas! this offer of honest work, as often happens, came too late-too late-TOO LATE!   192        ERRING, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER VIII. CITY LIFE 'CAUSES CITY SINr. ONE of the -most difficult cases which Julia Witherson encountered-one of the most insensible of women to improv- ingf influences, was a degraded creature by the name of "Bessie." The career of this creature is worth a moment's attention. "Bessie" was the only daughter of parents who were pretty good people, and her father was, also, " pretty well to do" in the world, in a city mechanic's small way. She was taught her catechism at an early age, was sent to Sunday- school, and went through the usual routine of religious and *moral education. But she was natreally prone to idleness, fond of romances, extravagant and showy in dress, three tastes w[uich are readily fostered in city life. Her parents did not chleclk to any degree these natural tendencies. The consequence was that at the age of eighteen the young girl was as idle and as romantic a miss as could be found in the city; and withal was as showy in her apparel as any woman whose purse was five times greater than her own. Between ennui, reading (bad French) novels, promenading Broadway, "shopping" and dressing, her time was entirely consumed and altogether wasted. And when her day of trouble came-when her season of trial overtook her (" times of trouble" and " sea- sons of trial" are as certain as death and taxes)-when her affliction fell upon her, she was totally unprepared to meet it. Sentimental romances, yawning and fine'clothes are not the wherewithal to conquer adversity. And so poor Bessie (her mental vision destroyed by the false glitter of city life), whose only idea of poverty was associated with some dark- mustachioed lover, who was ever by his dear one's side, wip- ing her tears with his elegant handkerchief; poor "Bessie," j   o    ERRING, YET NOBLE.        193 whd was incapable of over two hours' continued exertion; poor1 "Bessie," who " must dress well," to whose very existence nice new bonnets, stylish boots, kid gloves, and fashionable attire for Broadway were essential; poor C Bessie" took refuge from the blast of sorrow in the bosom of sin, obtained idle- ness, leisure for novel reading, and plenty of fine clothes at the price of her temporal honor and her eternal soul. All the efforts of Julia to save her were in vain. "Bessie" was lost for ever.              ^         +  Ellen O'Connell was, as her name imports, a native of the far-famed, beautiful, but most unfortunate island of Ireland. An island which lays claim to the wit of- Swift, the brilliancy of Sheridan, the military genius of Wellington, the eloquence of Curran, and above all, the melody, the grace, the fire, and the bewitching enchantment of Thomas Moore. An island which in its natural capabilities, is equal to most countries, and in beauty is inferior to none. An island whose history abounds in romance and interest; and yet, an island where the rich are voluntary exiles, squandering their possessions in London and Paris, and where the poor are to be found in the most debasing ignorance, and the most squallid wretch- edness. An island, a very large per centage of whose natives are to be found scattered through the length and the breadth of our own land, filling all capacities, from hod-carriers to Brigadier Generals. An island whose people have never had justice done to their many merits, to the honesty, gene- rosity and courage of the men, and the warm-heartedness and general chastity of the women. Suffice it to say, then, that Ellen O'Connell was a native of Ireland, and that her parents were poor but honest people, living upon the lands of a great lord, who, though two-thirds of his income was derived from'his possessions in "Green Erin," seldom visited his property, and never saw his tenants. As a necessary consequence, the peasantry were bitterly abused and imposed upon by the agents of this lord, and great distress resulted Et    194        ERRING, YET -S013LE. therefrom, Ellen's brother, a thorough Irishman, wild, im- petuous, intemperate, but affectionate and smart, was obliged to leave the country for his participation in a political affair that " turned out" (as somehow all Irish politics do "turn out") unfortunately. He went to America and was not heard from for years. In course of time Ellen's parents  died, and the poor girl's thoughts turned towards that land whither her darling brother, Terence, had departed. Soon Ellen herself crossed " the sea, the sea, the open sea," and, in a few weeks, was to be found in New York seeking for that most difficult to be obtained of all earthly blessings, a " situation." Now, situations are like policemen, never to be found when wanted. So Ellen O'Connell, at last, despairing of obtaining a place in any other way, surrendered herself to the tender mercies of an "Intelligence office.", These "Intelligence .offices" are features of our industrial system, and some of them are deserving of all praise, being the means by which hundreds of young persons, who have neither acquaintance nor money, nothing but their honesty and their willingness to serve, can procure both friends and work. But many of these " offices" in our large cities -are simply dens in which advantage is taken of the simplicity and loneliness of the poor women who are compelled to resort to them, and who are thus rendered an unsuspecting prey to the vices of the rich patrons of these bogus estab- lishments. Many a keeper of a fashionable "house of ill- fame" has her agent at the head of a so-called^"-Intelli- gence office," who furnishes her with young, fresh, pretty victims. Many a rich roue has " an understanding ' with the clerk of the office, an understanding by which he can select his lamb from, the flock. And it was an "Intelligence office " of this latter class to which the young, unfriended, pretty stranger in our land applied. It was through such a dan- gerous medium as this that Ellen, O'Connell unwittingly ,sought for a situation. At her first visit to the Intelligence office, a young, hand- sdd   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        195 same, reckless roue observed her. He was struck with he beauty ; for though her features were not regular, there wae such an air of freshness, youth and innocence about her, her complexion, eyes and smile were-so fine, her manners so pleas- ing, that, despite of her brogue and decidedly Irish face, Eller O'Connell was charming. He whispered to the clerk, and leaving the "office," went to the notorious Madame W. ana informed her of his wishes and his plan, promising to pay her liberally if she gratified the one and fulfilled the other. Th(i very next day a rather fine-loolking, lady-like woman, past the middle age of life, but " well preserved," visited the In/telli- gence office, and being pleased with the appearance of Ellen, and satisfied with her replies to certain preliminary ques tions, "engaged her." Thus, Ellen O'Connell procured 2, situation. Need we go further into detail? suffice it to say, that ere many days had passed, Ellen ascertained that she, was the inmate of an evil house, oneI of the " establishment." Her first impulse was to escape ; but, though this may seem of easy accomplishment to our readers, she found it impossi- ble. She was watched and prevented from leaving. And one night, one dark, stormy night, a creature in fortm of a man, but wVith the leart of a fiend, the roue who had seen hei at the'Intelligence office, and had sethis agents on her track, succeeded in the perpetration of a horrible crime against the peace of an unfortunate woman. There was a shriek, a prayer, a struggle, but those in the house would not hear, and the world outside could not; for the walls of this peculiar house were of double thickness. And thus, for a momentary and guilty joy, a man deliberately damned, first a woman, and then himself. God have- mercy upon us, but we men are sometimes worse than devils. The filte of Ellen O'Connell is that of many other women. Strategems of the basest, yet most cunningr, character are daily employed to ruin unwary girls. And, as a dark blot upon our rmanhood, it must be recorded that force, brute force, is often used where cunning fails.  And the woman upon whoim fraud or force has done its work   '196        ERRING, YET NOBLE. not unfrequently becomes desperate under her sense of shame, and then this very desperation goads her on to further crime. She who has been rendered, by necessity, a sinner ofttimes re- mains a sinner by choice. Thus it was with the once innocent but ill-fated Ellen O'Connell. Our heroine, who accidentally met her, and became acquainted with her history, having in vain endeavored to restore her deadened soul to life, abandoned her in despair. Ellen O'Connell will live and die a victim to woman's perfidy and man's brutality. e      X t       **          I^ Various other cases, illustrative of various other city causes of vice, encountered our heroine. The almhost numberless temptations of city life produce almost as numberless instances of city sin. The existence men and women lead in la rgre towns, the bogus conventionalities, the seeming restraints but real freedoms, the places we go to, the persons we go with,- the times we go at, all these have their evil effects. The houses we live in, the streets we live on, the people we live with, the associations we live amongst, all these have their natural and pernicious results.- And our heroine met examples of them all. One creature she encountered had been ruined by a constant round of theatres (the minor and lower ones), and a ceaseless succession of balls, " social parties," etcetera, with their invari- ble accompaniments of late suppers, late hours, loose dresses and loose manners. Another creature who came across our heroine's experience had been destroyed by that fell foe to purity, an overcrowded home or rather dwelling not home. This overcrowding of human beings is a fruitful source of the vice of cities, inasmuch as it promotes too great a familiarity between the sexes, and leads to a total extinction of self-respect. To sum up, in brief, Julia Witherson, during this portion of her career, discovered the full truth of that which we would here concisely impress upon our reader, and which from the cap- tion of this chapter, the truth that city life produces city sin. *   RERRING, YET NOBLE.        197 - CHAPTER IX. HM    .     THE NIGHT-CHLDREN OF NEW YORK. ONE night (accompanied by her friend the Rev. George Howard, whom she liked both for his own sKe and because he spoke of Charles) Julia started to hear a lecture, by the cele- brated and eccentric Henry Ward Beecher. Snow covered the ground ; it was very cold, but our heroine and her clerical com- panion walked at a rapid pace, and as they were warmly clothed they felt no chill, only a pleasant, healthful glow. In the sky the stars were out in infinite numbers and matchless glory, and it is a glorious thing to walk beneath the stars! Our couple traversed the city's streets on their way to their destination. They passed the club-houses, the private residences, the theatres, and the hotels, until they had nearly reached their goal. But suddenly Julia encountered a spectacle which arrested her a-tten- tion, and yet it was a, sight not uncommon in our streets. Three young girls, mere children, were walking together. The eldest could not have been more than fifteen years old, while tile youngest seemed scarcely twelve. They were thinly and com- monly clad, in garments of various colors, brown, black, red, and blue, like Joseph's coat, though not one tithe so rich or comfortable ; they wore no bonnets on their heads, only a sort of hood of the very cheapest and coarsest material. Two of these girls were ugly, sickly-looking, vulgar, with repulsive fea- tures, stamped with the unmistakable, but abominable impress of youthful depravity. Their large eyes stared at the passer-by with a bold, meaning glance ; their movements were as forward as thev were ungainly, and ever and anon they laughed a loud, bad laugh and exchanged evil words with those who met them on the street. Such were the two elder girls. But the young- est of the group was as different from her companions as could    198        ERRING, -YET NSOBLE. be conceived. In comparison with them, she seemed like a sun- beam shining between two foul, dark caverns. She was rather tall for her age, slender and exquisitely formed ; heromplexion was wonderfully pure, white and delicate, not the pale he of sickliness, but the snow-likeness of beauty. Hter forehead was charming, her chin charming, her neck (of which more was ex- posed than was fitting in such cold weather, but she had. nlo clothes to cover it) was long, not too long, slender, not too slender ; an exquisite throat. Her eyes were beautifully blue, with a frank, open, winning look of childhood inl them that was irresistible. 'Her hair was ligTht in color, almost auburn , and of a luxuriance ulusual even in youth. It fell around her 'in curls, which a princess might envy.  Her little feet, which were far too thinly covered to walk the' snow-filled streets, were such as Cinderella might have been satisfied with at the age of twelve. She was in short charilming in herself, and doubly charmlingl when contrasted with the hideous younglings in whose company she was found.  Her companions were evidently as stale in sin as they were fiesh in years.  Was she, could she be equally de- praved?   This question Julia Witherson asked first of hlerself, and then of her escort, and then stopped for a moment in the street, as thoulgh she fain would- have asked the question of the child itself. But at thlat moment there burst forth from the lips of the eldest girl such a profane, disgusting expression that Julia's heart sickened within her. Thle three girls passed on in one direction, and our heroile and the clergyman departed in the other. They reaclled the lecture-room, healrd the lecturer, were par tly pleased and partly disappointed (as all .are who hear the Reve- rend Beecher), and then departed homewards by the same  route by which they had come. The lecture had not consumed over an hour, so that it was still comparatively early. On their way back they encountered the same trio of young girls whom  they had met on their way to thelecture. Where they had been during the'last hour, with whom they had passed that time, what they had said and done during  that period, only God knows.  But   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         199 here they were now, at hialf past nine o'clock, on a cold, winter's night, in the streets, with no one to watch over them, clad only in rags and wretchedness. At the junction of two of our princi- pal streets the girls paused, had a moment's converse, and then the two elder ones left their younger companlion, the beautiful child of whom we have spoken, and departed, Heaven knows whither. The deserted child looked for a moment after her fast- vanishing companions, and then wended her lonely way in the direction in which our heroine and her escort were advancing. The opportunity was too good a one to be neglected, and so Ju- lia stepped forward to the child, took her by the hand, and said, in that tone of tenderness in which she ever addressed the young and the wretched: "My little girl, what are you doing in the street so late this cold night-alone--and in stch a dress as that? Have you no home-no mother?'t The "little girl" was evidently astonis!led-probably more astonished than she had ever before beenI in her brief life. Her blue eyes, naturally large, dilated, and a look of beautiful amaze- ment took entire possession of her face. A grand lady has taken lier by the hand, and las aslked her a question concerning her home and her mother-asked her kindly, too; for a cllild has a ready instinct that can at once understand true kindness. The child is too surprised to answer. "What is your name, my dear little girl?" continues our he- roine. "And where do you live?"  In C--    Alley," replies the child, who has at last found her tongue, in answer to Julia's last interrogatory.  And then, in answer to our heroine's former question, the child continues: ( But I have no mother." The last four words went to Julia's heart. "I have no moth- er."  Before her was a child, beautiful in spit9 of her rags and vicious companions. A child, in a few years to be a woman, who stood there shivering in the wintry and wicked streets, and told her that she had no mother. And Julia's soul warmed towards this "lost sheep," this poor "babe in the wood."  She glanced   VV        ERRING, YET NOBLE. again at the thin rags in which the child was clad, noticed the exposed throat, and then our heroine surveyed for a moment her own attire, so ample and comfortable. By a sudden series of movements, she took from her person a scarf, placed it on the neck and shoulders of the little girl, kissed the child, and muar mured, with the kiss, a player. Then she asked the child,--"Are you hungry "t And the child said,-"Yes, nma'am ; I have had nothing but a piece of bread and at apple all day."  i Again did Julia kiss the beautiful child. Then leading her into a neighboring "ladies' restaurant," despite of the wonder and thie comments of attendants and visitors, the Rev. Geolrge TIoward and the fashionable Miss Witherson fed and conversed with this ragged outcast.  The little girl was very grateful, though full of wonder a nd awe at all the fine things she saw, and the fine people she beheld. i She seemed like one in a beautiful trance, which she feared might be dissipated in a moment. This night was the night of her life. She was eating such delicacies as she had never seen before; she had a  nice, warm scarf upon her shoulders; she was talking to a . grander lady and gentleman than she had ever met in the whole course of her life, and they were so kind to her, and it was all so I strange, and she was so happy. It was all so different from the I cold, dirty, wet streets; the cellars-the alley in which she lived; I the cold, bare room in which she tried to sleep; and the people i whom she was in the habit of meeting. It was another world.  Her blue eye was a  beautiful thing to look upon-it was full of s such astonishment and such happiness. And it was a  strange  sight to see : this fashionable restaurant, with its aproned wait- ers, its marble tables, its gayly-attired guests; and in the midt ' of them this little, stray child, with rags on her limbs, yet a fine scarf on her shoulders ; wretchedly attired, yet lovely, with her fair skin, frank face, rich, auburn curls, and her delicate hands and feet; an outcast and a beggar-it may be worse--and yet sitting with a well-known clergyman and a respectable lady- talking to them with the innocent confidence of childhood. It , ': *     iiS.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         201 was a strange sight; it was, indeed. Would to God it were not quite so strange! During her meal, her new benefactors obtained from the child a sufficient, idea of the life that she (and,- alas I thousands of children like her) had led. The subject is too disgusting to be dwelt upon at any length. But to return to our heroine and to her new charge. The child eat heartily, eat as only those who have felt what hunger is can, and at last was satisfied. It was growing late, and Julia was puzzled what next to do with the child. One thing our heroine was determined upon-she would save this girl. This meeting was not to be a mere incident, a mere episode, and nothing more. It was to be the beginning of a new life for the beautiful child whom she had this night taken from the dark and dangerous streets. She had clothed and fed the body. So far well. But there was much more yet to do-and it should be done. The morals, the soul should be preserved. But how? This was the question which Julia revolved in her mind. One point was settled. The child should not return to her old haunts. According to her own story, her parents, all who had any claim upon the girl, were dead. To go back to her former com- panions was to be lost. :No, she should not return. .But where should she then be placed? What should be done with her? Various plans passed in quick succession through our heroine's fertile mind. She consulted with her friend Howard. At last, the idea occurred to her. Julia would take the child home with her to her uncle's residence. Mary Barton had laughingly re- marked, this very morning, that " a little girl might be of use about the house to serve the servants," and here was the little girl. The child was quick, smart evidently; her evil life had not yet tainted her soul; she would be under Julia's personal care, and could be taught industry and honesty; her uncle and aunt would not object, they were accustomed to her whims and eccentric benevolence; she would prepare a surprise for them. The matter was settled. 9* Sf    202        ERRINOG, YET NOBLE. "Would you like to go home with me, dear, and live with me always?" asked our heroine of the child." "Do you, too, live up an alley?" inquired the child. Poor, ignorant one-she imagined that all the world resided ian an alley, because she did. But then, correcting herself, she contin- ued: "But now, I know, you live in 'one of those grand houses with big steps to them." And then, as the whole lnmean- ing of our heroine's words began to dawn across lher mind, she cried: "Live with you, in a nice house all the time, and never be lungry or cold, or go with bad girls any more I Oh, yes,; oh, yes-I shall be so glad. It will be so nice, and you are so good, dear, kind lady, and I do love you so." The blue eyes of the speaker filled with tears of joy. And then she laughed iner- rily-the first really merry laugh of her whole life perhaps. Tihe outcast cl'ild was happy. The two saviours and the saved one left -the restaurant toce- thler, and takin  the wondering, but no longer cold or hungry, wanderer by the hand, Julia reached her uncle's door. The bell was rang, she bid the clergyman "good nighlt," and entered the house, accompanied by the child, who slurprised the servant as much as the servant surprised her. Once more the child Nwas all wonder at all she beheld. She had never read Alladin's Lamp story, or the Arabian Nights. She could not read anything ; but she felt as one who beheld all these oriental fables realized. Charging the servant to say nothing to Mr. or Mrs. Russell con- cerning the little stranger, Julia sent for Mary Bartonl, intro- duced the child, and told her story, and together they contrived a plan, of which more presently. Julia then conducted the child to a sleepingi apartment, undressed her, that is to say took off her rags, and told her to say her prayers. The clhild evi- dently did not understand her; she opened her blue eyes widtl, shookl her fair curls, and asked, simply, "Prayers--what are prayers?" Yes, reader, despite of our Sunday-schools, our churches, our priests ; despite of our foreign missions, which are designed to benefit heathens thousands of miles distant; despite of our   ERRING' YET NOBLE.         203 abolitionists, who love the negro so intensely ; despite of all these, there are very many white children in our very midst, who, like this little c hild, have nott the slightest idea of what a Shocked, yet not surprised, for Julia' s experience h ad taught her many things, our heroine explained her meaning, and kneeling down, the little girl of the alley and the dark streets offered up to Heaven her first petition. Julia then put her charge into the first decent bed she had ever slept in, bade her " good night," and was departing r when she heard a noise behind her. Turning round, she saw the little girl had risen and ad- vanced towards her timidly, affectionately, and sweetly ; looking in her white, fresh night-dress most deliciously cherub-like ; the most beautiful tint of a flush upon her usually pale cheeks, her exquisitely delicate feet bare, ler throat gleaming even whiter h than her nighlt-robe ; her mouth, with its tiny, rosy lips, extend- ed temptingly upwards, as if beseeching for an embrace. And as Julia gazed the child said, in the most delightful, affectionate tone imaginable : Dear, kind lady, won't you kiss me and be my mother?" Then Julia bent her queenly form, and softly kissed the lips that were so temptinigly upraised, and recorded a mental vow to be indeed a mother to this darling-a mother to this child, rescued providentially from foul street corners, damnable "saloons," and hidden places of iniquity; from cold, hunger, rags, cruelty, indifference, temptation, lust, theft, profanity, devilish companions, idleness, ignorance, vice, and ruin-this child restored to decency, comfort, warmth, food, kindness, honesty, industry, and a chance for life and virtue. With this kiss and this vow Julia retired to rest. And we do mean to say, reader, and wes here say it, that Julia Witherson, by clothing, feeding, and bringing home this child to-night, did -abetter deed than if she had given twenty thousand dollars to the Anti-Slavery Society, or to the Society for Foreign That night the child dreamt -of many wonderful things-but     204o:       tERRmNG, YET NOBLE. all of them so pleasant.. Good angels appeared to her, and all the angels looked like the dear, kind lady who had kissed her and was going to be her mother. That night, too, Julia With- erson had a strange vision. First, a foul, dark, evil spirit with the look of an accuser, stood before her and pointed to a back ground on which were depicted the follies and the sin of her early life. The mysteries of Paris were painted there, and the figure of Henry Hericot, esq., stood prominent. And the voice of the spirit cried, "Behold thy former life-thou art mine. Proud skeptic, aye, sinner, thou art minle. Behold the home that is prepared for thee." And with his hand be pointed downwards, where a red, lurid light was visible. Then Julia shuddered in her dream. But now another and a bright, loving spirit appeared, full of Flght, with an eye of Faith, a face of Hope, and a smile of Charity. And this spirit addressed the other and the darker one. "Hold I  Thou hast no power over her. She is a forgiven one--for she has loved and saved others." Then this second spirit waved his hand, and Paris, Hericot and their accompaniments vanished. And   in their place were to be seen the figures of women who advanced to Julia and cried, "She has saved us--she has saved us." Then these, too, passed away, and a little child, a child the very image of the little girl of the streets, who had this very night been rescued from  them, was seen in their stead. The child smiled  sweetly, stretched  out its lovely arms, shook its auburn curls, and  cried, "She is n'my mother." Then the good, bright spirit raised his hand  and pointed upwards- the darker spirit vanished-and Julia awoke.  It was but a dream. But visions often bring in their train comfort-real comfort, and this' dream brought consolation ineffable to the dreamer. During the subsequent day Julia and Mary Barton, in pursue ance of a  little strategem previously arranged, kept- the little girl from the sight of Mrs. Russel until they had procured her completely new and becoming attire. Julia then presented the child to her aunt, who was delighted with her appearance, and   .BRRING, YET NOBLE.       205 agreed to Julia's plans in regard to her. The child was soon taught her line of duties, which she discharged with industry, neatness and skill. She is now growing up under Julia's eyo and care, is always most respectful, most loving and most grate- ful to her benefactress, and is virtuous and happy. She is a saved woman; saved temporarily and spiritually, and she owes her salvation to -the night in which she first met Julia Witherson. There will be one wretched woman the less on our streets and in our prisons. There will be one happy wife and mother the i more in our hearts and homes. One victim the less for Satan- one soul the more for God.   206        ERRING, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER X. "OVERS. WE will now desert our heroine for ' space, and consider a separate branch of our subject which now presents itself. The title of this chapter suggests, doubtless, to our lady readers, thoughts of sentimentality, poetry, rapture, moon. light, mustachioed youths with musical voices and bended knees, and eloquent protestations, blushing damsels, kisses, true souls and happy hearts generally. But, alas! our lady readers are, in this sugo-gestion, sadly mistaken. This clhap- ter discourses not of joy but of sorrow-not of fond, pure affection, but of misguided passion. The " lovers"' we refer to are those "lovers" so called by "unfortunate women." Strange to say, these women haae lovers-imen to whonm they are passionately, most devotedly attached ; or more rarely, men who are passionately, most devotedly attached to thenm. The female sex are as prone to love as the sparks are to fly upward i Even when degraded, a woman must love, and often loves truly, if not purely.) Love is the ole remnant of Heaven still left in a "lost oe's' nature-tlce one light of God still shining anmidst the darkness of despair. We know, of instances of true affection shown in the cases of notorious women which would put to blush the namby-pamby affair which is often called "love" in fashionable society. But enoughl of generalization, let us descend to particulars and to facts. First, we know of men, men oft times in what is styled " the lligler walks of lifc," who lave conceived a true attachnenlt for these unfortunates. Two cases of this kind have lately fallen under our observation. The only-son of one of our wealthiest and most aristocratic gentlemen, a youth beloCn'- ing' to one of our " first families," fell desperately in love UI h V ILU113   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        207 with a beautiful young woman of this degraded lass, and spite of all the solicitations, advice, commands and threats of his friends and father, married this woman. As he had considerable money in his own right he removed to the coun- try, and is, at this very moment, living with this creature. To tell the truth, she has made him, strange, incredible as it mav sound, "'a good wife," and as for himn, he is still the most devoted of lovers, the best of husbands. You may say this is very remarkable. So it is, but have you never dis- covered how very " rema-rkable" the troth often is! Another case is that of a son of one of onr prominent mer- chants, who was, at one time, associated with his father in business. This young man became fondly, truly, passionately enamored of a woman of the lowest class, and privately married her. His father, distracted with the disgrace of the affair, offered his son everythirng that was in his power to give if he would but abandon this woman. The son refused. The father then threatened to disinhlerit his child, still the son refused. At last, the father went to the woman herself and offered her a large sum of money to deliver up the mar- riage certificate and to leave his son. The woman, who was I perfectly heartless, accepted the bargain and fulfilled it. The son, who was a poetical, romantic, unpractical fellow, almost broken-hearted, left. this country, and when last heard from was in Europe. Truly, reality many a time is more wonder- ful and more thrilling than romance I Do not-these facts reveal a new danger in vice-a danger which may blast the happiness and honor of the proudest families forever? But " women" are more frequently, fondly and devotedly attached to men than men to them. Let us instance this by two examples: Not many years ago, a young man from " the South" came to New York and attended a course of lectures at one of those medical schools for which the-metropolis is world-renowned. He matriculated, attended the "clinics," the "quizzes," the EPtI r;I=   LGr rru   208        R ERRING, YET NOBLE. hospitals, and the dissecting classes. He also dissipated, in the usual fashion of medical students-,the most reckless yet happy set of fellows who ever existed. In his travels around town, he made the acquaintance of one of our Camilles. He treated lier inl the wonted kind and liberal manner of Southerners, and she soon became passionately attached to him. This student fell sick of a most dangerous and contagions dis- order. And when his " prudent"Northern friends deserted hill, and his Rorthern landlady--cautious woman-neglected him, this poor girl, this woman, despised by our philosophers and spurned by our Christians; this outcast, who loved him, visited him, nursed him with the combined tenderness of a mother, a sister, a mistress, and a wife; tended him day and night, watched over him as only those who love watch over their loved ones, and ultimately saved the student's life. But the disease which spared the man, proved fatal to the woman. She caught the infection, and died of the very illness from which she had rescued the man she loved. Of course, she was a "Camille,' a "degraded creature ;" of course, according to the doctrines of modern Christianity, her dead body was unworthy of Christian burial, and her departed soul was condemned to torment. But, nevertheless, reader, we believe that, in the books of Heaven (which, thank God, are not kept according to earthly rules), the sins of this poor child of misfortune are balanced by a bright page, in which is recorded her noble devotion, her self-denial, her tenderness, her charity, and her true affection. Another case, of a different character from the foregoing, but illustrative of the same point, is also known to us. There daily "promenades" through our principal thoroughfares a handsome man, with dark hair and dark eyes, tall and elegantly-formed, though vulgar-looking, who is gorgeously attired wit  all the thousand-and-one etceteras of a " man about town."  His boots are spotless, his clothes of the most expensive material; he sports- a costly gold watch and a magnificent chain ; carries a fine cane ; wears a new pair of kid gloves weekly; is scented and perfumed, and is "the chiefest amongst ten thousand, and altogether lovely."   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         209 Now, of course, it takes a good deal of money to support such a B hqgian " establishment " as this ; boots, pants, vest, coat, shirts, watches, rings, canes, and the like, are procurable only, as a general rule, for " currency," or its equivalent. Tailors are a singular class of beings, and have a foolish habit of wanting their bills paid; shoemakers are also unreasonable creatures, and have adopted the plan of asking l'argent for their leather. Food and lodging also occasionally are to be paid for. Now it is ve'ry evi. dent that this particular man of whom we write never works; he has neither profession, business, or property; he is very. like (not a whhale) but a lily, in that he neither toils nor spins, and vet certainly King Solomon that wise man who was such a fool among women--never was arrayed like him. Promenading Broadway, though a very pleasant, is not a very paying occupation ; leering at ladies as they pass, though a very gentlemanly, is not generally considered a very money-making business; standing on the hotel steps is a very exciting, arduous, but not very lucrative branch of trade; how, then, does this Iman of ours live? We will tell you, dear reader. We will ex- plain the mystery in one short, shameful, damning sentence. He is supported by a woman! We do not mean to say that he has I married some rich woman. This is too common a manner now- a-days of being supported' to need much comment. No, no. - We simply, sadly mean that this man (remember the word "man," dear reader,) is fed, and clothed, and furnished with his watch, rings, boots, and ccanes by the earnings of an erring woman, who loves this male creature, who imagines him perfection, and who breaks the laws of God and man--ruins her body and her soul- for the-sake of this abominable blot upon humanity. Not au article of clothing, upon this man's back but has been purchased - by a crime. Not an ornament he wears but has been bought for him by an iniquity. Yes; this woman loves him-loves this worthless thing, this more than monster, with a passionate devotion worthy of the best of men and of the best of women. She thinks of him day and night, -through all the phases of her wretched life; he is the very god   210        ERRTNO, YET NOBLE. of her idolatry ; he is her hope, her pride, her all-all that this world has" to offer her. To please him she would steal and murder. To win a smile from him she would torture herself with every conceivable torment. His kind words, which are few (for the beast does not really love her (a beast like him is not capa- ble of loving truly any one or anv thing), are nore to her ears than the songs of the seraphs ; his embrace is to her poor, de- graded, woman's heart more than the bliss of Paradise. Oh, God! oh, God I how fearfully and wonderfully are we made! And what a wonderful and beautifully fearful thing is woman's love! Poets have sung of it ; novelists have romanced of it; philosophers have vainly sought to analyze it ; but far above all heights of song, all reach of art, all learned skill, still remains, and ever will remain, beaming, and blessing, and enno- bling our poor humanity, the love, the bounteous, boundless love of woman! As for creatus in the shape of men, who take advan- tage of a woman's confidence and ignorance to win her love, and then make a mercenary use of- this affection, live off of it in other words, for suctl-creatures as this no language yet known possesses words of sufficient scorn, loathing and reprobation. And yet, men of this stamp abound. But we have no desire to dwell upon this portion of our sub- ject, and will now proceed to relate a sad, strange, romantic, but true tale, illustrative of the love of women-the love of women even in their deepest debasement--and the terrible consequences of this love. With most of the particulars of this story, our heroine became indirectly cognizant, and we will endeavor to relate it somewhat in detail: There came to this city a Yankee, one of that ever-travel- ing, ever-speculating, ever-bartering, ever-economical, everl conceited, ever-cunning race which seems destined to become universal. This Yankee was, as often happens, a man of no education ; he was also, as quite as often happens, a man of no principle ;- he was in addition, as not often happens with a Yalnkee, a handsome fellow, and had the faculty of talking   ERRrNG, YET NOBLE1.        2" fluently, dressing well, and ofseeming very generous with- out really being so. Now, this Yankee had no social posi- tion, and but little money. He, therefore, turned his atten- tion to women of the lower class; and, by means of his good looks, oily tongue and bogus nobility of heart, contrived to win k  : the affections of two pretty, but frail girls, who were com- pl etely deceived in and by him. Each of these girls, of course, was utterly ignorant of his relations to the other. In fact, lie lied in the usual way that men lie to women; assured each that he loved no other, and went so far as to offer marriage to each of them individually. His motive in doing this was to complete his conquest over the women by gratifying their desire for an honorable unionr-of course trusting to his own skill and to the " chapter of accidents" to prevent the fulfitment of his, promises. Now, a promise of marriage is much to all women, but to forlorn wretches of whom this book treats, a pledge -of this kind is inexpressibly precious. To those of this class who truly love, and who truly wish to reform (there are many of this sort, and the two women of whom we speak were of this  i  number), a hope of marriage is like the view of Paradise to the Peri. To such as these the chance, the promise of an honorable union, seems a happiness too great almost to be realized, a joy which, if they can but reach thley wish for naught beyond. Our Yankee saw all this.  Our Yankee i knew that these poor women worshiped him, and built their 'whole castles of felicity upon the foundation of his faith. Yet our New EngIlander, who hailed from the land in which witches were burnt, and a man was not allowed to kiss his wife on Sundays, quietly, for his own purposes, and partly without any fixed purpose at all,deluded these helpless, trusting wretches. One day these two women happened to meet. They had long, been acquainted with but h npdc not often' encountered each other. But now as their happiness began to draw nigh, as the day of their honor approached, their hearts longed to communi   212        ERRINGS YET NOBLE. cate the joyful intelligence to some kindred spirit. Thus, when these two womnen met, they narrated to each other the history of their lives, since this man, who was destined to be their fate, had come across their path. Surprised at the similarity of their conditions, still more surprised at their descriptions of their respective lovers, which tallied exactly with each other; more astonished still at the words of their lovers, which, as reported by each, were most suspiciously similar, suddenly a dark hint occurred to the mind of the elder of these women-a gay, hand- some, fair-skinned, blue-eyed girl. She drew from her pocket a miniature of her promised husband, and saying, "This is fmay lover," handed it to her companion. Now her companion wa,s a queenly, dark-skinned, black-eyed, black-haired, passionate woman; and as her eye caught the miniature, and saw the face that smiled therefrom, she learned in one moment the fatal truth, that he whom she loved madly was a mere cheat, and that all her dreams of love and virtue were but dreams and nothing more ;,her frame quivered, her eye flashed, and then she groaned in despair. But suddenly she conceived a ray of hope-her lover might not be so false as she had just deemed him; he might have been tempted by the woman who was with her at this moment- the woman who had his portrait, and claimed him as her own; perhaps this woman and not her lover was principally to blame. It must be so. And she raised her head, and bitterly re- proached her companion. But it was of no avail. The answers of her rival were so pertinent; her story so consistent, that spite of her wild wishes, the perfidy of her lover was proved beyond the shadow of a peradventure.  And then, when the surprise was over, and the doubt was over, when the certainty of treachery became a received fact, she ceased to iroan or to rail. She was still, still as the grave. But silence is often a sign of the very deepest, fiercest, and most dangerous emotion. As for the fair-skinned, fair-haired, blue-eyed girl-she who had produced the miniature which had caused this dread dis-   II           ERRING YET NOBLE.         213 "  covery-she abandoned herself to grief, and wept loudly. Her rage was more noisy than that of her rival; was it therefore a whit more real or fearful? The room in which this discovery occurred was a comfortable apartment, well furnished. Upon- the wall several prints were suspended, among them one excellent picture of a shipwreck at sea. And the last light of the setting sun, as it beamed through the window, shone upon the painted vessel which was sinking in the painted ocean. The waves were high, the heavens were black, and all on board must perish. And this waning sunlight and this fated ship were fit emblems of these two women, who had within the hour seen -their sun of love forever :  set, and their bark of hope founder on the rock of man's treacliery. Shortly afterwards the unfortunate pair separated. The fair- haired, blue-eyed victim. met her Yankee deceiver that night, reproached him, and bade him an eternal farewell. Then she went back to her old companions and her old life ; returned to her iniquity with all the awful and intense eagerness of despair. She had been gay and reckless before ;. she was still more God- less and desperate now. And to desperation she added intoxi- cation. She rushed to wine to lessen the sting of her intolerable wretchedness. She endeavored in drunkenness to forget decep- tion. But she succeeded not. She only fell lower and lower in tlhe gra;des of lher class. At last she reached the lowest point of possible woe and degradation. She fell in a drunken fit, one day, upon the pavement, and so seriously injured herself that she died. 'What killed her? The policeman said, "Rum ;" the doctor said an " internal o wound ;" but we say, that she perished of a lying lover! As for "the queenly, dark-skinned, black-eyed, black-haired, passionate woman," who, when she had proved beyond the pos- sibility of a dqubt her lover's perfidy, had remained so still, and had said nothing ; let us introduce you to her apartment the !:  night of the day after her interview with her rival and fellow- victim.   214        'ERRING. YET NOBLE. The man who calls himself her lover-the man who has promised her marriage-the man whom thirty-six hours ago she really loved-has an engagement with her this evening, and she determines to prepare for the appointment. He himself, spite of his meeting with his other betrothed last night, intends -to keep his engagement. He is a very conceited creature, and imagines himself irresistible. A few soft words, a caress or two of extra, fondness, some kisses, some protestations, some tender looks, a sigh of-repentance, and all is well--they are reconciled, and be again is master. So he reasons, and so he resolves to fulfil his appointment. "It will serve to keep me in practice," he mutters to himself. He does not know that there are times when women are dangerous. He has not an idea, that his true wisdom will lie in avoiding the very woman whom he is about to seek. And so he departs to visit his would-be victim, and his would-be victim is now preparing to receive him. She has been very silent all day; and even now, what- ever she does, is done in a noiseless manner. One certainly would hardly imagine that she is laborin(g under any degree of excitement. Yet the calm is often deepest just before the tem- pest. And it is an evil sign to see a woman quiet. It is so unnatural. She dresses herself leisurely, witI the utmost care; she is bent upon looking her brightest ; but it is not a very original thing to say that appearances are deceitful. She paints her cheeks elaborately, not coarsely but artistically, and heightens thus their native beauty. She arranges her fine hair tastefully, and devotes a proper degree of attention to every separate itemn of her dress. Even in'the choice of her slippers, she is very exact, rejecting several pair before she uses any. In all the requisites of female toilette, she is almost perfect. But see, she quietly opens a drawer, and takes from its recesses an article which is seldom worn by women, seldom counted amongst the list of a lady's adornments*-an articli which, thougit very bright and very polished, and very neces- sary-occasionallv, is also very dangerous, and not at all an every- day spectacle-an article long and sharp, which is called a * This was written before the Harris-Borroughs case had made the carrying of concealed weapons a popular accompaniment to the wearing of rinoline s - v   ERRINO, YET NTOBLE.         215 dagger! This "{ article" she places in her bosom, and at last she opens her lips and mutters : "Now I am prepared to receive blim."2 Then she sits downi and drawing her chair near to the comfortable grate-fire, is silent and thoughtful. Then she rises, as if moved by a sudden impulse, lowers the gas lihllt, and returns to her seat; of course,'iri consequence of this manceuvre, the fire is made to appear brlighter by the sur- rounding darkliness, and each glowing coal becomes more promi- lnent. Does she amuse herself by watching the various shapes the heated mass assumes?  Is she in a reverie?  Or is she thinking that this may be the last time she shall ever behold I upon earth a fire? God only knows. All that we know simply is, that the room is full of darkness and of " shadows from thle fitful fire-light." Whether "the forms of the departed" visit her fancy ; whether. memories of the past, and of dear ones who are past, come upon her, we canriot tell. All tlat we can answer for is, that she is sitting by the fire, silent, alone, thought- ful, and elegantly attired. But a ring is heard at the door-bell-a visitor enters-she knows the step, the voice-it is her visitor, the one she is "pre- pared to receive ;" she rises hastily, banishes by a strong effort i  of the will all signs of thought or gloom from her countenance, forces a smile, raises the gas, anld opens her arms to receive her Yankee lover, who at this moment enters the apartment. A close observer, were one present, would notice that a slight' shudder thrills through the woman's fiame as she comes in con- tact with -this man, this man she loved. But her visitor notices it not, for he is somewhat astonished at his reception; he had expected a scene of reproach and jealous anger on her part at first, and is thrown out of Ihis reckoning by this apparently un- altered, loving reception. She says not a word relative to his treachery or her discovery of it; and he thinks it not best to open the subject himself. The room in which they are is worthy of a passincg notice. It is large, nearly square, with the exception of a recess, near the door, in which recess is placed the wardrobe aud the bed, the   v     216        EERRIINGa YET NOBLE. room itself being properly a sort of parlor or reception-room., It is well furnished, and well filled, and contains various evi- dences that the occupant is by no means ignorant. Upon the table, in the centre, lie a number of books, some of them merely profusely illustrated annuals and the like, but other works of sterling merit. Strangely enough amongst them can be found a Catholic- Manual of Devotion. The walls of the room are -adorned with various prints and a few paintings. One of these latter was originally purchased, by the occupant of this apart- ment, on account of its beauty, without much knowledge of its subject, which is taken from Goethe's immortal wonder-poem, known as "Faust."  It represents the scene in the Cathedral where the evil spirit stands behind Margaret, and says to her: "The glorifiedfrom thee Avert their faces. The pure shudder To reach thee their hands Woe!"- And Margaret shudders and hides her face. It is a suggestive picture of the tempter and the tempted, the betrayed and the betrayer. But, alas I there are other betrayers and betrayed ones beside those to be found in the book of Faust I Hanging on one corner of the mantel-piece is an article of male attire, a smoking cap, of singular and elaborate workman- ship. This belongs to her lover, and was a gift from  this  woman to this man: not many weeks ago. She worked it o." with her own fingers, and with every stitch she thought a thought of him. The woman herself looks superb to-night. Her dark hair is arranged in a species of tiara around her head, her red cheeks contrast beautifully with her dark complexion, and her eyes are wondrous. They are always- expressive, those full, quick, black eyes, but to-nigrht they are more strangely, exquisitely dark, quick, passionate, and expressive than- ever. How beautiful her lips are I not full, rather thin, but most red, most mobile, most passionate. We would give a week's life but to press that    ERRING, YET NOBLE.         217 mouth to our own once, but once, in a delicious, adoring- con. tact I And what magnificent teeth she has I  And what a form! not too tall, not too short, not thin, not stout, but medium in all respects, yet in all respects most accurately, ex- quisitely proportioned. It is not to be improved upon I Her hands, sparkling with rings, are worthy of her form, and her little feet, which peep out of the coy embrace of her fancy slip- pers, are- worthy of her hands. Her bared neck is magnifi- cent; her bared shoulders and her arms are so rounded in their outline. Our Yankee Don Juan proceeds to make love to her in the most approved fashion. He takes her hand, glides his arm around her once too willing waist, kisses her, and draws her closely to him, in all the dumb but expressive pantomime of love. Occasionally she returns his caress, occasionally she shudders and withdraws from  his embraces; there is evi- dently a struggle taking place within her, a struggle between the old fondness and the new hate; even as he fondles her he wonders why she is so silent as to his discovered decep- tion. Did he really know a woman's nature he would dread this mysterious silence on such a subject more than the most vehement reproaches. And even as he embraces her, ever and anon her hand seeks the dagger which is hidden in her bosom; but he notices not the movement, and she seems to lack the necessary strength of mind to carry out her design, whatever it may be. He grows bolder in his love-making. For a while she submits ; but then, of a sudden, having determined upon her course of action, she releases herself from his embraces, and, turning her face and expressive eyes full upon him, she says calmly, slowly, distinctly, but with much emphasis and disguised 2 bitterness:  "You wonder why I have not'told you that I met another promised-wife of yours lately. You wonder why I have not told you that I know you, and that I know you have deceived me." As we have just said, she spoke these few words calmly, slowly, distinctly ; but they had an indescribable tone in them, an under-     218        ERRING, YT :OBLE.  tone that defies analysis. If we may be permitted the expres. sion, they possessed the concentrated essence of an ab'out-to-burst volcano. His surprise is over, he sees that she knows all. Her opening of the subject is so abrupt, she has come to the point so directly, that he, even he, the bold, unscrupulous liar, is somewhat abashed for a moment, and stammers a reply. But she continues, in the same calm manner: "I have seen her, your other bride-my rival.. I have beheld your portrait in her hands. I have heard her story. The words you used to her, those very words, you have ofttimes used to me.  You told her that you loved her-that you would marry her. Poor fool I she believed you ; so did I. I know you now to be  a liar."                 ' Oh,! the tone and look with which she uttered this last word -" liar."   But none heard or saw it save he, the deceiver, who found words to reply: "No, no; you mistake the matter altogether. I never told  her that I loved her. I never loved but you. I merely liked  her, was pleased with her, but loved her never. She has not half your beauty, not half your sense, not half your talent. She  became attached to me. I could not prevent it, and I did all I could to save her feelings. But unfaithful to you I have never  been, never." In this strain he continued, and showed such falsehood, conceit,  baseness and flattery, that, though unseen by him, she once or twice lifted her hand to the concealed dagger, she as often  withdrew it, as though her thoughts were: He is too contemp- tible and paltry a thing to be killed. He is not worthy a death. But her would-be deceiver knew not her thoughts. He only saw that she listened to him, and, as he imagined, believed him.  And, gaining courage, he grew more eloquent; he used all X those forms of protestations which both true and false lovers  know so well. Yankee, as he was, he waxed almost poetical as he proceeded. He employs every tender epithet, he brings into    ERRING, YET NOBLE.         i2L service every endearing expression. He is a capital actor, and he performs his deceitful role admirably. As she hearkens to him, the woman absolutely begins to put faith in his declarations. Woman's heart is prone to give cre- dence to man'stongue, her soul is apt to trust in his sounds. It is only with the utmost anguish, and with the most palpable proof that a woman will confess herself utterly deceived in the man she loves. When sinking in the whirlpool of doubt, she, like a drowning man, will grasp at a straw of hope. Often-times she will trust when every avenue of reasonable faith seems closed. Or she will, ofttimes, forgive and forget, and fold to her heart the repentant lover. Thus it is now. The woman listens to her deceiver's delicious words, and her heart fain would persuade itself that he speaks truth. That when he says he never loved but her; that with all other women his relations have been but "passing flirtations ;" that his heart has never wandered from her ; that he adores her now, will be faithful for the eternal future to his tender pledges, her heart would fain persuade that when he says all this he speaks the truth. She listens to her heart, spite of her dagger and her recent, fearful designs, and her eyes begin to sparkle with the light of hope; she allows her companion to draw her more closely to him ; he feels that his triumph is certain. He is reconciled. She is his once more to deceive at pleasure. And he mutters to himself: God, what fools are women I Words go as far with them as money with men. What fools-what fools are women!" But, just as he is congratulating himself on his victory, his treachery is revealed in a most strange but positive manner ; re- vealed, too, by his own unconscious act. Turning to his companion, lie hands her a letter, which he takes from his pocket and passes over to her without glancing at it, thinking it to be the only letter he had brought with him, and, therefore, the right one. She opens the epistle, and com- mences to read it. But see I she starts as though a serpent had    220        E:RRING, YET NOBLE. stung her; her face, always expressive, now assumes every suc-  cessive phase of possible emotion. Surprise, hate, scorn, despair, grief most intense. And then she reads the letter through. Her visitor watches her in the utmost amazement, wondering  what on earth she finds in the paper he has handed her to cre- ate within her such an internal emotion ; internal altogether, for she has not as yet uttered a single word. Suddenly, a thouglt  strikes the Yankee Lothario. Can it be that he has carelessly, like a rash fool, carried any other letters about his person, and given her the wrong epistle? He searches his pockets, and in- wardly curses himself for his careless folly. How could hie, cun-  ning and shrewd man as he is, have made such a fatal mistake I But men, even the most cunning, often commit the most palpa- ble blunders, and thus it is that Providence punishes them. The reason of the woman's agitation is now explained.       : He has given her the wrong letter. Instead of handing her the note containing his eternal farewell to her rival, his other victim (which he had penned a few hours ago, fnot to reach its destination, but merely to produce effect upon the present object of his stratagems), instead of handing her this note, he has given !y: her a letter intended for one of his friends, which contains a general sketch of his relations to both his victims-laughing at both' of them, and betraying his intended perfidy. In short, a letter such as one bad man would write to another, stating his villainy as a matter of pride, deserving the applause or envy of his correspondent. Yes ; the first letter, which should be in his companion's hands, he finds in his own possession ; and the lat- ter is in her keeping. She has read it and knows all. Yes, she has read every damning word of it, and knows all  ; of his baseness. He can deceive her no longer. Every good angel of hope, trust, love and joy, has fled, and fled forever; all the hell of a disappointed, infuriated woman's heart, with all its attendant demons, rage within her. She raises her eyes from the letter to the lover; she sees him confounded and abashed before her. He has no use for cunning, and he never possessed aught that could be called . - v       %    j Xiii   courage. He looks like a hound about to be whipped ; and she seems like a mistress about to whip her hound 1 She towers before hm in all her magnificent but stern beauty. Her soul sees naught before it but a future life on earth of shame and of despair, the very life from which she had trusted to escape through his love, this love whhich has failed her, and made her future career ten times more wretched. But a desperate suggestion has crossed her mind. She can end her earthly woes at once, and for ever. It is better so ; but he shall end with her. The demons of desperation and revengre are awake within, her. "Hell hath no fury- like a woman scorned." With a movement rapid as the lightning's flash, resistless as the fiat of Almighty Providence, ere he could fully discern or resist her action, while lie still is confounded at her dis- covery of his treachery, and uncertain what course to adopt in this new dilemma, without giving him time for a prayer, the woman raises her hand to her bosom, draws from thence the long, bright, sharp dagger, and plunges it, with unerring' aim and fearful power, full into the deceiver's heart. A groan, a shudder, a momentary struggle and convulsion, and the liar is no longer alive. The woman stands, looking like a beautiful devil, and the man has fallen at her feet a corpse. His soul has gone, only Heaven and hell know whither ; but there his body lies senseless and motionless forever. Those lips can utter no further falsehood; those eyes can look no more deceit; those arms can fondle no more; the worms are to be his everlast- ing mistresses. No sound was to be heard no commotion in {he house. The noise of a falling body had been noticed in the rooms below, but as it was followed by no struggle or cries, nothing was thought about the matter; it was supposed to be merely some article of furniture moved or fallen, or something of that nature. And all is silence. She is alone with the dead. We mentioned in our description of the apartment in whch    222        ERRING, YET NOBLE. this tragedy had occurred that 'a suggostive painting, the subject of which was taken -from Goethe's Faust, hung on the wall. Right under this picture the dead body had fallen.  Was it chanlce? There on the wall was Margaret and the evil spirit, here on the floor stood a Margaret, too, and there at her feet lay an evil one. And of both Margarets might it truly be said:          -  "The glorified from thee Avert their faces; The pure shudder To reach thee their hands. Woe--"--f.  For awh ile the woman, the deceived woman, the beautiful revenged woman, the lovely murderess stands, as though stupified, utterly amazed at the deed herself had done. What her thougrlts are only God a1Jd the fiend can tell. Hier eyes glance round the room wildly, as though they ,fain would banish the sight of that corpse there on the floor, beneath that picture. She sees, hanging on the mantle- piece, the smoking-cap we spoke of, that smoking-cap of   "singular and elaborate workmanship"-h-is cap, the dead , man's " smoking- cap," the cap she gave him with a kiss and smile, the cap she ;lad made for her promised hlusband; and now he is lying at her feet dead, and she has slain him. ,- Her eyes, too, encounter that cursed letter which has i caused this murder; it lad fallen from her fingers when she : } raised her hand for the dagger; and there it is on the floor, that darmned letter which has caused this damned deed. And now s-he goes towards the gas light, extinguishes it, and is with the- dead in darlkness. No, we forget; there is the grate fire, the cheering, comlforting poetical light of an open grate fire. Such a fire is a glorious tihing to sit and dream by ; but when one has just killed a man, and the dead body is not ten feet distant, under these circumstances, the i fire loses all its charm, and becomes a ghastly and a ghostly thing, almost as ghastly and as ghostly as the corpse itself. By this fire the murderess sits, in her elegant attire, with    her painted cheeks, her magnificent figure, and her dainty feet encased in dainty slippers. She sits by the fire awhile, covers her face withili her hands, and-and-then she rises, and goes to the corpse, whose outlines form a terrible relief to the shadows of the fire-light. Then she goes to the door of the apartment, and locks it; then she returns to the dead body again. All this time, ever since she killed, the man, she has seemed like one in a trance, her movements have been mechanical, almost involuntary. But now--at once-as if by a flash of devilish inspiration, the mental reaction comes upon-.her- the full knowledge of her deed, her situation and its conse- quences rush upon her. She for the first time fully under- stands that she has murdered the man she loves. He is dead- dead on the floor-dead by her own hand-dead with her own dao-ger yet in his heart-the man who once said he loved her-the man whom she loved and loves; the die is cast, he can never love, or lie, or smile again; and she has slain him. He has kissed her " many a time anlid oft," but he shall kiss her no more for ever ; though he should be with her for hours he would never embrace her more. Hle deceived her, but what of that; she can forgive him now ; the hate she bore him vanishes ; she only knows that he is all she has in Heavoen, or earth, or hell; and yet she knows that she has slain him; thiis horrible knowledge breaks upon her as sudden and as startling as the lightning flash, and as clearly. With a shriek, wild and piercing startling all the inmates of the house, she throws herself upon the dead body, kisses it passionately. All the love which led her to the murder has returned with tenfold force now that he is removed by her own act from her own heart forever. She lavishes upon the corpse every endearing name that her frantic tenderness suggests. She talks to it in her madness as though it were a living thing. But the body lies motionless. The once eloquent lips are dumb, the eye is lustreless. Good God I Good God! is this her lover? Meanwhile the people of the    M24        ERRIXG, 'YET NOBLE.  house, alarmed at her shrieks, have rushed to the door of her  apartment ; they find it locked; they call; she does 'lot answer; she is busy talking to the dead; they endeavor to)! burst the door open; it resists their efforts but she is now  -aware of her situation ; they will enter, find her alone with the dead in the darkness; she will be tried for murder, and lying; why should she lie when he is false and dead ; what  would life be worth to her without him? She kisses once more the face of thie corpse, presses her lips to her dead lover's, takes his hand, his lifeless hand, and - clasps it half passionately, half reverently. Shle then casts  a long glance on the objects around her, as thoughl beholdinog them  for the last time. She sees the fire, with its glowing i coals, all the various familiar objects in the room, so far as the dim light suffers them to be visible, the picture of Evil Spirit and Margaret, the smoking cap, the window, ands a e stars in the Heavens beyond.  Then she kisses the corpse Ni again, gives it one last, long, lingering embrace, draws out  the bloody dagger, and shudders a- moment at the blood.  Then, in all her gay attire and loveliness, with her glorious  eye dilated, and her bosom swelling defiant to fear, with the : cries of those outside of the door filling her ears, and only the : Omniscient knows what thouo'hts filling her solu, she plunges  the dagger, by one firm, vigorous, well-directed blow home to ;i her heart, and then her heart is forever at home--where, who i X: can tell? She is dead. They burst open the doorl and find  darkness, a dagger, and two corpses. -ss^^ss^?^ii IX ^s^^s^^^? l   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        T 225 CHAPTER XI.                   f A BIT OF VIRTUOUS POVERTY. IT is a room in the highest story of a cheap, a very "cheap" boarding-house, a boarding-house where only poor people,' and mostly low people, live. The room is cheerless looking, barren of all furniture, save a few necessary articles of the very common- est description. There is no fire, though the night is cold-there is no place wherein a fire could be made. It Is, indeed, a deso- late apartment. Yet, strangest and saddest of all, there are two indications of " better times " in the room ; there are two articles, and only two, which speak in a voiceless, yet eloquent way that the occupant of this attic has once known happier and richer days ; two articles which are utterly in contrast with the rest of the apartment-a handsome guitar and an elegantly-bound Bible. What do these in this abode of wretchedness? We shall see hereafter. The occupant of this room is a young' girl with light hair, light blue eyes, light complexion, and a tall, slender form. She was once probably pretty, and is even now not ugly. But she is merely the vestige of what she once was. She sits on an old chair near the window, looking out, seemingly, on the bricks of a house closely opposite, but really seeing naught external-her eyes are with her thoughts, and these are far away. She is a poor sewing-girl-one of those creatures who deserve more pity and more aid than the negroes of whom we hear so much. But then the negro has the great advantages of being far off and black, whereas these poor creatures, these sewing-girls, receive no sympathy or assistance. Why?  Because they are near at hand, are women, antd are white-three crimes which can allow of no forgiveness I  9*  226        ERRING, YET -NOBLE. The history of this poor girl, briefly told, is this: Her mother was left a widow shortly after her child's birth, and received a small life-annuity, upon which the mother and child barely lived. The mother was not a woman of much talent, physical or mental strength, and the daughter resembled her mother. Consequently their income was increased but little by their own exertions. A young, man, weak-headed but good-hearted, belonging to a rich but intensely worldly family, made the acquaintance of the daugrhter, in a rather romantic manner, and the two " fell in love," as other fools have done before and since. The lover presented his mistro-s with a guitar, etc., upon which she learned to per- form tolerably well. But the family of the young, man heard of his attachment, rejected it with scorn, and, under threats of dis- inhgriting, him, forced the poor fellow to abandon his mistress, and to marry at once a bride of their own choosing. Thus our poor girl was left loverless ; but she forgave her lover, : and still cherished his memory. Some women, God bless them I are so forg;iving. .     - Shortly after this contretemps, the mother died suddenly, leav- ing her daughter nothing, save her blessing and the family Bible; for the annuity, upon which the two had lived so long, entirely ceased with the mother. And now the daughter was thrown upon her own exertions. She could play the guitar- only passa- bly,.could sew about as well as she played upon the- guitar.  /  : This was all she could do. Needless to say, she suffered and toiled, and just kept, with all her exertions, a few paces in ad- vance of that rapid, powerful fiend-starvation. She sewed for fashionable women. She, at another time, also sewed for fashionable tailors. Bnt fashionable women are often more mercenary in their bargains than they would like all the world to know, and fitshionable tailors do not always pay the very highest wages.  So,at last, lonely, weak, and friendless, she is sitting in her miserable room, shivering in her scanty dress, spite of the old shawl she humgs closely, and is thinking sadly of the past. It is very foolish, we know, this " thinking of the past," but somehow it is natural, and even wise and rich people -           .,         '   - ERRINGS YET NOBLE.          227 Will do foolish things occasionally ; how much more, then, poor, silly, half-starving sewing-girls I Yes; she thinks of the past-the past with her mother- and she sees the Bible; and'then she thinks of another and a yet sweeter past-the past with her lover, and her eyes fall upon the guitar.  She has not touched the instrument for some time ; she has neither had the time nor the desire. But now, to-night, as a stray reflection of the moonlight without falls into her poor room, poorly lit by a poor candle, a sort of half-poetic imnpulse seizes her, a yearning indescribable, and a tenderness, sad yet delicious, overcomes her. Cold as she is, her shivering fingers wake tremblingly some of the old melody that she loved so in the days when he loved her. She seizes the instrument, kisses it, as though it could return the caress ; kisses it, as'though it were the lip. of him who promised to wed her, though he is now wedded to another; kisses it, as though it knew what a world of meaning a kiss has sometimes in it; and then she touches its strings. Though the music is more harsh than it was wont to be in "Auld Lang Synle --for the guitar needs tuning-still it sounds to her like the voice of an old friend. And-- ' The poor make no new friends; But, oh! they love the better far The few their Father sends."- So our poor sewing-girl to-night loves and plays upon her gui- tar. Plays an- old air which he used to like so well-the first she learned to play upon the instrument-an air exhausted by repetition now-a-days, by almost every tyro at the musical art, and yet most beautiful, "Days of Absence."    She com- mences, but she cannot conclude it. Her feelings overpower hier ; she weeps bitterly. She lays down the instrument and hides her face in her hands, though God knows there aro none save Himself to see her I And half in the candle-light, half in the moonlight, she sheds tears, tears of memory, such as all of us have shed-tears in which her mother's  death- bed, her lover's last kiss, her little birds, which she was   228        ERRING, YET NOBLE. obliged to sell to buy food, all the keepsalkes she has been forced to part with, all the rebuffs and trials she has met with, add their share of sorrow. But the fit is momentaryy: She takes up the guitar again, and, as if in bitter mockery of her recent emotion, led by a sudden reaction of feeling, she sings a lively love-song, such as the happy lover sings to his mistress in sulnny France, romantic Spain, or poetic, classic, blessed, beautiful Ital y. Oh, desolate garrets in cold niglts are fine places to sing  such merry music-measuresin I And, truly, starving sewing- girls, shivering in their rags in the darkness and craving for food, are proper people to sing thelm I Bare walls, broken chlgirs, a mean bed, carpetless floor, and cheap candles are like, very like, France, Spain, or Italy I!  But suddenly a step is heard upon the stair that leads to her apartment. It comes nearer and nearer. The door of her room is unceremoniously thrown open, and the " landlady"  of the lodging house enters. All " landladies," all keepers  of boarding houses, have the distinctive badge of their tribe; they all have a shrewd, calculating face, and a keen, mer- cenary eye, which serve to mark them as a race peculiar and apart from the general sympathies of their sex. Some  "business men," dear reader, are " hard customers," but they ? are not a circumstance to " business women," landladies and that ilk. The woman in question, the landlady with whom our poor sewing girl i1as now to deal, looks at her lodger with-a sharp, bitter smile, and says, mockinoly : Allow me  -to wish you joy, Miss, you have time I see to play upon the ^ guitar. I cannot play. If I could I would not be able to spare the time. Of course you call pay me now my little   X account. Ladies who sing  so .merily have plenty of   X money."                    ,  The poor girl thus addressed has dropped her instrument; all sentimental thoughts have vanished. She remembers only that she is in debt to the woman who stands before her, in debt X for a room such as it is, and for several imeals such as they ?' were   True, the sum she owes is not large, only a few dol- X   229 ERRING, YET  OBLT43 .       2 lars, not as much as a fashionable woman would spend in a night, an scarce remember it. But to her, a poor sewing- girl, the sulm is tremendous She is at this wornan's mercy, and this woman seems disposed to use her power. "Madam," says our poor creature; "Madam, I cannot pay you now, I have no money, and I have no more work to do for a week yet. So 'they' told me to-day. (The'they' refers to the tailoring establishment which occasionally fur- nishes her with employment.) But in a week or two," she continues-- Here the landlady interrupts her, "It is always this way. You never have any money, and y  ou are always about to have sole i in a week or two." And meanwhile you eat my substance, and amuse yourself with your guitar. That hand. scome book, too. 'Why don't you sell those baubles, or pawni them until you get that money you are always talking of?  "That book is my mother's Bible. She gave it to me on her death-bed. The guitar, on which I was foolishy playing when you entered, merely to drive away sad thoughts, is the only keepsake of a dear, dear friend. Indeed I cannot part with either, but I have sold or pawned everything else which I have in the world." Too true; too true. She had, one by one, parted with all her little treasures. Her birds, her rings, her finer clothes, her books, her pencil case, one or two rather choice pictures, these and much more had been in turn sold or pledged for about one-fourth of their value to relieve her pressing and absolute necessities. And still, spite her faithful work, her carnest, satisfactory if not perfectly-skilled labor; spite of toil with the fingers and the eyes, for days and nights, at a few shillings per twenty-four hours; spite of her practice I  of virtue, self-denial, and the most rigid economy spite of all this, she was in debt to her landlady, beyond all her power to extricate herself. What should she do? Yet gamblers make in an hour, without trouble, more money than she sees in her misery during a year. And evil women,    who know not what toil is, spend in a night what would sun. port her for a month. This very eve, while she suiffers for the want of a few dollars, the theatres are receiving each many hundreds, and the liquor hells and restaurants are most liberally patronized. Excitement, sin. and the stomach are lavishy gratified; only industry, virtue, and tihe sewing-girl are deserted and despairing.  Truly, this orld is a strange institution. The philanthropy of society, like ifl algebra, represents' " an unknown quantity." The history of the needle-women in our large cities is yet tobe written, and when it is properly and truthfully tran. scribed, will make a most instructive and  Inost startling volume. God I when we observe the sufferings to which this class of females are generally subject, we wonder not that so many fall, but that any remain virtuous. But to return to our two women, the sewing girl and her landlady. After a conversation of some duration, composed of bitter taunts upon one side, and humble apologies and attempts at explanation upon the other, the elder -woman informs her lodger that she would give her one week more. Then, at the expiration of that time, if the full amount of the debt due for board was not paid, she would seize her lodger's goods (i. e., her guitar and Bible, for there was naught beside that could by any possibility be called " goods") and should compel her to "vacate her apartment." Then the landlady departs, and the sewing-girl is once more alone. At first she sits perfectly still, and broods in dull, despairing quiet over the recent conversationand its final words. After all, her landlady has been pretty considerate, as landladies go; she has shown some mercy, and given her some chance to save her. self; but yet it is but the mnoclkery of forbearance, for what is a week to a  poor virtuous sewing-woman to raise several dollars in I   She can obtain no work for several days; even when tile work is obtained, it will not afford her sufficient 'emuneration to pay her debt, and then she must go-where? She knows not, ilto -tie streets, into the alms-house, into the grave.  ler Bible,   too, and her guitar will be taken from her. No, this shall not be. A wild idea rushes through her tortured brain. She can conceal, perhaps, these two precious gifts about her person, and can leave the house privately and forever. But this temptation to dishonesty is but momentary. It passes away as rapidly as it cabme, and is succeeded by a flood of tears, a flood of bitter, scalding, blinding tears ;. during which fit of weeping the can- dle goes out, leaving the weeper to the nmercies of the moonlight. But the tears, in time, subside, and a sudden impulse seizes the sewing-girl.' Cold as her room is, its narrow walls seem to stifle her. She needs air, fresh air. She has had to- day enough of loneliness ; sle will go out into the streets and behold life, human beings; she will convince herself that all are not like her, poor and wretched ; perhaps the sight will do her good.  It is a sudden impulse ; she does not think the matter over, or pause upon the objections that would suggest them- selves to a young woman going out into the streets alone at that hour of the night; she at once acts upon it. She rises, goes down the stairs quietly, meets the landlady, tells her she is going out on business (a pardonable prevarica- tion, and as the landlady sees that her lodger carries nothing away with her she does not object), gains the door, and now is upon the street. Without having any settled purpose she walks rapidly, draw- ing tightly her old shawl about her frame; towards the great thoroughfare of the city, and reaches it at last. Broadway is crowded, and the theatres are just over. Amhongst the hundreds returning homeour poor sewing-girl, our poor wandering slave of the needle, encounters Julia Witherson.  She looks en- viously at the rich, warm garments of our heroine, and our heroine looks in turn with pity at the thin dress, old shawl, and sad yet still pretty face of the sewing-woman. But envy and pity are very ordinary thing s in this world, and so the two w omen merely look and pass on upon  their different paths. But women of a very diff erent kind firom Julia encounter our poor wanderer-women who are gaily dressed, who are   /Ii'GQ YET NOBLE.      . warmly protected from the weather, whose new shavls and capes and furs seem very tempting to our shiverinO pilgrim--women who ought to be happy; at least they seem so, for they laugh and talk loudly and exchange salutations. All I their character is plain enough. But, after all, the question is,  reader, are not these sinners more happy, more luckily situated,  as this wolrld goes, than -the poor, half-starved, hlalf-clothed, hard-worked, badly paid, sewing-women of our large cities? The sinner has no character, no esteem, no friends, it is true. But the sewing-woman has no  friends either, and is despised by the world. Her character does her no good, save in the eyes of the good God only.  Alld then the sinner is pretty well fed, pretty well housed, pretty well clothed, has money and acquaint. ances. 'Whereas the seamstress is nearly starved, has a cold garret for her home, hlas an old shawl for her only street dress and has neither lover nor lucre. Which is then the more lucky, as far as this world goes, the siner or the seamstress? We answer, decidedly and clearly, "The sinner!" Thoughts like to the above rushed through our poor, wandert ing sewing-,girl's brain, as she wandered through the streets upo n this cold, moonlit, wintry uight. The fiend was busy with her;  she was sorely tempted. She had met bad women before, but in some mysterious manner to-night they seemed to haunt el,  and thoughts upon them and their condition as compared Witl her own would, spite-of all her efforts, fill her mind to the exclu. sion of all other topics. She was hungry, they were happy; she was shivering and poorll clad, they were warm and comfort- ably attired. What was virtue to her more than to them (so whispered the deviD; had she not better sill than starve? (So whispered the deVil.)  Our poor sesving-irl started in :s horror, as these suggestions of evil flashed trough her braiol,.  But they would return. What had virtue done for]her? A garret, with a  fewr pieces of worthless furniture; a ragged, Faded, patched dress -or two; an old shawl, a rotten pair of boots, a  faded, worthless, ridiculous bonnet, one glove with u holes in the fingers of it, twenty-three cents and an old broken    comb in her pocket, no fire in her room, no hope in her bosom, no love in her heart, no faith in her soul, no friends, no work, it almost seemed no God! This is what toil and industry and work- ing with the needle (throurrig summer and winter, through day and most of the night, through sickness and health, still working on), and above all " virtue " had done for her I She had tried long enough ; she had endured long enough. Was it not now time to make an experiment of "the other side " of life? (So twhispered the devil.) And now we must record a battle scene. Not a field where men kill men, and groans of wo and curses of hate fill and pollute the atmosphere ; but a'scene where Right wars with Wrong, where Want wars with Duty, where the Fiend within- the body wars with the Angel in the human soul. Spirit battles, dear reader, are the most common and the most ter- rific on record. She stands, our poor, tempted, shivering sewing-girl at the corner of two of our principal streets, in a state of what might be termed semi unconsciousness. Above her are the pure, softly twinkling, numberless, everlasting stars, and the bright, chaste, queenly moon; beneath her are the damp, dreary stones and pavements of the city; around her are houses and gaily-lit stores ; while not far from her rise the spires of a church. On every side of her rushes to and fro the great tide of restless humanity; and in her odd bonnet, her poor dress, her old shawl, and her cold, thinly- clad feet, the sewing-girl stands, listening to the voice oflhe tempter within her. Anon, a really beautiful well-dressed creature approaches, and, looking scornfully at the old, faded, insufficient attire, and rather singular appearance of our seamstress, laughs, makes a half-mocking, half-pitying remark, and passes gaily on. Yes, the time has come when shivering virtue is mocked and pitied by well-clothed sin! Anon, she is addressed lightly by men; and at-last a gen- tleman advances towards her, and, alas I the measure of her   234        ERRING, YET NOBLE, degradation is full. Scorned and pitied by the lowest of her own sex, insulted by the other, why should she be thbs degraded and yet not reap the fruits of degradation? Her character seems to have fallen to the lowest possible point. Why should it not really fall and reap the reward? Why? truly. (Thus whispers the devil.) Again, the reward is large, it will pay all her debts; it will save her- little trea- sures, her guitar and Bible; it will support her for a mlonth. (Thus whispers the devil.) Again, she has done all she can; she has toiled and endured in vain. If she yields now, not hers be the fault, but fate's, society's. At any rate, not hers. (So whispers the devil.) Then the devil whispers many other thihgs (the reader can easily imagine them); and hungry, cold, needing money, wearied and weak in mind, is it any wonder that our poor sewing-girl was on the point of yielding to the tempter. When suddenly, as if by inspiration, her glance falls upon the spires of the church near her. There they rise, pointing upwards, clearly visible in the moonlight. And the memory flashes across her mind-it is the church in which her mother t had been wont to worship. Not, it is true, as a regular member of the congregation, but as a frequent Sabbath visi- tor. It was the minister of this church, too, she now re- membered, who had attended her mother in her last illness. Yes, it is by this sacred place, hallowed by such memories, that she has dared to think of eternal ruin for the sake-of temporary relief. "God forgive me!" she cries, mentally, as she lifts up her eyes to Him " from whom cometh her help"-  to Him who is above, far above both spires and stars, but who is not above the prayer of the meanest of his children, who hears even sewing-girls when they call upon Him. With this prayer, at the first word of it, the Fiend flies ' from her. In an instant a thousand arguments rush upon her : brain ; a thousand, which prove to her the specious folly and il the damnable error of her recent so-seeming " arguments"  t for sin and ruin. Her mother's counsels, her mother's dying ' i:!}   235 ERRING, YET NOBL.  blessing; the love she still bears to her false lover ; a love which, though it can never be gratified by his, shrinkls with loathing from the bare idea of being yielded even in form to another; these rise between her and her contemplated sin. Better sorrow, better poverty, better cold and hunger, better death than dishonor. It is poor policy indeed to exchange the reality of a good conscience for the mere appearance of good circumstances. Let her toil and be virtuous still. Things probably will prosper hereafter. "The darkest of all hours is the hour before the dawn." If not, if she must suffer even more, if worlk fails, if she is turned out of her wretched  " homne," so be it. God could, at least, send, in His own time, death; and the longer and the sadder earth-time is, by so much sweeter is the eternity of Heaven. Better to part with the keepsakes of her loved ones than to part with that for which alone they loved her. Better to let the world despise her for being penniless than to despise herself for being worthless. Better, far better, the life and the death of a pauper than the life and death of a sinner. Thus speaks the angel within her soul; and also tells her in a voice of thunder, but as rapidly as the lightning's flash, many other things which we need not repeat. The good angel, in our readers' own souls, will tell them Wlhat, on this occasion, the angel said to the sewing-girl. She is saved! she is saved! She casts upon the well-dressed, rich man, who has dared to accost her, a look to which he has not been accustomed ; a look which he never forgot; a look which maktes her, spite of her queer bonnet, her thin, faded dress, her care-worn face, seem grand as any queen attired in royal robes and seated. on a royal throne. And then, castinga glance of gratitude upward on the heavens ; a glance of part fea, part pity, and part disgust around her on the gaudily-dressed women Whom but a moment ago she envied; and a last glance of love :upon the tall, moonlit spires of the church in which her mother worshiped, she is gone.  Onward she speeds--onward towards her "home," the wretched, cheerless home which is now sought after and desired  236        ERRING YET NOBLE. by her as her ark of refuge. Onwards she speeds, turning nei- ther to the right hand or to the left. Passing men and women on her way, regardless of any attention that her dress, manner, or general appearance attracts, she passes by a hotel, with a crowd upon its steps, and a still vaster throng within. But many as are its guests and visitors, they are scarce more numer- ous than the various emotions which have possessed her breast within the last few moments. Then she glides past a theatre; but all the dramas of passion ever enacted upon its stage have not equalled in dramatic intensity the struggle of opposing feel- ings which has ust taken place within her. Then she hurries by a gambling-house ; but the excitement of play has been surpassed by the interest of the game which has just been played within her soul, a game in which the stakes were her own eternal ruin or salvation. Then she passes many quiet residences, where all the inmates seem to be sleeping peacefully ; but her soul is be- ginning to taste of that "peace of God which passeth under- standing." . Then she sees throulgh the windows of a gay man- sion sights of revelry, glimpses of a scene of mirth and pleasure; but she is happier far, our poor sewing-girl, than even the most reckless of the merry party inside; and she has cause to be so, for has she not saved her soul? Many a humble dwelling, many a lordly "brown-stone front" does she pass on her way to her room; but not a poor man or woman in the one so degraded as she herself was just now on the point of becoming; not a man or woman in the other so rich as she herself is now in the glad con-  sciousness of virtue.              .      I At last she reaches her humble boarding-house, and gains her  room. And as soon as she finds herself once more within the i accustomed limits of the apartment, she locks the door (or rather  places an old chair against it; for the door is decaying and the  lock is broken), and throwing herself upon the bed, indulges in the woman's luxury of tears. She weeps long, but not   ^ bitterly; she weeps long, but happily ; her tears are tears of joy,  not sorrow. And, doubtless, the angels of God are weeping  Gil with her. Such angels are nearer to us all than any of us ilmag- iX ine, and they take more interest in our spiritual affairs than most  *           i:   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         237 of us dream of. It were well did we but realize this most poet- ical, most cheering truth. But in a little while her tears cease to flow. She rises and  goes to the window, and opening it, looks out, or, rather, up- her heart filled with thankfulness to Him above, who has saved her. Then she looks around the apartment, and discerns, in the dim light, her mother's Bible and her lover's guitar. Moved by an irresistible impulse, she takes them, inanimate as they are, in her arms and kisses them, as though they could understand that she was still wortly of them-still worthy to hold the gift of true and pure, if not successful, love ; still worthy to clasp the holy book of Heaven, sacred to the memory of her Heaven-de- parted mother. Did the Bible and the, guitar understand all this? At any rate, we, dear reader, who have hearts and souls, can appreciate this fancy. An lhour has passed. And in her thinly, far too thinly, cov- ered bed, the sewing-girl is sleeping-sleeping as sweetly and as peacefully as tholugh her couch was a royal one in Windsor Cas-    l tie. Tired physically, and wearied mentally, she has forgotten all privations and excitement. She rests as only the innocent repose. God be thanked 1 she is innocent, and probably will henceforth ever be so. She has crossed safely her life's Rubicon. She has to-night fought her life-battle, gained the victory, and rests triumphantly. Wellington after Waterloo was not a con- queror so glorious as is our poor, sleeping sewing-girl. Women  are often great warriors, and win great battles quietly. And at this very hour, not far off, Fanny Walters and such as her are revelling sumptuously, with wine and feasting, and music, and gambling. Well-well- "Time, time at last sets all things even, And the mills of earth do the grinding for Heaven." On the last day, the day of judgment, we had rather be the sewing-girl than Fanny Walters I The moonlight has shone upon many grand and lovely scenes. It has. fallen in beauty upon the sacred hills and valleys of   288       ' ERINCS, YET NOBLE. Judea; upon the classic, ever-famous haunts of Greece,; upon the poetic land of Italy; upon Florence, and Venice, and Naples, or .Etna and Vesuvius; upon Klome, the city of the con, suls, the Caesars, the Popes, and the artists; upon the Coliseum and upon St. Peter's; upon the castles of Spain, and the vine- fields of la bele France; upon Westminster Abbey and the Tower; upon the Scottish lakes, and the exquisite scenery of the fair, ill-fated "Emerald Isle." It has fallen in glory upon the grandeur and the loveliness of our own favored continent; upon the Juniata alike and the Mississippi ; upon the stern New England and the soft and sunny South. But we are bold to affirm that since the day in which He "created the Heavens arid the earth," this same sweet, all-visiting, universal wanderer, Moonlight, has never touchled anything more really lovely or more truly- grand than the poor sewing-girl upon whom its re- flection now faintly falls; the poor sewing-girl who sleeps to- night in perfect innocence-innocence made perfect by such bitter trials. Sleeping "sewing-gitl " we have called her. We should style her sleeping " heroine." For poor life as well as high life has its heroism, and heroes belong as often to the female sex as to the male. And, reader, entre lous, if the result of to-night's struggle had been otherwise, if our sewing-girl had fallen under the pres- sure of temptation, we really do thinkl that society would justly have to bear the major portion of the blame-society, which enriches the sinner, but starves the seamstress. We are happy to inform you, also, dear reader, that a few days after this memorable night, by a fortunate but perfectly natural succession of events, our poor sewing-girl made the ac- quaintance of Miss Julia WTitherson, who, learning her history, gave her for many years steady and profitable work,-work, that -chiefest of all boons to the poor ; work; that " best thing  of life ; work, that treasure which is the noblest that the wise i or charitable can bestow on man and woman ;. work' the great- X est of all gifts that can possibly be given to " virtuous poverty."

"ONE M  $ ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE.7 EPRATa. *'           ON one bright, cold, wintry nig'llt a tragedy took place, the      saddest that can by any possibility transpire, and yet a tragedy that is constantly occurring- -the miserable death of a miserable    ' sinner. But let us raise the curtain, let us introduce our audience to the characters, to the chief actors, sin, sorrow, sickness, and death. The room is in the third story of an evil house. The house is situate on a retired street which runs between two of our principal thoroughfares. Directly opposite the house stands     j one of our leading medical colleges.* In fact the dissecting-     j room of this institution is about on a line with the apartment to which we now would conduct, the reader. This room is of medium size, and is lighted by two windows, one facing the "dissecting-room" just mentioned, the other looking into the  ' yard adjoining the hlouse. From the first window comes the reflection of the gas-light, that within the college buildings falls upon the mutilated and injected bodies of the " subjects"? that lie upon the dissecting-tables ; through the second window falls the reflection of Heaven's delicious moonlight. The apartment is well furnished ; a fine dressing-table stands near one window, and a large wardrobe near the other ; there are no pictures upon the walls, but they are very tastefully papered; the carpet is of good material; a large stove, at present well filled with glowing coals, stands in one corner of the room; on one side of the  apartment are rows of pegs supporting many costly dresses;         1 A house located similarly to the one we describe exists in a neighboring city. And a scene similar to the one we are about to paint occurred not long ago at this establishment. We have merely transferred the localities from one cit to another   240        ERRING, YT  NOBLE.  and a fine, comfortable bed in the centre, completes our de- scription. Around the bed, at the time we write, are gathered three women and one man. The women are all of the same sad, siln- ful class. One of them- is extraordinarily tall and extraordi- narily ugly; a second is remarkably fat and remarkably vulgar; the third one is slender, graceful and pretty, with a face full of expression and sentiment.      n The man is a physician--eminenct in his profession, belong- ing to what is styled "The Eclectic School." THe is neither wedded to the bleeding, leeching, blistering, purging', mercurial, largely-dosing system of the " old Allopatls," nor, on the other hand, does he hang his medical faith and-professional practice upon the infinitesimally minute sugar-balls of the -disciples& of Hahnemahn ; but rejecting the absurdities and errors of either school, he accepts the better portions of each. Such, at least, is the "Eclectic" theory; whether its practice fulfils this pro- gramme, is best known to Providence antd the undertakers. Our physician is a man of about fifty years of age ; is stout, well- built, of medium heighth; is rather careless about dress- and "appearances," and has a restless, inquiring eye. We use the singular number " eye," for he has but one natural eye, the other is an artificial member, of glass. He is a bold, blunt man, a foe of all humbug, and speaks the truth as he believes it. He is an Englishman by birth, but a New Yorker by long residence. He is a well-read man, somewhat of an author, and, what is much more to the purpose, a genuine bona-fide Christian. Two peculiarities of his, harmless but amusing, may also be here noticed. First, he is very much addicted to the use of " large"  words, not merely in his professional-but also in his general con- versation. Second, he has a high, a very high, notion of his own knowledge and attainments. In other and more vulgar phrase, Dr. K. believes in "blowing his own horn." But the great centre of attraction in the room is not the three women, neither is it Dr. K. himself. No, the central fignre of-our pre- sent scene lies stretched upon the bed.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         241  It is a woman, not over twenty-three years of age, yet looking as though she had almost attained those "three score years and ten" of which the Psalmist speaks. Nlo ot of course that her hairs are grey or her locks few, for her tresses are plentiful and dark. But her cheeks are sunken, and       her complexion has lost all pretence to beauty. Her eyes are restless with the restlessness of disease, and her form is shrunken from its wonted voluptuous dimensions. Every part of her frame bears the impress of pain. And on her face there is an expression of physical anguish and mental agony that is terrible to contemplate. She was beautiful not long ago, not two months ago, but she has been seized with a terrible disorder, and she has been told that she must certainly soon die. But there is one personage we have forgotten to mention. By her bedside stands her favorite, almost her only favorite, her dog  s "Rover."  He is a fine, intelligent animal, and gazes with wist- ful eye upon his mistress, as though he knew all is not well. And every now and then he gives a quick, displeased bark, or attempts to spring upon the bed. Dogs are faithful friends. Taxes, doctors and dogs seldom desert one. The dying woman has been a sinner for several years-one of the gayest and most successful of her class. But she has come at last to die. And during her sickness she has experienced the' truth of those words of the Scripture, " the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." Her landlady, who once flattered her . and conciliated her, as soon as she saw that she would have a     , sick woman upon her hands, would have abandoned her at once, and turned her out of doors.' But her comrades rebelled, and the landlady prudently compromised the matter, by seizing all the poor sick girl's goods and dresses, as payment for the board    and medical attendance she was forced to give her. And the board was "reduced,' not in price, but quality, and   the      l "medical attendance" would have been both cheap and worth.  less, had not Dr. K., accidentally hearing of her case, volun- teered, through love of his profession, his services. The sick girl had at first received a fair share of attention     'n               *I   242        EXsiINo, YET NOBLE. from her companions, but as her disease extended in duration and danger, they wearied of their devotion. All deserted her, all, A save one--the slender, graceful, pretty expressive-faced girl, : whom we have already introduced to the reader. The land-   g lady, also, had lately cherished an idea that her lodger would -iq--E ver, and had, therefore, from policy, shown her some atten-  tion. The sick girl herself had never as yet contemplated the  thought of death ; the idea was too horrible ; she would recover surelv. But to-night, not five minutes ago, Dr. K. has told her g that her disease has suddenly taken a fatal turn, and that before i morning she must die.  It is an awful thing, even when one has led an honest and a A pure life, to be told that you must in a few hours pass from time into eternity; but when you have been a drunkard and a  j gambler and a sinner, and have been informed that you must stand in the presence of a good and just God before morning, ! one's emotions are far too terribleoto contemplate.  The sick girl has heard the doctor say that "she cannot live twelve hours at farthest." She has heard the words distinctly, but she does not yet appreciate their full meaning. She thinks :t that he must be '.'jesting " (as though a man could jest on such  a subject). Her face says, plainly,--"Doctor, you surely do not :? mean what you say." But the physician interprets the glance  and replies to it by a serious look, which signifies,--Yes, I do  mean it-every word of it." . At last the sick girl understands her doctor. She- must die ; before next noon she will be dead. Before, it may be, the sun  rises she will be a corpse-a senseless, lifeless thing. Her sings ? will be ended-and her soul will be judged. She was wont to  laugh until lately at death, hell, God, and judgment. She laughs no longer. The dying have a clear vision. Alas! her dying   vision is far too clear. She sees too much.  With a shriek such as you could not expect from a frameo worn by sickness, a shriek that startles all who hear it, and that sounds like the echo of approaching damnation, she, dying as she is, by a most astonishing, and, under the circumstances, most   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         243 awful exercise of the will, arises from her couch, arises like the ghost of Hamlet's father, as sublime and even more terrible, and stands, for the first time for weeks, upon her feet. Awhile she wildly gazes upon the lights inl the dissecting-room hard by, the moonlight visible without, and the faces of the girls who stand amazed around her. Then she rushes towards Dr. K--- ,who has been so astonished as to be, for- the moment, paralyzed, kneels, clasps his knees, and cries, with the voice of a lost soul: "Doctor, you cannot mean what you have just told these peo- ple I You cannot mean that there is no hope I! Man, you -can- not mean that I shnll die!" And then, clasping his knees more firmly, more passionately, shlelooks up into his face, and begs him for life. She prays to him, as though in his hands the doctor held the issues of life and death. Yes; she who has not besoulght her God for years, now prays with all the earnestness, the tremendous earnestness, of which the human soul is on great occasions capable. "Doctor," she cries, I cannot, must not die-not here-not now. I have been, I am. wicked. And the wicked should have time given them for repentance ; should they not, doctor? Oh, I must live, I must live I I am so young, doctor-not yet       twenty-three. And-there are so many who live to be forty, fifty, sixty years old. Why should I not live like them? Life is so pleasant, so very pleasant, and the grave is so horrible I And then the worms-the crawling, terrible worms. You can save me, doctor. You can make me live, if you will. I will pay you well, doctor. I will work for you day and night if you will but save me now. I will be good if you will but let me live. I will leave this bad life of mine ; indeed I will. I will return to the country, to the village where I was born. I will never see the city more. Doctor, doctor, I cannot, will not die. I feel there is a hell; I used to laugh at it ;I believe in it now. If I die now I will have to go to it, doctor. - I am not fit to meet my God. It is too terrible, too horrible I Youl can save me if you will; You know everything. You can do everything. Y.= are mny God, doctor. Save me, oh, save me 1"            - ,-   -' 6      x ,JBINGt'  YET NOBLE.           X Thus the poor, maddened, sick girl cries, as she clasps the knees of the man who seems to hold her fate within his hands. Si It is a solemn, startling, most tragic scene. The kneeling wo. man, with dissheveled ]lair, wild eyes, sunken cheeks, faded comr-  plexion, and looselv-flowing night-robe; the doctor standing in the centre of the apartment, with solemnity, tenderness, and horror contending for mastery upon his countenance; the three -' women, awe-struck and almost shivering with terror; the dog, BI wistfully gazing and anon howling ; while without, the tender, X soft, bright moonlight falls in loveliness upon the earth. And, as the dying woman prays for life, -the doctor shakes his head,  says the few awful words,--"There is no hope!" and then, beckoning to the women, with their assistance he raises the pa- 1" tient, and lays her once more upon the bed, from which she is never more to rise. There is no hope!"She hears the words.  And, when . .. they have placed her upon the bed, suddenly she sits upright  X upon it, and curses the doctor, curses him with a terrible  a imprecation, too awful to be here recorded. Then she curses  X the women who stand   around her bedside. One of these, the pretty one of the three, can endure the scene no longer. She takes by force the hand of the blaspheming sufferer, cries d "Pray, pray; do not curse but pray;" then falls by the beds-  side for the moment unconscious. Still the dying woman curses on. The doctor approaches   ; her, partly in his character of physician, to calm the agita-.  ,ion that must of necessity hasten her death-partly in his iharacter of spiritual adviser, which is appropriate to all  nedical men at times like this. But in vain: Though he  ells her that this excitement into which she has thrown   By erself is hastening her end, she heeds him  not. If she nust die within twelve hours, why, then, let her die within ne. What is the difference of a  few hours to her whose ,uilty soul has years of crime to answer for? He asks her o   repent, to pray. He inquires if'she will not send for a, riest?  Repentance, prayer, what are these but names to uch as her? And what can priests do at the eleventh hour? :l *        in   ERRING(i YET1' NOBLUEf  -   at o She is hopeless; she is desperate. Let her "foam at God and die." And so she curses on. Meanwhile, across the street the gay medical students laugh and jest, and dissect. And upon the tables before them lie several bodies of women, women who, when alive, belonged to the same class as the girl of twenty-three who is now dying near them. But what care medical students whether their subjects are male -or female, whether the souls that once belonged to them are in Heaven or in hell? Dissecting is a branch of science, and science has no heart. So, clad in their black aprons, and armed with their knives, the studefnts hack, cut and are merry over the bodies of the dead. And the dying woman curses on. But she has exhausted herself at last; her fictitious strength fails her. She is no longer able to curse and sit upright. She sinks upon the bed, and is silent, yet con.- scious.              ' God only knows what she thinks of now. It may be that all her past, present, and certain future passes in review before her. We are told that often just before death a panorama of their previous life is brought before the view of the mind of the dying-a panorama in which thousands of incidents and thousands of weeks are crowded into a few moments' space.  So may it be with her. Perchance she sees the quiet country village where she was born, and all the favorite haunts of her childhood. Perchance she sees the faces of her plain, farmer father, of her good mother, of her handsome brother and her dear little sister, who was such a good child and died so young. Perchance she also sees the face of that honest young farmer who loved her in " auld lang syne," who was always her escort in every frolic and merry-making, who "courted her" in the long winter even- ings; the young, honest farmer, about whom  all the girls joked with her, and whotn she really liked until she paid that fatal visit to the city, and exchanged her native rural sense and innocence for fifth-rate metropolitan follies and bad habits.   246        ERRING, YET NOBLE.             1 Perclance, too, she sees in this her last earthly vision, the winning but bold and wicked face of her city seducer. And  ( then the panorama shows her, in quick and damning succCs.    sion, the scenes of her after evil life; the scene of her de.  sertion, the scene of her fiuitless and fleeting repentance,  the scene of her desperation and her renewed and mercenary  X crimes. All these are shown her, it may be, and she nmust  behold them, though-the sight blast her. And as to the    Yel future, the future upon whose dread brink she lies exhausted; - what of the dying woman's panorama of the future?  'She might have been already resigning herself into-the   ? arms of angels. Across the bridge of death, bright spirits,  i and amongst theln, oh, joy I the spirit of hefloved, long-  X buried little sister, might e'en now have been preparing to conduct her to the "happy land."               -: But the vision of the dying girl, if it sees aught, sees niot aught like this. No. It beholds fiends approachinog from a sea of fire; across the bridge of death a group of grinning devils, !: and amongst them her seducer, come to lead her to the realms : of torment. Is it anly wonder that she cursed but now? Meanwhile, the landlady bas heard of the fact that the "doctor has given his patient up," and, "cursing the luck,"  congratulates her heartless self that the dying woman has left A clothes enough to pay the expenses of her illness, then proceeds with her associates to pay attention to her visitors. Oh, my God, how horribly lonely it must be to die in such a house as this, where your companions in evil have left you to perish  But, stayv; the dying girl is not entirely deserted. We do injustice to the dog-he still remains. And the doctor, too, he is a true friend, though even his skill is now powerless. As for the women who were here just; now, they have gone-onle of   them has carried away the other, who fainted awhile ago, and  : has taken her to her own room.

But he is mistaken in his last remark, as he perceives imme- diately. She has heard his words, and life now makes its last effort within her to prove that she is not " gone." Spite of her extremity of physical weakness, she rises, sits upright for a moment in the bed, and with a face and eye in which the pale- ness of death and the fire of hell contrast each other, she cries: "I will not go. Curses on you that you will not save me ; give me but life--one year's, one month's life. Oh, I was so pure and happy once-and now I am damned already. When I am dead, do not let the colleges have me. See that I am buried' decently. Where are Lizzie, AMary, Julia-all the others? Have they left me to die alone, curses on them?

At this awful moment a clock over her head, a clock of fan- ciful workmanship, struck one. ]Now this was striking ahead by several hours, it was only ten ; the clock had been out of order for some weeks. But was it not suggestive, this clock striking time just as its mistress entered into eternity? the wrong time, too, emblematic, as it were, of the wrong use to which she, while living had applied this time. She fell back dead. With ,K '    ai        ERRING, YET NOBLE.

Ah, faitlifuil "Rover," there is an awful significance in thy name. For the - soul of thy mistress is indeed a rover-a rover over realms of mystery which we, all of us, must sooner or later traverse. God grant that when our time comes to take this journey, we may go not forth like her who has this night died.  ' She falls back dead. The doctor bends over her, and satis- fies himself that life is entirely extinct. Then lie confesses to himself, that although he has looked upon death in all forms, he has never seen it under more horrible circumstances. Then he involuntarily thinks of his own little daughter, now probably v sleeping peacefully at home, and a shudder creeps over him as he muses that the dead woman before him was once as pure and beautiful as his own cherished darling; aye, he shudders when he thinks of the possibilities of woman's life and death. She falls back dead. And at this moment, two sinners of her  : class in the parlor, are drinking champagne freely, and are hum- ming the "Drinking Song," from Traviata. Ah! if they did but see the Traviata who lies upon the bed up stairs!      ! She falls back dead. Across the street the lights in the dis-   secting room are growing dim.

She, too, the corpse up stairs, has retired for the night, and the shutters of hope are forever closed.           all She falls back dead, while the gambling saloons;and the concert saloons are in full blast. And, far away in the country rillage, where the dead woman was born, sits the young farmer   i (who once loved her, but who is now married to another), think.  ng sadly over memories, and wondering what has become of er? While she lies dead. And into her room falls the pale,   EBIRrO, YET NOBLE.        249 pure moonlight. After all, what a heartless thing this moon- light is! For it shone an hour ago brightly, and seemingly ten- derly, while she lived, and now it shines as brightly and as ten- " deily--while she lies dead. Thus dies in a house of ill-fame, friendless, and " aged twenty- three," a woman who might have lived much longer, and died, oh I how much more happily I She might have been, what?-a lovely, virtuous sister, daughter, wife, and mother. Children should have arisen around her and have called her " blessed ;" she should have died amongst her kindred ; she should have gone to Heaven from hbar own virtuous and happy home. All this might have been and should have been, but has not been. She has proved a crying shame to her parents and family, a cursing and a cursed daughter and sister. Her life has been a rest- less but wretched course of reveling, quarreling, drinking, gambling, fickleness, heartlessness, avarice and extrava- gance. And now she has just died, afar from her kindred, afar from home, without any home save in perdition--aban- doned by the companions of her iniquities. She has just died twenty years before her time, killed by her own sins; she has just died the jest of one sex and the scorn of her own ; she has just died haunted by the dread of disgrace to her dead body, and of eternal torment to her lost soul; she has just died, young and faded, lonely, in agony, cursing anl blaspheming at the age of twenty-three. "The way of the transgressor is hard." "Let me die the death of the righteous." "The wages of sin is death." . A few hours have passed, and on the bed lies the body of the dead woman, and a living fornm is bending over it. The room is dark ; the gaslight has been extinguished. But the stove-fire affords some illumination, and the moonlight that enters through the windows also adds its poetical, faint, pale light. The dressing-table, the wardrobe, and the costly "*   250        ERRING, YET NIBLE. dresses hanging on the wall are indistinctly visible; so is tho face of the dead woman. Only two living beings are in the apartment at this solemn  hour; the one a dog, the other a young girl. The dog is seated by the corpse. Anon, he is quiet, as though he thought, as perhaps he does in his brute way, upon the mysteries of death. Anon, he rises with a start,  looks wistfully upon the dead body, snuffs it uneasily, and then gives vent to his discontent in a sad whine. The young girl is graceful and pretty, with an expressive face. She is one of the three women whom we saw standing  around this bed several hours ago. She is the same girl who fainted while the woman who is now dead was dying. She is not so degraded or demoralized as many of her class; and ever since she recovered from her swoon she has been silently but solemnly brooding on death and judgment. All the teachings of her early years have rushed to her memory, i and she is not now what she was twenty-four hours since. Out of evil -comes good; out of death comes life. And now, as this young girl, who is still in the flush of health, bends over the corpse of her who has died horribly, she re- cords a solemn vow that she, for her own part, will " go and sin no more." Yes, she resolves to begin with to-morrow's light a new, as yet untried, existence of work and repentance. She resolves, that when she- dies, as die she must, she shall not seek hei Maker from the polluted atmosphere of a place like this, with curses on her lip, but shall go to Him from a pure house, even though it be the " poor house," with prayers in her mouth, and hope in her soul. God help her to keep this  glorious resolve I Thus, on the same night that one woman  was lost another woman was saved. Thus out of a wretched  death came a repentant life. The ways of Providence are  X inscrutable. The young penitent bends over the dead body of her comr-  panion, kisses the cold face solemnly; and with this kiss   BRAJIN2Y YE3T NOBLEj.      Z3I leaves forever the guilty past. Then she leaves the apart- ment; and the dead woman is alone-alone with a stove, a wardrobe, a dressing-table, the moonlight, her dog, and her God. And the clock, that clock which is out of order, strikes the hour of six. It is only three; but what is the true time now to either clock or mistress 1 -*i  *   ,*    *    *   *  A few days pass and the sinner is buried. Her only mourners are, the good Dr. K., who laments, as a Christian, the loss of a soul, the young penitent girl who, out of death has found life, and the faithful dog, Rover. The day is dreary, cold, cheerless and raw ; a very proper day, indeed, for funerals t She is placed in the earth. The clods fall upon her coffin, but no mother weeps over her, no lover looks his last, no marble records her virtues; alas I there are no virtues to record. They cover her up, and they leave her. By "they" we mean the old doctor and the young girl. But the dog leaves not. He has no mistress now-no home-so he makes his home by his mistress's grave. Not long after this day the dog Rover, who roved not, was found dead on the grave of the woman who was once his mistress. A great man, a strange, eccentric, erring, unhappy, famous, and most gifted being, wrote the following lines as an epi- taph on the tomb of his favorite dog; ' To mark a friend's remains these stones arise; I never knew but one, and here he lies." Byron was not the only human being whose dog was his or her only friend, as our story shows. *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * Reader, there are some gay and pleasant aspects of sin There are such things as pleasures, banquets and mirth,   252   :    ERRING, YET NOBLE.' contrasted with which the life of virtuous, hard-working poverty seems cold, and dull, and dismal. But let not virtuous poverty, therefore, envy or imitate vicious indolence ; for virtue has self-respect, an approving conscience, and the smile of God: three boons which are worth more in an hour than revelries for a year. But, asvice draws near its end, as vicious women grow ugly and old before their time, then is seen their darker and. their true aspect; then they are abandoned by their false "friends ;" then they lose " caste" even amongst their own degraded class; then they go from a liouse that is low to a house that is still lower; then they are made a jest and scorn of; then they can gain barely enough motley to sustain them in misery; then they are forced to abandon fine dresses, feasts and show, and to live in rags, on crusts, and in filtlh. Surely virtue need not envy vice whben it falls as low as this; and fall thus it does in ninety cases out of one hundred.                           But when vice is at its end; when it comes to die; when disease overtakes it in the alleys and by-ways in which it lives ; or, when it is summoned to its Judge from the hospital or poor house; when it groans and shrieks, and has none to heed, certainly none to love; when it is cold and hungry ; when it dies amidst profanity, or despair; when it is buried cheaply and in haste, and is at last stolen for the dissecting table. When all this takes place,             X Surely virtue need not envy vice, THENS.         i ' ' , ,                  .   ERRIRNG, YET. NOBLE.       253  CHAPTER XIII. CONCLUDED. THE phases of vice are infinite in number and variety; and the experiences of our heroine among our "erring sis- ters" would fill a volume. But we have had enough of this subject, and we would now briefly glance at a few ' last" cases of t sin " encountered by Julia Witherson. Our heroine vas brought into contact with a family, con- sisting of an old mother and three daughters, and illustrating a horrible truth, viz., that parents are often direclly accessory and responsible Tor the vice of their children, forcing or tempting their own offspring to perdition for a Pecuniary con. sideration. The mother in question had systematically under- mined the principles of her daughters, till each of them had devoted herself to a life of evil, and then this diabolical wo- men had shared in the gains of their iniquity ; the four now liv- ing in a comfortable house in a manner worthy of Satan. And yet mothers like this devil abound in New York and London. Our heroine also met with a reckless woman, a Catherine Crawford, who serves as an example of yet another terri- ble fact, at which we can barely hint; the fact being that not a few women are so physically constituted, and so mentally depraved, that they become evil by choice, and  surrender themselves voluntarily to their passions. God have mercy upon them, for these cases are beyond all human aid. Another sinner came under our heroine's notice-a sinner made so, simply and solely by her early fash- ionable life. This woman was of a wealthy and distinguished family, resident in a Southern State. She had been in the s   hlabit of passing part of her time with her New York friends !I:  among the upper ten thousand. She traced her ruin to no    h  pcaedhrri               on   one particular cause ; she had encountered no special tempta- tion; but her morals were sapped by a course of frivolities, until at last she strayed; and then the fashion which had destroyed immediately deserted her. The last case we shall mention was that of an unfor- tunate by the name of Jane Kenton, whose history was alike peculiar and interesting. The life of this creature proves the oft uttered dictum   that the basest vices may sometimes, though rarely, spring from an exagger- ation of the noblest virtues. Jane was left at an early age a poor orpan, with the care of an invalid and blind bro- ther, utterly unable to support himself. The brother was of a literary turn of mind ; poetry was his passion; and to gra- tify this second nature of his, Jane Kenton violated her own. She debased herself in vice to obtain the money with which to publish a volume of her brother's poetical productions, being otherwise unable to accomplish this object. She, also, still further pursued a career of shame to procure the means to command medical treatment for her b other's blindnesg-  i But the last venture proved fruitless. The brother died ere  his 22d year, and the sister soon followed him to another world. Spite of our heroine's exertions, Jane perished a  sinner, and by her own hand. She was a Cyprian and a suicide. But who of us shall dare condemn her? Cases like this are, however, very rare, rare almost as Christian charity or true Christianity. Thus far we have treated of our theme by way of a con- tinued stoiry, or separate sketches. We have illustrated by example various phases of sin, and described various specimens of sinners. We have accompanied our heroine through many    scenes, and have witnessed her successes and her failures. We llow propose awhile to abandon the role of the Ro- mancer, and assume that of the Thinker. We give warning "tuball whllo it may coCcern" that our Book Fourth is wholly a Book of Thought. Let us trust it will prove none the less interesting on that account. /   BOOK THE FOURTH. .  A BOOK OF THOUGHTS.  A CHAPTER ON CAUSES.  IN the body of this volume we have illustrated, in a more or  . less direct manner, many of the evils and mistakes which lead to immorality. But it would be impossible, within reasonable     g compass, to give examples of all the causes of vice. We will merely in this place enumerate the chief of these causes, whether previously referred to or not; we will sum them up, commending   j them to the reader's owni private and serious reflections.      e A false philosophy, a mistaken view of love and marriage,     a occasionally leads women to perdition, among the higher classes.,  Our heroine has been described as an illustration of this fact. A false philosophy of a different character, a mistaken idea   j of the value of money as compared with a pure conscience, de- ceives many, as in the case of our Alice Maltravers.        i The dangers of city life are another prolific source of sin. So are the " popular" amusements of our great centres of life; our concert saloons, our dancing halls, our public balls, and at least one-half of. our theatres, as at present conducted. The strategems employed by "men about town" to deceive and betray young women ;. the " decoy agents " employed by the proprietresses of evil establishments ; the fictitious " intelligence offices," and the so-styled " restaurants ;" and last and most shameful of all, the facilities afforded for the successful use of brutal force, render our modern cities truly dangerous to virtue. The neglect of children by their parents, especially by their   256        EBUING, YET NOBLE. mothers, the-permitting sons and daughters to live unwatched, is a prolific source of evil. Ill-assorted marriages are also to be numbered among the causes of vice : the partners seeking abroad that happiness -which is denied them at home. The unrestrained intimacies between the sexes which is a characteristic of American social life is likewise another provocative of social vice. The customs of fashionable-life among us are unfavorable to virtue; the shadow of decorum is preserved, at the expense of reality. fMen neglect their wives and devote themselves to the wives of their neighbors, their neighbors returning the compli- ment, while unmarried men are far too attentive to married women. The ignorance of physiolog;y which prevails, despite our so- called civilization, in our midst, is a more prominent cause of evil than the unthinking imagine. Ignorance is not always bliss, it is not always folly to be wise. There also are various physical causes of sin known solely to the physician. Error is often the consequence of a disordered material organization. Error often results likewise from a diseased moral system- from a misapplication of noble qualities. As in the case of Jane Kenton, who was led to impurity by the exaggeration of a pure love for her helpless brother. Natural and almost unconquerable passions lead hot a few to sin ; passions which are strengthened by surfeit and inltenmperance. Overcrowded dwellings, the tenement-house system, the herd- ing together of the sexes, and the like features of poor life in our great cities, as likewise among the middle classes the boarding- house system, destroy the honor of thousands of females annually. Bad men and bad twomen, profligate or mercenary fathers and mothers, add their misery and vice to the great aggregate. Thp three prime causes of evil are Dress, Seduction, Poverty. The former slays its hundreds of souls, the second its tleous- ands, and the'last its tens of thousands. The cure for the first is economy, and good taste, and education ; for the second, im- proved public sentiment and parental watchfulness i and for the last, true philanthropy, true notions of the -" public interest " and of " woman's sphere," and truly Christian charity.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        201 CHAPTER 1I. A CHAPTER OF FACTS. DID a pure being of another sphere visit this world of ours, he would refuse to believe that there existed in our midst human beings who sold themselves, body and soul, to iniquity, to dis- grace in this life and ruin in the life to come, for a few dresses, a few dinners, or a few dollars. But he would be forced to be. lieve, at last. Still the pure being would solace himself with the reflection that at least these vile creatures were discounte- nanced by all who were of any elevation or importance. But, alas I even in this supposition he would be mistaken ; immorality not only exists but flourishes, by the patronage of those who have patronage to bestow. We are cognizant of an establishment which is almost nightly attended by a lawyer (a leading public official and a married man) and his intimate friend, a well known physi- cian, who is also a man of family. A very daring stock operator, who controls millions, is also a frequenter. A prominent merchant, whose wife and daughter are at the opera nightly, is found often within these walls; and one or two fast men of our fashionable clubs, who are " engaged ' to the daughters of prominent men. While ever and anon is admitted, at a late hour, the portly form of a famous " tragedian," who, having just died a virtuous death upon the stage, has returned to life and to iniquity. Thus sin flourishes, when men of wealth, family, talent, and--position encourage it. We are not drawing upon 'our imagination. We are speaking of what we know. It would not be difficult to tell of another evil resort, where a bank president, a railroad president, a, railroad director, men of -  .           . o   258       ERRING, YET NOBLE. means and station, and married men, can be found twice or thrice a week. And yet, every Sunday morning these gen- tlemen are to be seen in church, as full of devotion as of dol- lars. Truly this is a great world I The establishments above mentioned are among the genteel and well-conducted of their kind. The mistresses are comparatively kind-hearted, treat their girls with con- sideration, and are liked by them in return. Their table is good, and when sick, the best attendance is given. The girls live in harmony together, and apparent decorum is pre- served. Everything but virtue is to be found, and pleasure substitutes honor and true happiness. The visitors are most respectable, and the establishments, in all respects, save one, are irreproachable. Many such places abound in all cities, though they are but exceptions to the general rule of gross drunkenness, disorder, low gambling and vulgar RIOT. The grades of houses of this kind are numerous, and not well defined. T'he number and quality of the inmates, the character of the mistress, the style of the house, the manner in which the inmates live, the quality of their visitors, the degree of decorum preserved, the amount of drinking and gambling practised, all these details admit of - n infinite variety. Evil houses comprise not only establishments in which the women board anid live, but also houses where no women per- manently live, but where, alas I far too many come by appoint- ment. Of thlese -pernicious, numerous, fashionable establish- ments, we could tell many a sad, true story. We could tell of many a wife, or mother, or " belle," who, instead of "shopping" or- "promenading," under these excuses enters cautiously and disguised some respectable-looking house, there- meets some husband and father, who has not the-fear of God, and then returns unsuspected to her home and family. The shrewd, money-making proprietors of these places have more men and women in their power than any dream of. And we assure the reader that this system has become a well-   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        259 understood, a well-patronized, and a well paid branch of modern social science. Another class of houses embraces those situate in notorious localities, where the Magdalenes of our nightly streets reside. Other varieties are seemingly respectable board- ing-houses on quiet streets, devoted to the higher class of these creatures, and which advertise in the '"Herald," as offering "'board for the lady only." Another class are called hotels, on the "European plan," the feature being that the inmates are women. Then there are a number of elegant " restaurants" on fashionable streets devoted secretly to pernicious purposes. Another class comprises the numer- ous cellars and " saloons." These " dark places of iniquity" abound, and here God and Law may both be defied. In addition to these places there are many " dens," "panel houses" and earthly " hells," inhabited by thieves and women of the lowest 'stamp, and even by children as depraved as their elders. These localities are well-known to the police, and have witnessed many horrible but suggestive spectacles ; spectacles to which only the pen of the recording angel, or the genius of men like Dickens, Sue, or Hugo can do justice. Erring women may be divided into various classes. The favorites of our wealthy citizens come first. Many of these women are fit for better things, live and dress elegantly, and, as far as this world goes, are happily situated. Next come those who live-in such establishments as those patronized by highly respectable gentlemen, " after the opera." Then rank the denizens of the boarding-houses and "European hotels" just referred to. Then follow the inmates of second-class houses on certain streets. Then come the sad army of the nightly walkers of our streets. Then, lower still, come th "saloon girls," the so-called " pretty waiter girls" of concert halls, and the like. And lastly, and lowest in the possible scale of female humanity, come those companions of thieves, those drunken, profane, filthy, degraded women whom only the genius who drew Nancy Sykes can worthily paint.   260       ERRING, YET NOBLE. It must be borne in mind, however, that these different varieties often glide into each other. It must also be remem- bered that there are some characteristics common to all in a greater or less degree. Thus, proneness to intoxication, proneness to profanity, gambling, a tendency to recklessness and riot, extravagance in expenditure and dress, and a cer- tain coarseness, vulgarity and general heartlessness, mark each and every variety of " erring women." The proprietresses of these places are, as a class, more vile, more degraded, and more heartless than their people. Some of them are rich, live in fine style, pay taxes, rent their houses of'pious and respectable landlords, or own houses them- selves ; nevertheless, they are, as a race, most disgusting and criminal. Some of them treat their girls kindly ; but the ma- jority act towards them with heartlessness and greed. They charge them exhorbitant rates of board, and bring them constantly in debt; they keep their clothes from them, or else supply them with dresses so as to possess their services and send them off when sickness shizes them, or their beauty fades. c, The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." Many of these proprietresses have " agents" who are paid liberally. Such facts as these make us blush for women; yet these are facts; and these are or rather have been ," women." As for the unfortunates in " the employ" of these wretches, many of them live together harmoniously, even friendly. It often happens that the virtues of charity and consolation, generosity and magnanimity, are'shown brightly by'fallen women in their conduct to each other. None are wholly de- praved-remember this, dear reader. Occasionally, however, it happens that the depravity of their morals gradually pol- lutes their personal relations to each other. As to the manner in which these women spend their time, the reader can form a general idea. They rise late, and dur- ing the day some remain in the house, play cards, drink, etc., etc.; others " promenade" the streets, "go shopping," or add **'.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        261 another acquaintance to their long list; while a few of a higher class perhaps devote an hour or two to household duties, or to reading. It is needless to say that the sound of prayer or thanksgiving is never heard in their midst; and that those sacred words "God " and " heaven" are never used save in the way of profanity. {And when night comes their fearful day commences. In summer afternoons you may behold them in the parks, and in the hotels in the neighborhood of cities, and " on the road," in the company of " young bloods," who drive " fast" horses. You -may see them under various names and dis- guises, boarding during the heated term at leading hotels and "crack" watering places. You may see them at theatres or balls, and on Broadway during the winter. You may also see them in the hospital often, in the poor-house sometirmees, in the prison occasionally, and on the dissecting table not seldom. And you and we, reader, will some time see them all standing and trembling before the bar of the All-Just, there to answer in the spirit for the sins done in the flesh. With respect to the management of the resorts of vice, some of the higher class are so conducted that the most fastidious taste finds naught at which to be offended. Vice here seems to lose half its evil by losing all its grossness. Bat these places are, on this very account, the more dangerous. Thley are rare, however. lost of the abodes of iniquity are as horribly disgusting as they are terribly vile. As for the money which these women obtain at so great a price, it is astonishing how little good it does to them. They spend it as recklessly, most of them, as they make it. A few, it is true, save their money for themselves, or those they love ; but the great majority waste it in drinking, gambling, dress and folly. Most sinners are great fools I Many persons have but a very imperfect idea of what a vast sum is expended upon iniquity. A few numerical data will serve to enlighten them upon this point. In the higher class establishments the inmates pay from $10 to $20 per *  .   262       ERRING, YET NOBLE. week for their board and lodging, exclusive of "washing" and "extras." Many of them employ a hair-dresser at a high price to arrange their toilet, and in several establish- ments a musician is engaged at a very liberal salary for the express purpose of delighting, by his performances, the guests. The average receipts of women of the upper classes cannot fall short of $50 per week. Many receive double and triple that amount; but when you deduct their expenses for board, washing, extras, fees, and, above all, dress, but little remains to be saved. The proprietresses of these "places" are often wealthy; some times they own their establishment and futniture, but generally rent both at the rate often of several thousand dollars per annum. The weekly receipts of the leading establishments of New York city cannot be less on an average than $500, while in some cases they amount to over $1,000. A large corps of housekeepers and servants are employed at liberal salaries, with considerable perquisites. The meals are excellent, and the establishments are conducted on a general system of lavish expenditure. Altogether wickedness is a very profitable, paying business. Listen to the following facts, dear reader. - A capital of millions of dollars is invested in vice, in the Christian cities of New York and Philadelphia. Many millions of dollars are expended annually in vice in the same Christian cities. Many hundreds of thousands of dollars are annually spent by vice for wines and other " extras." Hundreds of thousands of dollars are given by vice to physicians or quacks per year. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are paid by tax- payers as the municipal expenses of vice, in shape of peniten- tiaries and hospitals. Many thousands of women are living by vice ; and many thousands of men are being led by vice into pecuniary and moral ruin. Mhillions are squandered, and health, honor, love, virtue, God and heaven are lost I The Evils that result from immorality cannot be over-esti- mated. Were they properly appreciated there would be no immorality. It is not an exaggeration to assert that the   M RING, YET NOBLE.        263 social evil is as destructive as a pestilence--that vice is as pernicious as the cholera--aye, ten times more terrible, from its universal prevalence, and its moral as well as physical influence.  . The evils of the sin of which we speak comprise the dan- gers to theft and murder to which the licentious are liable among their low haunts in our great cities; and the fearful risk incurred of abominable disease-the latter a scourge, of all the curses of God the mcst horrible, and yet amazingly prevalent in all classes of society. Beside these material ills there come, in the train of vice the vast army of the foundlings; the loss of reputation in- curred some times by the mait as well as always by the woman; the wear and tear of the nerves and of the feelings incident to illicit intimacies between the sexes, and the tragedies that daily result therefrom. Surely added to the sin itself these evils form a combined picture almlost too dark for human con- templation. And yet,- with all its patent and crying ills it is amusingly terrible to see how " refined" society will persist in ignoring the social evil. To judge by w ords and seemins, e would be tempted to imagine immorality an unthought of mystery; but go into our streets at night and 'the my stery is plain enough.  Sin is no wonder on Broadway after dark, or by daylight either; it is a common reality, and faz too palpably evident and disgusting. No virtuous woman can walk our streets without havfing her eyes shocked and-her heart pained by the sight, aye, the contact even of women who are not virtdous. And in many portions of our cities, and at certain hours during the twenty four, vice is not only public, but fearfully nauseating in its permitted vileness. Yet this same vice is, in other places, and at other times, elegant, tempting, skillfully gilded, and as seductive to, the senses as it is f atal to the soul. While alike in its splendor or its squallor, it is full of danger to the community and the individual, to the mortal body and the immortal spirit. ^ inT^^r^^ ad ^ei^ota sirt   264:        ERRING, YET NOBLE. By every consideration that can affect or influence the per. son or the people; by the duty of economy and sense in the expenditure of our money; by the hope to improve the con- dition of our community, to lessen the number of its nui- sances, its dangers and its criminals; by the peace of our homes, the sanctity of our domestic altars; for the sake of the temporal and eternal safety of our wives, daughters, sis- ters end loved ones ; by our own desires for health and hap- piness; for the sake of morality and for the love of God, let us all, who read this book, strive to lessen the evil upon which it is written.  ERRING, YET NOBLE.         265 CHAPTER III. A CHAPTER ON TREATMENT AND CURE. IT does not suffice to describe an evil in its more dramatic aspects. Those who thus paint the evil should also be able to point out means, if notfor its cure, at least for its amelioration. Allow us, then, dear reader, a few words on the -treatment and cure of vice, a most important point; a vitally important one, though divers and sundry of our sickly sentimentalists dismiss it with the stereotyped finality that it is a "delicate topic."  We repeat that it is no less an important one, and though we shall handle it as "delicately " as possible, we shall also treat it boldly and truthfully. The Law and the Church have, at various times and in vari. ous places, attempted the impossible feat of total suppressioi, of vice, and have only succeeded in proving the attempt an absurd. ity. But, though perfect virtue is impossible till the millennium, very much can be done in the way of modifying and ameliorat- ing evil, depriving it of some of its most appalling attendant cir- cumstances, and greatly reducing the number of its more imme. diate victims. The means by which these desirable objects may be accome plished are five in number: 1st.-The Removal of the Causes of Vice. 2nd,-Legal Enactments.                 i 3d.-Early and Prudent Marriages. 4th.-The Activ-e and Direct Influence of Good Women, and 5th.--The Improving and Elevating of the Moral Tone of Society. Let us consider these means separately, in the order in which we have enumerated them. 12    266        ERRING, YET NOBLE. 1st. The Remo'val of the Causes of Vice.--This means of cure can be but barely stated, as its full consideration would require a volume. We have in the first chapter of the present book enumerated the majority of the causes of error. If the reader will but -consider each of these thoughtfully in his own mind, his good sense will suggest the best method of its abolition. 2nd. Legal Enactments.-The law certainly should take cog- nizance of this great and widely-spread evil. In Paris a most excellent system of ,legislation prevails upon this subject, and the law is as thoroughly enforced as it is admi- rably conceived. It would be an immense gain to our country if we "moral"Americans wohld but adopt both the theory and the practice, on this subject, of those Parisians who are so often and so -flippantly called " immoral." But this branch of the sub- ject hardly admits of being treated of in a work of this kind. We refer the thoughtful and inquiring among our readers, for full information on this point, to other sources. 3d. Early and .Prudent Maarriages.-This term may seem contradictory. Many will say that an early cannot be a prudent marriage; but the many are mistaken. The earlier a man weds for love, and having wedded, works for his wife and family, the better for him, 'for his family, for society, and for morality. His natural passion is hereby gratified and his noble ambition is here- by stimulated. Were wedlock more common, vice would be un- common. 4th, and most important. The Action and Direct IZfluence of Virtuous Women.--Our heroine, Julia Witherson (who, spite of her early error, fully deserves to be -classed among "virtuous women"), is an illustration of how much good can be accom- plished by this agency. But (as we are now departing for a while from our sphere of novelist, and are adopting the character of a writer who writes in all seriousness upon a most serious subject), we will grant' that our heroine's adventures are somewhat imaginary; still women have had a real existence who have approached closely to our heroine's example.  Women have, existed who have endeavored to   reform even Cyprians--Mrs. Fry, for instance,-aye, and succeeded in their endeavors, too. And even supposing that hitherto no woman had ever made an attempt of this hnd- what then? Does it follow that no attempt shall ever be made? By no means. We do not mean that, as society is at present constituted, it would be practicable or advisable for respectable females to disguise themselves, as our heroine did, and, like her,. visit the haunts of infamy. Our heroine was,-in many respects, a most remarkable woman, remarkable both in her history and her character, and she did some remarkable things. We have recorded and described her character, history, views and actions, not as a specimen of average female existence and duty, not as an everyday specimen of womanhkind, but merely as a fictitious, perhaps exaggerated illustration of two great truths ; vhich truths are-first, that an erring woman can reform; second, that one woman can, if she chooses, bring about the re- formation of miany others. But, farther than this, we certainly do think that the general example set by Julia Witherson ill relation to the erring of her own sex could (to a certain degree, and to a much larger degree than has ever as yet been attempted,) be followed to Imuch ad- vantage by virtuous women generally. If married women of po- sition, influence, and true Christianity would but bestow as much time, and care, and labor, and sympathy, and advice, and aid upon the vicious of their own sex as they do upon the merely unfortunate, vaster results would be accomplished for the cause of morality than has as yet been even imagined. If married women of position and influence would but descend from their high places of indignation, and would think it no more disgrace (as it really is not) to visit and relieve personally a sinner than it is to visit and relieve a sufferer, morality would be much the gainer. Magdalene Societies and Rosine Associations are all very well in their way, but theirs is a very small way. One of the great ob- stacles which at present exist to the reformation of women is their knowledge that their own sex despise them more and treat  268        ERRING, YET NOBLE. them more cruelly than the male sex; that they have absolutely more to fear from virtuous women than from worldly men. But we are certain that were it once seen and known that virtuous females took a certain degree of interest in, and felt a certain degree of sympathy for, the poor sinners"of their own sex ; if the spotless did but visit personally the stained and polluted, speak kindly to them, and give them, like the Saviour, a chance to " go and sin no more," then, indeed, would the ranks of the female army of sorrow arid sin be materially and most glo- riously diminished ; then, indeed, would there be "joy in heavena over (many) a sinner that repenteth." And if the time ever does come (as we trust it may) when good- and pure women do follow the example of our heroine and visit the outcasts, let them also imitate her in the details of their treatment of these poor creatures. We have represented our heroine as visiting the objects of her solicitude personally. Sometimes she appealed to their intellect, sometimes to their heart, sometimes to their interest. She made it a point to discover the idiosyncracies of those with whom she was brought into contact, and to avail herself of their peculiarities to accomplish her holy purposes. She always availed herself of any accident or incident which occurred favorably to her views. She offered her sinners some practical way to escape from their position. 'She gave them opportunities to work, in the place of opportunities to sin. In short, our heroine acted toward those Cvprians with whom  she came in contact as one human being    should act toward other human beings who had heads, hearts, minds, bodies, feelings, souls, and interests in common with herself; and as the natures of those she visited varied, so did she vary also her manner of treatment. She kept one end steadily in view-the reformation of the erring ; and to that end she availed herself of every opportunity. It is true, our heroine failed occasionally, spite of all her en- deavors. We have recorded some of these failures, and we migrht have recorded many more. But such a lack of entire success is   ,! '   'ERRING, YET NOBLE.                 269 inseparable from every human undertaking, however noble. Especially is this true of all undertakings in which moral reform is concerned. But then, on the other hand, her successes were almost as numerous as her failures. And oh! think how glori- ous was each success 1, A woman restored, a soul saved! One such victory, one only, 'were worth the toil of a life-time. All women who determine to follow our heroine's example, and to endeavor, like heri, to save the fallen ones of their sex, must makeup their minds to encounter very many trials and very many failures. Were an angel to descend from heaven, he could not drive the devil from every abandoned woman's heart; much less can perfect success in such can undertaking attend upon a mere human creature, however earnest, active, and noble. And in every case where they, who would imitate our heroine, would succeed, they must adopt her method. They must ascertain the peculiarities of the individual character of each moral patient; they must ascertain, as far as possible, what cause led her origin- ally to sin; they must see what she most needs, whllat point she is most vulnerable upon; they must avail themselves of their. knowledge on these points, and also avail themselves of every incident that may occur favorable to their design. Above all, they must feel for and with the unfortunates they visit; they must sympathize rather than scorn, heal rather than wound, love rather than condemn. Kindness and charity, gentle words and the magnetism of loving hearts can accomplish more in an hour. than severity, "virtuous indignation," and theological threats can achieve in a year.  And we appeal to the hearts and souls of all truly virtuous and Christian women, and we ask all such,--Is it not their inte- rest, is it not their duty, should they not esteem it their pleasure and their privilege to imitate the example of the pure and loving Christ, " the friend of publicaus and sinners," who went about doing good? Should they not feel for rather than against their "erring sisters,) and give them whiat, of all things else on earth, they most need and most desire-a chance to reform? Let good women listen to the following words of an eminent writer, herself a good woman :  270        EBRMNG, YET NOBLE. "That for a single offence, however grave, a whole life should be blasted is a doctrine repugnant even to nature's own dealings in the visible world." And again: "Let, therefore, a woman once feel that 'while there is life there is hope,' dependent on the only one condition that she shall sin no more, and what a future you open to her!1" The same writer also says: "Surely, the consciousness of lost innocence must be the most awful punishment to any woman. *   * X  * I think this fact alone is enough to muake a chaste womanls first feeling to- ward an unchaste one that of unqualified, unmitigated pity." Thle authoress then proceeds as follows : "Allowing the pity, what is the next thing to be done? Surely, there must be some light beyond that of mere compassion. * * *Where shall we find this light? In the world and its ordinary code of social morality suited to social conscience? Ifear not. *  * *  I believe there is no other light on this difficult question tha n that given by the New Testament. There clear and plail, and everywhere repeated, shines the doctrine thatfor ecery sin, beinzg e'peented and forsa'kez, there is forgiveness with heaven, and, if with heaven, there ought to be with men and wonzen."  And then the authoress solemnly and truthfully re- marks: "When you shut the door of hlope on any human soul, you may at once give up all hope of its reformation." These words, the reader will please remember, are the words of a good, pure, talented woman, and as such we commend them to the attention of our female readers. But let us give some addi- tional exttracts from this authoress. Speaking of the ultra and fantastic delicacy which " respectable" women feel about coming into contact with the fallen of their own sex, or in inves- tigating for themselves the " social evil,' she remarks: ' It may often be noticed the less -virtuous people are, the nore they shrink away from the slightest whiff of the odor of unsanctity. The good are ever the most charitable, the pure are the most brave."  In another place, on this same subject; she remarks: "We," i. e., pure women, "have no right, merci-   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         271 fully constituted with less temptation to evil than man, to shrink with ultra-sanctimonious delicacy from the barest mention of things we must know to eist. " "  * Better face truth at once in all its bareness than be swaddled up forever in the folds of a silken falsehood. * * * Many of us (z. e., women) will not investigate this subject (i. e., the social eviD because we are afraid afraid not so much of being' as being thought to be, especially by the other sex, incorrect, indelicate, unfeminine ; of being supposed to know more than we ought to -know, or than the present refinement of society concludes that we do know. * *   QOh, women, women! why have you not mo0re faith in yourselves, in that strong, inner purity which alone can, make a woman brave ; which, if she knows herself to be clean in heart and desire, in body'and soul, loving purity for its own sake, and not for the credit it brings, will give her a freedom of action and a fearlessness of consequences which are to her a greater safe- guard than any external decorum." One more, and final, extract from the pages of the authoress whom we have so freely quoted, and who, we may here remark, is no less a person than Miss Muloch, the famous writer of "John Halifax, Gentleman," and "A Woman's Thoughts upon Woman." Speaking of the reformation of the erring of her sex, she says : "Magdalene Institutions and the 'like arte admirable in their way, but there are numberless cases in which individual judgment and help alone are possible. * * * All I can do, all that I fear any one can do by mere speech is to impress upon every woman *  * that -repentance is posssble, Also, that once hawr- ing returned to a chaste life, a womai'ls former life should never be 'cast u:p  against her. * * * She should be judged solely by what she is now, and not by what she lias been." So speaks a woman in her "Thoughts upon Woman."  And we commend these words to the attention of our readers. We do not know whether Miss Muloch will ever see this humble book of ours, or whether, if she does see it, she will endorse all our views. But we feel confident that to our cardinal doctrines   272        ERRNG, YET NOBLE. she, and all thinking and good men and women, will most/eartily assent ; which cardinal points of belief are : that err/ women can reform ; that a chance for reformation should, thereforc, be extended to them; that virtuous women can and should assist them in their reformation, and that sympathy and the right hand of sisterly fellowship should be extended to all who sincerely strive to rise. And one thing is certain as a God in heaven, that a Cyprian can never and will never become a reformed woman unless some avenue of employment is opened to her, by which she can sup- port herself after she has abandoned the evil life by which sle has previously existed. In other words, poor sinners will not forsake sin unless virtue will afford them a living. And, there- fore, those who would restore an "erring woman" to society, must give her some fixed, paying, respectable employuellt in the place of her former horrible profession. It is true that this branch of our subject leads us into the ques- tion of female employment, female wages, wonan's rights, etc., etc. But these matters we do not care to discuss. All we have to say on these points is, that the capacities of women for many kinds of respectable labor are very much undervalued ; and that if more avenues of employment were laid open to women, and better wages were paid to them for their labor, there would be vastly less sin among them. One word more. , We hold all those men who employ women, working them hard and paying them light, we hold all these men as little better than soul destroyers. And, more than this, we hold all those who patronize these establishments, merely that the proprietors may be enabled to sell goods cheap, as much to blame almos. as the heartless proprietors themselves. But to return to our original subject. Reader, have we not sufficiently illustrated our point, that one of the great remedies for the " social evil" is the influence and the direct action of virtuous women? And oh I were women fully aware what a blessed and most delicious thing it is to save souls, especially the souls of their poor,    ERRING, YET NOBLE.         273 degraded, painted, wretched, despised,- heart-broken sisters; if they did but know what the joy is, what the glory is, of restoring, to virtue and decent lives and homes the Traviatas of our lanes and streets; could they imagine all this, we verily believe that the number of our unfortunates would diminish one-half in less than a month. It is a glorious thing to be a queen of fashion, to be a leader of the ton; it is glorious to be a famous authoress, and to have the critics and the public at your renowned feet; but it is far more glorious to be called a friend of the unfortunate and a sa- vior of your- sex. It is joyful to be beautiful, to be the belle of your circle, to be sighed for ; it is joyful to be loved by one true heart that lives but for you-that worships you next to its God ; it is joyful to feel the loved one's arm glide around your, waist, to hear the loved one's voice calling you fondly, to feel the loved one's kiss upon your blushing cheek ; but, believe us, it is far more joyful, more joyful than even beauty, than even love, to know, in your own soul, that you possess the undying gratitude of a soul that you have saved, of a sister whom you have restored to ler happiness, her honor, and her God. Believe us, dear lady readers, and believe THS; and for God's sake, at any rate, make the experiment. So much for the fourth means of ameliorating, restraining, and modifying evil. But we have named a fifth means "to the same good end; this last (which we will now consider) being the purifying and devati;ng of the general mnoral tone of society. And first, we would remark that SOCIETY is, to a large ex- tent, directly responsibie for the social evil. Were the tone of society chaste, were the men of fashion and position moral in their lives, were the women of the upper classes really, as well as seemingly, pure in their characters, were the books written by, or read by, these men and women, books of true religion and sound morals ; were the amusements patronized by these classes of a virtuous tendency ; did these- classes but sin- cerely sympathize with those beneath them, especially with poor women, and give them avenues of respectable, well-paid employ 12*    274        ERRING, YET NOBLE. ment; or did the upper classes of society make the proper allow- ances for the temptations incident to the lower classes, and when one of these latter chanced to fall would give them a chance to rise again; did society but frown upon the seducer and the lib- ertine, then would the vice which now curses us be most glori- ously diminished. But as the upper classes are impure; and as all that we have above suggested' is merely suggestion but not fact, do we say too -much when we assert that society (i. e., yourselves and ourselves, dear readers, as part and parcel of this "society") is directly responsible for the existence of immorality. Again, what is called the social evil is by no means the only evil of society. After all, professional immorality (vile as it is, disgustiing as it is), though more low, perhaps, is not one whit more sinful in the sight of heaven than many fashionable sins which do not brinc down upon the offender the wrath of society. In fact, we mnay here remark that the wrath of society is generally in the inverse ratio to the wrath of God ; the rage of society being strongest against those offences (poverty for instance) against which the rage of heaven is mildest, if it rages at all ; and, on the other hand, the ancger of man being very moderate, if not altogether wanting, against sins such as meanness and hypocrisy, against which the indignation of the Almighty One is most intense. Professional vice is an iniquity. Granted; but is it one whit more of an iniquity than many other offences which have more agreeable names, or which are more fashionable?  Such as marrying for money which is an everyday occurrence; such as duelling or heartlessness (the first more rare than formerly, the latter more fashionable than ever);  such as avarice, which is thie great crime of America ; such as swindling, success in which now-a-days is a mark of business talent; or such as many other vices we could mention were time allowed us. Is the social evil (whatever it may be in the sight of fashionable men and women) one whit viler in the sight of heaven than the half-dozen sins we have enumerated? We take the liberty of answering for heaven; and we answer-   NTot!    * * Let us nov define what we e  y a'fd n "  esrlBd0T   e T   le hesuiy aoi b P     Yvting of the general moral tone of 'Mrifing an "       First, e mean that society (p wh/c term we here desn ;5 ii     the upper and middle classes) should abandon or modify varic i i?   *^       t   81^   .

Instead of 'alos ils   276       -ERRING, YET NOBLE. wholly devoting itself to the discussion of mere theological topics, it should principally occupy itself with definite, spe- cific exhortations and counsels against some specific, prevail- ing vice or folly. Priests should preach not so much upon justification by faith, the trinity, the salvation or damnation of the heathen, or other dogmas; neither should they devote themselves (a la Beecher) to politics, " our colored brethren," and "shooting the gospel into every creature ;" but they should warn and preach against the sins which prevail on every side around them, against extravagance, avarice, cor- ruption, worldliness and vice. Thus, and thus only can the pulpit accomplish its proper mission. We need, dear read- ers, many more Reverend George Howards and fewer Henry Ward Beechers. Third, we mean that there should be more communication and interchange of thought and feeling between the upper- and lower classes ; that there should be less pride on the one side, less envy and hatred on the other; that the rich should be more charitable, the fashionable more condescending; that the employers should be more liberal to their workmen and workwomen, and should take more of a human interest in their welfare; that more avenues of employment should be opened; that labor should become more respectable; that, in short, the great truth should be appreciated, that want is the great source of vice. Especially would we have one great fact to be fully imn pressed upon the public mind, the great fact that the re- formation of criminals, whelter male or female, is possible; that the worst criminal is still a human being, and that, if treated as such, anld not as a wild beast, there is a chance for his or her recavery.  In these views we are proud to see that the im- mortal Victor Hugo, the greatest of living Frenchmen, and the author of the wonderful "Les Miserables," fully concurs. Jean Valjean, though a convict, is still a good and great man, though society persecuted him as much after his reformation as before; and it was not the galleys but the good bishop oP   ERRING, YET NOBLH.        2" who reformed him. Fantine, too, was more sinned against than sinning.. There are many American Fantines, who, if society would aid, society would save, but who, as society persecutes them, perish. Doctor Sanger, speaking of the class of women to which Fantine belongs, remarks--' But some moralist will ask, ' How would you have us treat such women?' Treat them, sir, as human beings, actuated by the same passions as your. self; as susceptible beings, keenly sensitive of reproach; as injured beings who have a claim upon your kindness; as out. raged beings who have a demand upon your justice. Lead them into a path by which they can escape from danger, and when this is' done pour out the vials of your hottest wrath on those of yozr own sex, whose machinations have blighted some of God's fairest created beings." These last lines convey an idea which we would impress 3i! upon our readers' minds; an idea which, if carried into prac- tical effect, would most wonderfully elevate and purify the moral tone of society. We mean the idea of condemning tilt  i  male as zvell as the female criminal. Though a very common, yet it is a very strange thing-the manner in which society judges the degree of sin by the SEX of the sinner. If a woman falls, if a wife errs, if a daughter or sister stray from the right most fearfully tempted, most foully wronged, yet for them there is no excuse. Society puts its brand upon them, they are degraded and lost forever. For female criminals there is no pardon for crime; for them   naught remains but death. Though the folly of a moment be expiated by the tears of many years, it matters not; they are branded, they are lost. God may have mercy on them, but man, not being God, cannot afford to be merciful. Such is the fate of the woman who errs. But how differently fares the male offell- j  der!l A lhusband or a brother errs, what matters it!"Men it will be men," says society; " you cannot expect us to be all like Joseph," say the offenders themselves; and: society ad- I.

And thus the man who has betrayed a woman becomes, upon the strength of her certain ruin and probable damnation, more popular than everyl Yea I And women themselves-more shame for them!-adore the successful liber- tine, and thus actually offer a premium on iniquity! Now, this is wrong; it is absurd, most wicled, and yet, alas I it is almost universal. And, until this state of things shall be utterly done away with; until men shall be judged by the same, or rather by a more severe standard even than women are measured by; until the same, or, if pos- sible, still heavier punishment shall be meted out to man for the same offence that is meted out to woman, it will remain an utterly hopeless task to attempt to check immorality.' For it is as certain as the existence of God, or the devil, that while indulgence is given to vice, vice Swill prevail. We must add, in conclusion, that we both conscientiously and reasonably believe that, if the various methods that, in the present chapter, we have suggested for the-lesseningc of vice, and the amelioration of its attendant evils, be adopts ed; (if wise and scientific "legal enactments" be devised and enforced; if men and women marry early and prudently; if women will give their active, and direct influence to the cause of the salvation of their fallen sisters, and if the gene- ral moral tone of society be refined and elevated by the means which we have mentioned,) then the great evil, the mortal sin, which now so frightfully prevails, and of which, in this book, we have so especially and conscientiously, though scrupu- lously treated, will (if not cease to exist), at least, cease to offend our readers and the public by its at once insulting and demoralizing ostentation of the abomi7nable. /    BOOK THE -       TFIFT. !OBILITY ON .TRIAL.

The MSS. was written in a horrible -handwriting, worse than that of authors generally, if possible; but the style was of considerable merit, and the arguments were of much specious power. , Being satisfied with the AMSS., the old man laid it backr and was about to leave the room and go down stairs, when a whim seized him. He turned, and advanced to the corner of the room in which he kept his safe, opened it, and loolkingl among the papers which it contained, found his " last will and testament"- his second will, the will which he had drawn up shortly 'after his strange musical encounter with Julia Witherson, and seizing this paper he placed it in the breast-pocket of his coat. Why lle did so, he would himself have been puzzled to explain. We, all of -us, do many things every day for which we can give no reason. But so he did.  He then locked up the safe, and, putting the key in his pocket, left the room. He found most of the family seated at the breakfast-table, and  taking his place among them, partook of, for him, a very hearty meal, and  was even more brilliantly bitter and sar- castic in his remarks than usual, and conversed much more. freely. After breakfast, leaving word that he would return at two  o'clock, and that shortly after that hour a cart would be  at the door to convey his model-machine  to his office down town, he left the ihouse. But, as he was descending the front steps, he stumbled, and, falling, would certainly have been precipitated against the pavement with a shock sufficient to have killed him had not a passer-by caught him in his arms. With muttered thanks and an uttered curse the old man received his new lease of life, and then hastily wended his way along the streets toward the business portion of the city.    Now, itstrikes us, that had there been no Providence-as Mr Shiner says iu his Essay there is not-the old man's fall just now would have been fatal, and he would never have reached "the business portion of the city."  Take heed, take heed, old man- beware, old Uncle Shine, the Providence which thus far has pro- tected you may some day cease to do so. *  On reaching the city, Mr. Shiner paid a series of hasty visits to the offices of various manufacturing companies, and reminded the gentlemen he found'there of their engagement to be at his ,office at half past three o'clock that afternoon, to witness the working ot the machine which he wished to introduce to their notice. At all the places where he called, Mr. Shiner, spite of his worthless clothes, odd manners, and slovenly appearance, was received with the utmost politeness and respect. For he was known to be very rich; and, therefore, he had a right to be just as slovenly and odd as he chose to be. He then called at the office of his special agent, and gave him peremptory orders to sell at once, for what they would bring in the market, various stocks, etc., which had been given him as collateral for loans which he had made to certain parties-and which had been for some time due and unpaid. True, he had a legal right to do this, but (as he was not in want of money, and as by forcing these stocks now on a depressed market they would be sacrificed ; whlereas if he waited awhile the market would rise, and something could be realized on these stocks not only for him- self, but for their original owners,) it would certainly have been his duty, as a man to his 'fellow-men, to have waited a while longer before proceeding to extremities. But George H. Shiner had never been known to do a single generous action in the whole course of his life ;' certainly not where money matters were con- cerned. So he gave his agent his orders, and his agent had no option but to obey him. "At half-past four this afternoon I shall call for the money." So saying, Mr. Shiner took his departure. The next place the old man visited was the store of Mr. A  , a leading merchant, and, at the same time, a prominent Infidel, a member of the society of which Mr. Shiner was Chairman. The two sceptics conversed for some time on mat- ters of business ; and then, Mr. A  informed his visitor that on that very afternoon, at five o'clock, there would be a special meeting of " the Society of Free-Thinkers."    282        ERRING, YET NoBLE. "All! I am glad of that," said Shiner, " as I have written an Essay I would be delighted to read before the Society." "oWe would be most delighted to hear it," replied Mr. A--. "I will bring the MSS. with me this afternoon. It is at my sister's, but I will get it at dinner time, and will read it this afternoon. It is not long." Shortly afterwards Mr. Shiner left, and, as he had at last gradually advanced into the neighborhood of his own office, he entered the large, well-furnished room which bore his name in- scribed conspicuously on a plate outside ; and, seating himself by the table, read and answered one or two letters which he found waiting for him. We have styled -Mr. Shiner's office ' a well- furnished room ;" so it was-everything about it was fitted ihl the best style. Still, we repeat, Mr, Shiner himself was a miser, a lover of money for money's sake; but he had lived long enough to know that show is necessary sometimes to secure substance; though he begrudged a cent where it was unnecessary, lie would spend hundreds of dollars where it would pay him well to do so ; he thought it would pay to have a showy-looking office, and -. consequently he had one. This is his own private office, and has nothing to do with Shiner & Kincarde's Factory, which is- at some distance, and where Mr. Kincarde is to be found. Having attended to his correspondence, Mr. Shiner glanced over the papers, received several business calls, and then, leaving directions with his clerk, departed to call at various banks and other business resorts. His mind was as active to-day as it ever was in early manhood ; he was as keen, worldly, success- deserving, heartless, and Godless now as at the age of twenty- one. At half past twelve o'clock Mr. Shiner returned to his office, and, telling his clerk that he would be back at three o'clock, left, to pay a visit of inspection to some houses that he was having built in the lower part of the city. As we have before remark- ed, Mr. Shiner was, for his age, very active, so he determined to walk rather than ride to his present destination. The day   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        283 was gloomy--but did not seem likely to prove rainy-and our old sinner made good time. As he walked along, passing the entrance of a court, a group of children, full of noisy mirth, brushed against him-; and, strang'ely enough, thoughts of his own childhood, reminiscences of the days of his own youth among the hills of New England, rushed to his mind as they had not rushed for years, and made him, old and hardened as he was, feel as though hle were a boy again. Wonderful I wonderful I Surely some crisis of his life must be approach- ing when such a man experiences such feelings. But they do not last long--"Shiner is himself again 1" Shortly after this, on his way towards his houses, a specimen of ragged humanity, called " a beggar woman," meets him, and asks of him " charity, in God's name."  "Charity" of a man who has never given one dollar away benevglently for over seventy years!"In God's name," too, when the person she ad- dresses has never been able th decide, in his own mind, whether there be such a Being I Of course she obtains nothing--but beingr persistent in her supplications, the old man raises his cane, as if to strike her. And then she curses him. "May you die soon, and may the devil take you."  Such was her precious prayer. "Die soon," muttered the old man. "Fool I I am good for ten years yet. And as to the 'devil,' if there is one, why then he may 'take me.' " And he thinks no more of the beggar woman or her curse. But he remembers his piano needs tuning*, and that a tuner lives near. So he calls upon the man who exists by repairing the injuries of musical instruments, and, giving the residence, desires him to call at seven this evening, when lhe will be ready to receive him ; for no one shall touch his favorite piano saving in his own presence. Ite then proceeds on his way. He sees a crowd a little beyond him, a crowd who are gathered round the door of a house.  He understands the reason at a glance. A hearse stands in the street. Some one is being taken to his long, last home. He inquires, who is dead? . They tell him, an old man.  Moved by a strange impulse he asks, "How  ld was   284    :    ERRING, YET NOBLE. he?"  "Seventy-one years," is the reply-just his own age Singular coincidence! How does he know that he " is good for ten years yet" of life? At any rate, here he is now at his houses. They occupy a portion of an open lot, and stand a little back from the street. They are only partially advanced towards completion; are as yet only in what may be called a skeleton condition. 'There have been no workmen employed upon them recently--but he intends putting a gang of men at work next week. He has visited them to-day merely to see how they look, and to decide as to whether he will erect some more houses on this lot (which he owns), or not; partly, too, for- the walk; partly, too, be- cause it was a whim. He has been quite whimsical to-day. Having examined the buildings from the outside, he enters them. He also (partly to inspect the houses more thoroughly, partly to obtain a view of the neighborhood, and partly again from a mere whim) ascends by means of a ladder to the upper stories. As the lot on which the houses stand is somewhat ele- vated, he has a good view of the vicinity. And as he looks upon the crowded blocks, his breast expands with pride as the thought occurs to him that he has money enough to buy them all. *    *   *    *   *   ,*    * Time passes on. It is two o'clock. But Mr. Shiner has not returned home-lunch waits for him (he always lunches at home); Mrs. Kincarde wishes to see him, so does her husband ; but he has not come. A quarter past two, and the cart has arrived to convey his model machine to his office, according to instructions. He is generally a prompt, punctual man; but probably he. has been detained by business. He sometimes is detained half an hour or so beyond his time. A quarter to three; still he has not arrived. Mr. Kincarde is obliged to be at the factory by three o'clock, so, having taken his lunch, he departs. Eliza exclaims, "Why, what on earth can leep old uncle Shine?"And her mother replies, "Why, really, I cannot imagine." But a step is hbard in the hall. "Ah, that is he,"   ERRIONG, YET NOBLE.        285 they both exclaim  together.  It is a man, certaily--but not the man they expect. It is the man who came with the cart, and who now comes to tell them that, being tired of watiting, he guesses he will go away, as it is after three o'clock, and ho can get another and a better job elsewhere in a few minutes. So he- drives off, and again Eliza Kincarde exclaims, "tWhy, what on earth can keep old Uncle Shine?" His model machine waits for him in his room. There, too, is the MSS. essay, which proves that there is no such a thing as a Providence. There, too, is Tom Paine's Age of Reason. There also his " safe," filled with money and valuable papers. "But where is Uncle Shine?" Three o'clock, and in Mr. Shiner's office sits his clerk, expecting every moment the arrival of his employer. It- is just the time at which he said he would return ; the very time by which he ex- pected certain work to be donei which work the clerk has per- formed, and of which he is ready to render an account. A quar- ter past three-certainly Mr. Shiner should be here now. Fo)r lie wishes to look over his clerk's memoranda as to varioius mat- terls, prior to his meeting the manufacturers at half-past three. It is very strange that he is so tardy this afternoon-very strange indeed. It is half-past three-and still no M-r. Shiner- and the clerk in wonder asks himself, "Why, where on earth can the ' old boy i bIe?" Half-past three; and a leading manufacturer, a portly, pomp- ous, rich man, one of the chief of those whom Mr. Shiner wishes to conciliate and favorably incline towards his model machine, enters the office, expecting to be welcomed by Shiner himself, and meets merely his clerk-no signs either of the machine. Can he himself be too early, or too late? No ; his gold watch tells him that it is just half-past three-just the time appointed. Strange, very strange I Presently another manufacturer enters ; then another, then a fourth, then a fifth. The number is com- plete. All but Mr. George H. Shiner himself. '- And yet it is a quarter to four. The clerk apologizes and does his best; but that is bad enough.  A bell hard by strikes four. Why,   286        ERRING, YET NOBLE. what on earth can Mr. George H. Shiner mean by making en- . gagements with distinguished men, whose every hour is valu- able, and then breaking them in this manner? It is " not the thing"The clerk again does his best. Shiner keeps in a closet in his office some excellent cigars and some capital wine (keeps them, miser as lie is, on precisely the same princplelo as he supports a showy office, as before explained), and the clerk dispenses them. Still wine and cigars cannot compensate for loss of time, and an almost personal slight, such as Mr. Shiner has this day subjected his visitors to, by his non-attendance. No apology or explanation either. It is too much. And, after, a while, the manufacturers depart, asking, "Why, what can be, the cause of old Shiner nacting so strangely?") Half-past four. And Mr. Shiner's special, private, confiden.- tial agent sits waiting for his principal--who should be here now for his money.  Accordinng to Shiner's instructions, the agent has sold the " collaterals " he holds, and though he has secured quite enough to cover Shiner's loan upon them, the inte- rest of the original holders in them is entirely sacrificed. But what will Shiner care for that? Several families have been legally reduced to beggary. Bat what will Shiner care for that? The agent has the money-ten thousand dollars in bankable funds-ready for him. And yet old Shiner comes not to re- ceive his treasures. And the agent asks himself, "Why, where can the old Shylock have gone to?" Five o-clock. And in their room, or " hall," as they call it, the "Society of Free-Thinkers," as they style themselves, are assembled. Oh I a delightful set they are, truly! A very pleasant class of the community 1 Men, old and young, and, alas I a few w   ,omne, who believe neither in heaven, hell, or humanity, and who meet at stated periods to confirmn each others errors. But Shiner, the " eccentric," as he is mildly named, is absent. Now, the eccentric Shiner is a man of mark among the Free- Thinlkers; for it is a surprising fact, that enlightened Infidels revere money and its possessors just as much as do the benighted   'ERRING, YE  Nr'OBLE.       287 Christians I Besides, Mr. Shiner really writes well, and is quite an intellectual champion of Infidelity. But the services proceed. Blasphemy is spoken boldly, and openly applauded. And, at last, with a mock prayer to a mock god, the meeting is dissolved. While Mr. A   , upon whom Mr. Shiner called this morning, leaves the hall, muttering, spite his professed disbelief in a devil, --" Where in the devil is Shiner?' Where in the devil is Shiner? Let us see if we can answer this question. *- *    8    e   *;   *   *    * We left hinm in his new houses. He is there still; but not in the upper stories. No-he is in the cellar, or, rather, in the place, the opening in the earth, designed for the cellar hereafter.  And, somewhat strange to say, he is lying there- not standing, not sitting, but lying-and in by no means a graceful or comfortable position. He is asleep.  Oh, yes, pro- bably. For he does not move.. And vet it is a very strange place to fall asleep in 1 A very odd place indeed. We do not remember ever to have come across a place more unsuitable for repose than this! Oh I a very singular place indeed for a sleep- ing apartment! It is rather cold and damp, too; especially towards evening. Yes, rather cold and damp. We should much prefer, for our own part, to go to sleep in a more orthodox and usual style. But then Mr. George H. Shiner always was a strange man I Why sleeps he there? Does -he not remember that lie ought to have attended to many matters this very afternoon? Why was he not home at two o'clock to lunch? Did he hunger and thirst no longer, that thus he regarded not his meat and drink? At any rate,.he should have remembered to have at least seen that his model-machine--that machine to which he has devoted years, was taken to his office. Why sleeps he there? Why did he not meet his clerk, according to appointment? Why has he offended thericl manufacturers by disregarding them? Why- did he not call at his agent's and get the ten thousand dollars, for which he ruined several families? It would be so pleasant   '288        E:RMK^2 YET NOBLE. to count them this evehi hen he is alone in his room I Why sleeps he here? Why did he not meet the Infidels this after- noon, and prove to them from his MSS. there, there is no Pro- vidence, no God, no Heaven, Hell or Hereafter? Why sleeps he here? Why does he not rise and go home? But does he intend going home at all? Six o'clock strikes. From the Catholic church in the neighborhood peals the vespers. He always hates the sounds of a church-bell. Surely this hateful sound-hateful, we mean, to a member of the "Society of Free- Thinkers"--will arouse him. But no, it awakes him not. Still in the cellar lie sleeps; while from the church unto the heavens goes up the peal of the vespers I An hour passes on-seven o'clock. Sleeps he there still? Has le no thought of the alarm his absence is causing his family? Does he not know that his sister, Mrs. Kincarde, and his niece, Eliza, are anxious concerning him? Mr. Kincarde has casually met this afternoon-with one of the vexed manufac-. turers and with the agent of Mr. Shiner, and they have both informed him that Mr. Shiner did not keep his engagements with them. This, coupled with his non-fulfilling his promise to be at the house at two o'clock, alarm Mr. Kincarde seriously. Besides, the tuner has come, to heal the discordant woes of his favorite piano.  This thought surely will aroused him. Does he not adore music and love his piano? Still he sleeps. Strange I how soundly he sleeps, with his hat crushed; and separated, yes, separated, from his constant corn. ,panion, the umbrella.  His old-fashioned,- long-tailed, thread- bare coat,' buttoned close; his short, dirty, drab pantaloons; his dirty, clumsy boots; these enclose him. There he lies ; short, ugly, thin, ungraceful as ever ; there he lies, doubled up, or con- torted strangely, and with his odd, old white head against that stone.  But do not examine that head too closely to see if it be bruised or crushed or no; neither lool upon his eyes, or else you might think something horrible.  God I you might even think that instead of being a/leep, he was dead! And that, of course, cannot be, you knov   usiness men and rich men   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         2.9 nevetr die. The shadows of evening cover the earth-still he sleeps in his own cellar. The people pass by to and fro on their ways homeward. Still he sleeps in his cellar. But what of that? 'Tis but a whim. For rich men and business men neve. die. But we tell you, you are mistaken. Rich men do die some- times. And as surely as Croesus of old died, so surely is George H. Shiner at this very moment lying dead in his own cellar. We left him in the upper story of the house. Makinga sudder movement, he lost his footing, and fell from the third stors through the openings in the beams which were to support the second and first floors, clear into the cellar, and, striking his head violently against a stone, perished. Thus died George H. Shiner, in the seventy-first year of his age. Full of years, money, sins, talent, energy, unbelief and hardness of heart. Now, gentlemen and ladies, we can answer you your ques- tions. Eliza Kincade, you asked this afternoon, "Why, what on earth keeps Uncle Shine?" We answer, Death keeps him.   And Death will keep him Clerk, you asked, "Why, where on earth can the 'old boy' be i"Why, dead in his own cellar. The manufacturers wished to know " the cause of old Shiner's acting so strangely." We reply: He acted so, because  he could not ]hel it. The agent- asked, "Why, where can the old Shylock have gone to "  To the place where many other Shylocks have gone before and since. The  Infidel inquired, 'Where in the devil is Shiner?" We answer emphatically, Shiner has gone to the devil. In his room the model-machine rears  its proportions; the piano waits for his touch upon its keys; the "safe" is full of money and  valuables; Tom Paine's "Age of Reason  " is in its accustomed place--but the machinist, musician, merchant, and Infidel, lies dead in a cellar. We wonder if he believes now that there is a  Providence? Ve wonder now whether he would not be better pleased with himself had he been liberal and honest, instead of a cheat anda 13   290        ERRING, YEr NOOBLE. miser? We wonder if he does not now believe in the existence of a God, and of a devil? All we know is, that 'tis very dark and cold, and that old Shiner lies dead in the cellar of one of his new houses. -      e  ,     *       8 When Mr. Shiner's will was read some days after his funeral, his principal heir was found to be Julia Witherson. *a   ERERING, YET NOBLE.       29] CHAPTER -II. WAR. THEY fired upon Fort Sumter. Yes, the Rebellion had begun--the great Rebellion-the greatest, fiercest, strangest civil war that earth has yet known I Ye%, the extremists of both sections had succeeded in their darling object; they had attained the end for which they had struggled 'so many years, At the first sound of war the enthusiastic poet, Charles Singerly, whose loss of his Jlovo had made him careless of his life, and whose sense of duty drove him to arms, became a soldier. And while he fought the foe at the South, his friend, Hericot, in the North, stayed at home trembling, and, amongst his intimates, laughed at the Quixotic Charles, and reviled his cause. And while he risked his life, Kate Somers, the woman who had for so long sought so earnestly to marry him, never once gave him a thought, but flirted gaily on with all the beaux that fortune sent her. She would not have cared, not she, had he died in battle, or lain delirious in a hospital. It was but lis money she regarded-that out of her reach, she recked not a whit for the man. Charles Singerly became a soldier; and he learned by experience what we call " the horrors of war." Do .you know what these are, reader? If you do not, thank God: for your ignorance, and pray that you may never be made wiser! Oh I of all damnable sights that are seen upon this earth (which the Calvinists tell, us was made but to be damned-) a battle is the most atrocious. Man, made in the image of his i   29.2       ERRING, YET NOBLE. Maker, formed in the likeness of a god of love, deliberately, or in the heat of an artificial fury, stabbing, shooting, maim- ing with Ihis devilish instruments his brother, not because they have injured each other I oh, no, but because, forsooth, they have different kings, or different politics! And so they use the argument of the bullet and the -eloquence of the sword, the logic of the bayonet and the convincing converse of the cannon I They differ, and, therefore, of course, they must shoot, and be shot at. Oh, God I we cannot tell whether a battle is most absurd or most awful I As for glory, when will the world learn there can be naught glorious in murder, retail or wholesale-? And what were Caesar, Charles XII, and Napoleon Bonaparte but wholesale murderers ; slayers of body and of soul? Oh, heaven! the amount of anguish which these men have caused upon earth I How they have filled the hospitals with shrieks and yells of almost demoniac suffering; how fever and fracture, and de- lirium, and every conceivable form of sickness and sorrow have been indebted to these men I Far away from the battle, in thousands of humble, haughty homes, how has the face of the mother, wife, sister, daughter, or beloved one yet dearer, grown white with heart-horror as they have read the long list headed by the short, simple, sharp word "killed!"And all this wholesale slaughter to gratify the whim of some great hell-hound I When will the world learn that the very worst use a man can be put to is to be made a soldier of? When will the Christian learn that the only pretext that can render a war anything else than a murder is self-defence? Only as a defensive war is the very one we have waged justifiable. Charles Singerly became a soldier for the protection of his 'native land. He studied military matters constantly; was precise in his discipline; was active and brave; was a war- rior from principle. For a while he forgot even his loved literature, and acted instead of wrote. His thoughts would often turn homeward to his friends, his mother and Julia.  '    i         ERRING, YET NOBLE.        293 With the two first he maintained a constant correspondence ; but he allowed no sentimentalities, no home-yearnings to interfere with his duty. Ho was (what has since become rare, very rare) a faithful, hard-working, hard-studying, sober, brave, thoroughly respectable volunteer officer. At last, after a very brief, but honorable career, he was wounded in a skirmish in Virginia, seriously wounded, and he was carried to a farm-house in the neighborhood, where his injuries were medically treated. As fate would have it, this very farm-house was part of the property bequeathed to Julia Witherson by her father, and had been, since his deatlh, occupied by a distant relation. Thus, Capeain Charles Singerly, when wounded, found shelter in the house of the woman whom he loved, the wonman who loved him, and yet the woman who could never be his on earth. "Well, if I die," he thought, " she shall be mine in heaven."   294        ERRTNG, YET-NOBLE. CHAPTER       III. SICKNESS. A FEW days passed, and it became known in New York that Captain Charles Singerly, the poet, was wounded. The newspapers stated the fact, and praised his heroism. Miss Kate Somers heard the news, and cared not-it was nothing to her. Henry Hericot, esq., when he learned the in- telligcence, remarked, with an oath, "that the fool Singerly had received the reward of his folly." But when 'the Rev. George Howard heard that his friend was wounded "I seriously," he determined to go to him. Howard was a true friend. His breast was full of every noble and gene- rous emotion. lNo false system of theology had cramped and dwarfed his warm human nature. He had not, like many cler- gymen, become less than a man in seeking to become more. And so, when he heard of Charles' dangerous sickness, he re- solved to make his home for a while at his side. He procured a substitute to serve Ihis church in his absence, and then departed for "the seat of war," accompanied by Charles' mother. Mfrs. Singerly, as before hinted at, loved her child, her only son, Charles, with a love passing the common love of woman. Formerly lhis dissipation had given her pain; but as he had of late abandoned his wild habits, this cause of anxiety was with- drawn. In her eye, he was now almost perfection. But when his country summoned him, when he felt called upon to leave his mother for his native land, she shed some natural, bitter tears, yet she was, after all, one of America's many patriot women, and she gave her child to her country. A h! reader, many a mother has performed this sacrifice; many a loving, delicate woman, from Maine to Maryland, has surrendered the dear one   ERRM, YET NOBLE.         295 of her eye, the idol of her parental heart, to the stern demands of duty. She has fallen on his neck, she has kissed her child's loved face ; she has fondled, lovingly, with her fingers, his hair, as she was wont to do in the days of his boyhood; she has folded him to her heart in a passionate embrace ; she has 'utter. ed a few wild words in her anguish ; has commended him to the keeping of the God of Battles; and then, with a mother's bless- ing, has sent him from her presence, perhaps, God only knows, forever. Thus it was with Mrs. Singerly. And now, when she o heard that he was wounded, she fainted not, she showed none of woman's weakness. "I will go to my boy," she cried ; " now, indeed, he will need his mother."  And in company of the Rev. George Howard, she departed to her suffering son. When they reached Charles he was delirious. And in his delirium the character of the man appeared conspicuously. Now he would rave on some literary theme, some poetical theory, or romantic, or philosophical subject. Anon he would call, in stirring tones, to his troop, as though he were with his brave men, heading them  and rushing upon the enemy. Then he would talk and laugh gaily, as though holding a morning's con. versation with his friend Hericot. Then, he would utter some noble and generous sentiment, or would fancy himself aiding some poor man or woman, or saving some wretch's life. Then he would call tenderly upon his mother (though she was beside him and. he knew her not), and, ever and anon, he would name, oh, how lovingly and passionately, in his delirium, the ever-dear name, "Julia 1"' - He would imprint upon her imaoinary brow imaginary kisses, and would give her every endearing title. As be tossed, to and fro, those who stood by his bed saw hang- ing on his breast a little gold locket. His mother recognized it as the gift of Julia Witherson to her son. And when she saw this locket, which Charles had always worn next his heart, 'midst all the din of battle, the mother felt more vividly than ever be- fore how dearly her son, spite of all, did love, and ever would love Julia. And though in his delirium, Charles kept calling, constantly and passionately, upon his dear one's name, yet, as   296        ERRING, YET NOBLE. though some subtle instinct warned him even in his frenzy that strangers to her secret were around him, he never uttered a word relative to the cause of her separation from him; he never spoke ,a syllable that could compromise her. The Rev. George How- ard learnt nothing from the sick-bed revelations of Charles Sin- gerly that could throw any new light upon the misunderstanding or separation which existed between the lovers. He learnt nothing of the stain that existed on Julia's early life. He learned simply that Charles loved her passionately-and that lie knew before. Our hero's mother and his friend nursed him and tended upon him day and night. He was even more handsome now than when in health. His eyes were more expressive, his mouth more exquisite, his classic, intellectual face more truly beautifull. Sick- ness did not take away the grace of his form, nor rob his voice of its accustomed music. Day and night his friend and mcther, aided by a skillful physician, tended upon him; and, at last, Charles recovered and was himself again. He embraced his mother, and welcomed her with all the swelling tenderness of his loving and dutiful heart. He embraced his friend with the affection of a brother. He detailed to his interested auditors the story of his adventures (though he modestly said as little about his own warlike achievements as possible) ; and then he questioned them about "home," about his friend, Hericot,. and kindred matters. And, though he said nothing on the subject to his mother, he was continually asking the Rev. George How- ard concerning Julia-Witherson. And his love was rendered more evident to Howard at every inquiry. Reader, there are certain facts in the future which can safely and certainly be pro- phesied from our knowledge of human nature; and amongst these is the fact that Charles will cease to love Julia only when he ceases to live. Charles was blessed with that very rare blessing, a really skillful physician, brought from New York, " at great expense,'; by his mother. Our hero promised to do well. The doctor soon announced, in a learned, pompous style, his belief in Charles   ERRrSG, YET NOBLE.        297 ultimate cure; took unto himself the lion's share of the credit, and left with the physician of the place minute instructions as to the further treatment of the patient (among these was the warning that he might possibly have a relapse, in which case be, Dr. K---, -must be sent for.) Then, advising that Charles should not be moved for some time to come, Dr. K-- , having received a liberal bank check from Mrs. Singerly, took his de- parture for New York, while Charles still remained upon his sick-bed in Virginia. But another and a yet more skillful physician stayed with him -a physician of souls-a clergyman-his friend, the Rev. Geo. Howard, who was now needed in his professional capacity. For Charles SingerlI began to meditate upon religion. In health we may be careless on religious matters, but when we lie -vibrat- ing between life and death, we then give these topics our careful thought. Not like cowards, who are frightened, but like sensi- ble men, who are led to see old things in a new light. And thus with our hero. He had lived a non-religious man. His disposition, his youth, his associates, tended to render him thus. But it was chiefly the number of hypocrites, and the narrow, unphiloso- phical and bigoted creeds which disgusted him. He saw that the world, though nominally Christian, was really almost heathen. Still, he was far from being positively irreligious. JiHe was no skeptic, differing in this respect from Hericot, whose infidelity gave him pain. He respected religion, also, for his mother's sake. He was a literary student of the Bible; believed, in a general way, in a God and judgment; was a noble, generous fellow, and had all the seeds of good- ness within him. And now, as he lay upon his sick-bed, he began to think whether, after all, he was right in his religious carelessness. He remembered that his friend Howard had once said:  "If this world is evil wilh religion, how much worse would it be without it? Hypocrisy itself is but a base compliment to piety I But hypocrites are not the true test of Christianity;   298       ERRRNh, YET NOBLE. religion is not responsible for them. Judge Christianity by its saints, not its sinners. Read the Bible thoughtfully, and ask your honest soul if its precepts be not worthy practice? if the world would not be wiser were the Bible its alpha; if earth would- not be Paradise were the Bible its omega? Does not the Scripture lead a man to honor while mortal? Does it not bring a man to peace in death, and to bliss in immortality?" He remembered that his friend Howard had once said this; and he now asked himself whether his friend Howard had not spoken truth? So Charles, having become a patriot, now became a Christian. Our hero asked if it was necessary to join a particular church or sect. Mrs. Singerly, like most religious people, answered. "Yes," decidedly, and suggested the Episcopal church. The Rev. George Howard said, on the other hand, "that it was not necessary-that a form of reli- gion, a sect, is to true religion what a coat is to a mana; one may wear a coat of this fashion or of that, or no coat at all,. and still be a man; that it was entirely discretionary this 'joining church,' the great point being to lead a good life." This struck Mrs. Singerly as being very strange language for a clergyman; probably it may seem so to our readers; but we believe it to be the truth. So Charles, the Christian, did not become Charles the sectarian. There are many varieties of religion in this world. Thus, the religion of Kate Somers, false, formal, producing no effect upon her heart and life-a religion more abominable in the sight of heaven than even Hericot's Atheism. 'Then the religion of Mrs. Singerly, true, sincere, orthodox, biUt some- what too narrow and conventional. Then the religion of Julia Witherson, more practical than theoretical, a noble, generous creed. Then the religion of Charles Singerly, a poet's faith. Lastly,Jthe religion of the Rev. George How- ard, utterly own-conventional, not orthodox in the usual sense, totally free. from bigotry or formal trammels ; a creed of con-   tJIKlJNlu, YET NOBLE.           MY J mon sense, fitted for the world, practical, at the same time poetical, soul-filling, heart-touching, Scriptural!     Need we say that the last is best? But enough   on this point.  Let us go back   a few weeks, and  betake  ourselves for awhile to New York and Julia.  UVU        ERRING, YET NOBLE,.  CHAPTER IV. TWO MEETINGS. OUR heroine has, of late, devoted herself to three objects in life-her studies, her efforts at reformation among the sinful of her sex, and her love for Charles Sinogerly. Her studies, as we have before hinted, have always been of a wild, metaphysical nature ; branches of learning not often essayed by either male or female scholars. She is sufficiently az fait in the every-day knowledge of the world, in the lore of modern so- ciety; but her prime speciality is the learned discussion of ab. struse metaphysical questions, which have little or nothing to do with the ordinary affairs of life. These wild studies may origin- ally have contributed (by unsexing her mind and bewildering her intellect) to her early false morality and youthful error. But- she pursues them now for the purpose of creating a mental element about her which would contrast utterly with the sad realities of her life, and thus, by the very contrast, soothe her spirit. Julia has a powerful mind, and her attainments in this* peculiar lore are really amazing-almost as wonderfifl as her skill in music, that skill which has so strangely made her a rich* woman. And, speaking of our heroine's wealth, we must say that she spends it in a royal manner. Her dresses are magnificenlt, though as modest and tasteful as ever. She has completely changed the appearance of her uncle's house in its interior ; for she has sump- tuously re-furnished i; from top to bottom. She has also pur- chased a fine pair of horses and a most elegant equipage. Also a large library of the rarest and most superb books. We 'must confess that Julia is somewhat extravagant ; but then she is-so charitable. She supports a regiment, almost, of poor men and women; she contributes liberally; she assists the deserving. -   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         301 And her money, too, is most useful in her labors among the fallen of her sex. By its means she is enabled to render those she saves independent of the necessity of living by sin. Her generosity preserves them from evil. Long may she flourish. We wonder if the departed Shine., that heartless miser, ever sees the careless, extravagant, generous manner in which his money is expended! If he does, how his avaricious ghost must groan!  As to our heroine's love for the man of her heart, the only man she has ever really loved, need we say that time has only strengthened this passion? Their separation, the mother's ban, --what are these? Human hearts do not love only when hu- man bodies are together ; the spiritual can survive the absence of the plhysical--love knows no ban. From the day that they were parted by the mother's act, Julia has never ceased to think of Charles, to read every line of his books, to feast her eyes upon him as often as possible (even though at a distance, or furtively, or but for a moment, though they seldom met, and still more rarely spoke), and especially was she delighted to hear from him through their mutual friend, the Rev. George Howard. And the hope of her life is her tthought that some day her lover's mother, with her prejudices softened, her heart moved by their patient love, her soul appreciating the reformation of Julia herself, and, especially, appreciating Julia's peculiar mode of ex- piating (of which she cherished a vague idea of causing Mrs. Singerly to be informed), would withdraw her ban, accept the daughter, and make happy a son. That Charles loved her, Julia never doubted ; that he ever would love her faithfully, the in. stinct of her heart taught her. All will come right at last. Such was her hope on earth, her prayer to heaven. When the war broke out, she, knowing her lover's manliness, felt convinced that he would not be idle in the quarrel. And one day when she received a hurried note from him, bidding her farewell, perhaps forever, hqpingo to meet her above, as they seemed destined not to be blest below, and stating that he was "off to the war, she did not feel a. shock, of sumprise. She   UV-     EERRING, YET NOBLE. merely prayed to her God night and morning to guard the new soldier of the Republic, and loved him more than ever. She read the papers with interest, and one day she learned that he was wounded seriously in a skirmish, which had taken place, by a singular coincidence, near the very farm which she herself had inherited from her father. She also learned that Mrs. Sin. gerly, the Rev. George Howard, and Dr.  -- were going down to the wounded hero; and sending for Howard, entreated him to forward her word constantly of his friend's condition. Shortly afterwards she learned, partly by a letter from Howard, partly from the relative who occupied her farm, that at this very farm-house her lover was lying dangerously ill, and that many other wounded officers and soldiers, participants in the recent skirmish, were quartered in the neighborhood. And now Julia Witherson, who was, as we have shown, a bold, original woman, independent in her actions, conceived the idea of going down herself to her farm, in the capacity of a nurse for the wounded. She had, of course, a right to visit her own farm (which she had seen but once since her father's death)  she could do much good, could bring many comforts to the sick and suffering; more than all, her heart whispered, "You can be near him." She acted on this idea. She asked no one to chaperone her. She announced her intention to her uncle and aunt, overcame their opposition, and departed, with a load of medicines and creature-comforts among her baggage, and a load of loving care within her heart. And thus she reached Virginia accompanied only by her faithful, humble friend, young Mary Barton. Julia found the little hamlet in which her farm-house was sit- uated crowded to excess; her own house, being the largest and best in the place, was especially full. So she and Mary Barton took up their abode elsewhere in the neighborhood, making the best of very poor accommodations. Now Mrs. Singerly had discovered before this, that the house whose hospitalities her wounded son enjoyed was owned by the very woman whom she had separated from that   ERRINGT YET NOBLE.        303 son. It was the fate of war. Charles could not be moved. There was no help for it. Besides, Miss Witherson had, through a letter to her friend Howard, in the kindest manner, offered the house and all that it contained to the service of Mrs. Singerly and of her son. But, nevertheless, our mother felt it to be an unpleasant position. At last she and Miss Witherson met. Both were most embarrassingly polite; but under the cloak of formality was hidden deep feeling upon both sides. Still none of the feel- ing showed itself, only the formality. Mrs. S. expressed her great obligations to Miss W., and re- gretted that she must avail herself of it for some time longer. Miss W. expressed her happiness in being able to contribute in any degree to their comfort, and inquired after the state of Mr. Charles Singerly. But, spite of all her efforts, as she asked this latter question, as she uttered the beloved name, Julia's voice had a tender quaver in it which told to Mrs. Singerly's heart with an irresistible eloquence how dearly Julia Witherson still loved her son. Mrs. S. replied that Mr. Charles is now somewhat better; she trusted he would shortly recover, and in this style the conversation pro- gressed. This was the first time that the parties had met since the memorable afternoon in which they had so sadly parted. Both looked at each other with some curiosity. Mrs. Singerly was the same petite, lady-like, elegant, sedate-looking as wo- man, but her expressive face was more care-worn than for- merly. "Our separation and his sickness trouble her," thought Julia. On her side Miss Witherson looked more than wontedly beautiful. Her tall, luxuriant form, her long, dark, rich hair, her graceful pride of movement were un- changed; but her face appeared to have increased in the intelligence, courage and soul of its expression. She seemed like a thoughtful, noble, yet passionate woman, "made per- fect through suffering." "She looks grandly; I ean trace her repentance in her fine dark eyes. What a wife she P 8                    .   S04        ERRING, YET NOBLE. would make :for Charles, had she never erred." So,thougoht Mrs. Singerly; but in a few moments the conversation was at an end.  Both parties, with profoundly-polite bows, separated. Julia read, in the formal manner of Charles' mother a declaration of her unchangeable purpose to keep herself and Charles forever separated. But Mrs. Singerly's thoughts were very different thoughts from what Julia imagined them. She had often heard, since that memorable afternoon, from the Rev..George Howard, and from other sources, of Julia's recent good life, her charity, her peculiar modesty of dress and behaviour, her religious observances and profession. She could not but admire Julia's noble conduct in her confes. sions to her son and herself; she appreciated her refusal to wed Charles without his mother's consent; she felt that she had truly repented of that fatal error of her early life; that since then she had led, and ever would lead a most virtuous and holy existence ; she also felt that her son and Julia loved with an affection that would last till death. That tender quaver in her voice when she asked concern- ing Charles' condition. Her very visit to this place at this time, though nominally to see her farm, and to succor the wounded. These are but further indications of her love. And Mrs. Singerly thought of Julia almost tenderly. "But then, her early error. It may be forgiven, but can never be forgotten.  It is, indeed, fatal. Nothing on earth can ever atone for it. Its memory, like a thing of blight, must, by the laws of God and man, blast her every hour of life. It is hard, but it is just. We  women have great responsibilities. If we meet them not we must meet in their stead with retribution. If we sin we must also suffer. No, no, she can never be his wife." And Mrs. Singerly thouoht of Julia almost sternly. She said nothing to Charles, however, concerning her meet. ing with Julia. In fact, her son was utterly ignorant of. the presence near him of the woman he loved. He thought her,   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        305 of course, hundreds of miles away in New York. He dreamt not of her being almost beside him in Virginia. At last, by accident, he discovered from one of the atten- dants that she, the woman of his heart, the woman for whom lie pined more in sickness than even in health, was living in the same hamlet with him. He also ascertained the ostensi- ble purposes of her visit, but his quick instinct told him what were the real motives, and in his heart of hearts he blessed her.  But he said nothing of. his discovery to either his mother or his friend. But once from his sick bed be caught a glimpse of her across the fields, and he was happy for the rest of the day. And Julia pursued her career of duty, succored the wounded, nursed the sick, fed the hungry, administered spiritual consolation to the dying, daily inquired about Charles from her friend, nightly prayed for her lover, and then dreamed about him the rest of the night., But the relapse of which Dr. K  had spoken, previous to his departure, now took place in Charles' disease; he was taken "sick even uuto death." And suddenly the sufferer turned abruptly to his mother and his friend Howard, who were at his bedside, and said to them, without preface, "Let me see Julia-my Julia. I know that she ifs here. I may die, and I must see her once more before I leave her forever." And his mother could not gainsay him. Miss Witherson was sent for and came, and Mrs. Singerly and Howard retir- ing, the lovers were left alone together for the first time for years. They were face to face. Charles on his bed of suffering; Julia erect, in her health and her sorrow. A"My Julia!" "My Charles!" Such were the simple, heartful words with which they met. They looked upon each other. jjooked, eas though it were i   "-a        .itusl., YET NOBLE. for the last time. Charles, though his sickness told upon his appearance, was still most handsome, most nobly classic in the expression of his features. Soul was stamped upon every line of his lineaments. His eye beamed with the radiant beauty of tenderness as he gazed upon his visitor; and Julia fondly thought that never before had she seen a man so glorious. And Julia herself seemed to Charles more lovely than ever before. Her face assumed an expression typical of her sublime repent- ance and hier pure love. "My Charles!" "My Julia!" And the lovers were locked in a passionate embrace. All the formality that might have seemed proper to Miss Witherson in her peculiar position in regard to Mr., or rather Capt. Singerly, was spurned in the rush of her mighty and lon,-restrained love. All was forgotten save that they were in each other's arms. Julia's magnificent, proud form  was bent over the bed on which Charles was lying.  Her rich, dark hair escaping fromn the confinement of the comb, was flung around her shoulders. It strayed over the breast of her lover, whose exquisite mouth was pressed in a still more exquisite embrace to the ripe lips of the woman whom he worshiped. His arm and delicate jeweled hand was thrown   tightly, but oh I how lovingly around her waist. The rapture of that moment, of that close embrace, that burning kiss, more than repaid them  for their long sorrows.  There is a   divinity in love triumphant which more than atones in a  moment for the agonies of years! One hour of heaven repays in full the life-long woes of earth I For a  while there was silence. At last Charles spoke. "Julia," he said, in a voice of indescribable tenderness; "Julia, my own one, my more than life, I  am dying, I fear. Fear not for my own sake. No, thanks to God, I have made my peace with heaven ; but I do so dread and grieve to leave thee. Thou, who art next to my God; thou, whom I  have loved more and more each day; thou, my dream, my inspiration. Yet the doc. /     ERRING, YET NOBLE.        307 tor tells me that my life hangs on a thread-that in a few days I may be dead. Oh, it is so hard, my Julia, to give up all hope of ever calling- thee mine I For, despite our separation, I have ever hoped as well as loved." "But thou wilt not die, dearest," interrupted Julia, passion- ately. "Nay, Julia; if I do, what matters it? We shall meet above-we shall be joined toogether, if not here, then there! And our union there will be sweeter far-for it will be eternal. Love like ours must be victorious at the last--if not on earth, why, then in heaven!" "But thou wilt not die, dearest," still reiterated Julia, who now indeed felt how truly she loved him. For the idea of his death gave her a shock more bitter than death itself. She now felt how the thought and hope of him had been interwoven with every thread of her life-that he was the source of her repent-, ance, her atonement, her hope--that without him the breath of life was not worth the trouble of breathing. "Nay, sweetest, noblest, purest, do not mind my death. Let that be as God wills. But let us thank God that we have never doubted each other's love, or, truth. Though we have been parted, though we have seldom met, yet we have been true to -ourselves and to each other. Have we not? Throughout our   ; long absence our love has but burnt brightpr day by day. We have lived for each other. Lived and worked to be more wor- thy of each other's love. Is it not so-?" "God knows that you speak truth," was the reply of Julia, as she tenderly kissed the forehead of her lover. "And yet it is so hard, to. love each other thus, and- still be ever parted. Death, on the one hand, a mother's ban, upon the other." "Is there no hope that she will some day be reconciled to our union? Will she never accept my true repentance ; for that it is true, He in heaven can' bear witness 1  Will your mother never become mine?"  Perhaps it was not fitting in the proud Julia to ask such ques- tions as these of her lover. The proprieties of her position and   308        ERRING, YET NOBLE. delicacy may have forbidden their utterance. But love ofttimes proves stronger than etiquette. Passion often bursts the bonds of the "proprieties." - Will not our readers who have loved forgive her? And Charles replied to her questions thus : "Ah, dearest, my mother has learned to respect you-but PREJUDICE, you know, is omnipotent in this world. It can prove victorious over respect, over love itself. And my dear mother, God bless her, has her prejudices. But let us speak not now of this I a m about to die, and I have called you to my bed-side to bid you good-bye-- but not forever-only until we meet again in heaven. Kiss me, my own one, my loved one, kiss me once more." "And, Charles, let this kiss be the token that you forgive me for my early and my fatal sin-that you, at least, accept my sor- row and my true repentance." "Forgive you I I have nothing to forgive. It is I who need forgiveness. Your sorrow, your spotless life for years, your glorious conduct to myself and to my mother, your religion and your charity (of which I have heard from many quarters), these have rendered you, compared to me, with my wild career, my luxurious ease and false self-satisfaction, my sensual sins and open irreligion, as a saint unto a sinner. Ah, Julia, noblest one, it is you who are the pure one of us two. So heaven counts you, and so I regard you. Then, kiss me, Julia, and say that you forgive me." "Nay, Charles, 'tis I who must kneel as I kiss you, and beg your pardon."  And with her lover's arms clasped tightly around her, she knelt beside his couch, and kissed him. It was a long, tender, passionate, burning, rapturous, heart-thrilling, soul-stirring, yet a sad kiss ; a kiss which was mingled of heaven and of earth, of bitter memories--a present joy, a future hope, and a future fear. The sunlight falls upon Julia's splendid hair, which is glori- ously dishevelled; and it plays and dances upon the bed where Charles lies with his lips fast pressed to Julia's. And through the open window is heard the songs of the birds. Happy birds I who are never parted and who never sin I And the fields are   ERRIING, YET NOBLE.        309 green and lovely. Happy fields I ye have neither lips nor hearts I And so it never happens that your lips are pressed together, though your hearts are broken. She kneels ; he clasps her tight, and their mutual love is sealed forever. At last this long, glorious, half-rapturous, half-bitter embrace is over. Charles breaks the silence-thus: "Dearest, if I die, you will, for my sake, think well of and be kind to my mother ; will you not?" "Oh, Charles, I have always loved her, since first you spoke of her. Is she not your mother?" "Keep my memory green, too, dearest. Forget me not when I have gonle." i' lForget you? I shall love thy memory as I love thyself." "You see this little locket. It is the one you gave me. I have always worn it next my heart. It shall always be there. I shall carry it with me into my coffin-into my grave ; perhaps into heaven itself at the resurrection-who knows? One thing more: I shall leave you my diary. No living eyes but your own and mine have ever seen or shall ever see it. There you will learn the history of my life, and the history of my love. There you will see how truly I have loved you." "Ah, Charles, I need' no proof of that. But why talk of death? Oh! something, like a gleam of inspiration, flashes on me, and shows me the future. It tells me that you shall not die, and that we will be happy yet." As though she were, indeed, inspired with a knowledge of fa- turity, her glorious eyes sparkled, and her fine face lightened. For the first time during the interview, she heard the songs of the birds and saw the beauty of the scenery without. "Fond prophetess!" cried Charles, "God grant your vision be a true one. Oh! it is so sweet even to hope to live, only to dream of calling thee mine. Nevertheless," (and he raised his eyes upward), "' not my will, but thine be done.' " Reader, if there ever was a true Christian, it was Charlesq Sin- gerly at this moment. "Promise me, dearest, said Julia, " that, if you recover, as I   810        ERRIG, YET NOBLE. feel you will, you will go to war no more. Something tells me that this war will last, not :for months, but for years. You are not fitted to make a business of man-slaying. You have already done enoulgh. You have a stake in the community. You can serve your country more by your pen than by your sword. At home, I can hear of you, can see you sometimes; for years I have watched your movements." ' And I yours." "But away in the far South, amidst the din of battle, we will be indeed parted. Promise me that you will leave me to decide when it is time for you to return to the field. I love my oountry and your honor. Let me decide when both of these demand your risking death once more. Promise-for your mother's sake -and mine." "I do promise, dearest." "And now, Charles, though I would love ever to be with you, I must leave you." "Not yet, dearest. Remember, we may never meet again." "Oh, yes ; we will meet, and meet to part not. You will not die. But you need rest. I shall be near you. But, indeed, dearest, it is best we see not each other -until that good time comes for which we both are hoping. Let us wait--and work--- and pray-and hope-and love.  And heaven, in its own good season, will soften your mother's heart toward me. The memory of this meeting will keep me in joy until .we meet again, to part no more." "In heaven," cried Charles. "Aye, and on earth, too," answered Julia. "Good-bye." "Farewell forever," cried Charles. "Farewell, but not forever," replied Julia. One kiss-a sigh-a smile-two "God bless you2's--a tight embrace-another tender kiss--a last, long look-and Charles was alone. And the birds sang gaily ; and the air was balmy ; and the fields were green; and the sick man began to hope, indeed, that he might live. And then he sunk back on his couch exhausted.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         3" CHAPTER V. TWO DISCOVERIES. CHARLES SINGERLY recovered.  Dr. K--    was sent for, watched him through the crisis of his relapse, and left him re- stored, though still very weak. Julia thanked God, and took courage. But a new misfortune fell, at this juncture, upon our hero. It is a remarkable fact that troubles seldom come singly. Like cattle, they go in herds ; like wild horses, they rush in droves- in almost armies. Why, we leave philosophy to explain, if it can. We merely state the fact. Charles' agent, the man in whom he had placed for years the utmost confidence, which had/been fully justified, the man -who had the whole control of his pecuniary affairs during his absence, in an evil hour was tempted and fell. In short, the agent ab- sconded-left the country-with the greater part of Charles' funds, leaving our hero and his mother comparatively penniless. In Charles' feeble state of health, they feared to communicate to him this fearful intelligence. But as one disease often drives out from the system the seeds of another, so the news of this calamity caused our hero to almost forget his sickness. And it also brought out, as all great calamities do in truly noble souls, the genuine man, the man of sense and energy, which had for years been concealed under Charles Singerly's elegant, literary, and somewhat indolent exterior. He kissed his mother tenderly-: "Dear mother, I can now have a pleasure which I have never yet enjoyed-the luxury of working' for-you. I have youth, health, a good education, a fair share of talent, a few firm friends.   312        ERRING YET NOBLE. Aye, more than these, I have ambition, determination, energies, which I have never yet used-principles, which I can now put to the test, the smile of heaven, and thy love. What need I imore?" "God bless you, my noble boy. You have not proved false to thy mother or thyself in the hour of trial. Miay the Lord God of Israel bless thee.:' The parent and child were clasped in a holy embrace. Ah, reader, manliness, love, and true religion can support one under even poverty--sudden poverty, that greatest of earthly evils.   .  "Let me but first get well, my mother; and then you shall see that your boy, of whom you are so fond, will not disgrace you in adversity." "As he never has in prosperity." And the mother and son were dearer to each other in that moment than ever before. Howard, too, much as he had always admired his friend, henceforth regarded him with even greater esteem. He told Julia of the calamity which had befallen Charles. "How did he bear the news?" she asked. "Nobly," was the reply," as a man, and a soldier, and a Christian should," "Why did I ask such a question? Did I not know that he would be equal to any fate?" said Julia, as though to herself. Then addressing directly her companion, she asked : "Is he entirely ruined?" I He is not worth over five thousand dollars in the world, He who a year ago was worth twenty times that sum." Singular to state, a smile of happiness spread itself over Julia's expressive face. What-l could she be heartless enough to re- joice in the worldly ruin of the man who loved her? Impossi- ble. And yet, assuredly, she smiled; and certainly her smile was not one of sadness. Howard wondered at her, and left her. "How glad I am." These were her very words, uttered aloud,      ERRING, YET NOBLE.        313 though there were none to hear them, for the clergyman was gone. "How glad I am!" Strange words these from her under the circumstances. Can she be glad that her lover must suirender all his ease and comfort, and suffer affliction? We can hardly answer " yes," and yet these were her very words. The next day Miss Witherson told the Rev. George Howard that she was summoned to New York upon urgent business; and leaving a message of farewell for Mrs. Singerly and her son, our heroine departed to attend to her "urgent busi- lless," Remarkable to state, a smile played continually upon her lips during her journey northward. Hers were certainly happy thoughts. Yet what on earth could be the source of her present happiness? Well, all women are mysteries; and Julia With- erson is especially mysterious I A few days elapsed. Spite of his bad news, Charles re- covered rapidly. It seemed as though the necessity for exer- tion served as a remedy for his disease. As he lay on his couch his mind matured its plans for the future. He had learned the general details of business from his father, who had been a successful merchant. He was himself an author of consid-     i erable celebrity. Between literature and business he could earn a respectable living; or if he continued in the army his pay as captain was something; and he might combine with his official position the post of correspondent to some leading newspaper. But on reflection he abandoned the idea of the army, for, beside the risks attached to it, he must be separated from his mother, who needed his society now more than ever; besides, there was his promise to Julia. No, on his recovery he would resign his commission, and would de- vote himself to business or literature, or both. As for Mrs. Singerly she -gave herself wholly tother son -whom she now loved with a double fervor. Between her love and her religion she found comfort. And the Rev. George Howard ever and anon wondered as he thought of the strange "   * 314        ERRING, YET NOBLE.  . . smile that has passed over Julia Witherson's face when he told her that Charles Singerly was ," ruined." Late one fine afternoon, just as the twiligoht hour was born, a remarkable letter, a wonderful letter, a most astonish- ing letter, reached the farm house, directed to "Captain Charles Singerly." This letter was from a lawyer, and was one of the most brief, important, and astonishing variety; -such a letter as not one man out of a thousand ever receives, and this thousandth man only once in his lifetime. The epistle simply stated that the writer (a lawyer who subscribed himself "W--- D----, New York,") was directed by his client, who, he stated, must remain unknown, to hand over to Captain Charles Singerly, or lis representatives,. checks, money, bonds and stocks to the amount of one hbn- dred thousand dollars, being in payment of a debt due to the family of Captain Singerly by his client. That the money lawfully belonged to Captain igerly, who should have no scruple in accepting it; and that at any rate his client would never touch this money, which must either pass into Captain Singerly's hands, or remain idle. The writer laid particular stress on the fact that the money was not a gift but right- fully belonged to the Singerly family, and concluded by giv- ing his address and stating that he should hold the money subject to the order of Captain Singerly. To. describe the astonishment of Charles, his mother, and his friend, is simply impossible. At first they were almost tempted to think that it was all a dream; but no, there was the letter, a palpable thing enough, and besides Howard was acquainted with Mr. W---   D--, the writer. 'Then the mother suggested it might be a hoax ; but the high, profes- sional character of the writer forbade such a supposition. No, whatever else it was it was certainly a bona fide offer of one hundred thousand dollars. Possibly it might be a gift after all from some generous millionaire who had heard of the sudden and undeserved affliction of the Singerly family,   ruRINGR YET NOBLE.       315 But then, such gifts as these are rare, very rare; and the tenor of the letter militated against such a supposition. Perhaps the epistle said but truth when it spoke of the money as a debt. Mrs. Singerly remembered that her husband had often alluded to very large sums of money due to him. It might be that hearing of their misfor- tunes the feelings of one of these debtors were aroused, and he took this opportunity of repaying his dead creditor by doing justice to his afflicted family. But on the other hand, such acts were most amazingly uncommon, and debts as large as this were seldom contracted, forgotten, and then sud- denly paid in a mysterious manner. The more they thought and talked about this letter, the more they became in doubt, astonishment and surmise; and then the important question arose, "Should they accept this money?"Our readers may wonder that such a question as this should arise, but it must be remembered that neither Mrs. Singerly or her son were mercenary ;- on the contrary, they were very proud, and their pride forbade them to accept money until it was proved satisfactorily to justly belong to them. Suddenly an idea entered into Charles' brain as to the source of this money. It must have been a pleasing one, for he smiled ; but at any rate he restrained his first thought of communicating this idea to his companions, and preserved utter silence in regard to it. About the same time an idea entered the brain of the Rev. George Howard on the very same subject; and he, too, smiled, but was likewise silent in regard to it. But he mut- tered to himself, "Yes, it must be so. I understand all now." "Understand all what?" At last it was determined that Howard should go to New York (as Charles was yet unable to traveD, should see the lawyer, and endeavor to discover all that could possibly be ascertained in regard to this mysterious matter, and should then return and report progress ; and by his report and opi-   316        ERRING, YET NOBLE. nions founded thereon, Charles' course should be guided in the transaction. So Howard departed on his mission. During his absence, which lasted some time, Charles and his mother discussed the letter, and pondered over it, read and re- read its every word. "This sum," remarked Ciharles, one day, "this one hundred thousand dollars is almost exactly the amount that Mr. H , our agent, run away with. Singular coincidence, is it not? Still more singular that it should happen just at this very time." And amongst all the probable, improbable, possible and im- possible sources from whence this money might come, one source especially impressed itself upon Charles' imagination. What this source was we shall soon mnow. One day a letter was received from Howard, stating that -Charles should expect his return within forty-eight hours. This period was one of great impatience to Charles and his mother; but at last their anxiety and curiosity were relieved. Within the appointed time the clergyman returned. At the moment of Howard's arrival, Charles was reclining on a settee, placed nearer the window than the bed had been (for he avoided his bed now as much as possible and substituted the settee); but when Howard entered, our hero, in his excitement, almost arose to his feet, for the first time for weeks. "Have you been successful?"' he asked of his friend. "Have you discovered anything?" "Yes," was the reply ; "I know each and every particular in regard to the mysterious fortune." "Was it a trick?" inquired the mother, who was present. "No, madam," replied Howard. "It is a bona-fide transac- tion." "Is it a debt justly due us, then, as the letter states?" asked Charles. "No," said Howard; " and yet, looking at it in the light in which the giver-----"    'ERRING, YET NOBLE.        317 '"Ah, it is a gift then, after all." "Nay, scarcelya gift either." t"Why, George," cried Charles, " you are as mysterious your- self as the hundred thousand dollars." "Well, listen to me," said the clergyman, "and 'I will a plain, unvarnished tale deliver.' And you will soon understand all. On my arrival in New York, my first step was to call upon my friend Mr. W-- D---- the lawyer. He was not aware of my great intimacy with you, nor of my knowledge of the mys- terious letter, and I kept him in ignorance of both for some time, while I endeavored, in the phrase, 'to pump him,' to ' draw him out.' But it was of no avail. I then threw off the mask, and told him all I knew, and asked him to give me some clue to the mysteriously generous or wonderfully just man or woman." "FWo,na," interrupted Mrs. Singerly ; "I never thought this money might have been sent us by a woman. And yet it may be so." And a new idea- seemed -to have flashed across her brain. Howard continued his narrative. "But Mr. W   D---- D was as silent now on the subject as he was before, even though I told him that in all probability Capt. Singerly would not accept the money until he was aware of all the important particulars concerning it. Still he was mysterious. Then I told him that I had my suspicions concerning the party from whom the money came. Still he was as uncommunicative as the grave. So I left him." "What clue had you now?'. asked Charles. "None at all," replied Howard, " saving an idea which had lain in My brain from' the very hour I first read the letter. And this idea led me to the house of Mr. Russel, where I found Julia Witherson." "Julia," cried Charles. "Miss Witherson!" exclaimed Mrs. Singerly. "What has she to do with this matter?" "Much, very much," replied Howard,. " as you will now see, my very dear madam. For, strange as you may think my pro-   318        ERlRTG, tET NOBLE. ceeding, I accosted Miss Witherson abruptly thus : 'Capt. Sin- gerly has had a fortune thrust upon him of one hundred thousand dollars.' She heard me, and she tried to look astonished, but she did not succeed. - She evidently knew the fact of which I pretended to 'inform her, though none were supposed to be aware of it, saving the lawyer, our three selves, and the man or woman who sent the money. I then said, still more abruptly, ' Miss Witherson, you are the person who instructed Mr. W D  to write a mysterious letter to Capt. Singerly. You are the generous woman who deposited one hundred thousand dol- lars in his hands, to be devoted to restoring the fortunes of Charles and his mother. Can you look me in the face and honestly deny it?' -The suddenness with which I brought this charge against her accomplished mX object. She could not deny, but confessed that I lhad guessed rightly. She begged me not to betray her secret; but on this point I was obdurate. Tell you I would. And told you I have." It would be very difficult to do adequate justice to the emo- tions of iMrs. Singerly when she learned that Julia Witherson, the woman whlom she had regarded as unworthy an alliance with her son, was, of all the millions upon earth, the one who would pre- serve, at the expense of half her fortune, from the evils of pov. erty, the man to whom she could never be united. Wonder, appreciation, gratitude, aye, almost love--these she experienced. But she also felt another emotion-that of pride. Should she and her son accept such a gift, such charity, and from her to whom they bore such delicate, yet unpleasant relations? As for Charles Singerly, this last instance and proof of Julia's nobility of soul, generous self-sacrifice and love, overpowered him. A wild suspicion that possibly she might be the one from whom this money came had entered his mind at the first receipt of the mysterious letter. But it had departed; and though it occasionally visited his mind, it merely came as a vague, possi- ble suspicion. But noiw it was confirmed. This wild idea was a reality. Nearly one-half of her whole wealth (with the fact of Julia's inheritance of -a- large property from Mr. Shiner, of   ERRING, YET INOBLE.         319 course the Singerlys and Mr. Howard were aware) was freely given to the man she loved--in vain. Given, too, secretly and modestly, and unostentatiously. Oh, noble, generous, extraor- dinary Julia I We may here remark, also, that the Rev. George Howard (knowing, as he did, Julia's character, her generosity, her wealth, her carelessness of money, and her love for Charles, coupled with the facts of her singular manner and smile when hearing of Charles' ruin, her sudden departure and the mysterious wording of the note, as' though the party particularly desired conceal- ment) had suspected Julia Witherson from the very hour in which the letter was received. When he exclaimed, "Yes, it must be so ; I understand all now," he referred to this suspicion and to the explanation it afforded of Julia's smile of satisfaction when she heard of Charles' misfortune. Shle smiled, because she felt how sweet it would be for her to aid him. Acting on this suspicion, Howard, during his visit to New York, discovered all. But iMrs. Singerly, after her surprise at the announcement of the Rev. Howard's had subsided, suggested that the letter had stated that the money was in "payment of a debt due ;" also, that " the money was not a gift but lawfully belonged to the Singerly family." Now, as Miss Witherson owed nothing to the family of her son, Mrs. S. contended that the money was a gift, after all, and that therefore a positive deception had been employed by Miss W. The Rev. Howard replied, that he had spoken to Julia on this point, and that she had explained the matter thus: on looking over some of the papers of Mr. George H. Shiner, which had fallen into her possession, she became aware of the fact, that at the time that Mr. Singerly, the father of Charles, died, there existed unsettled accounts between him and Mr. Shiner to the amount of many thousands of dol- lars. As Mr. Shiner himself had never adjusted these accounts, she, as the heir and pecuniary representative of Mr. Shiner, really owed a large though indefinite amount to the representa- tives of Mr. Singerly, senior. 't Besides,' said Miss Witherson,   320        ERRINO, YET NOBLE. "I owe a debt of love and gratitude to Charles, and a debt of duty and respect to his mother, which is as binding as any pecu- niary obligation, and which no pecuniary payment can ever adequately discharge." "Thus, you see," said the clergyman, "that, after all the letter states, according to her views, only the truth. And, oh, you should have seen, or rather heard, how eloquently she begged me not to betray her secret, not to tell you from whom the money came. But I was obdurate on this point-I was obstinate--I was determined that she should not hide her light under a bushel-but that her good works should be made known, at least to you. Was I not right?" "Yes, yes, very right," was all that Charles could utter, so much affected was he. "But," continued the Rev. George Howard, "I have made yet another discovery concerning Julia Witherson, during my recent visit to New York. A discovery yet more astonishing. "Why, what can you mean, George?" asked Charles, in great surprise. "Why, I simply mean to say that, besides discovering that she is the generous donor of those very apropos one hundred thousand dollars, I have also ascertained that she is the principal figure in one of the most remarkable series of scenes known to either ancient or modern times." "i Explain yourself," cried Charles, while his mother became more and more amazed. "Listen, then," said Howard. "After satisfying myself in regard to the history of our mysterious letter, I devoted a day or two to the arrangement of my own affairs. And then I hap- pened casually to meet Henry Hericot, Esq. Charles, take my word for it, that man is a thoroughly unprincipled and heart- less fellow. He asked after you, of course, but with an evident lack of interest, his questions were mere formalities. He thinks now that you are poor, you can do nothing for him. It is my belief that your death now would cause him not five minutes' sorrow." "Nay, George," interrupted Charles, "you always were   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         321 somewhat prejudiced against Harry. You. do him injustice, indeed you do." "Well," continued Howard, "scarcely had I left Hericot when I met Miss Kate Somers, who, like Hericot, was on a 'flying visit' to town for a few days-stolen from the dissipa- tions of the waterinl-places. She, too, inquired after you, but she evidently cares no more for you now than Hericot does. In fact, she is as bad as he is." "Pshaw, George I' again interrupted Charles, "you are foolishy prejudiced against lier, too. But, go on with your story and tell me about Julia." "At last," continued Howard, "I met with William Ralston, whom you know." "Slightly," said Charles. "Ralston is a good fellow, in the main. And in the course of our conversation, Ralston disclosed to me a great secret, an astonishing secret in 'regard to Julia." "Do tell it plainly, for heaven's sake, George, without more ado." "I will, and will try to use, as nearly as possible, Ralston's own words. And here I must ask Mrs. S.'s pardon, if I tread upon delicate, or rather indelicate, ground. But my motive will soon be apparent; and, besides, Mrs. S. has been wife and mother, a woman of experience, and, most of all, a member of thheosine Association. "One night," said Ralston to me, " as I was walking hastily through a street of bad repute, I encoun- teredna veiled, disguised female figure descending cautiously the steps of a notorious house. I had seen this same figure before under similar circumstances, and I had formed a suspicion in regard to its identity. But I had always dismissed this suspi- cion from my mind as utterly wild and impossible. But it would come back-and this night it proved to be truth. The veiled, disguised female figure was no other than Miss Julia Wither son I  "Julia Witherson!" cried Charles, in an indes.,ibable tumult of emotion, of wonder, anger, fear, horror, shame   322        ERROXRG, YET NOBLE. and sorrow. "Julia Witherson I What new agony am I now to bear?" "Miss Witherson "  exclaimed the mother--her mind struggling with a variety of feelings-" can I hear aright " "Yes," continued the clergyman, who seemed rather ma- liciously to enjoy the consternation of his companions; but perhaps in. this we are mistaken. "Yes, Ralston assured me that this figure was Julia Witherson. He followed it, and was rendered still more certain. Yes, it is too true. Tlhe rich, talented, accomplished, religious Julia was thus and then beheld under the most suspicious circumstances i" "Why do you thus torture me?" cried Charles, " do you not know that I love this-woman? Why do you thus bring me, as it were, to the very brink of hell?" "It is because I know that you love her that I have told you this. It is because I am about to show you a glimpse of heaven that I have thus brought you to the very verge of hell 1" replied Howard. "For God's sake explain yourself I Tell me what it is you mean." "I mean simply this, that although Julia was thus seen in the most suspicious places, it was -for a most auspicious and holy purpose. Why, think you, did she enter by stealth the dens of infamy, thus risking her reputation? Why, think you, did- she associate with the vilest and most degraded of her sex; creatures of whom   no other virtuous woman would even, so much as think; women despised by men- and abandoned by heaven itself?. Why did she do all this? I will tell you. It was for a purpose worthy of an angel-a purpose such as actuated a Howard, or a Fry. It was with the design of refolming these wretches. You may think her design an Utopian one, but it was, at least, noble, and she succeeded in it. Yes, Julia, to my own certain knowledge, has brought many a poor Cyprian of our streets to repentance and to virtue. She has accomplished this by almost super- natural displays of patience, prudence, generosity, courage, z.    ERRING, YET NOBLE.        323 love and religion. No woman who has ever lived has dis- played more of these qualities. And for this great design of personally seeking the personal reformation of her sex, and for her sincere, courageous and successful carrying out of this plan, she deserves the honor and the gratitude of all. To most women it would have been a delicate, doubtful, dan- gerous task, likely to cause more scandal than profit, to do themselves more injury than good to others; but to her it has proved a glorious success, the results of which are incal- culable. I speak enthusiastically, for I feel so." "From whence did you derive your information as to this purpose 'of Miss Witherson's, and her success therein?" inquired Mrs. Singerly. "From Ralston in the first place," replied Howard. ' He knew one of the girls in the house firom which he had seen Julia departing.  She told him of AMiss Witherson's purpose. She also told him of some of her acquaintances, once evil like herself, whom Julia's noble efforts had rescued from the downward path. I have myself met some of those she has preserved. And oh, madam, oh, Charles, it would do you good to hear how gratefully these poor saved creatures speak of their saviour.- I tell you that Miss Witherson has con- ceived and executed a plan which marks her out as a genius in goodness; original, bold, yet practical. True, her plan of personally visiting the haunts of evil, 'the dark places of iniquity,5 and those who dwell therein, is hardly feasible to any extent in the present state of society. She was obliged to resort to many devices and shifts, disguises and strata- gems to effect her purpose; still the *plan itself is the only one which can ever succeed to any extent in the reformation of 'erring women.' Perhaps only such women as yourself, Mrs. Singerly, can properly appreciate and understand how prepulsive such a task as this must have. been to such a woman as Julia Witherson ; but as a man and a clergyman I can bear witness that to no woman of whom   I have ever heard or read in the annals of virtue is she inferior. Charles,   324        ERR'ING, YET NOBLE. she loves you, as you know, and you should, indeed, thank God for the love of such a woman." Our readers will bear in mind that it was from a sermon preached years ago by the Rev. George Howard that Julia derived her first practical conception of her woman-mission. It is now by the lips of this very man that she receives her meed of praise for its execution I "Does Miss Witherson know that you   ]:ave discovered this matter? Or are any others beside yourself and this Ar. Balston aware of her singular thlough noble pursuit of this extraordinary scheme?" asked Mrs. Singerly. These were womLans questions, seemingly of no import- ance; yet Mrs. Singerly had her reason for asking them. Howard replied that Miss Writlerson was not aware of his knowledge of a matter which she had never so much as hinted at to him, intimate as he had been with her, and which she had endeavored, by all means in her power, to keep a profound secret; and that with the exception of her atten- dant and assistant, Mary Barton, none knew or dreamt of this matter save themselves. We need not detail the remainder of the conversation. We have said little of Charles' emotions as he made, through the lips of his friend Howard, this second discovery of the true nobility of the woman he loved. We have said little, because words would fail to do justice to the intensity of our heroe's feel- ings. A few hours passed. It is night-and moonlight--and in the little, plainly-furnished room in which he has so long been con. fined, Charles Singerly is alone. He is lying on the settee be- side the window, through* which a flood of light rushes in upon, him. He is thinklinig of the two discoveries of the past day, and of the new revelations of her character, HHe is thinkin on Julia. And his thoughts take words. "I -understand all," he cries, "! understand thee, Julia. T can see thee as thou movest like a thing of light, pure as these moonbeams, amidst the foulest scenes and the vilest creatures. I   ERRBIG, YET NOBLE.        3 can appreciate the shocks thy refined nature must have re- ceived amidst such associations. I can understand how often thy woman's delicacy must have been outraged. Yet thou didst persevere-for the sake of thy own sex, for the sake of heaven, aye, for my sake-mine, unworthy as I am. For thon didst hope to render thyself, as thou wouldst phrase it, more worthy to be my mother's daughter, by means of this good work and grand atonement., Oh, thy course has, indeed, been 'onward and upward,' while I have done nothing. Truly, it is I who am not worthy thee, my Julia. Generous, origi- nal, noble, virtuous girl 1 thou hast touched even my mother's heart of prejudice. I know thou iast, though my mother has said nothing. But I saw it in her face. She cannot resist thee now. And then thy glorious generosity! Thy offer of one-half thy fortune to a beggar I Ah I surely my mother cannot resist this too. And, more thian all, thy modesty, -thy silence, thy secresy, thy desire and endeavor to remain un- known in all thy goodness and in all thy charity. Ah I surely, mother, this must conquer even thee Alh I thou wilt yield, withdraw thy ban, and bless us. Oh! I do hope I After all, it is very sweet to live when there is one like thee to live for, Julia. Oh I I feel now thy words were true. I shall not die, and we shall meet again-on earth-to part no more forever. My God, I thank thee for this hope. Olh, bring it, I beseech thee to fruition!"  And amidst the moonbeams he dreams of Julia.   326         ERR!NG, YET NOBLE. CH-IAPTER VI. A BATTLE IN A SOUL. MRS. SINGERLY'S sentiments in regard to the subject-matter of the important conversation with the clergyman, related in our last, would be difficult to define. At first, they were in a state of chaos ; but, in the course of a few hours, her ideas assumed a certain degree of order and definite consistency. In regarid to the ohundred to te one undred thousand dollars, her thouglts ran thus: As far as Mr. Shiner, from whom Miss Witherson's property came, had owed any moneys to her late husband, so far she (Mits. S.) might, possibly, accept aid from Shiner's representative, aMiss Witherson. But this debt must be first-proved legally; and then its exact amount must be ascertained. But as to accepting any money, as a gift, or under any pretence, from Miss Wither- son herself, personally, the thing was not to be thought of. It was noble to offer the money; it would be degrading to accept it. Besides, under the peculiar relations which Miss Witherson sustained to Mrs. Singerly and her son, the-idea of accepting this magnificent donation was still more wild, and more debasing. No; she must decline for herself and her soni this most generous aid-decline it most gratefully, but, also, most decidedly. And Mrs. Singerly immediately put her thoughts into execution. She wrote her ideas on this matter in the shape of a respectffl, grate- ful, but-decided and proud letter, directed the epistle to- "Miss Julia Witherson, "(Care of   Russel, Esq.,) "New York City, N. Y.," and sent it to its destination. And all this before saying a word to her son, Charles, on the matter.   ERING, -YET NOBLE,         327 With respect to the second discovery in regalrd to Julia, com- municated to her by Howard (her scheme of womanly redemp- tion), Mrs. Sincgerly thought, as most oir thodox, steady-going peo- ple would think, lthat t was very wild, strange, delicate, doubt- ful, dangerous. But, on the other hand, it was just what one would expect from  the bold, original woman who had con- fessed her errors, as Julia had confessed them. And it was undeniably a noble, holy, and most virtuous undertaking, prov- ing that she who had undertaken it was a woman of a high stamp of soul. All the prejudice in the world could not hinder Mrs. Singerly from acknowledgrin(g this mntch, at least. When she next visited her son, Mrs. Singerly told- him of the letter which she had just sent to Miss Witherson in regard to the money. Now we, all of us, know that Charles was not mercenary; we know that he would not willingoly receive a pecuniary favor from any one; and yet we must confess that lie seemed disap- pointed, or vexed, when his mother told him of this letter and its contents. But, perhaps, it Bas because he deprecated the cold, formal wording of the epistle, or because he knew what pain their refusal to accept her generous gift would cause to Julia. But when he alluded to Julia's glorious career as the reformer of her sex, and when his mother seemed desirous to subdue or moderate his admiration, he, Charles, could restrain himself no longer. "Mother," he cried, "mother, I tell you God never gave a greater soul to any woman than that which animates Julia. So loving, so patient, so bold, so generous, and so pure. Aye, pure. I say the word, mother I, who ktnow all. Has she not repented? Has she not atoned? Is not her virtue at least as free from stain as my own? Is she not, at the lowest rate, equal in chastity to the major part of women? If she has fallen lower, has she not also risen higher? Is she not far more chaste in soul than the most of her sex, or of mine? If she had been a man, and had sinned, and repented, and atoned, as she has done, would she not have been for- /       328         ERRING, YET NOBLE. given? Should she not be more -readily pardoned then, as she is but a woman? Is she not pure in the sight of God? She loves me -yVou know how truly. I love her-you know how fondly. I tell you, mother, that neither of us can live much longer apart from the other? Is she not as worthy to be my wilhe as I am to be her husband? Ah! mother mine, ask your heart these questions, not your head! We have been patient; does .not our patience claim its due reward? We have waited long, oh I how long, for your blessing-is iit not coming at the last? I)Do not'mistake prejudice for principle! She has erred, humanly; but she has atoned divitely. Ah I my mother, if God were to' judge me as harshy as thou judgest my Julia, where, O where would be thy Charles? She is pure, and I am passionate ; we love truly, and our true love must conquer at the last. Wilt thou not bless us in it, oh, my mother?" It is night. And the silence of that period has fallen upon earth. The sky is clouded, though a star here and there peers through the mantle of the dark, and the light of the moon is veiled. And in the quiet Virginia farm-house, in her unadorned, yet comfortable chamber sits M!rs. Singerly, in thought. But her thoughts are not of a pleasant cast, or, at least, they agitate her greatly. See I she rises, and moves to and fro uneasily. She goes to the window and looks out upon the night; but the movement is merely mechanical. Her mind does not direct her bodily motions, but is intent upon some troublous. subject. On a rude bureau by the window is placed a lighted candle, which burns not steadily, but by fits and starts, as though it, too, were thinking upon troublous matters. Ever and anon a gust of wind from the casement bids fair to extinguish it, but the gust passes by and still the candle burns. The night is warm-quite sultry. Perhaps there will be a storm before morning. But whether there will be a tempest to-night or no, we know not  But we are certain of one thing, which is, that a fierce   ERRING YET NOBLE.        329 battle is raging at this very moment (not upon the Potomac or   1 the Mississippi, not a battle where human blood flows like water, and brother meets and murders brother), but a battle of the     soul, where feeling, and principle, and truth war with education, I and prejudice, and habit, which is "second nature."        J Yes; this plain bed-room in a plain farm-house, on this dark-  ly-quiet summer's night, is the scene of a great and momentous   i battle, and the soul of Mrs. Singerly is the battle-ground.    j No banners, no trumpets, no staff-officers-and yet a general   I engagement. Mrs. Singerly's soul is in doubt and sore perplexity. The words of her son, Charles, those words which we have just re- corded, are in her memory, and will not leave it. And her thoughts will dwell upon these words. Love for her son and her son's happiness, gratitude to and admiration of Julia Witherson, a certain natural generosity, the love of truth and of nobilit4y of soul, on the one hand; early education, long,-cherished prejudices, a certain degree of obsti- nacy, an utter hatred of vice and those stained with it, and a certain acquired orthodoxy, on the other ; these, and more than these, contend for mastery within her. While the heavens grow darker, and the air denser, and the stars more scarce; while the little taper burns fitfully upon the ! bureau by the window; while Mrs. Singerly stirs uneasily in    \ her room, let us strive to analyze the struggle in her soul. She thinks of what Julia Witherson (the woman who loves her son, the Iyoman whom her son loves, and whom he wishes to make his wife and her daughter), she thinks of what this creature 1 once was, according to her own showing. An infidel, a holder of false views upon virtue and marriage; aye, a polluted woman. A creature who laughed at the Scriptures, and set up her own vain imaginings, or those of a deceitful philosophy, in the place of the teachings of heaven. A woman who dared shame- lessly to hold a belief that wedlock, that most sacred of institu- tions, was but a pious, time-sanctionedfa'ce. A vile creature, who had lost her persorial purity; a woman whom not all the   oov        ERRING, YET NOBLE. centuries since the flood or all the purgations of earth could restore to the spotless purity which is the crown of woman. Surely it was doubtful whether forgiveness could ever be accorded to such a wretch ; and most surely forgiveness, even if accorded, could never bring oblivion. And such a creature to become her Charles' wife, her daughter! Impossible. The world would cast such a woman as this, when discovered, beyond its pale; and rightly, justly; its safety and respectability demanded it. And suppose that, in the course of time, Julia Witherson's early error was discovered; this might chance-a casual word, after the lapse of years, might do the work; why, then, what a disgraceful doom were hers I The world never for- gives such a sin as this. And a woman thus situated, to become her daughter, and the wife of her son I Impossible. Abomi- nable! Heaven itself, in its infinite mercy, could scarcely for- give such a sinner; how could she, whose powers were but finite, ever go further than heaven itself, and not only forgive, but love, honor, and reward? Beside, could such a woman as this truly repent and truly reform? Could such a reformation and repentance be lasting? Could such a creature make a good wife? a good mothler? The very question seems "most bitterly absurd. Besides, a man married, joined for life, to a woman who has once erred, Vannot be long happy with her. Passion, at first, may reconcile him; but as love fails with years, memory awakes and suspicion begins. Such thoughts as these (and many kindred thoughts in the same strain, which will suggest themselves to our readers, if they will but imagine themselves in Mrs. Singerly's present mental position) rush to her mind, with almost overwhelming force. And heo determination is made. Come what, come may, she will never give her consent to the union of her son Charles to Julia Witherson. The battle has been going on 'fiercely. But the victory seems now to be in favor of the enemy. Early education, the preju- dices of a stern, relentless orthodoxy, and the dictates of worldly knowledge and suspicion, seem to be triumphant.   JRRING, YET NOBLE. '61  Come, Julia! come, Charles.! bury your dead-your killed  hope-slain trust; bury these. The conflict is over. And the Providence of'Fate and the artillery of Argument have decided  against you. Yes, the battle is over, the victory is won, and that unseen battle-field, the soul of Charles' mother, is comparatively quiet.  And Mrs. Singerly goes to the window and looks out on the  night. It is her custom so to do immediately before retiring, and she intends to retire shortly. She looks out. The heavens     i are darker than they were a half an hour ago ; the stars have    i disappeared; all is dark, as is the lonely fate of Charles and  Julia. And a sudden gust of wind, more violent than usual, blows out with a whiff the little taper upon the bureau, and all  within and without is utter darkness. Typical, sadly typical, of  your lot, ye hapless, ever-to-be-severed lovers, who must ever    ! love, yet ever love in vain.                      Mrs, Singerly closes the window and re-lights the taper, and  is about to retire, when suddenly the passionate words of her  son Charles rush to her memory with redoubled force. "God never gave a greater soul to any woman than that which ani- mates Julia Witherson." "If she ias fallen lower, has she not also risen higher?" "If she had been a man, would she not save been forgiven?" "Is she not pure in the sight of God?" ' I tell you that neither of us can live much longer apart from the other." "Do not mistake prejudice for principle. She has  erred humanly, but she has atoned divinely. Oh, if God were     I but to judge us as harshy as thou judgest Julia." "We love truly, and our true love must conquer at the last." She remem- bered these words most vividly, and a sudden, irresistible instinct told her that these passionate words were, simply truth.  The battle has recommenced with more fierceness than ever.  Ah, Charles! ah, Julia! Do not bury your dead yet. Hope, the victory may yet be yours and Love's I The taper burns brightly, especially in contrast to, the thick, surrounding darkness. And a peal of thunder is heard in the  distance. The storm is coming up. But Mrs. Singerly heeds   332       RRINGo, YET NOBLE. neither taper or tempest. She is intent upon the thoughts that will force a passage into the depths of her soul. She thinks aloud. "I know that she, that Julia, whatever were her former doubts as to religion, is now a true and practical Christian. So the Rev. George Howard has often assured me ; and others also. I know, also, that her views of marriage and of chastity have altogether changed, and that her present sentiments on these points are most correct and womanly; and that she has truly repented of her early error I cannot if I would deny. She has shown it in a hundred ways, and I know she has felt it even more than she has shown it. Her noble, candid conduct to Charles ; her even yet more noble and open course towards myself, cannot be too highly praised, or sufficiently wondered at for their originality of honor. How respectful she has ever been to me I how finely she refused to take advantage of Charles' affection to lead# him to disobedience of my wishes I He would have married her had she given him encouragement. But no; she would not receive the son without'the blessing of the mother. True pride that I Noble girl I And then to think of her expiation and atonement I It sounds like a wild romance this story of her wanderings amongst those horrible creatures. It was a dangerous, a delicate undertaking ; with almost any other woman it would have been -indelicate and of most doubtful tendency; but she, strange being, brought good out of evil. Truly, if she has fallen lower than her sex, she has also risen above it. How talented she is, too, and beautiful; not with the common cast of material beauty, but with the charms, of soul upon her face and figure--a woman fitted physically and mentally to adorn any station ; may I not say morally also? at least as regards the present and the future, if not, alas I the past. And how truly she loves my son, loves him as he deserves to be loved; and how he loves and almost worships her! Their separation seems to have rendered them but more fond. But it tells upon Charles' spirits, and on his health I   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        333 fear; and they have been so patient, so uncomplaining, and     she has been so generous, so magnificently liberal, sending  my boy one half of all she'had in the world; and so modest, too, with all her good works and generosity; so desirous of concealment. They will never cease to love. If such sin as hers can be repented of, can be atoned fo;  can be wiped out, then by patience, sorrow, good works candor, generosity, purity of life, soundness of views, true religion, and originality of honor and fervor of love, has she repented, atoned, and blotted out her youthful transgression.  I But can such a sin be truly atoned for on this earth? That is the question. The world says no. Reason says no. My early education tells me no. But my heart says yes! Which is in the right? My worldly head or my woman's heart? May not the world be mistaken -on this matter as it is on others? May not Julia Witherson, after all, having learn'ed  the horrors of sin by awfuexperience, make a most excellent  ! wife and mother? May not Charles-and she be happy yet,      i and may not I be blessed in their happiness? Had she been     a man, as Charles remarked, and sinned and atoned as she has done, would she not have been forgiven? Must she lose all hope because she is a womtan? Is there a sex in sin?    ; But yet our sex have greater responsibilities than men, and a more strict account is justly required of them. Is her sin pardonable? Can she, ought she to be treated as a virtuous   ! woman when she has been so vile?"               ! And so the mother of Charles thought on for many, many     i minutes. Numerous other details and points of the subject, pro and con, presented themselves to her mind, as they will suggest themselves to the reader, but we will not write them here;.                            ;  Love for Charles; a desire for his happiness; doubts  -  whether this happiness would be really secured or not by     i his union to Julia; gratitude and admiration of Miss Wither- son, combined with horror at her former life; the promptings of a naturally noble mind, and- a generous heart struggling    834        ERRING, YET NOBLE. with the suggestions of prudence, suspicion, early prejudice of education, and the dictates of a rigid conventional ortho- doxy; these principles waged desperate war within the soul of Mrs. Singerly. The battle is fiercely contested. The arguments on either side fight their ground inch by inch. Now one side gains a temporary adyantage, now the other. There are no battles like the battles of thie soul! Gods I what results are hanging upon this contest I The fate of two'lives; the happiness of two hearts; the success or failure of true patience and true repentance I Charles at this moment is sleeping', and his rest is delight- ful. He smiles, and utters brokenly in his slumbers, excla- mations of happiness, for he dreams of Julia. And Julia, at this molient, is kneeling at her bedside pray- ing for the happiness of her lover, and for her union with him. ' Oh, God," she crie's, "Thou who art love, grant that love may be triumphant 1" And while Charles sleeps and Julia prays, their fate is being decided in this quiet farm-house in Virginia, in this little plainly-furnished room, on the battle-field of a mother's soul I The taper is burning steadily upon the bureau ; it sheds now, since the casement has been closed, a mild, steady, pleasant light. Its constant flame contrasts strongly with the darkness without. Though occasionally a flash of lightning. darts across the heavens, succeeded by the booming thunder--the storm has not yet come, but it is coming. And still the battle rages ; and still it is undecided. Mrs.* Singerly's face and frame partake of the -agitation of her soul. She moves to and fro uneasily. Suddenly, her eye falls upon a book which is lying on the bu- reau. It is her Bible, a rather large, well-bound volume. And as suddenly a strange thought strikes her. Strange, absurd, perhaps our readers"miny designate it, but yet similar ideas have   EBBRRING YEr NOBLE.        335 often occurred to the human mind, which is by nature supersti. tious, and have been acted upon. This strange thoughllt is simply this: The arguments, pro and con, in relation to her extending her favor to Julia Witherson, and giving consent to her marriage with her son, are so evenly balanced that she cannot decide for herself. So she determines that the Bible shall decide for her. She will open the holy book at random, and be gaided by the texts upon which her glances happen to fall, and their applica- tion to the matter in hand. By this means, as it were, heaven itself shall decide for her. Now this may seem very strange to the reader.  He or she may cry "Impossible."   But we assure you that instances of this kind have been recorded in history, and that we know  of some exatmples in our own sphere of observation. At any rate, the idea occurred to Mrs. Singerly in a moment of great excitement, and, without debating its merits, she excited- ly accepted it. She goes to the bureau, takes from it the Bible, and opens it. This is now the crisis of the battle. The contending hosts, within her soul, breathless, await the issue! The storm has-come outside.  The rain is commencing to fall, and the thunder and lightuing are incessant. But the flame of the taper pours a steady light upon the face of Mrs. Singerly, as she stands between the bureau and the win- dow, with the Bible in her hands. Her petite, ladylike figure is   I bent over the book, and her expressive, though somewhat care- worn face is fixed intently upon it. Charles is still dreaming of Julia-and Julia has fallen asleep .  1 to dream of Charles. Mrs. Singerly (raising her eyes upward with a prayer for that Divine blessing in which she devoutly, though somewhat supersti- tiously, believes) opens the Bible, and her glance falls upon the words of the Saviour to the woman of sin : "Neither do I con-  demn thee; go and sin no more."  She closes the book, and then opens it once more at random; and this time her eye sees the simple, memorable sentence of !   336   .     ERRING, YET NOBLE. Him who "spake as never man spake ": "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven her ; for she loved much." The application of these two passages wras evident. Mrm Singerly understood it at once, and yielded. And the battle wad over. Love, and Repentance, and Generosity, and Atonement were triumphant; and Prejudice, and bigoted Orthodoxy, and Obsti- nacy departed. It storms still. But what of that! The conflict of the- ele- ments may continue ; but the conflict of the soul is over. Mrs. -Singcerly reverently lays down the Bible, and retires for the night; and then extinguishes the taper; and only the glare of the lightning occasionally and fitfully illumines the apartment. But Mrs. Singerly smiles to think how happy she will cause her Chailes to be to-morrow, and what bliss she will bestow on Julia, and how they both will bless her. And with this smile upon her face, she falls asleep. Julia Witherson is pure in God's sight. But she cannot be more pure than thee, thou holy, loving mother of our hero. With all thy innocent bigotry, thou art a glorious woman. And may the Judge of all flesh be as merciful to thee as thou hast this night resolved to be to her, our heroine, so " erring," yet so "noble "I!  i      '      -     .       .

The sky is as Ilear as though it had never known a cloud. The thunder and ightning are succeeded by sweet sounds and sunlight, And harles Singerly awakes from his sleep and his dreams of Julia. He feels better this morning than he has felt for weeks, both n body and in mind. He hopes-yes, absolutely. And his iope makes him strong. When his mother enters his apartment to pay him her usual lorning visit, he receives her warmly, with a kiss, with a smile, nd with a blessing. And his mother smiles upon him, kisses and blesses him in eturn. "H ow did you rest last night, my child?" she asks,  "Oh, capitally. And I had such delightful dreams, mother." "Did not the storm disturb you?"  "It awoke me, mother. But I went to sleep and dreamt gain*." "And of what or of whom did you dream, my son?"  "Of her, mother-of her!" "It is of her that I would now take this opportunity to speak,  ly boy.  Listen to me, Charles." ,  "On this subject, mother, I would listen to you forever." "Pardon me if part of what I say sounds harsh. But, Charles, ou know what SHE   once was-irreligious, radical, impure in iought and deed." "Oh, my mother, why will you recall so bitterly the wretched  ast?"  ,                         , 15   'S8    ERRING, YET NOBLE. "Simply, that while it is yet fresh in your recollection, you may give me a solemn answer to a solemn qnestion." ; "And this question is "- "Do you honor and respect her? Can you honor and respect her as a man should honor and respect his wife? Is her past so blotted out by her noble repentance, and atonement, and true love that you will no more remember it against her? - With the knowledge of her past sins, can you love and honor her as 'though she had not sinned at all? I have asked you this ques- tion before ; but I now ask it with a purpose, solemnly, -and for the last time."  "And solemnly, as in the sight of heaven, I answer yes, dear mother. Yes, I honor and love her even more than if she had not- sinned, so sincere has been her repentance, so wonderfully glorious her atonement. Her present is spotless ; her future will be stainless." "Do you love her, love her as a man should love a woman, with all your heart and mind, and soul, and strength? I ask this question, also solemnly, with a purpose, and for the last time.," "And again I answer, as in thesight of heaven, yes. I love her as my father loved you, dear mother.. I love her as I love yourself-with a different but as great a love. She is your only rival in my heart. I love her; I ever have loved her since the moment I met her ; I love her for her beauty, her mind, her heart, her soul; , love her for her truth, her candor, her gene- rosity, her nobility, her pride, her honor ; I love her because she so loves me." -;  "You love her truly now.   Will your affection last, my son?"  "Ah, mother, you asked that question unawares. How can love be true unless i be lasting? Mother, do you think I shall ever cease to love you?" "No, my son." " Neither shall I. ever cease to love her. Though I live until the day of judgment, still should I love her. You may see best   ERRIN , YET NOBLE.       339 to forbid, and thereby prevent our union. We do not blame you, mother. We do but grieve. But whether united or not, we do and ever must love." "You would be happy if she were your wife?" "Oh, this is cluel, mother. To ask me if I would be happy with the woman whom you forbid me to marry I Oh, God 1 would I not be blessed with her?- Heaven itself could have no greater bliss to offer than to be evermore with God and Julia." "And you think she loves you?" "Think she loves me I How strangely you talk, dear mother. What is the matter with you this morning? Thilk--mother, do you merely think that the sun is shining? Do you merely think that the birds are singing? Do you merely think I love you? If so, then do I only think that Julia Witherson loves me. Mother, she has proved her love for me unmistakably in many ways, and you know it. But for what do you ask me such questions as these this morning-questions to which you know there can be but one answer -Why do you ask them so earnestly? "I have a reason, which you will know shortly." "A reason-know shortly-can it be that you have re--oh, God, can it be that?" "But think, Charles--were I to withdraw my refusal to your marriage?"  "Withdraw your refusal-oh, mother!" "Could you take her to your arms, knowing that before she saw you, she had yielded? Could you call her joyfully at the altar, 'wife,' knowing at the time that her betrayer lived, aye, might be within hearing, of your nuptial benediction?"  "' Why torture me-thus, mother? Oh, horrible, horrible!" "But, alas I is it not true, my son? Can your love endure even such a test as this?1" "Aye, mother," cried Charles, after a brief but severe mental struggle-daguerreotyped on his expressive face. J love her not for what she has been, but for what she is, and for what she will be. I, too, have sinned-she will have to forgive me, as I   '340        ERRING, YET NOBLE. do her. And so generous, so liberal, so gloriously self-sacrificing has she been I Do you forget, mother, that she offered unto us one-half of her fortune when she heard of our affliction? Do you forget that she has always loved and honored you?" "No, my son, I do not forget all this. You believe, then, Charles, that she is a good and pure woman?" "As I believe that God is just, I do." "You believe that you will be unhappy without her, most happy with her?.'              ' "As I believe that sunlight makes summer, I do." "You think that she will 'make you a true wife, and be a faithful mother to your children?" "I know it, mother. But why, oh, why these questions? why thus put me through the catechism of my heart?" "You wish to know why I ask you these questions?' "Yes, dear mother yes-why inquire of me so closely in regard to my feelings towards one from whom you have banished' me forever?"           - "Perhaps this banishment is only temporary, Charles." "Only temporary I Did you say, ' temporary,' mother?" And Charles' voice had a thrill in it, as though he were a criminal under sentence of death, asking if he were indeed for- given. ^ Yes, my son ; that was the very word It used," replied Mrs. Singerly, with a smile. "i Ah, you smile. Oh, God I mother, a. glorious idea occurs to me, which makes the blood all rush to my heart in ecstacy. You wRl not banish us forever. You will not always separate us. You will forgive her. She will become your daughter. God bless you, mother." And Charles, who had been lying upon the settee, now started up and embraced, in strong emotion, his mother, who was seated by his side. "Nay, my son, moderate your transports, and listen to me, calmly." "Oh, mother, how can I be calm on such a subject?"   ERRING, YET NOB LE.        341 "Well, at any rate, lie down again on your settee. Lie down, or else you will be sick again, and I will not speak a word fur- ther to you on this matter." "I am still as death," cried Charles, evidently as restless as he well could be, though he "went through the .motion " of lying down again on the settee. "You may have thought me stern, harsh, unforgiving, thus far, Charles," continued his mother. Here, she was interrupted by her son, who again rose and again embraced her, as he emphatically protested against the ideqf that he had ever deemed his mother to be anything of the' sort she had just mentioned. When this diversion was over, Mrs. Singerly resumed as follows: "But I have been actuated in all that I have done, in every act of my life, by two motives-the desire to do right, and the wish to contribute to what I honestly considered your real hap- piness. Do you believe this, Charles?" "No, I do not believe it," was the unexpected reply. "What, Charles i" cried Mrs. Singerly, in the utmost aston- ishment. "No, I do not believe it, mother, for I do more, much more- I know it-I will take my oath to it." "Ah, I knew you did but jest; but be serious for a moment, darling." "Oh, I feel too happy to be serious, mother ; I hope, and hope is paradise." "Descend to earth awhile and listen to me as I briefly state to you, my history, as it were-the history'of my change of views on several important matters since I first met her." "Eer who is to be my wife, your daughter, is it not so?" "It may be so, Charles." "Ah, I feel sure of it now. Oh, heavens I I am just begin- ning to live.' "When I was young, Charles," said Mrs. Singerly, "I was taught to look upon what is called ' dissipation 'in men as an unpardonable offence. As to the slightest breach of even exter- /-    42        ERRiTNG, YET NOBLE. nal decorum in women, I learned to look upon it with horror. And as to positive error in a female, that was something so abominable, that I was taught to rank it. with murder and atheism. I married your father chiefly because he had never been 'wild,' and was, therefore, in my eyes, the model of a man. As you grew up, I saw with sorrow your tendency to dis- sipation ; but as I knew your noble nature, I waas forced to con- fess, from your example, that ' dissipation' was not the unpar- donable offence I deemed it, since; as in your case, it was asso- ciated with many noble qualities. My views, therefore, on this subject, were modified ; they changed and became more liberal, and I think mote just. But still my unvarying detestation and horror of female license remained -unchaiged. I was right on this point, but as I have since learned, I carried my righteousness too far. Impurity is a sin, and a great one; but like all other sins, it may be forsaken, repented of and atoned for. And as God forgives all transgressions which are truly repented of, so should mnan and woman forgive. These truths I have learned lately; spite of the prejudices, I may-say bigotry, of my early education, I have learned these truths well. And she has been my teacher.  She, with her truthfulness, her noble, most original candor, her true pride, her generosity, her love, her true repentance, her religious conversion, her magnificent atone- ment, proves her sorrow for her error, and demands man's for- giveness of it. She, in short, is 'erring, yet noble.'" "Erring, yet noble," repeated Charles. "Dear mother, you have learned to- know her at the last, to comprehend her and to do her justice. Kiss me, my mother," and the pair embraced. And still Charles kept repeating, as though there were some magic in them, the words, the three words, "Erring, yet noble." Sud- dinly he started up and cried, "And now, mother, as you have discovered what she is, what is to be the result of your discovery?" "Your happiness, my son," replied his mother. "I consent to your union with her, whom now we name for the first time during our present conversation-with Julia Witherson. She shall be your wife. She shall be my daughter." /   {   "God in heaven bless you, oh, my mother I I am too happy to say more." And with these simple words, uttered in a tone of indes- cribable bliss and "tenderness, Charles wound his arms around lis mother, and kissed her repeatedly; and each 4kiss spoke elo- quently of his love, his gratitude, and his ecstacy. His heart was on his lips. Throughout the wide, wide world, from India to the Pole, there lived no happier man than he. She was vin- dicated; the woman he loved had justice done her at the last by the one of her own sex he prized most; the woman he loved was to be his forever, his honored wife. He had waited, he had been obedient and patient, and now his reward was come in his mother's blessing. It had stormed the night before, but the day was now clear. So his tempest of the heart was over, and his sky of hope was now unclouded. The birds sang gaily. But the music in his heart was sweeter than the songs of all the warblers in creation. Hie reclined on the settee by the open window, with the sun- light smiling o'er him, theglorious prospect opening to his sight, the balmy breeze laughing lightly about him ; with lis arms around his mother, unutterably happy. His friend Howard entered, and Charles cried joyously: "George, my mother has given me paradise for life-she has withdrawn her refusal. Julia and I are to be man and wife; we are both to be her children, and your parishioners. And you shall be the priest at a certain wedding that I know of. Here, George, come and thank my mother, in my name, yours, Julia's, and her own, for making us all four so happy. And I  am well now and strong, and rich, and great in my happiness, and am in love with the whole world. God bless you I oh, God bless you, oh, my mother 1"  Ie                        iI   344        ERRING, YET NOBE. C HAPTER      VIII. HEAVINESS MAY ENDURE FOR A NIGHT, BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING. "ET us leave Virginia for a while, and betake ourselves to the good city of the Knickerbockers. Julia Witherson is seated in her luxurious]ly-furrished room, in her unele's house. It is the same room in which, years ago, we saw her one cold, dismal evening in the month of March, musing sadly over her then recent separation from Charles. The appearance of the apartment has been much improved since that time; entirely new and very costly furniture has been added to its attractions, and the old book-case has been replaced by a very elaborately-carved affair of the most modern style, filled with the choicest books. Several new and elegant paintings grace the walls, and altogether the room has a most charming appearance. Prominent on the table, in the centre of the room, near which table Julia is seated, is a handsomely-bound volume of Charles Singerly's poems. And near the book is a-daguer- reotype, at which our heroine is at this moment intently gaz- ing. Need we say it is the miniature of Charles? Our heroine is sad to-day, sad as she was that eve in March to which we have just alluded, and Ifrom the very same cause, her separation from the man she loves. It is true that it is a very dismal morning. It has been raining incessantly since an early houiir, and the constant patter of thp rain is very dreary. But it is not the weather that has affected our heroine's spirits, it is her own wretch- edness.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        345 And- yet she looks most beautiful to-day. ^ Pale, yet charm- ing; sad, yet most captivating. Her rich, dark, glorious hair floats with a car"eless abandon over her shoulders; her proud form is bowed gracefully over the miniature of her lover ; her dark eyes beam tenderly as they almost devour, with fondness, the painted features of the man she worships, and her face is full of soul. There are the elements of strong contrasts about this sketch-the splendor within ; the dreariness without; the beauty, the sumptuous elegance, and the sorrow. The morning hours rolled on. For a while Julia gazed at the portrait of her lover; then with a sigh she turned to her usual wild, abstract studies, to which she devoted a portion of her every day. She tried to banish all human feeling in the mazes of scholastic abstraction; but in vain ; the image of her lover seems stamped upon every page. She then called in Mary Barton, pretty, curly-haired and amiable. With her Julia conversed on various matters. appertaining to the household, for, spite of her studies, our heroine was a capital and efficient " house-keeper." She also commissioned her attendant with various errands and messages to several of those women whom she herself had, at various times, rescued from vice and infamy. For our heroine did no6t content herself with merely saving-women; she kept them saved. She watched over them during their reformatory career, and gave them both material and spiri- tual aid and comfort; nor did she allow her personal sorrow    3 to interfere with this work. And so Mary Barton was, this morning, charged with various commissions of mercy, which were to be attended to at once, despite the weather. And     I Mary gladly obeyed; first, because she loved her work;      E secondly, because she so dearly loved and so truly honored Julia, her own preserver. Our heroine also conversed with Mary concerning various schemes of charity, to the practical exemplification of which' she was devoting much time, energy and money. Besides       i   346       ERRING, YET NOBLE. 'Wholly supporting many worthy, but poor and infirm men and women, Julia was interested in various benevolent asso- ciations, and was constantly doing good. She felt responsi- ble to man and to God for the right use of her great-wealth, and she endeavored faithfully to make it the agency of bless- ing to all around, and especially to those peculiar friends of heaven, the despised of earth, the poor and the needy ; and, therefore, we think that our heroine's natural extravagrance, her love for elegance and comfort, etc., was perfectly excu- sable. If she was liberal to others, certainly she had a right to be liberal to herself. And we may here remark that, thoughl we have had no opportunity of beholding our heroine in what is called " do- mestic life," her home-virtues were numerous. She was not one of those beings whose good traits are never to be seen in their' own houses, but one of the diametrically opposite sort. Her relations with her aunt, uncle, niece and nephew, with whom she lived, her conduct to her servants, was of the most exemplary disposition. She was tenderly beloved by all who knew her intimately. They might think her some- what strange, but they knew her to bejoving, and true ; and when your intimates have this opinion of you, reader, rejoice and be exceeding glad. She lad been a faithful daughlter; she was now a dutiful niece, an amiable relative, a true, warm-hearted friend, a noble, truth-loving, truth-telling, generous woman. After Mary Barton's departure Julia endeavored to resume her studies, but in vain, she could not concentrate her mind upon them., She then left the room, and, entering the parlor, opening her favorite piano, played upon it sweetly, plaintively, divinely. Oh! if the ghost of old Shiner could but have heard her I But, suddenly, in the midst of a most delicious passage, she remembered that her aunt had complained this morning of a slight headache, and upon the instant our hero- ine ceased her melody, though she was now interested in it, lest the noise should, in any way, disturb her -aunt. This   ERRINGO, YET NOBLE.        347  was a slight incident, but it showed character, self-command,   $ and true kindness of heart, even in little things!  Next door to Julia's home there lived a very brilliant and  fashionable young lady, who was, at the present moment, wishing for a companion of her own age to pass awayv with her the rainy hours. Miss Witherson might have paid a visit this morning to her neighbor, who was intimate with theI family, and been entertained with scandal, but our heroine relished not this kind of entertainment. She was tho fond of truth to love gossip; she was too kind-hearted to hear  scandal, and too proud to debase herself by uttering it; consequently our heroine was not very popular in general  "society," so called; she was also averse to it; she had  been gay once, but for years had lived a retired life. Be- sides, as our heroine was veryproud, she regarded herself, and justly, as'the superior in mind and soul of the majority    i of "women of fashion," and she did not, as a rule, associate  n i with her inferiors ; so she did not to-day call upon her neigh. - I bor, but, closing the piano, returned to her room. Oh!. how  dismally it was raining I The patter of thei drops upon the roofs was ceaseless--and so dreary. It was not a thunder-shower, but a continuous storm unrelieved by any ex- citement. It was dark, too; quite dark.  Few persons could    I be seen in the streets, all animals had taken shelter, out-door business was suspended ; and, seated by the table in the centre   1 of the apartment, Julia thinks in sorrow upon her love.  She takes a letter from her pocket, and re-reads it for the  1i twentieth time. ' It is the letter Mrs. Singerly wrote to her, refus- i  img her generous offer of one hundred thousand dollars to herself and son, though at the same time thanking her for it in most - grateful terms. Still it is a formal letter ; Julia reads in every  line of it -that the writer's prejudices have not yet been conquer-  ed ;.,that she still looks upon the one to whom it is addressed as  unworthy to become the wife of her sou,n Yes, Julia feels that Charles' mother is still an obstacle to their union, which she fears can never be removed.                    i ' '\       ii   348       . ERRING, YET NOBLE. And so she must live a lonely life, and die, at last, a lonely death. God help her! She can never know the luxury of being a loved and honored wife ;.she can never call a man by the name of " husband." Nlo children shall " rise and call her blessed." None of the sweet, domestic heart-ties of a. home of her own can ever be felt byv her. She must love-still love and keep on loving-but never reach fruition. Otlers-who love, withl not half her purity or fervor, will wed and be happy ; she must wit- ness their bliss, but never share it. Her vivid fancy pictures tile joys of married life, the ecstacy of love, the sweets of tender smiles and kisses. And then her fancy paints the dark, dreary loneliness of unwedded life, no kisses, no smiles, no husband, no children-one dull routine of duty-plenty of work for the body, much occupation for the soul, but nothing, nothing, nothing for the heart. The first imight have been, but cannot be; the last should not have been, but is to be. "And yet," cried she, in her sorrow, as though she were ad- dressing sAoe unseen judge, "I do not merit such a gloomy fate as this. True, I have sinned " (and she shuddered as she remem- bered how she had sinned),- but I was very young, and he who tempted me was very cunning. I have repented, heaven knows, in dust and ashes, and for many years, for this, my early error. I have led, since then, a life as pure and spotless in thought, word and deed, as the most virtuous of my sex. I have atoned, as. few sinners have ever atoned upon this earth. I have loved, as few women have ever loved. Am I never to be forgiven? Is my sin ever to be remembered against me? Cannot a present and a future redeem a past? It is cruel. It is unjust. I have not deserved my fate." And as she spoke these words, she rose to her feet; her mag- nificent form surpassed itself in graceful pride. Her large, dark eye fashed at the injustice of her sentence; she threw her head back, with its wealth of dark hair, and arched her superb neck ; while her intellectual, expressive face seemed to look defiance to fate. But her mood soon changed. She took the true view of her position. ,    ERRING, YET NOBLE.       349 "God forgive me, for nmy proud qnd foolish -words," she cried, e throwing"herself passionately upon her knees beside the table. "I have deserved and more than deserved, all the punishment I have borne and still must bear. Or if I have merited aught of reward, I have sufficiently received it in the approval of my'con- science and the pardon of my God. Yes, thou Holy One, who hearest me, I feel that Thou hast pardoned me, all unworthy as I am. Thou wilt open Thy heaven for me, sinner as I have been; it is but just, then, I should endure my sorrow on the ealrth." And in penitence, not pride, Julia bowed her head and heart before the Almighty One, in whom she believed. "And yet it is very hard to bear, this cross of mine, my Father," she murmured. "To live, to love, to be' beloved, and yet to have no joy of either life or love. Never to be his; to see him, to hear of him, to be near him, and yet to be as far removed as earth from heaven! Ever to hope, yet never to be blest! To strive to be worthy of him, yet never to be wilh him. To live together in heart, yet apart in body. To long-to feel his lips pressed to mine ; to yearn to hear him cry; 'My Julia, my wife 1' and yet never to be his wife, his Julia 1 Oh, it is very, very hard, is it not, my God? I know I have de- served it all; but yet, oh Merciful One, have mercy upon me. Take me from this earth of sorrow. Take me to Tlhy heaven of bliss. Oh, let me die. In heaven no fate and no mothers can part us. Let me die, my Father!" And with "a broken and a contrite heart," she looked through her streaming eyes upwards. 'Never, in all her life be- fore, had she felt so utterly lonely, so utterly hopeless, so utterly wretched as now. Never before had she suffered as she suffered at this hour. Truly the retribution of her sin was fully come. Her early error was expiated now if never before. This was her time of agony, her dark hour. It is only in such seasons as this that the human soul can form an idea of the Sacred Agonies of the Garden of Gethsemane! And still it rained on-and still the day was dismal-and the                       +   350        ERRING, YET NOBLE. dreary patter of the rain-drops ceased not. And in her splen- didly furnished room, with all the appliances of luxury ald intel- lect around her, with her. costly robe around her magnificent form, and ler face beautiful as that of Guido's Magdalenle, Julia knelt in her great sorrow. And her eyes fall upon her lover's poems and her lover's portrait, lying on the table beside her, and she kisses them passionately.  When Charles learned from his mother's lips that she, at last, consented to his union with Julia, his first impulse was to write immediately to the woman of his heart a passionate epistle, explaining all that had occurred, and beggin(r her, spite of etiquette, or aught else in the world, to come to him at once. But hearing that Julia's relative, the woman who rented from our heroine the farm-house in whic he had, for so malny weeks, been confined, was about to write to Julia urging her presence on pecuniary matters, lie abandoned this idea, intending to surprise Julia with ler joy upon her arrival; thus turning a visit of business into a visit of bliss. This being prem-cised, let us rtclurn to Julia. A day or two after tthe rainy morning, whose sorrows we have above described, our heroine, who was still melancholy, not yet recovered from her depression, received a -note from her Virginia relative requesting her immediate presence on an important matter. She glanced eagerly over the epistle to see if there was any mention made of him, the man she loved; but not one word did it contain on this subject, it was .merely a dry business letter; and feeling very unlike business in her present condition, our heroine threw down the missive with a sigh. "I will not go," she thought. 'Why sthould I? It will be- so painful to meet himr again, and then to part. Why harrow his soul and mine by another fruitless interview? Whlly merely see and hear him for a moment? or, worse, be near him and yet wot see or hear lhim. And his motlher, I will not encounter her again. My agent f   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        351 will attend to all pecuniary matters better than I can myself. I will remain." And then, having determined that it was best, on all ac- counts, both for herself and her lover, that she should not go, woman-like she straightway took a whim into her head that go she zwould. And she went. *     *    *   8   *   *^  *  Julia arrived at the Virginia farm-house, attended, to the matter of business on which she had been summoned, and received a message that Mrs. Singerly requested :the honor of an interview with her in hler son's apartment. Wondering what the meaning of this message might be, she obeyed the summons, and entered the room designated. It was very plainly furnished, thus presenting a great con- trast to the luxurious apartment in which we saw Julia upon a rainy morning not long ago. The day itself was a perfect contrast to the dreary day of storm to which we have just alluded. Instead of the patter of rain-drops, was to be heard through the open window the songs of the birds ; instead of a sky of clouds, there was to be seen a blue heaven of briglit sunshine. But Julia Witherson was just as beautiful, and almost as sad now in the midst of the sunlight as she was then in'the midst of the storm. Before her reclined on .the settee the man she loved--Charles Singerly, the poet.; Captain Singerly, the patriot. There he is, the man of her heart, with his classic face (which to-day seems strangely happy, though, as it were, with a concealed happiness), and his fine eye (which looks upon her now with such a singular expression), and his exquisite mouth (over which flits a smile), wlile his elegant form is attired as though for a holiday. "Can he be happy?" she asks her heart. "Can he be happy, when" we are parted and I am, wretched?" But, whether he be happy or no, there he is, not many feet from her, yet removed out of reach as truly as though he were in the wild, strange, far-off country of Japan. Near her son stands Mrs. Singerly (who has risen to receive   352        ERRING, YET NOBLE. her), the petite, lady-like, reserved-looking mother of her lover, the mother who loves her not, and who has parted her from her love forever. Mrs. Singerly seems somewhat agitated at our heroine's entrance, but soon recovers her usual polite formality of manner. As for Julia, she patiently waits what is to be said to her ; but in her own mind she resolves never to rack her heart vainly by meeting Charles again, at any rate-in his mother's presence. "Will you not be seated, Miss Witherson?" said Mrs. Sin- gerly. Prosaic enough, truly. And Julia complies with her request, saying, however, "t Pardon me, madam. But, as I am not well to-day, may I ask, without offence, that our interview be as brief as possible?" And here again she noticed upon the lips of her lover a smile, as though of amusement, at the idea of her wishing the present interview to be a brief one. And she asked herself if there was aught so strange in this desire. Was it likely she could wish it to be a long one? "I have requested the honor of your company, Miss Wither- son, in order that my son, who cannot yet leave- his apartment, and myself might have an opportunity to express to you orally, as well as in writing, our many great obligations to you for your many favors unto us." ":Nay, madam," replied our heroine, "you are mistaken. IJt is 1 who owe you many thanks for putting it into my power to be of any use to you." "Allow me, Miss Witherson, notwithlstanding your polite fiction, to place the matter in its true light. Myself and my son have enjoyed your hospitality for many weeks." "Pardon me, if any thanks are due, render them to my cousin" (the relative who rented the farm-house of our heroine), "not to me-she is properly entitled to them." "I have tendered them in that quarter. I have also tendered a more substantial payment-which, to my great surprise and regret, has been declined." ,n C   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         353 "My cousin, madam, has too much respect for friends of mine, and far too much admiration for the brave soldiers of our re- public, to accept pecuniary reward for doing them a slight ser- vice. No more upon this subject, I beg of you, madam." Our heroine did not state, however (what was the truth), that she had insisted upon her " cousin " receiving a liberal sum from herself in payment of the board, attendance, and etceteras, relating to the residence of fMrs. Singerly and son with her. But Julia was a poor hand at narrating her own good deeds, though we have seen how very candid she has been at different times in refgard to her errors. "But, Miss Witherson," said Mrs. Singerly, " there is one subject on which I rmust speak, whether you prohibit it or not. My ton and myself will- never rest satisfied until we tell -you, personally, face to face, how very deeply, truly grateful we are, and ever will be, for your most liberal, your most wonderfully generous offer of your fortune to my son when affliction befell him. If we did not accept your most noble gift, it was not, we assure you, because we failed to appreciate, in the minutest item, the full claims of your self-denying generosity upon our admira- t fion, and our life-long gratitude." "Madam," cried our heroine, " if I have deserved aught at your hands in return for a-trifling offer of service, you can repay me ten times over by reconsidering your determination and accepting that money-as a loan, if you will. I Or if not, at least, by saying nothing more about it." "But," continued Mrs. Singerly, c"I must protest"-- "And 1, madam," interrupted Julia, " must protest against any further conversation on this subject." "Miss Witherson, allow me to ask you, do you remember one winter's afternoon, some years ago, when yourself, my son and I met, conversed, and parted, as we thought, forever? That afternoon when I learned your history, decided against you, and refused my consent to your union with my son? Do you remember that afternoon?" Mrs. Singerly asked this abrupt question in her usual man-  {  354:        ERRING, YET NOBLE. ner, just as if she was making some customary, everyday inquiry. Julia Witherson rose from her seat, in anger and astonish- ment. This was a questioni indeed, and a most singular and un- necessary one. "She asks, she, his mother, asks me if I remem- ber that night of shame and sorrow! As though I could ever forget it I Wlry does she ask me if I remember it? Why does she ask me this question now? Why does she allude to the subject at all? Professing gratitude to me, and then straight- way insulting me. For insult it is to ask this question under the circumstances. What motive can she have? Before him, too!" Such were our heroine's hasty reflections. And she looked at Charles. He did not seem agitated or annoyed, but happy and smiling--while Mrs. Singerly seemed to be possessed with some fixed purpose which she was determined to fulfill. What could it all mean? Julia gazed, in her agitation, vaguely through the open win- dow. The sun shone brightly on the green fields, the sky was cloudless, the birds sang deliciously. And then in a glass, that hung,^near where she was standing, she caught a glimpse of her own intellectual, though now flushed face. But though she saw all, she noted it not. Anger, pride, wonder, filled her soul-and she answered nothing. "Do you remember that afternoon?" again asked Mrs. Singerly. All Julia's various emotions now concentrated themselves into pride, as she answered haughtily : "Madam, I cannot see wherefore you ask of me, at this time, such a question. The previous tenor of your conversation did not lead me to expect such an uncalled for allusion as is contain- ed in your interrogatory. I decline to converse with you on this subject. You do not, you cannot appreciate me."  Then, changing her tone, forgetting her pride in her excitement, she cried, passionately: "Oh I why do you thus torture me? Why do you thus recall the bitter past? Why have you brought to my memory that fearful afternoon?"   ERASING YET NOBLE- -    S0   6 "t Simply to tell you," said Mrs. Singerlv, with a smile, " that were it possible that afternoon could come again, I should act very differently.. I should not decide against you ; I should not refuse my consent." "What do you say, madam?" cried Julia, in amazement, doubting if she had heard aright. "Do you not understand her?" cried Charles, eagerly, now speaking for the first time during tlf interview, and addressing himself to Julia. "Do you not understand our mother?" "Our mother!" repeated Julia. "Yes," said Charles. "My mother and yours. I cannot keep you and myself in suspense any longer. But we wished to surprise you with your happiness. Your true love, your virtue, have conquered my dear old mother's heart at last. She refuses her consent to our paradise no more. She yields. You are to be my wife, her daughter. Come to my arms, to my heart. Do you understand now?"  And in his excitement Charles, too, arose from the settee, and clasped Julia tightly, rapturously to his breast. Oh I the bliss of that long embrace I Oh! how her lover kissed her! Kissed her dark hair, kissed her broad forehead, kissed her swimming eyes, kissed her blushing cheek, kissed her superb lips, while his arm encircled her waist, as though he feared that she might elude his grasp like some angelic vision. Oh, the rapture of that moment! It well repaid the lovers for all the agonies of their separation. Their weary days of dreaming and vain yearning ; their weary nights of loneliness and sighing ; these were all forgotten now, as though they had not been. Wherefore,' truly, should they be remembered-?  Were they not together now, form to form, lip to lip, heart to heart? Were they not together now forever? If earth uponl that summer's day held within its vast circumference two mortals: who had borrowed for a while the bliss of heaven, these two ' n9P stood in the centre of that plainly-furaished room in that   quiet Virginia farm-house, with their arms around each other,   and their mother looking on.  While just without the open    356     -   ERRING, YET 'OBLTE. window sang the birds merrily, and whispered the breeze softly, and shone the sun brightly, and smiled the fields greenly. "But come, my child, my Julia, my daughter, am I not to have my kiss and my embrace, too, as well as my monopolizing son?" Could it be Mrs. Singerly, the reserved, stately mother of Charles, who spoke these light and loving words? Could it be the same woman, who once bfnished her from her presence, who now summoned her to her embrace? Julia asked herself this question, but when she turned and saw Mrs. Sin gerly standing, with her arms outstretched and a sweet smile upon her expres. sive face, the question was answered. With a glad cry Julia, abandoning her lover, rushed into his parent's arms. For a moment no word was spoken ; but then cried Julia, all her pride departed, "Madam i" "NTay, call me mother i" "I Mother! Obh, in what an indescribable tone this word was uttered by the, till now, motherless Julia I "Mother," she cried, unconsciously using the words of Holy Writ, ' I am not worthy to be called thy child-can you forgive me? I never can forgive myself. Only I will love you so-and him. Oh, God, I am so happy I But I am not worthy to be your daugh- ter. I thought so once ; but my pride is gone now." "My child, my Julia I you are talking folly," replied her new found mother. "You are worthy to be the daughter of tho chiefest princess or the best woman on earth. Ah! you have taught me, my daughter, a lesson which I shall never forget. A lesson for which I shall ever thank you.", "And this lesson, mother?" interrupted Julia. "Is, that every human being, whether man or woman, may fall, and rise again. Rise higher than before their fall. That to no sin should forgiveness be refused, if truly repented, for- saken and atoned. That the darkest stains may often mar the noblest creatures, who are most glorious, nevertheless. This may not be the doctrine of the world, which is ever unjust, and especially to women. This may not be the doctrine of the   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         357 rigidly-bigoted orthodox, such as I once was. But it is the experience of this summer, the teaching of truth, of your life, my daughter, of my own heart and my own soul."  Mrs. Singerly spoke these words with feeling and solemnity. "Alas I my mother," said Julia, "spite of all your comfort, I feel that I am erring "-- "Yet noble," cried Charles. "But away with the past, my own one. It has been a brief season of cloud and storm, but "we have improved the tempestuous hours, and will be all the better and the happier for them. Let us live but in the charm- ing present, and the long, long, bright, glorious, blessed future. We are safe at last; we are in haven and in heaven-rthe heaven of a mutual love. See, my Julia, how nature smiles upon us I The sky is as cloudless as our hopes. Let us thank OUR MOTHER. With one accord the lovers embraced their mother and each other simultaneously. And Mrs. Sinngerly felt herself more than repaid for all the self-struggles ,it had cost her to bring about this happy result. One moment of silent, speechless tenderness and happiness; then the voice of Mrs. Singerly was heard, saying: Now let us thank OUR -FATHER.?' And, with one accord, the three bodies, that contained the three happiest hearts on earth; knelt down and offered up their praises unto heaven. They knelt with the rude settee for an altar. It was not an imposing shrine. But what of that? The Holy One is above all outward ceremony! They knelt-Julia in the middle, with her hand in that of Charles' mother, and her waist encircled by the arm of Charles himself. A   charming group-emblematic both of earthly love and heavenly. And, suddenly, the voice of Charles' mother broke the silence of the scene. "Oh, God of love 1" she cried, "grant that we, who have by Thine infinite mercy been reunited, and who have, by time,. separation and affliction; been taught Thy wisdom,    35&   -    ERRING, YET NOBLE. may ever remember Thy past lessons, and abide in our present love." They arose, and kissed each other-and it was all over. Their probation was ended.  They had entered into their reward. And thus, Julia Witherson realized thetruth of that delicious passage of Holy Writ : "'Heaviness may endure for a night; but joy, joy cometh in the morning." Nobility has been on trial, and has received a verdict in its favor.       ' *    BOOK T"         STXTH. S A MAN ON TRIAL.                ii CHAPTER I.                    V HE LOVED NOT WISELY, BUT TOO WELL. DURING the summer so eventful to Charles and Julia, an epi sode occurred in the life of Miss Kate Somers, which we will now record, as illustrative of the character of our fair friend. Let us look at her now, as she sits in the Sunday-school build- ing attached to the fashionable church of St.   ,near the country town where her family are spending the summer. She is teaching her class; for Sunday-school teaching is fash- ionable, and so Miss Kate Somers is a Sunday-school teacher. Long may she flourish to show unto others the way to a happy place which she will never, by any possibility, reach herself! She sits, elegantly attired, with her dress so arranged as to display to the greatest possible advantage her fine arms. Look I how she is constantly exhibiting her hand, her white, delicate hand. Look I how she, ever and anon, displays her charming foot, and gives the male teachers present a distracting glimpse of her exquisite ankle. Her pretty, pale'face, her beautifully fair complexion, her fine, blue eyes, whose only fault is their coldness of seeming, her lips, whose only error is their thinness, these make up a captivating picture. Her auburn hair falls in long ringlets around her graceful form. Taken altogether, she makes a very good-looking Sunday-school teacher I Her dress, though, might be somewhat more decent, we think. She dis-   380        ERRING, YET NOBLE. plays more of her arms and bosom than is fitting in a Sunday- school teacher, or in a truly modest woman I And we are sorry to state that if you were to put your hand into the pocket of her dress you would find a copy of the latest and worst French novel (though Miss Somers always tells her gentle- nen-frieads that she does not approve at all of modern French literature). This novel is "got up" in elegant style, and looks outwardly not unlike a prayer-book. In fact, it is sometimes used slyly in the place of one by our virtuous, religious, highly- respectable friend, communicant, Sunday-school teacher, and hy- pocrite. During the summer, Miss S. made the acquaintance of a Mr. Leonard Carleton, a young gentleman of good family. We call him ".young gentleman"; he was, properly' speakiig, a mere boy, being but nineteen years of age. He was a handsome fel- low, but effeminate-looking--more like a woman than a' man ; wild, passionate, dreamy, weak, and unpractical; with a vague, yearning, sad expression about his eyes, as of one predestined to misfortune. Yet till the hour he met with Kate Somers he had known not what sorrow was. Nor did he know it then,' at first. [But a rapturous bliss seized upon the spirit of the enthusiastic youth, and made him its willing prisoner. Love's captives are willing ones. - He met her, he loved her. From the hour he first beheld her, he poured upon her shrine all the fond treasures of his heart. He dreamt of her by night. In visions he saw her light curls floating upon the breeze; he heard her voice, that voice to his ears so full of music; he heard her gay laugh ; and thus his sleep was happy. And in his waking moments he was seldom from her side. He was her com- panion, her attendant, her servant, her slave, call him what you will, he was always with her-ready to wait upon her every whim ; glad to contribute to her every caprice. But to his fond, foolish eyes, she had no caprice or whim. She was his saint, his star, his angel, and his all in all. Laugh at him, if you will, but even iu this dull, prosaic nine- teenth-century world of ours-this post-office, steam-car, tele-   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         361 graph, "iron-clad" world-there is such a thing to be occasion- ally met with as lote--ardent, passionate, wild, fond, devoted, heart-filling, soul-thrilling, all-compelling, all-worshiping, true-as. God love. And the love of Leonard Carleton was such a love l Alas I alas i that it should have been devoted to such a paltry woman-thing as Katherine Somers 1 Oh I the wild idolatry of love I Gods I there is naught to be compared with it I It is like itself alone 1 Ambition's fires pale before its ardor as do the night's white stars before the rising of the great red sun. Pleasure in all the rosy warmth of its merri- ment is cold and lifeless when placed in contrast with the joyous heat of such a passion. What are cards to woman's curls? What is the love of wine to the love of woman? Even the wor- ship of gold, even the miser's thirst and hunger, which is the meat and drink of his metallic soul, has not in it half the ardor with which the man's heart panteth for the mistress of his heart! What is silver to sweet lips? What is the love of gold to the golden love of woman? Oh! the mad, hot blood of passion I Ohl I the wild idolatry of love! Leonard Carleton loved Kate Somers.   Why did he love her? *  * "' Curious fool, be still! Is human love the growth of human will "-' Perchance it was because she was pretty, and his imagination fancied her to be beautiful I Perchance because he endowed her with a host of virtues which she did not possess I Perchance because " love lay in his way, and he found it"! Perchance be- cause he was young and foolish I Perchance because she, Katte ,Somers, coquetted with him, and led him on, and trifled with his inexperience 1 Perchance because it was his fate I At any rate, be loved her. Did she love him? Why ask such an absurd question? Can stones love? Are coquettes and unprincipled female hypocrites capable ofpassion? Do crocodiles sing? Do snakes fly? Be- sides, she considered him but a " mere boy," and trifled with him as such, though she knew that he loved her. Besides, Leonard's 16   362        ERRING, YET NOBLE. family was not rich. Besides, there was Singerly who was rich And, besides Singerly, there was Hericht. Did she love him? Does a penny candle give as much light as a full moon? Can a pitcher hold a river? Can a dwarf lift a giant? Can a coquette love? No; but she can flirt so capitally that she can give a man every reason to believe she loves him, and yet not absolutely commit herself. She can play at the game of " fast and loose" with him; she can be now " off" and now " on"; she can now smile and now frown ; she can now melt and now freeze ; be to- day cordial, kind, and loving, with her expressive eyes and her soft hand, and then to-morrow meet him with a formal bow and conventional phrases. She can do all this, and so make a hell of a young man's heart, with its alternate hopes and fears. And thus Leonard Carleton, to-day, was full of hope. She smiled upon him, therefore she loved him. Yes, her heart was his, and the sweet assurance made him feel as glorious as an emperor-nay, more than an emperor, an almost god. But the morrow came, and then she smiled not. She did not love him. And chaos was come again. What was life worth to him without her love? Why had he been born? She did not love him. At last the contest of these fierce emotions of hope and fear began to tell upon his physical frame,. and his mind lost its vigor. He determined to end the matter. He would declare his'love, and know his fate. After all, his fears must be but imaginary; his hopes must be real; she had given him every modest encouragement. Surely she loved him. Only a few words spoken and she was his forever. It was a dark and stormy night; cold, and black, and windy, and horrible. God help all poor houseless wretches I It was one of those nights in which it is especially terrible to be poor.. But it was also one of those very nights in which it' is supremely delicious to be rich in this world's goods, to have elegant accommodations, all the appliances of modern ease and civilized luxury; such, for instance, as   ERRING, YET NOBLE.       363 are to be found in the fine large parlors in the country resi. dence of Mr. Somers. In these rooms were seated Miss Kate herself and her devoted adorer, Leonard Carleton. They were alone. No fear of intruders on such a night of storm as this. Kate looks charmingly, and is dressed bewitchingly. Her arms, her hands, her little feet, that glimpse of her delicious ancle How suggestive is this last in its tempting rotundity, and its tapering beauty I Ah, Leonard Carlton, thou of the handsome but too womanly face, thou of the sad dreamy eye, beware, beware! "Ah, Leonard," cried Kate, in an artificially tender voice, "sing for me!' Her companion was charmed with the tenderness, but he detected not the artifice. And so Leonard Carlton sang a love lay for Kate Someis. It was a simple, touching thing, expressive of deep and everlasting passion. The refrain ran thus- "I have loved, do love, will love thee, Thee only everlastingly." Thus sang Leonard; his vague, dreamy, sad, beautiful eyes were full of a passionate light; his voice trembled with excess of emotion; his face grew almost unearthly in the charm of the burning feelings it expressed; his soul was in his song. "Thee only;" none on earth but thee; no one of all its myriad daughters save " only thee ;" " thee everlast- ingly;" thee in health and thee in sickness; thee in wealth and thee in poverty; thee in joy and thee in sorrow; thee through life, thee through death, and thee throughout eter- nity; thee on earth and thee in heaven; thee with man and thee with God. His song was his soul. He ceased. "How expressively you sing, Leonard I One could almost imagine that you really felt and meant all that the-words imply." So jestingly spoke she; and thus answered he- "Ah, Kate, I do feel, I do mean it all. Aye, more than all that song ca n mean I feel for thee. Kate, I love you, I   364       ERRING, YET NOBLE. adore you. Nay, I am not talking wildly, or if I am, the truth is very wild. You are all I hope for here; even the great hereafter can give me nothing more. Since I saw you I worshiped you; my days. as you know full well, have been all yours; my nights have been but dreams about you. I see you in the sun and in the stars, and all the use that music has is to remind me of your voice. Your eyes haunt me in my sleep; the touch of your soft hand thrills through my every nerve ; I am but what you choose to make me. None have ever loved as I do ; men have felt love before ; but Kate, dear Kate, I feel idolatry : See, I kneel, to you as my all in all, my God ; I cannot, will not, must not live without you. Without you my life would be a long, long* agony; no, not a long, a very brief one ; for death would quickly come and end it. But why should I talk of death? my whole life I here devote to thy service; 'thee only everlastingly ;' I know I am not worthy thee; who is? But, Kate, the stars shine brightly on this wicked world, and do not hide their blessed light because the world is wicked. Oh! be my wife, sweet Kate; wilt thou hot? Say but ' yes,' the sweet and short word ' yes,' and all my future shall be as devoted to thee as it shall be blessed by thee. But answer ' no ' and, oh, God I I shall die. But thou wilt not say me nay; I feel thou wilt not. My all, my soul, my life, my fate, my heart are in thy hands, are at thy feet. Bid me rise and call thee mine, my sweet, my angel Kate l" He ceased, and the music of his impassioned words was silent; but his eye still spoke in a language unmistakable. Ah, coquetry I thou hast completed thy work I Now for a final and conclusive stroke of art I Miss Somers was at first "ssurprised that Mr. Carleton should have entertained feelings of which she had never formed the slightest idea." Then she said " she was grieved that Mr. Carleton should cherish sentiments towards her that it never could be in her power to reciprocate; she should always like him, esteem him, and so on" (the old tune), "but love him   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        365 was utterly out of the question." And at last Miss Somers grew indignant. "What reason had she ever given him to lead him to imagine that her feelings towards him were aught but those of friendship? What encouragement had she shown hinm?' etcetera, etcetera. The scene was over. Kate Somers went to bed that night, smiling and humming an opera air. Did she feel any remorse? Have stones consciences? Has a crocodile any idea of moral responsi- bility? Does the snake regret the bird that it has just fas- cinated and destroyed? Would you expect moral light from a penny candle? Would you expect a noble river to flow from a paltry pitcher? or a dwarf to be capable of a gigan- tic action? Did she feel remorse? What an absurd question I Kate Somers went to bed smiling. Leonard Carleton did not go to bed at all. Oh, reader, do you know what a horrible feeling love-despair is? If not, down on your knees and thank God I Devoutly bless your Maker that he has preserved you from the worst pang that mortal man or woman can ever ex- perience this side of eternal condemnation I Sickness, poverty, blasted ambition, care-these are bad enough. But we tell you they are blessings of paradise compared to the horrible and black despair of blighted love. Reader, down on your knees, we say, and thank God that your name was not Leonard ,Carleton I It was on a Saturday that' Kate Somers rejected her victim. On the next day (Sunday morning) at nine o'clock, she was seated in, the Sunday-school room of the fashionable church of Saint  , teaching piously her class. And at half- past ten she was to be seen in her family pew in the aforesaid fashionable church, with her fine eyes devoutly cast upwards- Truly God must have been pleased with the worship offered him by such a woman as Katherine!

From the day his love- bubble burst, all his happiness and hope departed. He never   G66        EBPRRINGa, YET NOBLE. blamed Kate Somers.  He had not even force enough to despise her, to cease to love her. Strange as it may seem, he was still infatuated. Alas! there is no insanity like that of passion I There is no madness like the madness of the heart I When his father-man of the world-laughed at his folly.; when his mother, she of the kind and tender soul, heaped her reproaches upon the false Kate, Leonard bore with a dull patience the laughter of the one, but defended his idol vehemently against the attacks of the other. "He never blamed her, never"?' He had not strength to blame ; his heart was broken. He never smiled. But he laughed wildly sometimes; for he betook himself to dissipation. He drank deep, he gambled, he reveled of nights. But it was all in vain. His late hours ruined his physical health; he lost heavily at play; and lie went mad with drink.  And that was all. For he could not banish Kate. He saw her by his side at the gaming-table; and she visited him nightly in his maddened dreams. And at last he died. They styled his disease the delirium of liquor. We call it the delirium of a coquette. And yet, in the world's Dictionary, Miss Witherson is a fallen, while Miss Somers is a pure woman.   Who will present the world with a new Dictionary?   EBRINGO, YET NOBLE.        36T CHEAPTER     II. a BY THE SAD, SEA WAVES." DURING the summer, another episode occurred, which, as it concerned Julia materially, though indirectly, we will take this opportunity to narrate. The Kincarde family, since Uncle Shine's death, have been spending the most of their time at their cottage on the sea-shore. Let us go thither and look after the Kincardes-or rather, Mrs. Kincarde herself, who is the one of the family. In an obscure, secluded portion of the beach, at some distance from "Shell" cottage, as the Kincarde residence was called, and almost entirely unknown to the sojourners at "Sea-side City," Mrs. Kincarde, with a singularity of taste which was one of her chief characteristics, had caused to be erected a rustic arbor and a bath-house. The arbor was a very odd affair, of considerable heighth, grotesquely ornamented, and many sided, looking somewhat like the outside frame of a gigantic kaleido- scope; while the bath-house, on the contrary, was rounded, and not unlike a small shot-tower or light-house. They stood near together, at a distance from the sea, in a small grove, through the openings of which the ocean was plainly visible. A sort of foot-path led from these singrular structures to the beach on one extremity, and to the road to Sea-side City on the other. The scenery around was very wild and desolate; a few stunted trees scattered here and there; any amount of arid sand ; a few fishermen's huts in the distance -these, and the everlasting sea, with its far-off "lwhite caps' and its white- sailed ships, with an occasional sea-bird, were all that was visible; while the only sound that greeted the ear was the murmuring voice of mighty ocean.   // 368        , ERRING, YET NOBLE. It was to this lonely spot that 1Mrs. Kincarde came, one sum mer's afternoon. She was alone, and seating herself in the higthest or third story of the remarkable arbor just referred to, drew out her pocket;glass and surveyed the horizon. She had always been fond of the sea, fond of tales of storms and shipwreck ; and she now gazed seaward, as though beholding the faice of a friend, or like a land-bird, fascinated by a sea-serpent! She is an ugly woman. Her tall, lean form is very ungrace- ful and most angular; her sharp features are utterly destitute of beauty ; but at the same time, her grey eyes are wonderful, deep, restless, passionate, yet cold; shrewdly speculative, and strangely attractive. They arg full with an unnatural light, which hardly seems of earth. And her homely, though most intellectual and willed, countenance has a peculiar expression upon it, which can hardly be described in words. She is dressed in an expensive, gaudy, outre, -tasteless style, as though she wished to be in attire, as in other points, different from the majority of her sex. And there she sits,!ookingo hrough her glass upon that mighty, restless ocean, which she loves. For a while she gazes. Then she lays down the glass and takes up a book, which she has brought with her from the library at *' Shell Cottage."  As is to be expected from the sister of "Uncle Shine,"- thile volume is a' trans- lation of one of the most dangerous works of one of the most dangerous of modern French infidels. A work in which manl's belief in a God is ridiculed as the most contemptible folly conceivable; in which all religion is satirized as super- stition. But as the author's views coincide with those of Mrs. Kincarde, the reader is very much delighted with her volume. And yet is it not a sad sight, that old woman, with her gray hair, defying thus the God before whom she must one day, per- haps-erelong, appear? And all the time - before her very eyes that great sea, which she so loves, and which He made-He, whose very existence her favorite French philosopher denies. Yet so it is. And her breast expands with pride, as she thinks   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         369 how superior she is to the superstition of her race. She is no fool to be frightened by a God-not she I No, truly. And yet this very independent and wise woman, who is more learned in her own conceit than Bayle, Newton, Locke, or Paul, is gross idiot enough to place implicit faith in the vagaries of Spiritualism. She does not believe in Christ  but she does believe in rappings, knockiugs, mediums, spirit-circles, and all the paraphenalia of modern charlatanism. Oh I human nature I ]Mrs. Kincarde reads for a while, then again takes up her glass and gazes seaward. But no sail is in sight. So, folding her arms, she looks thoughtfully, dreamily, upon the -ocean. Her love for the sea is the only romantic or unworldly feature in her disposition; in all other respects she is hard and practical enough ; but in her yearning admiration for the grand, old ocean she is indeed a poet. Does the sea return her affection? Would not the ocean overwhelm and destroy her, if it had a chance, as ruthlessly as it would overwhelm and destroy any other human being? We fear it would. But will it ever have a chance? After gazing upon the ocean a while, and dreaming strange day-dreams about it, Mrs. Kincarde's attention becomes diverted to the arbor in which she is sitting. It needs some repairs, she thinks. This essentially material subject breaks the romantic current of her recent thougrhts, and her mind then wanders off to various other matters. SlShe thinks of the loss of the Shiner property, consequent on her brother's singular will, and she al- most cunrses-his memory. She also curses heartily Julia Wither- son, as the recipient of the wealth that should never have -been hers. But she congratulates herself that she has a life-interest in a large portion of her brother's estate. True, after her death this interest reverts to Julia Witherson, by the will of the testa- tor. ]But what of that? She will live for years; and before her death she trusts, by legal proceedings already instituted, to be able to set the whole will of her dead brother aside. So once more she curses Julia. But let her remember that ,                        - - 16*  -   870        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "curses are like young chickens, and always come home to roost." Now she again gazes intently and lovingly upoli the ocean. And suddenly she is seized with a strange but irresistible longing to plunge for a while into its waters. Mrs. Kincarde seldom indulges in a sea-bath ; it is too strong a luxurv for her feeble constitution. But there are exceptions to all rules. The ocean is mild this afternoon; the beach is safe.; she will remain in the water but a few minutes ;   and, accordilgly, her mind is resolved. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, she descenids from her high position in the singularly-shaped arbor, and wends her way toward the equally odd bath-house. The bathinag-robes of the family, including her own, are here kept under a lock and key, which was of Mr. Shiner's own invention, and defies picking. She will have no trouble upon this point. It is true that hitherto, on each of the very rare occasions on which she has bathed in the ocean, she has always been aIt- tended by one of her family. But this afternoon she has con- ceived the whim of bathing alone and unaided. Being an obsti- nate woman, we need not wonder that she is now bent upon put- ting her whim into execution. If she had no other reason, it would suffice to her that she is determined to prove to her husband and ler daughter that they are very munch mistaken in their idea that she is so feeble as to be unable to take care of herself. So, as willful woman will have her way, and as there are none present to prevent Mrs. Kincarde from having hers, the odd old woman enters her round bath-house, and attires herself in her grotesque bathing-robes. We know not how it is, but so it is, that while she robes her angular limbs in her sea-costume, she thinks 'of all the dead men who have died by the shore of the very -sea into which she is now about to plunge. And with- these images of horror in her milid she rushes, with a speed most unusual for her, from the bath-house to the ocean. There are no living beings in sight. As she turns her gaze   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         371 upon the shore, she sees but a grove, through the openings of which, the many-sided arbor and the rounded bath-house are visible. Only this,-and sand, and above her the clear sky, and beneath her, around her feet, the waters of the sea. She gazes upon these familiar objects intently, and for some timle-why, we cannot guess; we but record-the fact. And then she turns her  face seaward, and advances into the deeper water. The bath is delicious! the cooling sensation is most glorious I She enjoys it to the utmost. Who says she is unable to take care of her- self? Why, now she feels as though she were young again- as though she were but a girl. And in her joy she blesses the ocean and talks to its waters wildly. There are few things in life so truly delightful as a bath in the sea! It far surpasses all conceivable fresh-water bathings! But oh, God of mercy! what is this?  She has ventured out too far! She feels herself irresistibly impelled yet farther 1 Her limbs refuse to do their office. It is not terror that has seized upon them. NTo, Mrs. Kincarde is a brave woman, espe- cially in emergencies. It is paralysis!-a sudden paralysis, aris- ing, perhaps, from the reaction of the excessive exertion and excitement, which she has just undergone, perchance from other causes; we are not medical, and therefore simply record the truth. She is being carried out to sea. She is powerless to prevent it. Horrible fate-but certain I She, shrieks, but no living being hears her cries! There are many thousands of men and women not far from her-thousands who are, at this very moment, sipping their cobblers, or sailing, or fishing, or flirting in the piazzas of the hotels, or reading novels or sleeping in their rooms. Thousands who are merry-very probably on the otler side of the angle of the beech, which bounds her view of the shore, there may be many bathing at this very time. But none of these men or women hear her cry ; even if it was heard, help could not be brought in time to save her. She knows not how to swim; even had she the knowledge, she has not now the power; she is sinking fast; sinkinrg into the waters; into the   37822       . ERRING, YET NOBLE. sea she has loved so well; into the sea she has gazed at from the shore for so many long hours. More than this--she is sinking into death, into eternity! We wonder if she is as fond of French infidels now as she was an hour since? We wonder if she believes now in a heaven, a hell, a hereafter, and a living, tangible, just-judging God? . We wonder if the waters of the everlasting ocean have not taulght her a new theological lesson? We know not. All we know is, that she gives no sign--she dies game. She utters no cry to God! Gives utterance to no penitential sentiment. She merely raises a sharp cry of anguish-holds a vio- lent struggle with death ; looks her last upon the sky, with its sum-' mery fleecing clouds ; and the shore, with its beech, grove, bath- house, and arbor ; looks her last upon the waters of the cruel sea, which thus returns her worship ,; thinks that had it not been for her own eccentricity, in placing her bath-house so far from the rest, she might -now have received aid; thinks once more upon all those who died beside the very sea in which now herself is perishing; thinks of, God only knows what else beside. Then the waters close, and she is lost to human sight forever. Her body was never recovered. The sea, in this case, claimed her as peculiarly its own. Her bones are, probably, lying in some ocean cavern, and strange monsters sport around them. They will never be raised, until the day of general, and awful resurrection! And, at the moment, the very second of her final disappear- ance beneath the waves, a little incident takes place. The leaves of the infidel book, which the dying woman had just been read- ing, and which she had left upon the seat in the arbor, are agi- tated by a gentle breeze, and open on a page on which com- mences a chapter, headed : "Is there a God?" By Mrs. Kincarde's death, Julia Witherson's inheritance from George H. Shiner, was materially increased. Besides all fear of legal proceedings vanished with her only formidable opponent. Julia was now not only a large but an undisputed heiress.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        3 3 CHAPTER      III. THE TWO SINNERS AND THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. DURING this eventful summer Henry Hericot in turn en- countered a peculiar adventure, which it is our intention, in the present chapter, particularly to describe. Fanny Walters, though living in the same city with ler betrayer, and anxious to meet him face to face, lhad never yet  chanced. upon him. Once she fell on his track, but yet he escaped her. Since that time, up till the middle of July, her search for her destroyer was unsuccessful. Though Herioot was a frequenter of houses such as those which formed her "home," yet he never happened to patronize the particular establishment in which she lived. Though he daily promen- aded Broadway, and she likewise, yet, strange as it may  sound, they never met. But Fanny had many other matters to occupy her mind. Shel was not like many women, a monomaniac on the subject of her wrongs and her revenge; she dashed and coquetted, and was gay and reckless, dressed gor. geously and dined luxuriously. And occasionally, during the summer she visited her sister in the country, brought her presents, kissed her, gave her loving and most excellent advice, and then returned to her vice and. extravagance. And so the month of June and the earlier half of July passed by, and were gathered, with all their records of good and evil, fwith the years before the flood. One afternoon, the 15th July (wh'ich, by-the by, was Fanny's twentieth birth-day), she, accompanied by a female of her own class, took a ride in the Park. There was music in "the Central" that afternoon, by a well-known band, and a great concourse were assembled. Hundreds, we may, per-   8374      EPuRINrG, YET NOBLE. chance, say truthfully, thousands of men, women and chil. dren were gathered together, presentfing a varied picture of great attraction. Men with gray hair; young men with the faintest percep- tible trace of a mustache; toddling children, with scarce a hair upon their heads; women, aged, wrinkled, bowed down, melancholy; brilliant women, in the prime of life, sweepinge' proudly by, drawn in their elegant equiparge's by yet more elegant spans of superb horses; young girls roaming about, laughing and chatting gaily; rich men in their carriages; "fast" young-fellows in their stylish turnouts; mechanics and laborers with their families, seated in groups upon the grass, enjoying an economical pic-nic; the wearied man of business, the darkly-whiskered, eVil-eyed gambler; the faithful nurse, with the merry little children ; the escaped shop-girls; the young lady and her lover, sauntering slowly amidst the trees and the sunlight towards thlo more secluded portions of the Park; ever and anon some well-known man, some leading lawyer, editor, volunteer officer or politician, walking with his staff of satellites and toadies, an object of general attention; ugly men  and handsome men; ugly women and handsome women; people in purple and people in rags; clergymen, thieves, venders of small wares, women of virtue and respectability; women of no respecta- bility or virtue whatever; beggars and policemen; fat Ger- mans, stout Englishmen, hard-featured Scotchmen, good- natured, though rather dirty and jolly Irishmen. These and many more classes of humanity were presented, while the band, surrounded by a gaping crowd of idlers. their brass instruments glistening in the sunlight, discoursed most eloquent music; which, though it occasionally startled some high-spirited steed with its trumpet notes, sounded deliciously to the pleasure-voyagers upon the not distant and delightful lake, which was here and there visible through the openings in the groves; while the fresh, green, gorgeous grass, the sweet-scented, rarely-painted flowers, the clear   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        375 cloudless sky, the balmy air, combined with all the human panorama presented to the eye, formed a combination of attractions well worth study and admiration. And amidstythis gay and varied scene Fanny Walters and her companion passed and repassed in their elegant, though, of course, hired vellicle. Her companion was a woman, ugly and vulgar, who looked her real character, but Fanny herself was gorgeously beautiful; never in all her life had she looked' more charming; and as she rode by, thoughl the glances of the women expressed their contempt for her, yet the eyes of all men, young and old, rested upon her with admiration. We may here, en passsant, ask the authorities of our cities, our civic magistrates, if it is not too much, this allowing notorious characters not only to fester our streets, but also to pollute with their presence our squares, parks, and public places by day? But to return to Fanny Walters. Just as she was on the point of giving the driver orders to return to the city, thinking that she 1had heard enough of the music for one afternoon, she suddenly started, and her countenance assumed an expression utterly indescribable, because compounded of so many conflicting emotions. She saw a face in the crowd, a face which she had nlot seen for years, which she had sought after long and earnestly, a handsome but a bad face, that of Henry Hericot. The - emories of her wrongs rushed to her heart in a bitter tide of passion; she had sworn revenge upon him whenever and wherever she might meet him. Now, now is the time for vengeance t With her eyes flashincg with the lightnings of hate, she was about to springcr from the carriage, rush to Hericot, who, surrounded by several of his gay com- panions, was standing at some distance; and do she knew not what, but something terrible, when her companion, who had watched her with astonishment, seized her by the arm and prevented her design. The carriage with the two women passed on, and when it returned in its course to the spot where Fanny Walters had seen Hericot, he was gone. " '   876        ERRING, YET NOBLE. This incident may seem unimportant ; but it will cease to appear so when we record the following brief dialogue between Hericot and one of his companions, as they were leaving the Park that afternoon: "Who was that girl in the carriage, whom we saw just now -attempting to spring out in a furious manner? I merely caught a glimpse of her face, but in some strange way it appeared fa- miliar." These were the words of Hericot, and his companion re- plied : "Oh, that was Fanny Walters, one of the gayest girls in town. She lives at Madame D  . 's. She has lived there for years. You must have met her there."         , "  No," said Hericot, "I could not have met her at Madanme D   's, for the simple reason that I have never been inside of that establishment in my life." "Never been to Madame D----'s? Why, you surely must be jesting." "No. Somehow or other, it has always happened that when- ever I have determined to visit that place, and have set out for that purpose, something or other has turned up to take me else- where. I seem fated in this respect." "Pshaw! make one more trial, Hericot. Come with me, there to-night, and see this Fanny Walters. She is the gayest girl ill town." "Agreed," cried Hericot, "I will make it a point to go with you to-night and see this woman, whom you call 'Fanny Wal- ters.' Her face haunts me. I have known that woman before, I am certain ; but where? I cannot place her."  "No matter," replied his friend, "you will find out all about it to-night." "So be it," said Hericot. So the result of this little incident in the Park this summer's afternoon proved to be that Henry Herioot, himself, is on the point of satisfying unconsciously Fanny Walters' dearest wish, and is about to gratify her longing for revenge. She has not   EARRING, YET NOBLE.        37T hitherto been able to meet him; he, therefore, goes to meet her. Reader, there is such a thing as fatality.    Afternoon glides on toward evening; and, at last, night has come. RNight, with its twinkling stars, brilliant lights, noisy pleasure, and noisome sin. And Henry Hericot and his compan- ion wend their way to the establishment of Madame D This is the same house alluded to in Book Second -the house to which Julia Witherson paid, years Ago, a visit, in the vain hope to redeem one of its inmates, Fanny Walters, who has re- sided there ever since. When we first saw this house, it was closed--at noon. It is now open-at night. It was then visited by women ; it is now to be visited by len. The parlors were then darkl; they are now illuminated.- They were then tenantless ; they are now oc- cupied by a number of young women, painted and gaudily-dressed. Hericot and his companion reach the door and pull the bell. A wicked-looking old negress peers through the grating, opens the door, and recognizing one of the two, admits them both. It is rather early in the evening, and no visitors have yet arrived save themselves. Consequently, on this occasion there is none of the usual mystery and caution, but the young men are shown at once into the parlor. "But where is Fanny?" asks Hericot's companion. "Oh, she will be down directly," answers one of the women. "I wish to see her a moment." And so saying, the speaker, Hericot's companion, rushes from the room. Presently he makes his re-appearance, and whispers to Hericot : "I have told Fanny of your being struck with her this after- noon at the Park, and she desires to see you. I will remain with these women till your return." And Hericot, wondering somewhat at this departure fim the usual etiquette of these places, wends his way to the apartment of Fanny Walters. There Fanny is awaiting him in a strange commotion of feel-   378        ERRING, YET NOBLE. ing. She knows not whether her new visitor will prove to be her betrayer, the man whom she saw this afternoon in the Park, or merely one of the many men who might have observed her on the same occasion. And it is this doubt that has led her to receive her visitor privately. Hericot advances to the door of the apartment, and knocks. He hears a voice utter "Come in." He enters, and, for the first time for years, Henry Hericot and Fanny Walters are face to face. She occupies now the same, large, elegantly-furnished room as she did at the date of Julia Witherson's first visit to her ; the walls are ornamented with the same highly-colored prints, and on the mantel-piece stands the samge fanciful old clock. But Fanny Walters is not now (as then) " clad in a hastily- donned morning-wrapper," but is attired in all the glory of full dress. She does look gloriously, even more superbly lovely than we beheld her this afternoon. Her fine form, her brilliantly dark complexion, her long, luxuriant, black hair, her perfectly- moulded, ring-sparkling hands, her handsome face, these chal- lenge all admiration. But more than admiration is inspired by her appearance at the present moment; her countenance has a passionate expressio n of joy, hate, grief, upon it that words can- not adequately render; her small, exquisitely-shaped mouth is curved in a scornful triumph ; and her deep black, restless, fiery eye " looks daggers " at the man who stands before her in aston- ishment. Astonishment at the expression of her countenance, astonishment at the likeness she bears to some one whom he has met and known before, though he cannot as yet recall whom. "Do you know me?  Do yov know me, Arthur Hantmiton, or whatever else your name may be? Do you know your victim-?" She asks this question with a menacing tone and a flashing eye. The name  Arthur Hamilton," the name he had assumed when be betrayed the girl now known as "Fanny Walters," recalls scenes long forgotten. He remembers her now.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         379 "Do you know me? Answer, I say!" and she dilates her form and stamps passionately with her little, exquisitely delicate foot upon the floor. ' Yes." Hericot at last finds words to utter, "You are "-- "The woman you have murdered!' interrupts the girl. "The woman who, ere she knew you, was as pure as the snow when it first falls from heaven. The woman who, ere you crossed her path, was the joy of her old father, and the pride of her true, young lover;who was once good and beloved, and therefore happy, oh, how happy I But you came; you, with your hand- some face and your city graces, and your smooth lies, 'and your devilish heart. You came, and I, in a fatal hour, lost all 1 Home, my father, my lover, myself, my soul I Like a cursed coward, you used art, or force. And I have become-what have I become?" she almost shrieked ; "what have I become, Arthur Hamilton?" "Now do not vex yourself into all this passion, and listen to me a moment," said Hericot, who, having recovered from hIis first shock of surprise, understood " the position," as he thought, having passed through somewhat similar scenes before this. "Let me but have a chance to talk to her a while," he reasoned, "and I will soon change her rage into something much more agreeable." To tell the truth, he had much reason to- think this, for, with the exception of Julia, he had never yet failed, by means of his wonderful power of tongue, to mollify and re-delude his female victims. But he mistook the nature of Fanny, who cried : "No, I will not listen to you again. It is now my time to speak. What have I become? I will tell you. A lost one- an outcast-a Camille, as you men of fashion phrase it. I am considered more vile than the very dust and refuse of the streets. True, I wear fine dresses, and receive costly presents, and am flattered. But the dresses are dearly purchased, and the gifts and flatteries are from those who despise me. No true woman associates with me, no true man visits me. 'Home,' 'wife,'   380        ERRING, YET NOBLE. 'mother,' husband,' 'children,' these are unknown words in the vocabulary of my horrible life. I am cursed of earth and of heaven. My father has cursed me, and the great God will. 1 am ruined here, I shall be damned hereafter." She spoke these awful words with a terrible emphasis. "I know all this, and I know, too, that you have been the cause of all. Were it not for you, I should have been, at this moment, a happy mother and an honored wife. May the curse of the Everlasting rest upon you." She drew herself up, as she spoke, to her utmost height, and her flashing eyes seemed to dart forth fire upon the amazed and really somewhat alarmed Hericot. Almost any other man would have been conscience-stricken, but he was not, for the simple reason that he had no oonscience whatever. He was merely somewhat in doubt whether she might not in her present state of excitement inflict some bodily injury upon him. He was a physical coward, and he dreaded an encounter with an enraged woman. In truth, Fanny Walters seemed as though she were on the point of rushing at him like an angry tigress. "I hate you, Arthur Hamilton!" she cries. "I have vowed revenge upon you. Why should I not have it now? You are in my power. I could kill you. Why should I not do so, Arthur Hamilton?" The demon of vengeance seemed now to have possession of her soul. She glared round the room wildly, as though in search of some instrument of death; then she looked at her destroyer fixedly, as though calculating his power of resistance did she attempt a personal rencontre. Herioot now, thoroughly fright- ened, endeavored to escape. But she, watching his every move- ment with a lynx-like eye, threw herself suddenly against the door, and thus barred his passage. And then she gazed at him a moment fixedly. He was white with fear, but as handsome as ever--villain and poltroon, as he was, his personal beauty was preeminent. He was elegantly dressed, too-attired with his usual artistic taste. And something in his attitude now, at this moment, reminded -   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         381 the woman who stood there gazing at him of " old times," of days long past, happy days, though brief and fatal, when his attitude was as graceful as the one he now assumed, though from very different causes. Would you believe it, reader, a sudden, strange, inexplicable, but palpable revulsion of feeling took place in the breast of Fan- ny Walters, caused by nothing else saving this chance coinci- dence of attitude? Of such wonderful elements are we made. Such is the power of association of ideas. An emotion of almost tenderness stole, suite of her resistance, into her heart toward the nian before her. Stle liad loved him once. His lips had been pressed tenderly to hers. Once she would have died for him. - The rage in her eye diminished; the scorn on her face lessened; she gazed at him regretfully, almost tenderly. Ah! woman is a remarkable creature I And the female heart is a most mysterious volume I! Hericot watched the change in his companion's delmeafnor, alid interpreted it correctly. His fear departed, and he smiled. He could soothe and conquer her yet. He assumed a tender look, and endeavored to take her hand. But she shuddered at his touch, and her face grew dark again. Still the crisis of violence in her mood was past, and Hericot used all his arts to pacify and please her. But a gloomy sadness seemed now, for a while, to take the place of her former rage, and his efforts to overcome it were vain. He glanced around the room. He saw a little book lying upon a table. His r6le was now to change the current of her thoughts. So, asking, in a light, gay tone, "What have we here?-some spicy French work for summer reading?" he opened the volume. It was a copy of the Holy Bible. Utterly surprised at seeing such a book in such a place, he turned to the fly-leaf,- and-could he believe his eyes?-there was Jnlia -Witherson's name inscribed upon it, and in her own handwriting-he knew it well. It seemed unaccountable.  A book of Julia's in a place   382        ERRING, YET NOBLE. like this 1 Could his companion have stolen it? Not think. ing of the abrupt of tof the question, he turned to Fanny, and asked: "How came this book here?" "It was given me by a kind friend," was the reply,-" the only fieLnd I have met for years. Why do you ask?" she said, sharply. "Did the person whose name is written here give it to you?" inquired Hericot, more intent upon discovering the history of this Bible than aught else at this moment. "Yes ; it was given me by the kind lady herself, in this room, with her own hands." "Are you certain it wag the owner herself?" "Yes--perfectly certain. But what is this to you?   You cannot know this good lady. She does not mingle with such as you. You could not try your cunning arts on her.' Alas I alas I Fanny Walters! In your gratitude to and ad. miration for the woman who once endeavored, though in vain, to save you, you have made a sad mistake. I And a devilish smile flits over the handsome lips of Henry He- ricot as he thinks how mnalapropos his companion's words are on this subject. But his smile is succeeded by a look of perplexity, as he endeavors to account for Julia's acquaintanceship with and visit to such a woman as Fanny and in such a place as this. "I will find out all about it presently," he thinks ; " it may be of use to me hereafter.  At most astonishing girl that Julia!" "A rather strange book to come across in one's rambles," was the remark of Hericot, as he replaced the Bible, which had hith- erto been held in his hand, upon the table. These words seemed also malapropos; for, as soon as they were  uttered, Fanny Walters, looking full in his face, said : "You are right, Arthur- Hamilton," (she would persist to-night in calling him by the assumed name under which he had known her and destroyed her)-" you are right. It is a strange book to be in the -hands of such a man as you. It is a strange book   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        383 to be found in the room of such a creature as myself. Would to God it were fot so strange. You smile one of your abominable smiles. But I tell you, Arthur Hamilton, that though you may laugh at, yet I believe in that book. Yes; H-wretch that I am, wretch as I ever must and will be-do believe that that book is a true and good book. I used to read it often before I knew you-I read it even now, sometimes. It tells me what I might have been, but what I can never, never, never be." She spoke these words so sadly, yet so passionately : "It is a good book. And if I had but followed its precepts I would never have been here, and with you. And whose fault is it that I am here, in spite of the words of that Holy Book? Whose fault but yours? 'Thou-art the man!' I read those words sometimes in that Bible. And again I say,--'Thou art the man 1' 1" And she pointed her finger towards her companion, and her eye seemed to pierce the very secrets of his wicked soul; while he, overawed by her earnestness, felt for a moment as David must have felt in the presence of the angry prophet, Nathan. But he recovered himself, and said, lightly: "Pshaw I let us drop the Bible, as you call it. I have much to say to you, Mary." He called her for the first time by her old and real name-the name by which she was known in her pure childhood. He called her by her old name tenderly, thinking it would recall to her the days of their mutual love. And so it did. But, alas! she re- membered that these were also the days of mutual guilt-that her lover was also her betrayer.* The' latter horrible memories overpowered the former delicious ones. And she cried: "Call me not, Mary; call me not again by the sweet name of my girlhood, unless you wish me to strangle you. And I will not 'drop the Bible,"' she continued. "Listen to me. There zs a God, and you know it and feel it; and He will call you to judgment some day.  Aye, to judgment! And He will judge you by this very Bible. He will say to you, Arthur Hamilton, or whatever else you may be called. you once knew v               o'   g38: '      ERRING, YET NOBLE. a young, and happy, and virtuous woman. What did you with her? And then you will be forced to answer, like a trembling coward, 'I lied to her, pretended love to her, and destroyed her forever.' Arid then He will destroy you, Arthur Hamilton."  As she spoke, her proud, magnificent form seemed almost to expand beyond its natural limits; her eye flashed forth -its most vivid lightnings ; her long, rich, black hair escaped from its confinement, and was flung over and down her shoulders; her dark face glowed; her exquisite mouth seemed endowed with the very grace of scorn; and her rounded arm seemled to be hurling the thunders of con. demnation. And Hericot gazed on this strange creature with wonder, mingled with fear. But he disguised the latter as well as he might, and said, in that light, careless tone, which he could adopt at pleasure, "Let us proclaim a truce to this war of tongues; let us end our melodrama, and be good friends, as we used to be. One would think, to hear you now, that you were a priest about to deliver a lecture upon the Ten Com- mandments." "The Ten Commandments! I did not suppose that you knew there were that many, or any," said Fanny, bitterly. Then she continued. "They tell us that one day He shall come with awful majesty to judge all men and all women  and He will judge us by this little book," taking in her hand the Bible (which, as our readers have ere this remembered, Julia gave to Fanny at the termination of their first inter- view, and which Fanny had ever since cherished as a keep. sake; aye, and even read occasionally). "Fancy that the time has come," she continues; " fancy that the heavens and earth have passed away ; that all the dead have become alive; that the ground and the sea have yielded up their multitudes; and that He is seated on His awful throne, with His eye of lightning, and His voice of thunder; that far beneath Him hell is yawning with its yells and agon.   ERRB'oG YET NOBLE.      388 ies, and eternal fires; and that you and I are standing before Him ."              '" As she drew this dread picture she seemed like one in- spired; and in his own despite, Hericot the infidel became, for the moment, Hericot "the devil, who believed and trembled." "Fancy all this," she continued, " and then fancy that He opens this dread book, this Bible, and He turns to me arid asks me, pointing to a certain chapter, ' Here are the com- mandments I have given you to live by. Have you lived by them?' And I will have to answer; ' No, oh, God I' And then He will ask, 'And wherefore not?' And then I shall turn to you and say to the Judge,'This man prevented me, oh, God I' And then, with an awful frown, He will look at you with an eye that will make you call upon the hills to cover you and hide you from its glance ; and He will say, 'Man, worm, sinner, I have told you to have no other God but, me, and, lo, you have made gods of youl' lies and your lusts.' And then He will open the Bible as I do now, at this very place where I now open it, at the twentieth chapter of a book called Exodus, and He, the great God, and the just Judge, will continue thus: "' Man, sinner, I have told thee, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, and thou hast thyself daily profaned it, and hast made this woman beside thee to lead such a life that she must needs blaspheme it also.

I have told thee, Tho% shalt not kill, yet thou hast slain her honor and her soul. Thou shalt not commit adultery, yet thou hast been all thy life an adulterer.

'      '  Think for a moment, reader, of the associations of this scene. There, in an evil house, surrounded by luxury and splendor, stands one of its handsome Evils, engaged in applying the words of Scripture to- one of her visitors! She stands erect, with the Bible in her beautiful jeweled hand, her chest heaving, the expression of her face indescribably grand, as though she, indeed, fancied herself the Judge, of whom she spoke. She stands by the gas-light, revealed in all het costly attire and gorgeous beauty, passionate, yet awful in her loveliness, with her long hair floating down her shoulders, her flashing eye fixed upon her companion, and her arm, rounded and magnificent, pointing solemnly downward, as though to the land of torment, to which she has just devoted her betrayer. While her handsome, elegantly-dressed, gentlemanly-looking visitor almost crouches before her; with the echo of her fear- fully solemn, because fearfully-true words still in h's ears; his soul, if soul he has, more'affected, more reached, if we may be allowed the expression, than it has ever been before; his mind filled with fantastic terrors. While in the room directly underneath, the champagne corks whizz merrily, and young men and maidens are gay and guilty. And far above them the bright stars in the still blue sky are shining purely, And above the stars shines God! It is a strange scene-strange to us, who merely record it I How much more astonishing must- it have appeared to Henry Hericot himself, an actog in it I But he soon recovered ,himself, partially, at least, and assuming as friendly and gay a tone as possible, said : "Come, Fanny, or DMary, or whatever name you will, have we not had enough of this? 'Curses can do no good. Be civil -and agreeable as you are beautiful. Come, do. I am very glad   jtRRljNG,  YET NOBLE       387 I have met you at last.

I forgive you your rather harsh welcome of me. Come, let us be friends once more-shall we not?" Iericot, though cowardly, must have been very impudent, in- deed, to make advances such as these in the face of all that has just occurred. But it often happens that the utmost impudence is combined with the ntmost cowardice. And it was thus in the present instance; But ihe calculated " without his host." Fanny Walters indignantly rejected his overtures. "Touch me not,'" she cried, as he endeavored to take her hand.   "Touch me not, or by the God above us, I  will killU you." She said the words, aye, and she -zeant them, too. Heri- cot, with all his impudence, would no more have dared to have touched  ler now than he -would have ventured into the den of a lioness. "Listen," she said. "Listen to me. I  hate you--I have told you so once--I repeat it-I hate you, I loathe you I A moment of woman's weakness did come to me, I  confess. But it is gone, and will not return. I have vowed to be revenged upon you. I lhave sworn to kill your body, as you have slain my soul. And yet you dare to talk of our being "friends " again.

Here she pauses a   moment; then resumes with the most . marked emphasis :  "But, mark my words. As surely as you will one day reach a hell, so surely will this hand of mine send you t  here before your time, if yovu live as yon have lived. If you do unto other women hereafter, as in the past you have done unto me, and it comes to my knowledge, woe upon you.

I have sworn my oath," she said, rising. So, if you value your life, take heed to your morals. a And now go--depart," she cried, waving her hand impe- riously. "I will watch you, but never see me-more. Never visit this house again. Go, you once deserted me ; I now order you to quit my presence. Be wise, and beware I Depart-fare- well-and see that it be forever!"  She opened the door, and fairly pushed the amazed Hericot out of the apartment. The door was bolted behind him. And the strange interview was over.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         389 CHAPTER IV. THE SKY BECOMES CLOUDY. LET US now return to our heroine, Julia Witherson, whom we left perfectly happy. She was re-united to the man she loved. His mother, so long and so bitterly opposed to her, now received her alliance on the most honorable terms. What more had she to wish for? Charles recovered his health rapidly. Ah! there is no physi- cian like a happy heart I Wre may prate as we please of homeo- pathy, and allopathy, and hydropathy ; but the best system of all for cures is joy-pathy! And midst the benign influence of Julia's smiles our wounded soldier-lover soon waxed strong. He returned to New York, resigned his commission, and devoted himself solely to his mistress, his mother, his love, and his bliss. As Julia was wealthy, and as she insisted that all that was hers was her lover's, our hero no longer had the fear of poverty before his eyes. So that the sky of our fortunate pair seemed cloud- less. One day, particularly, Julia was, indeed, most happy. She had passed the morning with Charles' mother--the ladies being engaged in that delicious, but costly feminine amusement, 'd shop- ping."  An amusement, by-the-by, the love of which, like the love of dress, seems implanted by nature in the bosom of every female that is born into this world. During their purchases, Charles had joined them, and the trio were as merry as three grown-up people could well be without attracting the particular attention of the public or the police. Having completed their purchases, they wended their way homeward.  But Julia, lhaving some little "private business" to transact, immediately afterwards started out alone to visit some   390        ERRING, 1YET NOBLE. of her poor proteges. This charity was the private business to which she alluded ; for Julia was not one who, when happy her- self, forgot those in affliction. And as she walked on her errands of benevolence her whole soul poured itself secretly in praise to Him, the Author of all good-the sender of her present perfect bliss. She wondered if any woman who had ever lived had been as blest as she felt now ; she wondered if ever woman had loved and been loved like her ; she felt that all the sorrows, shames, and struggles of the past were naught when compared with the joy of the present, and the anticipations of the future. She acknowledged to herself that she was utterly unworthy of the good fortune she was now re- ceiving; but she vowed silently, but solemnly, to strive to ren- der herself worthy of it hereafter. And her heart fairly bounded with gratitude and love to Charles, to Charles' mother, and to heaven. But as the very darkest hour is often just before dawn, so it sometimes happens that the brightest heart-day suddenly changes into a dreary midnight of the soul. At once, in a moment, we are hurled from pleasure into torture, from hope into despair. And thus with Julia. Her agonies were not yet over. More suffering was needed to develope the noble qualities, if not of herself, of her lover. Every step which Julia was now taking along the cheerful-looking streets was carrying her on toward a sad, startling discovery. But, to explain, we must take a glance backwards for a mo- ment., Some months ago, Julia, while making some purchases in a store--which she patronized liberally because she liked the pro- prietress personally,--noticed some very fine specimens of fancy needle-work exhibited in the window. On instituting some in- quiries in regard to them, the shopkeeper informed our heroine that they were the work of a young girl whose acquaintance she had recently made, and whose principal characteristic was sor- row. That is, she seemed more remarkable for real or affected grief and melancholy, than for aught else. Her sadness seemed   ERRING, YET rSOBLE.         391 to be independent of pecuniary or physical causes ; to be, in short, a sorrow of the mind. The only thing sloe cared for, in the way of anamusement, was embroidery and fancy needle-work generally. She possessed great aptitude for these pursuits, as was evident from the samples in t]he window, and was a neat, quiet, aud quite pretty young woman. This description interested our heroine, and procuring the nanme and residence of this person from the shopkeeper, she paid her a- visit, giving, as a pretext, her desire to obtain some specimens of needle-work. Julia found the statements of the shopkeeper to be correct. The girl was decidedly pretty, of the mild and meek order of beauty, and, though in very humble circumstances and in failing health, seemed to be contented with the one, and resigned to the other. But, still beyond all this, there seemed to be a deep sadness, which darkened her countenance and possessed her soul; a sadness which Julia found, in the course of several visits whch she paid, to be beyond her cure-a sadness of the soul, arisial from some mysterious cause. The girl, whose name was Hetty Thorpe, interested our hero- ine more and more, and, as the two became intimate,- Julia en- deavored cunningly, though, of course, delicately, to fathom the depths of her new proteg"s secret. But to no purpose. Though communicative enough on most subjects, though unreserved in ler expressions on all other points, Hetty, whenever her own sorrows were the theme, was as silent as the grave. As a neces sary consequencc, our heroine became still more interested in Hetty Thorpe, and still more determined to penetrate her secret, so that she might relieve it. Passing in Hetty's neighborhood to-day, Julia determined to call upon her. The girl resided in C--- Court, a quiet, retired, and rather respectable little street, inhabited mostly by poor, but decent people. On reaching the house in which she resided, our heroine found her humble friend in tears-weeping bitterly. The strange interest which Julia felt in this sad creature, now deepened at this unusual display of suffering, and she endeavored,   392        ERRING, YET S2OBLE. by all the means in her power, to soothe the mysteriously-weep. ing Hetty. But in vain. "I shall never be happy on this earth any more," said the girl,-" never, never, never." "And wherefore not?" asked Julia. "What have you to render you so wretched? Is your health worse than usual? "Oh, no, I shall live out my time, I suppose, and I do not suffer much." "Aie you in want of any assistance?" inquired her visitor. "Oh, no, I can earn by my needle all that I need," was the reply. "Tell me, then, Hetty, do tell me what ails you,' said Julia earnestly. "I have cherished a warm regard for you, you -know I have." "Yes, Madam, you have been a kind patron to me," inter- rupted the girl. "Nay, do not call me ' Madam,'" cried our generous un- aristocratic heroine. "Call me Julia, just as I call you Hetty, and do not consider me as a patron, but as a friend, as a sister." "Sister," reiterated Hetty. "Sister. Ob! if I had only had a sister or a brother, I would not be what I now am.'? Here was a discovery, at least more than Julia had been able to discover before. Hetty Thorpe was sisterless and brotherless.  Julia's heart warmed yet more towards the lonely girl. "Oh, be frank," she cried, " be fiank with me, and tell me what your secret is; your secret that makes you so unhappy Believe me, I can aid you. Even if I cannot, your very con- fession to me, and my friendly sympathy, will make you less sorrowful."  "My confession I Who toldyou that I have anything to confess?" asked the girl rather sharply. "I know that you have some   secret grief; the cause of which I fain would know.  I feel an -extraordinary, an unac-   ERRBXO, YET NOBLE.       393 countable interest in you, Hetty. Again I say that I may be able to relieve you.' Again I tell you that I would be your friend, your sister. Will you not confide in me?" Julia plead as earnestly as though she were entreating some great personal boon of her companion. Ah I how fool- ish we mortals are. - Had Julia been wise she would never have sought to penetrate into Hetty's secret. She would' have avoided Hetty as a pestilence; she would have desired to remain in perpetual and total ignorance of her existence. "Where ignorance is bliss," etc. But, alas! Julia With- erson was not wise. A new idea, to-day, took possession of Hetty Thorpe. Though she had determined never to confess her secret to any one ; though she had determined to bear it in her own bosom unrevealed till the day of judgment; yet there are certain moments in which we suddenly, on some strange im- pulse, break the carefully reasoned resolve of years. There are persons, moved towards whom, in some inexplicable man- ner, in whose favor we violate all our strongest resolutions. The present to Hetty was one of those moments; Julia was one of those persons. The girl knew that her confess sion must be a painful one of shame; that her visitor could do nothing for her ; yet she had taken so strange a fancy to Julia ; Julia entreated so earnestly for her confidence; poor Hetty so longed to communicate her sorrows to at least one human heart (even though in communicating her sorrows she also revealed her shame) ; above all; the strange, wild influ. ence of the moment was so strong upon her, that, spite of reason and determination, she confessed all. And what a confession it was I The hearing of it formed one of the crises in the life of Julia Witherson. It was an epoch in her existence. She had entered the room occupied by Hetty Thorpe, radiant with happiness; her eyes sparkling with the light of a happy soul. She now stood in that room (that little, humble, though neat apartment, whose only adorn- ments were specimens of needle work) with her eye-light   394        ERRINO, ET NOBLE. darkened and the joy of her soul departed. The confession of Hetty Thorpe had wrought this dire change in a few -minutes. Julia's desire was gratified; her curiosity was satisfied; she knew Hetty's secret, and much good did the knowledge do her. So much good that her heart almost ceased to beat, not with ecstacy but torture ; so much good that she offered up to heaven a prayer for mercy and for death. And yet the confession of Hetty Thorpe was not a remark- able one. It was, on the contrary, such a story as many a woman had narrated before her time, and will narrate, alas I until the end of time--a sad, shameful, but old and trite story of foolish love, guilty love, desertion, and unavailing regret.  t She had lived in her early youth near -- College, where a handsome student and his equally handsome, -though cor- rupt friend, made her acquaintance in a rather romantic manner. She liked the former, though she disliked the latter. The student became intimate with- her. She loved the student. He took advantage of her love, and, under the promise of marriage, seduced her. He then would, out of honor, have fulfilled his pledge, but she overheard his friend dissuading him from so doing, and laughing at him. She also overheard the student himself confess that it would injure his prospects greatly if he should marry her; and then she waited to hear no more. In a tumult of feeling, not knowing what she did, anxious only to hide her sorrow and her shame from those who had loved her in her pure childhood, believing that her case was hopeless, she had left her home, had lived in New York, sip- porting herself by her skill in the needle ; and she had never seen her betrayer since; but she knew his real name. It was Charles Singerly! Hetty Thorpe concluded her story with these words : "And oh I Miss Witherson, or rather ' friend,' 'sister,' if you will- allow such a wretch as I have now shown myself to claim your   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         895 promise," (a silent pressure of the hand was Julia's only answer) "it is the memory of my shame which makes and keeps me sad. What is-sickness or poverty compared to the everlasting recol- lection of my disgrace? Nothing but death can free me from my sorrow. Only one thing else-my marriage to Charles. My marriage to the man who promised to marry me, and who would have kept his promise had not his wicked friend, whom he called by the name of Henry, prevented him.- I love Charles yet, and I have sometimes thought that even now, though years have passed, were he alive and unmarried, and did he know how I, his early but willing victim, still loved him, and how, above all things I longed to redeem my honor by a marriage with him, he would still fulfil his promise." Reader, is it possible for any pen to do full justice to the emotions of Julia, as there, in that little room, lookingn out into the humble street, on that bright, beautiful day, she stood, listening to the confession of Hetty Thorpe? We think not. At least we can but briefly and imperfectly sketch the mental tumult in our poor heroine's soul. At first she was inclined to doubt the story she had just heard, or, rather, Charles' connection with it. But in vain she strove to doubt. Conviction was borne with irresistible weight upon her mind.  Hetty's description of the personal appearance both of the "student" and his "' friend," tallied exactly with Charles Singerly and Henry Hericot; the college, the date, the - particulars of the story, were all too accurate. Julia now re- membered that her betrothed lover once had the reputation of being very "fast ;" she also remembered various allusions which Charles had made' in his interviews with her to his having erred himself in youth with women, and she understood these allusions now. Yes, it was all too true. Charles himself, the noble, poet, Charles, her lover, her betrothed, the man she worshiped, was, after all, but a seducer. Seized with a sudden impulse, Julia took from its hiding-place, near her heart, a medallion likeness of her lover and held it to the gaze of her companion. Ah I   396        ERRIXG, YET NOBLE. there was no mistaking that look of recognition, tenderness, and astonishment; that look which overspread at once the face of Hetty, the'moment her eyes fell upon the miniature of Charles Singerly.- Yes, Julia felt that it was all too true, indeed I Hetty Thorpe was one of her lover's victims I "Ah, that is he!" cried Eetty, as she beheld the medallion. "You know him, then-is he alive?" "Yes," forced itself from the lips of Julia. "And is-is he-is he married?" "No." For the life of her Julia could not then have said another word. "Thank God!" cried her companion. "And then," she con- tinued, addressing Julia with an earnestness totally at variance with her wonted, dispirited manner, " you w'ill see him, will you not? You will tell him that I love him still; you will remind him that I have a claim upon his honor. You will tell him that I will die with shame and grief unless he fulfils his pledge. That I never have doubted his truth, but knew that he would have -done me right had it not been for his wicked friend. And that I will make him a good wife, and will never disgrace hitn. You will tell him all this, will you not? or will you bring ma to him?1" Realize, reader, our heroine's position. Asked to beg her own betrothed lover to marry another ; and asked, too, by one, alas I who had a right. Imagine, then, oh reader, if you can, our heroine's feelings I She replied to her companion's entreaties coldly,- hiding fire by ice : "You ask me to sayv strange things ; things veryv strange to be said by a woman to a man." But a new idea occurred to Hetty. A light broke in upon her. She turned to her visitdr and said, "But perhaps you will not do this. You will- not tell him what I wish. Perhaps you love him yourself?" Twenty-four hours ago, nay, two heours ago, Julia Witherson would have acknowledged her love for Charles Singerly in the face of heaven and earth, acknowledged it proudly, gladly asserted 'her claim to his heart, in the hearing of assembled   ER1rTG, YET NOBLE.         397 thousands I But now-she might still love him-she could hardly tell how she felt towards him, but, at any rate, she could no longer assert confidently her affection. Another had now a right to challenge it ; and so she replied, evasively : "I am but a friend of Mr. Singerly's." "Will you tell him of me--will you bring him to me?" asked Hetty, earnestly. Poor Julia! Whatever else might or might not- happen, she felt convinced that, at least, Charles must be informed of to-day's discovery, he must know of Hetty Thorpe's- existence, he must see her. And so she promised to comply with her companion's- request. And shortly afterwards our heroine departed from the house- in which she had learned so fatal a secret. Had a man stood at this time near C--  court, he would have seen a tall, stately young lady issue forth from one of the houses, traverse the court, lower her veil, and bend her rapid steps towards the more crowded streets, and, mingling with the throng, pursue her way-while the sun shone brightly, and the streets -were full of bustle. All this would be an every day affair. But if this man were to be told that this lady was sufferingo in her heart the tortures of love, despair, and various other contend- ing emotions; if he were to be told that this ladylike, rapidly- moving, well-dressed female figure, who attracted no particular attention, was as wretched a being as walked the earth ; that in her breast a tragedy was being performed that far surpassed inl thrilling sorrow the most sensational French melodrama ; had he been told all this, the man would have wondered greatly. And yet he would have been told but the simple truth; for the female figure was Julia Witherson. Ah! reader, our greatest tragedies are not always presented in the dramatic form ; or, at least, the stage is not the only place where dramas are enacted. Horrible melodramas often take place unnoticed in the street; and ofttimes their theatre is the human heart   3-98        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Julia's soul was in a whirl. At one moment she sharply con demned her lover, and the image of Charles Singerly as a betrayer and a liar rose up terribly before her. He was unworthy her love; wherein did he differ from Henry Hericot after all? But at another moment, her loving heart found many an excuse-or, at least, palliative-for Charles' conduct. He had erred when he was very young--a mere boy. Doubt- less, his " friend, "--his evil angel as well as her own' Herieot, had led him on. Doubtless, Charles would have fulfilled his pledge to his victim had not Hericot dissuaded him. Perhaps, spite of all, Charles would have done so if Hetty had not fled beyond his reach--who knows?  At any rate, Julia doubted not that her lover had long ago sincerely repented of his early sin ; and what was she, herself, that she should blame him? No; she forgave him. Aye, and she loved him still-loved him as dearly as ever. She knew this by the pang that thrilled her being, penetrated her every part, at the bare thought of renouncing him, of yielding him to another. ' But why should I give him up?" she mentally cried,--" why should I surrender my claim to him? Why tell him of the ex- istence of Hetty Thorpe? Why inform him that his victim lives; and not only lives, but loves him still-and desires to become his wife? Why,- truly 2 His wife I that should be my title ; my claim to that is paramount. I have worked for it ; prayed for it; confessed for it; endured shame and sorrow for it--my right to it is supreme. Why need he know of her existence?   I am not forced to tell. Other men have committed' early indiscretions' and riot had their whole lives blasted by it I Why should he and I be more ill-fated in this respect than others? Perhaps, after all, she is but an impostor-or more to be blamed than pitied. Or, at best, she, and he, and I have all three sinned. Now, as there must be some suffering, why not one suffer rather than two?   Why not- she alone rather than Clharles and I? Why shall not we marry and be happy?  Oh! I cannot yield him up. I cannot see him taken from me for ever; just at the' moment, too, when we are to be supremely blest I I cannot, by   EERRING, YET NOBLE.        399 my own act and tongue, destroy my own life-happiness. I can- not do this. Oh, God I it is- too much, too much. I have al- ready done all that woman cam do, borne all that woman can bear; but this is too much for humanity." So it is, dear Julia I But there is such a thing as nobility of soul ; such a thingr as the Grace of God, and nothing is "too much" for that., And this G-race changed the current of Julia's ' thoughts.- "' Heaven forgive me," she cries, in the depths of her soul,- "what am I about to do? To dishonor my promise? To vio- late my word? To deprive a poor injured woman of her chiefest wish, of her dearest right? To undertake a dishonest conceal- ment? And all for what? For my own selfish gratification I No; I have not the best right to be called his ' wife.' She has the stronger and the prior claim. What other men have or have not done, what other women in my place would or would not do, is no rule for me. I must walk inthe path of honor and of con- science; and this path leads me to-to the informing him of all -all that I have this day learned, and promised to reveal. She is no impostor. I cannot cheat myself with such pretence. She is the woman who, at all hazards of suffering to himself or my- self, has the sole right to be his wife. I must tell him of Hetty Thorpe. And what I must do, I can do. I must do my duty if I break my heart. Yes; I will fell him to-night al." By this time she had reached the door of her uncle's residence -her home. She entered and proceeded quietly to her own room. She reached the apartment, locked the door-and was alone with her thoughts. She had just formed a determination, on motives of princi- ple, which, by her own act, would probably wreck her own earthly happiness. She had just determined to plead the cause of a rival with the man she loved. How Charles himn self would look upon the matter, how he would act when he heard of her discovery, she knew not, she could only surmise. How he ought to act she knew ; and this line of duty severed him from herself for ever.  .   400        ERRING, YET NOBLE=. She was alone; -the unnatural calm of her manner depart- ed; she threw herself in utter abandonment of spirit upon the bed. It was a lovely day; she cared not for it. ,Her bird, in its gilded cage by the window,o sang, oh, how deli- ciously I But she heard it not. There she lay upon her sumptuous couch, in her gorgeous room, utterly wretchlled. "Oh, my God 1" she .cried, starting up wildly, " my grief is greater than I can bear." But at this moment her dis- tracted glance fell upon a fine painting of "Christ in the Garden." A look upon the Divine patience of the face, a sight of the meekness in those Godlike eyes, and the wild fury, of her sorrow departed. She murmured, "not my will but thine be done." And her soul was strengthened. She felt that it was best that she should tell Charles all; for otherwise she would herself never be happy in mind, but would always be haunted by the recollection of Hetty Thorpe ; besides Hetty might, probably now would, discover Charles for herself; and if he did not hear the story from one he would hear it from the other. It was hard, oh, so hard I But she repined not. She waited for evening to bring him to her, and the she would tell him all. It was the noblest time of Julia's noble life. She had, indeed, been made " perfect through suffering." And there she remained. She thought but of three things : her duty, her once lover, and the fast-approaching evening. ,                       .   ERRI-O, YET NOBLE.        401 CHAPTER V. EARLY SIN BRINGS A LATE REPENTANCE. Bur fate has its own peculiar way of doing things; and in this case fate so managed it that on the very afternoon during which Julia sat in her room, awaiting the approach of dreaded evening, she received a hurried note from her lover, stating that he was obliged to go out of town at once on a pressing affair of business, and would not return till the next day; but that on to-morrow evening he would call upon her as usual. The note concluded with a line or two of love's extravagance and tender endearment. 'On the receipt of this note our heroine scarcely knew whether to be pleased or vexed with the delay. One thing, however, she did do; she kissed the note many, many times, especially the concluding words, Yours for ever,    CHARLES. She looked upon the letter fondly, as one would gaze upon a relic, for it might be the last letter she would ever receive from  Charles Sinrgerly. He calls himself "mine for ever." She murmured, "alas I for ever may mean scarce twenty- four hours more." And she hid the letter in her bosom. The next day was a rainy and a very disagreeable one, and Charles returned to town about twelve in the morn- ing; and having  some further business to transact in the city, he traversed the streets oif foot, to and fro, attended only by that constant companion of civilization in a rain--an umbrella. A  city during a storm, or rather during a " drizzle," is one of the most disagreeable, unpicturesque and undramatic objects in creation. The streets are mud and slush, mingled   402        ERRING, YET NOBLE. with stones; the sidewalks are as damp as graveyards; the closed windows of the houses give an air of additional gloom to the surroundings; the deserted shops seem mourning over their departed customers; and the few people one meets seem -as mournful as ghosts at a funer al. Occasionally an omnibus rushes past, the poor driver drip- ping with rain, a human Niagara, and the poor horses, mo're than satisfied, apparently, with their involuntary shower-bath. But even this omnibus does not give you a pleasant idea, it merely serves to add a harsh noise to a cheerless scene, nothing more. All the men you encounter seem cross, in fact are cross ; and all the women look ug'ly. Occasionally at the corner of a stree a group are gathered under shelter of some friendly awning, and a laugh- may be heard; but it does not sound hearty or genuine, this laubgh; it sounds rather as though its perpetrator were endeavoring to proceed on the Mark Tapley principle, and was determined to be "jolly," not because he really felt so, but because he conceived it to be his duty under the circumstances. And then it is decidedly uncomfortable to be carrying around with you constantly, holding it carefully over your person, at the cost of a tired arm, a huge umbrella, such as it was Charles Singerly's lot to carry this morning. Find. ing it raining on his return to town, and being unprovided with an umbrella (having left his fine silk one at home), he had borrowed a large cotton affair from one of his business friends, and was now proceeding on his various errands, holding over himself a tremendous, ungainly, and very heavy circular awning, which would have delighted the eyes of a whole family during the deluge. Now, dear reader, we ask you candidly, what- can be more wnromantic and undramatic than a man, going from office to office, on matters of money and business, on a rainy, dis- agreeable, " dirty" day, carrying over him a common ugly, huge, cotton umbrella? We ask you what can there be startling or dramatic in the meeting between a man and a   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        403 woman on a rainy day, in the street, both of them carrying umbrellas? And yet,'dear reader, tragedies, or rather romantic and startling dramas, occasionally, will take place under just such unpoetical and unromantic circumstances as these. Thus, upon this very day of which we write, Mr. Charles Singerly, being on his way to fulfil his last business errand, and walking rapidly to fulfil it, and then go home, suddenly finds his umbrella in collision with that of another pedestrian, a young woman. He apologizes for " his carelessness," and is about to pass on when he is startled by a slight scream, proceeding evidently from the aforesaid- young female. He casts a hasty, curious look upon her. She has recog- nized him I She calls'him by his name of "Charles!" He feels that he has heard that voice before, not of late years, but long ago certainly. And that face, too. It is somewhat altered, yet very familiar! Where can he have seen that face? Ahl, he remembers all now. Like a flash from the skies the memory darts through him. -He recollects now but too well whose voice, whose face it is; he knows now where he last heard the one, and where he last saw the other. The face and the voice belong to a woman to whom lie once paid court, whose love he won and abused; a woman of whom he has thought for years, remorsefully and regretfully; whom, however, he has recently forgotten in the glory of another and a mightier love; a woman whom he has thought was' dead, but who now stands there on the sidewalk alive beside him. And thus, and there, and then carrying umbrellas and bun- dles in the damp, dreary, public street, on that rainy day; for the first time for years, Charles Singerly and Hetty Thorpe meet  Two or three persons, yathered under a neighboring awn- ing, noticed the meeting just described. They saw nothing   404     3.RRING, YET NOBLE. outwardly very remarkable. Two persons, a man and a woman, encountered each other, recognized each other, spoke, shook hands, and -then the man joined the woman and they walked rapidly away together. There was nothing very startling or romantic in this I But could these spectators have pierced through the breasts of this man and this woman: could they have seen the hearts of Charles and Hetty ; could they have beheld the emotions there conflicting, they would have realized that truth is stronger than fiction. Charles accompanied his new-found victim to her humble home. But little was said on the way, for the souls of both were too full for their lips to speak. Charles, especially, felt like a man in a dream. His emotions were in a whirl. He knew not what he did. They reached C-- court, the quiet little street where Hetty lived. They turned down the court; they reached the door of Hetty's home ; they entered the house. They were alone ; alone in Hetty's little parlor, where she keprt all her choicest specimens of needle-work. "Oh, I am so glad I have met you at last i" she cried. "I have been looking for you so long i" P' Looking for me so long 1" repeated Charles. ' I had given you up as dead 1" N "No, not dead, thank God Hat least not yet. But I could not bear to live at home, amongst my own people in shame, Charles. I overheard your wicked friend, one day, advising you not to keep your promise to me,.your promise to marry me; you remember-THAT, don't you?" "Yes," said Charles, simply. It was all he could say. Good God I he did indeed remember. "I was afraid you would take his advice, and would not keep your faith with poor me!" she continued, " and so I left home in haste, and have never seen or heard from my aunt or unele, with whom I lived, since. They think me dead, I hope. I came' to New York to seek you. I feared that I had done you wrong, that I had been foolish; that had I. not left home, but waited   ERRING) YET NOBLES         40  and seen you once more, you would not have followed your friend's bad counsel, but would have kept your promise to me, and made me your'wife. I knew that you were noit a wicked, but a noble man--my heart told me so. And my heart also told me, ' Seek for him. Find him. He will keep his pledge to you yet.' And I have found you at last. Oh, Charles, think not meanly of me for the confession, but I love you still. See, what I have done.' So saying, she put her hand beneath the bosom of her dress and drew from thence a delicate, fine, lace handkerchief of the smallest size, but most exquisite workmlan- ship. "You remember this, do you not?" she said. "'Tis the one you gave me. I have worn it next to my heart ever since. And see-I have embroidered your name and mine together in this corner. It cost me several days just to embroider those few letters." And, to tell the truth, the work was most magnificent-one of the finest and most fanciful possible specimens of needle-work. Charles remembered   the handkerchief well. Still he said nothing. But, not taking any note- of his silence, she con- tinued : "Charles-dear Charles--now, that I have found you, you will keep your promise to me, will you not? It is years -since you gave the promise, it is true. But what of that? The re- membrance of what you have made me will last all my life. Surely your faith with me ought to last that long also. Oh, if you did but know how I have hoped and yearned to be some day your wife.  I feel that I can never regain my lost honor until I stand beside the altar with you. I dare not die, or think of dying, until that time comes. It is only as your wife that I can lift up my eyes and look those around me in the face without shame.  It is only thus that I can forget my sorrow that is kill. ing me.  It is only as your wife that I dare to pray. To marry you, and to wipe away by marriage my early sin; this has been ,for years, by day and by night, my wish, my hope, my life itself. Oh I I will make you a good wife, believe me, Charles. I will love you and serve you, as never woman loved and served hus- . '   406        ERRING, YET NOBLE. band before. I will, at least, try not to disgrace you, Charles. Poor girl, as I am, I have endeavored, for years, to make myself as worthy as I can to be your wife. You will keep your word, then, Charles-will you not? The word you gave me when I gave you all " ... She pled as earnestly to the man, Charles Singerly, to marry him, as ever man had plead to woman to be allowed to marry her. Her whole soul was in her petition. Gentle in all things- else, in this point she was fire itself. And how imagine you felt Charles, as she thus addressed him and implored him? Let our lady-readers think a while, and answer. This passionate love for, his plighted troth to, Julia on the one hand; and the startling. glimpse of his duty to Hetty Thorpe, upon the other. Still he said nothing. She noticed now his silence. ,!You do not speak. Surely von cannot mean to play, me false, to break your faith with me when I placed all my faith in you? But-ah! perhaps she was mistaken-or did not tell mb truth when she said you were not married--or that she was merely your friend. Yes-she must have deceived me." "She-who?V asked Charles, hi wonder. "The lady who has been so kind to me, and to whom I have confided my sorrow. Ah! how ungrateful I am. She never could have deceived me." "But who is this 'she,' whom you say has spoken to you of me?" inquired Charles. "Ah, perhaps I should not tell you," was the reply. "But I have a right to know," continued her companion. "She is a good, kind young lady, who has been a benefactress to me. She is stately to look at. She seems like a queen ; but she is not at all proud. Oh, no-so mild and so generous." "And you say she spoke to you of me; you say -she knows me?" interrogated Charles. "Oh, yes," cried. Hetty ; and then added hastily, perhaps inu cautiously,-" she carries your likeness with her." "My likeness with herl" cried Charles ; and then he exclaimed, a sudden and horrible suspicion suggesting itself to his mind;   "    . ERRING), YET NOBLE.        407 Heaven's I can it be?   No--and yet----  Tell me her 1name." "Her name-is lMiss Witherson, Miss Julia Witherson," was the reply. Yes; his suspicion was true ; and Julia, his adored Julia, by a most strange chance, had heard of his infamy. He fell back like one startled ; like one who was in mortal fear. "You are ill," cried Hetty Thorpe. "Oil, no," he murmured. "Then it must be this woman," said his companion. "What can she be to you?" "No matter what!" he cried.. The hope had occurred to him that perhaps after all Julia had not learned the full story of his guilt. 9"What did you tell her of me?" he inquired, eagerly. "Does she-know that Hthat H-"   He paused, scarcely knowing how to phrase the question, though the reader can imagine what he intended it to be. ' She knows all-all my story, and your connection with it. I told her all before I was aware that she was acquainted with you." "You told her, then, that Hthat I  "Again he faltered. "I told her we had erred. But I also told her that I believed in your honor, nevertheless ; I told her that I knew you would not have trifled with your promise to me had it not been for your friend." "She knows then that I promised to marry you!" "Yes." "Oh, God!" he cried. It was not blasphemy, reader, his use of those two words. It was merely the natural exclamation of the stricken heart. Whenever the human creature encounters one-of the crises of emotion which, in the path of life, must occasionally be met, he or she instinctively cry out " Oh, God!" , "It is all over," groaned Charles. "My  sin has found me out. She, nmy Julia; knows of my guilt. Our dreams are dreamed out now. I cannot bear this agony."   O8        EERING, YET NOBLE. "Stay,' cried Hetty, rising, as she saw her compnion ladvance hastily towards the door,---" yo will not leave me qow? "tOh, I want air. I will stie if Iremain.

He felt agony, it is true; but he scarcely was aware how mncuc. At last, in the midst of the pelting, dreary rain, Charles Singerly reached home. He still retained -the fine old house in which his father had lived, and his own boyhood had been spent; and, on reaching it, he immediately retired to his "study," and locked the door. This " study" was the same room in which years ago he had wept bitter though manly tears at what he then deemed was his final separation from Julia. And now he felt as though he could weep again. For was he not again separated from her?  Did she not know of his baseness? Did she not know that he was under a promise of marriage to another? Did she not think him dishonorable and treacherous? " No, he mentally cried, "she makes allowance for me doubtless. She treats my error as I have treated hers. If she knows all the circumstances she will not think so evil of me. But perhaps she does inot know all. Then I shall tell her. "Come what else will, she -shall, at least, hear my own story from my own lips, and shall not blame me more than I deserve. But even if she will pardon my error, will she love me still? Yes, yes; I feel it in my heart she will. But will she marry me? Will she consent to be my wife, know- ing that years ago I pledged myself to marry another, and that this other, now holds me to my pledge? Oh, God I this is the question. How shall I answer it? And what am I to do?  What should I do? What shall I do? Julia and I, how we have loved each other; how we do love, and ever shall 1 She has a claim upon me. All my hopes, my joys, all center upon her. I have a duty to perform, the duty to love h er and reward her love. Her best good and mine depend upon our union.

Must what is and what may be 18   "O       ERRING) XA mE T "v yield to the phantom of what has been? o, never. Letall else be as it may, whatever we may have been, whatever we mav have done, we love, are fitted for, and are betrothed to each other*' All else must yield to this. No,Inever will give thee up, oh, Julia!" And he rose from the seat into which he had thrown him- self, and paced his luxuriously-furnished study to and fro. v There, on all sides of him were arranged on their proper shelves the works of dead and living authors. But the liv- ing, agitated human being, who owned them all and had studied them all, heeded them not. What are authors or books to human souls in strong emotion? "No, Julia," he cried, unconsciously aloud, " we will never yield each other up I We will never suffer aught on earlh but death to part us p What claim after all has Hetty Thorpe upon me? I would have redeemed my ill-starred promise to her. I strove to find her in order to fulfil it, but she fled from me. I thought her dead. I had every reason to think her so; and now she comes, as it were, from the graveto blast me. But what of that? I have made other and holier pledges sicce. lly old promise (forfeited by her own act, her voluntary disappearance for years) is no longer binding I do not love her; I cannot love her; I love another; we are not suited to each other socially, intellectually, or in any other manner. I have no right to render Julia and myself wretched for life to gratify an unreasonable claim of Hetty Thorpe. It is asking too much of human nature. What have I done more than most young men? Nothing. All men have erred with women at least once in theirlives. But few have repented as I have. Why should I then be pun- ished more than others? Why, truly?" And Charles Singerly paused as though expecting a reply; but no sound was audible save the ceaseless pattering of the rain upon the roof of the piazza that was located directly back of the study. It is a dreary sound, that of the falling raindrops; they have a mournful undertone that fills the   heart with sadness., It speaks of desolation. Still it can scarcely be considered as a definite answer to a definite ques- tion; and Charles Singerly, therefore, may be said to have received no reply to his just-recorded inquiry. But, nevertheless, he did receive a reply, for his own con- science answered him; his own honor replied to him. These told him, that disguise the matter as he might, the simple truth was that he had betrayed a girl under promise of mar- riage; that now the poor creature claimed the only repar- ation in his power; and that Hetty Thorpe's claim to his hand, if not his heart, was paramount over all others. These told him that he was more than ever bound to fulfil his promise to Hetty, seeing how she still loved him, and how she longed for marriage with him as her only chance for happiness, repentance, aye, even salvation. These told him that his duty, his sacred duty, his feelings as a man, his honor as a gentleman, led him to keep faith with Hetty Thorpe, and that he could not be happy even with Julia Witherson, did he violate his duty to her unfortunate rival. Lastly, these told him, judging her by their own standard, that Julia herself would refuse to marry him under the cir- cumstances, deeming that Charles' hand was no longer her property. His own honor and his own conscience spoke thus to Charles Singerly; and he was obliged, in his own despite, to listen ; he felt in his inmost soul that their voices uttered the truth; and yet these truth-telling voices nearly drove him mad. Where were now his hopes of future-bliss-with Julia? Gone for ever. Gone with Julia's self. For she was no longer his. He was no longer hers. They were parted for ever, parted by a promise and a sin-an old promise and a youthful sin. How Singerly wrestled and struggled with himself for hours in his study I unseen but by Him in heaven; sur- rounded by naught 'but books and  papers, poems and philosophies, and histories and manuscripts; with no sound   "2        ERRmn , YET 4tOBLE. to disturb him, -save the ceaseless patter of the mournful rain. "' There are no battles on the earth So awful in their woe and worth As battles of the soul." And how did this battle terminate? To what resolution did Charles Singerly arrive? We will tell you. He was Ltnlable to decide. Arguments and feelings led .him -to Julia; strong arguments and a certain share of feeling inclined him to Hetty Thorpe. So he resolved to cut if he could not untie the Gordian knot, or rather to have it cut by another. - He resolved to leave the decision to Julia herself. Yes; he would go to her at once-; he would tell his story to her ; confess all its evil ; but, also, point out its brighter aspects. He would state his views to her ; his arguments and feelings on both sides. He would'ascertain what her views were on the mat- ter ; and then he would leave her to decide whether to accept or to discard him ; whether to blame or to forgive him ; whether he should fulfil his pledges to her, or his long-ago promise to another. This may seem a remarkable resolution-a shifting of the re- sponsibility ; perhaps it was. We only know that so it was. Charles Singerly left his study, in which he had now battled with himself for many hours, and noticing, for the first time, the damp condition of his garments, he went to his dressing-room and changed them. He then came down stairs, and partook of a hasty dinner. But, though his soul was on fire, he had now regained his self- command; and when he kissed his mother "good-bye" after dinner, he looked into her loving face with a smile. "Ah  I see, Charlie," said Mrs. Singerly, "that you are a faithful lover. Rain cannot damp your ardor." "Why. should it, mother?" "That's right, my boy. Your father, when he was courting me, Charlie, long years ago, never heeded the weather. In faqt, he took advantage of a rainy night to remain in my company longer than usual. Now-there is a hint for you to improve   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        413 upon to-night. Give Julia my love ; tell her to call and see me to-morrow. God bless you, my son, and may you have, in time, a child who will be to you all the comfort that you have been to me." "All will be well with me yet," tlought Charles. "I cannot be cursed when I have such a mother's blessing." And, with this thought, he walked through the rain to. the residence of Julia--the woman who now had, by hisown act, his fate in her hands. It was a singular situation. He was to marry one of two wo- men, as he was under promise to both; but he knew not, as yet, which. And now he was going to the house of one of these wo. men to ask her whether he should marry her or the other. m,   ;14        ERRING, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER VI. A STRANGE IDEA. EVENING was approachng, not with all its wonted paraphana. lia of gorgeous sunset, pensive twilight, and the like; but with clouds and dreary rain. And Julia sat in the drawing-room of her uncle's home, awaiting her lover. She was dressed with her usual good taste, and looked mag- nificently; but her face was paler than its wont, and her eyes, to use a phrase of a French poet, were "anxious eyes." She dreaded the coming interview with Charles; yet she felt that it was inevitable.           e A ring was heard at the street-door ; it was his ring-she had learned to know it well by this time. Contrary to her usual custom, she did not answer it in person She could not summon strength, and so her lover was admitted by one of the servants of the establishment. A step was heard-his step; le entered the drawing-room, and stood before her. He was attired in his wonted elegance, and seemed, as ever, the polished gentleman. But his face, like the sky without, was clouded. The two gazed upon each other with ll-an eager, sorrowful, and tender look, which well expressed the feelings of their hearts: eager to learn each other's' views; sorrowful at the barrier which had risen between them; tender with all the memories of their past love. Charles spoke first. There are two ways of " breaking a mat- ter," or opening a subject of conversation. A brief, bold, direct way, which comes plainly to the point at once ; or a more round- about, delicate, indirect method, which suggests, and hints, and finesses. Both styles have their advantages ; but Charles Singer- ly, in the present instance, adopted the former plan.   v ERRING, YET NOBLE.       415 "You have seen Hetty Thorpe," le said,--" you know all." In utter surprise and wouder (for, of course, Julia had, as yet, not the slightest knowledge of Charles' meeting with his early victim), our heroine ga'sped, rather than answered, "Yes." "And you condemn me," continued Charles ; " you deem me base and heartless; you regard me as a common betrayer and liar," "Ob, no," she replied, earnestly ; "I have formed excuses for you, as you have, in times past, done for me. You were young  you were tempted. She, herself, told me that she knew yvou would have kept your promise to her had she not disappeared."' "You do me but justice Julia," said her lover. "But let me tell you my story in detail." He was, above eyerything else, anxious that she should be , '    informed of all the extenuating circumstances in connection with this unfortunate affair, that she;might think no more harshy of him than he deserved. Whether she determined to marry him, or to yield him to another, she sliould, at least, respect him and esteem him still. And so he told her the history of his relations with Hetty Thorpe. How he had met her during one of his college ram. bles, had taken a great fancy to her, which for a while he really mistook for love ; how, his moral and religious principles at that time being, like those of most young men, very lax, he had taken advantage of her attachment to him, thinking lightly of the mat- ter, not intending to do the girl any injury, and deeming the whole matter a mere romantic episode ; how the poor girl, after she had fallen, began to see things in a different light., and had begged him to marry her, and he, against his better judgment, it influenced by her solicitations and his own feelings, promised to do so. Henry Hericot, his most intimate college friend, who had also made the acquaintance of Hetty, and knew of Charles' intrigue with her and encouraged it, had vehemently dissuaded him from the idea of marrying her, representing to Charles forcibly all the worldly arguments against such a marriage. He, Charles, had resisted the arguments of his bzs    "6        ERRING, YET NOBLE. friend, and sincerely desirous to atone for the wrong wlich lie had done to the poor girl, and -which he now began to see in its true light, would have fulfilled his pledge to her, but she had departed; had disappeared from home, and was at last, after several months search, given up by her relatives ans dead. He himself had searched for her long and zealously, but ill vain. The memory of his conduct towards her had ever been one of his secret sorrows, and had completely changed his views and conduct in regard to women; notwithstanding all his dissipa-: tion, he had never " intrigued " since the days of Hetty Thorpc, this error being his first and his last offence.      2 Julia listened to this explanation with mingled emotions of sorrow and joy--sorrow that her lover had sinned ; joy that his sin was thus extenuated-that spite of his error, he had been, as ever, noble. The idea also darted now through her mind that it might have been the thought of his own early indiscretion which had made Charles so forbearing and forgiving to her own youth- ful error; and in this she guessed, as the reader knows, the truth. "And now, Julia," asked Charles, when he had concluded his story, " do you condemn me- as much as at first? Do you think me base, mean, treacherous? A libertine or a liar?" "Oh, no I oh, no P1 she replied. "I never deemed you these, dear Charles." - "Dear Charles!" She had become, of late, so accustomed to these words, that she now spoke them, as it were, almost mechanically. He was still " dear to her. He never could be otherwise. "But how did you meet with-with Miss Thorpe?" continued Julia. Charles told her. There wasta moment's silence, and then she spoke. "Miss Thorpe loves you still,"-she said, addressing her lover. "She expects that you will marry her." Julia, if shelhad been paid at that instant a million dollars, could not have added another word. f                        -   ERRINGS YET NOBLE.         41 "Oh, heaven!" thought Charles Singerly, "nmy sin h, found me out.  The folly of an hour, the faly of many year ago, now returns to curse me.   How  beautiful Jul is, and yet I must now run the risk, the -almost certainty, c losing her forever, because in a moment of mad infatu tion, I yielded to a boy's temptation. This is, indeed, jud ment." He was correct. It was, indeed, "judgment."   And con dentially, dear reader, let me tell you, these "judgments" almo inevitably overtake sin. For a while we may pluck, in oi youth, the rose of transgression; but in our older years, we w be forced to feel the thorn of retribution. Rapidly, earnestly, with all the eagerness and solemnity of oi who is speaking words which will decide his lot for life, Char] laid his case before Julia. He stated, and he endeavored to sta forcibly, fully, honestly, the claims which Hetty Thorpe just held upon him. He also, with all the unrivalled eloquence  love (which to the ears of those concerned, sounds sweets grander than the periods of Sheridan or Webster), displayed all their long array, the rights and claims of his listener upon ] hand alike and heart.

A having told all this, he cried: "And now, my Julia--let me call you thus, even if it be f the last time-I leave it for you to decide, finally and fully. rests with you to say whether my duties and obligations 'to y are greater or less than my obligations and my duties to her. cannot determine this point for myself.

As he spoke,/he gave her a glance at once piercing, entreat- ing, sad- and tender." And she looked so beautiful, so charming in her surprise at this most unexpected proposition-this leaving with her the responsibility of so grand a decision-that even as the words passed his lips, the mood of Charles changed. He felt it was impossible, on ally terms, to surrender the possession of so delicious, so superb a being. And kissing her, with almost frantic vehemence, he exclaimed:  "I will not, I cannot, yield you up. I have decided. Though a very ghost were to rise from the grave to sunder us, yet would I not part from thee. It would be murder. The murder of my heart and tline. No, no I Nothinrg past, nothintg present or to come, shall part us." In the excitement of the moment he threw his arms about her, and clasped her tightly, and oh, how tenderly to his breast I Never had he loved her- as he loved her now ; never had lie be- fore worshiped her as lie now adored her. - He kissed her ; he pressed her stately, tall, magnificent, and most graceful form, which now yielded to his ardor ; he called her every endcarinoig name which the vocabulary of love could furnish ; he used all the argument that passion could suggest; and Julia's whole being was, for a space, in a whirl of intoxication, delight, and indecision. She felt his -kisses; she heard his burning words; she was enveloped, as it were, in his clasp.--Why should she decide for him? Why should there be any decision? What was Hetty Thorpe to them? What was a past sin to a present love? They were lovers, and in each other's arms. .Who or what should sever them? Should the reality of such an affectionu as theirs be disturbed by a fantastic notion of honor? They could not live apart. Each was part of each.  To separate them were, indeed, but "murder," and so they should qnot be sepa. rated. And Julia's lips responded to her lover's; her beautiful arms wound themselves around his neck/; her head reposed upon his breast.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         419 There and thus they sat; while Hetty Thorpe was in her little bed-room in C--  court, looking out upon the rain, and pray. ing God to restore to her the man with whom  she had loved and erred. Julia was but lhuman. - Shewas tempted, and for a moment she yielded to the dear temptation. But her mood changed; her honor and her duty began to speak within her. She with- drew herself from her lover's embrace, and endeavored to restolre herself to calmness. He, Charles, had left it with her to decide whether, since the discovery of Hetty Thorpe, his heart (or at least his hand) was due to herself or to this Hetty. True, she could refuse to decide this question, ancT could replace the responsibility of answering it upon him. But, at any rate, she would have to be a party to this decision. There was much truth in Cllarles' 'statement of his position. There were strong arguments in favor of his aban- doning her and devoting himself to his former victim. There were almost equally cogent reasons for his remaining faithful to his love and pledges to herself and not heeding the demands of Hetty. How should she determine in such a case as this? It was a most peculiar position. A woman asked by her lover to decide whether his love was due to hlerself or to her rival I She sat in the elegant drawing-room, surrounded by all the luxuries of modern furniture and fashionable art, elegantly at- tired, yet most perplexed, most wretched ; her mind in a fever, utterly indescribable.

And over their heads, upon the roof which sheltered them, fell stead- ily and mournfully the dreary rain-,hile not far off, amidst   420        ERRINTG, YET NOBLE. tlhat wilderness of houses called a city, sat Hetty Thorpe at her lonely window, looking out upon the night, and thinking of the false idol of her youth. But suddenly, an idea, a novel, strange, yet a not utterly un- practicable idea, occurred to the mind of the agitated, perplexed Julia.  Charles had transferred to her the responsibility of a decision which of right rested with himself. Why should not she, in her turn, transfer this assumed responsibility of hers to the account of another? Charles had trusted his fate to the award of Julia. Why should not the -latter trust the fate of both to the decision of Hetty Thorpe herself?  Yes, this was the idea that occurred to our heroine. She considered its bearings and relations a moment. Slle reflected that she was unable herself to decide the question before her, relative to the duty of the man she loved under the peculiar circumstances by which he was surrounded. It was with her a case of conscience vers heart. But Hetty Thorpe was the one most interested ;- let her therefore decide. Perhaps she would be generous, and perform a greater feat than our heroine felt capa- ble of-decide against herself. Perchance, Hetty would take pity upon the lovers, and not insist upon her lately asserted ritlghts. At any rate, this plan would spare Julia one struggle. After all, it was a matter more of impulse and feeling than rea- soning. The idea rushed upon our heroine's mind, promising her a few hours delay, a change, a chance, and she adopted it almost at once-as eagerly as a drowning man catches even at a straw. She suggested the idea to Charles. He started in wonder, and then (it would be difficult to tell why, as is often the case with human actions) agreed to the proposal. Yes, he would call, with Julia, upon Hetty Thorpe at once-this very night. He would tell her all ; all his love for Julia, all Julia's love for hm, all the ties which bound them to each other. And then he would appeal to the woman whomphe had betrayed in favor of the woman to whom he was betrothed. And by the decision of the former he would be guided.  The crisis of their fate was at hand.  Let them approach it at once. Let them go seek it now,   ERRING, YET NOBLnr.       421 'UOfortunate couple I They loved, and were betrothed to each other; and yet they were now going to leave it to the decision of a third party whether their love-engagement should cease or continue. Charles knew that he must soon marry, yet he did not know whom -he should wed, and had no option in the matter. He knew whom he loved, but not whether it was lawful to love her. And the decision on these points rested with a woman who loved him, but whom he did not love, though he ought to do so. While Julia knew not whether in twenty-four liours she should be re-betrothed to the man she loved, or whether her betrothal should be ended, and even her love be made unlawful. It rested entirely with another woman to de- cide. And this woman the one who loved and had a prior claim upon the very man to whom she was betrothed. A delicate and peculiar situation truly! m ; ,   422       ERRING, YET NOBLE. CHAPTER      VII. "OVING ONE AND LOVED BY TWO. CHARLES and Julia, notwithstanding the rain, sally forth to visit Hetty Thorpe, Charles carefully protecting his com- panion from the shower. No mortal beholder, seeing them in so unromantic and matter-of-fact position, would imagine the tumults of their souls, or would guess at the wild super-romantic object of their expedition. So little do we mortals know of one another! They walk rapidly onward ; not a star looks down upon them from heaven. Even the lamps shed but a weak and melancholy light upon the streets of earth ; and their hearts are on fire with fear, hope, impatience, love, sorrow', and a world of other and mingrled emotions. They reach C  court; they knock at the door of the house in which Hetty Thorpe resides; and Hetty herself admits- them. She is surprised, as well she may be; but she greets Julia respectfully, gratefully, and smiles lovingly upon Charles. And Julia sees that smile, and it sends a jealous pang to her heart. They enter Hetty's little parlor, that cosy, humble little parlor, the only adornments of which are specimens of the occupant's exquisite needle-work, and they seat t llem- selves; and. then for a space there is an embarrassed silence. At last Charles opens the conversation by at once saying what he 11s come to say. He tells Hetty all his story as it concerns herself, and as it concerns Julia. He tells her that he sought for her vears ago to fulfil his pledge, but could not   ERPRING, ET NOBLE.        423 find lSr, and that now he has learned to love another, to whom he is also pledged. "I liked you," he says; "I really thought at first that I loved you, but I hlave since learned what love is; and ILknow now that I love you not. I She loves me; she to whom I arn betrothed loves me even more fondly than you. You cherish but a fancy, a memory; she has been a part of me for' years. Our happiness for life is centred in our union with each other; but I acknowledge your prior claim. In a moment of wild temptation we years ago both erred, amid I wronged you. This error, this-wrong led me to a promise of atonement, which I am now here to fulfil if you demand. I will be to you a true and kind husband, but I cannot be a loving one. My heart of hearts must be through life another's. Still you shill be my wife in the face of all the world. I am content so-so is Julia if needs be. Miselry is no argument against duty ; and now it is for you to decide my fate, our fate. Think not of us ; do what seems to you best for yourself ; we shall be satisfied with your decision whatever it may be; we shall not blame you even ill our most secret thoughts. You once sacrificed all for me. I am now prepared to sacrifice all, love itself, and her I love, and all' the happiness of life for you." Hetty Thorpe listened, and now came the time of her temp- tation. The great wish of her life was ripe for its fulfilment, its realization as it were, hung like a rich fruit within her grasp. Why should she not reach forth her hand and pluck it, and bring it to her bosom? Why not, truly? Why should she not marry Charles Singerly? Let them say what they would, she, Hetty Thorpe, loved him as truly as did Miss Julia Witherson ; and she lbad loved him much longer. She had adored Charles Sthgerly before Julia Witherson had even so much as met him. And if he loved her not now, why, then, he was false to his early pledge, and that was no fault of hers; and she would teach him in time to love her oncemore.   4" 24      ERRING, YET NOBLE. Her rights were indisputable. She had all the claifls of the loving and the wronoed. It was her duty to wed him. Repentance, atonement, virtue demanded it. The very peace of her present and all the joy of her future were centered in her union with him. Providence, most unexpectedly, after years of separation, had brought them together. Let her accept'the blessing of God. She, Hetty Thorpe, would make as good and as true a wife as would Julia Witherson, or any other woman on the earth. She could not live and see him another's. These and kindred thoughts flashed through the mind of Hetty as she listened to the words of Charles. And she smiled, partly in love, partly in bliss, and partly in triumph. There was silence for a moment; naught was to be heard but the beating of those three hearts, and the patter of the rain, and the ticking of a little clock which stood upon the mantle-piece. It was a strange and startling status. Two lovers wait- ing for -the fiat -which was to doom their love for ever; a fiat to be pronounced by a judge of their own appoint- ment-a judge, too, who was virtually interested in the matter. There could be no'doubt as to the sentence. Julia and Charles looked on Hetty, and then glanced sadly, despair- ingly upon each other; and then Hetty Thorpe said, "Charles, I cannot, will not yield you up. You are mine by right, and I will yet make you-mine by love. You shall yet " Here she suddenly paused. She was struck with the anguish, the anguish not to be concealed, impressed upon. the countenances of her visitors. It seemed to her a new revelation. - It spoke louder than any words. And her spirit was troubled. Her nobler nature contended with the selfish decision she had just expressed. She remembered, all at once, how kind, how very kind Miss Witherson had been to her. And. was she to requite her by rendering her miserable for life? She saw, she was forced to see, that Charles Sing- erly loved her not. And was she to accept a hand without a j   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        425 heart? She was compelled to acknowledge that our heroine was more fitted by birth, education and position to be the wife of Charles than she herself. She might be first, but Julia was most. Beside, Hetty was, though gentle, yet capable of a, high no- bility of thought and action (many "gentle" people are), and the noble voice in her soul said : "If Julia is willing to abandon love for honor, should not I be willing also? Shall she be more generous, more self-sacrificing, more truly loving than I? How can I be happy with him if I know that I am making both him and her wretched forever? Would it not be merely adding another sin to my number thus to separate those who love, and to wed one who loves me not? If he has learned to love another, whose fault is it but my owln, for rushing from him, as I did, and forcing him, as it were, to forget me? Can it be a true atonement that will render two miserable and myself not happy? No 1" These thoughts darted through the mind of Hetty Thorpe with the rapidity of lightning. It took not half the time to feel them that it consumes to record them. And Charles and Julia wondered why the judge had not fin- ished her last sentence; they wondered why -she sat silently there, her face flushing with contending emotion. What could it all mean? But the brief though intense silence is broken once more. "Do you love him?" asks Hetty of Julia, pointing with her forefinger to Charles. "I do," is the simple response of Julia, who is amazed at the abrupt and, at this stage, seemingly needless interrogatory of her companion. "' You cannot be a truly happy woman without him? He is your hope of heart, your life of soul, your next to'God?" contin- ues her examiner. "Whly do you ask her this?  Why thus torture her for naught?'" interrupts Charles, passionately. "Because I do ,iot intend to torture her or you," is the reply. "I here and now re r   426        ERRING, YET NOBLE. She paused again. For the second time she left the sentence inoomplete. R( enounce " was probably the word she intended to pronounce ; but she pronounced it not. A new idea occurred to her mind. A strange thought flashed over the electric wires of her spirit. She reflected upon it a moment. The decision was a favorable one. The new thought was, if not welcomed, at least adopted. Hetty Thorpe suddenly exclaimed : g "Call upon me in three days ; but leave me now." "Three days i" cried Charles. "Three days!" echoed Julia. "Yes," replied Hetety. "Give me three days, and I will give you my answer, my final answer. And now, good-night. I would be alone." Wondering, fearing, yet hoping; astonished, yet not wholly despairing, Julia and Charles departed out into the storm and the night. Butjust as his foot was on the threshold of the street-door, Hetty Thorpe rushed to our hero and kissed him. It did not seem a kiss of passion, but of peace; a kiss with more of spiritual than of sensual emotion in it. And the look which accompanied it had not more of earthly-affection than of almost heavenly sweetness.   ,  The kiss was given; the door was closed; and her visitors were gone. The rain pattered, the clock ticked. Hetty retired to her bed- room, and locked the door. And sounds, partly of weeping, partly of supplication, weie heard from there not long after.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         427 CHAPTER VIII. LOVE'S LAST. THREE days have passed, and Charles and Julia once more are in the presence of Hetty, anxious to learn tlteir fate-fully appreciating their most singular position. Charles' handsome face is pale. Julia's intellectual couinte- rance is, on the contrary, somewhat more flushed than usual. The reason of this physical difference may be accounted for - by the dissimilarity of their present emotions. Charles regards the coming interview with dread ; while Julia looks forward to it with a wild, unaccountable, yet real hope. Why? They wait for Hetty in her little parlor, and mechanically ex- amine her specimens of needle-work, but they speak but little to each other. People seldom do when they feel much. At last, Hetty makes her appearance. She is really beautiful this morning; and there is a-glow of excitement upon her face, a restless agitation in her manner (which she vainly endeavorm to conceaD, and a vague, spb'ituelle look in her eyes which attract irresistibly the attention of her visitors. What does it all por- tend? No matter; they will soon know. Hetty salutes her visitors politely, kindly--shaking hands with them both. Charles and Julia are fearfully embarrassed; but Hetty, though by no means calm, seems determined, and, conse- ^   quently, comparatively at her ease. Her mind is evidently "made up," and she does not keep her companions long in sus- pense. The agony is soon over. After a brief, very brief, and unsatisfactory attempt at gene- ral conversation, Hetty announces her ultimatum. "Charles," she says, turning to Singerly, and looking full into his eyes, with those loving and now so strange orbs of hers,-   428        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "Charles, I claim my right-your promise. I must be your wife. I cannot, must not, live or die, save as your wife, my Charles." That word," my," when used by a woman, and by her applied to a man-how full of meaning it is I How happy it makes the man-! -under favorable circumstances. But when it asserts a right, which he is not at all anxious to concede; when it is spoken by the wrong woman-how wretched the man I And when the right woman, the woman whom the man loves, stands by and hears another woman, whom the man does -not love, assert a claim to the man of her heart, which he dare not resist, how utterly wretched-that woman I How horribly sounds, then, that little sweet word " mly V" It is all over. Charles' fears have been proved true. Julia's hopes have been proved false. The shock is past. They know the worst. Their futures must be separate and sad; but they must do their duty; and Charles, who, years. ago, committed the sin, must now bear the punishment. And why not? Julia Witherson sinned, and was punished. Why should Charles Singerly sin and go unpunished? Is not his sin as great as hers? Certainly. True, the world does not think so; but it is time that the world was taught to think bet- ter. The real truth is, that a man who errs is as bad as a woman who errs. Crime has no sex; and in the eye of God an immoral male is as guilty as an immoral feenale. And both beinga alike guilty, both should alike suffer, aye, and will suffer, if not here, why then hereafter I Charles Singerly suffers here, and now. But he recovers him- self, and replies to Hetty in the simple but expressive words: "Then, I am yours!"P Four short words ; but they are the saddest that Julia With- erson has ever heard. They contain the death-warrant of her love, her holy, happy love. And the glow of false hope is suc- ceeded upon her fine countenance by the pallor of a real despair I Hetty Thorpe now breaks the silence anew, and says: "Do not think me selfish. Do not think me ungrateful!"   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         429 "Oh, no!"Julia forces herself to reply, thlough the words almost choke her. "Oh, no ; you but claim a right--a duty." "Oh, no," reechoes Charles ; "you but demand your own- your own!" The tone of utter wretchedness in which these two last words are spoken is totally indescribable. And then, once more, there is a moment's silence. And two sad and separated hearts, which love, and yet must love no longer, beat loudly in the solemn stillness. "They uttered not a word- But the beating of their own hearts Was all the sound they heard "-- Saving the ticking of the little clock previously referred to. Stray gleams of the sunlight without steal through the window- panes, but utterly unheeded. Julia looks upon Clarles, and Charles looks upon Julia., and Iletty Thorpe looks upon them both. Anud no one of the three speaks. Could you but see the mutual glances of Charles and Julia. Love, sorrow, happy but useless memories, a wretched prospect of a blighted future; a struggle at resignation on her part, remorse on his, are expressed in their eyes and faces. Strongest of all these is the love. They may be parted by fate and by duty ; but they can never, never, never do aught but love one another. Their mutual passion has become a part of their very nature, aud nothing but death can destroy it. Does Hetty Thorpe, who watches her companions with a look of pity, pride, love, and wild determination, combined with an undefinable spirituelle expression, realize the fact that the two beings whom her words have separated in body, can never be separate in heart? Julia sits upon a petite sofa, the only piece of pretentious fur- niture in the apartment. Charles rises in his agitation and walks to and fro through the little parlor. He passes, meclani- cally, his fingers through his hair, a way he has when disturbed. His thoughts are now of a ring and a chain ; of a ring that is on Julia's finger, a ring he gave her, but which must not be   430        ERRINGT YET NOBLE. worn any longer; of a chain that hangs round her neck, and to which is suspended his likeness. But that likeness is now the property of another; and the love which chain and ring alike signify, must be crushed as a crime. Oh, God I it is very hard I Suddenly he -pauses from his pacing to and fro, and looks upon Julia, with an expression indescribable, but which she under. stands. They can endure their agony no longer. They rush into each other's arms, murmuring words, broken sentences, which only their own ears and those of heaven can hear. They clasp each other tightly, fondly. They kiss each other's eyes, and cheeks, and lips. They call each other by every name of fond endearment. Julia's superb form is encircled by her lover's, her onceelover's, aye, her still, adorer's embrace. His ring-spark. ling fingers are passing and repassing nervously through her long, dark, rich hair. And upon the hand which Julia places on his shoulder gleams in the sun-light her betrothal circlet. How they love each other I And Hetty Thorpe stands beside the mantle-piece, near the little clock, which ticks unheeding on, and smiles as she beholds the wretched lovers. Aye, smiles a wild, mysterious smile. Has she no heart? But now she advances to the lovers ; her mood changes. In a sudden she opens her arms, and for a moment holds both Charles and Julia in her embrace, as though she were a parent blessing, and not a rival parting them. What means this? Julia instinctively withdraws from Charles' arms. She cannot endure an embrace which is shared by her successful, her ungene- rous rival. Charles, too, looks up at Hetty, with a glance which says: "Could you not allow me one last farewell?" But Hetty Thorpe now speaks, and utters words which star. tle her hearers almost as much as that solemn command spoken by Him of old, which startled the wondering Jews, when He cried-"Lazarus, come forth t"For-the words she pronounces.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         431 recall from its grave the corpse of their Love and Hope, and give it a new life and being: "Be sad no more. You two shall be husband and wife ere long." Had she said, "You two shall be emperor and empress of the world," it would be nothing to what she has said. Julia's face flushes, like lightning ; Charles' eyes re-gleam; they are enraptured-but full of wonder. "For heaven's sake, oh tell us truly what you mean 1" cries Singerly. "Listen to me," says Hetty Thorpe. Needless request. It might thunder louder than the artillery which levelled the famous old walls of Sumter, but Charles and Julia would heed it not. They have but ears for her--for Het- ty Thorpe, who stands before them, looking upon them with love and pity, with her usually pale face now slightly glowing with internal excitement, and her eyes illumined with a spirituello fire.  And Hetty continues : "I have been, as you know, for a long time in failing health. Until recently, I thought that shame and sorrow were the lead- ing causes of this ; though, of course, I was aware that my bod- ily system was also, in some respects, disordered. But at our last interview, suddenly there catme to my mind the memory of a cer- tain mysterious phrase I had heard a student of medicine use in reference to my case. I dismissed you. I went the next day and consulted privately one of the leading medical men of this city. He explained to me the full meaning of the student's mys- terious expression. In short, he told me what I now. tell you.  I am afflicted with an incurable internal disorder, which must soon end my days on earth. Nothing can alter this. Medicine may somewhat prolong my life, but I must die shortly, and may die at any moment. Now do you not understand me, Charles? Now do you not do me justice, Julia? Do you not now compre- hend my seeming selfishness? I have but a little while to live. I wish to live that little happily; and then I will leave you, and I                 ,   432        EBRING, YET NOBLE. you will be each other's again forever. I must soon depart; I wish to have my shame wiped out before I go ; T wish to die, Charles, in your arms, as I have longed to do all these weary years; thus will-I die happily. I wish to die as your wife; thus will my disgrace be atoned, my sin pardoned ; thus, will I die honorably ; thus, will I be enabled humbly, but confidently, to stand before my Judge; thus, will I bo able to meet my mother there!" She looks upward, and the wild, spiritual lookl in her eyes is more conspicuous ; but it is now accounted for. It is derived from the heavens, to which she is fast approaching. Knowing that she has but a brief space to be upon earth, she is becoming unearthly. Even her love to Charles is more of a spiritual and poetic than merely passionate character; she longs for a union with him chiefly upon moral grounds. Marriage is to her reli- gion. But she proceeds: "I wish you to wed me, Charles. I wish to call you mine, even though it be for a moment. I long to receive from you the embrace of a husband, and to feel that in its holy clasp our early errors are forgotten and forgiven. But do not fear. I shall not be a burden upon you long. Your marriage with me need not be public. You need not even live with me. I but wish to be in the sight of God your wife, not in the sight of man. I can support myself comfortably by my needle-work for a while. All I ask is that you be with me in the hour of death. Be a hus- band to me then. Let me die in your arms, even if I do not live in them. Thus shall I die happy, pure, forgiven. And, after my death, you two shall wed each other-and be blest; but do not entirely forget poor Hetty Thorpe." She paused, through excess of emotion ; and Charles and Julia said not a word. They could not speak. A mingled tide of conflicting feelings rushed through their souls. But Hetty resumed: "I shall bhe glad to die : glad, because in being youA wife I will have tasted all the bliss of earth ; glad, because I cjn leave you to be happy here, and in the future meet you both above!   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        433 But see to it, Charles, my Charles, (you will let me call him ' my Charles' now, will -you not, Julia?) see to it, that I am buried, not in some city graveyard, midst all the din and dust of a town, but lay what remains of me in the country ; place me under the flowers; let me have some quiet nook in some village church- yard, all to myself. And do you and your wife come and visit me there. Spare a moment ever and anon from your living hap- piness to think upon your dead Hetty." How shall we attempt to portray the emotions of the two who listened to all this? Wonder at the strange nature of the communication made to them ;-admiration at the generosity of the speaker; a kind of mysterious reverence for her, as one already stamped, as it were, by the seal of death, mingled with a tender human pity; these feelings possessed the breasts of Charles and Julia alike. Our hero himself was deeply touched by the passion- ate love manifested for him by Hetty Thorpe, and his noble nature was moved to respond to her generosity ; his honor, too, spoke loudly and clearly of his plain, evident duty to this ill-starred woman, the duty of marriage, now doubly dutiful. And yet (for Charles Singerly was human, and there is a dark side to humanity), down in the bottom of his heart, in one of. its corners, lurked a secret, wild joy at the idea that come what might, he could not be separated from his Julia long; that his marriage with Hetty Thorpe (to which even now he felt a bitter repugnance), if it ever took place, would be but a temporary affair. We know not but that Julia Witherson shared in this joy with him; but we do know that this disgraceful, though most natural sentiment, was crushed at once in the hearts of both as soon as it ap- peared, and was driven back with shame into the recesses of the soul, while the nobler and truer emotions reigned supreme. But both Charles and Julia were silent (their minds were too full for their mouths as yet to speak) ; and Hetty Thorpe misinterpreted this stillness. She looked Charles sadly in 19   434  E-RING, YET NOBLE. the face and said, in A tone of touching reproof, "Ah I 1 thought that you would appreciate my position, that you would understand me. I believed " (here her voice grew louder, and she spoke more rapidly) "you would have pity for me even if you had no love-that you would, at least, pre- serve your own honor by redeeming mine -that an hour's ceremony and a nominal bond, whose fetters would be con- cealed, and could at worst bind you but a little while, would not so disgust you as to render you forgetful of pity and your promise. But I have judged you wrongly, and yet I blame you not. I will not insist upon my rights. I will not decide your fate as you yourself but three days since pro- posed. No; you are free. I now make you so. Free from all pledge or obligation to me. Go I Marry her you love, and forget me forever I I can die pure, pure in heaven's sight, even though I be not your wife. God will forgive me, if man will not. Leave me and be happy, and think not of me, for I will soon, I trust, be dead." During this Charles and Julia had each of them endea- vored to interrupt the speaker, but in vain. Hetty spoke with such rapidity, such earnestness (growing more and more excited as she proceeded), that interruption was impossible ; but as she uttered the concluding sentences her voice fell again, and now Charles Singerly spoke. "Forgive me," cried he, " for my silence; but indeed it was not caused by what you think. I could not speak; iny heart was too full ; but I nmust speak now. I must---' " x. No, Charles," broke in Hetty, " no, Charles, perhaps after all have been selfish in my wish to marry you. But, indeed, I never thought of making our marriage public, or of living with you ; and besides I knew that I could not live loner." "Nay, talk not that way; you shall live, and I shall be your husband." "What " cried Hetty, joyfully, "will you, indeed, keep your promise? Will you make me your wife?" "Yes, so help mo heaven " replied Singerly solemnly.   ERRING, 'YET NOBLE.       43; His struggle, his mental conflict was now all over. IL would do his duty, he would, follow the dictates of honor a all hazards. "And will you allow your lover to become my husband?: asked Hetty, turning to Julia. p       "I will be ashamed to think that ever I loved him were h, to refuse," was Julia's reply. Her mental struggle, too, wae over. She, too, was resolved to do her duty, though he: heart should break. "Justitia fiat, ruat coelum." "And yu shall not die," cried Charles; "the best medica attendance shall be procured. No expense shall be sparec to-- " He paused. Suddenly, like a flash of iihlltning, the thougth rushed across his mind that now he was a poor man. The separation from Julia, on which he had resolved, consequent on his contemplated marriage, with Hetty Thorpe, took from him all claim upon the wealth of Miss Witherson, upon which he and his mother had for some time lived. He had no money, no profession of his own. "No, no," said Hetty Thorpe, replying to his last words, "all the wealth, and all the physicians on earth, cannot save me; otherwise I had not asked you to marry me. Charles, I accept your promise. You shall be my husband'while I live. But two things I insist upon -I demand." "Name them," cried Charles. "Name them," reiterated Julia. "First," said Hetty Thorpe, "our marriage must be pri- vate. You must not be known as- my husband, otherwise your prospects in life would be injured. Do you promise me this, Charles?" "I do," he replied, deeply touched by her generosity. "Second, you two must promise me, here and now, that within six months after my death you will wed each other. Do you promise this also? Nay, no words" (seeing that they were about to interrupt her), "do you promise me this?" "I do."   436        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "And I." "Then, Charles, at last you are mine, and I am yours, and all in honor. I know I am not your wife yet, Charles; but I have a foolish fancy. Indulge it. Let me hear you call   ' me your wife. I am not yet, I know, but I will be. So call me your wife just once, Charles!" "My wife, my Hetty," cried Charles, and he embraced her. ' Come, join us in our embrace," cried Hetty to Julia; "for you are of us.- You are my sister till I die, and then you are my, husband's wife." And Julia, Charles and Hetty were wrapped in a triple em- brace. Here was a woman not yet married to a man, calling him her husband; while another woman, who was, till a moment ago, plighted to this man, and whose betrothal contract has not yet been formally annulled, looked on and embraced them both. Here was a man who did not love a woman, surrendering for her sake the woman whom he did love, while this latter woman approves of his action, and the former accepted him, fully aware of his attachment elsewhere. Here was a man who has to marry one woman immediately, and on her death to marry another one specified-both women agreeing to the arrangement. Here was a woman who is about to marry a man as a reli- gious duty, as an atoning ceremony, more than as a matter of the heart, though she loves him deeply. Here was a woman, who at the time of her wedding is ar- ranging for her funeral. Here was a woman, who, though betrothed to a man, yields him to another, though under contract with him to become his second wife at the death of his first. Certainly fate delights, occasionally, in throwing men and women into most peculiar situations I The three embrace. The man, who loves one of the women, and is to marry them both; and the two women, who both love him, and are both to marry him.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         . 431 They stand in Hetty's little parlor, the walls of which are adorned with her handiwork. Their arms are. intertwined, their faces are close together. The manly form  of Charles, th proud, magnificent, graceful form of Julia, and Hetty's smaller and pliant figure, oTrming a group delightful for the eye to con template. The lifght hair of Hettv, and the dark locks of Julia the lighter skin and the staid blue eves of the former, and thl darker complexion and large, black orbs of the latter; form a pleasing contrast-while the rays of sunlight steal in througl the half-closed blinds, and dance about, as if in wonder 'at the scene they reveal. There is a silence too deep for words. Then the three unloose their hold, and converse is resumed. But soon Hetty pleads fatigue, and making an appointment to meet again on the mor row, Charles and Julia are about to depart, when suddenly Hetty sprinigs forward, seizes Charles' hand, and with a gentle force takes from the number of valuable rings which adorr his fingers one ring, a simple, plain gold one, and placine it on the wedding finger of her own hand, smiles and says to Charles: "Now, darling, we are, at least in the sight of heaven, mar and wife. We are wedded, and this shall be miy wedding-ring/.' She kisses him fervently, bids him come in the morning, presses Julia's hand gently, and this interview is over. Charles and Julia walked towards the residence of the Iattel like people in a dream. They now began to realize the singu. larity of the scene just over ; they now commenced to appreciate their own remarkable and embarrassing position. On reaching Julia's residence, the two lovers (if so we car still call them) parted, each full of thoughts that could hardlj be communicated, even to each other. Julia retired to her room, and locked herself in. She remained there for several hours. "We need not detail her reflections suffice it to say, that -could we have seen her at this time, we would have seen her on her knees.   438        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Happy is she who in tempests of the heart trusteth in heaven! As for Charles, his mind was in a tempest. He lived through the day; he went through the mechanical motions of life; to all outward appearsance, he was as usual. But his soul was agitated to its very depths. His position and his prospects were so peculiar, his duties and his feelings so conflicting, lis memo- ries of the past, his status in the present, his probable fate in the future, so in turns possessed his spirit, that he scarcely knew where or what he was. But the day passed on, as all days will, and night came, as it always does, and at last he retired, and ere he sought his couch- he, too, prayed. Happy is he who seeks heaven to counsel him midst the per- plexities of earth. Let us return to Hetty Thorpe. After the door had closed upon the retreating forms of Charles and Julia, she sat for a while upon the settee in her little parlor, motionless as though turned into stone. Of what she thought, we know not; possibly she could not clearly have defined to herself her reflections, for after a crisis, thought is often for a while confused and irregular. Whatever may have been her meditations, the entrance of one of her fellow-lodgers banished them for a season, and brought her back to the routine of common life. But after the usual employments of the day were over, and the twilight approached, she returned to her cosy, though hum- ble room, forgot all every-day- affairs, and thought but of her past, her present, her future ; her sins, her sorrows, her loves, her joys-her life, her death. And while she thoughllt, her hands were busied with the making of a dress--a weddiptg-dress. She had been employed upon this for many months. It had been a fancy of hers that if she ever met her betrayer, her Charles, he would marry her, and she had worked at this garment in the hope of their meeting. And now-there would be need for a wedding-dress indeed "How   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         439 pure and white it is!"' she said to herself, as she hleld it before Iher. And then the thought occurred, that whte was the color not only of weclding-robes but of burial-garments. And she shuddered, for she remembered the doctor's words; she was doomed, she must die soon, yes, soon, certainly, though she was to be so happy. Oh, could she but live I Oh, God, could she but live I She was but a poor, weak, loving woman, and from her heart went up a bitter, agonizing prayer for life. Happiness was in lher grasp, atonement was in her reachll ; all she asked for was life to enjoy the one and perfect the other. Selfish though natural wishes arose with her. The great object, the fond dream of her existence was now on the point of being fulfilled- ' and must she die so soon after its fulfilment? It was too much. She threw herself passionately upon her knees and prayed, her wedding- dress lying unheeded on the floor, and the last gleams of day stealing through the window. But there was no answer given to her wild prayer, and soon her violent emotion subsided. The current of her feelings changed. It was better that her life was fated to be brlief. Better for her, for Charles, for Julia-for all concerned. She would be happy in heaven, and she would leave them ha-ppy on earth. Whereas if she lived, all three would be miserable. If she lived, too, she might sin and suffer; whereas an early death makes holy. She arose and faced her fate. They came to call her to supper. But she declined; she could not eat. So she remained in her little parlor. It grew darker; she stooped and picked up her now neglected wedding- dress, and folded it up carefully, and carried it to her bed-room, which was directly back of the parlor, then returned and sat down. Placing her hand accidentally in the bosom of her dress, she came in contact with the handkerchief which Charles Singerly had given her years ago, on a fatal night, the night which destroyed her peace. The memory of her shame came over her, and she wept, like Peter of old, bitterly. But the proud thought   "O        ERRING, YET NOBLE. that she was soon- to be his wife-aye, was at this very moment his wife in the sight of heaven, quenched her fears. And as she felt the ring upon her finger-the ring which was the pledge of his engagement and of her honor-the ring which she had just taken from his finger, her wedding-ring--she smiled and thanked God in her heart of hearts. Time rolled on. Twilight passed, and night came, down over the earth. A faint reflection of the glorious moonlight pene- trated sweetly and softly even into the narrow court where Hetty lived, and stole into her little parlor. Still she sat there, musing. The days of her childhood returned to her in memory ; the hap- py season of her girlhood revisited hler; a thousand incidents were borne to her recollection across the corpses of long-buried years. A panorama, as it were, of her life was unrolled before her. Then the present, with its singular situations and relations, im: pressed itself upon her thoughts. Charles and Julia, and the matters connected with them occupied her mind. And then loomed up before her mental vision the future, with its near- coming joys, and behind them the awful shadow of an early death.  And still she sat in her little parlor, while the clock on the mantle-piece ticked on, and the specimens of needle-work, in which she took such pride, were thrown into the shadow, as they hung on the walls ; and faint but delicious glimpses of the moon- light without crept in through the half-drawn blinds. And never had she, in the whole course of her life, looked so charming as at the present moment. Nine o'clock chimed forth the steeples of the city-nine o'clock struck the little clock ; still she sat in the moonlight, thinking. Ten o'clock--eleven o'clock-twelve o'clock ; still sat she, think- ing, in the moonlight, and looking beautiful. At last she rose, and retired to her bed-room. But whether her long quietude had fatigued her we know not, but certainly she was now seized by the very demon of unrest. She paced to and fro through her little, plainly-furnished, but neat bed-room ;   ERRLNG, YET NOBLE.         441 then she opened the door which communicated with the parlor and still paced to and fro through both apartments. Actuatec by what impulses we cannot tell, she paused with her candle ir front of the various prints and specimens of needle-work, and examined each attentively. Then she looked at her " library,' as she called it, a collection of about ten or a dozen books opened them one by one, glanced at the fly-leaves, and read the pencilled words on them, recalling the little circumstances con nected with each. Then she wound up the clock, arranged the articles of furniture in the parlor (there were not many to ar range); then went to a drawer of her bureau, in her bed-room took from thence the miniature of her father, a lock of her long dead mother's hair, one or two other family relics, kissed them tenderly, and replaced them. Then she took from another drawer a small letter-box, and glanced over its contents, lingering longest over a little note-- the only note she had received from her betrayer, her to-be hus ,.      band, Charles Singerly. Replacing the. box, she resumed her walks to and fro. The clock struck one ; the clock struck two Her restless fever passed. By an effort she calmed herself, un. dressed, knelt down, prayed long and fervently, and then retired to her couch. The last two things she did before she went to sleep were somewhat strange ; but they had each a meaning, and our read- ers will comprehend it. She put her hand in the bosom of her night-dress, and drawing from thence the handkerchief which Charles had given her, and which ever since had been worn next to her heart, a memorial alike of love and sorrow, sme tore it to pieces. And then she klised the ring upon her finger, Charles: ring, which she had taken-her " wedding-ring." There was no longer need for the token of love and shame; it was replaced by the symbol of love and honor. And then, Hetty Thorpe feel asleep. The next morning, Julia arose feeling that her life was now, indeed, changed, since the change in her relations to her lover. 19*   Charles arose from his couch of restlessness, conscious of but one fact on earth-that he was separated from Julia. The sun arose beautifully and brightly. There was not a cloud to be seen upon the face of the sky. But, strange to say, Hetty Thorpe did not rise at all. Not seeing her, or even hearing her moving about in her room, thinking that she was still asleep, but wondering that she slept so long, the old woman who owned the house knocked at the door of Hctty's apartment. There was no answer. The woman opened the door and entered the bed- room. Hetty Thorpe was in bed, slumbering soundly appar- ently. The old woman advanced towards the couch with the intention of arousing her lodger, when, suddenly, she started, shuddered, almost shrieked. What saw she in that little, humble, neat bed that she should gaze with such an awful stare upon it ? Ah! reader, she saw what you and I have seen, or must see some day-Death ! Hetty Thorpe was dead I The incurable sickness of vwhich she had sploken to her visitors yesterday had done its work before its expected time. It was well that she had read her lettbrs and looked over her pictures and handiwork last night, for she will never s have a chance to read or to look again. She lies upon thlat bed motionless, but beautiful, more lovely dead than she ever has been alive. Blondes alwa) s look beautiful in death. Somehow we have everxcherished a fancy that all the angels are blondes. Hetty's hands are clasped. The ring which she had taken from Charles yesterday sparkles upon her finger in the morn- ing light, and on the floor near the bed are the pieces of the torn handkerchief. Well, she is better where she is. She needs no marriage ceremony now ; her repented sin is pardoned, and she dwells with the angels ; and in heaven they neither marry, nor are given in marriage/ She died pure in the sight of God. She needs no Husband; she has found a Father. Oh I it is better as it is I      *       *       *       *      *      *    At the appointed time Charles and Julia prepared to call upon Hetty Thorpe. But when they reached the door of her humble home they found there suspended that horrible syrn. bol of mourning, the long black crape. The windows were closed ; death was. in the house. , They looked at each other, and the same thought occurred to them both. Hetty Thorpp, the woman they had come to see, the woman who had divided them, the woman who had told them that she soon must die, was dead. Yes, it must be so. They entered the house and found that their instinctive surmise was correct. They were shown into Hetty's little bed-room, and there upon the bed was Hetty. Their emotions as they stood beside the body defy description. Could the sacrifice of their  own lives have restored the corpse to existence they would have gladly died. They thought not thee that the great obstacle to their own happiness was removed. INo selfish musings intruded upon their minds at this awful hour. They remem- bered how generous and laving the dead woman had been to them; and as they could not restore her to earth they prayed for the repose of her soul in heaven. And as Charles Singerly kissed the cold lips of the woman who had so loved him and whom he had so wronged, he fer- vently, in the depths of his soul, implored the pardon of the Almighty upon his youthful error. He had no fears for the departed; she had expiated her yielding fault; she had died in the sight of heaven a pure woman, and his wife; but he prayed for himself. Bitterly, by Hetty Thorpe's bedside did Charles Singerly reproach himself for the sorrow he had brought upon the dead girl. Clearly did he see, in the cold light of the grave, the full extent of his young hot sin. Oh! if libertines could but think, in their hour of desire, on the hour of DEATH, there would be but few victims. Charles Singerly fell upon his knees at the side of the corpse;, he took Hetty's cold, beautiful hand and kissed the simple,- gold ring which the wearer had yesterday taken from his own finger. And then he attempted to take   "4        ERRING, YET NOBI E. it off and replace it again on his own hand as a keepsake ;' but Julia prevented hifn by a gesture. "She would rather that she should be buried with it," said Julia; and she was right; her womanly instinct was true.  Hetty Thorpe, could she have spoken, would, indeed, have protested against the taking off of "her wedding ring," even though it was to be worn as a memorial. Then knelt down at Charles' side, Julia, by the corpse; and in that little darkened room there was silence, death and prayer. After a space our heroine arose, kissed the dead girl upon her forehead, whispered, "My sister, who art in heaven ;" and, accompanied by Charles, left the apartment. A few miles from New York there is an old-fashioned church, with an old-fashioned parsonage, and an old-fashioned grave yard. The section of country which surrounds it is charming, so calm, so fertile, so still. And in the old grave- yard of the old church Hetty Thorpe was buried. Her re- mains were interred in the presence of Charles Sinigerly and Julia Witherson 4s chief mourners. Poor Hetty sleeps peacefully there. In summer time she has the pure red roses, and in winter time she has the pure white snow. And her memory is ever kept green in the hearts of two. Need we name them? They often visit her grave, Does she know it.? We believe she does.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        445 CHAPTER IX. A SMALL INSTALMENT OF RETRIBUTION. HETTY THoRPE is dead and buried. Let us return to the living; and first, let us follow Charles Singerly's example, and visit Henry Hericot, Esq. Charles and Hericot were still intimate, for, though Sing- erly had felt " hurt" at the comparative coldness of the latter in the season of his sickness and poverty, yet where he loved he was of a forgiving nature, and Hericot had, long ere this, taken an opportunity to "explain matters" in his usual plausible manner. So the pair were still on friendly terms. And to-day Charles was more than usually kind. Hericot wished some pecuniary favor trom him (for about the six hundredth time), and for the six hundredth time our hero (who was now, by Julia's wish, in fact her commands, tlle sole controller of her vast property) granted his request, and "accommodated him with a loan." Hericot thanked him profusely, but Charles stopped his thanksgivings. "You know, Harry," he said, "' that you and I are not mere fiiends. We have been, we are, brothers. Do you not re- member our college days, and our college vows ?" Here the speaker paused. 'Alas I he remembered, as he spoke, something more than college vows and college days. He remembered that Henry Hericot was the man who had encouraged his liaison with poor, dead Hetty Thorpe, and the man who had prevented him from doing her justice. For a moment he ceased in his inmost soul to regard Hericot with friendship; but he also remembered that according to the usual code of young men, Hericot had but acted in this   "6        ERRING, YET NOBLE. matter justifiably, and had really meant to do him a service, so the angry thounght passed away. A pleasant conversation ensued, and was continued for a considerable space o'f time. Hericot was anxious to know when his friend was to be married to J ulia Witherson, etc., etc., and Singerly satisfied his curiosity, which is more than we intelld doing for our reader on this point at present. At about three o'clock Charles bade good bye to his friiend and proceeded to keep an appointment with his lawyer, who was engaged in settling, up " the old accounts" which had remained unsettled in consequence of the defalcationl of Charles' agent. During his interview with the lawyer Charles made a singularly unpleasant discovery; which, had he not been the most careless of men in money mat- ters, he would have made long ago. He found, his law- yer convinced him by ocular demonstration, that his clecks upon the bank where he had been, until recently, for many . years in the habit of keeping his account, had been forged ; forged so skilfully that it was difficult to recognize the imi- tation checks from the genuine ones. But there rtas in the former a peculiar w,qy of writing the letter " s," botlh in tile words "Charles" and "Singerly," which, on close exanina- tion, served to distinguish them from the latter. Yes, Ihere was no doubt. The appearance of the checks themsellves, and the -circumstantial evidence connected with them, accumulated by the lawyer, convinced Singerly that he had been, for many months previous to the exodus of his agent, the prey of a sharper. Iis suspicion was at once directed to this agent; but, strange to say, the lawyer insisted -that the agent could have had nothing to do with these forgeries. He also gave Charles his reasons f(or this singrular opinion, which, though we need not detail them here, were satisfactory to our hero. , The question then arose-If not the agent, who was the forger? This question was more easily asked than answered. At any rate the checks were frauds. They were numerous,   ER3RING, YET NOBLE.       447 extending over a considerable period of time; and though their amount was large in the aggregate, yet each of them was drawn for a comparatively small sum, in no case over two hundred dollars ; so that the careless Charles had never detected any discrepancies in lhis accounts. Thus, the crimi- nal, whoever he was, had managed for months to deceive both bank and principals. It was too late, lCharles thought, to discover the perpe- trator of these knaveries, but his lawyer differed from him on this point. "Do people generally know at what bank you keep -your present account?" asked the lawyer. "People do not generally know that I keep a bank account at all now,' was the reply. "Is any one aware of your pecuniary position at this' time, and of your general business liabits? Have you, in short, any person whom you trust wholly and unreservedly in your money matters?" "I am. my own agent now. My old college chum and fast friend, Hericot, is the only one who has my pecuniary confi- dence. To hinz, of course, I have no secrets." "The forger, whovever lie is," rema rke d the lawyer, " must have a wonderful skill in imitatin, lland-writ ings."7 Suddenly the thought flashed across eharilles' mind that Hericot was remarkable among his " set" for the possession of just this very faculty. But this thought nerely " flashed," it remained not; it was dismissed from Charles' mind the moment it originated with indignation. After some converse (during which' it was determined to investigate further, and to set a trap for the criminal, dur- ing which Charles also made a resolve hereafter to be care- , ful instead of careless in business matters, a vow which he faithfully kept), our hero departed from his lawyer's. Mus- ing on these singular, recently-discovered frauds, he took it in his head to call on his friend tHericot to talk the matter over with him. Hericot had "rooms" upon a fashionable street; and as   "8       ERRING, YET NOBLE. -Mr. Singerly was well acquainted with his locale he did not pause at the front door of his house to ring, neither at the door of fhe apartment to knock. It was his general polite custom to do the latter, but providentially on this occasion he forgot his habit, and entered the room without an- nouncement. The apartment was well-furnished, bearing all, the marks of being the "bachelor den" of "a -man about town." At the present moment the furniture was all in confusion, every- thing betokened a debauch the night previous. Surrounded by decanters, glasses, boxes of cigars, corkscrews, etc., Heri- cot sat by a table, his back turned to the door by which Charles entered, busily engaged in writing. So intent was he upon his occupation that he was not aware of the presence of a stranger until a hand was suddenly laid upon his shoulder and another hand endeavored to pos- sess itself of the MSS. upon which his present energies were centered. Certainly Henry Hericot, Esq., must be very nervous this morning, or the papers on which he has been engaged must contain some fearful secret, for, not recognizing in the intrud. er upon his privacy his friend Singerly, he quivers at the touch of the strainge hand like an arrested criminal, and attempts to hide the papers. "Why, Hericot, my boy," says the manly, hearty voice of his friend, "what on earth is the matter with you? one would think you took me for a police officer, come to arrest you as a counterfeiter. You surely are not----" Here the speaker pauses; his face changes color; his eyes flash. What does Charles Singerly see? Ah I he sees too much, more than his companion would have had him behold for worlds.                 ! The papers on which Hericot has been engaged are not all concealed-one of them meets Charles' quick glance. It is a :small, long, rather narrow strip, with some printed devices, letters and blanks upon it. In short it is a "bank   e              3SERING, YET NOBLE.  '      9449 check." Now, there is nothing very strange in this. But, then, it is a check upon the very bank in which Charles Singerly keeps his account Well, this is a mere coinci- dence. Aye, but it is more, much more. The check is " drawn " for the amount of two hundred dol- lars, and is in the handwriting of (not Henry Hericot, or any one else but) Charles Singerly himself. At least, so Charles himself is at first tempted to believe. But no, though his signature is attached to the check it is hot in his handwrit- ing. The letters "s" in his name are written in a slightly peculiar manner, which is the very way in which the let- ters " s are formed in the forged checks, concerning which his lawyer had just been speaking. Singerly takes up the check from the table, Hericot in vain endeavoring to prevent him, and compares it with a forged one handed him by his lawyer, and which he had retained. The handwriting in the two checks, the manner of forming the letters " s, " is precisely similar in both; and, remarkable coincidence, they are both drawn for the same amount, two hundred dollars, so that it would be difficult to tell the two checks apart were it not for the difference in date, and their being on different banks. But both of them were drawn by the same hand in imitation of the same handwriting; and they both were forgetries. Charles Singerly stands for a moment amazed; then the thought once more flashes like lightning across his mind that Hericot has always been noted among his friends for his dex- terity in imitatitng handwritings. Hie was tlius a man whlo could forge it if he would. He knew all his (Singerly's) busi- ness habits too, and had long enjoyed all facilities for defraud- ing him, if so disposed. This very forged check which he had just taken from Hericot's table was drawn upon a bank in which few but Hericot knew that Singerly kept any ac- count. It was drawn, too, in a peculiar form of words, which he (Singerly) had recently adopted since his becoming the custodian of Julia Witherson's property, and which was   450        ERRING, YET NOBLE. known to very few. Can it be that his friend, his intimate his trusted companion is a   I "Oh, no!" says Charles to himself, in the depths of his noble soul, recovering from his first momentary shock. "I cannot doubt my friend." But le glances at Hericot. And one look forces him to feel that his friend has deceived him. Our hero's reflections, which we have taken some time to de- scribe, consumed, in reality, but a moment. Still that period was sufficient to develope the real cowardice and meanness of tHericot's nature. As Charles gazed at him, never was a more life-like picture of guilt painted than his face. He looks like a whipped hound ; like a detected criminal; and sadly, stunning- ly, but irresistibly, the conviction forces itself upon Singerly's mind that the man he has for many years loved and trusted as a brother, spite of palpable faults, has been unworthy; has been a forger and a thief-robbing the very man who literally had- fed him. In that parlor, with its disarranged furniture ; by that table, with its decanters, glasses, boxes of cigars, and meerschaum pipes, stands our hero, with his handsome, classical face, vary- ing, like his soul, with the- mingled emotions of sorrow and of' anger-while Hericot crouches on a seat near him, pale and trembling. Charles holds in his hand the two forged checks and points to them indignantly, while Hericot clutches the remainder, upon which he has been "practising," endeavoring mechanically but uselessly to conceal them, while he inwardly curses his "damned folly," in leaving his room door open, so that Singerly could enter. But the shrewdest rogues often  commit some piece of I' damned folly." It is a-wise dispensation of heaven. At last Hericot finds words. "Do not expose me publicly i" he-gasps. He is so frightened that he dares not lie. His own words, his selfish prayer for personal safety, gives to Charles the only additional proof needed of the speaker's guilt.          ,  ,   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         451 "Expose you!" cries Singerly. "I am no thief-taker--even though you be a thief. Still it would make a sensation in fashionable circles, were it to be announced that the handsome, dashing Henry Hericot was a forrer, and robbed his friends!" The last words are spoken bitterly. Charles' wounded feel-   '   inMgs find vent awhile in sarcasm. He continued, looking at Hericot: "You would appear to advantage in the criminal's dock. Your lady mistresses would flock in crowds -to see you in your new role. Your fellows, who caroused with you in this very room last night, would come and gaze at you curiously, and say, each to the other, ' Well, I always wondered where Hericot got all the money from to give his " late suppers " with i' And then you would look so handsome, and, of course, so smiling. And your name would be so conspicuous in the ' Court Reports,' and your likeness would be so accurately given in the Police Gazette. And all this would help you so much in your worldly career, it would aid you so materially in obtaining your ' rich wife,' and your 'fashionable establishment.' Oh, I must ' e xpose you pub- licly,' as you call it, after all. Such an opportunity for a sensation must not be lost.  Oh, certainly, I must expose you!" Hericot raised his head and looked at Singelyv, as if in doubt whether or no the latter intended to execute his threat. But his companion's face gave no sign of jesting, unless it were of the most bitter sort. Then, for a moment, the idea sug- gested itself to --Hericot of escape, of resistance, of obtaining from Singerly, by force, the proof of his guilt that he held-the forged checks. Suddenly tearing, by a quick movement, the pieces of paper that he still held in his own hand, Hericot made a rush upoa his unwelcome visitor. He was a coward, but even a coward will fight when brought to bay. But Singerly was too strong for him, and seizing him with a firm grasp; prevented his design.* Then Henry Hericot, Esq., lost his courage again, became once more an abject coward, and begged for mercy r   452        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "Oh I for God's sake be a man, even if you are a villain!" cries Singerlv, in disgust. "Let me not find that the person who has been my intimate for so many years, is a craven as well as a forger. Get up from your knees. If you never kneel to heaven don't kneel- to me. Get up, I say. "Why, what a fool you have been," continues Singerly; "what a consummate fool, to risk your soul, or what you regard more, all -your worldly chances by forging upon a man from whom you -could borrow, at any moment, all the money you wanted; from whom, in fact, you have received large sums, whose purse has been for years yours!" The memory of the favors he had showered upon Hericot, and the base requital he had met with, seems to stir Charles' anger, as is most natural. In truth it is most strange that he has not grown indignant long before this. "You base wretch," he cries, his eyes flashing ; " you heart- less ingrate, you most accomplished deceiver, you " but he checks himself, pauses, grows calmer, colder, more bitter, then proceeds : "You fool, you have killed your goose, that laid your golden eggs I For the sake of the guilty chance of a few hundred dol- lars, you have forever prevented yourself from obtaining, freely and fairly, from me, as many thousands. You have placed your position, your liberty, yourself, in the power of a man who is no longer your friend nor your dupe. Idiot, did you not know that sin is folly, and that every sinner is .a fool?" Hericot writhes under these words, and matters something inaudible. He looks, and, we dare say, feels, unutterably mean. Singerly glances at him in his abjectness a moment, and sud- denly his mood changes. "And to think," he cries, " how I have loved that man I Oh, Henry 1 lhe exclaims, his voice becoming lower, more tender even, "oh, Henry! I once looked upon you as my brother. Your very faults were almost sacred in my eyes. We were chil- dren together, school-boys together-college-mates, class-mates, * 8   ,.             ERRING, YET NOBLE.         453 life-mates. I have had no secrets from you, pecuniary or person. al. I have been ever your true friend, your brother of the heart. I have been warned against you, but I indignantly repelled what I deemed to be slanders, and have trusted you all the more. My purse has been yours, my time yours, my influence yours, my home yours, my heart yours. What more could you have had? You were knit to my soul, as David to Jonathan, as Pythias to Damon. I had no schemes, no plans for life, in which you did not bear a part. And now---and now  " His voice falters, and tears, aye, tears, force their way into'his manly eyes. We say " manly," for Charles Siugerly was never more of a man than at this moment, when he weeps over a for- ever-lost friend ; a friend lost forever by worse than death-by deceit. Hericot notices the change in Singerly's demeanor, and the idea rushes across his mind to take advantage of this " melting mood." He is a man wonderfully fertile in resources, and utterly unscrupulous. He sees that he cannot deny his guilt, but that by trumping up a tale of romance and sorrow as a motive for his crime, he may yet escape from the dilemma in which he is in- volved. So he "plays his cards" at once.- "O h, Charles!" he cries, "I am not so guilty as you thinlk me." The fellow's handsome face absolutely began to assume a look of " indignant virtue." Singerly listened, amazed; but yet, in his inmost soul, de. lighted: that the man he had loved might prove to be not such a wretch -after all. His pleasure at this prospect can be appreciated by every noble heart. r     Hericot began humbly: "Charles,-I can offer some slight extenuation for my sin. The forged checks were not for my own use ; I drew them to comply with the urgent demands of a man who had me in his power. He came to me, demanding money; I had none to give him; you were absent from the city ; in desperation, I used your name to obtain funds, which I well knew you would grant me had you \r   454        ERRING, YET NOBLE. been within my reach. I meant to replace the sums in a short time. I intended to tell you of .my bold attempts; but I was dcisappointed in my first design, and lacked the moral courage to fulfil my second. But, still, I have been inexcusably criminal. i; a I offer no apology. I have no adequate one to give. But I i-  can, at least, repay, pecuniarily, your losses.' I .have received lately a few thousand dollars. I give it all to you. It is noth- ing. I can never atone my fault, I deserve exposure. But, most of all, do I deserve punishment for my violation of the sa- cred obligations of our friendship, our life-long brotherhood. I repent, I have long repented, thourrh I, but this very hour, under the pressure of that cursed man, was about to sin again. Do with me as you will. You take all of life worth having from me when you withdraw your friendsl ip." His humility of tone (though it was merely assumed), his re- pentance (though it was a mockery), his excuses (though they were all inventions), his ofs of of recompense (though they were worth nothing), his allusions to their friiendshp (though not one of them was heartfelt), all of these had an effect upon the gene- rous soul of his companion. 01i I Hcricot was, indeed, a most consummate and accomplished liar I And then he was such a capital actor I His eye expressed such apparently genuine emotions ; his handsome face seemed so truly penitential; his attitude was so resigned ; and his words so de- spairing, that, as Charles Singerly gazed and listened, the mem- ory of " old times" came over his spirit ; and he would, theu and there, have freely forgiven his companion, had not a peculiar incident now occurred. As Singerly w:as on the point of offering his hand to thr, pseu- do-repentant Hericot, in token' of his pardon, his glance, chanc- ing to wander momentarily, happened to fall upon a diamondq cross, which was lying carelessly exposed in a n open casket, on a small table in a corner of the apartment. It was of remarkable workmanship; and, at once, like the lightning-flash, the memory of the diamond cross of which Julia Witherson had spoken to him years ago as having been retained by her betrayer, rushed   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         45, across his mind. Singerly remembered well her description of the cross, and this one before him tallied exactly with it. Proba. bly it was the same; and, probably, Henry Hericot was the be- trayer of Julia Witherson. In an instant, various circumstances in connection with these parties, which had hitherto been comparatively unnoticed, now assumed a new and damning significance to the mental vision of Charles Singerly. The distaste, concealed yet sufficiently evident, which each party had evinced for the other; particular occasions of mutual embarrassment ; a striking coincidence ,in the dates of certain events in the history of both, such as their mutual residence in Paris; all these were little links in the chain of evidence.- Still, there was room for doubt. Singerly's brain was on fire. He determined to be satisfied at once. So he advanced suddenly to the little table in the corner, seized the diamond cross, and held it before the astonished gaze of his companion. "Answer me truly," he cried: * Did not this cross belong to Miss Witherson?   Is it not the cross which her dead mother gave her, and which she, in a. moment of infatuation, gave to you, and which you have basely retained, against her wislies merelv on account of its possible pecuniary value?  Are you not the betrayer, the seducer, (how he hissed these words I) of Julia Witherson?   Answer me truly, by the living God I or living devil I!" Taken by surprise ; cursing the luck, which had allowed him carelessly to expose this token, which for years he had kept care- fully concealed ;  astonished beyond measure that Charles was aware of the former seduction of the woman to whom he was, at that very moment, betrothed;  ignorant of how much Julia had told Charles ; fearful of the vehemence of his manner and of the wild light in his eye; confused, startled, Hericot denied not the charge brought against him. He, looked and   felt the very pic- ture, as well as reality, of conscious guilt. Still he said nothing--he confessed not; there might yet   456        ERRINGO, YET NOBLE. be some mistake. Charles would be further satisfied.  He looked at the cross which he held; it was a very peculiar one; it answered precisely to the description given. Besides, he had just found Hericot guilty of one crime, and it was most likely that he was not innocent of another; and he had always been unscrupulous with women.  PMore than all, some subtle instinct told Singerly that Providence was now unraveling at once all the mysteries of his companion's sins. "Answer me," cried our hero,-"I will know : Are you the man who, years ago, betrayed her?" Hericot, completely cowed, stammered out a reply, which was in the affirmative-if in anything. Like a tiger upon his prey, Singerly rushed upon his former friend. Hericot was a powerful man, but his physical strength was naught now, opposed to the frenzied force of the indignant Charles. In the madness of the moment, if Singerly had possessed a knife, pistol, or other deadly weapon, there would have been murder done. Never was a man more enraged than he, nor more justly. He caught Hericot by the throat, and threw him struggling upon the floor, and would have strangled him. A thousand mingled stormy emotions gave Singerly the power of a giant: the love and kindness he had shown for years so betrayed, so abused; the robberies perpetrated by this trusted rascal; the lies just told to him in this very apartment (for Charles' instinct now told him that all Hericot's recent pa- thetic apology was an audacious falsehood); the thoughts of all these nerved his arm. But, chiefly, the wrongs of Julia inspired his vengeance.  He thought of her abused trust; her despised love; her mocked at tears and prayers; her desertion; her agonies of shame and remorse ; the sorrow and the long bitterness he himself had experienced upon her account; and the memory of all this sent a thrill of fire through his every vein, and almost maddened him.   F     -,         ERRING, TYT NOBLE.        457 Singerlyv was by nature a most passionate man, and now his temper, long repressed, burst forth. Hericot, in mortal fear, gave himself up for dead. The grasp of his once friend tightened round his throat, and, as he struggled, the table upon which he had been writing, fell upon him with all its weight of decanters, 7 and still further crushed him. But Charles' wrathful mood was as brief as it was violent. He recollected himself, by a mighty effort of will took off his hand from the throat of his companion, and arose. Hericot was too exhausted and too cowed to follow his example, and still lay panting on the floor. "Arise," cried Singerly,-" arise, traitor, liar, thief, libertine, coward!'  As he spoke, he touched the prostrate form of the man he addressed with his foot, mockingly and loathingly, as he would have kicked a piece of carrion. "Arise," cried Singerly again; and Hericot rose slowly, sorely, meanly, like a whipped hound. "To think," exclaimed Charles bitterly, "that such a creature should have such a woman in his power-that such a reptile should be a cause of shame to my -* " Even as he -spoke, a diabolical smile of malignant glee, mingled with the cowed expression of Hericot's face, which had Singerly perceived, he would, undoubtedly, have killed him on the spot. But Charles saw it not; and suddenly his face was transfigured; it grew bright with a sudden glorious thought. "She shall not be in his power," he cried, "but he in hers; he shall not trinmph over her, but she o'er him; he shall no longer be to her a cause of shame, but of glory. Yes, yes, it shall be so; it will be at once a reward and a / retribution. ' Then turning to the astounded Hericot he said, "Take your hat and come with me." "Where?"Hericot found courage to ask. "To Miss Witherson," was the reply. 20   4585       mRING, YET NOBLE. "And what to do?" asked Hericot. "No matter what, whatever I command you," said Sing erly sternly. "Make ready; follow me; and bear in mind that if you attempt to leave me, or to refuse to comply with my desires, I hand you over at once to the civil authorities as a forger." Cursing heaven, earth, hell, his conqueror and himself, Henry Hericot proceeded to attire himself hastily for the street, wondering greatly. Singerly spoke not another word; and when his companion, who had not yet recovered from the effects of the struggle and attempted strangulation, had at last completed his street toilet, the two "firiends," now enemies, departed together, Charles keeping a watchful eye upon his follower. -And thus, endeavoring to conceal their intense inward agi- tation; with hearts full of hatred, though their faces were smiling as they returned the salutations of their acquain- tances; the one with his soul full of a strange and glorious purpose, the other's spirit possessed by the devils of fear and shame; the two men passed on through the crowded streets, in the pleasant sunshine. ,   ^1.              EBRRING, YET NOBLE.        459 iC 1 A?T E R X. -- AN INSTALLMENT OF TRIUMPH JULIA WITHERSON sat by the window, awaiting the arrival of her lover. It was past the time he had promised to call, but she was .not too impatient. And as the beautiful after- noon wore on towards twilight, she sat thinking. Her medi- tations were both sad and sweet; but they terminated in grateful praise to heaven. And as she thought upon Charles she blessed'him. A ring is heard at the door-bell of her uncle's (or rather her own) magnificent residence. It is his (her lover's) ring. She rises and crosses the splendidly furnished room, and meets her lover at the door. She kisses him fondly; but he scarcely returns her kiss ; he is strangely agitated; his face is flushed, yet partly frowning; and he is r ot alone; Henry Hericot is with him; and he, too, looks strangely pale and excited. What can this all mean? "Ah, Charles,' she murmurs in his ear, "I d;id not expect any one, save you. And why have you brought him?  Oh  I cannot endure him." "I know it," is her lover's reply; " and I also know your reason." "My reason," repeats Julia, annoyed. "Yes," cried her lover, ' I know why you hate and despise, and have a right to despise and hate that man, Henry Heri cot, Esq., as he calls himself, fool, forger, liar and libertine as I call him." "Why, Charles, what do you mean?" asls she. "I mean, Julia, that I know all; that Henry Hericot, years ago, was the cause of your-I cannot utter the '-   "O        ERRING, YET NOBLE. but you will understand me. In brief, this man before us was the man who deceived you in Paris, and darkened, by his cursed arts, the light of your young life. You compre- hend me?' "But too well, Charles." Her lover did, indeed, know all. The only secret connected with her past was now re- vealed to him. What was he about to do? "How I discovered all this I will not tell you now : suffice it to say I know him to be a seducer and a swindler. You wonder why I have polluted your dwelling with the presence of this man. I will explain. I have brought him here for two reasons : first, to show you that I have found him out, that I am no longer either his friend or his dupe; second, in order that you may know him for yourself." "Alas!" cried Julia, sadly and truly, "I know him but too well." She gazes at Hericot. And as she looks, memory recalls the scenes which have transpired between her and this man. She shudders, yet she almost pities. And Hericot gazes at Julia. And she is so handsome, so superbly glorious, this afternoon, that he curses his folly in aban- doning such a beautiful creature. In all his perplexities, he is still the same gross sensualist. But she is now beyond his reach forever I Charles Singerly continues thus : "Julia, the man whom you was once mad enough to love, and to dream that he loved you, is a common thief, a detected forger I Yes, the handsome, ac- complished, fashionable, successful Henry Hericot, Esq., is a criminal of the meanest kind--one who has robbed his friend. See, here are the checks forged in my name by him. I. wish you, Julia, to take particular notice of them. Why, that fellow is too despicable to be called a man. I will tell you how I dis- covered his secret ,and yours; through his very meanness; by' the very diamond cross he refused to return to you, because it was pecuniarily valuable. See, here it is." "Oh, my diamond cross-my dear, dead mother's diamond ..    ,     -ERRING, YET NOBLE.                    461 cross!" cries Julia, joyfully, as she receives the relic from the hands of her lover. "Now I feel indeed forgiven. Charles, now I can fancy that my mother looks down upon me from heaven and smiles. It is the lost relic of my early sin. The relic is restored and the sin is pardoned." She lifts her new-found treasure to her lips, and raises her beautiful eyes upwards, and Charles kisses her. Henry Hericot smiles contemptuously at the kissing of the cross, but is stirred with unpleasant emotions of jealousy at the kissing of the lovers. But he says nothing; during all the abuse heaped by Charles upon him he has had naught to say, he is dumb, either through shame, fear, or policy. Charles resumes thus : "And now, Julia, your-would-be destroyer is in your power The tables are turned upon him, and retribution has overtaken him. He has thought, doubtless, that you are at his mercy that he can cause you shame and triumph over you. But he has made a mistake; he has reckoned without Providence. You are his superior now-you hold the winning cards. We can disgrace him at any moment; we can hand him over when we please as a criminal; he is at our mercy--at your mercy. Fool you have lost a woman who is beautiful; and you worship beauty. Fool, you have lost a woman who is rich; and you god is money. Fool, you have lost a true friend, the only friend you ever had. Fool, you have not even succeeded in disgracing the woman whom  you deceived and abandoned.  She has through you become pure-and my wife. Fool, villain, coward we have triumphed over you in every earthly way, and we leave the rest to heaven."   ,While Singerly thus addresses him, Hericot writhes, as we he may. For it is all true, what is said. He has indeed been fool, as well as knave. Virtue would have served his turn i the end better than vice; but it is now too late. And I writhes in impotent anguish. But, if he is in their power, are not they also in his? If the can, at will, proclaim him a forger, can he not, at will, proclaim   "2       - ERRING, YET NOBLE. to the world Julia's shame? And rather than he should do this, would not they gladly hold their peace in regard to his mis. demeanors? Yes, yes. All is not yet lost; he, too, holds a trump card; and he smiles. But Singerly continues addressing him-: "Go. Rid us of your presence forever. But, ere you depart, there is one thing yet to be done. Down on your knees and beg this woman's par- don; down on your knees, I say," Julia started. The command, though just, was so strange. Hericot also started. This last proposed humiliation was too much. Kneel to a woman, and to her, of all women I Liar and coward, as he was, this- was more than he could endure. He answered, "Niever!" "Do you refuse to kneel?" asked Singerly. "I do-you are mad!" was the reply. "Then," said Charles, "I will, as I have threatened, expose you ; you have had a surfeit of vice.; you shall increase your repertoire of experiences by a practical knowledge of shame." Charles' eye flashed. He looked and felt, fiery and indignant. Hericot was now thoroughly firightened as well as astonished. His heart told him that Singerly would keep his word; that his friend, now his enemy, would, indeed, expose him unless hle com- plied with his request, strange and debasing as it mighlt be. He was o n the point of yieldinga, but first he would, coward though he was, make one last effort at resistance. So he muttered aloud something which, in a vague, rambling way, hinted at the knowledge he possessed of Julia Witherson's dishonor, and of the hold that this knowledge gave him upon Charles Singerly. If Singerly exposed him (Hericot) he, Heri- cot, would, thrdugho the woman he loved, expose lim (Singerly). But he did not proceed far with this base threat. Ere he had half stated his hint, Charles understood it, and approached him, his face dark with passion. He was indeed dangerous now,; yet he was not violent; he merely grasped Hericot by the arm and   j,              EERING  YE'T NOBLE.        463 463 hissed, "Another word, and by the living God I'll beat you to death." He would have kept his oath. Julia Witherson looked on. She had 'understood Hericot's threat, and, Christian as she was, she would not, we believe, have interfered had her lover struck her seducer dead at her feet. She'was a WOrIAN as well as a Christian. Hericot ceases hint or threat, and is pale and speechless. "Will you kneel and ask her pardon?" asked Singerly. "I will-will render her an--an apology," stammered Hericot. "Upon your knees," added Charles. "Why do you wish me to--to-klilleel?" asked Hericot. "That your humiliation may be thorough. You would have relentlessly disgraced her; I shall as relentlessly disgrace you. A man is as   erving of shame as a woman i; aye, double her portion of shame is due him, as Ihe is double the offender. So fall down on your knees before the woman you would have caused to fall down into perdition. I am a poet, and I like poetic jus- tice. I will give you three minutes. If not on your knees in that period you shall be in the Tombs within three hours." So saying, Singerly took out his watch, a'nd held it in his hand. One minute passed in perfect silence. The last rays of the setting sun stole through the windows. Julia gazed at her lover and her betrayer alternately. Singerly gazed at his watch intently, and Henry Hericot gazed around him wildly.. Another minute passed as the previous one. The second minute expired. "You have but 60 seconds left to decide whether to kneel for a moment or to be ruined for a life. Come, Julia, stand beside me, my arm around you. Now, Sirrah, kneel to us both." Thus cried Charles; and as he was about to shut his watch at the expiration of the third minute, Hericot, with his fearful mental struggle daguerreotyped upon his face, suddenly fell upon his knees before the lovers. His cup of humiliation was drained to the very dregs. And Charles and Julia smiled proudly. Henry Hericot is gone.  He departs with a curse. Charles Singerly, too, is gone. But he depart with a kiss   ZVE        ERRINa, YET iIOBLE. c OHAPTER XI. TWO FEMALE FRIEXD. AFTER the departure of her present lover and her former betrayer, Julia still remained seated in her magnificent parlor, musing over the scene she had just witnessed. Her sensations were those of pride. She had won the victory over her once victor; she was dignified in her own eyes, and in his who had years ago striven to degrade her utterly. Her frame expanded, her eye kindled, her soul was glorified. But soon pride gave place to pity for his humiliation, even though he had so injured her. And she not only pitied, but prayed in her soul for him ; as she sat watching the streets aind the twilight. But suddenly she sees a female form ascend the steps of her dwelling; a ring is heard at the door, and is answered by the servant, and MBiss Kate Somers enters. Adesultory conversation takes place between "the friends" on the various topics of the day. But Miss Somers is evidently ill at ease; she has "something on her mind," and she glances -occasionally towards her companion with looks the reverse of friendly. She is "itching" for a quarrel, and at last she seizes her opportunity, and commences one. We need not remind our readers that Miss Somers, though nominally and professedly (on her part) " the intimate " of Miss Witherson; though having enjoyed Miss W.'s favors, pecuniary and otherwise, foir many years; is yet, at heart, her enemy. And now she throws off the mask of friendship, and, actuated by jealousy, rivalry, envy, malice, and many other like evil pas- sions, attacks Julia with bitterness. She feels, on this occasion, particularly hostilo to Miss   4   -^       ERRING, YET NOBLE.        46 '; ., ,.*'                    Witherson, from some gossip she has heard, concerning some plans of hers with which our heroine has recently felt it her duty to interfere, and so to-day her dislike has culminated, and she has determined, come what may, to indulge in that peculiarly feminine luxury, wh-ich is vulgarly called, " venting one's spite." And she vents it. She is restrained by no gratitude, friendship, delicacy, or even the dictates of ordinary polite- ness. It is a melancholy fact that " ladies" will, occasion- ally, " forget themselves" (to phrase it mildly) ; and when this does happen they are ten times more desperate and less scrupulous than men. And so regardless of " the situation," and of " etiquette," Miss Katherine Somers gives way to her spleen. Of course, during the last few years various stray hints or morceaux of gossip, more or less correct, have transpired concerning Miss Witherson's career (though nothing definite or dangerous); and of such of these as suit her purpose Miss Somers avails herself, exaggerating them when neces- sary. Shle speaks of Julia's formerly somewhat lax code of religion, her ditto code of morals, her gay Parisian life. She then alludes to hcr present " bigotry" and "Puritanical stiff- lacedness ;' to her pecuniary " extravagance" and " pride ; to her strange "Utopian plans of reform ;" and last but not least, to what Miss Somers designates as Miss Witherson's "flirtations" and " social interferences." This last is pecu- liarly inspired by a reminiscence of Julia's success in a quar- ter where she herself had failed, i. e. Charles Singerly. Julia Witherson listens to her "friend," but she is not surprised; she is prepared for just such an interview as this, and so at last she speaks: "I see you wish to quarrel. Politeness would suggest that you should not have called upon me at my own house to do so; but no matter, I have long known your true charac- ter, and - at what price to value your 'friendship.' As you'd have now given me the opportunity I am determined to end all connection between us." 20*  "6        ERRING) YET NOBLE. "Indeed," rejoins Miss Somers, " indeed." Julia has so often passed by her uncivil conduct unnoticed that Miss Somers has forgotten that there is such a thing as "going too fare" but now she suddenly remembers that after all she can hardly afford to quarrel with Julia. But there is no receding. "Yes," continues Miss Withersont, "I am desirous of end- ing the farce of our intimacy. Sometimes friendship proves a 'tragedy ;' in our place it has long been a broad ' comedy ;' and it has now reached italast act." "As you please," says Miss Solncrs, bold in tongue, but rather blank at heart. "I owe you no explanation as to my early life," continued Miss Withlerson. "I have made mistakes; so have we all. I regret mine, have repented, and have got rid of them. I have been 'gay' and 'worldly'--I am so no longer. iMy life at present is neither ' bigoted' or 'Puritanical,' but what you cannot understand, a Christian. That I am not ' proud ' my association with you is proof; and if I am some- what 'extravagant,' I, at least, am liberal. As to my ' plans of reform,' they are, successful; and as to my ' flirta- tions,/ I can only answer that I do not flirt. The charge of 'social interference' is unfounded. I have only to ask you whether I ever ' interfered ' with your cunning plans for the capture of Mr. Charles Singerly?" This last was a home-thrust; and Miss Somers colored in high indignation. "Do you dare to accuse me," she cries, "of efideavoring to- to--" She paused. Our heroine completed the sentence, "to ensnare Mr. Charles Singerly? I do." "Then I resent the base insinuation, and I cast you off for ever." "From what?" asked Miss Witherson, as if amazed. "From my- from my- my friendship," was the reply. "I never possessed it," was the simple but sufficient re- joinder of Julia.   fE             ERRING, YET NOBLE.        467 "Then I will leave your house instantly and for ever," said Miss Somers, attempting the majestic, and rising. "Stay a moment if you please," rejoined Miss Witherson, beckoning her visitor to resume her seat. Then with a genu- ine majesty of demeanor, she continued,' I have a few last words to say to you. You have objected to my religion, my morals and my life; let me show you the life, morals and religion of some of my censors. Their piety is a cloak for Sunday wear, far too fine for the rest of the week. Saints as they are, they act remarkably like sinners. They rever- ence God so much that they never talk of Him; seldom, if ever, think of Him. As for the 'charity' which he so blesses, they ignore it. Religion is to them merely a respec- table, irksome form by which they can gain an immortality of bliss without the 'bore' of a pious 'life.' Their mora- lity is of the surface altogether; it consists solely in nega- tives-in not saying certain words, in not performing certaiu actions, in not attending certain places; not, however, be- cause these are objectionable, but because they are unfashion- able, while words, actions and places are permitted equally vicious, or more so, which have attached to them the worth- less sanction of a corrupt  society. The world is alike, in their morals and their religion, everything ; right, truth, God, and genuine purity nothing ; while their life is useless, worthless, free from vulgar vice, but full of fashionable iniquity; an existence of eating, drinking, flirting, dancing, gossiping, slandering, idling, and genteel sinning. And yet they  pretend to be 'censors.' Well, God will judge them some day, and by His own rules.   Such are some of my critics, and the critics of such as me." "Do you include me in your description?" asked Miss Somers, with that look of "indignant virtue" so peculiar to her class. "There is a vulgar proverb," rejoined Miss Witherson,-" ' if the cap fits, wear it.'" "I do not understand your 'slang,' replied the elegant Miss Somers, contemptuously.   "8        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "I will explain it then," said Julia. "I do include you, Miss Katherine Somers, among those I have just described. I do re- gard you as, alike in religion, morals and life, an emphatic hypo- crite." "You insult me," interrupted Miss Somers. N"ot as you have insulted vne," was the calm reply; "for I speak the truth. Let me tell you one solemn fact, which your world may deny, but which is God's own truth, and which I have been taught by experience. There is many a man and many a woman whom society condemns and despises, who is vastly superior and infinitely purer than those whom it adores. There is many a criminal in the cell of a prison who is less guilty than the million- aire in his avenue mansion. There is many a woman who walks our streets nightly, who is more truly virtuous than the ' lady' who brushes past her, escorted in all the pomp of fashion. I There is many a woman who hlas fallen, repented and risen, who is far more pure than she who has never technically " fallen." There is many a woman, like me, were I ten times worse than you have hinted, who is a truer and purer woman, by far, than- such as you." "Your theories are outrageous--but all the more worthy of you," replied Miss Somers, defiant still, though in heart (if she fiad a heart) she writhed at the truth of her companion's words. "And now," said Julia, unheeding this last interruption, "you see, I know you. Let me tell you more : you have never been my friend, but my secret enemy-my rival." "Your rival 1" "Yes ; you endeavored to ensnare Charles Singerly--the man who is soon to be my husband. You attempted unworthy arts and baseless slander-but in vain. Since I have inherited my present wealth, you have ' todied' to me, though you have hated me. You see you have not deceived me. And now, go. You have sought a quarrel with me, and I lhave gratified you; only I hlave the best of the quarrel. You owe me a considerable sum of money-- kep it. All that you have of mine, retain ; but go. Henceforth we are the merest acquaintances only.   ErIG, YETnS               r NOBLE.        469 Two hours afterwards, Miss Kate Somers was in her own room, cursing inwardly the victory which Julia had just won over her, and cursiing, too, her own folly, which had forever lost her a "most useful" friend. While Julia sat in the. moonlight with her lover.  K !l     .-            470        ERRYnrG, YET NOBLe. CHAPTER XII. A CLERGYIAN- IN A NEW CHARAOTER. AFTER the scene of his crowning liumiliation, Iteury ITericot, Esq., rushed, rather than walked, to his "rooms"; and, hav. ing gained their privacy, and assured himself this time that the door was locked, and he was secure from intrusion, aban- doned himself to his-feelings. And yet he hardly knew himself -what he felt, for his brain and soul were in a whirl. He cursed the chance, for so he deemed it, which led Singerly so unexpectedly to visit him; the chance which exposed the forged checks and the diamond cross to his eyes. He cursed Sin- gerly, Julia,: and his own cowardice. He cursed fortune, that hid so-arranged it that he had, by his own conduct, lost the very man and woman whom it was ]his interest to preserve for himself. He cursed the triumph which this man and  this woman had obtained. He was mad with rage ; and yet his rage was futile. Was there no method by which he could restore Singerly and Julia to his uses againu? ,None.  Was there then no way to have revenge upon them?  None. And now he was at bay ; abandoned by his friend, his banker -placed forever in that man's power; deeply in debt, and none to aid him ; humiliated basely before a woman whom he would lnow  give the world to possess, but whomni he had lost forever by his own wilful madness. Gods! his reflections to-night certainlly were not enviable I Truly, the way of the transgressor is hard I An  hour or two passed by. He took no note of time. A knock was heard at the door. He heeded it not. It was re- peated. "Who's there?" lihe cried, without moving from the chair on which he had thrown himself. "A friend-do you not know  e? Come, let me in. -I have come  to take you to the o      '        I             EERRING, YET NOOBLE.        471 :If  ttheatre,' replied a familiar voice. Heric6t arose and opened the door; refused, at first, to go to theo go tho te teatre; but changed his mind. Swallowitng a great quantity of brandy, he departed with his companion. At the theatre he met several of his boon conmrades. But the play pleased him not at all. There was a villain in it, and the villain thought he was very shrewd, and succeeded for a while ; but turned out to be a fool, and was detected and humiliated at last. So Heri-.ot cursed the play, and took some more brandy, and grew more reckless, aud became even uoisy ; so that a nurn- ber of foolish persons, who6 had really come to the theatre to see the play, cried " hush!" After a while, he and his companions left the theatre and entered a fashionable gamblin-house hard by. Hericot was generally lucky at hazard, as he " played a safe gamer" and occasionally cheated. But now, tonight, that'he really needed money, fate was against him, and he was not able to cheat. So, thinking bitterly of the rich friend, the banker, he llad this afternoon lost forever, lie departed from the grambling-house He next wended his way to a fashionable house of evil. But he failed to find peace there; and, 'having  taken still more brandy, he again departed. At last, near midnight, Hericot, in a state of semi-intoxica- tion, accompanied by two "friiends," as inebriated as himself, entered a well-known restaurant. As he descended the steps on one side of the entrance, he recognized a person whom he knew entering the restaurant on the other side. IHe cer- tainly was surprised at beholding this person,- at such a place, at such a time. Possibly our readers will be equally astonished when we inform them that the person alluded to was -none other than the Rev. George Howard! What, we hear you exclaim, a clergyman found in a restau- rant at midnight 1' Yes, and found eating oysters and drinking ale, and wherefore not? Has not a clergyman  a right to be   472        IERR'LCG, YET NOBLE. hungry and to eat? Has he not the same privilege of oysters and ale that a lawyer has, or a doctor, or a clerk? If there is allything " morally wrong " in a restaurant for a priest, then the same restaurant must be morally wrong for a layman. There is no commandment for the pastor that is not also a commandment for the flock ; there is no privilege lawful for the lattec!, that is not also allowable for the former. There is a vast deal of cant about the "duties," and " respon- sibilities," and " example," and " consistency" of ministers, which is principally talked by people who have no religion themselves, who care nothing for the church or its administrators, and who are the ones who most do themselves ,viat they would most con- demn in a clergyman. Priests are but men, and all that can be lawfully done by a man can be done by a priest. But then you exclaim, "Should not a clergyman refrain from many things not in themselves positively sinful, for the sake of example? Should he not pay a certain amount of respect to the religious prejudices of society, even if they be but preju- dices?"We answer, that this is a point to be decided by each individual priest limself. It is a matter of discretion, not con- science. And the-Rev. George Howard had, in this particular case, decided that there was nothing " out of the way " in his eating oysters and drinking ale in this restaurant. And accord- ingly he gratified his desires. Hericot and his "friends," on entering the restaurant, pro- ceeded immediately, not to the "eating-bar," where the Rev. George Howard located himself comfortably, but to the " bar" proper (or improper), where drinks were dispensed. And the trio called for brandy. And they poured out for themlselves largely, and drank copiously of the fiery liquor. Hericot's companions soon lost the little sense they originally brought with them, and became maudlin and sentimental; in- vited all- present to unite with, them, "join them," as they phrased it; seized perfect strangers -by their coat collars, and swore that. they were d d good fellows; staggered uneasily to and fro, under the impression that they were graceful and   ERRING, YET .NOBLE. dignified; used an abundance of profane language, and low, obscene slang; and performed other similar feats only attempted by those who are both "loose" and " tight." Hericot himself was well " seasoned.'"He had been a "hard drinker" for many years, and it was no easy matter for him to become intoxicated. But he lost his usual self-control to-night. He became- not exactly " drunk," but very far from " sober." Charles Singerly's name was casually mentioned by one of his companions, aud Hericot greeted the allusion to his former friend by a coarse oath, and a coarser slander. The Rev. George Howard stood not many steps distant. He had partaken quietly of his refreshment and was about to de- part, when Hericot's voice fell upon his ear. Howard, at first, almost believed that his senses must have deceived him. He himself, personally, was no admirer of Hericot; he had always avoided him, but he knew that he was intimate with Singerly, lhe had seen them together but the day before, in all the aban- don of friendship; he knew that Hericot was under infinite obli- gations to Charles. It could not therefore be possible that' the latter, even if drunk, could be so strangely, meanly inconsistent as to thus publicly insult his bosom friend. But, alas I his ears did not deceive him. There stood Hericot, coupling the name of Charles Singerly with infamy I Howard,' though  a clergyman, was still a man.   Not a mere collection of theological "isms," and a puritanical machine, but a living, thinking, feeling, full-blooded man, who had the instincts, the virtues, and, perhaps, one or two of the- infirmities of other men. Now, could any of our male read- ers stand- by quietly and hear one of their dearest friends foully abused, and yet not resent, the wrong? We think not. Neither could the Rev. George Howard.  So, clergyman as he was, (though few at that moment knew this fact, as Howard never wore the inevitable white cravat), he stepped up to Hericot and said to him, in a low, stern tone       "Sir, not even your intoxication shall allow you, or any man,   '474        ERRING, YET NOBLE. to insult my friend with impunity. And, of all men on earth, you are the last from whom I should have expected -this insult to come. Go home and go to bed, sir." Hericotd was almost sobered by his amazement. A clergyman, one of that race for whom he entertained the most supreme contempt, thus to " catechize" him, and in a public bar-rooam! He retorted in this wise: "Sir, you are a priest, and had best be at your prayers. What business have you in a bar-room? You must, yourself, be drunk to be here. I shall not measure my words to suit your taste. To bed yourself, and may it do you good.' The speaker's tone was most galling. But Howard's temper was under capital control. Ite heeded not any provocation to himself. lie smiled scornfully, and would have now with- drawn from the scene-; but Hericot, fancying that every priest was necessarily a poltroon, called after him, loudly, so as to at- tract the attention of all present: Cs Coward-damned coward ; to attempt to raise a qutrrel, and then to slink away to escape the consequences." Perhaps it-was Howard's duty as a priest to allow this con- tumely; to walk away, satisfied that his own soul exonerated him from cowardice, and rendered him superior to insult ; to act as a Quaker, or an " orthodox"Christian. All we know is, he did not depart, he did not keep silence, but he acted like a man. And, entre nous, he who is a true man mnust be a true Christian. The Rev. George Howard retraced his steps ald approached Hericot. '"I never 'slink' from consequences," he said firmly and proudly. "I am no braggart; but on the other hand, I am neither a false friend, a low slanderer, or a common bully." Hericot was astonished. 'Howard, the maln whom  he de- spised; at whom he had sneered as the " model priest ;" whom he, and those like him, regarded as a creature less than human; whom, as' the intimate of Singerly, he had formerly suspected, and now hated; this mau stood before him reliantly, almost defi- antly, and retorted to his sneers. He was, for a moment, over- *  powered. But Hericot was too inebriated to be long surprised   ^ ,g      ERRING, YET NOBLE.         475 or prudent. He was full of "wine," and what is known as "Dutch courage."  Had he been wise to-night he would have noticed the stern light in the eye of the Rev. George Howard; he would have heeded the compression of the indignant clergy- man's lips; he would have taken note, too, that Howard was powerfully built, full of muscular as of intellectual strength ; but he did none of these things ; but he did what was final, fatal and irrevocable. In his drunken fury, his conscience telling him that the words "false friend, low slanderer, and common bully," were appropriate to himself, in his intoxication and frenzy, Hericot cried, shaking his fist at the clergyman, "You are a d-- d-hypocrite, and only fit for the conmpany of Chfarles Singerly, who is a --., Our pen refuses to write the epithet he employed. And then he con. cluded with a blow-yes, the villain struck the clergyman. Now, we have presented here an excellent opportunity for moralizing. The orthodox will quote texts to prove that it was' the dutv of the Rev. George Howard to bear his blow in meekness-in fact, being thus smitten upon one cheek, to turn the other also. But these orthodox people forget that our Saviour waxed wrathful occasionally ; that St. Paul asserted his rights ; and that no where in the Bible is the doctrine taught that its disciples are to become contemptible, but exactly the reverse; besides, we may avenge  an insult offered to a friend, even if we are disposed to overlook one offered to ourselves. At any rate,- both for the indignity  inflicted  upon himself, and the insult to his bosom friend, Charles Singerly, conveyed ill the words of Henry Hericot, the Rev. George Howard, on this occasion, proceeded to administer to the said Hericot, what he richly deserved, a thoroug'oh and effectualfloggig.  . He whipped him till he cried mercy, Hericot's companions acknowledging the justice of his chastisement. This was THE clrowning disgrace of Hericot's life; detected as a forger ; cast off by a friend ; forced to kneel to a woman; and now flogged. Sarely Vengeance for the present has culminated.   476        ERBBINS  YET NOBLE. CHAPTER XIIII. IN a little while after the scenes recorded in our last chapters, an event of joy took place-the weddinu of Charles and Julia. Few persons were invited. The affair -was a private one, as all such affairs should be. Weddin gs are delicate ceremonies, and should be performed delicately. We have always been opposed to public weddings. There has been, to our minds, a certain heartlessuess, indelicacy, mock sen- timent, and even indecency, in marriages conducted with public display. The emotions of the family, the blushes and the beauty of the bride, the joy of the groom, all these should be sacred from the general gaze. And so thought Charles and Julia. Only Mrs. Singerly, Sr., Mr. and Mrs. Russell (at whose residence, of course, the mar- riage ceremony was performed), the Rev. George Howard, who performed the ceremony, Mary Barton, who was all smiles, Julia's old nurse, and five other persons, intimate friends, were present. The marriage service was performed at the house, where, ac- cording to our notions, at least, a marriage should always take place. Some think that the ceremony should tranpire at the church. This is a mistake, we think, for the simple reason that marriage being essentially a domestic affair, it should be most properly con- ducted in a domestic scene; among the associations of home; among the familiar objects which have surrounded the bride in her virgin days. But be this as it may, Julia and Charles were married at the " residence of the bride's uncle and former guar. dian," and the Rev. George Howard conducted the service in a most solemn, most befitting, and most delicately-tender manner. *   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        4" And, God knows, it is a holy anda tender thing, this marriage service. It pledges for life two human hearts. It severs them, as it were, from all other ties of earthly love, and binds them solely and purely to each other. And-it gives over the woman almost wholly to the mercies of the man. It separates the bride from her father, her mother, her sisters, her brothers; it places forever a gulf between her and the dear ones of her maidenhood it rings the knell of her departed friendships ; she has now but one in the. world, and that one her husband. Marriage, in mod- ern days, though much to the man, is infinitely more to the wo- man. She ceases, from the date of her wedding, to have a sep- arate existence ; her life becomes merged in his ; his joys are to be hers; his sorrows hers ; his wealth hers ; his poverty hers; she shares his honors, but still more must share his shame; she is t" something" to him, but he is " all in all" to her. Oh I it is a solemn thing, and yet a most tender.   For do they not vow to love each other all their lives? Do they not pledge mutual kisses, embraces, endearments? Do they not promise reciprocal affection until death?"Until death." "Aye, there's the rub" of nlarriage. To love for a while, to love for many years, even, were comparatively easy. But to love all one's life I To love when satiety has come; to love when desire has gone;, to love when long familiarity has caused a certain degree, if not of contempt, at least of indifference. This is precisely what most men cannot do, and yet it is precisely what marriage demands should be done. The only feasible way to overcome this obstacle is for no man or no woman to marry until they are thoroughly convinced in their own minds that they so love, their partners that they will never, while living, cease to love them I This condition was fulfilled in the union of Charles and Julia. Their love had stood the test of fiery trial.; death itself could not destroy it ; and thus the happiness of their marriage was secured. The service was over. They were now man and wife. Julia Witherson, whom we have so long known, had ceased to exist; she had vanished from among women, and her place was supplied by Mrs. Charles Singerly, jr.    4T:.8       :[ERRING, YET NODBLE. It was all over. Tile joy of which they had, for years, dreamed, th-e bliss for which they had so suffered and waited, had come ; they were married ; they were man and wife-none could separate them now. Charles clasped his wife in his fervent embrace and thanked his God. If ever the joys of heaven were revealed to mortals, they were laid bare at that supreme moment to our couple. "All went merry as a marriage bell." And, meanwhile, where were Henry Hericot, Esq., and Miss Katherine Somers.?  A few weeks ago, and you would confi- dently have predicted that at the wedding of Charles and Julia, none would have been more welcome guests than they. And yet this wedding has taken place, and they were not present. Of course not. People do not invite forgers and seducers to their social gatherings; people do not ask slanderers and false friends to their weddings. Henry Hericot, Esq., is at this very moment, in the classical language of "fast men," "on a spree," vainly endeavoring to drown, in wine and the smiles of  vile women, the bitter remembrance that he is a detected crimi- nal, a disappointed libertine, and a poor man; that his sins have been sheer follies-that he has been not only a villain, but a fool. While Katherine is seated in her room, cursing the success of Julia, in " carrying off" the handsome, accomplished, fashionable and celebrated Charles Singerly ; envying her wealth, and vainly endeavoring to despise the woman whom she knowe despises her. After all, reader, the, right is generally the best policy. Several hours have passed, and the newly married couple ar( together-together with " their mother," Mrs. Singerly, senior The three are locked in a triple embrace. They speak not v word, but their caresses tell volumes-their' hearts are full And in each other's arms each reviews the'past, the past fraughl with such experiences of sorrow, yet terminating in such tru( wisdom and true joy. Aye, verily, there is such a thing as X   'i             EBRRING, YET NOBLE.         479 Providence! And it had been very beneficent to them. Sweet, indeed, had been the uses of adversity.  As Mrs. Singerly looks mentally back, she sees that her past has taught her, by practical experience, the deep love entertained for her by her son ; the real worth of Julia and Julia's love; and the noble and great lesson, which she had been so slow to learn, that a woman may fall, yet rise again, may be "elrring, yet noble."  She thanks God for all her past sorrows, and feels, in her inmost heart, that " ie has done all things well." And as Charles likewise reviews the former years, lie, too, feels most thankfully that all has been ordered for the best. :Not one pang has been-borne, not even one error allowed in vain. His early sin, his youthful excesses, the passionate struggles caused by his love for Julia and the discovery of her shame ; his sud- den poverty, the equally sudden reappearance of his youthful victim ; these, and all other events of his history, have each pro- duced good and beneficent results. They have caused him to repent, to know himself and women, to purify his love, to know  better the woman who is now his wife, to expiate his own errors, to become a wiser and more prudent man, to impress upon him, indelibly, the great truth, which men seldom learn, that sin in a man is as criminal as sin in a woman ; and, lastly, to terminate in the perfect love and bliss of the present moment. As for Julia Witherson (or, as we must now style her, Mrs. Singerly, junior), words cannot express the gratitude and thank- ful emotion with which she regarded her past in connection with her present.  The whole panorama  of her history seemed un- rolled before her, and as she gazed she was ready to exclaim with the Psalmist: "Truly, Goodness and Mercy have followed me all the days of my life." Her youthful errors of religious and moral doctrine, her wild love of Henry Hericot, her fall, her desertion, her remorse, the struggles of her holier love, her noble confessions, her separation from Charles, her devotion to the reformation of her sex, her ac- cession of wealth, all these had brought her to what? Why, to   480        ERRING, YET NOBLE. true doctrine, true honor, true love, self-knowledge, knowledge of the world, practical charity and to the means of realizing it-in company with a husband of her heart, a good, true man of kindred tastes. Her sorrow, shame, and struggles had culminated at last in success, restored purity, and per- feet bliss. Yes, she, the outcast from virtue, and the aban- doned one, by love, was now the pure in the sight of God and the beloved wife of a noble man. And all the woes of the past seemed as nothing when compared with the transport of the present. Clasped in her mother's and her husband's arms, Julia, like the woman of old, "lifted up her voice and wept," but it was for joy! The mother kissed her children; the children kissed their mother; and then the children and the mother fell upon their knees and thanked God.   BOOK   A. MAN AND A WOMAN DISAPPEAR. CHAPTER I. "ONE WEDDING MAKES MANY." THERE is a good deal of truth in the popular saying which we have placed at the head of this chapter; and its reliability was illustrated in the cases of some of the personages of this history. Not- long after the wedding of Charles and Julia, recorded in our last, Miss Katherine Somers surrendered her white, well-pre- served and well-powdered charms and her immaculate virtue to the arms of an old man, but a very rich tone. She had been acquainted with this person all her life, as he was a-retired mer,- chant, whose business relations with her father had been inti' mate, but she had never shown him the least encouragement; 'in fact, she had laughed, with the rest of the world, at the idea of any marriage between herself and him. But the old fellow was persevering and rich. The father of Katherine Somers, whosp god was 'gold, and who only looked upon his daughter in the light of an investment, favored his suit. Katherine herself was foiled in her vanity, as far as Charles Singerly was concerned, and Henry7 Hericot, the only man she really cared for, was too poor to marry her.  She was filled with envy at the happiness and wealth enjoyed by her rival, Julia, to whom, since their separa- tion, she had endeavored in vain to be reconciled, for selfish and mercenary motives.  Shle  longed to  surpass  her former. friend in splendor; she was utterly destitute, as we all know,    482        rRRINGO, YET NOBLE. of any true virtue or real sentiment; and so at last she smiled upon her old suitor. Rumors became rife of a "marriage in high life." Society was agitated, and gossip was abundant. A few denizens of the "fashionable world," mostly the younger or newer comers, won- dered'at or blamed Miss Somers for her preposterous- choice; but the majority of " society awarded .her credit. "She had won a wealthy prize, she had secured a fine establishment; all honor to her, then!" So, Miss Katherine Somers; the fiancee of a millionaire, was smiled upon and congratulated, and she herself was as happy as if, by uniting herself to a money-bag, she was fulfillingn the great end of her existence. Her pet poodle died ; she buried it mag- nificently, but did not grieve too much (though she had been very much attached to it, let us give her all credit) ; she had another poodle, now, and a better one. It went upon two legs, and never barked, and it spent money on her; oh, a golden poodle I She dressed superbly, enjoyed her triumph, wore the lowest possible " low necks," the shortest possible " short sleeves," dis- played as much of herself as she could; read, in secret, all the "Ioose"French novels, was addicted to " tight" lacing, talked scandal all the week, went piously to church on Sunday, pre- pared herself magnificently for the wedding, and at last was married I The wedding was a recherchd affair, with abundance of white dresses, white gloves, bridal favors, presents, ushers, waiters, wine, feasting, kissing, toast-drinking, congratulat- ing, music, company, clergymen, groomsmen, and brides- maids. They were married in church and the reception took place in- the evening at the house of the bride's father. And the predominant sensation in the mind of the newly-made wife was that of triumph, as she thought that her wedding eclipsed even that of Julia Witherson. And yet, reader, after all, what -ceremony was it to which society, civilized Christian society, thus lent its sanction, and   EEING, YET NOBLE.   '     483 . greeted with pleasure and applause? Why, merely a cere- mony of legalized sin. Yes, do not be shocked at our plain answer, for it is the simple truth. The marriage in this case was what a great writer justly styles, "The loathsome prostitution of a hand without a heart." It was the joining of two bodies merely without their souls; it was the surrender of a woman's person to a man without- any love between the parties. It was therefore, call it by any fine name you choose, merely and essentially an act of legalized sin. Aye, of the worst kind, being ac- companied by perjury, by the taking of false oaths of love and honor i It was really in the sight of heaven the greatest of crimes, this fashionable wedding, in which two distinguished cler- gymen officiated! This may sound like strange language; so it is; like strong language, too, so it is ; but it is language as true as strong or strange. Katherine Somers, when sho married this old millionaire for his money, committed a viler act than Julia Witherson when she yielded to her love for Henry Hericot, or Fanny Walters when she erred to earn her living. I know the '" world," the fashionable world of society, does not think this, but God does I We tell you "'society" itself is but a circle of refined crime. Women .are sold as certainly and almost as publicly in America. as in Constantinople! Their parents or guar- dians sell them, or they sell themselves, but they are'sold. Sometimes pride or vanity buys them; but generally the purchasers are position or money; the latter especially. And are not women who thus sell, or are thus sold; wome-l who allow themselves to barter, or to be bartered; women who take no heed of hearts but of purses; are not the par- ties to such a transaction, are they not all we say more or less guilty? Are they not as guilty as the women who walk the streets by night-women who are more foul, it is true, but who have been far more tempted?   i 4^4       bfertm, Y ET. NOBLE. And yet, of course, a " fashionable" wife would despise a Camille. Well; heavens eyes are not like ours, heaven be thanked for it I Katherine Somers was married. Charles Singerly, his wife, his- mother, and the Rev. George Howard were. not present at the ceremony; but Hiericot was. And he was very gay. Kate Somers having become rich, he would become rich also. Kate should supply the place of Charles. So. he thought- as he took the privilege of the occasion and kissed the bride. And the bride, as she received his kiss, and contrasted his handsome face and figure with that of the old and ugly bridegroom, sighed. For if she was capable of loving any one on earth, she loved Henry Hericot. A few weeks passed, and the honeymoon of the woman whose maiden name was Katherine Somers, was already over, though that of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Singerly, jr., was still in its prime. Katherine had sold herself and had re- ceived her full price. She was mistress of a magnificent establishment, had carriaCges, etc., and wore diamonds ; but she had learned to hate her husband. But the pair managed to " keep up appearances."  Katherine was far too wise to give the world occasion to talk; and she was as pious as ever-took her husband's money and gave it to the church, and dazzled society, but was far from being happy herself. How different, and how blessedly different was it with Charles and Julia I Oh I words cannot paint the beauty and the- bliss of their united lives I We are not poets nor rhapsodists, but we tell you, reader, that neither rhapsody or poem  can adequately describe the glory and the charm of a truly martted life-- "Two souls with but a single thought, Two hearts that beat as one." Oh! how glorious is true marriage, that real, thorough, entire,. changeless union of two hearts made one! Poets   !fo EBRRINOG, YET NOBLE.                45 have sung it, philosophers have discoursed upon it, moralists have lauded it, but none yet ever have, ever will, or ever gcan adequately describe it. Michalet has conceived an idea of it in various portions of his recent great works, but even. his conception is faint of 'that perfect unity of duality which constitutes a true marriage--a marriage which sometimes though seldom, is realized upop earth; a marriage which was illustrated in the union of Charles and Julia. The Trinity is, humbly and reverently speaking, a type of real marriage. The former is composed of three persons in one God ; the latter is constituted of two bodies in one soul. There is a mystic, indescribable union in a genuine marriage which the unmarried or ill-mated man or woman can never dream of. But what a contrast to a true is a false marriage, a merely legal, worldly joining of hands and fortunes I Such a marriage as that of the coquette Katherine and her old husband I And yet there are ten marriages of the false to one of the true. Most heads of families, most married people, merely stay together- they do not live with each other I They jog along the beaten highway of existence, satisfied if they only quarrel occasionally ; content if they but keep up the appearances of affection. Most people, in fact, think they are smfficiently married,.if they .are not divorced!  Strange, but true. And we really doubt whether ninety per cent. of all modern marriages are not dead failures, except in the matter of posterity.  Meanwhile, what was Henry Hericot doing? Nothing but sinning, after the usual method.  Seeing that Singerly took no steps to expose his forgeries, he was relieved from  fear upon that score; and as regards the recontre between himself and the clergyman, only an  occa- sional allusion to it marred his peace. All attempts at recon- ciliation with Singerly were fruitless; and comment was elicited  at the evident coolness existing between the once " inseparables." But neither Charles or Hericot revealed aught.; and so the breach was but a nine days' wonder. ALnd the latter brooded upon revenge, contenting himself meanwhile with .the dissemina-   486       -ERRING, YET NOBLE. tion of such petty slanders against Singerly, Julia and Howard, 'as .he could safely utter. And he devoted himself with a new zeal to the society of his friend Katherine. Spite her marriage, he was still her most intimate friend. Katherine loved Hericot, and Hericot had long been aware of this fact. But the womani was too cold and too cunning to yield to what would have socially damned her. And the man was too intent upon other objects to devote the full power of his arts to her. Besides, she was too useful to him now in the way of business; for, in fact, she supplied to him the place formerly held by Charles- Sinerly. Before her marriage, Katherine's husband had settled upon her a-considerable sum of money. - So she was liberally supplied; and so the fashionable, accomplished Henry Hericot, Esq., who had for years subsisted principally upon the bounty of his old I' college chum"Singerly, did not now scruple to live upon the means of a woman, and that woman the wife of another man. But more than this. He absolutely employed the money obtained from the wife of one man to ruin and debauch the wife of another. Yes, not satisfied with the usual licentiousness of men of his class, he sought higher game, and determined coolly pour passer le temps, to- seduce the beautiful wife of a gentleman to whose house his social position gave him the entree. It was a resolve worthy of an irredeemable villain, and as such, eminently calculated for Henry Hericot. He set to worlk, and dealt his cards mosthadmirably. The hus- band of the lady had recently conceived the notion of becoming a politician. His political aspirations forced him to become a sort of -modern Arab-so he was but little at home. While saving his country, he neglected his family, and all this suited exactly 1Hericot's purposes. The lady herself, the wife, was a young woman of fashionable antecedents, and very beautiful, with a fragile, delicate charm, that was expressive of her character. Like many of her class, she was virtuous, simply because she had never had any temptation to be otherwise.   ERREING YET NOBLE.       487 Her principles were good, but her actions imprudent, and her mind weak. To this woman Hericot devoted himself, first under the character of her husband's friend and her attendant during his absence, but soon under the thinly-concealed design of becoming her lover. He was careful to give no sudden shock, no palpable offenlce ; but- he bided his time and called to his aid all the tact of which he was master. The lady was very much addicted to the reading of novels, and Heri- cot accordingly supplied her with all the loose French ro- mances that he could procure. She read them :with avidity, and as she was no thinker she lost her horror at their immo- rality in her admiration of their sentimental beauties. And so her principles were undermined. In addition to this the fatal facilities which fashonable life affords for the intimacy of the sexes, and the vice which results therefrom, favored the purposes of her seducer.. And so, one night, after a visit to the opera, one more mur- dered virtue cried to God for vengeance. The criminal se- cret was never discovered. The husband does not know to this very hour the fact of his dislonor. But the wife knows herself to be a blasted being. She would atone for her sin if she could, but, poor soul I she knows not how to do so. She would not have the strength of mind to fulfil any scheme of atonement, even if she had knowledge of any. She car- ties within her the fearful and unceasing plague of a guilty conscience. She is daily experiencing' the terrors " of the worm that never dieth." And the fact of the destruction ot this woman was guessed at by another wife, whose secret love for Hericot caused her to watch his movements. She even taxed /Hericot with the accusation one day. He implied its truth. And yet this virtuous Katherine, who wetnt to, church, who was shocked at the bare idea of reading Bulwer, who had a horror of all poor sinners, who considered herself infinitely more virtuous and religious than her old friend Julia; this capital wife,   488        M ,ERRIN, YET ':OBLS,            who loved another man better than her own husband, not  only did nzot interfere with Hericot's designs, but furnished him with money, though she knew that it would be em-   ployed in the basest of manners. Oh I she was an excellent  woman, this I Oh! truly; and virtuous exceedingly.  And now and here will our readers allow us a very few  words on the subject of the very fashionably, prevalent vio  lation of the Seventh commandments?  Now, do not blush or frown; such a subject as Ihia Fmust be treated of by modern social writers, for it is decidedly a : feature of modern society. This sin is very eager. Such is human nature, that the very fact that an object should not be ours, tha t by the laws  of God and Wmn it is beyond our reach, the property of another, secured by all that is human and divine, creates in  the minds of many a craving for it, and a determination to possess it. This sin, too, is very " spicy." The obstacles in its pursuit constitute its charm. True, it is not only difficult but posi- tively dangerous.  Still, spite of its danger, it is so attrac- tive that it is very general. There is much more of it than many moral people imagine; it is very, very common in very, very fashionable society; and the more fashionable the society the more common' the sin. Take New York for in- stance.  The habits of our- life here tend directly to produce an immense annual harvest of this vice, of which not the tenth part ever reaches the newspapers. One great cause of the frequency of this sin, is the compara- tive immunity from social censure insured by the customs of' society to the- offender. He runs a certain risk of injury or damages from the immediate relatives of the injured one,.but -with that exception, he is secure. Society takes no vengeance upon him; does not withhold its privileges from him. On the contrary, :he is more fted and admired by men and women thlan   IEBmRo   YET 3 NOBLlE.      &89 ever. Women and men alike in these cases blame the sin and the female sinner, but not the male criminal. But heaven sees things very differently from earth; and   : Truth often reverses the decisions of society. And in the eyes of Truth and Heaven, the man is generally a worse sinner than his victim. The fact is simply this. Though eager, spicy, and very com- mon, yet adultery is murderous and damnable.' It is the murder of domestic happiness; it is the murder of personal- purity; it is the murder of all true social life.; it is the slaughter of a soul. The wilful betrayer is, after all, nothing but a wilful murderer and if crime was justly punished in this unjust world, the one would suffer the penalty of the other. In fact, if Equity presided at'executions, both the murderer and the adul. terer would hang together; only the latter would hang the hilghest.  *   *    *    *    *  Henry Hericot succeeded in his intrigue, and was never detected, though by various parties suspected ; which suspicions were carried to his credit account by " fashionable society." Not many months after their marriage, the husband of our old friend, the former Katherine Somers, fell seriously sick. It was the opinion of his physicians that if he had received proper attention at home, he would not have died. But this may have been a mistake ;-at any rate, die he did, and was buried. Kathe- :: riue made a great display of her mourning (she looked well 'in black, it was a contrast to her fair skin), and just as soon as with any show of decency she could, she was married again,. and to Hericot. She was now rich, with her late husbandis gifts and jointures, and could afford to wed the man for whom she had always entertained an almost open affection, though she knew him. And he could now afford to marry her. Poverty no longer separated them; their mutual vices were to each other matters of no moment; and so this capitally assorted pair were united': Katherine's second union was fully as false and horribI- as her first                       ' .... 20*   4:90        EKt G, YET NOBLE'. CHAPTER II. THE THREE PANTHERS. IT is the night of the performance of a grand circus and menagerie company. They have erected an enormous booth, and fitted up its interior with trees and shrubs and painted scenes, so as to present as romantic and Eastern appearance as possible. And a large crowd are assembled, some delighted, some amused, and really but few bored. For the entertainment is certainly a more novel one than the inevitable theatres and concerts which by repetition pall upon the public taste. Lions roar, and tigers imitate their ex- mple, and hyenas howl, and monkeys and parrots chatter, ,ndl the zebra displays his stripes, and there is general variety, noise and confusion. Amongst those who lIave come to the "menagerie" to-night in search of an evening's pleasure, perhaps the merriest party stands at present admiring the magnificent plumage of some raro birds in one of the cages. The party we allude to is wholly com- posed of our old friends. There is Charles Singerly--handsome, elegant, manly. And Julia, looking magnificently ; her beam- ing face, no longer as of old, solemnly and somewhat sadly thoughtful, but full of the heart's happiness. And near lier stands the Rev. George Howard and his bride, a  late acqui- sition. And Mfary Barton and her husband, another late ditto. And they are all happy together, and form as pleasant a  party as one can set their eyes on in a menagerie or out of it.             ., And as they talk and laugh, and " look at things " together, the sounds of once familiar voices fall up on their ears. They turn their eyes in the direction, and behold --enry Hericot and He   1 -          ERRING, YET NOBLE.         491 his newly-made wife. Needless to say, neither party notices the other ; it is just anger on one side, and spite and shame upon the other.                            V- Need we say which side has the shame and which the anger    ,                .        ' As our party wander along, amidst the skillfuly-arrianged cages, surrounded with trees and encompassed with a back- ground of well-painted oriental scenery, they are borne, in imagi- nation, to the far-off countries from which the wild creatures around them have been brought. They stand before the majes- tic, tawny lion, as he stalks to and fro in his confined dominions, uttering occasionally his native thunder ; and the tiger, so beau- tiful and so fierce, who lashes his tail, or stares with his abomi- nable green eyes; and the ungainly yet majestic elephant, who rises in immensity like a monument of nature, utterly graceless, yet full of intelligence. As they gaze on these strange animals, and look at the jun- gles which are painted around them, our friends talk of India and Africa, and tales of tiger-hunts and elephant-catching, and live for a while in a world of enchantment. Now the performances begin. The audience take seats, and it so happens that Sincgerly and his friends are immediately be- 'fore Hericot and his wife. The band play ; the ponies are rid. den by the monkies; then the ponies perform on their own pri- vate account; then some gymnastic feats are gone through with by the human members of the companjy (who are not half as in- terestirn as the brutes); and, meanwhile, various rude jests are perpetrated by the professional clown of the concern, at which the "small boys" present laugh, as in duty bound ; then the huge elephant is introduced, hops around the ring on three legs, lies, down at the word of command, snorts loudly, when so requested, and steps carefully over his master; various other minor per- formances take place; and. lastly, comes the most spicy and thrilling portion of the entertainment-the appearance of a man, d  la Daniel, in the den of lions. There is always something grand in the sight of an unarmed /   man and a tiger, in the union of a man and a lion, that always interests and enchains an audience. This part of the perform- ance proceeds satisfactorily, and now comes the grand finale- the event of the evening. A very large panther has been taught to take a part in a ro- mantic drama, or rather dramatic scene. He has learned to ap- parently struggle fiercely with his keeper and attempt to devour him, and then gradually yield to the mingled strength and skill of hisopponent, and submit to his will ;the scene ending with the exhibition, on the part of the panther, of various amusing tricks. The great feature of the affail; howevel; is the filct that both the keeper and the panther appear, not'il the cae, but in the open ring or arena.   Tile man wears no armor, and lies down in the ring, and the beast, restrained by no chains or care bounds down upon him from the top of the pavilion.' This makes a very novel and spicy entertainment, and the audience are as. sured that there is not the slightest danger to themselves.  But to make assurance doubly sure, just before this part of the enter- tainment, a strong fence is erected between the ring and the spectators, so that the panther will bound on one side, while the audience remain on the other.  The attendants of the establis- ment make their appearance, and proceed  quickly and slkilfully to put up the enclosure or fence. They then retire, and the man himself comes forward, ready for his encounter with the panther. Meanwhile, the audience talk, and whisper, and suggest , in rela- tion to the coming performance.  A     few  timid ones leave the E:ii!   pavilion, but the majority remain.  Thlere isjust enough of pos- sible risk to give a  flavor to the assured np velty of the perform. ance. And now all eyes are turned upon the opezti~g in the top -  of the pavilion, from which the panther is expected to spring.* ment (such as is described in this chapter), really-was witaese   York&   ineial city. The liberty has been taken of transferring heoa to  :rstheoeale 'to New - - ?   It is a somewhat curious spectacle. The large pavilion, with its plants, trees, and trdpical scenes; the cages, filled with all manner of strange birds and beasts; while the air is loaded with an endless variety of noises, mingled with the music of the band; and in the distance towers the form of the ungainly ele- phlant, swaying his trunk to and fro; and not far from thence is the skilfully-painted jungle, where, in'their concealed cages, the lion and the tiger glare lazily upon the audience, -who, 'arrayed in their modern vestments, sit, looking upwards, waiting for the wild beast, who is to spring upon the man in oriental garb lying in the arena. The audience wait to see the panther, and they see him ; but not in the way they expect or desire. God only knows what original thoughts or ideas entered the panther's brain that night; but we do know this: a sudden roar is heard, a dark form cleaves the air, and the panther descends, not upon his keeper, but-among the audience I Instead of bounding perpendicularly, the beast makes a spring at a wide angle, falls on the wrong side of the fence, and alights, as luck will have it, in the middle passage or aisle of the audito. rium. Having alighted there, with bristling hair, wild fierce eye, supple form, and low, horrible roar, he prepares to spring   upon the terrified  human beinge around him.    All his training is forgotten ; his native, fierce instincts are aroused ; he dreams, possibly, he is again in his wild eastern home ; he is no longer a "performing .animal," but a genuine panther. Words cannot adequately express the consternation and con- fusion of the audience. Shrieks rend the air from all quarters; persons far removed from all proximity to the danger are as ter- rified and as noisy as those in the immediate neighborhood. Wo- men faint (of course, just at the moment they should be most active and self-possessed), and men lose, in the shock, all their sex's courage (of course, just at the moment when it is most needed). All sense of propriety is lost; the mad instinct of self- preservation reigns supreme. In the tumult several are braised, even seriously wounded,  and a young child is absolutely crushed    i)*        ERRING, YET NOBLE. to death. The band ceases to play, and the lions and tigers in their cages, moved by the tumult, comm'ence to roar. and howl. Henry Hericot, who, with his wife, was seated close to the spot on which the panther alighted, is struck with terror. He displays in this supreme moment, his supreme cowardice and meanness. Forgetful of his wife, who trembles at his side mindful only of himself, he leaps absolutely over the heads of those behind him. Only when at a considerable distance from his original location, does he pause to look at his escaped dan- ger, or to think of his abandoned wife. Julia and Charles, who are close to the panther, clasp each other in their loving arms. The rest of their party, though they endeavor to escape (which is impossible, owing to the press of the multitude), evince no unworthy fear. But Mfrs. Katherine Hericot; nee Somers, is left to face her fate and the panther alone. And it certainly seems as though the panther has deter- mined to claim her for his prey; as if the beast has, after a survey of the audience, singled out her particularly for him- self. Is it because both the beast and the woman are alike beautiful and treacherous? At any rate, the panther fastens his wild, dread, terribly-fascinating eye upon the shrinking Katherine, who lacks even the  strength to call upon the heaven she has so long pretended to worship, and who bit. terry feels in her heart of hearts that even her husband has deserted her. As   she stares, the beast glares and crouches, and then prepares for a  final spring. A dizziness comes I over her; her heart ceases to beat; her eyes become dimmed;  a  cold sweat seizes her; she gives herself up for lost; she fancies the maddened beast clutching at her throat. But no, the fatal spring is not made. At the eleventh hour a man comes to her relief. A   form rushes forward and di- verts the attention of the panther who prepares for this new enemy. It is the Rev. George Howard who has caused this diversion. And now the spell of terror is broken, and soon the clergyman, and the keepers, and attaches of the estab- lishment, who by this time have been gathered together,   ERRINg, YET NOBLE.        495 and are prepared for action, secure, at their own imminent peril, the enraged beast. The danger is over! 8      s * * $   $  A man who fears his God does not fear men,or beasts, peril or death. The Christian is seldom a coward-vide the Rev. George Howard. -The man who does ciot fear his God, generally does fear something or some one far less wortlhy. The blasphemer is generally a poltroon-vide Henry Hericot. After the panther had been secured, the sneaking Hericot rejoined his wife, who, from that moment, began, for the first time in her life, to despise him. But just as he was on the point of returning to her, a Hand was laid upon his arm; and looking up, he recognized the frowping face of Fanny Walters. "Villain i" she hissed through her set teeth into his unwill- ing ear, " you remember my warning when we last met." Ie did, indeed, remember. It flashed across his mind vividly the memory of her words when he last saw her. She had then promisedto- watch him ; and if lie sinned more she had vowed to take vengeance upon him.  His guilty fears agitated him ; but he spoke not, and she continued: "I have watched you; I know all; I have been on your track ; I know your last victim" (mentioning to Hericot's utter astonishment, the name of the wife whom he had be- trayed); "nothing can cure you but death; you must be damned yourself, or you will damn others. This is your second warning; your third will be your last for ever. Arthur Ha- milton, Henry Hericot, betrayer, adulterer, murderer, cow- ard, beware, you have escaped one panther, but you will find ere long that a maddened, vengeful woman is a panther from whom there is no escape." She ceased; he looked around; he had not lost a word; *l    4B      -   RRiNGs, Y3ET NOBLE. but he had not dared to raise his eyes; and now she was gone. The panther proper, the wild brute beast, was by this time safely secured. Panther second, the fair but treacherous Katherine, now subdued and agitated, was recovering from her recent shock; and panther the third, the most beautiful, most fierce, and most dangerous of all, Fanny Walters, had disappeared. But in his dreams that night, of all the three panthers, Henry Hericot dreamt of the third one most 1   - -BRING), YET MoBL.      :47 C C-I APTER   III. 1      A DIALOGUE AND A DREAM. ONE morning, a few days subsequent to the events record- ed in our last, Mrs. Katherine Hericot, tempted by the beauty of the weather, sallied out, gorgeously arrayed, for a promen- ade upon Broadway. She went alone, for her husband had not yet risen, though it was full noon. He had been on a debauch the night previous, and was " sleeping off" the effects. He had tired somewhat of his wife already, and she had quarreled with him, having reproached him for his recent cowardice. And so Mrs. Katherine Hericot sallied forth on her solitary promenade, conscious that she looked well, and was well dressed. She walked gaily and proudly on, and soon was in the midst of a crowd of fashionable promenaders like herself. But she experienced an extraordinary interruption. A woman passed her, seemed to recognize her, turned, joined her, and, touching her on the sleeve, said, abruptly, "I wish to speak with you." Mrs. Katherine Hericot, astonished, looked at the woman keenly. The stranger was richly dressed, beautiful, too, undoubtedly, with superb charms which filled Mrs. Hericot with a momentary sentiment of envy. For every pretty woman by instinct hates another. But the stranger had an indescribable air, an indefinable something in her look and manner, which a woman of Katherine's description would understand as quickly and as thoroughly as a man. And, struck by this, Mrs. Hericot, having recovered from her sur- prise, addressed the stranger thus : "Who are you?"   "8        ERRING, YET NOBLE. The words were uttered with a curled lip. The stranger noticed the sneer and the sharp tone, and replied- "My name is Fanny Walters, and I am     what you imagine." And the speaker looked full in the face of her companion. "' "What do you want with me?" asked Katherine, with a movement expressive of disgust. , How dare you address me! Leave mne."  "Not till I have spoken io you concerning your husband.' "My husband!" repeated Katlerine in astonishment. "Yes, your husband, Arthur Hamilton, or Henry Hericot. I would speak to you of him." This dialogue took place in the street. Katherine grasped the "situation." If she walked with this strange creature, attention would -be excited. On the other hand, she ardently desired to hear what the woman had to say. She looked around. They were, at this moment, near the entrance of a large lookin,-glass establishment, in the lower story of which was an "art-gallery ;" it would be better there than in the streets. "Follow me," she cried to her companion; and, seeing first that she was not observed, Katherine Hericot entered the "art- gallery," followed by Fanny Walters. "And now, what have you to tell me of my husband?" asked Katherine. The gallery was deserted at the present moment; the two women were its only occupants. "He is a villain?was the emphatic rejoinder of Fanny Walters. "He is a liar, a perjurer, a seducer, a heartless cheat." Alas I the wife, in her own secret heart, felt that this woman spoke the truth concerning her husband. But her lips said-- "How dare you speak thus to me, woman?" "I dare anything--I dare tell this to the world; for I can prove it." "What has my husband done to you, that you should talk of him thus?"  ' X   ERRING, YET NOBLT,.         ;9 "What has he done to me? God I you ask me this I He has murdered mue." "W hy, you stand before me alive." "Yes, but my happiness is dead; my honor is murdered; and he, your husband, has ruined me, body and soul, forever. You understand me?" Aye, her' listener understood her meaning  thorougllly. Katherine Hericot had known her husband to be  A libertine before she married him. She turned to Fanny Walters and asked- "And why do you tell this to me, woman? What is all this to me?" "Ah! you are just the woman to be the wife of such a vil- lain. You two are a well-matched pair."' This was too much for Katherine's patience. "Such words," she exclaimed, with a look and tone of the utmost scorn, " and from such a creature!" "Aye," retorted Fanny Walters, proudly and bitterly, " and yet this ' creature' is, in the sioht of heaven, a purer and a truer woman than such as thou. Aye, draw up your proud form and cast upon me looks of would-be indignant virtue ; but again I tell you that, in the eyes of truth and God, sinner as I am, I am less sinful than thou. I fell througch love ; you sold yourself for gold. I sin through necessity, because I have no choice; you have erred without necessity and without temptation. You encourage and practice all kinds of vice, so that it be but fash- ionable; I am a living warning against it. You hide your sillns under the cloak of an abominable hlypocricy; I am at least open and honest in my wickedness. I know that the world, comparing us together, would cast its verdict in favor of you, the hypocrite ; but as sure as there is a final judgment, so surely will He render judgment in favor of me, the sinner." She spoke these words boldly. And in her secret soul, Kathe- rine Hericot felt their truth. She remembered her last conversation with Julia Witherson, and the plain facts that were told her then. Her conscience, which slept on the average three hundred and sixty-three days out of the three hundred and sixty-five, now   -'00 ;      ERBNET', YET NOBS. B. awoke for a moment, and told her that what she heard then and now were solemn facts. She was silent for a space. It was a peculiar situation. The quiet, deserted art-gallery, so contrasted with the noisy world outside ; in its midst the two women, both beautiful, and opposed in their beauty; both richly attired, and contrasted in their attire-the woman of the fashion, and the woman of the street; their faces expressive of their feelings, of shame and triumph.           . :i But Katherine Hericot recovered herself, and was again the a cool, shrewd hypocrite. Besides, she feared to carry on this  interview further. They might be, at any moment, interrupted or overheard. She said : "Woman, have you anything to tell  me?  Abuse of myself or my husband-is this all you have to utter?" Then her curiosity pressing upon her irresistibly, she  asked-"How do you know anything concerning us?"      '" "I met Arthur Hamilton, my betrayer, or rather, Henry  :S Hericot, your husband, in the house where I live, in the hell  where I make my home.   It was the first time we had met  since he had deserted me. He would have renewed his arts upon me; but I drove him from   me.  And I warned him n  And since then I have made it the business of my life to watch him, and all connected with him. I know all his recent move- ments; all your history; all the history of the unfortunate woman, the wife, whom, with your knowledge, he ruined before : he married you. I have followed him-; I have inquired concern- I -ing him; I have set spies upon him ; I have given my time and  money to the search ; I have set my wits to work. And I know all. I have seen you and he together, while you were still the I wife of another; I have watched him in the streets and in the  theatres with the wife of his friend. I have guessed all. I know all." "And wherefore have you watched him thus V1" "Because I  have sworn to myself and him to do so." "And wherefore do you tell met his wife, this?" "Because, if you care for him, if you love him, (if such as you can love), you will warn him.". "Against what?"   ERRING, YET NOWLE.         501 "Against further lies, sins, amours ,intrigues. Against mak- ing more such victims as myself. For: as surely as he sins again- with woman, so surely will he die, and by a woman's hiand-by mine"      ,  "You will kill him, then?" "I will take justice on him. Not for myself, but for my sex. I have forgiven him. I spared him. But I warned him that if' he murdered more women, -- should avenge them and save oth- ers. Aye! I would end his life las one would destroy a serpent, and with as little remorse. Siee^y warning he has sinned once; and you were his accomplice. Y'ou knew that he sought to betray the wife of his friend ; yet you saved her not--but amiled upon him. I met hn a few/nighlts since; that night he played the coward, and left you tothe panther. I warned: himt again; and now I tell you that if he sins, he dies. Tell him so for me, and watch him that he errs not ; for, as sure as there is a God or a devil, if he slays more wonmen, I shall slay him." Strange words these for ode fashionably-dressed woman to address to auother in an art-gallery; but passion knows nag etiquette. Katherine Hericot stood for a moment overwhelmed, as it were, by the solemn vehemene of her companion, whose frame dilated, whose- eyes flashed, and whose: magnificent arm was raised threateningly. But the former soon recovered her self. possession, and said to te latter, with a show of boldness: "Do y ou know that yo are placing yourself in my power? that I can have you arrested for your murderous intentions?" "Do so. I will thenexpose you both, and, spite of all laws and all precautions, will 'dog his footsteps till we meet, and then kill him. Arrest me.; and it will seal your shame and his death. And now I leave/you.  Mine is no idle threat, as he may yet find. Let him then beware of women, or die by woman'. The woman of the town warns the man of the, town.

Katherine Hericot stood in the quiet. art-gallery alone. She seemed like one who had just awoken from a dream ; for all that bad happened was so far removed from the ordinary experience of life that, at first, she almost persuaded herself that she had been in a day-dream, a trance. But this delusion soon vanished. She felt that she had been ill the real presence of a desperate woman, justly. infuriated against her husband ; and that she had received for him an awful warning. Memories of tragedies in real life, in which women had slain their betrayers, rushed upon her mind, and she trembled.    - ... ' She hastily left the artgallery, descended :the stairs, passed out into the gay sunshine, and, walking 'hastily through the thronged streets, neglectful of the smiles of iler numerous fash- ionable acquaintances, reached her blomne, but found her husband absent. Since her departure from the house, he had risen and gone out, having left word with the servants that he would not return until late at night. And yet this pair had been only a few weeks married. The day wore on; and evening came upon the earth. The wife partook in silence of her sumptuous but lonely dinner, and then retired to her room. She waited there till midnight; and, at last, her husband returned. He had evidently been drinking deeply ; was not exactly intoxicated ; but certainly out of humor. He met his wife gruffly, exclaiming: "Well, why do you wait up-for me in this manner? I do not come home any earlier on your account, do I?" Indeed, he did not. But Katherine forbore answer or com- plaint. She merely told him all that had transpired in her inter- view with Fanny Walters, and besought him, if he would not for love restrain his sins, at least to do so for fear. The intelligence sobered Hericot., He affected to care noth- ing about the matter, mocked at his wife, and laughed at her re- quests. But when he retired, his face told a far different tale his guilty soul was agitated with aWcoward dread. He was fright- ened as well as astonished at his victim's knowledge of his recent movements; and he felt that the words she had spoken to his   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        503- wife to-day were terribly earnest ones. His conscience troubled him with a pang that was as sharp as it was rare. But toward morning he fell into a sleep ; and in this sleep he dreamed. He saw a jail, a prison-van, and a crowd of men and& boys. From out the van came a convicted thief, who, for some petty larceny, was to be confined in the jail. And, as the man stepped forth, guarded by the officer, the crowd around laughed at him, jeered him, called him thief; and the cup of his degradation was quaffed to its very dregs. Again, he saw in his dream a magnificently-furnished room; and seated in that room a man and a woman. The woman-was beantiful, young, and confiding; and she was. listening blushingly to the man, who, skilled in all the arts of fascination, was bending over her. The man tempted- the woman fell. Then the scene suddenly changed to a gorgeous club-room, and there sat this very young man, narrating his victory over the woman.  His comrades applauded and caressed him; Hericot tried to get a glimpse of the young man's face, and, lo I it was his own. Again, he saw in his dream a gallows erected in a public place, and on the gallows swung lifeless in the air the body of a man ; and lo I the man, was the same criminal who had been seen awhile since entering the jail from the prison-van. From a thief he had become a murderer; and this was the end of the assassin. Then he saw in his dream a young man who was sur. rounded by gay companions, and was in the midst of revel, suddenly stabbed to the heart by a woman; and lo! the man 'was the same he had just/seen in the luxurious parlor ; was, in,short, himself; while the woman seemed the same as she who had then been betrayed; and suddenly her face was turned full upon him; and lo I it was the angry face of Fanly Walters. Such was the end of the seducer. Lastly, he saw in his dream a vast space; in this space were a host of men and women; a majestic Presence, balf.   50ac       zRrlNr , YET NOBLE. cloud and half. light, was seated on a, throne to judge the people,; and among the people stood the young: man (thie- seducer, Hericot himself) and the criminal (the thief and murderer), and the woman, with a face like Fanny Walters. The Judge turned to the criminal who had died upon the gallows, and sentenced him to further punishment in the world to come. And then the Judge turned to the woman, and, for her too easy yielding, and her too furious vengeance, likewise doomed her to a certain term of retribution. Yet He still held out to them both the hope that, as they had been sorely tempted and had terribly suffered upon earth, they might, in the lapse of ages, be restored: to happiness and heaven. But, then; with an awful frown, and a voice of angry thunder, the Judge turned Him to the last of the three, Hericot himself, and he sentenced him to eternal perdition and the most fearful tdrments. His doom was ten times more horrible than that of his two companions. And when he complained of this, the Judge cried to him, in accents that tolled the knell of all hope, "Thy sin is ten times more abominable than theirs;- and thou didst not suffer aught on earth. Every blessing was continuously showered upon thee, and thou didst persistently abuse them all. Thou wast not tempted as these thy companions were; and yet thou didst spend thy life in tempting others. TIhet woman was a passive sinner; thou wast the active devil. The: murderer did but kill the body, but thou, with abominable artsi and thy long, selfish, luxurious, godless life} hast killed a host of souls. Depart for ever into outer darkness." Hericot awoke"; but was it al a dream.? *   R RB2ING, YET NOBLE. *      5 CHAPTER IV. ( VENGEANCE IS MNE; I WILL REPAY, SAITH THE LORD." HENRY HERICOT arose early the next morning. It promised to be a beautiful day; and as his fears vanished, he laughed at his own terrors ; he felt a man. again. Why should he be frightened at a woman's words? His exaltation was as great as his recent depression. He determined not to surrender his amours, but only carefully conceal them, so that Fanny Walters should not be able to trace them. "Meanwhile," soliloquized he, "I will find a way of getting rid of that Fanny; and until I have succeeded in this object, why, I will betake myself to the country and hunt my game in the 'rural districts.' By the bye, I will commence my agricultural schemes this very day.  I will seek out that pretty little country girl I met last summer at C and who took such a  fancy to me I I shall reap the benefits of her penchant. I will tell that jealous wife of mine I am going out of town for a few days on business. Capital idea. Now, Fanny Walters, catch me this time if you can. Not that I believe the girl would hurt me after all. She is merely jealous and wants to frighten me. But in vain. -Vive la bagatelle." So humming a   lively opera air, Hericot took his breakfast, made his excuses to his wife with cool indifference, and de- parted. He  reached the little village of C-- and under a  spe- cious pretext and an assumed name, took up his abode at the inn. He visited the neighboring farmers; was hospitably received, met the girl of whom he was in search, cast his coils about her, lied, swore, protested, quoted poetry, sang, 2   506     ]  ERRING, YET NOBLE.- talked of city life, dazzled, bewildered, and at last ruined her. He-was an adept at this sort of thing ; and 'having accomplished his purpose, in less than a fortnight (when a woman loves and is weak it does not take -many days to damn her), he returned to the- city, and to his wife, as gay as ever. "I have oitwitted my wrathful 'Fanny,' as she styles herself, this time at all events." So he said, but did he do so? It is a very difficult thing to outwit a woman who has once had her eyes opened. Hericot found the city very lively on his return. The sea- son was at its height, and he plunged, with renewed zest, after his rural sojourn, into metropolitan gayeties. He was invited to all the leading fashionable parties, and as he was a perfect dancer, never lacked for partners. He was regular in his attendance on his " club," and as a brilliant conversa- tionist, was always welcome. And so he enjoyed his butterfly existence. After all it is a very pleasant life, that of the male human butterfly. To rise at a luxuriously late hour; to partake of an excellent breakfast; to array one's valuable person in expen- sive and comfortable garments; to promenade with one's fashionable friends the fashionable streets, exchanging bows, and compliments, and salutations, and hearing and uttering pleasant gossip and light scandal; to while away the hours at billiards or cards; to feast on capital wines and French dishes ; to pay visits ; to attend the theatre or opera nightly; to patronize balls and to shine at parties ; to have all your surroundings at home and abroad luxurious, artistic, elegant and costly; to be one of the favored few who neither toil or spin yet who reap all the rewards of labor which they never perform; to have existence all sunshine ; to idle and to sin, yet suffer none of the penalties of sin or idleness. Ah 1 this is a charming career? And such was the life. of the rich, fashionable, handsome, accomplisbed, admired, success- ful Henry Hericot.    ERRING, -YET NOBLE.       507 Oh I it sometimes tempts one to believe that, as the poet says, "There are no gods in heaven" when we see such worthless men leading such enviable lives I But there is an, old and wise proverb, "Count no man happy till his death." One night a new actress was announced to make her debut at the ---theatre, in the character of Camille. The debutante was said to be charming and gifted, and there was a certain romance connected with her story. She was of a fashionable and wealthy family, and adopted the stage without any pecuniary necessity on her part, and against the wishes of her family, actuated solely by the love she felt for the dramatic profession. Of- course the management of the theatre made the most of this romantic capital, and, by skilfully worded "cards" in the papers, and " on dits" in the fashionable journals, excited quite a " sensation" in the public mind concerning the appearance of this " rara avis." Consequently on the night referred to the theatre was crowded by a refined audience such as generally patronized the opera. Charles Singerly and wife were there in full dress. The Rev. George Howard and his wife were also present, as likewise were our old acquaintance, Mary Barton and her husband. There was, in the language of the bills, "a full and fashionable house." Of course Hericot was there, accompanied (not, of course,) by his wife, who looked very charmingly, and smiled upon her numerous acquain- tances (all saving her old friend Julia) with the greatest suavity. After the usual amount of orchestra and overture, the cur- tain rose upon "Camille," and the young debutante made her appearance., She was very warmly greeted, partly by the audience in genuine kindness, partly and principally by the "claquers" attached to the theatre, who applauded because it was their business to do so. She was young and handsome, with dark eyes, dark hair, and dark complexion, and, there- fore, looking more like a Jewess than a. French girl. She played her part well, however, like one who had studied the   508       ERRING, YET NOBLE. character thoroughly, and she satisfied the audience. Still, her delineation of "Camille" lacked nature. There was art and plenty of it, there was feeling, and beauty; and a musical voice, and grace of movement, but, then, it needs more than all these to constitute a true Camille. It requires, in fact, an experience, a personal experience or observation of the, sins and sorrows of the world of women, which few young women, or women whose lives, like that of the debutante, have been passed in " the charmed circle of society," can attain to. But be this as it may, the new " star" ascended the theat- rical firmament in glory ; was the cynosure of all eyes, and the theme of all tongues. She was " called out" at the end of each act, and received the usual quantum of bouquets, two out of three of which were, of course, bestowed by the regular agents of the theatre. Hericot was quite delighted with the new " star," and spoke of her enthusiastically to his friends in the lobby. During the interim, between the second and third acts, he and a number of his fast friends adjourned to a fash- ionable drinking saloon in the neighborhood of the thea- tre, and partook freely of stimulating liquors. He had previously been in high spirits; he now became the centre of attraction. He jested and laughed, and seemed the soul of merriment. "How I do envy you, Hericot," said one of his friends. "What do you do that foolish thing for, Harry?" replied Hericot. "Why," answered Harry, "you have led such a jolly life all the time. Your career has been one of a thousand; nothing to do since the day you were born and everything to enjoy.  You were petted when a child; you shirked all work at school; you mapaged to obtain "honors" at college without striving for them; or, to tell the truth, deserving them; you were never rich yourself, yet you have always had rich friends, and enjoyed all the advantages of money; you /V UYIJ' V   ELRRING YET NOBLE.        509 have always lived svell, dressed well, and had'as much sport as any five men I know of; you have been most devilish suc- -  cessful with the women, every girl you meet falls in love with you ; and yet, though you are everlastingly engaged in intrigues, you never yet have compromised yourself, or got into a scrape; you are handsome; you can talk money out of a man, and the heart out of a woman ; you can sing, dance, play the piano, beat nine men out of ten at billiards, are always lucky at cards, can hold more wine than any other man, can eat more than most; never have headaches are never sick, have the best of credit everywhere, though you never pay   Dam'me, Hericot, your whole life has been all couleur de rose. While other men have had their cloudy moments, your existence has been all a gleam- of sunshine which has lasted for twenty-nine years." "My dear Harry," with a laugh replied Hericot, "' how elo- quent you are. I really never knew how happy and lucky I have been till now." "Oh, laugh if you choose; you know you have been a d d sight more lucky than you deserve," persisted his companion. "I don't know about that, after all," interrupted a third; "Hericot deserves all he has managed to get; for he under- stands human nature and the world, and has always made it a rule to use them both as suits his own purposes." "That I can endorse," cried a fourth. "And I," "and I," cried a fifth and a sixth. "Well, gentlemen," said Hericot, " since you seem to insist upon it, I confess that I do understand what it pleases you to denominate as the ' world' and ' human nature.' I also con- fess to the soft impeachment of using'them both to accomplish my own purposes. In this I only follow the. example of every other man of sense who has ever lived." "Bravo, old fellow," interrupted one of his companions; "I like your candor and your creed. Down with all old fogy notions of principle, honor, religion, and all that cant, say I. My motto is, each for himself and the devil take the hindmost.'    5!0        ERRING, YET NOBLYE . This noble avowal was hailed in all quarters with enthusiasm; and the conversation now turned upon the folly of religion. "Damn the priests and their Bibles," cried Hericot; "what do people in the nineteenth century want with religion? It did well enough for the old times ; it may do well enough even now for the 'rural districts'; but men of the world know. better than to be deceived by it. As far-as I am concerned, I have never been able to satisfy myself that there is even any God. I can see no signs of Him ; and I can't see of what use he is-except to frighten old women. Of course, we all think thus. We would not say so to everybody ; for we must humbug the world, if it insists upon being humbugged ; but I know that on this matter men of sense cannot have two opinions. There is either no God or he is of devilish little use in His own world. But come," he, continued, with a fashionable oath, "let us take one glass more round, and then to the theatre-for the third act must have al- ready begun." The " one glass more round" was taken. "Here's to the new star of the theatrical world, whose ascen- sion we have to-night witnessed." "Bumpers, gentlemen, bumpers." And the toast was drank with all the honors. "My word for it, gentlemen," cried one, "Hericot will be the favorite satellite of this new star before the month is out. I saw him watching-her with a smile all the performance. And I know what that means with him." The man was right.- Hericot, in his own mind, had determined to try his arts as soon as possible upon the debutante of the evening.  She was too tempting game to be allowed to pass by without a shot. "And now for the theatre," cried the group of "fast" friends. And they accordingly went thither. Standing at one of the doors Hericot recognized his valet- leaving his friends he approached his servant and said: "Well, Thomas, what is it? Why are you here?  Do you wish to see the play?"   EBRING, YET NOBLE.1 1 To Hericot's credit be it stated, that, singularly enough, he I was always polite, sometimes even kind, to his servants, who were, on their part, much attached to him. It is singular that a man so systematically selfish and thoroughly heartless should display such a trait as this. But human nature is full of remarkable in- consistencies. "No, sir-thank you, sir," replied the valet, Thomas,--"or at least I should like to see the play ; but I came to give you this note, which was left at the house a few minutes after you had started for the theatre. The man who gave it to ume told me to hand it to you as soon as possible. So, as I knew where you were, I thought I would brinmg it to you, sir." "You have done rigoht, Thomas," replied his master- taking the letter,--" and here is a ticket. You can stay and see the play ." "Thank you, sir," said the valet, and wended his way to the entrance to the gallery. Hericot opened the letter and read it. And, as he read, his face flushed with triunlph. The letter contained glorious news. A distant relative of his, whom he had not seen for years,-of whom he had scarcely heard, on whom even he, calculating as he was, had never thought of calculating, had died out in Cali- fornia, having accumulated a large fortune. Tills (as he had died without a will, and as Hericot was nearest living heir,) would fall to the lot of Hericot himself. It was valued at nearly a million of dollars. This good luck staggered the recipient ; he rushed to the near- est drinking-saloon; and swallowed a draught of brandy. He then re-read the letter ; it was all as has just been said. He would soon be the possessor, sole and uncontrolled, of nearly i million of dollars. "Good God 1" he cried, (even he, who said that he did not believe in a God), " what a freak of fortune 1" He could not, at first, comprehend the full extent of his new wealth ; but he knew the value of money, and he soon appreci- ated his "luck" at its full extent. He returned to the theatre.   And. as he, walked through the lobby, and gazed at the crowd within, many of whom he knew iutimately, he felt as though he were a kings--a prince among his fellows. He saw Julia seated in one of the boxes. 'f Ah," thought lhe, "now I shall be able to gratify my revenge upon her, her husband, and their clerical friend. I can outshine them all, and fill their hearts with envy. I can make the prond Julia wish that she had been more kind to me of late. I shall show Singerly that I am independent of his gold and far above it. Perhaps I may be able yet to defy him and to have my full revenge. For  wealth can do anything, and I am rich, thanks -to my relative, who was kind enough to go to hell,before his time to accommo- date me.  As for that canting Howard, I shall be even with him yet; I shall play a sort of Macheth to his Banquo, and shall hire me some strong fellows to beat him as he once beat me.  Ah, money, money t How gay I shall be I I have many  years before me, and a million in my possession I I shall travel, drink, flirt, eat, sleep, hate whom I like, say and do as it seems to me best, and, above all, no woman shall be able to resist me and my million.  I never have had much trouble with the sex; I shall now have even less. Damme, I have always said there was no God.   I am mistaken. There is a good-natured God  somewhere, and I must be one of his favorite prophets. Nothing can resist me now. I shall commence my new career to-night; -shall form this new actress' acquaintance, and then-well, shall I not be irresistible? Am I not worth almost a million?',  So ran the mental soliloquy .of Henry Hericof, Esq. But now the curtain fell upon the third act, and several of his "friends" strolled into the lobbies. "Why, where on earth have you been during this last half hour?" they cried. Hericot explained to them his late good news, and his heart swelled with pride as he saw the envy and the admiration he excited amongst his acquaintances. "Damme," cried the man who had, a little while before, extolled Hericot's good fortune, ," nothing surprises me in the way of chance happening to you. If you were to be made a king, I should say it was perfectly natural. I respect. -   fully move that from this time he be known as King Heri- cot." And "King Hericot " he was accordingly called the remain. der of the evening. But all history proves to us that even "kings " must die I Soon the performance of  Camille" drew to a close; and the audience began to disperse. Hericot, who seldom played the part of cavalier to his w"lfe, but trusted her to the politeness of her acquaintances, finding that Katherine had secured an escort, was on the point of" excusing " himself, so that he might prosecute his designs upon the actress of the evening. Charles Singerly and wife, the Rev. George Howard and wife, and Mary Barton and husband, were chatting pleasantly together as they neared the exit doors. The lobbies were filled with the depart-. ing hundreds hurrying outwards, and there was a -general hum of voices and tread of many feet, and rustlings of hundreds of silks..                              i When, suddenly there was- a tumult in the crowd, a rushing noise, a groan, a shriek, general exclamations of surprise and  X horror, and intense excitement. "' What is the matter yonder?" asked a man in the crowd,    i who was standing at some distance from the centre of excite-   ^ ment, of a person more favorably situated to learn what whsa'   '  going on. "A woman fainted? Any one robbed?-or what?"     / "No,' was the reply; " none of these. A murder has been committed, I believe. A woman has stabbed a man."         i It was even so. An hour or two after the affair, two gentle. { men, who had been present at the time, were talking of the mat- i ter. "I was just advancing," said one of the gentlemen in ques- / tion, " towards the middle exit door, with my wife on my arm,  I when I suddenly saw a woman rushing through the crowd. She   X was tall and fine-looking, but seemed like a tioress, as she darted g towards this man, and then I heard her hiss distinctly in his ear, ' You have been warned twice, and sinned twice. You thought the country would conceal your last offence, and so you will sin again. But thus I avenge my sex and myself,' or words to     22*    514        ERRING, YET N OBLE. that effect. For, of course, as you may suppose, the whole affair was so terribly strange, that I cannot vouch for the exact lan- guage." "And what did the man she addressed do-?" "He seemed stricken, like a guilty thing. He turned as white as a sheet, and trembled visibly. No doubt he had injured this girl, and deserved all he received. At any rate, before any of the spectators could interfere, before they had even fully com- prehended her strange words, she raised her arm (and a beauti- ful arm it was), and we saw a dagger gleaming. We then di- vined her purpose, and several gentlemen rushed towards her to stay the descent of the murderous weapon. But in vain. They were too late. She stabbed him mortally. He fell, exclaiming, ' Hell, she has kept her word 1 " "' Depend upon it, this fellow was a bad man, and, after all, only met the fate which he deserved, and from the hands of one of hs own victims, most probably. What was his name?" "Henry Hericot, I am told. He was a married man and a very ' fast fellow.'-" "Did he die instantly?" "Yes." "And what* was the name of the woman?" "She gave her name as Fanny Walters. She was once a decent girl; but has, for some years, been a woman of the town." ' And this man seduced her, I suppose ; and made her what she is?"  "So she says." "Then, by G--d, the fellow deserved to die like a dog  And I cannot find it iu my heart to blame the woman." ' Nor. I." So talked two strangers late on the night of the murder of Henry Hericof. But there were some things connected with the affair which few or none knew or can know, save ourselves I   and our readers, and God, who seeth all things.

They could see the theatre lobbies deco- ated with pictures; the bright gas-light, and the gayly-dressed crowd, mingling in the noisy street outside. They could behold the woman, Fanny Walters, spring forward and raise the dag- ger; and several gentlemen, among whom was Charles Singerly, rush forward to stay her hand, but in vain. They could behold a man, the Rev. George Howard, receive the form of the mur- dered Hericot as he fell, and exclaim, as he gazed upon him, "God, have mercy upon his soul, for he has perished in his sins." They could also behold a woman, Katherine Hericot, nee Som. ors, utter a piercing shriek, and fall senseless into the arms of those around her; and several other ladies, among whom were Mrs. Charles Singerly, and she who was formerly Mary Barton, evince an extraordinary interest in the scene. They could also see the tall form of the murderess, with the bloody dagger still in her hand, gazing, with hate and triumph and yet with a latent pity and a not wholly buried love, upon her victim. But they could not fully appreciate what we know: and this is, that Henry Hericot was murdered by one of his victims, in the hour of his pride of success and fortune, and that two other of his victims were present when he received his retribu- tion. For not only she who. was once Julia Witherson, was near to Hericot in the crowd when he was struck ; but not far from Julia stood also, gazing in horror, the wife of Hericot's friend, whom he had dishonored. She, too, had come to witness Camille to-night, and had witnessed a tragedy in real life. Was it not one of those coincidences which sometimes take place, that thus, at the moment he least expected, fate should fall upon the villain, by the hand of one whom he had injured, in the presence of two others, from whose hands he merited a similar fate-with a fourth woman, he had attempted to ruin, looking fearfully upoi him? And near him, in his last moments, the priest he had insulted and the friend whom he had de- ceived? Providence sometimes arranges the denouement of a man's life as dramatically as any play-wright.   {16        ERRING, YET NOBLE. Thus perished instantly, in a theatre, a successful and envied sybarite and libertine. Thus died, in a moment, the guilty heir to an enormous fortune, in the zenith of his pride and vice. Thus, in the midst of those he had wronged, and by the hand of her he had wronged, was sent to his God and Judge, without a warning, the unshriven soul of the liar, forger, seducer, and blasphemer, known as 'Iing Hericot!

Hericot, awaited her trial in prison. She was calm, cool, and self-possessed ; she betrayed no agitation; she seemed like one who was pursuing a definite, fixed course of action, and was determined to follow it unto the end, She was visited in her confinement by a few of her "friends," women of her own class, who offered her all that they had to give, poor creatures-their sympathy. For though not capable of a vengeance like that of Fannyv, they could understand and appreciate, from their own personal experiences, at least some of the motives which had led their companion to the perpetration of this fearful deed. Fanny was also visited by Julia and Howard ; but she said but little to them. "Call upon me," she exclaimed, " after my trial-after my fate is decided; then I will speak fully to you. But now 1 have nothing to say. Leave me. Do not think me insensible to your kindness; but leave me for the present." One or two lawyers, interested in her case, struck by her beauty, and knowing the general outlines of her story, as given in the newspapers, offered their professional services; but she declined them. "I will plead my case myself," she said ; and she adhered to this strange determination. What her thoughts might be in the long, dreary hours of her confinement, we will not pretend to describe. All that we know is that "she gave no sign." The day of her trial arrived, and the court-room was crowded. All murder cases have a large audience ; but on this occasion the   510        EBBRRING, TET NOBLE. crowd was unusually great, as it was known that the prisoner intended to plead for herself. At the appointed time the bustle of the court-room ceased, and all eyes were fastened upon the prisoner as she entered in the company of the officers, and took her place in the crimillal's dock. Never in her life had Fanny Walters looked so charmino She wore the same dress in which she had committed the murder --a dark crimson, which was in unison with her. magmnficently dark complexion. Her hair was so arranged as to display its richness of beauty, and her superb form, might well fill with envy all the women who beheld her. Her beauty produced a most favorable impression upon tie crowd, especially its male portion. She looked as unlike a murderess and a Cyprian as possible. Her face was a shade paler than its wont; but she was perfectly self-possessed-gazing, with her dark, restless eyes, upon those around her as though she was herself an eager spectator, not a spectacle. She surveyed the crowd, and recognized the faces of Julia and -of Howard, also of several of the women of her own class. She smiled upon these latter, and then concentrated her attention upon the trial, which now commenced, and was continued in the customary manner. When it was time for the accused to speak, all eyes were riv- eted with more earnestness than ever upon the prisoner. And Fanny Walters seemed to feel this fact ; for she at first hesitated, and then stammered. ^ "She will break down," whispered the crowd. But the crowd were mistaken. She soon, wonderfully soon, recovered from all the embarrassment natural, almost inevitable, to a woman under her circumstances, and spoke (in a clear, musical voice, whose lowest accent sounded loudly amid the death-like stillness of tile listening multitude) as follows  "Gentlemen of the jury, I speak to you as fathers, husbands, brothers, shns; as those who have mothers, daughters, wives, or sisters of your own ; as men who love and are loved by women.   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        519 I speak to you as a woman, and I crave your indulgence for what errors of language I may be, through my ignorance, betrayed into. I have nothing but truth to say, and I would say it briefly, boldly, as my heart prompts me." She paused a moment, and you could have heard a pin drop in the grate-like silence of the vast crowd. Again she resumed : "I am accused of having murdered a man. I acknowledge, it would be folly to deny it, that I stabbed a man so that he died. Yes; I killed -him; but I hold that- I did not murder him. Justice is not murder; he deserved his fate; the dead man was himself a murderer of women. H killed him not so much to avenge my own wrongs, as those of my sex, and to save others From his arts ; for if he had live lonlger, he would have damned more women, as he has already destroyed me and many others." Here the judge making a movement as if to interrupt her, she continued, more rapidly ; "Listen : I was once pure. I had a doting father, and a devoted lover, whose life-wish was to call me his wife. In an evil hour, the man whom I killed came into our. quiet country, and made me his victim. For pastime, he damned me, and drove me from home to shame. "He injured not only me, but mine. My father went mad with shame and died of a broken heart ; and my lover's life was blasted. Was not the author of this misery a murderer? I ask you all, as in the sight of that great Judge whom none can de- ceive, was not this man as much a murderer as if he had taken a knife at midnight and killed my father and myself? "But I and mine have not been the only ones he has-wronged beyond redemption. I know of a wife in this very city, the wife of a rich man, his friend, whom the dead man has ruined past hope, though the husband and the world know it not yet. I know of another victim in the country " Here the speaker was i4terrupted by a sudden commotion. A woman had fainted, an was carried out. ' The heat of the crwded room, most probably," said some one in the audience. But no; the fainting of this woman haA ' . / J     11           XI   529/0       ERRING, YET NOBLe. tnother and-far different cause. It was " the wife" just alluded to by the speaker. This wife, Katherine Somers' friend and Henry Hericot's victim, being present at the trial, felt a sudden rhock of conscience and shame at the unexpected words of Fanny Walters, and fell, unconscious. The tumult consequent on this incident having subsided, the criminal continued : "This man's career has been one series of murders; and yet while alive he was flattered and feasted. Why, then, should I be condemned for one murder when he has committed a score? Why should there be one rule for the man and another rule for the woman? If there is any difference between the two, the latter is the better. I am a sinful woman, but there are many of my class who are nobler, aye, and purer, than many of those women who would despise us." She looked proudly around as she spoke as though expecting to meet and confront the gaze of Kathe- rine Hericot; but Katherine. was not there. "Aye, and many of us would rise from the depths to which men have brought us, and would become pure women did women them- selves but permit us to do so. But no, therworld first sinks us in perdition, then keeps us down, and meanwhile curses us because we do not rise. All are not thus cruel." Her eye seemed to seek gratefully the answering gaze of Julia, who, with Howard, sat listening intently. "But most of you are fearfully unjust to us!" She paused, and the audience took breath. This was the boldest talk that had ever been heard in a court of justice. Learned lawyers looked at each other in astonishment; men smiled meaningly, and the women present moved uneasily; they were not accustomed to such language as this ; it was to them a new experience. The judge spoke to the prisoner : "If you have aught to say in your defense touching directly the matter in question, the murder of which you are accused, we will listen, otherwise you must be silent." Being thus charged, Fanny Walters "'summed' up her case."   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        521 "The man whom I killed was; a murderer; the murderer of me and mine; our murderer in the sight of the God of the world, even if not in the sight of the world itself i He was the cause of my death to happiness, honor, and all hope of heaven; he was the cause of my father's sudden death from shame, and of my lover's long living death of agony. He has been in like manner the murderer of many other women, and of those who loved them. I forgave him the wrongs :he had done. to me'; I met him and spared him when he was in my power, though I had sworn vengeance upon him. But I had, or thought I had, a mission to discharge to myn sex. I might forego my own vengeance, but I would, at least, preserve other women from my fate. So I warned him . that if he attempted to deceive and ruin women in the future as he had done in the past, the retribution I had not taken for myself I would take for them. Spite of my warning he sinned. Again was he solemnly warned, and again did he meanly rob a woman off er little all of honor. He tried to hide his crimes, to conal them in the country, but in vaili. I was on his track; I knew all. Still I would have spared him possibly. But one night I went to the theatre. Lying on my table in my room was a beautiful little dagger, which a Southern friend of mine had made me a present of. M1y escort noticed it, and, in jest, suggested that I should ' enact a tragedy part for this night only,' as he phrased it, and take the dagger with me. I complied carelessly with the request, and placed the dagger in my bosom. I was utterly uncoil- scious that the man whom I afterwards killed was to be at the theatre ; utterly guiltless 'at that moment .of any bloody intent. But as the audicnce were dispersing after the per- formance I saw this man, though he saw me not. I heard him make a remark which indicated his utter heartlessness, meanness, and lust, and which proved that, far from relin quishing his foul schemes, he had conceived a black design upon the beautiful creature who had performed the part of Camille that very evening. Utterly disgusted, indignant at   O 22       ERRING, YET NOBLE. this proof of his total depravity, convinced that all hope ol his reform were vain, convinced that further forbearance to him was only further wretchedness and dishonor to my sex, the memory of my own wrongs, the recollection of my father and my lover swelling within me, I, scarcely knowing'what I did, felt for my dagger, raised my arm, and the world knows the rest I "True, I killed the man, but I ask you is it mlurder to kill such men? Is it not JUSTICE? 'If there were honest laws; if society looked at such offences as his as God& looks at them; if an earthly tribunal afforded retribution for the murderers of women,' then would my act be without excuse. I should have waited for the action of the law ; but no, society smiles upon the slayers of women; and the only vengeance that can be had upon them is just stch vengeance as I have taken. Can you truly say, then, that I am guilty of murder? c' Can you pronounce me guilty when you know that I but avenged my own ruin, the death of my old father, and the blasted life of him who would have been my husband? Can you condemn me when you feel that more than my own wrongs, I avenged those of my sex?-that I killed him not merely as an act of retribution, but also of preservation- not only for those whom he had already destroyed, but those whom he would have destroyed had his evil life been pro- longed? He might some day have ruined one of your wives or daughters, gentlemen of the jury; who knows? he spared no one. Can you blame me that having warned him, finding all in vain, in a moment of sudden passion, being by chance armed with an instrument of 'death, I was goaded to inflict upon him the chastisement he so richly deserved? "What would any of yozu have done had this man brought upon your dear ones the woe and shame he has brought upon me? Would you not have killed him like .a dog? And are there twelve on earth, twelve honest men, with honest and manly breasts, the sons, husbands, fathers or brothers of "-omen, who dare condemn the deed of her who has simply / ' ,  -   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        523 tared to do what they themselves would have done in the like circumstances? Let old men with stony hearts, who Call themselves moralists, prate of the sin of vengeance; vet every true man must feel that there is one crime which the law has never reached, the crime of killing a maiden's honor and a woman's soul. And until the law, with its iron fingers, clutches with a death grasp this foul offence, justice -must be supplied by vengeance. "Men of the jury, if a woman's honor is worth less than a villain's life, if you desire some day to see your own homes violated by the seducer, and have no redress, you will con- demn me for murder. "I But if virtue is worth more than life (and none know this better than such poor wretches as I who have lost the former forever) ; if you would restrain the betrayer from entering your own doors; if you think, as the great God thinks, as He mlust thnk, that the man i lho sins is as guilty' as the woman who sins; that to kill a woman's honor is as great a crime as to kill that woman's body ; if you would not have lust to stain your own loved ones, then you will pronounce me innocent of all-of all-save taking a just retribution in the only way in which I could obtain it. I have done." She ceased. The audience (which had scarcely, as it were, taken breath of late, so entranced was it witlh the beautiful woman, who, with flashing eyes and varying, mobile face, and graceful because natural gestures, and true because natural eloquence, had uttered such strange and bold words) now moved restlessly to and fro, as if released from the spell of a long enchantment. And, said one man to another, loud enough to be heard by at least one-half of the crowd, , This woman has spoken truth if ever truth was spoken in a court of justice." This seemea to be the general sentiment of the audience. And now all eyes were turned expectantly, impatiently, anxiously upon the jury, who held in their power life and death. We know what law is, and What legal forms are. Bat human   524        ERRING, YET NOBLE. nature has something more in it, thank God, than merely Cold, legal technicalities. Even judges, prosecuting attorneys, and jurymen have hearts, and these were touched by Fanny Walters speech, looks, and story. We know not whether great legtal authorities would have ap- proved or not ; we merely know the jury brought in a verdict of "Not Guilty."  The crowd gave a cheer, which, though very unprofessional, was very sincere. The judge himself, and the prosecuting attorney himself, each in his own soul, approved the verdict. And Fanny Walters, exhausted by the emotions and exhibitions of the day, fell into the extended arms of her "friends," those poor women of her own unfortunate class who had come to the trial to give their sympathy to their fellow- sinner. Thus, by this decision, a jury determined and a judge allowed, that seduction was equivalent to murder, and punishable as such. "Oh, upright judge. A Daniel come to judgment," would there were more such judges and such juries I *       %       +       * It rained on the night which followed the day of the trial. It poured incessantly. And in a certain graveyard, not far from the city, it was mournful, exceedingly.  A graveyard, on a lonely, rainy night is the saddest thing on earth, saving the grave itself. There was one mound which was comparatively newly made ; it was that of him who was once Henry Hericot. Yes, the elegant form of that accomplished libertine lay wrapped in a winding-sheet, and confined in a coffin; doubtless the epicure worms were preparing to make a fine feast but of his delicate and pampered flesh.

A FINAL VISIT TO A VICTIM.' AFTER her acquittal on the charge of murder, and her subse. quent release, Fanny Walters returned with her old companions, to her old quarters, but she did not return to her old life. From the day she avenged herself and sex upon her betrayer, from that day she was a changed woman. Instead of being gay and reckless, she became thoughtful and quiet; and she abandoned all her former habits. It seemed as though she were now enter- ing upon some new phase of life. Spite of the notoriety she had acquired, she confined herself to her room and lived in a state of almost entire seclusion. Julia Sinfgerly (how strange it seems to write Singerly for Witherson I) thought often' and deeply upon Fanny Walters. The memory of her former visits to this woman; the similarity, yet great difference in their lives' histories (both deceived by and both avenged upon the same man, but in so contrasted a manner) ; the solemn truths, so fully appreciated by one, uttered upon her trial by the other; the words spoken by the latter while in prison, "Call upon me after my trial, after my fate is decided; then i will speak fully to you ;" all these things caused Julia to think upon this strange, unfortunate, desperate creature, with great earnestness; and at last she determined to visit her personally. It so chanced that Howard, too, was deeply inter- ested in this woman, and longed to make one effort more for her salvation. So  it happened that, one morning, Julia and Howard called together upon Fanny Walters. She still occupied her old room, the same in which Julia had first seen her. There had been no change in the apartment; the same elaborate carpet was upon the floor, the same prints hung upon the walls ;  articles of bijou and "nicknacks " were   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         527 still scattered around on the dressing-cases and mantle-piece, the same fanciful clock marked the passing hours, and the -closet, as revealed by the half open door, was still full of dresses. 'The bird, however, whose cage, at the former visit, was suspended from the window, was dead, and the cage hung there no Inore, it had beeln given away. Our visitors found the mist ess of the apartment attired in crimson ; in the same dress in which she had stabbed Hericot, and which she also wore on the day of the trial. Did she wear tiis dress because it harmonized with her complexion, or because there were fearful, fateful associations connected with it which strangely fascinated her? We leave the reader to decide this point. Fanny Walters; herself, throughout the interview, was more quiet, less excitable and passionate, more steadily solemn, if we may use the expression, than we ever before remember her. She looked, and moved, and spake like one whose fate was predeter- mined. "I am glad to see you," she said to her visitors, as she handed them chairs. "I expected that you would call upon me some time; and now I must first ask your pardon- for the abrupt man- ner in which I met your kindness to me when you last visited me. But I was a prisoner then ; now I am free, and will speak freely to you, if so you would have me. You are very kind to me; and to such as me but very few are kind. I have never forgot- ten you-and I thank you." -  "Oh, if you would but Het us save you," said Julia ; "save you from such a life as this!" "I understand you, madam," replied Fanny Walters; "but you are somewhat mistaken. I have already abandoned my former life. While I live, I err not." "Why, then, do we find you in this place?"  "What would you have? Where else can I go? Besides, I have some friends in this place, some true friends, who did not desert me in my day of trial. I shall live among these till I die."    528        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "Oh, no; do not say so," interrupted Julia. "I have money and influence. I will obtain for you some' respectable employ- ment in some distant place, where you are not known. You shall earn an honest and a pleasant living, and shall be happy yet.' "No, no," said the woman she addressed ; " such a life as you dream of is not for me. Besides, I have erred too deeply for heaven to permit such a wretch as I to be so happy as you pic- ture." "Doubt not the -mercy of God, my dear young lady," said the Rev. George Howard, solemnly. "My dear young lady 1"These words rung in Fanny Wal- ters' ears. "tHe calls one, one whom most would shrink from, a ' dear young lady,' as though I were his equal, or his sister's, or his mother's, or his wife's friend." So she thought, and the thought brought the tears of gratitude into her eyes. Did. Howard make a mistake in addressing'the creature after this fashion? We think not. "Doubt not that'heaven has good days in store for you yet, dear Fanny," said Julia. "Dear Fanny' I She calls me dear Fanny, as though I were her sister," thought the poor Magdalen. "God bless you both for your kindness to such as I," she cried, aloud. "But it is too late," she continued, " it is too late." "There are no such words in the vocabulary of heaven as 'too late,"' said Howard. "I know of an asylum from the world, to which you can retire; and there, hidden from the gaze of men, you can devote your life to penitence and to religion. No worldly cares shall disturb'you ; you shall be free to give up your whole time and soul to prayer and repentance." Howard was not generally in favor of exclusively-religious institutions of the kind he referred to ; very far from it. But there are exceptions to all rules ; and he considered that the pe- culiar nature, history, and position of Fanny rendered her more   ERRING) YET NOBLE.         529 than usually fit for the peculiar influences of such an institution as he described. But Fanny, thankfully yet firmly, negatived this proposal also. "But how do you intend to live?" asked Julia. "I have money enough to support me ; and I do not expect to live very long." "Do you often think of death?" asked Howard. -; "Often-of late, always," replied Fanny. "And do you believe in a life after death?"  "Oh, do not ask me - Your questions but add to my torture. i What matters it what I believe? My fate, I feel, is sealed ; my end determined." "And that fate, that end is ----?" "What you may ere long see ; at least as far as human eye can see it." Howard now, in his character of religious teacher and priest of the Gospel, spoke to his listener briefly, but powerfully and thoroughly, of the great doctrines of the Christian faith. He treated of sin, repentance, atonement, forgiveness, and restored virtue ; he spoke of rewards and punishments after death; in short, he preached a true, sensible, manly, healthy, sufficient re- ligion. Fanny Walters listened and occasionally interrupted him. She evidently admired his- creed ; and believed, in a general way, in all the doctrines. But its promises she considered inapplicable to herself; its duties were foreign to her lot; its threats were all that were for her; and these she had made up her mind to endure. She thought not of what might have been ; she thought not of what could be ; she merely saw what had been, what is, and what, as her fate would have it, would be. She was calmly desperate, and desperately determined. And Howard found with grief that his religious efforts were in vain. -There was a dark, fatal something in the soul of Faniny Walters that his lights could not reach : he must leave it to its darkness. 23   S30        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "You will not let me save you 1" he cried, in despair. "It cannot be as you would have it," she replied ; " but I am as grateful to you both as though what you so kindly wish were possible. Oh, if all good men and women were but as forgiving and condescending to us poor women as you have been to me, there would be fewer of us. You especially, madam, have been most kind. I have never forgotten your first visit to me in this very room, years ago. See, I have the handkerchief I took from your friend," (alluding to Mary Barton, who, as our readers will remember, had accompanied Julia on her first visit to Fanny), "see I here it is," producing the handkerchief from one of the drawers of a bureau. "And how is your friend?"Fanny con. tinued. "How is she? well, I trust." "She is not only well," replied Julia, " but happy. She is married to a man who is worthy of her, and who loves her dearly." "I am very, very glad to hear it," said Fanny, heartily. "May she live long to enjoy her happiness ; for she has a good, kind soul. Give her this trifle for me," (handing Julia a little "nicknack" from the dressing-case), "and tell her to think of me when I am gone." "When you are gone l" "Yes: when I am dead. "Why do you thus talk of dying? You are very young, and have many years of life before you." "Ah, no : women like me never live to be old. It is a mercy that we do not, both for others and for ourselves. I may never see my next birth-day ; I feel I shall not." Here Howard took a part in the conversation. He seemed to be struck with a sudden idea, gathered from the words of Fanny Walters. Turning to her, he said: "Do you think that men or women have a right to take their own lives?" Somewhat surprised at the suddenness of-this question, the woman thus interrogated answered by another question :   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        -31 -( What do you mean?" "What I say," answered Howard. "Do you think that it can ever, under any possible, conceivable circumstances, be any- thing -but a great crime to take one's own life?" The woman evaded a direct reply on this point. "What do you think?" she said. Howard's utterance on this subject had, at least, nothing uncertain about it. "I think that in all cases suicide is murder-a murder which nothing can justify."  He said these words solemnly, and his hearer seemed impressed by them. At the word "murder" she started'visibly; it sug- gested thoughts of him who was at that moment lying in his grave, sent there by her hand. But she recovered, and, turn- ing to Julia, said- "See, I have not forgotten you or your first visit either." Going to the bureau she opened one of its drawers, and there in one of the corners was the little pocket Bible which, years ago, Fanny had taken as a memento from Julia. "Look," continued she, as she lifted the Bible from its place, "look where I have kept it; right here along with a lock of my father's hair, and a ring of my mother's ; along with the two dearest things I have on earth." Julia looked at the lock of grayish hair, the plain, well- worn gold ring, her own little Bible, and then at the tawdry finery, and sin-tokens which filled the remainder of the drawer. Then she gazed at the poor, lost, lovely woman herself who was the owner of this. miscellaneous assortment, and her eyes filled with tears as she determined to make one final effort more to save sweet, sinful Fanny Walters. "Oh 1 by that hair and that ring, so sacred in your me- mory; by the memory of your father, of your mother, listen to us-listen to the precepts of that little Book I gave you years ago. Do not be desperate, do not talk of dying, but live, be penitent, and be pure. You can rise-you must rise; you can do what other women have done, and be a true and happy woman yet. I knew, as well as I know myself, a   .           -           - .,   532       ERRING, YET NOBLE. woman who was once betrayed as you have been, aye, and betrayed by the same man. She, like you, was once guilty, and once desperate. She, like you, once thought that life must be all darkness and shame, and that there was no hope; but she lived on, repented, forsook her sin, atoned for it, and won the love of a true man, who (knowing all, for she would conceal nothing) made her his wife, and his honored and most happy wife she is at this very moment." Julia spoke earnestly, as well she might, for was she not narrating her own history'? And her words produced an effect upon her listener. A flash of enthusiasm illuminated her face, but only for a moment. The glow faded almost as rapidly as it had risen, and Fanny said-- "No, no, it is all in vain. What other women have done, or can do, I know not; but something within me tells me that my fate is sealed, to follow him." The last three words were uttered in an undertone. Then looking at the clock and noting the time, she said-- "But I expect some callers soon, persons who are not of your sort. I must bid you farewell. Take this (giving to Julia a photographic likeness of herself), and keep it in re- membrance; and if you should hear of my death-you may hear of it soon, you know-do not speak or think harshy of me ; and come and visit my grave in the summer time ; and do not grudge to strew a few flowers over the poor Cyprian. And, now, good bye-farewell-for ever "l "Why say ' forever?' asked Julia. "I have a presentment that we may not meeitaain-'at least on earth. Farewell, then. You will not refuse to shake hands with me, wretch as I am?"' "Shake hands with you! No," said Julia, "I must kiss you. I shall think of you as a sister; and as a sister I kiss you."

So saying, the clergyman kissed the Oyprian on the forehead. And gazing earnestly but silently on each other; the happy wife and the holy priest parted from the poor Magdalene-was it for the last time? "Do you know that I think this strange creature, this FEanny Walters, may die soon?" said Howard to Julia on their "It is only her sad fancies ; she looks strong enough. What do you think she may die of?" Howard told her his opinion on this point. Julia started. I "Can we not prevent her?" she asked. ".-No; impossible. How can any one prevent such a thing as that, at least under present circumstances I I said to her all I could well say on the subject just now, you remember." "Ah, true. So you did.

May God have mercy on her soul," said Howard. ," Amen," said Julia.   ^534iBR RTGS,       YET NOBLE. CHAPTER VII. A iMAN, A FOOL, AND A CHLD. IN the far-off country, where she, who was now Fanny Walters, had lived during her happy childhood and her pure girlhood; near the lake whereon she had sported, in the days of auld ]ang syne, still lived the man who had once been her lover. He was, and had been, since the disgrace and flight of the woman. he had adored, with a love that such as he can feel but once on earth, a lonely, solitary, sad man. He had never smiled since the woman of his heart had left him, her home, and her honor together. Still he was not gloomy or morose. He felt that life had its duties, even if it had no longer its joys, and that there was such a thing as a preparation for heaven, even if there were few plea- sures on earth. And in the depths of his secret heart, he yet cherished a wild though hopeless and joyless love for the woman who had darkened and destroyed his life. True, she was lost, she was impure, she could never be aught to him or to any honest man ; but he had loved her once and he loved her still, though-he never, by any chance, even so much as mentioned her name. One day lie casually came across a New York paper, contain- ing a  full and elaborate account of the singular trial and defence of an evil woman of that city, known as Fanny Walters. Some- thing in the account suggested to him, he scarcely knew how, the startling idea that, perchance, this was the woman whom he  had loved and lost. That, perchance, Fanny Walters was no other than she, of whom, for years, he had heard nothing   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        535 His reason scouted the idea, yet- the thougrht returned and haunted him. He sent to a friend in New York for other papers containing the trial of Fanny Walters, and compared them. He noted all descriptions of the culprit's appearance and manners, all the items of her history which had transpired, and all other information regarding her. The more he read, the more this idea of the identity of the woman-with the love .of his youth grew upon him. He could not rid himself of it, by day or by night; he waxed feverish and agitated; and at last, one day, he made a strange, a wild resolve. He would go to :New York, he would end all doubt by per- I    sonal experiment. And if his idea was correct, if the fallen one and his lost idol were identical, wly, then, lie would look upon her face once more before he died. He would not suffer himself to be recognized by her ; he would hold no interview with ler; be had not strength to bear it. He would merely look upon her face; her face, though sin-faded, yet still, doubtless, lovely. Then he would-return home and die. He yielded to the power of this idea ; took the train to New York, and reached our great metropolis. 'We need not fully narrate the story of his investigations in this city. Suffice it to say, hle at last discovered that his idea was correct; Fanny Walters and the woman he had loved, aye whom he still loved, were identical. -He also traced Fanny to her residence, to the house in which she lived, to the horrible home of sin which she had made for herself. He found the house ; but he passed not, he t hought not of passing, its threshold ; he shuddered at the thought of breath- ing its atmosphere of pollution. So he patiently walked past it day by day, and loitered near it, in the hope that she might some time issue forth, and he might see her. It could only be for a moment, it could only be once, but still it would be seeing her once again. One afternoon he passed the house for the last time, as he determined, in his own mind. He saw her not. Well, he would walk down Broadway, to his hotel, and then depart to his coun- s   try home, to leave it no more. It was fated, so he thought, that he should never see her again. But he starts I What does he behold? Ah, reader, people behold much more on Broadway than one imagines. He sees a finely'dressed, and evidently handsome woman, approaching hint from the opposite direction. She seems to be desirous of avoid- ing public attention; and yet the eyes of most are eagerly fixed upon her. She sees him not; but he sees her. His soul is on fire; his pulses beat as they have not beat before, as he thought till now they could never beat again. 'Tis the woman he has  sought; 'tis she whose home he had just now passed in vain; 'tis she whom he once thought to marry; 'tis she whose kisses had once been his; who had been once pledged to be his wife; tis she, the murderess, the Camille, the ill-fated, the still lovely, the still loved woman, who had lost her pure childhood's name,. and was now known but as Fanny Walters.    Her face again! How   the old time comes over his spirit. He scarce can breathe. Involuntarily he calls her by the sweet name he had known  her by when he walked with her in the country in the long summer's evenings; the name-she answered to when his arm was round her waist, as they floated in their boat on tie  lake.  He calls her by her old name, and in his old familiar voice. She starts with intense surprise, as though the heavens had opened, and the world was giving up its dead. Her past had given up its dead. She turns, she sees him; in a moment, quick %s the lightning's flash, spite of all the lapse of years, and chane  )f scene, she recognizes him. All the memories of many bitter rears are crowded into a second's space; all the recollections of ter country home, her dead father, her youthful sports and urity, and him-her lover; all the sorrows and all the sins of  * he long, last years ; all these, and God only knows what beside, ush upon her at once; the shock is too great even for her. She tters something which only He who knoweth all things can in- rpret, and falls, fainting. Her old lover rushes to her and atches her in his arms. '-'         One passionate embrace, despite the wondering looks of the gathering crowd; one long, bitter, heart-expressing, heart-break- ing kiss ; one groan, one prayer, and, let us hope, one blessing; one more kiss upon the painted, faded, saddened cheek of the lost woman, who was to have been his wife ; one exclamation of fearfully-mingled emotion. And, handing her to the care of some ladies, who charitably volunteer their assistance, he departs. It is all over. Life has nothing more. He has seen her. He goes to his country home. Within twelve months he was dead. Men sometimes die of love even in America, and in the nine- teenth century. "No, George, the idea is ridiculous. What I marry me; a woman lik6 me I What do you suppose I wish to be married for? Am I not wretched enough already? Besides, do you suppose I could ever be constant? Go home, and become sober and sensible." "Ah, Fanny, you do not talk as your heart, your soul, your better nature prompts. You but make a mockery of your- self. You cannot, in your heart, laugh at the true love of a man." "George, are you serious? Men often talk of marrying such as 1, but never do it. Are you in earnest? Do you love me well enough to marry me lawfully in the sig]/t of heaven and earth?"' "Come with me to the nearest priest; then ask me that question. Fanny, I love you. I know what you have been, wheat you are. I know that all your own sex despise you, or pretend to do so; that all mine make sport of such as you; but I also know that you are beautiful, and that deep in your soul is a noble nature, which you never can reveal in such a life as now you lead. You are not what you seem, * but better, far better." "But your family, George--the sister of which you have 23*   5    ,    E aRRING, YET NOBLE; told me.' Do you not think of them? They would never acknowledge me as your wife." "What if they did not? The world may sneer at you and laugh at rne. What matters it? Love is its own world ; it has its own laws, and laughs at all others. If my mother and sister will not receive you, so be it; I regret it, but it will not shake my love. I am independent of the world. I am rich, as you know; young, no fool (though fools may call me so); good looking, as men go ; ambitious, bold, and I love you. Let us leave this country; let us go to France, Italy, anywhere where you are not known, where your past can be buried in oblivion. Then and there as my wife you can forget all but your love for me; and all -except that I love you and have saved you." He pleaded earnestly. His heart was in his words ; his voice was full of music-the voice of a lover always is; and as she listened, the soul of Fanny Walters was sorely tried. Why should she not take advantage of George Atlerton's fancy for her? Why should she not take him at his word and marry him? Other girls of her class had done this thing. Such marriages were by no means of unfiequent oc. currence. Why should a sense of honor, which none would ever understand or appreciate, prevent her from achieving a glorious success in life? Why should she adhere to the dark plan which her mind had recently conceived? Besides, here was a chance for her to redeem her guilty past by a pure, loving future. For a moment she was in doubt, and the earthly fate of George Atherton hung in the balance. But Fanny Walters, though a fallen woman, was not base. She would not avail herself of a man's folly. Besides, she had vowed a vow ; she had registered an oath'; her fate was sealed. What to her, then, was marriage or hope?      ^ "No, George," she said, fixing full her beautiful eye upon her companion, " it cannot be; you love me now, but were I' to marry you you would, in a year, curse me, and with cause.   What you talk about is utterly impossible. It can never be. It never ought to be. You are a man and have a man's work to do; and you have every chance to help you in your work. You have a bright prospect before -you which should not be darkened by such a one as I. You say you love me. Such a love as this must prove fatal. And, despite all your oaths, such love cannot last. Time and the world would soon kill it, and the more violent it was, the sooner would it be over. There can be but one love between a man like you and a woman like me, and this is not the love that leads to marriage. Nay, protest not, George, but hear me. You have seen the play of Camille; you have seen in it how a man of your stamp loved a girl of mine. She accepted him, and you know what misery came of it. She died of a broken heart; and broke her lover's. Beware, George I Leave me, Forget that you ever knew me--you men can easily forget- seek out some purer idol, wed her, live honored and happy, and never think of me." Here George Atherton interrupted her with exclamations and protestations. The young man was infatuated, but the woman was firm. And at last she led him to the door, and said, "Now, George, you must go at once, I wish to be alone, Good bye, and God bless you. It will be a great comfort in the last hours of a poor girl to remember that you thought enough of her to offer her honorable marriage ; a still greater comfort, to remember that she had honor enough to refuse it." The door of her room closed upon the slowly, reluct- antly departing form of George Atherton, and Fanny Wal- ters threw herself upon the bed and wept bitterly. Our readers can readily understand this interview. George Atherton was a young man of family and position, who had become infatuated with the charms of Fanny Walters. He would have ruined himself by a m6salliance had not the poor woman herself restrained him. It not unfrequently happens that young men forget them- selves, their interest, and heir obligations, and degrade   540   -     RRMGaG, YET NOBLE.            1 themselves by marriage with accomplished sinners, who sel- dom imitate the example of Fanny Walters, but secure their prey with avidity. And this is one of the great dangers in- cident to vice . Of course, a man of social position and refinement is in little danger of marrying a low, vulgar, degraded woman. But all sinners" are not " low, vulgar, or degraded ;" and these exceptions to- the rule of their class are the more dangerous. Many a lost woman is beautiful, accomplished, even refilled in her tastes, often gifted with many noble qualities; and this brightness contrasting, as it does, so strongly with the darkness of her own life, and with the foulness of the companions of her own class, renders her al] the more terrible. And under the influence of this strange, wild, unholy fascination, many men make shipwreck of their lives. The streets are crowded, for the day is very file. It is a difficult, even a dangerous thing to attempt to cross the thoroughfares, thronged with the swift stages, express wagons and private " turnouts." A little girl endeavors to passsfrom one side of the street to the other; but she becomes entangled in the rush of vehicles, and grows frightened. A stage approaches rapidly, the driver of which being engaged in collecting his fare, does not perceive her. A moment more and she will be run over, probably killed. She cannot escape; she is too frightened to make an effort to do so. She is a very pretty child, rather plump, yet graceful,' with blue eyes, flaxen hair in curls, and a sweet face. Doubt- less she has many that love her, many to whom she is very, very dear, to whom she is more than all the world beside, who, perhaps, at .this moment are anxiously wondering where she is. And yet she. probably will be in a moment but a mangled mass merely to be wept over and then buried.

But no, a woman darts from the sidewalk; and at great risk to her own life and limb, arrests the career of tho stages; and, snatching the child in her arms, bears it away in safety. The little girl recovers from her alarm, and smiles in the face of her preserver. And Fanny Walters, for it is she, is. more than repaid for her risk. "Where do you live, my little one?" she asks of the child. ' In F  - street," is the reply. "And how comes it," asks Fanny, "that you started out alone?" "O11, I was playing with another girl, Mary Wilson, who lives near our house, and she coaxed me to go down the street, though I knew father would not like it. And then she ran off and left me. And then I wanted to cross over the street and go back to father, and then I got so frightened. Dear, kind, good lady, how father will love you fur taking such care of me." "Your father, then, loves you so dearly, does he, little one?" "Oh, yes; oh, yes; and then I am all he has now, he says, since poor mamma died and went to heaven." So spake the child in her youthful confidingness and sim- plicity. And as the woman listened, a thrill of memory rushed through her heart. She, too, had once a father, and one who loved her as lis almost earthly all since her mother "died and went to heaven." But she had cursed and killed that father.         ' "1 cannot leave you, little one," said Fanny to her child companion, " till I see you safe Give me your hand, and tell me exactly where you live, and we will go there now together." So saying, she took hold of the child's hand, and the two   -42        R ERBING, rET NOBLE. left the noisy, bustling Broadway, walked down one of the more retired streets, and were most excellent friends at once, With all her sins, Fanny Walters had always kept through- out her life a pure corner in her heart for children. The young always took a liking to her; and she or lie of whom this can be said is not wholly depraved. The two soon reached F   street, and stopped at the door of the child's home. It was an humble but respectable dwelling. The ring at the bell was answered bv the " fa- ther" himself, an old man, whose face lit up joy at the sight of his child, for whomn he had, the last half hour, suffered a world of anxiety, and in search of whom he had dispatched his only servant. When the little girl recited her story and told of the " kindness of the dear, good lady," the voice of the old man faltered as be spake his heartfelt thanks. "Oh I my dear young lady, may God in heaven bless you," he cried; "you do not know how  I love that child. Her mother is in heaven, and that careless, reckless, darling little creature is all to me on earth. May the blessing of an old man whom you have blessed be with you ever." She bowed her head and took the old man's benediction.' It gave her more genuine delight than could have been con- ferred by the gift of a palace. God only knows how much she had need of a blessing.

She slept ill at nights now, tossed to and fro in thoughit, and did not fall asleep till long after midnight; consequently, it was gen- erally late when she rose. But on the morning in question, she left her bed before six o'clock, attired herself plainly, and partook of an early and, therefore, solitary breakfast. After breakfast, she arranged her room and attended to various personal matters. She then did four things, to whicht we wish to call the readerls attention in the order in which they occurred. She first went to one of the drawers of her bureau and took thence a likeness of herself (which, by-the-by, was extraordinarily life-like), and kissing it, looking at it iiitently for many minutes, placed it in the bosom of her dress. She then took a pair of scissors and cut off therewith a lock of her own hair, and wrapping the severed tress in a neat paper, placed it also in the bosom of her dress. She then opened a trunk which stood in her closet, and took thence a packager of considerable size. This package she laid on a table and unwrapped it. It contained bank-notes to a consid. erable amount. She counted these, and re-counted them; the tally was correct. And then she fell into a fit of musing, which at last found expression in-broken words : "Shall I give these to her? They are," and she shuddered, "the price of sin. Shall I dare pollute her pure hand with their touch? No, no. But then she needs money to live-or she will be forced to beg--or to sin.. This money, which I have gained by error, may preserve her from it; it cursed me, but it may bless her. She shall have it, then. She shall have it all," and O8            *          .   slbe accordingly rewrapped the money in the package, and placed it in the pocket of her dress. And then she went through the feminine occupation of " put- ting on her tlings," and passed out into the street, and, stopping at a book store, purchased several volumes. They were not sud books as one would have ima ined to be bought  y a won Walters walked rapidly to the depot of     Railroad, procured her ticket, and started in the first train. In short, she was going to visit her sister, who was still at the countly school wher  e welast saw her. In due course of time, she reached the school and embraced her sister,who was enthusiastically delighted to behold her once But Fanny's feelings on this occasion had a depth of which the soul of her little   companion could form no idea. In the eyes of the former, this was no mere visit that could at will be repeated. ro; it was something nuch more than this, and much more sol- wnd she clasped her little sister to ler heart with so much passionate veheuence that the child wondered, and asked -- "Whhy   , sister y do you clasp me so tightly?" "Because I am so glad, so very glad to seeyou, darling," was he reply. "Then why," asked the child, "do you not comde to see me ftener? And why do you not take me to your home during Children often ask questions which sorely puzzle older hearts  answer. Fanny hesitated a  moment, and then saie:d. There is somethigprevents mometh" imetanthing which you do ,t understand-which you never s/al understand. Buttell me, AW are you progressing with your studies?"  "Oh, very well, dear sister. All my teachers are so kind to W, and they psaise me so much."        i  -o Becaue I  a  ssoglad  o ver  gla ee yo, daring, ;h  rpl.             t         wa   "That's right. Be a good girl, and prosper in your studies,  and you will always find friends-even," and here her voice be- came inaudible to her companion, " even when you have no longer a sister."  Fanny then inquired concerning the friendships her sister had formed among her school companions, and asked particularly concerning her health and comfort, receiving on all these points satisfactory replies. And now came the most important and the most sorrowful portion of the interview between the sisters ; the part which the elder dreaded, and which, as yet, the younger was in happy ignorance of. "Sister, dearest," asked Fanny, as she kissed her companion, and wound her arm tenderly around her waist, " what would you do if I were obliged to leave you?"- "Leave me, how do you mean, sister?"' "Leave you for a long while-for many years; perhaps for- ever." "And never come to see me any more?" "Never any more." "Oh, I should die, dear sister ; for I do love you so, and I have no one else to'love. But you are but trying me. You do not mean anything. Why should you go away? Where are you going to?" Why, and where. These are expressive words. As applied to Fanny Walters, they were full of infinite and fearful meaning. But she replied: "Darling, you do not know what you say. Though it breaks ly heart, yet I must leave you-for a long, long while, at least." And then she muttered, as to herself,-- Yes ; if I remain, she would some day discover what a wretch I am-and that day sh1ll never come." -Here her sister broke forth into a fit of weeping. The grief of childhood is bitter and passionate; and the child-sister for a while would not be comforted; but Fanny assured her that they should meet again.   546        ERRINO, YET NOBLE. "But I did not tell her where." Thus Fanny Walters mentally qualified this last promise. When her sister's grief had somewhat calmed, Fanny sent for the principal of the school. After informing the old lady that circumstances, which she could not explain, forced her to leave the country, she requested her, begged of her as the greatest of favors, to act the part of a mother to her sister during her absence. The principal was, of course, surprised both at this intelligence and the accompanying request. But Fanny entreated her so earnestly, offered to compensate her so liberally, so wrought upon her feelings that at last she acceded to her wishes; especially as she had already learned to love her new charge, and was aware that she would cause her little care. So the matter was arranged; and the child, though she lost a sister, gained a mother. Fanny Walters then produced from her pocket the pack- age of bank notes to which we have already alluded, an d gave them to the charge of the principal to defray the ex- penses of her sister's board, clothing, and education. As for security for the right use of this money she required none. She was a tolerable judge of character, and one look at the kind, grave, honest, motherly face of the principal was suffi- cient. It was better than legal documents. And now the sisters were again left alone together. And Fanny took from the bosom of her dress the likeness of her- self, which she had placed there this morning, and gave it to her little sister, who received it with mingled tears and kisses. - "Every time I look at this,' said the affectionate child, "I will think of you, and pray for your safe return. But where can you be going to, dear sister? To what country?" "To a country that is better than this," was the reply. "Will you be happy there?" again asked her little'sister. "Happier than here, certainly," replied Fanny Walters with fervor. Poor soul, she certainly could not be more un- nappy there, wherever it was. -     *    ERRING, YET NOBLE.        54T She then toolk from the bosom of her dress the lock of her hair which she had cut off from her own head, a few hours ago, and handing it to her sister, said: "Here is a little keepsake; it will serve to remind you still more of me. But you must, return the compliment. I must have a lock of your hair, too." "So you shall, dear sister; and a nice long lock, too. See, I always carry my little scissors with me. Here you are. Look at this poor solitary curl often, andthink of your ever- loving little sister." "But here," said Fanny, as she opened the bundle con- taining the Bible, and the "moral and religious essays," "here is the very best keepsake I could possibly leave with you. Here are -two good works which I wish you to read, and not only to read, but to remember." "; Oh, I shall do so, sister," was the reply; " be sure I shall do both, because I ought to, and for your sake. I shall read your Bible just before I go to sleep, and I shall always carry your hair with me by day, and every night I slall put it under my pillow. Then you know, of course, I shall dream of you." Fanny sighed. Perhaps her sister might prove hereafter to be but a vain dreamer I "Oh! what a nice little Bible," said the child, as she turned over the pages of her present. "I shall take it to church with me every Sunday. Do you go to church often, sister?" Here was another home question, simple, natural, yet how could Fanny answer it? She could not tell a lie and say "yes." Yet, on the other hand, how could she shock the child's religious sentiments by telling her the awful truth that for years she had not entered a house devoted to the worship of the Almighty God. She evaded the question with a "not so mrfch as I should," and then-said, solemnly, tenderly, like one who is speaking the last words to one she loves-"Now. darling, listen to me, for I must leave you in   "8       ERRING, YET NOBLE. a moment: Be a good girl, study, please your teachers, love and obey the dear principal, read your Bible and the other book I have given you, and grow up to be a good woman. Pray to God every night and morning for yourself and for me, also, your poor sister. Perhaps it may not be even then too late." "Oh I I always pray for you, and many, many times a day," interrupted the child, throwing her arms affectionately around Fanny, and kissing her repeatedly. "And, darling," continued the latter, "I do not know whether you will understand me now, but you will some day;- so I want you to remember particularly what I now tell you. When you become a woman, and I think you will be a pretty woman, do not go out with young men much, and never without some older woman with you. Do not let the young men flattelr you, and do not heed their foolish compliments and vain speeches. But if some good young man, who loves to be with his pure mother and sisters more than with gay companions, seeks your love and asks you to be his wife, then, darling, say 'yes' to him, be happy with him, and be sure that you have my consent; and that, wherever I am, I will smile upon you and your marriage." Strange words these to fall from the lips of a sinner. Alas I experience in vice is a great teacher of the beauties of virtue I Sinners often times appreciate good more truly than do saints ; they have had a practical experience of the horrors of evil. Fanny Walters would have desired to be more explicit in her advice to her sister; but the pure young soul of the child would not have comprehended the meaning of the degraded, though loving, woman. And so, with more general counsel of this same kind, the sinner took farewell of her sister. We need not paint the pangs of their farewell. They kissed each other time and again ; they wept in each other's arms; they murmured fend words; they looked into each other's faces; they were now silent and now vehement with emotion   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        54:9 We leave it to- our readers' hearts to fully picture the scene of the separation. Once Fanny's determination almost failed her. The child was so loving and looked so beautiful, how could they part? But love and beauty cannot save from anguish and from parting. One last, long kiss, one long, last, fervid embrace, and the sinner had departed from her sister-forever I    550        ERRING, Y&T NOBLE. CHAPTER IX. THE LAST OF A WOMAN. ONi her return to the city her sister's simple words, "Do yozu go to church often?" haqnted the memory of Fanny Walters. Night came ; there was a church not far from the house wherein she lived ; as she sat by her window she heard its bell ring out upon the air; "I'll go to church to-night," she murmured to herself; and she went. It was a Methodist church ; and there was a prayer-meeting, or something of the sort, held within it. We do not approve of these "' institutions ;" they are noisy and sensational, and " of such is not the kingdom of heaven ;" still, there are exceptions to all rules, and the meeting held on this night was as sincere as it was fervid. And amongst the worshipers glided the form of a gay woman. She disturbed no one, none disturbed her. An awe came over her spirit. The walls were bare- of ornament, there were nd imposing ceremonies, yet she felt she was now, spiritually, in the presence of a God, before whom, ere long, she might appear face to face. She was no unbeliever; Women of her class seldom are; per- haps they would be happier if they could persuade themselves that there is no God; but, unhappily, like the devils, "Itheyr believe and tremble." Among tire pious Methodists at the prayer-meeting knelt Fanny Walters. And yet she scarcely heard or heeded a word that was spoken. She was busily engaged in offering up a strange, wild, yet sincere, and perhaps not unacceptable petition of her own-a petition such as suited her peculiar situation and purposes, and suited naught else,; a petition which orthodox people would call useless'and blasphemous, but which God, per-   ERRING, YET NOBLE.    .51 chance, deemed otherwise. It is a strange world this, and orthodox people are not infallible. She had entered a pew where the. lady, who previously occu- pied it, had moved and made room for her. I wonder if the lady wci have taken this trouble if she had known who her companion was? The service was over, and from the church our Magdelene re- turned to her home. And she sat by the window a long while- thinking. God only knows of what-perhaps of her little sister; per- haps, why not, of God? The morning of the next day, Fanny again arose at a com- paratively early hour ; but not to visit e relative, but an almost stranger, a stranger who was no longer an innocent girl, but an abandoned woman. Aye, doubly abandoned, forsaken both by virtue and by friends. The history of this woman was briefly as follows :--she was a pretty creature, who had been betrayed. and had then taken to vice for a livelihood. But sickness had claimed her for its own, and her " landlady " had attempted to send her from her evil home, her only " home," into the streets to starve, or the hospital to die. TBut Fanny had accidentally heard of her case, interested herself in it, and by paying the poor womanu's board during her sickness, had prevailed upon the landlady to allow her to remain. And to-day Fanny visited this womau, received her heartfelt thanks, spoke to her pleasant- ly, brought her some flowers and books, and served, in fact, as her guardian angel. "Oh, how generous, how considerate, how kind, how very, very kind you have been to poor me!" murmured the sick crea- ture on the bed to Fanny, as the latter bended o'er her couch of suffering. "How can I ever repay you?" "By holding your tongue," was the reply, "and by getting well as soon as possible." "But why should I get well?" continued the sick woman ;   352        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "what shall I gain by my recovery? I shall only have to re- sume my old, bad life." "Are you disgusted with your-your-your business?" asked Fanny. "Am I -disgusted with it? Miss Walters, I would rather die in this bed than live once more as I have lived-if I could help it!" "You can het it." "How-are you jesting?"  "No.  "Then, for God's sake, tell me i" And Fanny Walters told the sick woman how she had an acquaintance, a good lady, who was anxious to aid all those of her sex, however degraded, who desired to reform. In short, she spoke of Julia Witherson. And it was soon, arranged that Fanny (who had received from Julia an address at which a' letter would reach her) should write to Miss Witherson in regard to the sick woman's case. After some further conversa- tion, Fanny Walters kissed the woman solemnly upon the fore- head, bade her " good bye " and "God- bless her," and departed from her sightforever. Reader, there are many cases of kindness, charity, and friend- ship among " erring women," which put to the blush the lack of these qualities among women who are not, by the world, regarded as " erring." The charity and sympathy shown in this instance by Fanny Walters, to an unfortunate of her class, finds many parallels among our modern Magdelenes. And, surely, if He on high has written, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy," it must certainly come to pass that in the last day of account there shall be much forgiveness found for those who, despite their errors, have yet been truly merciful, and therefore noble. The next morning, Fanny Walters created a commotion in the house in which she lived. She announced her intention of "going away."   EBRRING, YET NOBLE.        553 The first one to whom she communicated this intelligence was a young girl amed "Lizzie," who had been for some time very ill, and over whom she watched with tender charity. Lizzie was still in bed when Fanny entered her room and in- formed her of her intention of departing. After the natural inquiries and expressions of surprise, Lizzie said- : "Oh, Fanny, do not leave us-at least, not yet." "Why not?" asked Fanny. "Because I wish to have a chance to show you my gralitude." "Gratitude for what?" "Oh, how can you ask such a question? You Know that for weeks you have been my nurse, my doctor; that you ]lave, I verily believe, saved my life-and at the risk of your own. You have watched over me, and exposed yourself, to save me. How can I ever forget your great kindness?" "Do you think it such a kindness to have prolonged your life?" "Why, how strange you talk this morning, Fanny I Of course, I do. Life is the best thing for all of us." "Is it?" said Fanny. "I think I know of a better thing." "And what," asked the wondering Lizzie, "can be better than life?" "Death," replied her companion, solemnly. The conversation was now interrupted by the entrance of two other inmates of the house. "Girls," said Lizzie, to the new-comers, "Fanny says she is going away."        - "Going away Il' echoed the two girls, in astonishment. "Yes," said Lizzie: " she won't tell me why nor where , but she is going soon." ",Why, Fanny," said one, "you never have told us anything of this before. You must have made up your mind very sud- denly.  Has anything happened?  We are very, very sorry to have you go. We all like you so much," "All, save Kate," corrected Fanny. 24   554        ERRING, YET NOBLE. "All, save Kate," continued the girl; " but then Kate is of no account. You are infinitely nicer than she is." "Come, girls, you flatter me," said Fanny. "No, no," replied the young girl; " you are so kind, so gen- tle to us all; you have been. with us so long, and you have done us so many-fFors, and have never quarrelled with us. You have been a little strange of late; but we do all love you so much."  It must be confessed that these words of praise, though ut- tered by a degraded one, were sweet. It was comforting to think that at least those of her own class liked her, and would miss her when she was gone. But she only said: "Come, girls, I want you to go with me to my room. I have some little keepsakes I wish to give you before I go." And, impressing upon the sick Lizzie a long, affectionate kiss, she left the apartment and went to her own room. By this time, the news of her almost immediate departure was noised throughout the establishment, causing much surprise; and, at last, all the inmates of the household were assembled -in her room, that apartment to which we have already several times conducted the reader. To one of the girls (Sallie, as she was called, a mercenary creature,) Fanny gave several pieces of her jewelry ; to another girl, called Emily, a gay, showy woman, she presented several of her most costly and brilliant dresses ; while to a third, who was of a more thoughtful nature than her companions, Fanny pre- sented her books, of which she had quite a collection. To Lizzie she sent a beautiful album, which she had bought expressly for her, and in which she had placed an excellent photographic like. ness of the donor. And to Kate, her rival, the woman who en- vied her beauty and success, she likewise made a valuable pres- ent. She was far above all petty feelings. She also made pres- ents to the remaining members of the household, not forgetting the colored servants. "Why, Fanny, cried one of her companions, "you certainly must be going to some place where they do not need any bag. -- Dr tP    ERRING, YET' NOBLE.        555 gage. You are giving everythinog you have away ; you will have nothing to take with you-where can you be going? You are a strange girl."  So she was, a very strange girl ; and,.what was more, she was going to a very strange place; a place vjhere you and I will go -tosome day ; a place where, as we brought nothing into the world, we cannot carry anything out. A,    ,    e      *   *  I - * After her visitors had left her, room, Fanny Walters bolted and locked the door of the apartment, and sat herself down and thought. Then she arose, and openingc one of the drawers of her bureau, )- the drawer which she always kept locked, and hidden from strangers' eyes, took thence a package of letters, and untied the string which bound it. The first letter she selected was directed to her under the name that was hers in her childhood, and in a bold, sprawling, yet manly hand. It was a letter from her dead father, written years ago, during a visit which she paid to a maiden aunt, who lived at some distance from her own home. As her eyes rested on this letter, a tide of memories rushed upon her soul, and she wept bitterly. But there were other letters connected with the davs of her happiness and innocence. Among the collection -were several notes from her girlhood's lover-from the country clergyman's son, to whom she had once been betrothed. Could it be possi- ble that the broken-down, sad-looking man, whom she had seen for a moment recently in the streets of New York, was the ten- der youth who had kissed her so often in the days of auld lang syne? Again she burst into a fit of weeping. God knows, if sorrow be an atonement for sin, Fanny Walters atoned by anguish. But she recovered herself, and smiling, with g bitter scorn, at her " weaknesse" she carried these letters, threw them into the grate, and saw them burn to ashes. Then she took from the drawer another package : notes from her dead betrayer, under the'signature of, Arthur Hamilton; notes from various women of her own degraded class; notes   556        ERRING, YET NOBLE. from various men, whose acquaintance she had made during her recent career; these, too, she huddled into the grate, and saw devoured by the flalncs. Lastly, she committed to the fire, with many passionate, re- gretful kisses, a bundle of letters received from her little sister, whom she was never to behold again. Then she sat down and performed two very prosaic actions ; she wrote a note to her laundress, enclosing the amount of her last bill, and a trifle over; and then indited a similar epistle to her dressmaker. Then she threw herself upon the bed and closed her eyes; but not in sleep. A knock was heard at the door. "Who's there?" she asked. "Mrs. ----" (naming the landlady or keeper of the house) i" wishes to see you," was the reply. "I cannot come down now," answered Fanny Walters. "Tell Mrs.--   to send for me in an hour." And as she heard the steps of the servant retreating, she muttered to herself, "Yes, in an hour Mrs. may see me, but not as she expects. She will be surprised at my appearance, doubtless." She arose from the bed, took her ink and paper, and wrote hurriedly, We will read what she writes ; it will serve to explain the recent mysteries in her conduct and conversation. -At the top of the manuscript she inscribed this strange direction: "' To the nearest clergyman." She then continued as follows: "Sir, when you read this ,paper I shall be dead; dead by my own hand; and, yet, do not condemn me till yevoll have heard all. I was naturally, I thinlk pure, loving, generous, calculated to make a good woman and a true wife. My father loved me, so did another who was neither- father nor brother; and I loved them both truly. But I was young, thoughtless, inexperienced; I was betrayed under the most atrocious circumstances by a man, handsome, heartless, and thoroughly versed in the arts of   ERRING, YET NOBLE.       557 the world. I fell; my father cursed me; my lover was lost to me; I had henceforth no lover, no father, no home ; and yet, my fall was one more of ignorant folly than of willful error. The heaviest guilt rested on my betrayer, and, yet, I alone suffered. Had any compassion been shown me in my evil hour, perhaps I might have -repented, and, at least, sinned no more. But I blame no one. After all, I killed my father, and broke my lover's heart. I deserved no chance for repentance, and 1 received none. I had no friends, no money. I must live, though a sinner; and so I sinned to live. Would to heaven I had done years ago what I am about to do now. But it was not to be; I was fated to fill up the measure of my iniquities. An unknown woman, with a -brand upon me, how was I to obtain any position in which, whatever talents or knowledge I possessed, might be ren- dered useful? It was impossible; and so I became what, for years, I have been. And once having adopted this life, it was utterly impossible to escape from it. A good woman has visited me two or three times and told me that escape was possible; that I could enter upon a new and pure life; but though she talked sensibly enough, I know she is mis- taken, at least in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases in a thousand; at least in my case. She may think one way on this subject, but I know too well that the rest of the world think another ; and that if I had attempted her plan I would have failed. Neither men -cr women ever forgzie a woman who has fallen by mlaqn. Besides, there was one thing I had proposed to myself--revenge I revenge upon my betrayer! I know, holy sir, you will tell me this revenge was but another sin added to my dark catalogue; and so, at last, I learned to regard it; and I abandoned all desire for personal ven- geance. But I warned my betrayer not to act to other women as he had acted towards me; but my warning was in vain. And so, in a moment of ungovernable passionate instinct, I revenged the wrongs of my sex, as well as my own, upon him. I stabbed him, and he died. I was tried for murder   558       ERRING, YET NOBLE. pleaded my own cause (you have read of it in the papers, doubtless), and was acquitted. /I say, before God, that I do nlot  think that in killing this man I was guilty of murder. But I felt that I ought not now to live much longer in this world. I had blasted the lives of my father and my lover, disgraced the name of my mother, blighted the prospects of my sister; I had added one sinner to the host of sinners on earth ; I was but a public pest, why should I live? I had sent one criminal to his account, why should I :ia fellow-crim- inal, remain behind? Besides, the longer I live the longer I must sin; for, alas! with such as me, life and sin are in- separable and identical; and in a few years I should be not only sinful, but ugly, faded, sick, poor, utterly wretched and degraded. Gdod people have told me that we have no right, ourselves, to end our lives. I know not whether this be so or not. If it is true I call upon God to forgive me; for I' feel an irresistible fatality upon me to die. This fatality I cannot resist, and die I must. The voice of the man I killed seems to call to me from his grave. ' It is now your tuhn,' he cries. I have, at least, one consolation : I have not sinned of late, and the wages of my former evil career have been appropriated to the very best of purposes--the salvation of a sister, who does not know, and never 'will, what I have been. I have paid all my debts; I have remembered all my friends, such as I have ; I have forgiven all my enemies, as I trust heaven will forgive me; I am, at this moment, a, better woman than I have been for years; a better woman than I could long remain were I to live. It is, therefore, as I see it, my part to die. I lhave other reasons for death. I cannot explain them, but the One above me knows them all. I write to you, sir, though I have no claim upon you. I ask you, for the love of the God whom you worship, and -before whom I am soon to appear, to grant me these requests- First, see that I am decently interred (you swill find money for that purpose in a purse in the lowest drawer in my bureau), that I am buried in the quiet country, far from this ,      ERRING, YET NOBLE.       559 noisy, wicked city, in which I have sinned so long; and that no inscription-whatever is placed upon my grave. Second, let the handkerchief and the pocket Bible (keepsakes of two good women, who were very good to me), and the lock of hair, and the ring (mementoes of my dead parents), which you will find in a little parcel upon the table, be buried with me. See them placed with me in the coffin. I shall rest ;better with such pure things about me, I fancy. "Fulfill these requests, sir, the first and last that a poor girl has ever made, or can ever make, of you. Pray for my poor soul. And farewell till the day of Judgment. "She who, while a sinner on earth, was known as "FANNY WALTERS." This singular, solemn, touching epistle, having been writ- ten hastily, red-hot, if we may be allowed the expression, from the heart, Fanny Walters took a slip of paper, and wrote upon it these lines : "i Dear MSrs  , with this you will find a letter addressed 'to the nearest clergyman.' For the love of God, as you must yourself die, I beg of you to see that this letter is put at once into the hands of the first clergyman who can be pro. cured; and do not dispose of my body in any way till the clergyman comes, and then let him arrange all. The letter will tell him what to do. Only see that they bury me in the country, not in the hateful city where I have suffered and sinned. I thank you for all your kindness to me since I have been in your house; you have meant well in your way towards me, but, oh I what a bad way that is. Excuse me for my plain speaking, but now it is my time to speak plain. Oh I leave the life you areleading while you have yet a chance, or else some day, sooner or later, you will follow my terrible example. I leave some money in one of the bureau drawers. Let it be given, in my name, to the neighboring poor, after deducting my funeral expenses. I know of a good lady, Miss Witherson is her name ; she lives -- -- She takes an interest in bad women like us.  If you will repent and forsake your present life (she says we ,  ' -   560       ERRING, YET NOBLE. all can forsake and repent if we choose, though I cannot' she will help you all she can. Call on her at any rate and remind her of her promise to visit my grave some- times. I shall- rest the happier for her visit. Give my last love to all the girls in the house, and tell them to leave the house as soon as possible. Better the almshouse than a place like this. And now, good bye. hMy best wish for you is that we may never meet again; not even in the world to come, if there is such a world. Yet I will be happier even there than here. I have killed my father; I have seen my true lover lately, and the sight of me has blasted him; I have refused my only chance for marriage (George Atherton has asked me to be his wife; but, thank God, I told him 'no ;' I have not his ruin upon my guilty souD; I have sent my betrayer to his account ; I have been a scorn and a curse to others, a pest to society, a torture to myself, and now I go to God. Perhaps He will have more mercy for me than I have for myself--who knows? I wonder what the next world is like. I do so hope that it is not at all like this. Tell Miss 'Witherson to remember me gratefully to that good man, her friend, the Rev. George Howard. He was very kind to me; and tell her that I hope she will herself be very happy with the man she loves; and tell her to kiss Miss Mary Barton (or she who was Mary Barton once-she is married now) good bye for me. And now I must cease writing, I have something much more serious to do. I must be off, where I cannot guess; but out of this world at any rate. Perhaps heaven will deem me, after all, less guilty than some women I have met. I, at least, have been sorely tempted, and have never been a hypocrite. An old man (whose child I saved) blessed me the other day ; I prayed for myself at church of late ; and there are some whom I have benefitted who will pray for me also. -And perhaps these blessings and prayers will follow poor -        FANNY WALTERS." This second letter she directs to Mrs. :--, the landlady of the house, and places it beside the other   ERRING, YET NOBLE.        561 (We would here call attention to one fact. No allusion whatever is made in these!tters by the writer to her sister. On this one point scrupulous silence is preserved. Doubt- less the writer intends that not the slightest hint shall be afforded even of the existence of such a sister, so that the latter shall never, by any chance, learn the shameful secret of the true character of the life that her guardian had led while on this earth.) Having finished these letters, Fanny Walters proceeds to wrap up a little parcel containing " the handkerchief, the pocket Bible, the lock of hair, and the ring," alluded to in her letter to the clergyman, and lays it upon. the table. She then goes to the window and looks out. The street is comparatively quiet, only a cart is passing -and there are but few pedestrians. And yet she gazes upon this peaceful and familiar scene as intently as though it were some thrill. ing dramatic spectacle. Ah, reader, any spectacle will seem dramatic if you know that you are looking upon it for the last time. Fanny Walters then ascends, by a private staircase, to an observatory located on the roof of the house. From there she obtains a fine and extended view of the city of New York, at least of its house tops, each house containing its own Souls, its own Sins, and. its own Sorrows. She gazes north, she gazes south, she gazes east and west; then she looks downward towards the streets, and then up- wards towards the skies, saying nothing even to-herself, but full of utterly and terrifically undescribable emotions. Then she takes from her bosom a small via!, looks once more around her, shudders, hesitates, and then, by a quick motion, raises the vial to her lips; and, after a brief strug. gle, a scream, and a contortion, she falls. Fanny Walters, on this beautiful day, lies in the observatory on the house- top in the great city of New York--dead I After a while the landlady seeks Fanny Walters.  Her room-door is locked. In course of time, alarmed, they break   562          ERRING, YET NOBLE. it open.   The  letters are  there, but the   writer is not. The letters are read and they understand all. The door of the private staircase is ajar. An idea strikes them. They ascend, reach the observatory, and the mystery is plain. Fanny Walters is flow a Mystery. "The nearest clergyman" was sent for. He chanced to be George Howard. Need we say that every roqnest of the dead woman was religiously observed. Fanny Walters sleeps in a country church yard, near the resting place of Hetty Thorpe. Her living sister is a dear, sweet girl, who often sighs for and wonders over her sister departed, whom she will not yet believe to be dead. *      $      *      *       $ Fanny Walters has gone from     this sad worldl.

But into this world. wev have, in'his present work, no time to enter. And we can only say that if we are accused of having made our sinners too interesting, and of having attempted to conceal the darker aspects of their ignorance, filthiness, drunkenness, profanity, riot and dishonesty (aspects which are, alas! real and only too evident), we can simply plead the artistic excuse that too dark a shade is fatal to a picture, and the moral apology that only by presenting the more poetical side of our picture to the world, could we ever hope to prevail upon the world even so much as to glance at it. Do we not stand justified?   EBRINO, YET NOBLE.         568 CHAPTER THE LAST. Now for a few " final words " concerning the various person- ages who have figured in the pages of our book. Katherine Somers (afterwards Hericot) is now Mrs. R--. She is the wife of a rich man of position and influence, who met her subsequent to the death of Henry Hericot, was attracted by her stylish dressing and physical prettiness, offered himself, and was accepted. Katherine really loved Hericot, mourned his loss, after her feeble fashion, had been shocked at his untimely fate, and, for a while, had been more than ordinarily pious. But serious impressions with her were evanescent; the world, fashion, money were all in all. Therefore, when a living man, endowed with the gifts of fortune, was -presented before her, to assume the place of a dead man's memory, she did not long hesitate to decide in favor of the former. So she married Mr. R-- , and is now wealthy, flattered, fashionable; many would prefer her situation to that of Julia Witherson, now Singerly; but how mistaken would such judges be. Katherine is not happy. She feels that Charles and Julia despise her, and that she deserves to be despised ; she contemns herself, for her conscience upbraids her as a hypocrite; she fears death, yet is not able, morally, to prepare for it; her woman's heart, crush it as she may, will, ever and anon, weep over the remembrance of the murdered man, the- only one of her three husbands wlhom she hlas ever loved ; and often, far too often for her peace, the memory of him who died of a broken heart, a heart broken by her crim- inal coquetry, crosses her midnight thought, bringinfg to mind a passage from a book she once read, "that in the day of final reckoning the iname of the coquette will stand next to that of the murderer." Yes, Katherine is wretched. She dresses as elegantly and fashionably indecent as ever, is gay and flattered;   564        ERRIING YET NOBLE. but miserably she lives, and miserably, at last, will she die. And after death, she will learn that many a woman who has never, on earth, technically " fallen," will, by Heaven, be judged more severely than many another woman who has been more despised, but more tempted. Such is the doom of Katherine the hypo. ctrite! But Mary Barton, or the young girl wlhom we knew by that name, and her husband, are as happy as the day is long. And as grateful to their benefactors, Charles and Julia., as they are happy. The Rev. George Howard is meeting with the reward he merits in kind, at least, if not to as great a degree as hs friends would- desire. Of course, "the orthodox" and "the unco righteous" rail at him still; but lie cares not, and the world at large cares not either. All wlho know him love him, and the number of his admirers is rapidly increasing. His pre- sent is happy and honorable, and his future must be bright. The future of such a man as he cannot be otherwise. The world needs just such men. There are too few of them, and the de- mand for them is growing. We hope to see the time when cler- gymen of the present " fashionable " and " orthodox " stripe, the canting, long-visaged, fanatical, or milk and water priests, who have so long served, or mis-served as clerical models, will become mere specimens of the past, and will give place to good, sound, sensible men. Men who eat, and drink, and visit, and patronize the drama and dance; men who have the wisdom of scholars, with the instinct and the pluck of gentlemen ; men, too, who are pure and honest in their lives, sensible in their views, practical in their endeavors, bold and unterrified in their doctrines, with an eye single, not to the " praise of men," but to the "praise of God." IIoward is happy, too, in his domestic and social ties. His wife and he are one fesh and one son! - while his relations with his old friends, Clharles and Julia, are of the most intimate character. He resides near these personages, and sees them daily. They almost worship him, while he returns their love and admiration in the fullest degree. Julia has told   RRINGQ, YET NOBLE.        565 him how a sermon of his, yvears ago, led her to her noble work of woman-redemption (though she has told him nothing moore), and Charles tells- him constantly how much he owes to him spiritually. Mrs. Singerly speaks of him in the highest term;. What more can he, as a friend, or a man, or a clergyman, de- sire?  *       *   *   *   * We may hlere state that the Rev. George Howard keeps a "'note book." , From this we take the subjoined extract, writ- ten one night after witnessing Miss Davenport in Camille. * "Greatest, aye, and it -may be, purest and truest of dramas, I have loved thee, thou play of Camille. "The drama of Camille is of the most interesting descrip tion. Though a drama, alas! of real life, it has an excite ment equal to that of a 'Bowery' piece, combined with the heart-interest of a " domestic play." - One never is wearied beholding it. No low, " comic" underplot mars its beauty, but in gay, yet sad earnestness, they heroine lives, loves, sacri- fices and dies. Oh, it is full of interest, this play of Camille I "The scenes are well contrasted and suggestive. First, the wild, gaiety of Paris, then the love that bursts upon the gay; coquette ; then the- retirement of the country, with all the hopes of a pure attachment glowing in the soul; and next the sudden apparition of a father, and the cloud that dark- ens these glowing hopes ; then the despairing, passionate, yet dissembled parting; then the meeting at a ball, and the lover's frantic curse. And last, the death-bed, the reconcilia- tion, and the death. Oh I they are well contrasted, and - suggestive, indeed, the scenes in this play of Camille I "The characters, too, are well drawn. The ardent, honest lover, the gay, intriguing count, the weak-headed, glorious- hearted St. Frivole, the damnable, comical old Prudence, and the proud parent, are taken from the life. "But how shall we do justice to the character of Camille herself?  Camille, one of the noblest women ever drawn; Camille, a woman, the type of many ; Camille, an erring, yet a noble woman; Camille, who sins, dances, drinks, lavishes extravagant sums upon unworthy objects, and has many   566        ER-rGs, YET NOBLE. lovers ; Camille, who loves, loves passionately and truly, loves fondly and self-sacrificingly, and who gives up the many for the one ; Camille, who abandons her gay life in the city for a loving existence in the country, who wishes for naught save love and her lover ; Camille, who, for her lover's dear ones' sakes, and for his own sake surrenders all her hopes of heaven on earth, and returns to that lonely, crowded life, which is to her now pure heart a hell ; Camille, who patiently bears her lover's curse, and who is faithful to her vow through all agonies; Camille, who dies happy, aye, and holy in her lover's arms. Camille, Camille, outcast, lost one, yet more pure in repentance and devoted, self-sacrificing, self- destroying love than many a woman of most immaculate and icy virtue. Camille, Camille, how shall we do justice to thy slandered worth? "Of course the unco-righteous upbraid us for this euloginm upon a Parisian Cyprian. Pious priests elongate their white cravated throats in surprise at our audacity; and moral mammas hold up their hands in horror at our unblushing libertinism. Still, spite of priests and mothers, we, declare upon our honor that Camille, in the much-abused, yet popular play of that name, is at heart a pure, and most certainly a noble and penitent woman; and that, therefore, the morai tendencies of the play itself are good, spite the clamor against it; which clamor, bythe-bye, comes from those who have never seen the play, and who, if they had seen it, would not have been capable of appreciating it. "Camille, though thou wert a Parisian, and a Cyprian, we honestly believe that at the last great day of Judgment, when all are guaged by their hearts, thou wilt find upon tlry Judge's face a smile of pardon, such as he bestowed in hs olden; human days upon repentant Mary Magdalene. "Camille, pure, sweet, loving, sacrificing, hoping, repent- ing, dying Camille farewell, for a while--farewell!"' In regard to this extract, we would simply remark that In admiration of the play, and appreciation of its heroine, we agree with the. Rev. Howard.  But we believe that Du-   ERRING, YM' NOBLE.         567 mas has not carried the moral of his drama far enough. Dumas seems to think that the only way a woman who errs can atone is by love and death. We believe that a better way of atonement is by a life of repenltanzce and practical good- ness: Believing this, we have written lthis bcok. *  .   *          * ,         * As for Mrs. Singerly, she considers herself the happiest mother in New York city or State. She loves her children, dotes upon her little grandchild, the baby-daughter of Charles and Julia, and seems twenty years younger than she did in the old wretch- ed time of the past. She is honored and loved by her family, she is revered by all who know her, she is destined, probably, to a long life, certainly to a happy death. What more can mortal creature ask?  One or two changes are noticable -about Mrs. Singerly. She has more mercy on "fast" young men than she had formerly, she speaks to them kindly, is hopeful for them, reproves them gently and sensibly, and -has consequently reformed several. She is also less bigoted in religious matters, and often accompanies her children to churches which are by no means generally deemed ' orthodox." Especially do we notice, that she hlas more pity and less censure for the frail ones of her own sex. She prays for them more and scorns them less. As for Charleg, she still adores him. He is still her "idol boy." And perhaps she has learned to lo:e Julia almost as deeply and tenderly as her own son. Certainly she respects her as truly as though she were Victoria, queen of England. And words cannot adequately express the bliss that fills the wedded lives of Charles and Julia ; the. joys that compass all their days. Only they who have exquisitely suffered and sor- rowed, like them, can, like them, be rendered exquisitely blessed. God be thanked, our capacity for pain is also the guage of our capacities for pleasure. Heaven be praised, even the memory of agony is an additional drop in the cup of present happiness. And so our lovers, for they are lovers still, are full of joy, alike in having learned the lessons of the past, in enjoying the delights that each day brings with it, and in looking forward to a cloud-   568        ERRING, YET NOBLE. less future; cloudless, we call it, for whatever else may befall that future must be serene which is destined to be illumined by the sunshine of love. Charles is as "-steady 1' as he is happy-he has had his fill of dissipation; he is also as careful as he was formerly careless. He is liberal, generous, charitable in pecuniary matters, but is not loose or reckless; keeps accounts, and is a good business man. He is also particular in his friendships and associations; he has respected Hericot's nmemory and paid his debts ; but he has no more such " friends.'" He is a conservative in politics and religion ; takes an interest in both, but goes to extremes in neither. He has also become a conservative in literature, writes both prose and poetry, but indites less wildly than was his-wont; and writes with a practical purpose, to benefit as well as delight the public. In his writings, lie often alludes to the sub- ject of woman, and he treats this delicate theme so delicately, that it is evident that he has "learned from   experience." Charles is also very liberal to the brothers of his craft, and many a struggling author has been relieved by him. In his domestic relations, Charles is truly to be envied. His love to his mother, great as it is, is fully reciprocated ; while his love for his wife surpasses all other feelings. And his respect for her equals his affection. She has been to him, indeed, a vir- tuous and true wife; she has proved " a crown of honor to her husband." And Charles is true to her in every thought of his life. He has learned, by the past, that error in a man is as criminal and dangerous as error in a woman ; thlat seduction is equivalent to murder; and the story of Hetty Thorpe and Henry Hericot have taught him lessons that he never will forget. He is a truly happy and a truly moral man I And Julia is a worthy companion for such a man as Charles. She retains her old fondness for expenditure, but is less extrava- gant; and as she spends more moneyvupon others than on her- self, we must pardon her. She is proud, too, but somewhat more subdued than formerly.  She is studious still, but her themes are less abstruse and more useful ; and her musical abili-   ERRING, YET NOBLE.         569 ties are brought, spite her marriage, into constant activity. She practices chiefly upon the piano oil which she performed that eventful night when she made the acquaintance of old Shiner, having purchased this instrument from her friend the widow, and keeping it as a memento of the eccentric miser to whom she is so deeply indebted. She is very charitable, and does a vast deal of good. She is a high-toned, talented, glorious, cha rming woman-and so loving, and so beloved I The very best of wives and mothers, and daughters, as old Mrs. Singerly will vouch for. Occasionally memories of the past visit her ; she muses upon Hericot and Kate Somers; but she pities and forgives them. Sometimes, too, she shudders at the recollection of her old wick- ed theories of marriage and religion, and at the shame to which they led. This recollection is most exquisitely painful. It is an agony, every moment of which is more than a year of ordinary sorrow.  It is the one drop   of poison in the life-cup of Julia. It is the one woe for which There is no balm.  But the pang   is as brief as bitter.  She feels that, though once a " fallen woman," she has risen, has atoned, and is now pure and pardoned. One thing, however, she never forgets, one thing is never absent long from her thoughts, her desire and determination to benefit and rescue the degraded of her own sex. She sees that those she saved are kept safe; she also takes heed to the salvation of others. She does all this now quietly and indirectly, but she does it effectually, neverthe- less. And God only knows the full extent of the great good she is doing. She has been taught that society is directly re- sponsible for immorality-and that, after all, it is not the only social evil in existence-and she will never forget her teaching. And she is happy. Ah, reader, there is no bliss like that en- joyed by those who have erred and strayed, have suffered, re- pented, atoned, and been forgiven. And that all who have thus silned, may thus he saved, is the principal lesson of this our book. Hereafter, when we encounter a woman who is " erring," let us see to it that we endeavor to develope in her that better nature, which is truly " loble!"     rJOHN BiADB UtN'-S LA TB? bUBLICATIONS.

LA TE?UBLICA TIOY2S. BATTLE FIELDS OF OUR FATHERS. BY VIRGINIA F. TOWNSEND. This volume, the scene of which is laid in time of the REVOLUTION, is offered to the public, with the conviction that it will address itself -at once to the hearts of the American people. The story opens with the Autumn preceding the Revolutionary War, and follows it down its long path of seven years' struggle and suffering to that great victory which crowns them at last. The whole volume presents a picture of the social, domestic, and religious life of our fathers and mothers, while one especial charm of the book is its perfect naturalness. The heroine, GRACE PALMER, is the ideal woman of the Revolution. Of the moral tone of the book the publisher need not speak; the author's name is an ample assurance of its earnestness and purity of purpose. The book should find a welcome in every home.

We have it on the authority of the Edinburgh Review, that the novels of this gifted authoress were "published at the expense of the Queen." The same authority remarks, " hence it might have been foretold, that of the vari- ous kinds of novels, the romantic and descriptive was the least repugnant to the old Spanish spirit, and that in order for a writer successfully to undertake such a novel, it would be necessary for him to have a passionate attachment -to the national manners and characteristics, and a corresponding dislike to the foreign and new; such are the qualities we find united in Fernan Caballero." "La Gaviqta is, perhaps, the finest stm'y in the volumes." Its advent is a real literary event. The most severe critics have dissected this new work, and have unhesitatingly proclaimed the authoress to be the "SPANISH WALTER SCOTT." Among the painters of manners, the best, without doubt, are the Spanish writers. We are certain to find their truth joined to a richness and piquancy of details, and above all, a spirited tone which singularly heightens and sets -off their recitals.
