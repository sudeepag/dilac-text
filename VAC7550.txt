               THE TINKER SPY.  BY JAMES REES, AUTHOR OF "DARK DAYS OF PHLADELPHA,^ "MYSTERIES OF CITY LIFE," "THE FACTORY BOY," ETC. ETC.   In this story, figure some of the most celebrated men of the period at which it commences, 1775, viz: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, Livings- ton, Lee, Cornwallis, tHoe, and other leading men of the councils and the armies. The scenery and the mysteries of the Wissahickon; the-reminiscenceS of Bush Hill; the Old Brewhouse in Dock Street; the State Houge; the Block Houses; Walnut Street Prison, and the scenes of horror therein perpetrated, are all truthfully and powerfully portrayed. The author has thrown around the incidents of this story an air of reality, which his correct descriptior, of scenery, old houses and places, fully sustains. We seem to wander over the fields of the olden time, on which are now erected costly buildings; we are carried back to the Loxley-House in its early days, Bath- aheba's Bath, and the Garden of Flowers. Again we see the events of the Fourth of Jul, 1776; we seem to hear the shout of the populace on the outside of the old State House, and the excited oices of the patridts within; once more the old bell seems to ring as it did on that day. We are coiducted into the private residence of Benjamin Franklin; we are placed side by side with him at his little square table, and there, among his friends, we listen to the words which produced the DECLARATION ( JNn IPES nND NDC. The author's description of this event is vivid in the extreme, and will be read with interest. Then comes the struggles of Washington's little-a ; his retreat : his attacks on Trenton, Princeton, scenes with the Hessians, etc. In all, andarough all, the TINKER SPY figures conspicuously.-Philadelphia Sunday Mercury.

TO ONE WHO HAS BEEN TO ME THRBOUGT ALL THE VARYINt SOENE8 OF LITF  THS LITTLE WORK IS WITH THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION DEDICATED TO ti WIFE- THE AUTHOR. PHLADELPHA, June, 185     PREFACE. Works of fiction, having for their basis the mere coinage of a luxuri- ant brain and fertile imagination, must materially operate against those productions having a more solid and truthful foundation. Historical novels, treating of other lands and other scoenes, have, it is true, more interest for the general reader than those which treat of our own. This arises from the-fact that their literary treasures have been accumulating since the days of Alfred, Bede, and Ohauoer, through a succession of ages, leveling up the vast catalogue of science with the most -enlightened and intellectual names that have gilded the firmament of letters in any, age or hemisphere;while ours can scarcely be estimated at more than ' half a century at least. We do not, be it understood, condemn romance, for if; ,e did, ours  G should not have had its second title. There are romanc-es having no foundation in history or in truth, that always remind us ok playful dreams, passing away and sparkling over the brain like the short-lived meteors of the air. Such works amuse, delight, but seldom instruct. But there is still another class, in which the worst features of crime and passion are fearfully painted and as fearfully distorted.. Let us endeavor to avoid both of these, and furnish to the rising generation a series of works founded .upon the startling scenes which are to be found in the history of our own country. That we have material for such produc- tions, no one will deny; and if they should lack the interest which the Age of chivalry affords, they would, at least, abound in all else that is calculated to make us love that land- the more, by placing- to the view, in the most pleasing and striking manner, its history, and that of those who labored to give it place among the nations of the earth. From the landing of the Pilgrim  Fathers, to the occasion of the last war, and its brilliant results, there are startling scenes for the pen of our novelists, which would, in the most emphatic manner, prove that well- known adage, "Truth is stranger than fiction." * Enlist our youth in the cause of their country's literature, excite their imaginations by historic tales, and not by the mere force of romance: -then will our native authors labor to exalt a standard,'where, as' yet,   XIV '            PREFACE. none is to be seen. The names of Simms and Cooper are identified with its early dawn-suffer it not to make an inglorious set, but rather endeavor to make it like "Yung day pouring in apace, Opening all the dawny prospect wide." l We are'not vain enough to imagine this little work can add much to assist the "young day" of our literature, but if it induces one of the bold and aspiring youths of this. age to study our country's history for   A the purpose of finding out how much truth and how much romance is * in it, our object has been attained. History is earth's bible-study it well We annex the following, which originally appeared in the edito- rial columns of the American Quarterly Review.^ It speaks volumes for us. v "We do not wish to be understood as making an appeal to the national feelings, an indisperiable;requislte in all American productions; but we do mean to say, that such appeals, when introduced with genuine senti- ment, and without affectation, are proper and praiseworthy. They are equally advantageous to "the author and the reader. They give to the productions of. the former all that peculiar and decisive interest-derived from an astiation of theijefforts of the mind, with manners, incidents, and local aifectons,'and they instill into the latter a more powerful feel-  * ing of patriotism. Every man contemplates his country with a greater degree of affection and pride when he sees its happiness, virtues, and glories commemorated by genie, in a manner which evinces that he who thus celebrates them is himself worthy of admiration. There are so few writers of powerful creative imagination, that it savors of a base desertion to withdraw their genius from the service of their country, and devote those powers which were bestowed by Providence for higher purposes, to themes and exploits having no communion with her situa- tion and history. The best and most permanent foundation for fame is our native soil, ands a mai who is admired or beloved by his own coun- trymen, may almost dispense with the praise, of the world."   THE TINKER SPY: A ROMANCE OF THE REVOLUTION. CHAPTER I. ,  "Tell me, niy friend, from whence hadst thou the skill, So nicely to distinguish good from ill; Or by the sound to judge of gold and brass, What piece is tinker's metal, what w,il- pass," "Well, here I am! let me see. Ah! yonder is Hl-niion's place. I know it well; many a good blade have I sharpened for Iis old house- keeper. She was a good soul! but let that pass-memory is but a dream, which stern reality soon dispels. So I have traveled twenty miles since morning; it is now about two o'clock, and I feel somewhat disposed to rest, I wish I had a glass of'good whisky, it would freshen me up a little."  So saying, the speaker, having cast his eyes around and selected a shady place, threw himself full length on the green sward. It was a delightful day in June, the sun was partly obscured by occa- sional clouds, but there was no indication of a storm, and thus the heat was partly kept in abeyance by those ifitervening awnings which nature supplies for the benefit of ungrateful man. The reader may judge, from the expression of the traveler, something of the locality of the place. The spot he selected to rest upon, was on the road leading from Market Street Bridge, up through the woods, to what thWen, and in after years, -was known as Hamilton's place. What a change in the' general aspect of the scene from what it was then, wild and romantic, and is at the present day, a part and portion of our vast city. Now brick walls shut out rural sights and sounds; the hum of labor is echoed back from marble-fronted structures, heavily laden vehicles roll over well-paved streets; and ,the steam and smoke of a large city rise toward heaven, dimming the azure of the canopy above. Then, the slowly meandering Schuylkill was shadowed, by towering sycamores and noble oaks, and all the intermediate woods were crowded with grape-vines and whortleberry bushes. Hills, valleys, and deep, dark woods lay around. The eastern bank, for numbers of squares, was ,   ,16           THE -TINKER SPY. almost a wilderness; nor was it until the traveler reached Broad street, that he could recognize the city proper. Apple orchards, and a few scattering oaks gave it the appearance of a newly-settled country. Within our remembrance, Logan Square was a kind of Potter's Field: deep gullies ran through it; the ground was uneven and rugged; and, in after years, we witnessed there the gallows-tree, with- its human fruit suspended from its branches. The same, with the exception of the gallows, can be said of Washington Square, then, more than now, in the center of the city. It was called Potter's Field; and although, as we have said, it could not boast of its gallows, it had its whipping-post. Within our recollection, the houses on the street along the south side% of the Square, were as miserable and irregular a set of negro-huts and 'sheds as could well be imagined. In 1745, the spot of ground upon which the Presbyterian Church now stands, was a duck-pond, and those fond of the-sport used to go there to shoot wild ducks. We could give many strange and startling incidents connected with this now beautiful spot. The ground over which numbers of bright, happy children are accustomed to sport and play, is mingled with-the blood and bones of a portion' of the great human family. Pits were dug there deep and long, into which, during the prevalence of what, in 1777, was called the camp fever, the bodies of twp thousand soldiers were placed; while in 1793, it was nothing more nor less than a       F Golgotha and a ghastly receptacle of the dead,. From that'period, or at leastafte,:l796, it ceased to be a Potter's Field, but, until 1815, it remained a disgrace to the city, being merely a receptacle for-the filth and dirt of th surrounding neighborhood. From this description of what Washington Square was then, our readers can form some idea of the locality we have-selected as the     ? opening scene of our legend./  While upon the subject of i:he olden time, and as it will give the    - reader a somewhat better idea of the wild beauty and romance of the     ( Schiylkill river and its banks, we annex the .following description of one spot, which Watson furnishes in his interesting "Annals of Phila- delphia:"           -              - On the banks of the SchuynilU, at the end of Spruce street, there was, in, the early times of this city, an oak grove, selected by the Baptist i society as:, a Baptisterian, to lead their initiates into the river to be baptized, as did John in Enon. "'Morgan Edwards, their pastor, who describes it as he saw it before the year 1770 (he arrived here in 1758), says of it: 'Aroundsaid spot    t are large'oaks, affording fine shade; under foot is a green, variegated   \ with wild flowers and aromatic herbs, and a tasteful house is near by for dressing and undressing the Proseuches.' In the midst of the spot was a large stone, upon the dry ground, and elevated above it about three feet-made level on the top by art, with hewn steps to ascend it. Around this rock the candidates knelt to pray, and upon it the preacher stood to preach to the people. 'The'place was not only convenient for the purposes used, but also most delightful for rural scenery, inducing people to go thither in summer as a place of recreation.' To such a place resorted Francis Hopkinson, Esq., with. his bards and literati, to   THE TINKER SPY.           17 -sweep their lyres, or to meditate on justice and religion. What a shame that all these rural beauties have long since been effaced and forgotten! none of them left to remind us of those rural appendages, woods, &c." Our story opens at an important era in the history of our country, being, shortly after Franklin's return from England, in 1775. he was in his seventieth year. The position which the philosopher and states- man then occupied, was one calculated to bring. him immediately before the people, in the great work which was then going on. At this time, while the surrounding colonies were, by force of arms, asserting their independence, Philadelphia was comparatively quiet-that is, as regards outward appearance, but there was a deep under-current of feeling, flowing through all ranks of society-the awful stillness that precedes some mighty outhurst of nature. And it came-England trembled- nations stood aghast at the'daring of a handful of men! The colonists, themselves, were astonished. Yes, from that quiet city, which did not, at first, appear active in the war, proceeded that document-which pro- claimed to the world, "WE ARE?FEE!"-that document, the like of which was never seen, and never will be-- "THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE."  Then the war'may be said to have commenced in earnest. England found the infant cSlonies had sprung into full man- hood, unawares; she found no cravens, puny, sickly babes, to shrink in -terror from the lion rampant:--no! but men-megn of the revolution I France gazed with admiration on the young eagle pluming itself for a. mighty contest, and with a nobleness worthy the cause, sent aid, for which, she will receive the heartfelt thanks of the whole American people. We have stated, that Franklin was in a position to effect much in the great struggle about to take place. The affair at Lexington, had just occurred, andin the language of the philosopher himself, "All America was exasperated, anal more firmly united than ever." He was appointed,  by the Assembly, a member of the Committee of Safety, in whose arduous duties, as we shall have occasion to show, he participated. He was chosen on the sixth of May, 1775,. the very next day after his arrival in the city, a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia on the tenth of the same month. He was also appointed a member of the Secret Committee, for procunnring sup- plies and munitions of war for the army; and was also deputed in the autumn, one of the committee to proceed to Cambridge,! and confer with General Washington on the more efficient mode of'organizing the army. Upon his return from this mission, the old patriot found that he had been elected, by his fellow-citizen s, a delegate to the State Assembly. As the interest of our story is more or less identified with the events arising out of that period, and in circumstances in which Franklin will take part, we have deemed it necessary to give this por- tion of our revolutionary history a place, as being important to explain the actions and motives of some of our characters, Let us now return to, the hero of our story.   18           HE TINER sPy. CHAPTER II. * What kings decree,.the soldiers must obey."--DYDsr. t "Please you, sir, this is my" brother, 'And please you, sir, this is my sister."--OLD PLAY. Our hero, as we before observed, having laid himself down beneath the branches of an old, gnarled oak, his hand came in contact with a package; which hle had carefully secured in the pocket of his coat. "Ah I" he exclaimed, "what am I to do with this cursed packet .  I wish I had not undertaken the task of delivering it; it may lead me into some difficulty. Bet me see.  'To B-e-n-j-a-min Franklin.' Well, as I live, this is directed to the man who holds communion with the clouds by means of a kite, and brings down, they say, lightning by the flash. . And he is a philosopher, too-a great man; well, I will deliver it to him. Ah! what have we here!"     This exclamation was uttered as he glanced down the lane. "'As I live, it is the guard;. curses upon them, they hang around the skirts of the town, as iuzzards do over the carcass of some dead beast. These vultures are to be dreaded. Power, they say, is mighty and must prevail. -But, this package !-suppose it should contain treason?  I must guard it well, or my neck will be endangered." At that moment, an officer, at the head of four men, came in full view of the traveler. The former, as he got a glimpse of him, shouted out, '"What! ho thered! who are you i" "A friend, Corporal."                              . "What are you doing here, hiding under the trees ?" "I am only resting, being tired of traveling; I am on my way to the city."  "What business have you mi the city, eh.?" :"Business? look here; do you not see my implements of trade " "A TINKER !" 'Yes, a mender of brass kettles, copper, tin, iron and sometimes steel."  "Ah! 'you steal, do you?" "Corporal, that joke is rather severe, but I forgive you its wit." "You seem to be a shrewd fellow, yet I must examine you; these are ticklish times."                               - "Yes, and I feel devilish ticklish about the neck-but I must secure this package," he muttered in an undertone, while, by a dexterous move- ment, he slipped it from his pocket, and held it behind his back, tightly grasped in his hand. "Search me!    And pray what for, Corporal ?" "Ah, my good friend, that is -to be seen. We have reasons to believe that, in despite of our constantly watching the movements of the rebels, there is a constant communication kept up between the army at Valley Forge and the leading men of the party in the city. And mark me, Tinker, if I find you one of those rascals, who, in despite of threats, ^ .  THE TINKER SPY.            19 shout about liberty, and throw up their caps, and talk of taxation and all such d----  nonsense, I'll have you whipped." "Whipped! Look here, Mr. Corporal, it strikes me that if we are to have a little conversation together, you had better drop such expletives; for the moment a lash is laid upon my lback, there are those by every tie, human and divine, to resent it." 4"Ah! I comprehend.  You are a member of that secret society called 'The Mystic Order.' Aha! is'it soi"* "No, sir; I know nothing of secret orders: but I have friends; even the poor man has these." The Corporal whispered apart to his men. While doing so, the Tinker let the packet fall to the ground, and placed his foot upon it. "Come, fellow, submit to a search. Here, boys, examine his pockets, while I hold his arms." Duiring the operation, the Tinker never moved, but submitted quietly to the indignity, for everything depended on coolness and seeming acqui- escence. After examining the contents of his pockets, and finding no- thing to justify a detention of his person, the Corporal bade him go about his business, remarking: "Look, here, Tinker, I will have an eye on you." "If you do, I will d- d quick gouge it out," muttered he, as the guard passed on its way. "Well, I think I did them there," exclaimed the Tinker, laughing heartily; "and now to grind my military knife. I call this my military, and it is well worthy the name." So saying he arranged his implements, and taking from a box fastened to his hand-barrow (to which was attached a grindstone), a large knife, he was soon busily engaged, as Shakespeare has it, "laboring in his vocation." While thus occupied, we must call the attention of the reader to another part of the- lane, immediately behind the tree unde? which the Tinker had, for the time being, taken up his quarters. Had he, at that moment, turned his head, he would have noticed the approach of two persons, whose appearance would have attracted his attention, from the fact, that one was a very pretty girl, and the other a ladrof quite prepossessing appearance, although both of them evidently belonged to that class, known then, and in after days, as "laboring people."  This distinction, however, was more marked at. that period than it is at present, for the Revolution revolutionized mind, as well as man. The sound of their voices at last attracted the attention of the Tinker, who, being partly hidden from- their view by the intervening. branches, stopped the motion- of his wheel, and was, for a while, amus ed with * During the progress of our Revolution, there were numerous secret societies in existence, all tending to further the cause. "The Mystic Order " was perhaps the most secret, while it was the most powerful; and while it could boast of having some of the first men of the day enrolled among its members, it could also be censured for having some of the worsts The celebrated Doane family were amembers. The "Leather Apron Club," of which Franklin was a member, was one that could date its origin as far back as 1728."   26          THE THE ER SPY. their innocent prattle. As a portion of their conversation, however, has-a direct bearing upon certain events in this romance, we 'will com- mence at that point as having a connecting link with the chain encom- passing the whole. "Come along, Sis, you are always lingering behind, so you are." "Oh! Peter," exclaimed a female voice, in reply, "I am so tired, and it is yet many miles to Philadelphia." "Far--nonsense-only three miles; and what are three miles to us, that have traveled twenty I So come along." "Do let me sit down here a bit, won't you, Peter?" 'Well, Sis, you may rest a little .bit, but, mind, only a minute. One would suppose you would want to fly, going, as you are, to be a waiting- maid to Miss Clayton." "Miss Clayton!" was uttered by the Tinker, in accents loud enough to attract the attention of Peter, who, looking around, and seeing no one, attributed the repetition to ari echo.' "But, Peter, observed his sister, "the voice was a hoarse one." "That is easily accounted for," remarked he, "the echo has caught cold." The Tinker, since the utterance of that name, seemed more interested in their conversation, and as 'he threw himself again on the grass, he muttered, "I must hear more."     : "Yes, Peter, I am glad, and only wish I could fly; but I have no wings--angels, you know, have wings, and I am not. an angel." "Nowg, Jane, don't say so; you are an angel, wings or no wings. In my opinion, they woiuld not make a woman any better in this world, for if they had wings, the Lord knows into what mischief they would not "Then, Peter, they say Miss Clayton is good." 'And your six shillings a week, and found at that; you know, Sis. how fond you are of good things,- eh " "Yes, and I can buy a blue ribbon."  "There you go' again-always thinking of dress-dress. Now here am I, without a shoe to my. foot, and you have the impudence to talk of blue ribbons-it is-en6ugh to give me the blue devils; and then father says, we are taxed over head and cars--that I guess is what they -call We head-tax; besides, he says, 'a penny saved is a penny earned.' ' Hark, Jane, what is that "-  "Oh, brother, they are soldiers! what shall we do t" "Do --why nothing --'they won't harm us." The guard that now approached was the same that had just passed, alid which so unceremoniously searched the Tinker. The leader, espy- ing-Jane and her brother, exclaimed: 'Eh,- what now Who are you? Where do you come from? By heavens, that i a beautiful girl; she is a country gem, fit only for city' life." As he fixed his eyes intently upon her, his bold manner called up a blush to her cheek, and she modestly held down her head, to avoidhis too apparent -purpose of insulting her both by word and actions. "Come hither, miss; what's your name " said he, in a loud voicae   THE TINKER SPY.           21 "Jane Morris, please you, sir." "It does please me-you please me-that lad pleases me--and I am really-so well pleased, that I will take you with me; you shall be my housekeeper." "Oh, sir, I have a place." '"But I will provide you with a better."  The state of society at that period, and even much later, was not one of the most moral character, and the conduct of the British soldiery towards the Americans was of the most gross and brutal description. The consequence of this was, that many violent rencounters took place, in which, strange as it may appear, the soldiery always came off second best. Peter, who had, up to this moment, watched the whole with a quiver- ing lip and sparkling eye, no sooner saw the motion of the officer to seize hold of his sister, than he stepped between them, and exclaimed: "Stand back, sir, this is my sister." "Sister! ha, ha, ha! more like a sweetheart!" "Well, a sweetheart, if you like. Keep your hands off " "Oh! here is treason! Boy, stand aside!-beauty is one of King George's subject's luxuries; and we claim all such for ourselves. You are a mere subject; I am an officer." "Yes, we are subjects, and you are an officer-we are the people, and you are our servants." "Treason! by heaven. Well, my lad, you are a cute one; but as pretty girls are scarce, I do not think I go beyond my authority, if I claim this'one for myself, and press her into service." "I 'll do all the pressing, master; and perhaps it would be better if you would do all the marching." The leader of the party, who was evidently struck by the appearance of the girt, and having all the prejudices of his country against those who were opposing the acts of the king, his master, felt little disposed to extend to the woman that courtesy ever due to the sex; so, with little ceremony, he made a movement toward ;her, when the Tinker, who- had- watched the whole scene, sprang forward from his rural retreat, into the presence of the party, and thus addressed the officer: '"Look here, Mr. Corporal, I have heard sufficient of the conversation between you and these young people, to satisfy me that you intend to carry your insolence a step too far; pass on, attend .to your duty, and let these two young folks go on their way." "Ah! Mr. Tinker, is that you skulking about here yet! I begin to suspect some plot. Out of my path, sir!" ' "Not a step, Mr. Corporal. Nay, frown not, I am not a man to tremble at a look, nor at the sight of a sword; I am used to the storms and tempests of life, so put up your weapon, lest my long knife here should feel disposed to try its quality." D. "o you threaten me, villain 8" ,  "Villain--' look you, sir-we are 'but two; you have four men well armed to do your dirty work; the word villain affects me not, for 'i the estimation of your kine, this whole country is made. up of them, and I aim but an inferior; but touch a single hair of that girl, attempt the least   22           THE TINKER SPY. outrage, and by the heavens above us, I 'll show you what two men can do in defence of all they hold dear. Stand by me, Peter." "Won't I, Mr. Tinker-this good stick, like myself, grew on the soil -it is not so green as it looks. Stand back, Sis." This bold and unexpected movement on the part of the two men took the Corporal by surprise, and as he cast his eyes towards his com- rades, he soon discovered by their looks that he could not rely upon much aid from them. To make the most of a bad beginning, by a sort of bravado ending, he turned towards the Tinker, and with all ,the ma- lignancy of his nature convulsing every feature, he hissed, as it were, these words: "I will mark you, sir! and the time will come when you shall pay dearly for this day's work." "When that day\comes, sir," replied the Tinker, 1" you will find I am prepared to liquidate the debt." As the Corporal and his four men moved slowly down the road, Pe- ter grasped the hand of their deliverer, and in the joyousness of the moment, exclaimed:' "By Jupiter, Mr. Tinker man, but you are a-rare one-that was boldly done--let me squeeze that hand again-it is a stout one. Come, sir, what are you moping about, eh " "And what have you to say, my pretty girl?" "Nothing, sir; I can only thank you." "It is all I ask; and now, as I partly know your object in visiting Philadelphia, and as we are going the same way, let us move on together --we have a long walk yet." "Yes-take my arm, Sis. Mr. Tinker, I will carry your kettle; now let us see who dare molest us." As the Tinker arranged his implements, he could not resist the temp- tation of stealing an occasional glance at Jane, and as if satisfied with the result, he muttered to himself, "She is truly beautiful." We leive them -now wending their way along the road, and passing over an interval of a few darys, we introduce our readers to another and more important char:acter in this legend. CHAPTER III. Franklin's quiet memory climbs to heaven, Calming the lightning which he thence has riven, Or drawing from the no less kindled earth Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth.-BYRON. - In a large room of an old-fashioned house, some three days after the events we have narrated, sat a man upon whose brow was stamped, as with a seal dipped in fire, the impress of genius; not that evanescent  glow of:tihought which gives to the world poetic gems; but a solid, ma- terial, and' intellectual trait, denoting firmness of purpose, power of will, ,               -  ^   '   THE TINKER SPY.            23 and deep philosophical research. Indeed the very chamber was indica- tive of the spirit of the man. On the walls a few choice paintings were somewhat irregularly placed. High shelves, reaching to the ceiling, were filled with books, rolls of parchment, newspapers, End pamphlets. There were two tables in the room, oblong in shape, which were liber- alyi strewn with manuscripts and all the paraphernalia of an editor's or, author's office. One of the most striking of the pictures alluded to was a portrait, evidently intended for the occupant of the room, but taken at a much earlier period of his life. In one corner of this picture, on a small square piece of paper, was written these words: "Painted by B. West."   Beside this, suspended by a blue ribbon, was a miniature profile, done by Wedgrewood, in white china, finely delineated; also one as a medal, evidently executed by a French artist. But the most re- markable ornaments to the room were a large electrical apparatus and an old printing press; thus presenting to the eye of an observer a mixed collection of all that appertains to science and literature. We have said that the most remarkable ornaments of the room were the last two articles named. Not so; for the occupant was beyond doubt the first and last object that would have riveted the gaze of a stranger. He was far advanced in years, and as he sat by a small desk, with his head partly inclined, and his'right hand pressed upon his forehead, he seemed the embodiment of a thought. In appearance he was large in proportion to his height, square built, and inclining to corpulency; and although the period of which we speak would have justified his wearing a wig, yet he wore his own hair, which was thin and gray. The head being large, destroyed all claim to that of a classic school, ,and it stood, as it were, unfashioned upon a figure by no means of the Grecian order of beauty. Yet the countenance was mild, firm, and expressive, and bore the. evidences of health and vigor. Years of strife, years of high excite- ment, both mental and physical, had passed over the old man's head. 'The very elements started back at his daring, and even nations whis- pered his name with fear and trembling. Thus he sat in deep study. The very cause in which his soul was engaged-the cause of his country's freedom-was to him, at that mo- ment, as a dream. Other, and, as some think, higher thoughts were exciting his brain. At the moment we introduced him to our readers, he was occupied upon a scientific subject Benjamin Franklin was re- solving in his mind some question in electricity, started by the French philosopher, Dubourg. Our readers are now acquainted with the occupant of the room. After he had, as it were, made up his mind either to accept or reject the theory, he arose, and walking up and down the room for a few sec- onds, he gave vent to his thoughts in words. B . I cannot reconcile this theory. The earth is a great magnet; that philbsophy teaches us; but as to the magnetism, which seems to be produced by electricity, my real opinion is that these two powers of   24           THE TINKER SPY. nature have no affinity to each other, and that the apparent production of magnetism-is purely accidental. I must examine into this. M. Du- bourg is in error, and I will tell him so. Opinions advanced by me, and now being made the subject of learned discussions in Europe, must be backed by such proofs as experiments alone can furnish. Let me see; where is his letter 8-"  He went to one of the tables alluded to, and, while in the act of searching for the letter of M. Dubourg, picked up a 'peculiarly folded note. He opened it, and, reading its contents, smiled as only such a man could smile; a man who, having perfect confidence in himself and his compatriots, was not to be intimidated by the expressed fears of an anonymous writer. The letter contained these words: "Be on your guard. The spies of Great Britain surround you; they watch your every motion; the hemp is being sown on English soil, to reap a glorious harvest. Protect your neck!--MrsTI." "Protect my neck?-rather my head. Yet there is some deepmqean- ing in these notes. It was but the other day I was told-and the proofs accompanied the letter-that my servant was a spy, and took notes and memoranda of my papers, and of conversations that occurred in this very chamber. I would-I knew something of this association. Its-op- erations are, no doubt, as formidable as they are secret. On the eve of an event involving the destiny of our country, these hints are ominous. Affairs are now assuming a serious aspect, and I must, for the present, postpone my letter to M. Dubourg. Science for a time must yield to more startling matters, and the great question of liberty or death 'must be discussed before that of natural philosophy." At that moment the door opened, and a servant maid announced a young man from the country, who had been, she remarked, -recom- - mended by Mr. Sherman. "Ah! well, Sally, send him in. I have been expecting' him. My friend vouches for his honesty, simplicity, and patriotism. He might have omitted the word honesty, inasmuch as true patriotism is honesty." Sally now appeare/d at the door, and as she stepped aside, there en- tered the young man called Peter, whom we have already alluded to. It was a curious meeting. Benja:nin Franklin, the patriot and sage, stood gazing at his newly appointed servant, who shrank beneath the penetrating glance from eyes undimmed by age, and whose fixedness had created terror in other lands, and in the hearts of other and far more exalted personages than the poor country lad who now stood tim- idly before him. "Well, sir," exclaimed the philosopher, "my name is Benjamin Frank- lin; and yours is"- "Peter, sir; plaid Peter.' "$Plain Peter; a good and unsophisticated name. So my friend Sher- man sent you, did he --ay; and you want a place?" ' "* Yes, sir-a sort of one." "With me, Peter, it will be just such a one as you name. What can you doi,Peter, eh 8 ' ("Everything, sir; that is, I am willing to do anything, and am anx- ious-to learn, so that I can make myself useful."    THE TINKER SPY.           25 "I want a lad to keep this room in order, and dust and arrange my books and papers; without-now remember-without removing any one article from its place. I have a system in everything, and order is one of my most prominent organs." "Eh? I don't see the organ, sir." "I do not mean a musical mammoth, Peter; however, let us proceed. You must talk but little; I dislike tattling. You may think as much as you please, but not aloud. 'A still tongue denotes a wise head.' " "Why, that's just what Poor Richard says." "Yes, Poor Richard does say something of that sort. Again, Peter, you must never divulge your-masters secrets. In all things be -discreet; and, above all, never engage in a political argument with any one, in the house or out of the house, if you can avoid it. I do not wish to restrain you in the expression,of manly sentiments, but I mean, do not provoke an argument from any one. , Again, it is necessary for you to know that myself and household are strictly watched by those who now hold the reins of power. You will, therefore, be discreet, observant, and even cautious." "Why, master, that is what Poor Richard says, in his advice 'to ser- vants." "Peter, you will oblige me by not quoting or alluding to Poor Rich- ard, in this house." "s Why, he Is a philosopher, they say, and we should remember his words. Yet he is an old miserly fellow, after all." s"Ha! a miser? Explain, Peter." "Why, don't he say 'a penny saved is a penny made,' then 'a penny a day is a pound a year,' and such like things? My, but he must be rich!" "Well, Peter, it may be you are right. I see you have studied him much, and you may have a chance of studying him still more, if you conduct yourself properly. Now go and change your clothes. See my housekeeper, and learn from her some of your household duties, what- ever they may be." "Sir, cannot I go first and see my sister, and tell her about my new place?" "Your sister?"   "Yes, sir; a little thing I brought down with me. Not so little, either; she sometimes thinks she is a young woman."  "Where is she now.'" "With Colonel Clayton, whose daughter she is going to serve. "Ah! a well-known adherent to the crown. The daughter, I am told, is somewhat patriotically inclined. Well, Peter, you can go, and after seeing your sister, and making arrangements to see and watch over her, you will return " "Thank you, sir," was all Peter coiuld say, for he was out of the door, and down the steps into the street, going at such speed that the philo- sopher began to calculate the distance he could run at the rate he was going, 'without- endangering life and limb; As he looked from the win- dow and watched Peter until he turned the -corner of: the street, he ex- claimed- 2   26     THE TINKER SPY. ( There goes a child of nature, honest and true. Your good men are those who mingle not with the vices of the town. Show me a man educated in the country, brought up amidst its towering hills and deep valleys, and I will show you a true man; ay, one who can emphatically be called one of nature's noblemen. Well, now tobusiness. Who's there" -- This question was addressed to some one who gave three taps at the door. "Walk in. Ah! Sherman, is that you? The very man I most wished to see. You look pale; sit down. Why, you are ill." Indeed, the appearance of the man whom he called Sherman, and whom our readers will recognize as Roger Sherman, called by the Brit- ish- the "cobbler politician," was such as might well excite the sympa- thies of his philosophical friend. Having placed a chair for his guest, Franklin drew up another beside him, and inquired, with much apparent sincerity, about his health, and the cause of his agitation. After a short delay, Sherman thus addressed Franklin: "The storm is up. I foretold it. Lord Grenville's theory of taxation is being carried out. The miserable cloak of the repeal of the Stamp Act, pleasing as it was to the people, is now thrown off. The storm was lulled only to gather strength, and then pour its wrath upon our devoted heads. What think you of this, Franklin 2 " "Why, I think very little of the repeal or its consequences, but I feel more anxious about you, my friend, whose iron nerves have heretofore acted as conductors to carry off the electricity of my nervous system." "Nay, my friend, this is no time for philosophy." "What, notime for philosophy? Sherman, the news you bring in such haste is already known to me. The new tax on tea, glass, oil and paint, -will never be paid by us. Nay, start not; the time has arrived for us to act. Have you seen Adams?" ' "I have, and he agrees with me: the word rebellion, or the declara- tion of our rights-liberty, or de/ath." "Sherman, your hand. Men say you never made a mistake in the- estimate' of what makes up the sum of man's happiness, and I believe it Look here; in this paper I have attempted to enumerate some of our grievances. We meet to-night, at the Wigwam in Fifth street, to consult upon the subject. The people are worn out, hopeless, helpless; the mother clings to the husband in despair, while the pale cheeks of their children tell a tale of approaching starvation. Again, the brutal soldiery insult our wives and daughters, and deem it no crime to mock their virtues. All, these things, Sherman, rise up like spectres, and tell us, in the language of despair, that we have noc country, no home, no protectors. Can we, as men, hear them say this?" "No, by heaven! No!" "Then meet us to-night. Jefferson, Adams, yourself, and a few more noble souls, will be present, and it will go hard if some demonstration be not made to show the feelings of the people. Hark! 'what noise is that  Look from the window, Sherman, while I replace this paper. What is the cause of this outhreak, eh . " "The soldiery are dragging a man'through the street, and the popu- lace oppose them. See! they obstruct the passage way, and seize pav- ing stones. This must not be." l %   THE TINKE   SPY.         2 "No!" exclaimed Franklin, as he gathered up some papers and thrust them into his pocket. "Let us go out and speak to them. The blow must not Be struck here yet. Hark! the noise increases." The two statesmen left the room, for the purpose of exercising their influence over the rioters, to preserve the peace. Peter, who had just returned from his short though pleasing visit to his sister, now entered the room. He had met his master and Mr. Sher- man on the stairs, and was told by the former to remain in the house until he returned. Peter, who had witnessed some portion of the strug- gle in the street, seemed anxious to talk about it; but, finding no person to converse with, he commenced a series of ejaculations, which came up from his throat in sudden jerks. "Bless my soul!" he exclaimed, "what a place this is!-and what a Tinker that is! Our Tinker-Sissy's Tinker-evierybody's Tinker, I be- lieve.  He knocked down a soldier, kicked a constable, and tore up a piece of old colored rag that they called a flag. If he be a real tinker, he is a brave one at any rate; but I doubt if he is one. "I will go to the window and see how things go on. There is Me. Sherman and my master. The Tinker has just finished making a speech; an officer approaches him; the Tinker steps back; he raises his arm; Sherman speaks to the officer; the crowd gather round; now Franklin speaks; they take. off their hats; the soldiers lower their guns; the peo- ple hurra; ah! two men seize -the Tinker while Franklin is speaking; down goes one of them; heels over head the other; away goes the Tinker; away go the crowd.  Franklin stops the soldiers. Well, they are gone, and the Tinker, I expect, has escaped. Now I must arrange these papers." He approached the table, where papers, books, and charts lay scat- tered in confusion. "What's this? 'The Stamp Act.'  'Tax on Tea.' 'Oppression of the Colonies.' 'Electricity.' 'Power of Attraction.' "ightning.  These papers I'll put here; gunpowder, tea, electricity, and taxes, are well suited. 'Tom Piune's Crisis.' Cry sis; my poor little Sis will cry if I don't see her often. So Paine has a sister too. 'The Right of Power: A    Pamphlet. B. F.  1775.' What is that about, I wonder?  England and France.  What's this? 'The Decla. ration of-of--what?-Independence.   Bless my heart, but this -is treason 'The King and Parliament-wrongs and oppressions-ropes and ladders.' This is high treason. Good gracious! I tremble all over. These papers were never left thus exposed except in mistake. Although every word here is death to the writer, I am not the boy to betray a secret thus obtained.  I know, from whispers, that we are' on the eve of a  mighty revolution; and in this little paper, I hold the very elements to raise one. I will keep it until I see my master. He don't know nae yet; when he does, he will find that I am one to obey him to death." '   8 THE TINKER SPY CHAPTER IV. ---"Her young heart, 1 '    Like Memnon's harp, beneath his eyes alone Gave out its hidden music. We now convey our readers to the splendid mansion of Colonel Clayton, whose name has already been mentioned.- It was in a room furnished in a style of elegance which would have shamed a nabob, that the scene we are now about to describe, occurred. The Colonel stood in the center of the room, gazing somewhat proudly on a young and beauteous girl, who sat tuning a guitar. She was a most lovely creature, scarcely eighteen years of age; her figure was large and admirably formed, while her countenance, beaming with health and beauty, told a tale of love hidden deep in the heart. Hers was indeed a loving -one, and as yet had never known the bitterness of ill-requited love, but her young dream was about being overclouded; the shade of 'parental power was uprising to cast a sombre hue over all that was bright and sunny in her bosom. The interview between the father and daughter will- explain: "Laura, my dear, now listen to me; put away that instrument-I have something of importance to say to you." "Wsait a moment, father, till I have tuned my guitar, and then I can practice this sweet air, while you are talking., ' Oh, bloom for me, sweet roses." "Make haste, my child, I am waiting." "One moment, father, while I shorten this band-there, now it fits." "Well, now what is it? Be quick, father, for I have many visits to return this morning." "My child, the subject upon"- "Hope told a flattering tale." "Laura, listen to me, I command you-the subject is of importance.' "I beg ten thousand pardons, dear father; pray, what were you talking about."? "This- letter has just arrived." Laura started, and gazing upon the seal, exclaimed: 'sAh! father, where is lie now?" "In Paris; on his way to claimn his betrothed.";' "Father, I cannot mEirry Lord Gilbert." "Not marry Lord Gilbert:! the'son of 'my old friend, and companioh of my early youth.? Pray; what has given rise to this new caprice." "I have, father, a thousand reasons." "How comes it then, that, until this moment, I never heard of, one of them . " "It was not until very recently that I thought seriously of it. Lord Gilbert may be abominably ugly, and as proud as-as-Lucifer." "On the contrary, child, he is deemed a very handsome man; and as to pride, his willingness to take the daughter of a simple Colbnel, is   THE TINKER SPY.            29 sufficient proof against that. Nay, start not, nor look so proudly, child; I tell you, that this same English lord might have his choice among the fairest and the noblest in the land; and an humble maiden, like your- self, Laura, should deem it high honor when he casts his thoughts so much beneath his level." "Then let him raise them up again. Laura Clayton values the humblest farmer in the colonies as high as she does any lord in Eng- land, and though she has left her own native land, to dwell among strangers, it was to please her father, not to wed the son of his old friend, who, by circumstances, becomes, forsooth,-a lord. Nor will Laura Clayton, Colonel's daughter though she be, submit to be bartered off unseen, and certainly unloved, like an article of merchandise." "Tragically spoken, Laura; but this is folly." "Yes! what is it but folly, when a father tells his child-for conceal it as you will, father, I know that the coronet which is to grace my brow is to be purchased by a dowry such as no English noble can count down to his titled daughter." "You have nothing to do with that, child." "Have I not?" "And if you had, your simple refusal is no reasonable argument!" "But, dear father," said Laura, gently, "I have a reason; I cannot wed Lord Gilbert, because I intend to marry somebody else." "May I be permitted -o ask what high personage has been selected for my son-in-law?" "Certainly, father, for the man Laura Clayton has selected. for her husband is one of whom she is not ashamed. It is-Sanford," "My secretary!-a wandering beggar, whom I took in when all the world had deserted him, and who even now has the audacity to uphold the principles of those rebels who are now attempting to uproot monarchy. If I thought that this was not badinage-mere idle talk to vex your fond father--I would turn you into the street this instant." "Father!" "Away! out of my sight! lest I forget myself, and say or do that, for which, hereafter, I might be sorry; away, I say!" "Father!" "Away, I say!" "Dear father, let me kiss you before I go." "There--now leave me." Laura gave one look towards her stemr parent, then with a hurried manner left the apartment. For a moment after her departure, the Colonel remained perfectly motionless. Recovering, however, he muttered to himself: "Umph! This must be looked to; Lord Gilbert on his return home -the time arranged-and this unfortunate attachment. Pooh! it canrot be. Fool that I was, to allow my feelings to get the better of my reason -and this strange youth. I must lobk to this. Yet, it cannot be, for when I told him of my daughter's marriage with Lord Gilbert, he manifested no surprise! It is strange-most strange!" ?   SO           THE TINKER SPY. CHAPTER V. * The Bay trees'in our country are wither'd,    * And meteors fight the fix'd stars of heaven:   ' The pale faced moon looks bloody on the earth, And lean look'd prophets whisper fearful change: Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap." The streets of Philadelphia, in the year 1775, presented a very different appearance from what they do now. Nor was it alone in the architectural design of the buildings, that so marked a difference existed. Other and momentous events than those that now occur, were transpiring, and the spirit of the revolution was abroad in the land. At the 'corners of the streets, small patches of men were seen discussing the subject of taxation, and the conduct of the British troops stationed in their midst" Again, apprentice boys had formed themselves into bands, and not unfrequently came in contact with the soldiery, the result of which was rather more favorable to the youthful colonists than the red- coats were willing to allow. These strifes, however, were not of an alarming character, as the commander had given strict orders not to fire, unless they assumed a treasonable shape, and then they were imperative. Philadelphia was, at that period, the Metropolis, and a great com- mercial city-; and although regarded as a Quaker one, and under the influence of that puritanical body, yet there was an under-current of patriotism and opposition to tyranny, running beneath its "drab-like appearance," like the fires of a -volcano. There were men in it who had been instrumental in getting up the opposition which eventually led to the resisting of the Port Bill, in Boston, in 1774. The men who entered into a concerted scheme to produce a great political change, were the Hon. Charles Thomson,- John Dickinson, author of "Farmer's Letters," Governor J. Reed, -General Thomas Mifflin and Benjamin Franklin. With such men, holding, as they did, public meetings at the "Old Coffee House," in Front street, below Black Horse alley, at the head of -the rebellious party, the apprentices felt themselves perfectly safe in the manifestation of their patriotic feeling. Col. Thomas Forrest formed a company in this year, (1 775,) whose members were all dressed in the style of Indians, with painted faces, leggings and plumes. At the same time, Capt. Copperthwaite formed a company of young Quakers, called the "Quaker Blues." Capt. John Cadwallader (afterwards General formed a company of "Greens," called, in allusion to the gentility of the members, "The Silk Stocking Company." They were afterwards General Washington's guards in New York. Such was the state of things, when, on the afternoon of the seven- teenth September, 1775, the neighborhood of Second and Market streets was thrown into a complete state of excitement, by the sudden   THE TINKER SPY. organization of a body of men, who seemed bent on some bold and sudden ovement   A guard of soldiers, consisting of an officer and uddr men, imm  ediately vac the ground, and were seen marching, fwithrapid speed, toward tie British barracks, at that time situated at the corner of Second and Tammany streets. The  Crowd increased; indeed, it seemed as if the meeting had been announced, for a number of persons carried banners, upon which were printed, in artistical letter:-- "No Taxation," "Down with Foeign Troops," "Our Own Laws,   " "Down with Monarchy,:' "Liberty or Death," "Concord    Lexington," 4".Ben Franklin,'" "Tom Paine," ,Roger Sherman," &c., &c  . These and various other well-known names, were, as we have stated, enrolled on the banners; and as they marched up in a body, loud shouts rent the air.  When they had arranged themselves in some sort of order, a man stepped forth, and on reaching a temporary platform, was g reeted by loud exclamations. It was the Tinker. His whole appearance was somewhat changed; he was now dressed more, like a mechanic, yet his bearing, manner, and command of words, made even this appear an- assumed garb, adopted for the time, and occasion. The moment silence was obtained, he thus addressed the crowd: Fellow.- Citizens:--We are surrounded by British troops--they encompass us even now; and, as I speak, large bodies are moving down from the barracks, for the purpose of dispersing us at the end of theayonet  This little spot, fellow-citizens, may be hallowed with our blood, and, like the plains of Concord and Hexington, send forth dying notes of vengeance. Fellow-colonists, we have met here for no hostile purpose; our object is merely the right of petition." Here, a voice in the crowd shouted out: "No more petitions--there is no faith in kings.". ,'Treason!" shouted another. "Down with the Spy!" was uttered by numerous voices. "Silence, fellow-citizens. Let us organize the meeting, and pass a series of resolutions. I move that Thomas Paine take the chair." A voice from the crowd: "He is not present. But here comes Henry Sanford; huzza for Sanford." The individual who now presented himself, was a young man of most prepossessing appearance; his' age could not have exceeded that of twenty-two his bearing was bold and manly, blended with an air of modesty and truth which softened the characteristics of the two former. As he approached the crowd, he cast his eyes rapidly around, and springing upon a sort of platform, and bowing gracefully to the excited mob, for in reality it was one, he thus very rapidly addressed the asse- blage of individuals composiqg it: , Fellow- Citizens:--The voice of the prophet has spoken; the axe has been applied to the root of oppression, and the tree totters to its fall. You have heard, no doubt, that I have been dismissed the Secretary- ship of the Commandant of his Majesty's services. Colonel Clayton's conduct to the colonists, and his abuse of the power invested in-him, compelled me to resist his commands, hence my dismissal-a dismissal   32     .THE TINKER SPY. I sought, and have now obtained. Now, fellow-citizens, I can meet you in the open street, and-express my sentiments freely. You areI aware that the avowed purpose of the British troops amongst us, is to kill and destroy. The words of Tom Paine are that, 'if they succeed in placing the military above the civil power, we shall all be hanged like dogs."' Loud shouts of "down with them--down with them," now interrupted the speaker:- After silence was obtained, Sanford offered to the consid- eration of the meeting, the following resolution: "Resolved, That in consequence of the- differences which have long subsisted with Great Britain, and have been greatly increased by divers late acts, it is absolutely necessary to hold a Congress of Deputies from all the colonies; and that a committee be appointed to open a commu- nication and correspondence to effect the object. And firther-" At that. moment the sound of a drum, and the heavy tread of sol- diers, caused the speaker to stop. All eyes were turned in the direction of the sound. The whole scene was instantly -changed, by the appear- ance of a company of soldiers, led by a most determined opponent of the rights of the colonists. Commanding a halt, he approached the erowd, and in a loud authoritative voice,-commanded them to disperse. The Tinker, who during all this time had remained somewhat in the background, now stepped forth, .and asked in a deep and manly voice: "Why disperse? We have met here to discuss a question of right" "I tell you again, to disperse." "We will not disperse. The right of public meeting is granted to us ;by -the Constitution." "The constitution of rebels.'-' "The constitution of the Continental Congress, sir!" g It does not give you the privilege of uttering treason, and inflaming the minds of the people." "Treason! Corporal!-who has uttered treason?" "Every one of you; and there is not a man within tie sound of my voce whose neck is not in danger." At these words a portion of the crowd began to move away. "Cowards!" exclaimed the Tinker; "will you be scared by the idle words of this man 8 Stand up to your rights." "Again-will you disperse ." "We will not/ Go on, Sanford, with the business of the meeting." "If you insist upon doing so, I shall instruct my men to fire. Re- member Concord!" Sanford, who had during all this time remained- on the stand, now shouted out: t 'Yes, fellow-citizens, remember Concord and Lexington. Remember all the abuses, wrongs and oppressions heaped upon you; remember that you are men, and as men answer--are you in favor of the resolu- tion I have just read to you?" A universal--"Aye, aye," was the response. The Corporal immediately ordered his men to approach, and com- manded them to secure the Tinker and Sanford, as " treasonable rioters," observing, that if they offered the least resistance to ,fire upon them. Ar sene of bloody strife was most likely to ensue, for the people were AL    THE TINKER SPY.            33 preparing to contend with the soldiery, when an unexpected personage quietly stepped upon the scene of action. / This individual was BENJA- MIN FRANKLIN. "Hold!" he exclaimed-"Stand back, sir-would you imitate the conduct of your brethren at Concord? would you adopt Lord North's pacific plan of cutting the people's throats, and reason 1with their lifeless forms afterwards? That most christian statesman stated also, that, he would carry the sword in one hand, and the olive branch in the other; but it seems you would give a taste of the sword first." The Corporal, during this speech, had motioned his men back. Ad- dressing Franklin, he asked the question in a somewhat more respectful manner than that which he had addressed to the others-, If he coupled himself with these riotous men?" "I do sir," was the emphatic reply. "What is it they ask Is it not justice, equity and right? Have they not tamelyosubmitted to every insult that it is possible for a great power to heap upon the unprotMoted? And now that they have assembled here, in their civil right as citizens, for the purpose of examining into the causes which compel them to op- pose these frequent insults, you accuse them of treason. Is it treason to think, to speak and act as men? Is it treason to stand thus forth in the open street, and declre as I do, their detestation of oppression? They have been provoked to action;- and the people of this country are too wise to move in any cause, without due reflection. They have most' valiantly conspired against tyrants, and disdain to wear the chains your most pious kingy would hang around them. Of the character of your Parliament I can speak, from the fact of my being examined there on matters appertaining to these very disturbances. Would you, I repeat, imitate the conduct of the soldiery at Concord, and shoot down our cit- izens in the public streets? Would you do -this a And if you did, is it by the order of that butcher, that bully whose hireling cut-throats exercised their murderous weapons upon unarmed men? Would you do this? No! Nor will you dare attempt it. Be advised-disperse. And you, Mr. Sanford, holding as you do an office under, government, and your commandant, Colonel Clayton, an officer under his Majesty, I am surprised to see you a-leader here." "I am no longer in his service, sir." "It is well; be advised, and disperse. You have passed your resolu- tion, publish it to the world through the columns of the Penasylva- nia lwonzicle; let the nation know your sentiments, and if the king will not right you, there is a power, more potent, that will-TEiE PzOPLE." Loud shouts followed this address, and the Corporal, finding the meet- ing ended, marched off with his men. After the departure of the soldiers, several of the leading men of the party composing the meeting gathered round Franklin, among whom was the Tinker. Watching an opportunity, he approached so near the philosopher and sage that he could whisper in his ear a word which startled Franklin. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "and who are you! The password, sir 2                 * "Concord," was the whispered response. "'Have you a message from--"   34       '   THE TINKER SPY. "General'Washington-I have." "Hush!-give it me. Call at my house, we must confer together." "'I will," was the reply. "Now that is off my mind-I have other work. Ha! by heavens, here comes Colonel Clayton-and a guard; the mischief' is not over yet." Colonel Clayton, with all that pomposity which high position and wealth gives, now approached the spot where Franklin was still conversing with his friends. "Well met, Mister Franklin; my officer has given me a sad account of this day's work." "No doubt, sir. Your officer, as well as others in your employ, give some very strange accounts of how things are going on here. They stated at one time that I was in favor of the Stamp Act. That was correct,- but unfortunately they misapplied the word in its application, for I was in favor of stamping it under foot." "These are words, Mister Franklin, which, if uttered elsewhere, might lead to serious consequences." "They have been uttered elsewhere. They were uttered in your own Parliament House, reiterated here in the public streets of Philadel- phia-and, sir, we have music as an accompaniment; That music is played to the tune of more tax, more ball, more powder, and in the dis- tances are heard the groans and cries of the wounded, who were left bleeding on the field at Lexington, and in the streets at Concord." Here there was a loud shout from the crowd. "Will you endeavor, Mr. Franklin, to silence these noisy people, and use your endeavors hereafter to check these outhreaks?"In the deliv- ery of this speech Colonel Clayton changed much of the sarcastic manner which characterized his address to Franklin previously. The word Mister, which he first applied to that gentleman in a tone of voice which amounted to a sneer, was now softened down to a more familiar, or at least more respectful style. Franklin, who had remarked this alteration in the Colonel's tone, also changed his, and in a mild manner replied:- - "Yes, readily; but first remove the troops; their appearance here, with you at their head, is not calculated to soothe men who have met with nothing but insult ever since they were quartered upon them." "This is-an impossibility." "s it; then here ends our conference." "I will, however, for your sake withdraw my men a short distance, and if this scene is renewed, I shall know how to act." "Then, Colonel Clayton, let me tell you, that if it is your intention to watch the motions of the people of these colonies, with a band of hired soldiers at your back, from this moment we are no lon'ger friends." "Then sir, we part as enemies." "I am sorry to say we do. You belong to that party which has doomed my country to destruction; you have already begun-to burn our towns, and murder our people. Look upon your hands! ay, they are red with the blood of your relations. We have been friends-yoir are now my enemy. Look to it, sir-I say you are now mine enemy."

The events of the period to which our story refers followed each other in such rapid succession that it is almost impossible to link theta together in such a manner as to render them, unless we wrote in the historic style, statistically correct, without being-iccused with anachronisms We there- fore pass over a few days subsequent to the scenes which occurred in the last chapter, and introduce our readers once more into the dwelling of Colonel Clayton. Laura, his beaute ous daughter, was seated on a beautiful ottoman, but not alone. Beside her sat a young man, in whom our readers will recognise her father's late secretary, Sanford. The lovers, for such in- deed they were, seemed much agitated, and up to the period of which we now speak, they had been engaged in earnest, and no doubt, to them at least, very interesting conversation , "DeareSt!Laura," excltaimed Sanford, "I must tear myself away, for the storm is up, and-the flag of defiance to the king will shortly be un furled from the highest steeple in our city. My position is a dangerous one- dangerous from the fact that in your father I have a foe, whose power and inuenc, added t his;knowledgoe of our loves, can at any moment have me seized and imprisoned." "True, dear Sanford, my father's stern opposition to the republican party , and strong adherence to monarchy, places an inseparable barrier, as it were, between us; but, Sanford, that barrier will be removedwhen the colonists are free, and until then rely on the love of your own Laura. "Then   let the storm rage oi. Your father cannot but respect me. He will not, when the banner of freedom waves o'ertlhe land, oppose thosewho planted it there; for all who are notwith us then are against us--foes, deadly, deadly only to themselves.   "Ah, Sanford, you do not know my father. Sooner would he see me dead than wedded to one he not onsince branded in my presence  as a rebel. And then you know that hatefulm "age in which his soul  is so enwrapt.   "Laura, listen. To-night will decide the destiny of this country. To-.  night a few of the sages of these colonies meet in the old Wigwam,    :! South Fifth street; I dare not say for what, as there is connected with , .i that meeting a solemn secret, to which men are bound by oaths as sa-  cred as amen can take, not to divulge. And while that secret meeting Ia plans the future destiny of our country, a band of brave and desperate mren meet on the banks of the Wissahickon within the walls of the old  Monastery."  "It is indeed a wild spot, where the sun's rays seldom penetrate, and  where giant oaks spread their huge limbs o'er rock andglen, as the out-  " works to defend its secret avenues from the unhallowed tread of the    : s tr a n g e r . " ^ - it is there we meet to-night, and as life and death are in the pur- poses of that assemblage, none but the initiated are invited. Te pass- word-I will whisper it to you, Laura, for the time may come when you may be called upon to use it for safety and protection-it is, INDEP ND- :NCE!" You can trust me, Sanford, for I would risk even life itself to ad- vance that cause which has for its object the emancipation of a nation from the bondage which tyranny inflicts upon it; but oh, Sanford, what :..of trouble, and.-I shudder while I say it-perhaps of blood, seems rubng up before us. When will it cease to ebb and flow  ot until these- colonies n prolaim o all-freedom to the slave. Not until we can stand erect, and gaze upon the bright sun and the glad avens,. and shout in the fullness of our hearts--liberty and Independ- nee. Then,- and not till then, will the sea of troubles you speak of cease low.' Then will this beauteous land bloomin all its full and natural 'eory-then-will the mountain top and deep glen echo the glad tidings 'er the land." "Yes, Sanford, it will be consummated. Methinks I can see in the uw dim prospective, rising up like spectral forms from the shadowy scene  efore, a youthful nation, with its temples and its palaces, its towns and cities. I can see the huts of the oppressed crushed before the pro- esie march ofciviliation. I can hear the shouts of nation of f Ople, and imagination robes the whole scene with a light which glares sars hey stre dayn frof    . . d sparkles like the rays of the sun in its happiest flood of heavenly owers, as they stream down from the throne of their Creator." "Glorious! lIt me imprint on that cheek a brother's kiss-there, that  aI shall only be replaced by the lips of a nearer and dearer one-that a husband Now, Laura, I  must bid you farewell; your father must tFed mwe here; hut stay, before I go-ndeed I had almost forgotten ia this- moment of joyous- rapture--I m ust speak of one now in our dst, who has a powerful infltuence over the people."

Over me he exercises an influence I cannot account for; he is even authoritative in his commands, but so full of love and kindness that I obey him. He is a man deeply versed in this world's affairs, and is not what he seems." "I shall obey you, dear Sanford, in all things." "Farewell, Laura, may heaven watch over you." And thus the lovers parted. For a moment, like Niobe, all in tears, the maiden stood gazing after her lover, and as she saw him bound over the fence, and seek the shelter of the deep shrubbery, to avoid the pry- ing eyes of the household, her heart sank within her, and she fell sob- bing on the ottoman. Ten minutes had scarcely elapsed since the departure of Sanford, and ere Laura had sufficiently recovered from the agitation the interviews with her lover had caused her, her servant maid, Jane, with whom our readers are already acquainted, rushed into the room exclaiming,--"He is taken, he is taken!" and she sobbed as if her own life was in as much peril as was evidently the object of her fears. Miss Clayton, whose mind was all absorbed with one individual; im- mediately conjectured that Sanford was in some measure connected with the affair.  "Speak, Jane, is he --who is taken?" were the half screamed words she addressed to the equally excited maiden. "The Tinker, Miss, that brave man who protected Peter and me froxa the rude soldiers." 'A prisoner. Where-how?" "In this very house, Miss. It seems that a fight took place in the market house, between the people and the guard, and the Tinker knocked the corporal down. He was overpowered, Miss, and dragged here by your cruel father." "Where is he?" ",In the block house, at the end of the long corridor." "This man, whom you call the Tinker, is the friend of Sanford." "Yes, Miss, as he is the friend of everybody-" "Silence, Jane, here comes my fatrher; leave the room." "Yes, Miss. ,0, how fierce he looks." The-interview which took placejbetween parent and child is not of suf;- ficient interest to be given here, the consequence of which, however, will- be attended to hereafter. CHAPTER    VII. During which time of imprisonment there, I found amongst those, my prison, fellows and keepers, some that had known ;ne before.- HAoKLUVT'a VOYAGES. In our last chapter, mention was made of the Tinker being placed in a block house. The name isnow, at least as applied to buildings, nearly obsolete. In the old records of annals of our city, frequent mention   f  3 8         THE TINKER SPY. is made of them. The fact of their being used-as places of defence, in the early stage of our colonial history, is one reason why they are so frequently mentioned. The old Swedes"Church was used as a block house, and it was provided with loop holes, still visible, for the purpose of firing from, and for defence. They were also used for the court to set in. We have an old record, which we give: "Captain Hans Inrgrx is ordered to warn the men belonging to his company, and with them to fit up and finish the house of defence at Upland, Chester county, for the Court-to set in." It seems that block houses were built in various por- tions of the city and surrounding country, and that they derive this name from the fact of being built chiefly of blocks of wood. During the progress of our Revolution, they were used as guard houses, and the commanding -officers not unfrequently held what are now termed courts martial, in a room appropriated in such buildings for that purpose. To one of these strongholds we now convey our readers. As stated, it was in part on the premises of Colonel Clayton, and under these cir- cumstances, he could exercise an authority in which revenge and a spirit of cruelty, as well as personal feeling, could put at defiance the more equitable laws, which, in those rude times, were scarcely ever resorted to, more particularly if the supposed criminal favored the cause of the rebels. On a rude bench, his arms tied securely behind his back, sat the Tin- ker, in whose fate our readers, we feel assured, take some interest. If sany one could have seen his countenance, and watched it with an eye to detect fear or doubt as regarded his fate, he could not have discovered, by the slightest movement of a single muscle, any indications of that effect. What his reflections were,may be gathered from his own words. "Well, they have me again in their clutches, but these prison walls are not strong enough to hold me; but I will not attempt to escape un- til I am placed onc* more face to face with my keeper. Ha! ha! my keeper. Well, the only thing I regret is, that I can't meet the boys at the Wissahickon to-night No matter; there will be those there who will perform my part. Hark! Ah, here comes Jane. Well, my prim- rose, do you come to cheer me with hope, or alarm me with despair?" "Oh! Mr. Tinker,. don't talk that way. I bring your dinner." "Supper, rather; eh, Jane?" "Both, sir. But, oh! what a miserable place this is; and your hands tied, too!" "True, Jane; and as I have not the use of them, why, you will have to feed me." "I won't stand by and see a human creature treated so; I will un- loose the ropes, though I die for it." So saying, Jane immediately ap- plied herself to the task, and in a few moments his arms were free. "Thanks, Jane, thanks. Now, while I discuss your humble meal, sit you down and let us have a little chat. In the first place, call me Col- lins; not that I dislike your appellation of 'Mr. Tinker,' for that is my business; but, as we are to be good friends, I would have you call me by a more familiar name-Oollins." "Well, Mr. Collins, there is your supper." "Good; these cakes are excellent. Ah, Jane, but you are a kind creature."   THE TINKER SPY            39 4( Thanks, sir." !"And, Jane, these pickles-how sour they are; but you look 8t sweet." "Mr. Collins!" "' Miss Jane--:now listen: I love you, Jane; nay, start not-I speak the truth; I loved you from the first moment I saw you. Love, Jane, is a curious thing; it springs up in the heart like a flower in its consum- mate growth. There are flowerets of the heart as well as of the gar- den, and those that have their origin in love are the sweetest to sense and feeling." "And this is love?" "It is." "I never felt it, then-for my heart is not like a garden, for I think more of the flowers that grow in the fields and bloom in the valleys, than I do of those of love's growth. Indeed, I do not know what they are, unless they are the feelings I have for my brother, and Miss Clay- ton, and-and"- "Well, go on; say for me. Nay, blush not. Now listen, Jane: if you have no objection to a plain, blunt man-one that has never yet deceived, knowingly, man or woman-I would have you think of me as one that will ever love, protect, and cherish you." "Oh! sir"- " Nay, listen. I am not exactly what I seem. The life of a tinker pleases me; that is not, however, my calling. I am not poor, neither am I rich; but I have a true heart, and I would bestow it on one who has its counterpart." "Mr. Collins, I am a poor, simple country girl, born and educated as it were amid yonder blue mountains. My father was my teacher, for my poor mother died when I was quite young; yet this I can say; there is my hand-and I will own it, that when you so nobly defended my brother and myself, I thought that you seemed then as near and as dear to me as my brother." I "I have much to say to you, Jane-but I hear the opening of the outer door; we will meet again. By heavens! it is the Colonel. Sooner than I expected." Jane started up, and, gathering together the remains of the prisoner's repast, she stepped aside to admit the dreaded commandant, and then hurried away, her young heart beating between two extremes-those of hope and fear. "So, sir," exclaimed the Colonel, addressing the prisoner, "I have you in my power at last." "Yes--we meet again." "Meetagain? Villain, what do you meant I never saw you until this day, although I have heard of you, and my spies have been on your track for weeks." "Indeed? Your memory is failing, Mr. Clayton." "I am a Colonel in the army of his majesty, sir." "Ay, so you are; still I assert, your memory is failing." "What do you mean, sirrah?" '! mean that, in order that our conversation may be more familiar,   40           THE TINKER SPY. and the subject matter properly discussed, we should at least know some- thing of each other." .             I "You, sir, are a spy, and as such, shall be immediately tried, and an example made, so as to deter others from imitating your villainous con- duct." "Good; and will you adopt the old plan of the rack, which you so successfully practised at Rouen?" "Ah! But this knowledge, vile wretch, will avail you but little here. Know that I have the means at hand to subdue your haughty spirit.", "No doubt-for the thumb screws were a favorite amusement of yours at Rouen." "Well, sir, your allusion to Rouen affects me not, as no doubt you were one of the many criminals whose misdeeds brought them before the tribunal of which I'was"-- "Chief inquisitor; I know. Well 8" 6"And there you suffered the torture. Is this your history?" "No, not exactly. Do you see this little roll of paper, Colonel Clay. ton.' If you do see it, I would advise you-to become better acquainted with its contents, before you make my acts known before the' military court." "Papers? What do you mean? Let me see them." "Look; do you see this dates?" 1743, '47, '68, '69. Then observe -' Secret Tribunal at Rouen-a leaf from page 7762.' " "This is some scheme, villain. You wish to purchase your life with these papers. They are valueless." "Are they?"  "Certainly; or else"-- "I have forged them, you would say. Well, even the mere fact of there :being, original ones in existence, does not lessen the authenticity of these. But they are not forged." "Who are you? Speak, and end this mummery." "Look at me; aye, get in the shade, and let the rays of yon setting sun fall directly upon my face. Do you recognize ie now? Ah! you start" "iI certainly have seen those features before; was it at Rouen " "It was at Rouen." "'You were Register to the Secret Tribunal in that city." !"True; -your memory is better - than I had imagined it to be. But is 'that all you remember, connected with my features?" "No; and that which I do recall is of such a character, that your hopes of release are now entirely cut off. I have charges against you of a more serious character than the mere identity of your person."  "Indeed!" "That you shall presently see, bold villain that you are. My time is too precious to waste with you; another tribunal will decide your fate." "Have you secret tribunals here, too? Nay, stop; it is not wise or prudent for you to leave me thus. One word: does the name of Jaques Chamberlain live in your memory? Ah! you start. Listen: you.,hated that man, because he wedded the woman you loved, and who despised that love, as she was a sensible woman, and could distinguish the dif- ference between a man of honor and a parvenu." c   THE TINKER SPY.            41 Scoundrel!"  "Well, let scqundrel be the word; parvenu is more refined, and does not apply so much to baseness in deeds, as it does to that of-birth. You must listen; go if you like, but I advise you to stop awhile. Your ha- tred to Chamberlain pursued him to death. You went before the Secret Tribunal, and swore that he was leagued with the foes of the govern- ment. He was brought to trial. Lies, and a well-concocted scheme gotten up by you, convicted him. You demanded his head, as an act of justice; you got it. The blood streamed from the block down to your very feet. You laughed, you shouted; so did the crowd; and his widow, my sister, died of a broken heart!" "Ha! your sister? ." "My sister. That man, Chamberlain, I loved like a brother, for never did a nobler heart beat in a human breast. Now, sirl; you have me; do you want my life?" "This is your version of the affair. Who do you think will believe a wandering tinker vagabond, even on his oath, when he dares to de- fame the name and character of a commander of his majesty's forces? Fool--idiotl-I laugh at your threats!" "Nay, stop a moment, Colonel. When I left the Register's office at Rouen, I carried away with me all the documents connected with that trial, containing all the evidences of your perjury and villainy on that occasion, and certain certificates, well authenticated, to show that malice alone, and not a desire to further the cause of justice, actuated you on to complete his ruin and death. Here they are." - o"Give those papers to me--useless as they are here-and you shall go free." "Never!" "Then will I wrest them from you, and you shall perish on the scaf- fold, as a detected spy." "Hold, Colonel. You say they are useless here; look at them first." "Ah! By heavens, these are damning proofs. How came you by these  Wretch, you robbed the bureau. Thus, thus I tear the records. Now, now, who dare breathe aught against the character of Clayt or ne /  I dare; I, the poor Tinker. Those scattered fragments are the mere copies of the originals. T hey, thank heaven, are beyond your reach." "Where--where are they?" "In the hands of my nephew, Chamberlain's son." "And he" "Was a few days since your secretary." "Ha! betrayed--and this is your revenge. My daughter to be the victim. Ah! I see it all. This to your heart!" The C(olonel, with a rapidity as startling as its consequences had like to have been fatal,rushed upon the Tinker with  a drawn dagger. The latter, however, by a quick movement caught the uplifted arm, and, by a sudden motion, hurled his opponent tothe ground. In the strug- gle, the dagger fell from the Colonel's hand; seeing this, the Tinker raised it as if to strike, when both were startled by a wild scream. In- stinctively they turned their eyes toward the door, on the threshold ofi which stood Laura. "Oh, spare my father!" were the words which 3   42           THE TINKER SPY. acted like magic on the Tinker. He started up, threw down the dagger. and, gazing for a moment on the prostrate Colonel, he uttered, in a deep, fearful tone-"Remember!" and, as he passed Laura, he stopped for a moment, took her hand, which was cold as ice, and whispered these words in her ear: "I did not intend him harm. For your sake and Sanford's, I spared his life. Farewell." So saying, he rushed out. CHAPTER VIII. See the Yankees leave the hill, With baggernets declining, With lopped down hats and rusty guns, And leather aprons shining. -BURLESQUE VERSES, BY GEN. BURGOYNE. We now convey our readers to the house of Franklin, in a room of which sat the philosopher, evidently laboring under some extraordinary excitement. Indeed, the crisis had arrived toward which so many pat- riotic gentlemen of the Revolution had looked forward with a feverish anxiety. The under-current was uprising, and an overflowk that was to sweep away oppression from the land, was hourly expected to take place. The tocsin had been sounded, and every man was now expected to stand boldly up and abide the issue. The following, which we find among our fragments of the Revolution, gives a tolerable good view of the state of affairs at that period, and will afford our readers an opportunity of re- alizing, in part, the cause of Franklin's anxiety, alluded to at the open- ing of this chapter: "While events were thus passing around New York, Congress, hav- ing assembled in Philadelphia, were -engaged in the momentous question of a Declaration of Independence. Many of the separate provinces had already acted on the subject. North Carolina took the first step, and took a vote instructing her delegates to concur with the other colonies in declaring independence. Massachusetts followed. Virginia next wheel- ed into the ranks; then Connecticut and New Hampshire. Maryland opposed it, while the delegates from the remaining provinces were in- structed to unite with the majority, or left free to act as their judgments might dictate. Thus instructed, the representatives of the people as- sembled in solemn conclave, and long and anxiously surveyed the per- ilous ground on which they were treading. To recede was now impos- sible; to go on seemed fraught with terrible consequences. The struggle had not been for independence, but for the security of rights, in which they had the sympathy and aid of some of the wisest statesmen of Eng- land. To declare themselves free, would cut them off from all this sympathy, and provoke at once the entire power of England against them. The result of the long and fearful conflict that must follow, was,   - -- THE TINKER SPY.         43 more than doubtful. For twenty days Congress was tossed on a sea of -perplexity. At length, Richard Henry Lee, shaking off the fetters that galled his noble spirit (June 7th), arose, and in a clear, deliberate tone, every accent of which rung to the farthest extremity of the silent hall, read, 'Resolved, That these United Colonies are, and ought to be, free and independent States, and all political connection between us and the State of Great Biritain is and ought to be totally dissolved.' John Adams, in whose soul glowed the burning future, seconded it in a speech so full of impassionale fervor, thrilling eloquence, and prophetic power, that Congress was carried away as by a resistless wave before it." At the precise moment we now introduce the reader into Franklin's library, he had just sealed a letter; taking up a pen he wrote the super- scription, and was in the act of penning the direction, when he hesitated. "Ah, let me see," he exclaimed, picking up a MS., "Cambridge-yes, that will reach him in time. Ah, Peter, I was just going to call for you; this letter-hark! what noise is that?"Peter, who had entered the room as stated, did not answer immediately. His looks were the mirror of inward troubles. "Speak, Peter, you seem alarmed." "I am alarmed, sir." "What noise is that in the street . " "The people are all mad, sir." "Well, Peter, it really does seem as if they were going wild. But take this letter to the post office immediately, it is of the utmost conse- quence." "Sir, I want to ask you a question." "Well, what is it?" d"I want to go home, sir." "Home-home, Peter--that name sounds discordant to my ears now. Home-we have no home, Peter; the torch and the rifle are destroying them, and it is to render our homes-if we dare call them so-safe, is one of the objects of that letter you hold in your hand." "Eh-what to ' General Washington,' this letter for him?" "Peter, I had hoped that you would have remained with me. You are true and faithful. We are all, I admit, in the midst of dangers; they surround us on all sides; nay, our very necks are in danger." "Oh! good gracious, I feel mine getting stiff already." "Peter, you are a good lad, but fear not; I am a member of the Con- tinental Congress, as well as the one which is just formed, and assem- bles here in this city, my person, and those of my household, are safe. This Congress is yet acknowledged under- the British laws; until it changes, which will not be long, you are safe." "I am no coward, Mr. Franklin. I will take up my musket and fight for my country-but these street fights; stones and clubs, fists and kicks, I do not like them; and then they have taken my friend prisoner." "Your friend? Of whom do you speak?" "Mr. Collins, the Tinker man." "Ah! a prisoner-and by whose authority?" "Col. Clayton's. I saw him dragged a prisoner to the block-house." "This must be looked to; that man is important to us and our cause." 1   "           THE TINKER SPY. "Oh, will you save him 8" '"Yes." "Then I will not go home; I will remain here, and die for you." "Not for me, Peter, but if needs must be, for your country. Now off to the post office." .                      I "I fly, sir." Now Peter only spoke figuratively, for his not having wings was one of the chief reasons why he did not fly; but if a sudden rush, and a jump of some fifteen feet, could by any casuistical reason- ing be construed into an aerial flight, he certainly made a good attempt to carry his new theory into practice. Franklin smiled as Peter made-his sudden exit, but soon his features assumed a stern and reflective expression. "Yes," he muttered, " the crisis approaches. Washington heads the troops in the west--men of. iron nerves and hearts of steel. It now indeed looks like a- rebellion. Ah, those shouts-something has occurred-more news." At that mo- ment a knock was given at the door---one single knock - evidently a signal one, for in a moment Franklin exclaimed-"'Tis Sherman." The door was opened, and Sherman, in company with Colonel Clayton, entered the room. A glance passed between Franklin and Sherman. The latter remarked, as he took a seat, that he met the Colonel nearly opposite the house, and they proposed to pay him a visit. "You are welcome, gentlemen, although the Colonel and myself can never agree on certain points -relative to this great controversy between the States and the Crown." "Nor are we likely, Mr. Franklin-; a vile spirit is abroad, and the very streets are the arena wherein it displays itself, to the terror of the well disposed." "That vile spirit was raised on your side of the house, not on ours." "No, sir; there is a hired scribbler among you, whose name is Thomas Paine; that man, sir, is the master spirit, who sways the rabble. Even now, as I passed along, this vile sheet was thrust into my hand. See, it. is called the 'Crisis,'--a more treasonable document I never read." "Paine certainly writes well, his arguments are strong, and I am not surprised that the sword, not the pen, is resorted to as an answer. I have heard, Colonel, of several arrests being made." "There have been several. Mr. Sherman is aware of the character of at least one of them." '"Yes," replied Sherman, "I know of one man whose arrest was a high handed measure, and I for one protest against it." You allude to a man who has assumed the tinker's calling." "I know him as a tinker, whether assumed or not I am not prepared to say." "He is not the only one whose name is marked. There are those who stand high in the social scale of life already watched." "Ah-please name them." 4I will. Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and some twenty others " "Thanks, Colonel; your mention of my name, and that of my friend Sherman, shows a desire on your part to give us what they call in Ire- land, 'Paddy's hint;'- but we will not take it."   THE TINKER SPY.            45 "Then, sirs, the bloody scenes that have already taken place, emanat- ing as they have froni your writings, and from those of others, be upon your heads." "Colonel, when we parted last I was in hopes that we should not have met again; but now that we lhave met, now that we stand before each other face to face, hear what I have to say. You infer that the bloody scenes which have already been enacted were in a measure sanctioned by us. Did we sanction the firing upon the people at Con- cord and Lexihgton? Have we given our sanction to the wrong and oppression heaped upgn us by your government? Our petitions have been disregarded, and all that was clearly right therein contained has been made to appear clearly wrong, and now, sir, you find fault because the people are disposed to resist tyranny, and maintain their rights like men." "I did not come here to be catechized," was the reply of the Colonel. Sherman, who had remained calm and neutral, now in a somewhat milder strain, addressing Franklin, observed--"Would it not be better, Mr. Franklin, to request the Colonel to restrain his men; they have be- come so insolent that patience ceases to be a Virtue on the part of the citizens. Indeed that was one of the motives I had in requesting the Colonel to call." " I certainly, Mr. Sherman, will do all I can; but Lord Howe's in- structions are to keep the people down, even at the point of the bayonet." Franklin started to his feet, evidently excited beyond his usual equa- nimity, exclaiming,--"Is it so? Then hear me. "If these are his orders, listen to the consequence. The soldiers at Crown Point, receiving no doubt similar orders, acted in accordance. Hav6 you heard the result 2 Listen," going to the table, he took up a letter; '"the people in the street," says my correspondent, " shout liberty or death, as they resist the troops. Shots are exchanged in all directions-" "Is this so?" exclaimed the Colonel, in evident astonishment. "Listen to the postscript. The soldiers have yielded, and Crown Point is now in the possession of the colonists." "Ah-and has it come to this!" "Listen further, Colonel," taking up another letter. "The people of Ticonderoga have chastised the insolence of the soldiers, who are now in the hands of the so-called rebels." "I must see to my despatches. Strange-- excuse me, gentlemen," as the Colonel was in the act of going, the door opened, and a gentleman entered, evidently in possession of some important information. "Ah, Dickson, is that you a " "I would have a few words with you, Mr. Franklin, if these gentle- men--" "Speak out, Dickson, we are all listeners here; our business now is to hear the news-out with it." "At Bunker Hill a great battle has been fought - the British have been driven back with the loss of over one thousand killed and wound- ed. But General Warren, who was among the last to contend in de- - fending a point, fell, and died on the field that immortalizes itself with his name."   "          THE TINKER SPY. "Peace to his ashes," was uttered by Franklin, and for a moment a solemn silence reigned in the room, although every bosom was swelling with deep emotions. The Colonel, in a somewhat milder tone, observed that, as the blow was struck, the prospect of a bloody war was before them. At that moment Colonel Clay was announced. He brought despatches for Colonel Clayton. "I was directed here, Colonel, and as theirscontents are important, I considered it my duty to waive all ceremony. Mr. Franklin, I am pleas- ed to see you. Mr. Sherman, good day." The Colonel, with much politeness, took his leave, while Colonel Clayton was poring over his despatches. "It seems, gentlemen, that the battle was fought on the 17th of June. My account, however, differs somewhat from that of yours. It is stated here, that the'Americans, as they are now termed, retreated; but our loss is great, while yours is no more than four hundred and fifty, killed and wounded. My presence is now required elsewhere; and in leaving you, gentlemen, let it be understood, that I do so with the highest respect for your opinions in relation to this great struggle, but cannot' reconcile them to my sense of that justice due to my king and country." So saying, the Colonel bowed'stately, and left the apartment. "Now, Sherman, begins our task. You must communicate with the different States-motions must be made in Congress, to bring this matter to some legitimate shape. Fighting as we are now, it is nothing more than a mere rebellion. Our wrongs must be thrown into form and shape, and we must draw the sword, and spread the banner to the   t breeze, with the word liberty emblazoned upon it."           i "Yes, my friend, this must be done. Thomas Jefferson entertains the same views. John Adams has already written out a draft, and I am preparing notes." "And mine are prepared, Sherman. Our friends must be urged on to immediate action. Remember, friend Sherman, that if the cause we are engaged in does not succeed, our heads are in some danger-life and death are the stakes." "My head is but a small matter in the great game; but if we succeed in rearing the great moral superstructure-this towering edifice of Independence-our names, Franklin, may occupy a small niche at its base. Names identified with this great work will be immortal."   THE TINEKER SPY. CHAPTER IX. "How secret are the goings on of night."-WILLIS. ;           rCreation sleeps."-YoUNG. "Bring along the traitor."--PLAY. Some two weeks have passed since the scene related in our last chapter occurred. Events of a startling character were hurrying on the great drama, in which nations were to take a part. The evening shades were gradually lowering over the earth; tall shadows of giant trees became a part and portion of that which rendered them dark and sombre, contrasted as they were with the dying light of day. The road leading to the Wissahickon, toward a portion of which we now conduct our readers, passed along a strip of woods, which, at that period, occupied the space, and all the ground beyond, upon which now stands the old House of Refuge. At the immediate conjunction of the road with the point of this, stood Sanford, on the evening we have alluded to above.  There was an impatient action in his every movement, and as his eyes rested a while on the main road, leading directly from the city: it seemed as if he were awaiting the approach of some one. Such was the fact. Another meet- ing was to be held on that night, on the banks of the Wissahickon, and one who was to have been his companion had not yet arrived. The mo- ments passed away; the moon was just rising, the long and silvery light of which ran, as it were, up the road, and extending through a portion of the wood, presented to view a beautiful appearance. Sanford gazed upon the scene before him, and for a while he was lost in the sublimity of nature, as its silent operations were going on before him. Night is a mystery, darkness is a mystery, light and order, the de- signs of providence, are all deep and hidden mysteries. There are deep and wonderful mysteries wrapped in the sable garments of night, and hid in its very depths of gloom- mysteries of men, mysteries of crime, and of minds, and of thought. Night should be the tomb of mind and of thought, as it is the temporary one of the body; for as it encloses the latter, so it should enshroud the former-but even here comes the mys- tery of dreams. Let us drop this, a digression which would only tend to involve us in a controversy with nature, whose very silence confounds us. Let us now return to Sanford, whose impatience, as exhibited in his actions, we have already alluded to. "Here," he muttered, "have I been standing guard for the last two hours; it is beyond the time, and not a trace of hirim can I discover. Eh, what is that?"This exclama- tion was caused by his perceiving moving figures before him.' They passed across the road, and entered the wood. Startled for a moment, he watched their movements until they were lost to view. "What can this mean? ." he asked himself. "Have they picket guards here? It cannot be, and yet I may be pursued. For two weeks have I avoided the Colonel's spies. Well, I will not remain here, but seek my friends   48           THE TINKER SPY. on the banks of the Wissahickon." So saying, he stepped out into the broad moonlight, and turned his footsteps in the direction he proposed to go. He had scarcely made two steps, when a stern voice bade him '"Halt!" and an officer, evidently, from his dress, stepped out from the wood, and stood immediately before him. "Why should I halt?" was Sanford's reply. "To answera few simple questions. First, your pass?" "I have no pass; and as I am not a stranger to you, Captain Elliott, this detention is an- outrage." "It is not for me to discuss the question. Your sword, sir; and I would ask whyr a mere citizen as you are, should go thus armed." "That question I will answer. It is to defend myself from such vil- lians as you are; so stand back, and let me pass." "Ah, this looks like treason, for which you are arrested." "Treason-fool, you do not understand the meaning of the word. I have committed no treason, although I oppose you, and the acts of your master. Stand back, I say." "Ho! there. Yousee, Master Sanford, it is useless to resist. I have a dozen men even now within call, and I may as well add, you are the very man we are in search of." "I judged so; lead on." Sanford found himself a close prisoner, and as he walked quietly on behind the Captain, a portion of the conversation between that worthy and one of his companions was not at all calculated to make him feel comfortable in his captivity. "Have you succeeded in gaining the information?" asked the Cap- tain of his companion. "Yes; I was told both were taken, and without much trouble." "What was- the cause of their running away?" "I understand that she is to be sent to England, and there compelled to marry some impoverished lord." "Where have they taken the girls?" "Down yonder, somewhere near the old barracks." "And her father." " "Oh, he is busy in organizing the troops; bad news is pouring in." "Well, let us on. Guard your prisoner well, boys, if he attempt to escape shoot him down; such are our orders." "Where is he to be taken? '" "For the present I am going to lodge him with old Mrs. Jacobs, who lives all alone in a sort of deserted mansion. I will place a guard there, and in the morning remove him to the city."   t Sanford .listened to their discourse in astonishment. That a dark and deep laid plan had been concocted, and was now being carried out, he could. not doubt. From what he had heard, it was evident that Laura and her attendant, having fled from the house, were now prisoners, and from the words of the speaker, in some place not far distant. To escape was impossible. He was strictly guarded, and if he made the attempt, his life would .no doubt pay the forfeit. He determined, however, to watch his opportunity, and evade his keepers if possible. We leave him now and turn to a new phase in our story.   -THE TINKER SPY.            49 CHAPTER X. "He sought disguise, the enemy to beguile." CIVIL WARS, B. Vnr. The greater portion of our readers are familiar with the locality of Bush Hill. What it is now, and what it was in the year 1775, furnish two distinct pictures; would we had the power of -sketching them. Bush Hill was formerly the property of Andrew Hamilton, Esq., who had erected thereon, in the year 1740, a splendid country seat, portions of which, if we are not mistaken, still remain standing. At that period it was considered far out of town, and from its height, says an old writer, 'it commanded a fair Sview of the then distant city." In the year 1793, the mansion houses and out-houses were used temporarily as a yellow fever hospital. A little south of Bush Hill, was another place, known as Springettsberry, so called after the name of William Penn's first wife. In the year 1736, a country seat was erected here, and was occupied by the Penn family. Celebrated as it was then for its wild and beautiful scenery, forests of old oaks shading the whole extent to the river Schuyl- kill, scarcely a tree remains now to mark the spot, once the pride and admiration of the citizens of the far off city. The Preston Retreat, a most admirably conducted philanthropic institution, is now on that por- tion of the premises which embraced the walks and extensive gardens. For many years the Penn family contrived to have'the place kept up in appearance, even after they ceased to make it a residence. James Al- exander, called Penn's gardener, occupied the premises, and old Virgil Warder and his wife, servant-blacks, lived there to an old age, occupying the kitchen as their home, on an annuity from the Penn family, paid to them till their deaths, about the year 1782. For many years the young people of the city--before the War of Independence-visited Spring- ettsberry in May time, to gather flowers, and to talk with and seeold gray-headed Virgil, who had always much to say about the Penns of former days. It was all enchanted ground then, especially to the young- "Where once the garden smiled, And still, where many a garden flower grew wild." It is to a portion of these grounds we now convey our readers. Much of the extensive property has been cut up and sold. Robert Morris and others purchasing grounds and erecting places thereon, soon gave it the appearance of a small village of country seats. In the old deeds we find that portion now occupied as the Preston Retreat, as belonging to one William Collins, and at the period of which we speak, a small neat dwelling house was standing thereon, in which lived an old lady by the name of Jacobs. Mrs. Jacobs had been for many years a housekeeper to Dr. Bush, the former owner of Bush Hill. After the dispersion of that family, she became housekeeper to Mr. Collins, whose erratic habits, and love of adventure, rendered her situation one of a pleasant character, inasmuch as she was for months its only inmate. Such a life suited   50           THE T INKER SPY. the old lady well-she was fond of reading, and kept a journal wherein she recorded events as they transpired around her. We have seen this journal, and from it we -take the following extracts: "1774. Visited the city--purchased a new dress. On my way home saw a man mending tin pansf' I looked at him in silent wonder-never saw two men more alike, than my master and-this tinker." Some time after, we find the old lady writing as follows: "1775. Certainly he must be a relative-the color of his hair and eyes--the very expression of his features. He was heading a mob. If he is my master, then are his dress and occdipation assumed. When he came home, dressed as a gentleman, for he is a gentleman, I told him what I had seen. He laughed and said--' every man has a double.' I wonder what he means by 'double.'" It is into this house we now convey our readers. Beside a table, upon which were some papers and a slight refreshment, sat a person with whom our readers are somewhat familiar, but in a guise so unsuited to his sex, that it required a somewhat close observation to distinguish the difference between the present occupant, and the absent Mrs. Jacobs he so closely imitated. His words will explain the mystery: "Well, so far I have escaped the Colonel's spies; he has sent men all through the country, after Sanford and myself, but in my old house- keeper's dress, it will go hard if I do not deceive them yet, and palm myself off as the venerable widow Jacobs. It is unfortunate that the discovery should have been made; it has marred all my prospects; but no matter, a few months will place spies and rebels upon a footing with the proudest in the land--at least -such spies and rebels as we are. Hark! what noise i% that? Surely I hear approaching footsteps! What can it mean?" "Holloa the house!" exclaimed a rough voice. "Who calls on old mother Jacobs?" was the response. "An officer of the king, with two prisoners, open the door." "I am a lone woman-tell me what prisoners, eh?" "Two runaway girls; they must remain here until the morning, we. have other business on hand." "Two women out at this time. Ah! a thought flashes on my mind. Stay, I will open the door." So saying, the Tinker, for he it was, opened the door, and admitted, as he had anticipated, Miss Clayton and Jane, followed by three or four soldiers. "Walk in, ladies-pretty birds! ah, ha! it does my old eyes good to see you in my house." "Prison you mean, Mrs. Jacobs; for one night your house is to be a sort of female barrack, so provide a room for Miss Clayton and her maid, to-morrow she goes elsewhere. -I shall place a guard around the house, so you need not attempt to escape." This was uttered by one of the men who acted as leader. "Escape-oh,no, Mr. Corporal, I will keep an eye on them. I am old, very old, so come along, lady- bird." So well did he imitate the gait, voice and action of Mrs. Jacobs, that all were deceived, and had no suspicion of its being the disguised Tinker,   THE TINKER SPY.            51 Miss Clayton cast a look upon Mrs. Jacobs, as she imagined her keeper to be, but said nothing. Jane, however, could not so easily remain silent, but commenced a series of close examination of the old woman. Her dress and person having finally satisfied her curiosity, she summed up the amount of her opinion in a few words, and these were uttered with a sort of savage ferocity, which had, however, very little effect on Mrs. Jacobs, whose low, chuckling laugh elicited from Jane the words, " get out, you vile old woman." Having seen the prisoners, for such in reality they were, safely pro- vided for, the soldiers departed. The supposed Mrs. Jacobs, as soon as the door was closed, approached close to the two alarmed females, and whispered the word "silence." "Hush," he continued, "no expressions or exclamations-I am-- "Law, Miss--look-" "Hush, Jane." "It is Mr. Collins," was uttered by both. "Not a word more, you are safe here, retire immediate y up stairs; I will have you some refreshments prepared--go- hark-some one at the door." By dint of entreaty, he succeeded in persuading them to retire, and' well he did, for at that moment a scuAe evidently was going on outside, and the sudden opening of the door, and the entrance of several soldiers, with a prisoner, soon explained the cause of strife. "Unhand me, ruffians," exclaimed Sanford. "Well, well, Master Sanford, have your way now, but here you re- main until morning. So good night, and remember that there is a dou- ble guard around the house." So saying, the spokesman and his companion departed. Sanford threw himself on a chair, and for a moment was lost in thought. "Well, it cannot be helped," he muttered, "I must await the issue of this, be it for weal or wo. But Laura-where-where can she be?" "Here." "Eh! who spoke-what mean you, old woman?" "Hush-silence, look up, boy." "What--do I dream-why-it is-Collins!" ' 4Hush! be as silent as the grave, treachery surrounds us; a deep plot is laid i i which we are all involved." "What does all this mean?--how came you here, and in that dress?" "This is my own house-the disguise was adopted to escape the hounds that were placed on my track-but I have foiled them. Now listen. Colonel Clayton, it seems, determined that his daughter should wed some beggarly lord in England, whom she never saw, and to place her beyond your reach, she was to have left these shores in a few days. She escaped-fled-was arrested--" "I know it, I heard the villains who brought me here, speak of it." "Well, my case is still more desperate than yours and theirs, for if I am caught, the Colonel will hatch up some hellish story about the part I have taken in this quarrel, between the colonists and the crown, and a dungeon, if not death, will be the result."   52           THE TINKER SPY. "No, he dare not!" "He dare do anything. The man who would sacrifice his daughter at the shrine of ambition, would immolate his foe at the gallows. But list- en, Sanford, the two parties sent out after you and Laura, it seems, by some strange coincidence, have brought you both to my poor house." "What! Laura here?" "Silence!" "O, let me see her-only for a moment." "Yes, and in that moment our very safety may be involved. But stay a moment, I will bring you together, for we must now all act in concert," We pass over the meeting of the lovers, and come to the most import- ant event in this night's adventure. The Tinker, who had arranged the whole plan of escape, now urged their immediate flight, observing that he knew every inch of the ground. "But the guard " observed Sanford. "I can avoid them, by a path leading through the garden, so follow me. This/way." "Not so fast, if you please," were the words which greeted them as the Tinker opened the door. A sentinel was stationed there, and his determined manner for a moment startled the party. Sanford bid him stand back, and making a motion to grasp the gun, the soldier stepped back, and presented it full against the young man's breast: "Retire into the house, or I'll fire, and in ten minutes I will have a dozen men here." "Ten minutes," muttered the Tinker--"plenty-of time; it must be done." So saying, he in his feigned voice of Mrs. Jacobs, begged them all to retire into the house, as all means were cut off for escape. "Go in, la- dies-go in, and I will secure the door." Thus speaking, he gradually approached toward where the soldier stood, when, quick as thought, he sprang upon him, hurled him into the room, and pressing him down to the floor, threatened to shoot him if he uttered an exclamation. Thun- derstruck' at the suddenness of the attack, he obeyed in silence; and find- ing himself in rough hands, he quietly submitted to be tied, and to the great joy of Miss Clayton and Jane, they once more found themselves free, and in the open air. Scarcely, however, had they reached the con- fines of a strip of wood, before they heard the shouts of their late guard, and fearful of being overtaken if they continued on the high road, they immediately sought the woods, through whose intricate windings the Tinker, as their guide, conducted them.   THE TINKER SPY.            53 CHAPTER XI. "A monastery was built near the city." HSTORY OF ENGLAND --"Oh! love can take What shape he pleases.--CORNWALL. Let us leave the fugitives for a while, and pay a visit to the Colonel whose rage scarcely knew any bounds, when he found that his daughter had escaped. "Thus," he exclaimed, "are all my plans frustrated. If she succeeds in reaching that scoundrel's hiding place, and I have no doubt it is to seek him she has fled, all is lost. His high sense of honor, and love for the girl, will induce him to propose on the instant, and thus manage to destroy at once all those high-born ideas I have conjured up in my brain, and which were to connect the name of Clayton with that of nobility. It is provoking--what, ho, there!" At the sound of his voice a servant entered, To the inquiries of his master, no news had been received of the fugitives. "Send out more men-all of you. search the city through; and mark me, if you meet in your walks that traitor and spy, the Tinker, seize ;him, and have him dragged into my  presence. Away." Having thus given vent to his feelings, the Colonel threw himself into a  chair, and for a moment was lost in deep and bitter thought. It has been said by philosophers,-that intensity of thought produces in- sanity-it over-taxes the brain, creates in its government mental revolu- tions, which, like those of a political character, not unfrequently end in ruin. The Colonel, however, was made of sterner stuff, for the result of his re- flections was the producing of a state of seeming calmness. He arose, and was just in the act of going out, when a servant rushed-in and an- nounced that the fugitives were taken, and were now in the house of Mrs. Jacobs, at Bush Hill, from whence they would he soon taken, and brought to their home. This announcement considerably relieved the Colonel; but our readers are aware, that the next report would entirely change the feature of affairs, and turn the pleasure which now sprung upon the Colonel's heart, to wild and ungovernable rage. In that state, likea hope pendulumising between its dawning and consummation, we leave him for the present, and once more follow the fugitives. Having escaped the vigilance of the picket guard, the Tinker led the little party through  the woot, and in a very short space of time, they found themselves on the banks of the Schuylkill, some three miles from the city. "Now, Sanford," he exclaimed, "we are safe; let us rest here for a while, and then we will proceed a  little higher up the river, to a small house I   have there."  "'Indeed, Collins, I am  afraid Miss Clayton will not be able to hold out."  -   54           THE TINKER SPY. "Don't think of me, Sanford,"' exclaimed Laura; " rather let us on, than be again caught and forced to accompany these bands of ruffians." "You are right," remarked Collins, "once again in their power, and all hope of-escape is lost. And here is Jane, too, what do you say, shall we on?"  "I am not tired, but I was thinking of Peter; what will he think when he finds that I have left?" "Well, Jane, it is proper for you to remember Peter; but our present safety is of more consequence than is that consideration, for Peter is safe in the household of Franklin." "Now, Collins, while we are resting here, had we not better arrange some plan, so as we can secure the safety of Miss Clayton and Jane? This little place up here is scarcely a safe retreat."       ' "I know it; to-morrow we will walk up to Wissahickon; there is an old friend of mine residing there in an old monastery; it is a wild and rugged retreat, but a superstition attached to it, deters the timid from approaching it too close." 'Tell us the legend, Collins, while we are resting here." "I am afraid, Sanford, it will alarm our companions." "No, indeed, Mr. Collins," remarked Laura. "I have so little faith in all that appertains to ghosts and apparitions, that their recital merely amuses, never alarms. Now Jane is somewhat more timid, but even she will be glad to hear something to wile away a few moments; and then the night is so beautiful- see how the stars twinkle, and reflect their diamond-like lustre on the water. O, how I like to gaze upon nature, as she calmly sleeps as it were on the bosom of night." -"Why, Laura," exclaimed Sanford, "you are quite a poet. Now I remember--will you recite those beautiful lines on night, which I once heard you repeat in your father's garden?" "But the story of Mr. Collins." "All in good time-let us have the lines first." "Well, since you insist, I'll give the lines; at least a part of that beau- tiful description of night, written by Dr. Young :, "Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne, In rayless majesty, now stretches folth Her leaden seeptre oer a slumbering world. Silence how deadI and darkness how profound! Nor eye, nor listening ear, an object finds; Creation sleeps. 'T is as the general pulse Of life-stood still, and nature made a pause; An awful pausel prophetic of her end." "That is beautiful," was the remark of 'Collins; "and yet there is an under-current of night running through its hours as does poison through the veins of man. But let that pass; I must relate- the legend of the old monastery on the Wissahickon. The old building is situated in a beautiful, though perhaps the most wild and picturesque portion of the country. The monastery was built, it is supposed, some seventy years ago, by a company of students who came from Germany. Whether they were Catholics, or a sect called Pietists, I believe has never been   THE TINKER   SPY.          55 known; but it is said that they had all; the superstitions of the church of Rome, with a portion of its crimes. Among the students was one whose surpassing beauty was the talk of the country for miles around. He was religious to a fault; that is, his religious observances were of the moist strict and impressive character. His nights were spent in prayer, his days in penance; and at last to such an extent was his zeal carried, that he, imagined himself one of the elect to redeem the world from its bondage of sin. Such was the character of Charles Morton, at the time when the incident I am going to relate occurred. There lived at that period, in Germantown, a family by the name of Warrington. Warring- ton was a widower. Two sons and one daughter composed his house- hold. The daughter was beautiful; and not unfrequently was her beauty contrasted with that of the young monk. Prompted by curiosity, Adelaide-for that was her name--often wandered down tothlle Wissa- hickon; and, to confess the truth, her chief motive was to get a glimpse of the handsome German student. They met. I will not relate all the story; how they again met-how he. loved-how she loved-and how, at last, she disappeared, and was never heard of afterward. Some time , after her disappearance, another student was added to the few who in- habited the monastery, whose beauty, it was stated, surpassed that of Morton. But, as the inmates of the monastery were seldom seen by those residing outside of its walls, the report of the addition to their number, and the beauty of the novitiate, soon ceased to be the subjects of conversation. "Time passed. Adelaide's father's grief ended with his death; her brothers went abroad, and the household was broken up. Then came another startling report; it was carried, as it were, on the winds through- out the country. Morton had fled the monastery-not alone-the youngest student had fled with him; and then came the horrid truth- that the -new comer was a female. Her dress remained behind, and other evidences which went to prove her identity with the long-lost daughter of Warrington." "Dreadful!" exclaimed Laura; "but, go on." "Well, time passed; years rolled away; the order was broken up; the building fell into other hands; and now comes the most horrible portion of the legend." Jane, who had, during the telling of the story, listened with the most breathless attention, could no longer contain her terror, but, rising'from her seat, she came round to where Collins was sitting, and sidling up, got as near to him as delicacy and fear permitted her. Collins con- tinued: "A man by the name of Edward Miller purchased the building when old Conrad Mathias, the last of the order, left it to live the life of a her- mit. In making some alterations in one wing of the building, the work- men discovered what had once been a recess which had evidently been bricked up.  As it was -necessary to make such alterations as would take in this space, the additional wall was removed. Stone by stone was taken down.   A sickening vapor seemed to arise from a sort of vault, and a crackling, as of something falling, induced the men to push the work on rapidly.  As they proceeded, the same deadening vapor   THE TINKER SPY. arose, and the continued crackling of something, the sound of which was indescribable. At last the wall was removed, and, to their horror and surprise, two skeletons fell out from the recess, and there they lay --the last sad remains, as it is supposed, of Charles Morton and Ade- laide Warrington. Thus ends the legend."   A deep silence followed the recital of this story, and Jane almost clung to the dress of Collins, which, by the way, our readers must re- member, was that of the housekeeper of M r. Jacobs. "Collins," said Sanford. " this is a wild story, and, I am afraid, will have a tendency to affect the spiits of your two listeners. Jane looks particularly alarmed ." "I must confess," remarked Laura, "that the sad legend has made me feel melancholy; but, as there was no ghost -- By the ay, interrupted Collins , forgot all about the ghost part. A few words  wil tell that. To this day, it is said, t forms are seen, at the dead hour of night, wandering d in hand in on the banks of the Wissahickon. So now let is proceed a few steps further, and we will reach what I call my fishing house, and then we can arrange for the future; so come along."   The party now proceeded with more cheerfulness. Laura was lean- ing with all theconfidence of youth and hope, on the arm of him she loved, whle Jane, with  . equal confidence but less romance, absolutely caung, as it were, to the iron frame of the Tinker. It was near mi - night when they reached the fisherman's hut. CHAPTER XII. What is revenge, but courage to call in Our honor's debts, and wisdom to convert Other's self love unto our own protection?-YousG. approaching a climax. The elements of a revolutionary spirit were now congregating into one vast storm, which was shortly to break over the American continent. It is not our purpose to swell up the incidents of, our storywith te manv startling scenes which were enacted during that period, but to proceed with our characters who, in their capacity of historians, must furnish such portions as are connected with their acts. We left Collins, Sanford, and the two females, in the fisherman's hut, 7where they provided for the accommodation of Miss Clayton and Jane, who were pleased with the comfort as well as the neatness the little hut presented. After they had retired to rest, Sanford, having stripped off the habiliments with which he' was encumbered, and putting on a fish- erman's dress, made arrangements for their own accommodation for the night. A small table, upon which was placed a light, afforded an   opportunity for the two men, who were thus thrown sostrangely together, to observe what effect the excitement of the last few days had had upon each. Collins was the first- to speak. - Sanford," he observed, "yon bear the fatigue of travel and the-ex- citement of the times much better than I anticipated. You are a bold fellow, and your conduct pleases me." "I am glad of it; for I must confess that, as my life has been some- what of a chequered one, the good opinion of at least one bold man, and that one my friend-and yet, Collins--" "Yes; I know what you would say. The time has arrived for me to speak upon a subject which has heretofore been as a-sealed book to X you. The interest I have taken in you; the anxiety with which I have watched over you; my placing you in a situation in Colonel Clayton's household--unknown, however, to him.; the supplying you with money and other means to advance you--has all been, I know, a source of un- easiness to you; but I had a motive-nay, you had a claim upon me." "A claim?" "Aye; nay, I may as well tell you at once: Sanford, you are my !    nephew."  My uncle?"                      ' "Yes-your mother's brother. Now listen. Colonel Clayton wooed your mother, my sister. She hated him, spurned him, and wedded a noble-minded man, named Chamberlain. This was in England. Shortly after their marriage, business called us to Rouen, in the north of France. We settled there. Strange, but it so happened that Colonel Clayton came hither too. At that time his fortunes were desperate, and I be- lieve he was compelled to quit England on that account. He joined a secret society, of which one, in the then distracted state of France, was established in every city. Of their character you already know some- thing. Vile and treacherous, without one ennobling quality, its mem- bers resorted to all sorts of means to increase their power, as well as their wealth. We lived privately. I was young then. Through the influ- ence of a public man, I obtained a situation in an office, which I after- wards ascertained was connected with the society in question. T, how- ever, discovered it. Colonel Clayton had never forgotten the slight your mother put upon him. He watched your father; his every move ment was reported to the tribunal; he was suspected of some political crime; he was tried-convicted-murdered." "Murdered? Gracious heaven!" ?i$:"Aye, murdered; for what is it but murder, when human life is sac- rificed at the shrine of vengeance i" "Good heavens! But you do not mean that Colonel Clayton-" "Silence!-not so loud. There are those near us whose ears must be deaf to the sounds which would imply guilt to him. Yet, boy, it was Colonel Clayton who pursued your father. I may be wrong, but I fear that revenge, not the ends of justice, urged him on." "Can he be so base?" "Let us hope not. Your poor mother died. I left Rouen and went, to Paris; I took you along. I left France, went to London, and had you placed in a school there. Events of a political character caused me 4  t3 ZTIIE TINKER SPY. to quit England. I arrived in America, selected out Philadelphia, and -you know the rest; at least, you do not know that, by a sort of fatality, Clayton was also here, holding a Colonel's commission in the army of the king. I have always been opposed. to the name, and therefore joined the rebels." "But--"' Listen. Time had erased my image from the Colonel's memory. He knew me not; but I knew him; and then arose that deep, dark spirit of our nature-evil in the form of vengeance. I dwelt upon the wrongs he had committed; I recalled my sister's image--your father's noble qualities; I pictured, in my moments of passion, his lone grave in a far distant land. All these things maddened me, and I then re- gretted-.-aye, Sanford, I regretted-that I had had you educated in the paths of virtue. Nay, start not; I was maddened with my reflections; I sought revenge; and I determined to wrong him, through his only child-and you were-to be the instrument." "Power of mercies!" exclaimed Sanford. "Aye-such was my nature then. I used my influence to get you a place with him. I succeeded. Time was doing its work; you loved, and Laura returned that love. Then my mind underwent a change. A gleam of soft moonlight seemed to come down on my soul of gloom, and lit up hope there. Yet, so stubborn was my nature, that I watched your actions at a distance. I joined, as you know, the secret band. I adopted the character and business of a tinker; it afforded me chances and opportunities of obtaining information which-I could not otherwise have had. I met Jane; her innocence warmed my heart of winter. Our actions in the street, among the people, were noticed; we were marked out, for an example. I insulted the Colonel openly, in the street; I was seized, and dragged a prisoner to his house. How I escaped, you are partly informed; but you do not know that I had him down-my knee Was on his breast, my- poignard at his throat, when Laura rushed in, and I spared him. It is past now. You love his daughter, and the sins of the-father should not be visited on his child." Yours is an eventful story." "Aye, and an over true one. But, now listen, Sanford.. To-morrow, we take the girls to the house of a lady of my acquaintance, on the Wissahickon. She is wealthy, lives retired, and there they can remain in safety." "But what are we to do? I am suspected, and sought after." "So am I; but to-moirow we -go to Philadelphia; to-morrow we pre- sell ourselves in the. streets; and as the blow has been struck, and the blood of our countrymen has been shed, let us boldly confront our foes, and maintain :our position." "Such are my views. 'Now, uncle, come weal, come woe, our fates are united." "' Give me your hand, boy; and now, ere we lie down, let us pray for those who have gone before us, and for those who are with us, and de- pendeniit upon us. I am not a praying man, Sanford; but thought is prayer, ahn- I have thought much. Let us give it utterance." A prayer-was made. It came up from a heart as pure as the, hearts   of many who claim the right, by education, to pray. The prayer of such a man as Collins, uttered under the circumstances we have detailed, went up to the throne of mercy, as free from the elements of earth, as those that are breathed in cushioned pulpits. Prayer will either make a man leave off sinning, or sin will make him leave off praying. But even constant prayer, -without a sense of its obligation, can never make a man good. It is the hope that dwells in the heart of a sinner who prays, that awakens him to a sense of his evil doings. Prayer, therefore, "will soften strong hearts, and bring repentance to a sinful soul." CHAPTER XIII. "And so he put them into the prison house, and Made the doors be shut after them."-PLUTARaH, 668. What has become of Peter all this while? Alas! did Jane but know that while she was comparatively happy on the banks of the Wissahickon with her beloved mistress, her poor brother was the inmate of a prison. To account for his sad fate, it is necessary to go back a few days, and give some account of those who were left behind, after the flight of the Tinker and Sanford. Colonel Clayton, immediately after he had ascertained the second escape ,of the fugitives, called upon a certain Cunningham, "a wicked, passion- ate Irishman, of about sixty years of age." This man had charge of what was then called "the British Prevost," since known as the Walnut Street Prison, corner of Walnut and Sixth streets. He had under his charge upwards of nine hundred American prisoners. Many of these were dragged from their homes on mere suspicion of being members of secret societies inimicable to the British government. Crowded into this building, ill-treated, and badly fed, numbers of them died there of hun- ger and cold, and were daily carried out and interred in the thenPotters' Field, now the Washington Square, close by. To this wretch did Clay- ton apply, as one whose services might be useful in his purposes of re- venge on Collins, and the restoration of his fugitive child. The very name of money was in itself sufficient, and the Captain immediately es- poused the cause of his friend. Having obtained all the information of the' parties, and even that of their friends, among whom the name of Peter Morris was included, the' Colonel left his new ally with a much lighter heart than when he entered the modern Bastile, over which Cun- ningham ruled with autocrat power. As this man Cunningham is scarcely known to the general reader, and that portion of our revolutionary history scarcely, alluded to by historians, it may not be out of place to furnish some account of him, as well as the events which occurred in the old prison under his iron rule. Cunning- ham was, previous to the breaking out of the war, a well known and noted bully. He was made a captain by General Clinton, to save him from merited punishment in case of capture. While in New York in   60           THE TINKE R SPY. Maorh, 1775, he got into a fight at the liberty pole-he there offended the people; they made him and a companion named Hill go down upon their knees and curse the king. They exclaimed, "God bless him! ' and they were severely beaten. This rankled in his breast ever after, and most fearfully did, he satisfy his vengeance. That our readers may not suppose for a moment we are drawing upon the imagination for incidents connected with our revolutionary history, to render our legend one of romance, we give extracts from Jacob Ritter's "Facts of the Prisoners. at the Walnut Street Prison," furnished to a gentleman of this city, in the year 1833. He had been found, while sick in a farmhouse, by the Hessians, who beat and kicked him as a " rebelle," and bore him off to the city. . At this place he and the others were three days and nights without any food. He saw one soldier who had eaten nothing till his fifthday,-when he saw him get a piece of rye bread, and he actually, as he says, "saw him topple off his seat on the prison steps dead, while he was in the act of eiting.  Mr. Ritter says he was often beaten and bruised severely with the butt-end of .Cunningham's whip. On one occasion Mr. Ritter saw a poor starving Virginian, who had been several days Without food, looking wist- fully at, some biscuits which had been sent to some newly arrived citizens, prisoners brought in on suspicion. Moved by compassion for the distress -of the starving man, and forgetting his own similar need, he made out to slip unperceived to where they lay in a keg, and, getting one, he gave it to his starving companion. The man acknowledged afterwards that he owed to his timely assistance the preservation of his life. As the winter advanced the prisoners became excessively cold. They I, had no extra coverings for sleeping, and the window-frames being much broken, the cold and snow entered therein freely; they huddled together for warmth. He had seen soup brought for them, and set down at the prison door in vessels, which, when seen by Cunningham on his visit, were kicked over with a curse on the rebel dogs. On such occasion he has seen the poor starved prisoners, when near enough to profit by it, fall upon their knees and hands, and eagerly lap up the wasted liquid. Among numerous other outrages detailed in Ritter's Facts, we give one and the last. It was the case of a poor drummer-boy, who begged the wretch to allow him a little food and liberty to go home, pleaded his youth, and his inability to do the British army harm. Cunningham told him, that if he would kneel down and kiss the prison stone steps he would give him food. The poor boy did so instantly, and then claimed his reward. 'With a brutal aiigh he bid him go home-and this is re;  lated as the only one good act, if it can be so called, that the wretch was ever known to be guilty of Such was the man who was now engaged-by Colonel Clayton to hunt up  -  Is runaway daughter, and secure the persons of th6oe who aided and assisted in her 'fight. Haviig obai ed all the parfioulars, and the names of the parties, his first act was to secure the person of Peter Morris, of whose whereabouts Le soon made himself acquainted. This was easily accomplished. Peter was seized in the street, and immedi- ately thrown into the prison, among those whose sufferings we have al- ready alluded to. ,    THE TINKER SPY.            61 Peter, somewhat surprised, was not long, however, kept in suspense at the cause of his arrest. C So, sir," said Captain Cunningham, "you are named Peter Morris " "Peter Morris is my name-I am not ashamed of it." "Silence, sir, and answer me a few questions." "How can I answer, if I am to remain silent?" "Rascal, do you see this stick?" "Yes--it is a good one, let me see it; by Jupiter, but this is all gold, aint it, Captain? ' sisThe head is gold, fool. Now answer me--do you know where vour sister is?" "No, sir, I do not-wish I did." "No prevarication, sirrah." "Well, I do not know." "We will try bread and water, that is a most excellent-counsellor-it unloosens the tongue." "Yes, I should say it would; but if it is to make me tell what I do not know; I am afraid you will have to reduce the allowance to water only, and even then I doubt-whether, to prolong life, I'd tell a lie." "W11, we will try both.  Now, one more question-your sister ac- companied Miss Clayton, did she not ', "Yes-at least I think so."' "And, one more--do you know a Mr. Collins?" "Do IA  Yes, indeed-what, the Tinker?" "Ah, is that theman?  Would I had himin may power. Soyouseem to know something of this rebel! That will justify your detention. Into that room there." So saying, he gave Peter a push, and he found himself in a room of the prison, in which there were crowded some thirty or forty human beings, suffering all the pangs hunger-, and the absence of pure  air, can insic Peters ingenuity,  after one or two d ays imprisonment shon provided for their wants, and in a short time the inmates of that room became quite contented with their situation. The room in which they were confined, fronted immediately on Sixth street; the opening of a window was sufficiently wide to admit a basket; a prisoner happened to have one, in which a friend had smuggled some provision, shortly after his incarceration- Having secured a strmge Psote attached the basket to it, and writing a few words on a card, it was lowered out of the window.  On the card these words were written: a '-In the room from which this basket is lowered there are thirty starv- ing prisoners. Give us food, for the sake of Liberty. When the basket is full, pull the strin." W The situation of the window was such that a view of the street could not be obtained, so Peter held on the string, and awaited, as he said, a ite!' It was a  curious scene to see those' thirty brave, suffering' men, seated on the  floor, starvation in their'lo6okd, awaiting, as Peter remak ed, a nibble." His lively humor kept their spirits up,and a smile ,cca- sionall y passed over their countenances, resembling how ever} more the pale moonbeams on a graveya, -than the cheerfu1 Sunshiie' .on a bed of flowers.   THE TINKER SPY "Ah!" was the exclamation of Peter, which at once attracted the at- tention of the prisoners. :  "Ah! a nibble--a bite--a haul." So saying, he pulled up the basket, and to their great surprise, it was crammed with food, and a small flask 'of wine. Great was the joy of that little community, on the receipt of this store of good things. The plan was contrived, which yielded them more than sufficient for all their wants. It was on the fifth day of Peter's imprisonment that he was called out, and conducted into the presence of Cunningham. He found that worthy in ompan  with an old Quaker gentleman. Well, Masteri Peter," exclaimed Cuningham, "we have found out where your sister is, and this worthy gentleman will conduot you to her." Peter was much surprised at  this announcement--there was treachery in it, he Well knew, for he was fully aware that his imprisonment was in- directly, if not directly, in consequence of her disappearance. Why the place of her sojourn should thus make any change in his situation, was mystery. Peter looked at Cunningham, and then at the Quaker. The latter's face was partly hid from view; there was, however, in the ex- pression of the countenance of the former, something so devilish, that he was more than ever convinced that there was an underplot of this new play. "Well, Peter, you are silent." ' "I have nothing to say, sir; if my sister is safe, I am satisfied-I do, not wish -to lesave here." At that moment the Quaker turned his head-a finger was raised up to the lip-one look was sufficient-Peter recognized Collins.  , "What! " exclaimed Cunningham; " prefer a prison to liberty, and the society of a sister? ungrateful scoundrel, as you are,'I will horse-whip you in the yarid of the prison, before the nine hundred rebels I hae underychage.    Won    go ,o What ho, there." As he spoke, five men, dressed in a sort of military garb, entered. "Here, sir .'.., guard this unnatural scoundrel to where this honest Quaker will conduct you, and see that he safely arrives to where his sis- ter is now held a prisoner. Now, Mr. Williams," addressing the Quaker, "you understand--have. them all brought here, or rather, the two vil- lans, Collins and Sanford, the. girls can be taken at once to Colonel Clayton's.' "I will obey thy instructions-in three hours they will be in my pow- er-in three more--" "In mine-ha !  ha ! good." So saying, the Quaker, Peter, and the five soldiers left the prison, and the Captain waved his hand to them as they passed up Sixth street. As he turned upon his heel, these words escaped him: "There goes an honest Quaker. Peter will lead him to his sister, and then-what is this . ' The cause of this exclamation, was a letter whichh le espied lying on the table which stood in the passage way. "Eh! addressed to me-what is it."- It is impossible to describe the expression of his countenance, while   THE TINKER SPY.            63 reading the letter. Passion, in its wildest form, agitated it; his eyes flashed; he stamped until the walls shook; and when he had finished reading it, he threw himself upon a chair, utterly convulsed. The letter contained the following words: $$TO CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM. "Sir--While you are reading this, the writer, Collins, the Tinker, Quaker, &cc., will be far away. He adopted the stratagem so effectually carried out, to rescue an innocent man from your clutches.' The where- abouts of Miss Clayton and Jane Morris are known to me, and their safety will be my object. I say, to me, for the five soldiers which Colo- nel Clayton sent by me to carry out the design, and whom I also de- ceived, were dismissed ere I reached the prison, and the five substituted were of my own choosing. Mr. Sanford commanded the party. So you see, Captain, the Tinker has worked to some purpose in this-business. Farewell. TBin TINKER, "P. S.-Captain, take care of your neck, there is plenty of rope in this country." We now leave the Captain, and as we shall not have occasion to al- lude to him again in this legend, the completion of his worthless life we give here. - After the revolution; this man's character and cruelty were so well known, that he found it necessary for his personal safety, to flee to England. Depraved by nature, as well as education, this wretched man committed forgery, and ended a life of wickedness and crime, on the gallows.  Collins and his little party continued on their way, marching in a quiet, soldierlike manner up Sixth street, until they reached Vine. At that period, the houses were few beyond that street, and they took a short cut through the fields, which led them to Bush Hill, where, in the house of Collins, we leave them to concoct measures, the consequence of which will be detailed in another chapter. CHAPTER XIV. "Behold them rise, erect and free As heaven and nature meant mankind to be.-MOORB. "We march by night."-OLD SoNG. "So, sir," says Franklin, to his man Peter, who having detailed the manner of his arrest and escape, "So, you have tasted a little of Cun- ningham's prison fare? , Well, we will spoil his appetite shortly, and make the walls of that human sepulchre shake. Aye, boy-but no   "          THE TINKER SPY. more of this; here are three letters, which I want you to deliver imme- diately, to Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Thomas Paine. Stay, I 'will give their'directions. Mr. Jefferson resides at the S. W. corner .of Market and Seventh streets; it is the only house on that side of the street, after you pass Sixth. Mr. Adams is at the Indian Queen, South Fourth street; you know the place. Thomas Paine-let me see--I have his address here; ah! here it is-the Prussian Inn, Market street,/below Fourth. Now, Peter, deliver them immediately, for it is necessary they should receive them by three o'clock.'" Peter having secured the letters, started immediately to fulfill his commission. The events of 1775, immediately preceding the great one of declar- ing the colonies free and independent States, we have already alluded to. The British being repulsed on several occasions, gave the people confidence, and a spirit of daring seemed to have silenced all fear and scruples, which, no doubt, had kept many in the background. In that year the breach between Great Britain and her colonies was daily be- coming wider, and the contending parties, particularly in the cities, kept, as if by, mutual consent, at a respectful distance from each other. The ablest pens were employed throughout America, in the winter of 1775- '6, on the momentous question of a complete separation from the mother country. The propriety and necessity of the measure was enforced in te numerous gazettes; and in pamphlets. Among the latter, "Com- mon Sense," from the popular pen of Thomas Paine, produced a won- derful effect in the different colonies, in favor of independence. Influ- ential individuals in every colony urged it as a step absolutely necessary to preserve the rights and liberties, as well as to secure the happiness and prosperity of America. The following language was used by Wil- liam Henry Drayton, Chief Justice -of South Carolina:--"The Almighty created America to be independent of Great Britain; let ius beware of the impiety of being backward to act as instruments in the Almighty's hand, now extended to accomplish his purpose; and by the completion of which alone, America, in the nature of human affairs, can be secure against the crafty and insidious designs of her enemies, who think her power and prosperity already too great. In a word, our piety and polit- ical safety are so blended, that to refuse our labors in this divine work, is to refuse to be a great, a pious and a happy people." Such was the state of affairs at the close of the year 1775. Business of all kinds was suspended; social. intercourse destroyed; and doubt, like a night pall, hung as it were over the country. Not unfrequently crowds would collect around some beer house, or in front of the Old01 Coffee House, South Second street, and the expressions of sentiment were uttered, as if death stood with its fearful dart in their presence. Such a group was formed in front of the old Wigwam Tavern, South Fifth street, on the evening that Peter was commissioned to deliver the letters to the persons we have already named. The subject was in rela- tion to the ill treatment the prisoners were receiving at the hands of Cunningham. "I tell you," says one, "I saw their skeleton-looking hands thrust out from the bars of the prison, and heard their feebli cries for bread." i1   THE TINKER SPY.            6g "Aye," cried another, "here is one who can tell you more"This was addressed to Peter, who at that moment appeared in sight. "He lives with Mr. Franklin." As Peter approached he was greeted by the crowd, for the popularity of -Franklin caused a marked degree of courtesy to be extended to his household. Aye, exclaimed Peter, "I can tell you things that will make your very hair. rise up."- The crowd gathered around him, and listened with the most intense silence to the description he gave of the treatment of the prisoners. Every feature was as iron--the stern expression was unchanged during the recital, and when he ended, a voluntary expression of revenge came forth from the crowd, as one voice. It was a voice of thunder, and it went forth in reverberating sounds throughout the city. Every eye now turned in the direction of the prison. One voice, however, was heard; it mentioned one name-that of "Clayton." "Aye!" exclaimed another, "he is at the bottom of all this; the scoundrel Cunningham is but as a tool of the Colonel and his party, and thus are our countrymen treated." "Vengeance," cried out several of the party. "Down with the prison!" yelled another. "Not so fast, boys-let us go to work cautiously," remarked the first speaker; "our very words and actions are watched, here is not the pro- per place to discuss matters-meet me to-night, at the Billet, and invitp all the boys, for if we agree, this night shall not pass over without teach- ing the enemies of our country a lesson they will not forget. Hush! No expression-and Peter Morris, a word with you; breathe not a word of this to Benjamin Franklin; he is opposed to all mobs, but if you see Collins and Sanford, tell them that the boys meet at the Billet to-night "I will, and you can rely on my silence; my master wouldhave the militaryon us in a moment, for he has a way of doing things, different "Now, boys, let us disperse. Remember the Billet." A  cold, drizzly rain, which began to fall about four o'clock, promised a disagreeable, if not a boisterous night. Within the city, and even far beyond its limits, small companies of soldierswere to be seen, and judg- isng om their actions, the orders must have been strict, for a more sys- temized mode of parade and- caution were observable in their every step. In front of the State House, some twenty men were stationed. They were playing the tattoo on the stone pavement, with their feet, and other peliar actions natural to men laboring under the influence of the damp and cold.  Oaths were not spared in denouncing Colonel Clayton, who it seems had issued orders to the effect that a strict vigilance should be observed throughout the city, and on this night his orders were partic- ularly severe. Some of the soldiers expressed themselves, in words loud enough to be heard across the street, to this effect: D-n the  upstart, he thinks it nothing for us to stand here in the wet and cold  , while he enjoys the comforts of a fire, and a splendid mansion. Ah!  here comes the Corporal; now boys for a glass of brandy and. a cheerful fire.",  "          THE TINKER SPY.  But he was disappointed; the orders were to move on, and the mys- tery of their journey was maintained by the most provoking silence on the part of the officers. CHAPTER XV. The populace, the scum that rises upmost when the nation boils.--DBYDbN. The shades of night were closing around, and the lingering light, which came down through mist and rain, soon became commingled with and was lost in the density pervading all space. The few scattering lamps of which the city boasted, and badly lighted at that; shed but an imperfect glare along the pavements, scarcely suffi- cient to point out to the pedestrian the dangers which lay in his path. Without noticing, however, the difficulties of the way, and alike disre- garding the inclemency of the weather, two men walked rapidly along one of the main streets. They are well known to our readers, being no others than Collins and Sanford. - Come along, Sanford, we have but little time to spare. I would not have his house attacked before we reach there for the richest gem in the land. Bad as he is, and I so much wronged by him, his safety now is of more importance to my honor and conscience than was his death in my moment of hate and vengeance," "True," replied Sanford, "and Hbut hark! surely I hear a bell. Is it not the signal bell? And now, listen-the heavy tread of armed men."   - "The military are out, and the mob are prepared for them." "Will they attack the prison?.  "No; but I have every reason to fear they will commence with Colo- nel Clayton's dwelling. Come, let us on."  After walking some fifteen minutes through several streets, they stop- ped in. front of the dwelling' of Colonel Clayton. The knocker was sounded, and answered by a servant dressed in a sort of military garb. "' Tell the Colonel that two gentlemen wish to speak to him on busi- ness of importance." The servant ushered them into the parlor, and in a few moments re- turned with the Colonel. The light from a brilliant lamp, suspended from a ceiling, illuminated the vast saloon, and as Collins and Sanford arose at his approach, he at once recognized them. "AAh!" he ex- claimed, "what means this trick What ho, there!" "Colonel Clayton-a moment-be advised," were the words addressed to him by Collins, "Whatever views you may have towards us of a hostile character, they will avail you but little here. In one hour your house will be surrounded by an armed and excited mob-your life and property- " ,.  "Are my own, sir; and I am prepared for your-vile comrades. And a   THE TINKER SPY.           67 you, sir," addressing Sanford, "how dare you approach me You, the thief who hast stolen away my child." "Colonel Clayton," remarked Sanford, "your passion has got the bet- ter of your judgment. I did not steal your daughter. It was of her, and for her, that I am here. She is in safety, and under the protection of a lady. I am in no wise ccnnected with her absence from you, fur- ther than the assisting to rescue herfrom the hands of hireling sol- diery, who dragged her in the dead hour of the night to a temporary prison." "Ah! is this so?" "It is, sir, and your daughter-" "No longer is she my daughter. All ties between us are broken. She has deserted me, and I have disinherited her. And know, sir, that even now I await the approach of my notary to sign a will, which cuts her off with a shilling. Ha! ha! boy, how do you like that?" "So well, Colonel Clayton, that if he were here now, my uncle and myself would both witness the instrument with pleasure." "Aye, sir, my nephew speaks the sentiments of my heart." "You may have a chance of doing so, for if I mistake not he is here now."  At that moment the door opened, and there entered a man whom it is only necessary to announce as a notary, for to describe one is a stereotype of them all. "Ah," exclaimed the Colonel, "just in time, sir. There, open the in- strument, get the pen and ink, I have here two witnesses ready. Let me see the will-ah, good-all my estates to-yes, money in the funds, bills, mortgages-good; and my daughter-ah, right. Well, sirs, will you sign, eh " "Certainly." "And you, Sanford-you who love my daughter-take her with a shilling, eh " "Aye, sir, with even less than that-for in the shilling lies hidden an insult. I love her for her virtues, her noble character, and for that love she bears an unnatural father; nay. frown not; you have given me your daughter- 'she is mine." "I gave her-" "Yes, for you asked me if I would take her with a shilling. At your word-yes; therefore she is mine-no longer yours. Now, sir, sign the will, and we will witness it." For a moment the Colonel was staggered. The cool yet respectful conduct of Sanford, the stern, fearless mamner of Collins-even at a time when the soldiers were in search of him--for a while entirely subduec him. It was, however, but for a'moment. Uprising as it were from the ashes of pity, to which for a space his hate was reduced, the Colonel sooi recovered his former self, and with a malignant sneer on his countenance, wished Sanford joy with his beggared bride. Collins so far had controlled his temper-this last insult was too much for his nature to bear.. He walked deliberately up to Clayton, iolded his arms across his breast, and thus answered him- "Colonel Clayton, a short time back I had you in my power, with e knife at your throat. You are in my power now. Aye, start-you are   O8 IhTHE T I41Ji SPY. in my power, and it was to save you that I am here, You have scorned my well-meant advice and warning-you have added insult to wrong. Now, sir, I am here your peer-aye, your peer in everything'that makes up the man of honor. I have forgiven you the wrong done to those near and dear to me. I did this for the sake of your lovely and ac-  complished daughter. You have disowned, discarded her-I here adopt her. She is now my daughter, and by all the powers of heaven and hell, if you breathe a word, or curl that haughty lip, in mockery of her, I'll dash you to the earth, as I did in the block house. You know me. And now, to convince you of our disinterested motives, here we are to sign the will, which yon trembling specimen of a man now holds in his hands." Colonel Clayton, convulsed with rage, seized a pen and grasping the docuiment, rushed to a table, and in an instant the instrument was signed. "There-now. sign, and while you do so, know that your boy-your nephew-marries the daughter of a man whose property is valued at a million of dollars, and she is disinherited--ha! haha! This is a glo- rious triumph."  / "It is indeed a glorious triumph. Colonel," said Collins, as he signed it. "A triumph of which am. proud," exclaimed Sanford, as he signed. "'A triumph," muttered the notary, as he attested the signatures, "of which I do not understand one word." It was a strange picture. There stood four men-in the bosoms of each various passions contended for the mastery. One, and only one, however, had no sympathy in thought or feeling with the others, and he was the notary, who, having accomplished his work, departed. ," Now, sirs, our business ip finished," roared out the Colonel, whose voice swelled to its utmost tension with choler and passion. "It is," replied Collins; "but still there remains thee object of our mission. There is a riotous spirit abroad to-night, and it would be well, Colonel, to-hark! by heaens, I hear the tread of men: Sanford, to the door!"  "Stir at your peril," thundered the Colonel "You are leagued with these scoundrels. Know that I have heard of these outhreaks, and there are fifty armed men now in the block house attached to these grounds." "I am glad of it. I will go forth and speak to these men, and will endeavor to save the necessity of bloodshed." , "Do as you like, so you leave the house." At that moment a loud shout was heard, and the crash of falling tim- ber shopk th bulding. '  "By heavens; the illains have broken through the gateway!" In an instantt-he rushed to the window opening out to the. block house, and gave a-peculiar whistle, which was immediately answered by the heavy tread of troops. "Ha! you see how I will meet these men." He looked round, Collins and Sanford had disappeared..  In front of the hoJuse there was assembled an immense crowd, cdm- posed of the masses which make ip what is called tle. people. Words were uttered of a highly treasonable character;-the/ names of leading men were. branded as cut-throats, assassins, and murderers-:the names of Clayton and Cunningham were mingled with those of others-and as i o       ,   THE TINKER SPY.           69 the light of numerous flambeaus glared down upon their upraised faces, the whole scene presented an animated pandemonium. Foremost among the rioters was seen Collins. He addressed them in language strong and forcible-urged upon them the impropriety of their proceedings. Shouts drowned his voice. Sanford assayed to speak, but his voice was lost in the din. Suddenly the front chamber of Claytoi's house became illuminated-it was a sort of unnatural light, a flash-and then came the roar of musketry, followed by groans and screams from the assailants. Collins looked around him. Part of the mob Had disappeared, but those that remained, now having recovered, dashed toward the dwelling, and in an instant the doors and windows yielded to their attacks. As the door opened, beyond the long corridor was seen a detachment of soldiery, placed on the stairway leading to the upper chambers. Those who composed the mob were men unaccustom- ed to warfare, but they had seen their friends shot down in the open street before this night's work-they had seen their fellow men dragged from their homes, and imprisoned-they had seen their skeleton forms through the bars of a prison, and heard their low tones for charity, ask- ing for food. They had witnessed these outrages, and it was the thought and knowledge of all these things that now urged them on to acts, if not deeds, of vengeance. The barbarous spirit of centuries passed seem- ed, as it were, once more resumed in the bosoms of men whose feelings heretofore were of a kindly nature, its brutal characteristics. With mad- ened fury they rushed through the long entry, and before the soldiers had received orders to fire, a personal 'onffict ensued, which resulted in the complete overthrow of the assailed party. At that moment, as they were ascending the stairway, two forms ap- peared. Bold and determined they stood, sword in hand. In an instant the mob halted, and as the light glared down upon the group, the well- known features of Collins and Sanford were discernable. "Out of our .way, Collins," said a voice; "we must have vengeance- blood has been spilt." "But no life," thundered forth the Tinker. "Back, I say. You have committed an outrage of a gross character. Did you not lead these misguided men to believe that you simply in- tended to ask for the liberation of the nine hundred prisoners, now in the keeping of that villain, Cuhningham?" Shouts of "yes, yes," now resounded through the crowd. At that moment, and most unfortunately, Colonel Clayton, accompa- nied by several soldiers, appeared on the stairway. In a voice in which the key of passion was the highest, he ordered the men to disperse the mob. The word fire was given, but eke it was obeyed, a ringing sound, a flash, and the report of a pistol startled all, for it came as it were up from the crowd. A groan followed, and the tall form of Colonel Clay- ton was caught in the extended arms of Collins. Before Sanford could oppose the act, several shots were fired by the soldiery, without doing much injury, as the mob, alarmed at the consequence of the rash act of some one in the crowd, were now rapidly retreating, and in a few mo- ments the house was cleared of all those who came hither with a hostile intent. The lifeless form of the Colonel was carried into the parlor, and    T0           THE TINKER SPY. laid on an ottoman. Collins immediately examined the wound, called for some liniment and bandage, poured some wine iqto the mouth of the sufferer, and announced to those that surrounded, as it were the couch of death, that the wound was not dangerous. In a few moments the - Colonel opened his eyes; they rested upon Collins, who was supporting him, and whose hand had just administered a soothing draught. He closed them again, as if to shut out memory. Opening them again, and recognizing Sanford and others, he muttered thanks, in a feeble, though expressive manner. Collins assured him the wound was slight, and that he scarceiv needed a physician, he himself having dressed theUwound. The ball had struck a nerve, which caused a deadening sensation, which, with the loss of blood, rendered him insensible for a time. The events 6of the past now rose up before him. The whole scene was vividly placed to his; view by the power of memory, which is the true artist of the soul, as it is of nature and of truth. In the few moments that followed, consciousness of whole years were impressed. The past faded away gradiually, and as it were impercept- ibly--the dark scenes of his after life appeared as phantoms-and the better thoughts which now arose in his soul were the promptings of re- pentance. He called the captain of the soldiery to his couch and whspered a few words in his ear. The officer bowed, and calling his men together, left the room. Colonel Clayton, Collins, and Sanford were now alone. '"Did you say the wound was not dangerous, sir?"          . "I did, but to reassure you I have sent for a physician." "It is well. Collins, give me your hand--Sanford, yours. There, I feel easier now. Yet I have two things to perform, The first is in re- lation to your father's fate, Sanford. I was not altogether earried away ;by vindictive feelings; the evidence of my participation in his persecu- tion embraced that of others, more subtle and base than H-think I was; and yet he was leagued -with-no matter-no matter, he was for freedom, I, for monarchy, as you are for the one now, and I for mon- archy still. Let that pass. The other is this: I may die from the wound, and, O God, what a wrong would it have been, had I fell dead upon the spot, to' have left this--this-"- as he spoke he pulled forth the will. "Eh.! what is this? Gracious providence! see--look here, Col- lins-this-this has saved my life, as it has my honor." Collins and Sanford gazed in astonisbment, for there was the mark of the ball, which had struck the parchment, and glanced off, and thus struck a less mortal part . "' Sanford, my son--you are now my son, for my daughter loves you -take the parchment, place it on yonder fire-let me see it burn and crisp-watch its every letter, and see that not a particle, nay, not even the ashes, remain to rise up in judgment against me." Sanford: obeyed, The blaze of a hickory fire soon destroyed the document, and as Clayton stretched out his hands, they were clasped by  Collins and Sanford, in a m-anner fully denoting the sincerity of the grasp- they gave in return.

On the trampled rights of man, And a moral era woke, Brightest since the world began." How rapidly time passes -quickly with the aged, pleasing and pro- gressive with the young. Months have elapsed since the events recorded in our last chapter transpired; events of a startling nature had occurred, and the eyes of- all were fixed upon one spot, and on certain men. The State House was looked upon as the scene wherein the characters of the great drama were to meet, and the startling incidents contained in it, carried out on the stage of life. There are associations of an equally interesting character connected with old Carpenter's Hall, situated in Carpenter's Court. It stands at the head of the court, and is now used by Charles Wolbert,. Esq., as an auction store. It was here the ground-work of our independence was laid; for here it was that, on the 4th of September, 1774, after an attempt on the part of the "mother country" to tax the colonies with- out their consent, the sages of America came together to consider of their grievances. Yes! those walls have echoed the inspiring eloquence of Patrick Henry, "the greatest orator," in'the opinion of Jefferson, t' that ever lived;" the very man who "gave the first impulse to the ball of the Revolution." He was the first. man that gave utterance to the words "Declaration of Independence,'; and the first to predict the separation of the colonies from the mother country, long before others dared to think of it. To these buildings all eyes were turned, and even at that period there were certain associations connected with both, which rendered them sa- cred in the eyes of the nation. Months had passed; winter, with its storms and tempests, had yielded to the soft, balmy months of spring; and yet, although nature was in her gayest garb, clothed with all the riches from her bounteous Giver- decked with gems of costly price-still there was misery and wretched- ness abroad in the land. Our readers are prepared to learn that a people so oppressed, trodden ,down, and crushed as it were beneath the iron rule of monarchy, were now about to assert their freedom, and give to the world the assurance ,of their being men. ..                  . , From that little hall there came forth a voice sounding'like a silver bell in the darkness and the mists which encompassed a nation. It awoke the spirit which dispelled the gloom, and a mightier voice and a mightier bell sent it forth to the world. It was in that building, on the 7th of June, 1776, that a resolution was offered for the action of Congress, to the effect of a separation from the mother counitry, by Richard- Henry Lee, and seconded by John Adams. The resolution was referred to a committee, who reported it an the following terms:  .   23           THE TINKER SPY. "nResolved, That these United States are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; and that all political connection between  them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved." This resolution was referred to a Committee of the Whole, by whom it was debated on Saturday the 8th, arid on Monday the 10th of June. t  In consequence of several of the States not having matured measures to enter into the spirit which animated the, others, the debate was ad- journed to the first of July, when it was resumed. In the meantime, a committee was appointed and instructed to prepare a declaration in acdordance with the object of the resolution. These were the prepara- thryrsteps taken for the production of that wondrous paper which has made us a nation. It was on: a clear, sultry evening in the month of June, that five men were seated around a table, in a room of a house which is rendered remarkable from the political associations surrounding it. The meeting of these five men together on that occasion, in so retired a place, had something connected-with it which involved a mighty question. Cau- tion and reserve marked their proceedings. The shutters of the win- dows were nearly closed; a white curtain, carefully secured at the bottom, kept out what little air was stirring, and broke the sound of their voices. These were five remarkable men; remarkable from the fact that each of them had taken part, and were now actively engaged, in the cause of independence. The object of their assembling on this occasion, will be explained as we proceed. The stoutest of the five, and the eldest, approached, the door, opening into an entry, and, giving three taps, it was instantly answered by some one who had been placed there as a guard. "Peter, be cautious;- remember that no one, under any circumstan- ces, is permitted to disturb us this night. Watch if any listeners are about, and, upon the least alarm, give three taps. Remember." - ." Rely, sir, on my caution." "I will, Peter."' Our readers in then speaker will recognize Benjamin Franklin. His companions were Thomas Jefferson, Roger Sherman, John Adams, and R. R. Livingston. These composed the committee to draft the DEC- LARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. Let us, for a moment, step from this room into another one in the same building. Mrs. Clymer, the landlady, had lighted the lamps, and giving a somewhat significant glance at the three gentlemen who were seated around the table, left the room. Mrs. Clymer was a character. Her house was the resort of the great men of the day. Thomas Jefferson was a boarder, and she occasionally had no less than six of the members of the old Congress at her house 'at one time. Identified both by interest and inclination with the Amer- ican party, her predilections naturally leaned that way, and-it was not to be wondered at that, when she saw those Englishmen, one an officer high in rank, and the other two having important political positions un- der the British government, holding as it were a caucus in her house-? although they were boarders--her colonial blood was " in arms," and, if not in reality "eager for the fray," at least her curiosity was so much   THE TINKER SPY.            73 excited that, had it not been for the innate delicacy of her nature, she would have listened at the door. As regarded the five gentlemen in the other room, she had not the least desire to know, inasmuch- as it was a constant habit of Thomas Jefferson to have company. And yet, she well- knew, from the extreme caution used-the closing of the outer shutters, and the stationing of Peter at the door-that something more than usual was going- on, even in that chamber. We must, however, leave Mrs. Clymer, for a while, and return to one of the chambers. "And do you say, Major, that Colonel Clayton has resigned ." "I do; and, what is more, he refuses to take part in the business I spoke about." "You astonish me!" "Nay, it is not so much a matter of astonishment, for there are fam- ily reasons; an old story of wrongs, and crime, and all that sort of thing, connected with which is that desperate Collins. That fellow has more influence in the city than any other man. He has the rabble with him, and knows how to govern them. I tell you, gentlemen, we are in a precarious situation. The Continental Congress plotting treason, agi- tators mn the street, and with such men as Payne with the quill, and Franklin with his sarcasm, the thing is assuming a somewhat alarming appearance." "Well, what do you propose?" "That you, Morrison, start to-morrow for New York; place these papers in the hands of Lord Howe; inform him that the question of separation from the mother country is now being discussed in this very city, and Ea committee is even now appointed to draft a sort of declara- tion; and-closer, gentlemen-that very committee meets this night, in this very house." "Is it possible?" was the exclamation of both his listeners. "Aye: and it is composed of the mind and the intellect of the nation. Now, gentlemen, the moment that document is passed, the war of ex- termination commences. We have been fighting so far for peace; we will now fight for war."     - "Then it is to lay all these facts and papers before the commander-in- chief, that I must away in the morning?  "It is. In the vneantime, let no word denote that we are aware of the secret meeting in this house. I have the names of the five who compose the committee, and their necks are already in the halter; it only wants the pulling." His two companions laughed at the idea of those five grave men secretly debating the question of liberty and independence, with a rope already twisted for their precious necks. Indeed it was a subject for English mirth; but, like all jokes, the fun is not always on one side." This little party having concocted their business, now settled them- selves to their wine, in which jovial situation we will leave them, and turn our attention to the room of the five doomed statesmen. "Mr. Livingston," said Jefferson, -" as you possess more legal knowl- edge, probably, than the rest of us united, will you let us have your views on the subject upon which we have met?" 'In this momentous question, Mr. Jefferson, it is not mere legal 5  7:4           THE TINKER SPY. -knowledge that is required, and I confess that I have done very little, beyond preparing a few simple notes, as I relied upon your great states- :man-like qualities, as well as those of Mr. Franklin, Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Adams." "Then it seems," remarked Sherman, " that Mr. Jefferson's notes are to be the basis upon which we are to form the instrument." "I understand," remarked Adams, " that Mr. Franklin has a written one." "Mine," replied Franklin, will be thrown into the common stock, as I look upon it as merely a series of notes. As Mr. Jefferson has written a declaration, I move it be read." "I have no objection to read mine entire, but in doing so, I must confess that to my friend Franklin I am indebted for much of the spirit which I think animates it." "Nay, Mr. Jefferson, that can scarcely be, inasmuch as I have not as yet"- "It is so, however, my friend, and before I read my rough draft, permit me to recite a passage from a recent article written by yourself L Now, listen, gentlemen. "' Security to the person and property of the governed is so evidently the design and end of civil government, that to attempt a logical de- monstration of it, would be like burning a taper, at noonday, to assist the sun in enlightening the world. It cannot be either valorous or honorable to attempt to sustain an institution of which this is not the :great and principal basis.'  Do you remember this passage, Mr. Franklin ."    - "I must confess I do." "Well, I will recite one more; it is from a speech you recently made."    . .  ..     -.- .  . , " Well, sirs, I ask if he has not done all this, nay, more I Let the smouldering ruins of cities sacked and burned, speak for us. Let the martyrs rise up and speak for us. Let the oppressed, the heart-broken, and the noble spirits of the land, speak for us.' "Now, gentlemen, my object in quoting these lines, is to show you that I have, in this instrument, used your own words in some portions of it, and our friend Sherman, here, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Livingston, will also observe, having been free with their sentiments before I read / it, how much more essential it will be for us all to compare notes after- wards, and make up a paper which, it is to be hoped, will carry with it, down through all ages, the seeds for the growth of future republics." The motion being made that Mr. Jefferson should read his draft, their chairs were drawn close together, and then, for the first time to listen- ing ears, was the Declaration of Independence read. Word with word was weighed; sentence after sentence swallowed with avidity; and when it was concluded, a silence for a few seconds prevailed. Instantly the hands of the reader were seized; each man started to his feet, and expressive silence spoke a language which true men alone understand. Franklin deliberately walked up to the fire-place, and as deliberately pulling out a roll of paper, he placed- it across the branches of an old- fashioned pair of andirons; seizing a lighted candle, he applied it to the   THE TINKER SPY.            75 paper.  The flame separated its folds; it opened; it crackled and sparkled. In vain Jefferson cried " hold!" in vain he essayed to op- pose the rest; ohe by one did Adams, Sherman and Livingston walk up to the blaze, and offer their testimony to the sublimity and grandeur of Jefferson's paper, in this, the destruction of their own, as a sacrifice. Sherman spoke first:- "The work is accomplished.   That paper will be adopted, and the land will proclaim its sentiments from one extreme end to the other." Again was that paper read. Several passages were marked, two of which, our readers will remember, were cut out before all had signed it. One of these read thus: "He has excited treasonable insurrections of our fellow citizens, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of our property." The other was a lengthy clause, from which, however, we give the annexed extract: '"This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the war- fare of the Christian king of Great Britain. These two clauses, with the exception of a few words, were all the alterations made in the first draft of that immortal document; and when those five men--men whose names are linked to its production by ada- mantine chains-when, we say, those five men parted on that night, tears were streaming down their cheeks-tears of love, of friendship, and of hope. They parted, on that night, to meet on the Fourth of July, 1776; that paper was then to bepresented in general Congress assem- bled, and the fate of a nation decided. CHAPTER XVII. "The motto of our father band Circled the world in its embrace; 'T was ' Liberty throughout the land,' And good to all their brother race." We have frequently wondered why some historian, well versed in the annals of our Revolutionary war, never attempted a description, of those scenes and events which preceded and followed the Declaration of In- dependence. What a subject--a subject fraught with an interest which few of our readers, at this late day, are acquaited with. In our story we have simply alluded to a few startling features, leaving it for a more talented pen to embody, and give a more truthful and interesting pic- ture to the world. While the subject of the Declaration was being discussed within the walls of the old State House, scenes of an equally exciting nature were transpiring without. Business of all kinds was suspended, stores were closed and crowds of excited citizens congregated in and around the old State House, andl .           'I\   THE TINKER SPY. , engaged in eager discussion. Indeed, there was some apprehension ,f an outhreak among the people, as there were those who talked boldly and loudly of treason, and hinted at making an attack upon the building At that period there were but few houses fronting on Chestnut street, between Fifth and Sixth. Indeed there were but'two; one was P. S. Duponceau's, situated on the side now occupied by, a splendid -row of stores, known as Hart's Building. The other was called the State House Inn  This stood i, the vast area, now a compact mass of brick and mortar. The inn in question was a small two-story building, of rough- dashed construction, very old, even at-that period, being marked with thea year 1693, as its birth year. It stood back a little from the line -of the street, and the. front space, instead of presenting to' the eye a green court-yard, was filled with oyster shells. An 'old citizen, speaking of this building and its Jocality, says --- That single and dimiinutive inn, for a long time, gave all the entertainment then taken by the court suitors, or by those who hung about the Colonial Assemblies and the. primitive Congress. But, desolate as it looked in: front and rear, having a waste lot of commons instead of garden shrubbery, and the neighboring lots equal- ly open and cheerless, there was a redeeming appendage in, a range of lofty and primitive walnut trees, which served as distant pointers to guide, the stranger to the venerable State House, itself beyond the verge of common civilization" It is in front of thisinn we now call the-attention of our readers. Sev- eral men whose appearance bespoke them of English birth, and whose conversationr fully con oed it, stood on the shell courtyard of the inn. "There," exclaimed one, "do you see that man standing like a statue in yonder belfry? Behold him, looking as proud as Lucifer, and just as likely to fall, like the arch fiend, from his hight. And then look yonder -there, beyond that low building; do you see that young girl, with a wreath and white flag? Do you understand all thist" "Aye," exclaimed his companions, in one voice; "and yet," continued one of the speakers, "what a glorious failure it will be." Nay, I do not agree with you. The document will be received, but the object will fail. Benjamin Franklin, that old traitor--" Scarcely had these words escaped the lips of the speaker, when he was struck, and fell heavily to the ground, and over his prostrate body Peter sprang, like a youthful tiger, and commenced an attack upon the whole party. Poor indeed would have been his chance of escaping with life, if at that moment two other men had not stepped forward and guard- ed him, while one of them, in a bold, determined voice, bade the cora- batants stand back. "Who are you, sir?" fiercely demanded one of the Englishmen. "A man, sir-and the friend of man. Breathe another word against the unsullied character of Franklin, or insult the meanest individual en- gaged in this great struggle for freedom, and I will chastise you-aye, sir, like'a dog. Nay, no bullying; I am not a man to be deterred from my purpose." Our readers, in the speaker, will recognize Collins ; his companion was Sanford The better part of valor is discretion; so thought the    THE TINKER SPY.            7  blustering foes to the rights of the people, and they consequeitly retired into the inn. "Ah  1 Mr. Collins, you are always in tim e," exclaimed Peter. "Aye, Peter," observed Sanford; "but you cannot always expectso timely an interference. "This spirit, Sanford," said Collins, "on the part of those scoundrels who hang around the skirts of monarchy must be put down, and I am determined to follow Peter's example, and strike the blow the instant I hear an expression of it. Let us be the champions of the spirit which animates every one in that council chamber. Soon it will embody itself with the people, and become a living thing." li "Hold up your hands, Sammy," exclaimed a  female voice; "higher; now pray, boy; pray that we may this day be able to shout ' down with all kingly rule!'" That boy did raise his hands; thathodidpray and thathoy lived to fill a high and important position in the political world, under the administration of James Monroe, fifth President of the United States. On the steps of Duponceau's house, there were a number of ladies, well dressed in the fashion of the time. Their anxious looks, like those of the surrounding multitude, were bent upon one point of attraction- the old State House.              full of youngte The aged trees which surround the building, were full of youngsters They scarcely knew the nature of that meeting; but, catching the glance from a thousand upraised eyes, their voung hearts whispered in each quick pulsation caused by the exit ent of th e scene, "'tis for freedom." Far down Sixth street, towa  ld Potter's Field, now Washington Square, crowds lined the pavement, w hile from tihe fews scattering houses, ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and their actions were responded to by the shouts of the young gallants in the street. Indeed, the whole scene was a glowing one, and te occasional deep silence which pervaded, was in itself audible. For a moment, and only for a moment, let us step into that council chamber. , That scene has been frequen tly described Trumbull ha' imorta izad it and himself, in his great picture of that eventful day's work Abler pens than ours have described it-but the closing portion of it we give here. Word by word, they had calmly and dispassionately read and debated the great question. Fear sat upon the brow of many. "That instru- ment, says a contemporary writer, tithey saw, cut them off even 'from the mercy of Great Britain." They saw with prophetic vision all the horrors. of a sanguinary war- carnage and desolation passed m swift review before them. They saw '.the prospect of having riveted still more closely upon their already chafed and bleedinglimbs, the h of slavery. The House seemed to waver-ience, deep and solemn silence, reigned through the hall of the spacious Capitol. Every countenance indicated that deep meditation was at work; and the solemn resolutions were calling for double energy. At this fearful crisis, when the very destiny of the county seemed to be suspended upon the action of a moment, the s'dence, the painful silence, was   THE TINKER SPY.  broken. An aged patriarch arose-a venerable and stately form-his head white with the frosts of many years. He cast on the assembly a look of inexpressible interest and unconquerable determination; while on his visage his hue of age was lost at the burning patriotism that fired his cheek. "There is," said he, "a tide -in the affairs of men-a nick of time. We perceive it now before us. That noble instrument upon your table should be inscribed this very morning, by every pen in the House. He who will not respond to its accents, and strain every nerve to carry into effect its provisions, is unworthy the name of a freeman. Although these gray hairs mwt descend into the sepulchre, I would infinitely rather they should descend thither by the hand of the public execu- tioner, than desert at this crisis the sacred cause of my country." "Hark!" exclaimed Franklin, during one of those solemn pauses which occurred during the discussion of the passage of the Declaration. "Hark! the populace shout, and then comes the fearful silence which precedes a doubt. Gentlemen, if we leave these walls without accom- plishing our great mission, the people will rise in their might, and anticipate our more deliberate operations. I, for one say, let us sign i' "We must be unanimous," were the dignified words of Jkhn Han- cock; "we must all hang together in this business." "We will sign," was the unanimous cry. As John Hancock wrote his name, which, as the reader knows, was written in a large, bold hand, he observed: "There! John Bullea read my name without spectacles, and may now double his rewai  500 for my head. That is my defiance." And so it was of all, as they placed their sign manual to that instru- ment. Loud were the cries outside. No signal had yet been given that the "deed was done." Two o'clock-all was silent-the man in the belfry had as yet never moved-his hand held the hammer-ready-ready he had been since morning-not a morsel of food had he tasted-he would not have moved from that spot for the wealth of a nation-he awaited the signal-the crowd became impatient-the women ceased waving their handkerchiefs-the boys still clung to the branches of the trees, and the maiden with the white flag became pale under excitement.- Hark! what is that-a man is seen ascending the few steps leading to the belfry-all eyes are turned in that direction-respiration for a mo- ment ceases--the bellman makes a motion--a voice exclaims in thunder tones, "It is passed!" One blow on the bell, and new life animates the crowd. From lip to lip-from street to street-from town to country- away-away--the words go, like the waves of the ocean, reverberating like the roar of the wind, as they undulated along and through all space. The city of Philadelphia, on the afternoon of the Fourth of July, 1776, presented to the view, a city convulsed. Joy yielded awhile to patriotism, and the word Freedom became the watchword. A writer says:-"When the news reached New York, the bells were set ringing, and the excited multitude surging hither and thither, at length gathered around the Bowling Green, and seizing the leaden eques- trian statue of George III., which stood there, tore it into fragments.    79 THE TINKER SPY. troops When the Declaration arived in Boston  e people ga in old Fanueil Hall to hear it read,. and as the last sentence fell from the lips of the reader, a loud shout went up, and soon from every fortified height and every battery, the thunder of cannon re-echoed the joy" CHAPTER XVIIIll.

COLLY 1IBBEER Our fair readers, no doubt, imagine that Laura and Sanford are al- ready married and settled, and that Jane and Collins have quietly settled the case. Laura is with her father-Jane her attendant. For the pres- ent we must leave the domestic circle, and continue our story in con- nection with the stirring events of the day. The attention of our readers is now called to a place rendered import- ant, both as regards its being near the site of mii..m Penr.'s landing, and with which many associations are connecte a nhighly interesting character. We allude to the Draobridge. As early as 1682, the first settlers landed their goo/ds at the low, sandy beach, upon which was erected the Blue Anch, or Tavern, on the. north side of thedock, thus giving to this portion of our city ad interest, arising from the fact that it was the starting point, and there an embryo city was formed. During the revolution an old Brew-house stood north of the Draw- bridmge, on Front street, originall owned by Anthony Morris, arid at the period of which we are speaking, was known as "Morris' Brew-house. To this place, on the evening of July 6th, 1776, we now convey our readers Around a long table, stood some twenty men, and in the back- ground, double the number, of what were termed "Town Boys." These. were mechanics and, apprentices, hard-fisted, desperate fellows, ready for any outhreak, the plans of which were generally suggested by older and more experienced persons. On this occasion they were called together: for an especal purpose-it was one which involved the safety of no less; a person than our old friend Peter Morris. The organization of anything like a miltarv rule was not established. The declaration of independence had startled the whole British force in America, and even the Ameri- cans themselves remained, at least in cities under British rule, some- what neutral. But our readers are fully aware, that there were two men, at least, who were not likely to remain in that position, under any circum- stances, more particularly when the safety of a friend, and that friend Peter Morris, was at stake.   The facts connected with Peters incarceration in one of the .prisons connected with the- British barracks, were Simply these: The Enlish- manb'e struck on the afternoon of the 4th of July, was. one connected With an difficence of a detachment of British soldiers, whose head-quarters were at the old barracks, in the Northern Liberties. He was a man not likely to overlook an insult, independent of a blow. For that purpose, he made up a story to his military relation, which- induced that gentle  man to issue orders for the arrest of the offender-, Benjamin Franklin shortly after the signing of the Declaration, had privately left the city, as was supposd for the purpose of consulting Washington uon the fu ture operations of the members of Congress, in relation to th ua and maintaining of the war, which was now began in earnest. Peter, therefore, had no powerful- friend at court; and even if he had, so sud- den was his arrest, that he scarcely had time to whisper a word to the housekeeper. That word was conveyed to Collins, and hence the object of the meeting of "The Boys," at the old Brew-house. At the head of the table stood Collins; beside him, Sanford. The deep tones of the voice of the former sounded mournfully in that gloomy chamiber.. :He was ivin "b"om y ,  er       :^. ,e wasgiving it the boy" an account of the arrest of Peters the cause, the place of his imprisonment, and the high ha-ded act of the rotary, in seizing him in the open street. At the conclusion, there was but one expression, and that was-"S-To the Rescue,'" - Ayers exclaimed Collins; "and I offer myself as your leader." A loud huiza followed; and having planned and arranged their mode of procedure, they seP arated to meet infront of the barracks, at eleven o'clock that night. v- At that period, the ground-plot of the barracks extended from Sec- ond to Third, and from Tammany to Green streets, having oficers quar- th Liers, and other buildings. Part Of these buildings still remain, and the NortheraLiberties Town Hall formed a portion of the main buildinge at that time, in front of which, on the -evening of the 6th of Jul, 1776 there as coected, what in those days were called mobs. Indeed, riots at that period were frequent, but at such a time and place, an assemblage of citizens was calculated to create an alarm, par- ticulafiy as it seemed to brave the nilitary itself The officer who commanded the barracks, was one already alluded to in this legend. Our readers will recognize in him the Corporal spoken f in'our first chapter. Seeing a crowd at the main entrance, le stepped forward, and demanded what they wanted. Collinsstated tecause of their assembling was to demand the liberation of Peter Morrs, who was, contrary to all law, civil, as well as militay, held a prisoner. To this request the commandant in whose mind a most brilliant idea entered at that moment, replied that if Collins would step into the barracks, the matter could be arranged without the necessity of resorting to means of force. To this (ollins consented, not for a moment dreaming that trieachers was the intention of the offieer; and hang exehangea few words with Sanford, entered the barracks with the offcer. The moment the door was closed, it struck Sanford that treachery was intended  In an instant he communicated with the men, and hav- ing divided them into three'parties, to the leaders of the two he gave   THE TINKER SPY.           81 such directions as were calculated to protect Collins, and themselves. What an effect such an arrangement had, will soon be made known. Collins was conducted into a large room, from the ceiling of which was suspended a huge iron lamp. It cast around a feeble light, but sufficient for Collins to recognize in the commandant, which he had not noticed before, his old enemy, the Corporal. The exclamation, "Ah!" escaped him. "You know me, do you? 'Tis well. Now, Mr. Tinker, I think I have you in my power. What ho! there. Now, sir, you shall see how I will disperse this mob. Captain Wilson," addressing an officer who that moment entered, " call up all the men from the block house, bring them in front-place a portion ofthem in the second story, the balance in the lower room, fronting on Third street. Send Carpenter here, and bid him bring the,handcuffs. Away, sir. Ha! ha! Mr. Tinker, who is the conqueror now?" "I am," was the calm reply of Collins.  l "You base traitor, I have had my eyes upon you from the first time we met, and know, sir, that I have here an especial warrant for your arrest." "Well, sir, why do you not arrest me?" "You are arrested!!" "No, sir!"-and before the commandant was aware of his intention, Collins had secured the door; and putting the key in his pocket, calmly replied--"You are in error, sir; when we last conferred together, I stated that when next we met, I should be prepared; sir, you are in my power." "Ho I there." "Silence! One word and you are a dead man." "Would you murder me?" "No! but If demand of you to stand there where you are, while I speak to my men, from this window." Collins moved toward the window; he had partly raised the sash, when he felt a sharp stinging pain. Turning suddenly around he stood face to face with the commandant, whose sword was streaming with blood. "Villain! I do not know the extent of the wound-" The cowardly villain made towards the back window. Collins, with a quick but firm hand, drew a pistol from an inside pocket-coolly cocked it-made a step forward-took deliberate aim, and fired. One scream -the form of a man springing some feet into the air, and then falling heavily on the floor, told the sad effect of that shot. The blood and brains of the treacherous officer were scattered around. The report of the pistol was heard by the man who had been sent for the handcuffs; he hurried towards the door, and finding it locked, he immediately gave the alarm. Collins, hearing the noise, rushed to where the dead body of the commandant lay, and seizing the sword, yet wet with his own blood, he prepared to defend his life to the last. Presently be heard them at the door-he flew to the window--shouted through the bars, to the rescue, and had just time to place himself against the wall, and meet the upraised weapons of four soldiers.   ^82   -THE TINKER SPY.          . Collins was not a man to lose either his courage or presence of mind, both of which were now essential to his preservation. He warded off a blow aimed at his head, and returned it by inflicting a serious wound on the body of him who gave it. During all the time he felt the wound in his left arm, inflicted by the commandant, the extent of which he scarcely knew. Yet did he contend bravely against the three who were now pressing upon him. He succeeded in wounding another, and the clash- mg of swords sounded fearfully in that room. But the strife now became more general-then came a rush and struggle through the long corri- dor-shouts and screams, the falling of bodies and the shouts of the vic- tor. Collins was joined by a man sho rushed wildly on, with a club in- his hand, instead of a sword. In a moment he felled one of the men to, the earth; the others retreating, fell back- into the corridor, and joined the British soldiery, who were now driven into the interior of the build- ing by the mob. The sound of fire-arms, the blows from clubs, denoted a deadly strife. ButCollins' appearance soon changed the state of af- fairs. The retreating soldiers had now reached the extent of the-bar- rack's gardens. Here they rallied; their officers bid them stand; and the re-loading of their muskets seemed as a prelude to another scene of blood. Collins also arranged his men; pistols were drawn, when at that moment Sanford sprung from the back wall, followed by some fifty of the "Towi Boys," and in an instant the soldiers were firmly grasped in the powerful arms of the hardy sons of the soil. The man who ren- dered Collins such effectual service in the main room, now approached, and throwing back his streaming hair, and wiping the smoke and gun- powder from his face, displayed to the astonished sight of Collins, Peter. Morris.  - "Ah! my lad, it is to you I owe my life." "Ah, Mr. Collins, the debt is not paid yet, but I am free now, and from this moment I am a soldier of Washington."  Loud shouts re-echoed the sentiment, and it was there a company of Frave hearts was organized, whose deeds spoke for them at the battle of Princeton. The old barracks, from that night's struggle, were no longer in pos- session of the British; the city became Americanized, and changed for a time, only when a greater force compelled the citizens to submit to the iron rule of foreign troops under Lord Howe. In other places, and m other scenes, the sword was doing its work for freedom.    THE TINKER SPY.            83 CHAPTER XIX. Of blood to crowds begets the thirst for more, As-the first wine cup leads to the long revel.-BYRON. We now convey our readers into an elegant apartment in the dwelling of Colonel Clayton. 'The stern military loo1k has yielded to a more placid and parental one, for his eyes are fixed upon his lovely child, and a smile plays around a mouth which was wont to be wreathed with curling scorn. It was not so now. A ehange had come over his dream of life, and he awoke to see things in a new light. The most remarkable of these was the change in his political sentiments. The high-toned Colonel of the British army-the man who had bowed to sovereignty, even to the car- rying out of its tyrant laws--now spoke of oppressive acts on the palrt of his king. He reasoned--reflected; and, after the passing of the Declaration, on the Fourth of july, 1776, his whole nature changed, and he threw up his commission, and took no further part in the affairs of his government. Such was Colonel Clayton at the commencement of this chapter. It was on the evening of the sixth of July, that the Colonel and his daughter were seated at a table, on which were numerous books, charts, &c. "Then you think, my child, that there is something going on to-night." "I fear there is, father. Sanford received a note which seemed to excite him much, and when I questioned him, he evidently avoided the subject. And then, you know, Peter Morris has been taken up and imprisoned." These are sad and' fearful times, my child, and would that I could see you wedded before the events which I fear will arise out of this bold ,paper, occur. But this cannot be; you must, therefore, await the result. Sanford's commission, no doubt, will be forwarded from the War De- partment, and then he must leave us. General Howe has taken pos- session of Staten Island; Admiral Howe, his brother, has arrived, and, joining his forces with those of Clinton, places under the command of General Howe twenty-four thousand men. Their object, as I under; stand, and I will not disguise it, my child, I purpose to use to favor the cause of the colonies." "You, father . " '"Aye; but understand me; this information is derived from other sources than governmental ones. In feet, my child-to be candid-since I have read that document, the Declaration of Independence, my opin- ions have materially changed." "Indeed, my dear father; that makes me so happy." "Well, as I was observing, it is the design of the British to seize New York, and keep possession of the Hudson river. See, here is the map. This will open a communication with Canada, separate the Eastern from  84           THE TFIicSsK SPY. the Middle States, and, as you will perceive, they can command all the adjacent country. It is, however, said that General Washington has some twenty-seven thousand men, but many of them are invalids, undisciplined troops, and unprovided with fire-arms." "True, dear father; and yet, amid all their sufferings, and every pri- vation, these brave men have, so far, maintained an almost equal fight with the British troops. Andyet, dear father, much as I love Sanford, I will forego his company-postpone our marriage-rather than his patriotism should pale the brightness of his love. Country first, love second, will be my maxim, and it will nerve me to bear his absence: but, oh'! if he should fall." "Trust to heaven, my dhild. Wre are but mortals, and death comes among us in all forms, and .at all times. Hark! what noise is that " Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, before Jane rushed in, with terror depicted in her looks, and presenting the very picture of fright. "Well, Jane," exclaimed the Colonel, (" what is the matter?" "Oh, sir, they are coming-we shall all be murdered!" "Who are coming 8 " "The citizens; they have risen and taken the barracks; they are go- ing to burn down the town, kill everybody, and murder all the women! Oh, dear! what shall we do?" "'Be silent, Jane; your terrors have crazed you. Hark! they ap- proach." The Colonel went to the window and looked out The sight that presented itself was, indeed, calculated to create some alarm, for imme- diately in front of his dwelling a vast crowd had assembled, many of those composing it being armed; others carried heavy clubs, others ban- ners, and a crowd of boys followed with flambeaux, which threw a glare of light over the scene, rendering it one of a fearful character to gaze upon. The Colonel's figure at the window was immediately recognized, and, as it was generally known throughout the .city that he rather favored the Americans, they gave three cheers, to which he answered by a wave of the hand, denoting a response to their greeting. "Colonel," exclaimed a voice from the crowd, which made Laura start, "Collins is wounded, and having fainted from the loss of blood, I have brought him here." Now there came a scream, and the next moment Jane was down the stairs and into the street. "If I take Mr. Collins into my house," observed the Colonel, "havifing been wounded in opposing the king's troops, I make myself at once a party to his acts. I would have you understand that." "We know it-we know it" "Then, as you know it, let all the world know it, that Colonel Clay- ton's house is open to the sick and wounded of all -parties, in this great struggle.-- Friend or foe, ill or wounded, be he English or American, can command his house, his purse or his services. I cannot fight for you, but I will not fight against you. My sword, drawn in the cause of George the Third, is sheathed forever."   THE TINKER SPY.            85 Loud shouts rent the air. The door was opened for the wounded man. Jane was at his side, as was also her brother Peter; and when he was taken into a room hastily prepared for him, he had so far revived as to thank those around him, and press the hand of Jane, whose tears were flowing in abundance. - For awhile we leave them with the wounded man, who, from loss of blood, had -fainted immediately after leaving the barracks. The interview between Laura and her lover--the long conference with her father, with other matters appertaining to the future-will be de- tailed in the further -progress of the story. The attack on the barracks by the mob, created great excitement throughout the city, and a far more fearful one was to be apprehended, for it was observable in the actions of the people, and heard in the whis- perings as well as louder threats, made even -in the hearing of the au- thorities. Prompt action, however, on the part of the military and civil powers, in which all parties united to preserve order, prevented any outhreak. In consequence of the war, the corporation of -the-city was dissolved in 1776, and remained unincorporated until 1789, thus virtually surrendering the city into the hands of her foes, while Samuel Powel, the acting Mayor in the early part of the year 1776, resumed his duties in 1785. What tended to keep alive the ill feeling existing between the soldiery and the people, was the spirit of the royal press sustained at that time in this city. "The True Royal Gazette," published by James Humph- reys, jr., a tory-and there were many such tories, whose names are as familiar with us as household words, and whose heirs not unfrequently boast of the deeds of their sires in the days of our Revolution. Were we to name them, the community would be startled, inasmuch as history has so far lent itself to bury the crimes of these men, that the epithet of tory has been, by the magic of the pen, changed to the title of pa- triot. Humphreys, however, gloried in his toryism, and his paper was filled with the sickly dishes which are so apt to tickle the palates of -the subjects of royalty. On the morning after the riot, this tory paper spoke of it in terms of bitter hatred. The words "rebel hounds," "rebel transactions," and similar expressions, were freely used, and fully carried out the popular song published in its columns, containing such words as these: "Rebel hills and rebel dales, by rebel bands surrounded." A few years afterwards, the character of newspaper poetry was ma- terially changed, by a native poet; one whose name is linked with our great national song, "Hail Columbia," and the equally popular one, at that period, entitled the "Battle of the Kegs." We now, in our capacity of magician, which not unfrequently forms a part of a writer's peculiar study, pass over many months, and bring our readers, on the wings of time, to other scenes and other places. To effect this, and give it something of a dramatic character, we drop the curtain, and announce a lapse of five months between the close of this chapter and the opening of the next.   86           THE TINKER SPY. CHAPTER XX "The night descends, With her black wings to brood o'er all the world."-LEE. The prospects of the American arms looked rather unfavorable. The. surprise of Lee, who commanded the forces stationed on the Hudson, on the 13th December, 1776, and the removal of his forces, under the command of General Sullivan, to join Washington's main body in Penn- sylvania, were among the causes which tended to throw a gloom over the state of affairs. Washington, with but a handful of men, had to oppose a victorious army, made up of the veteran troops of Europe. The greatest force that Washington could command at this period was about seven thousand men, while that of the enemy numbered upwards of forty thousand. It seems to us, while pondering over the extraordinary scenes which marked our Revolutionary struggle, that the mere power of man could never have accomplished what resulted in the overthrow of the British army. An old and eccentric historian, writing upon this subject, says: -"Jehovah, the God of Hosts, was with him'; and oft times, in the ear-of the slumbering hero, his voice was heard,--' fear not, for I am with thee be not dismayed, for I am thy God.'" That Washington seemed as one protected by some mysterious power, we have many strange and remarkable facts in corroboration. Hearing his officers one day talking about the gloominess of the Ameri- can affairs, and the charge as it were of treason hanging over their heads, he humorously clasped his neck with his hands, and said, with a smile, "I really cannot believe, yet, that my neck was ever made for a halter." During the summer and fall of 1776, Washington did nothing but retreat. He was compelled to do this, or see his little army liter- ally cut to pieces. The Hessian soldiers were a sort of train bands; a wretched class of men, whose ignorance and brutality were the marked features of their mode of conducting themselves. The British, to ren- der them still more savage, made them believe that the- Americans were not Christians, but barbarians, and were in the habit of eating their prisoners: in short, that they were a race of cannibals. This created on their part a most determined hatred of the Americans, in- spiring them with the utmost abhorrence, which they manifested on every occasion, by committing all kinds of outrages. They burned houses, destroyed furniture, killed the stock, outraged female innocence, and spread ruin and consternation around. To save their families from such horrid tragedies, the Americans flocked in by thousands to General Howe, to take the oath of allegiance. Such was the alarming state of affairs towards the close of the year 1776. Washington and his little army had retreated from  Long Island to New York; from New York, over the Hudson, to New Jer- sey, and now over the Delaware to Pennsylvania. The same old his- torian, already quoted, speaking for the brave General Reed, says: /   THE TINKER'SPY.            87 "'My God, General Washington, how long shall we retreat?' "'Why, sif replied Washington, 'if we can do no better, we'll retreat over every river in America, and last of all over the mountains, whence we shall never lack opportunities to annoy, and finally, I hope, to expel the enemies of our country.'" It was Christmas night; the air was chilled; the Delaware river was full of floating ice, and the whole scene, as far as the eye could reach, was one of dreariness and desolation. On the evening in question, three men stood on the borders of a small stream which empties into the river Delaware, a few miles above Trenton. They were wrapped in cloaks, beneath which the close observer might have discovered wea- pons of a very warlike character. The eldest of the three, and evi- dently their leader, having taken a glance across the river, remarked, that. they must proceed farther up. "All is still in the town," he remarked; " the dreadful state of the weather keeps them all within doors; and while the tempest is raging without-for see how the sleet and snow thicken upon our garments- they are rioting within. Hark! By heavens! look yonder, Sanford; do you see that flash a Ah! I see, the General will cross at McKonkey's Ferry. Come, boys, let- us on." The three men were Sanford, Collins, and Peter. "I tell you, Mr. Collins, you are leading us a goose chase. Here, at the risk of our necks, have we passed through Trenton, you giving the password, as if you were a British officer; then crossing the Delaware in a mere skiff. I1 tell you I don't like it; then there is Sis and Mr. Franklin, whom I have actually deserted. Now, only look at it!" "' Well, Peter," remarked Sanford, " you have forgotten one thing." C"What is that, Master Sanford?" "We have gained information of the utmost importance." 't What do you say to that, Peter?" observed Collins. t' Ah, Mr. Collins, you are a devil of a fellow; but what are we to gain by this 8 " "Liberty, boy!" "Yes, I know that; but here have we been fighting on our own hook, and while others get all the honors, we get all the kicks." "Ah! say you so? Now, Peter-and you, Sanford-as we .move on, let me impart something to each of you. We are this night en- gaged in a perilous piece of business. The American troops are on the Pennsylvania side; w'e are here, as it were, in the very midst of our foes, surrounded on all sides. If by any accident Washington cannot pass the river, we are lost; but listen-if we die, we do not fall as common soldiers, for I am a Colonel, and have been for the last twelve months." "Eh! you a Colonel?" "Aye-and you, Sanford, under Washington's own signature, bear, from yesterday, the rank of Captain. "Is this so, Collins?" "Aye, when daylight arrives, read." "And what am I  ." asked Peter. "A Sergeant. There is your commission. Now, lads, you see I   88           THE TINKER SPY. would not have undertaken this business if it were not that the eye of Washington is upon us, and we are now his commissioned officers, act- ing under orders. You are both my officers, will you obey-." "To the death!" "Well, we have now all the information to give our General. Col. Rahl is in full ball costume, in the midst of beauty and fashion; the men are nearly all drunk, and if the troops reach the shore by mid- night, the -town is ours. Ah! see yonder-the light glimmers along the water. See! torches flash their glare on the stream." "By heavens, Collins," exclaimed Sanford, "they are about em- barking!" "No, not-yet; there is a signal and telegraph yet to be given and an- swered---so, come along." At that lSeriod, as our readers may well imagine, there were but few dwellings beyond Trenton, along up the Delaware. Yet there were scattering .cottages,- inhabited by old settlers, many of them owners of vast tracts of land, who took no- part in the war, and were willing to take part'with the strongest party, so that; their lives and property might ultimately be secured. Col. Rahl, the corimandant of the forces at Trenton, had placed picket guards some short distance from the town, but on this night there seemed to be no order observed, or the regular caution exercised to prevent an attack.- Indeed, they had but little to apprehend-the Delaware river, filled with floating ice, divided them fromithe small American force; and even, if it had not, they con- sidered themselves fully enabled to maintain their position against any force that could be brought against them. Fatal error! , Small bands of Hessians were roving through the countiy, committing, as we before observed, all kinds of outrages, and compelling the people - to swear allegiance, which, not unfrequently, after' being complied with, they were grossly insulted and basely plundered. These scoundrels were the terror of the country people for miles around. But a day of reckoning was at hand; the tide of old time was swelling up the surges which were to engulf them; and the blood of martyrs, the screams of insulted women, the pitying cries of infancy for mercy, were all to be revenged; and the boiling and rolling of the mighty element was heard in the distance. Hark!-then comes a scream on the wings of the night-again, loud shouts, as if in mockery. "Silence," exclaimed Collins; " the Hessians have attacked some farmer's house-follow, boys-close-and in silence." /    THE TINKER SPY.           89 CHAPTER XXI. "The ball, unerring, found its mark.-WEEMS. "Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt."-MLTON. We now conduct our readers to the house from whence the sounds proceeded, as stated in our last chapter. It was one of those old-fash- ioned farm houses, built in the early stage of the history of New Jersey. It had the gable ends running up to a peak, not unlike the Cromwell style of hat. The construction was of stone, and the whole appearance of the building was one of strength, usefulness, and absence of all the rules of architecture. On the night in question, the old farmer, with his wife, a daughter of about eighteen years of age, and two boys, ranging gradually down, allowing about eighteen months between, with a man and maid servant, composed the household,  Being Christmas night, and a cold one at that, the wind whistling around the house, and sleet patting against the shutters, the old man had made up a cheerful fire; the table was drawn into the centre of the room, around which the whole family were as- sembled to enjoy, as the mother said, "Our annual Christmas feast." "Ah, boys, you are too big for the belief in Kris Kingle; yet, dears, let the remembrance of your earlier years still make this one of joy and happiness." "The times, too, my boys, are such that we can scarcely call an hour our own; yet are the associations of Christmas so strong, that even our danger ceases to give us trouble. There, Anne, help William to some of that cake.  Here, John," speaking to the laborer, "is a glass of wine -drink to better days." "Ah, sir, better days are far off, I am afraid-here is health to all." ' "But did not William-nay, Anne, blush not-say that he would be lh re to-night?" "He did, father-but--" "But-well--" - "He has gone over the river." "Over the river-what, ventured on the ice?" "Yes, father, I  saw him go, and, thank heaven, he reached the shore in safety." "What is the meaning of this?" e "I can explain," replied John. "Do so, for this is most strange." "Well, sir, sometime during the afternoon, William came running down from the hill, beyond the fencethere, and rushing into the house, came forth with a musket. Anne was with him; he unlocked his skiff, lumped- into it, and worked his way across the stream." "What for?" "Father, I will tell you. - From the height of the. hill, W illiam saw, 6   40    .       THE TINKER SPT. far in the distance, on the Pennsylvania side, a marching army; he re- cognized the staff of Washington, and he has joined him." "God bless the boy-God bless him--let us drink success to the American arms."  Every hand raised a glass; every lip tasted the wine; and every heart murmured a prayer. Silence reigned for an instant. Just as they were replacing their glasses upon the table, they heard the tread of many feet-a hum of voices-rattling of arms-and then the loud tone of a man, uttering ejaculations, which caused the inmates o2 that dwelling to tremble. The words--the Hessians are upon us-came trembling from every lip; and, alas! so it was, for the door was broken open, and eight stout, rough looking men, dressed in the uniform which' distinguished them from the British soldiers, and from all others, entered the room. "Good even, Meinherr. Ah, dis is good; dat is vat you call em on de English, nish." So spoke their leader, as he pushed the old man from his chair, and took his place at the table. .The rest, following his example, they soon had possession of the table and its. contents: In the meantime, the alarmed inmates gathered together in a corner, and gazed with horror on those night assassins. Their well known character, utter depravity and recklessness, and believing the worst told tales of the treatment of their prisoners, it was not strange that they should manifest so much alarm. This poor family had hoped to have escaped the insults and ra- pacity of- the Hessians, from the fact that they lived so remote from the scene of strife. But such was not to be the case. After drinking and eating,- heir leader fixed his eyes upon Anne, as she stood trembling in the corner. :"Ah, mein cot, what ish dis-one angel-you come here dat I may kiss you. Dunder and blitzen, why you no come-eh?" "Oh, sir, have mercy, do not harm us." "Harm, eh! goot-I love you, mein sweet, dat ish all." s The old man, fearful of some gross outrage, begged them to make free with all that was in the house, but as they were men, not to insult his poor wife and daughter. "Dat your frow, eh? Nish, goot, but dis ish mine frow for de night." ( No, Captain," exclaimed one, using better English, "I will take the girl-you have had your pick long enough." "Eh! you, dunder and blitzen, Meinherr Switzer; but I's cut your damn throat if I hears more of dish." "For heaven's sake, gentlemen, do not quarrel; there is more wine. John, help the gentlemen to wine. Anne, cut another loaf of bread." All this seeming kindness had but little effect; the brutal, beastly crew, were bent on crime, and their very eyes glared around in volup- tuous passion. That poor girl seemed to read her fate-her cheek paled, and she clung to her father. Her two brothers stood beside her, while John quietly got possession of a hatchet, which he secured about his person. The mother threw her arms around her daughter, and wept upon her bosom. It was a sight of horror, to see those innocent, happy people, in the iron grasp of murderers. /   THa TINKER SPY.            91 Dashing down a glass which he had in his hand, and shattering it ;-I,.x a thousand pieces, the leader started up, and seizing Anne, forced her brutally on his lap. A wild laugh followed the action, and as he threw his huge arms around- her, his lips came in contact with hers. O Then it was that the scream went forth; and on the wings of -the angels -of the wind it came sweeping through the air, and amid the snow and the sleet, it was conveyed to the three men whose approach we have heralded. The spirit angels of the winter's wind passed on, away, across the Delaware and the floating ice; they breathed the wanton outrage into the bosoms of the patriot soldiers, and that of their chief; it stunned them, as do the dreams of night, which harbinger good; they were aroused, and the unseen messengers of earth and air passed on and away to other places and other lands. What a fearful mystery is crea- tion! How wondrous, how miraculous are its ways; and He who com- mands, orders, and ordains, how mighty, majestic, and righteous. Let us describe a picture. The ruffian soldier had seized Anne, and was dragging her toward an inner room. Consternation and horror were depicted on the features of the alarmed and terrified family. It seemed as if heaven had deserted them, and in this fearful extremity they were left hopeless of succor. Hark! what strange sound is that? There was a flash-a hissing noise-a loud report-followed by a deep groan and the falling of a huge body. A bullet, sent by a sure and unerring hand, had entered deep into the heart of the ravisher, and its weight had crushed his soul down to Hades! Alarm seized all-a deep and solemn silence reigned 'for an instant.. The Hessians then seized their guns; but there came a deep voice sounding through the open window: "Down with' our arms--the house is surrounded-make the least resistance and you die the death of dogs. Place a guard, Captain -Sanford, back of the house. Sergeant Morris, secure the front" Springing, as he spoke, into the room, Collins stood before the sur- prised and cowardly Hessians, and the astonished family. "Farmer," exclaimed Collins, " get me ropes-we'll bind these men hand and foot; if they resist, I shall order my men in, and will have lthem hanged upon the trees in fiont of your door." The ropes were immediately procured, and in less than ten minutes, with the assistance of John, the old man and the two boys, the whole seven were as firmly tied as good hempen ropes and ready hands could effect. Collins went to the window and addressing Sanford, asked: "t Have you seen the light yet?" "No." "Well, order-in the soldiers; it is too cold to be outside on such a eight as this; give the word--" The old farmer came up to Collins, and told him that he had a large, comfortable barn, where the soldiers would find better quarters, and he would furnish them with provisions and liquor. "My dear sir, here comes my troops; there are but three of us." "Dunder and blitzen " was muttered by the prisoners, with other expletives equally as expressive of their astonishment.   92           THE TINKER SPY. "Ah!" exclaimed Collins, " do you see that, Sanford?" Sanford rushed to the window-a red glare of light uprose from the opposite shore, and, shed its livid, glare across the stream, and flashed even into the little room. "Now, farmer," exclaimed Collins, " show your patriotism-get a half e dozen bundles of straw-come, quick. Peter, you remain here with these cowardly rascals, and take care of these two fine boys-ah! and lovely girl, whom these villains would have wronged. But I peppered one of them-out with him-seize hold of his legs-let us take him to the barn, for the dead are no longer the subjects for man's hatred or revenge. Thus perish all human brutes!" In a very short space of time, a bright and flashing light rose up from the hill already alluded to; and there came upon the ear a mur- muring sound, as if it was the echo of some mighty voice. As the Hessians saw the signal, and heard the sound, they looked at each other, and muttered, Mein Cot!"p CHAPTER XXII. -----' His bold brow Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years, Not their decrepitude."--BYON. "Washington and Franklin lived for their country, and died worthy it and themselves."---ANON. Our readers are all familiar with the events which occurred on the night of the 25th, and the morning of the 26th of December. The crossing of the river Delaware, through a flood of floating ice, and the brilliant achievement of Washington at Trenton, and the consternation it created throughout the continent, are like familiar household words to all. But the effect this battle had, was of such a, character, that the al- most dying embers of hope which lie smouldering amid the ruin and wreck of our little army, now brightened up, and the sparks shot forth and cast their light; and amid the gloom that surrounded them, lit up an altar with a blaze that has never yet gone out, nor will it, until time ceases, and the works of- creation move no more. Such is the basis of liberty--such the destiny of our nation. The battle of Trenton furnished material for the nation to built up their chances of freedom. A writer, speaking of it, says --"This unex- pected and brilliant success, suddenly elevated the public mind from despondency, to extreme confidence." About fourteen hundred- soldiers whose service was on the point of expiring, agreed to remain six weeks longer; and the-militia from the neighboring provinces again began to join the army. Lord Cornwallis, then in New York, and on the point of sailing, for England, imagining-the war nearly ended, hastily returned to New Jersey with. additional, troops, to regain the ground that had been lost.   THE TINKER SPY.            . 93 -Nor was Washington disposed to remain idle. On the 28th of De- cember he boldly recrossed the Delaware, and took post at Trenton. The British had fallen back from the Delaware, and were assembling in great force at Princeton, resolved to attack Washington, in his quarters at Trenton, before he should receive reinforcements. Such was the situation of the two armies at the close of the year 1776. Only a week before, General Howe was leisurely awaiting the freezing of the Delaware, to enable him to tgke quiet possession of Philadelphia, annihilate the American army at a blow, should it not, (as tas expected,) previously be disbanded by the desertion of its militia. But how much was Howe surprised, when he found that the remnant of the American army had suddenly assumed offensive operations; and its commander, although opposed by far superior forces, now indulged the hope of recovering, during the winter, the whole, or the greater part of New Jersey. Colonel Collins, Captain Sanford, and Sergeant Morris were no longer playing hide and seek; they had won the confidence of the General by their bold undertaking at Trenton, and he held them in high estimation. It was while encamped at Trenton, both Collins and Sanford received letters from Colonel Clayton, and, of course, separate epistles from their "Iadye loves." The contents of Colonel Clayton's letter was somewhat shrouded in mystery. He stated in the one in question: "I have made my will-it is duly recorded-and my daughter is in possession of all the particulars of my fortune, estates, &c. I may never return from the expedition I am about embarking on. If I fall, Sanford, you will, I know you will, be to my child all that a husband should be. Wealth will be yours, but that, I am aware, you value only as a second- ary matter in love. I will not give the reasons for this mysterious move- ment on my part-suffice it to say, that in consequence of my opening my doors to our mutual friend, Colonel Collins, I have been denounced by the-l ng and his minions. Aye, Sanford, minions is the word. I have been insulted epistolary, by Lord Howe; and Cornwallis has ex- pressed similar sentiments. As regards these insults, I have returned them ten-fold, and dared them to the 'outrance.? No more of this. I leave home to-morrow. Mrs. Maxwell, a lady of my acquaintance, will take charge of my house; she is a lady, but reduced in circumstances, and my house will hereafter be her home, so I think Laura is in good hands. Jane, you know, is no longer a servant; she is my daughter's companion-sister-friend. Farewell, my boy-son, I may call you- and when next we meet, it may be-well, no more. Farewell. CLAYTON." Sanford read the letter attentively. Collins was equally surprised, and although he hinted that he might read the riddle, still he showed no disposition to do so. It was on the morning of the 2d of January, 1777, that the British, under Cornwallis, marched toward Trenton for the purpose of crushing the American army by a masterly stroke of military skill. Washington's united forces of Generals Mifflin and Cadwalader, did not exceed five thousand men. Washington, aware of the inefficincy of his force, im-   "          THE TINKER SPY. mediately withdrew to the east side of a small creek, called the Sanpink, (on the maps of the war, written Assumpick,) and planted his cannon near the ford, to defend its passages. The British followed close in their rear, entering the town about four o'clock in the afternoon, and a heavy cannonade commenced between the two armies, which were only sepa- rated by the Sanpink and its narrow valley. At this moment, two dis- tinct events occurred, which it is necessary to mention. A small bridge connected the grounds at a small opening in the wood. At that point, a skirmish took place between some of the British and Americans, which the loud voice of 'Washington commanded to cease, as he perceived the British General was not pushing his men to the attack. "Colonel Collins, see to that point, and draw off the men-it is not policy for us to seek a battle now." Collins immediately rode down, and, to his surprise, found Serge-ant Morris attempting to out away the bridge, backed by some fifty of his men, and exposed to a succession of shots from the foe. Collins immediately commanded Peter to desist, and ordered the men into the ranks, placing a guard at that point; and perceiving the British disposed to cease hostilities, he was in the act of departing, when the figure of a man was seen stealing as it were through the woods. Fear- ing some treachery, he shouted out, "Halt, or I'll fire." To this com- mand, the man stopped, and beckoned Collins toward him, still keeping in the shadow of the trees. The Colonel immediately approached the spot, but what was his astonishment, when in the mysterious stranger he recognized Colonel Clayton. "Gracious heavens! what means this i" 'ItR means, Collins, that I am a desperate man; my mind has been in'a feverish state ever since I received the insult from Howe and Corn- wallis. I challenged the latter this morning-I branded him, before his officers, as a coward. He mocked me. By heavens! that a man should live to mock me. Collins, I am not an Englishman; my father was a Scotchman; one of that clan, through whose blood ran the stream of a kingly line. They fought for their mountains and their hills, their rivers and their valleys; they fought for liberty, but missed it. The blood of my ancestry is boiling in my veins-I could not remain at home-I am here -I purpose to join your company, and fight for Washington, and the land he purposes to give freedom to." ( Is this real "' "I know not, Collins, for it seems to me as a dream-but I have some- thing to impart of consequence. In my hearing, Erskine said to Corn- wallis, 'now is the time,' after Washington had retreated across the creek, 'to make sure of your prize' 'Oh, no-!' replied Cornwallis, 'our troops have marched a good way to-day, and are tired, and the old fox can't make his escape; for with the help of the Delaware, now filled with ice, we have completely surrounded him. To-morrow morning,' says he, 'we'll fall upon him, and take him and his ragamuffin crew all at once.' To this, Erskine replied, 'Ah, my lord, if Washington be the soldier that I fear he is, you'll not see him there to-morrow morning.' This much I learned, and his not following up the attack, satisfies me of the truth."   THE TINKER SPY.            95 "This is indeed important. Come, Colonel, with me to the General- you must know hitn." l"No, Collins-you see I am-disguised-do not tell Sanford of this; if 'he recognizes me, well and good-enrol me among your men, and know me only ,s John Armstrong." "But rememberd-" "I'll remember nothing, Collins; I would have gone mad if I had remained at home. You know my nature-it is cruel; I believe even worse than that. I have endeavored to make some amends for the past, but do not thwart me in this. I will fight, though I knew the earth were to be my winding sheet, and the pale moon my watcher." Collins, fearful of exciting him further, promised all he asked, and they took their way to the camp. The camp of Washington! There is something melancholy connected with that name, associated, as it is, with the trying events of the Revo- lution. Yet Washington's tent, on the occasion to which we now refer, presented a somewhat cheerful appearance. The dull sounds which per- vade an encampment, were almost silenced; the watch fires had gone out; all was still among, the Americans. But not so on the opposite side of the Assumpick creek, where the Bri:ish were' encamped, the sounds issuing from which were of a different character. A constant revel was Lept up, and strains of music came upon the ear, as if from the gay and joyous scenes of a ball-room. Stationed at the front of Washington's tent, stood our old friend, Peter Morris; his hand was. grasped firmly by one whose name now stood high among the soldiery of the American army-it was his old master, Benjamin Franklin. "Ah, Peter, my boy," exclaimed the philosopher, "we meet again in perilous times, but you are a brave lad, and -will win honor and fame."' "Indeed, Mr. Franklin, I have gained a little of that already, if I am-, - to believe what they tell me Washington has already said of me." "Ah, I remember. Yes, he spoke of a bold and daring act performed by three of his officers-Collins, Sanford, and--" "Myself, sir." "Brave lad. Take this, Peter, and in after life, and amid other'spenes, remember that you had a friend, and his name was Benjamin Franklin. God bless you." So saying, the philosopher entered the tent of Washington. Peter wiped a tear from his eye-gazed upon the gift, an old-fashioned watch, and carefully deposited it in his pocket. Had he been a poet, how applicable would have been these lines, if uttered by him that moment:                     l "'We take no note of time, But from its loss To give it then a tongue Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke I feel the solemn sound." Indeed, as Peter stood, the ticking of the watch, and the loud beating of his heart, did produce a 1"solemn sound;" and yet there were other sounds which broke upon his ear.    "Like to this, In the great city the cathedral clock, Lifting its iron tongue, doth seem to stay Time for a moment, while it calls aloud-- How goes the midnight?" Aye, ere that period arrived, great events occurred. Yet both armies supped--and many that were not titled lords, and licensed revellers, slept. "How goes the midnight?"Aye, ask it in the morning. In the tent of Washington sat two men. Great men; men whose names will live throughout all time, and only cease to be remembered, when the name of liberty is lost to men and nations. The name of one of these men was WASHNGTON--the other, FRANKLIN. "I could not leave you, my brave friend, without one more interview. I leave for France in a few days, and with some risks, I own, here I am to bid you farewell." These words were addressed by Franklin to General Washington. "I heard that Congress deemed it necessary to suggest that you should go, and I fully concur with it in that opinion. Go, my valued friend; the same spirit that animated you here, will carry vou through, and accom- plish whateverjyou undertake. We are, my friend, in a very peculiar position. Here I am, surrounded by foes, outnumbering me three to one.  Lord Howe has possession of all the principal towns; his brother, you are aware, has brought over a large body of well disciplined troops, against which I have to contend with a mere handful of men. I have, however, linked my life to the car of freedom; if the chain breaks, 't is well; man can do no more than I have, to sustain and maintain this un- equal combat." "You are gloomy, my friend; but have you not observed, when stand- ing upon some high piece of ground, or mountain top, the rising of the sun I have you not watched the streaks of light come gradually up and radiating from one seeming focus? have you not watched their golden streams of light as they lengthened forth over hill, dale and valley e have you not observed, how they mingled their light with the shades of re- tiring night, which are soon lost in the full brightness of the opening day? have you-"-- "No more, my friend; I fully comprehend your beautiful similie, and may heaven so mingle our rising beams of liberty, with the gloom that surrounds us, that we 411 may bail that bright dawn of never-ending freedom."    -   - "To secure freedom properly, General, the intelligence of the people must be consulted.  Your position and character have given a tone and coloring to the cause, which must insure success. We have offers from France, and I fell satisfied that upon my arrival there, means will be raised to realize the hope the promise has excited in our breasts." "Heaven grant it, was- the response of Washington. But, my friend, months will elapse before succor from France will arrive. Cornwallis is now, as you are aware, within a few yards of this very camp. Had he followed up the attack this afternoon, I must have fallen; as it is, I am saved. A trusty friend has just given me information of the utmost   THE TINKER SPY.            97 importance. In a few hours, quietly, and in the utmost silence, we vacate this spot; -and let me whisper in your car-" -( Gracious heaven, are you raving!" "No, my friend, only going to exercise my men. If I succeed in this movement, it will place me in a position 'to maintain my ground. If I fail, the cause, I am afraid, is lost. So, my friend, you leave us in a dark and gloomy hour." 'I will not leave you until the result of this is known. I am old, but my blood is not yet chilled, nor is this arm destitute of strength." "Ah, Franklin, the hand that knows how to wield a pen, can scarcely be expected to grasp with equal power, the sword. Be yours the hand to plan-mine, the hand to strike. Hark! the guard is relieved; in one hour more, when the last strain of music from the gay camp of my foes ceases, we will be on our march." All was silent-the patrol anfd the watch were on duty, and the Americans could hear the voices of the officers, as they relieved guard. Among the Americans, the strictest silence prevailed; the fires, in ac- cordance to Washington's order, had long since been put out. A solitary sentinel stood on the bank of the little stream, and his slow, steady step, gave the only evidence to the foe that an army lay encamped so near. The night was dark; the weather was warm; and the air moist, although in mid-winter. Still did that sentinel move on; his measured tread continued; at last he stopped; the streaks of the morning came slowly up; the sentinel stood firm; he moved not. The British sentinel on the opposite side shouted and mocked him; the figure moved not; now the British began to move-the drum beat-the attack was about to begin. Washington and his little band were now to be sacrificed. Cornwallis stood in front of his tent; Erskine was beside him. The morning air was chilly. Gradually the shades of night began to move away. "Ah! there is my foe," exclaimed Cornwallis. "See that solitary sentinel. Ha! they are all hushed in slumber. By heaven, Erskine, Washington is caught in his own trap." "If he is, General, he is not the soldier I dreaded he was." "What mean you? Ah! what do I see? Erskine, look yonder; by heavens, he has struck his tents!" As he spoke, a flash of musketry shot across the stream, and the silent sentinel on the opposite bank, fell upon the frozen ground. Then came a shout, and the words, "A trick! a trick!" ran like wildfire throughout the British encampment. The figure was a made up one, Peter having prepared it expressly for that occasion. Erskine looked at Cornwallis; a smile played upon his countenance, which passed quickly away as he noticed the pale, quivering lips of his noble companion. The echo of the discharge of musketry upon the stuffed figure had scarcely died away, when there came upon the air the deep roar of cannon. Bang--bang-came up in quick succession. - Consternation sat like death upon the upraised faces of the men, as they were turned mechanically in the direction of the sounds. Again came the roar of cannon; Cornwallis turned his eyes,   THE TINKER SPY. now blood-shot witfih concentrated anger, upon Sir William Erskine. That gentleman returned his fixed gaze; a sentence passed his lips: "Washington is at Princeton!" ' 6Aye! and cutting up my troops." And so he was. Let us retrograde awhile, and follow the movements ,of Washington, from the time he left Trenton. CHAPTER    XXIII. "Instant, through copse and heath, arose Bonnets and spears and bended bows; On right, on left, above, below, Sprung up at once the lurking foe."-'LADY OF THE LAKE. Peter Morris; with six men, was sent on ahead to mark the road, and observe the locality of the ground. As he plays a somewhat important. part in this battle, for awhile let us follow him on his expedition. Reach- ing within a short distance of the British encampment, they espied a large tree standing solitary and alone, at the conjunction of two roads.. It was hollow, but its wide-spreading branches, now leafless, afforded, however, an excellent place for observation. They reached the tree, and having deposited their muskets in its hollow recess, they crept along the fence, so as they might get a better view of the foe. At that very moment a small detachment of the British, under command of Lieute- nant Colonel Mawhood, was seen'to approach, and the six men who ac- companied Peter, becoming alarmed, started rapidly down toward a wood which skirted the meadow ground, while Peter sought the tree as a more secure place. He found that the whole of the trunk was rotten and hollow up to the largest branches Feeling himself perfectly secure, he watched the operations of the approaching enemy.  As he cast his eyes down the road, to his surprise he discovered the advance of Washing- ton's armv, and almost simultaneously the British marched out of Prince- ton, with the intention of joining Cornwallis at'Trenton, to secure the American army by a coup de main. Peter in a moment comprehended his danger, for the tree in which he was hidden, if the two armies met, would be in the very midst of the strife. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "there is General   Mfercer. Ah! Mawhood espies their approach."   In an instant the advance of the A mericans was opposed by the Colonel. Being composed chiefly of militia, they gave way, and the few regulars attached to them could not maintain their ground. General Mercer in vain attempted to rally them, and in striving to do so, received   a mortal wound.  The British rushed forward with fixed bayonets, and drove the Americans back.  Peter's heart sank within him  As the Americans retreated he found himself, as it   were, isolated. "Ah!" he shouted, as he glanced down  the road, "there comes Washington."    THE TINKER SPY.           99 The moment the British saw the approach of the main body, they gradually retraced their steps; but at that moment another company of the British force marched out of Princeton, and joining Lieut. Col. Mawhood, made a bold stand to oppose the approach of Washington. Now commenced one, of those desperate struggles, in which thes Americans so distinguished themselves, by contending, with inferior force. with the best disciplined troops of Europe.. In the first fire the Americans gradually yielded, and fell back. It was during this stage of the fight the following scene occurred, near the tree in which Peter was concealed: . "There they go," exclaimed Peter, as tears streamed down his cheeks, " there they go--all is lost." While he thus spoke, he observed the well known features of Collins, striving to restrain his men. In the attempt to do so, he was seized by + three British soldiers. Breaking away from them, he stood on the de- fensive. ' Yield," cried one of the soldiers. "Never!" roared Collins. "Then die, rebel as you. are." "No you don't," shouted Peter, and the soldier measured his length on the ground.  Collins gave one look towards the tree, and the next moment was among his own men. "Good," exclaimed Peter; " five more muskets loaded, and powder and ball for six more. Ah! by heavens, there comes Washington." And so it was. Towering, like some fabled giant, far above all who surrounded him, the great commander dashed forward on his splendid war-horse. Snatching a standard from the retreating bearer, he raised it far above his head, and in a voice that seemed to thrill through every frame like an electric shock, he shouted, i; Forward!" They heard the cry, and rushed boldly on to the charge. Amid the smoke, the blaze ind roar of musketry, the form of Washington was seen, while his sword flashed around him like lightning. "Well done," exclaimed Peter, ' iAh! there is a chap taking aim at the general; look out, red-coat." Then went forth from the tree a lash, a sound, and the tall form of a red-coat stretched itself in sleep eternal on the frozen ground. Peter's situation, however, was some- what precarious. The balls whistled around him. The closeness of the branches kept him from sight, and the hollow trunk afforded him good shelter. While this scene was going on, one widely different was transpiring n another part of the field. Sanford was maintaining a point with  most determined bravery. His little band for a moment seemed to         hesitate, when there rushed forward a man, dressed in a soldier's uni-     form, sword in hand, and placed himself immediately before the corn-     J mander of the British 'detachment in that part of the field. Down went the English commander, on rushed the Americans; the desperate  man who thus changed the tide in favor of Sanford still maintained ti the lead, until he saw Sanford bringing his men rapidly forward; he     j then fell into the ranks, and took an humble position. Sanford recog- nized him, however, and astonishment for a moment unnerved him.      100          THE TINIKER aSP. Shaking the feeling off, he rushed into the midst of the battle. In -the bold soldier he recognized Colonel Clayton. Let us once more to the tree. The tide of the battle had now changed toward another part of the field. Peter still kept up a continued fire, and every ball told a fear- ful tale. A party of the enemy, having been cut off from the main body, now approached the tree. One of their number made a full stop, and glancing his eyes toward the tree, remarked to his companions that he had noticed during the engagement several shots being fired from its branches. "Ah! comrades, look here; as I live there is the rascal; let us wing him." I Make ready'-fire. Ah, he falls." The body of Peter fell down through the hollow space, and rolled out upon the ground, a seeming corpse. "Ha, hal he's done -for. Now, boys, on; the enemy is pressing us hard; Washington seems invulnerable to powder and ball." "And so am I," exclaimed Peter, as he sprang from the ground and regained the tree. Again the tide of battle changed-again the British rallied, and the vicinity of the old tree once more became the scene of deadly strife. "Ah, they give way-huzza!" and Peter shouted, and fired volleys from the tree. But his escape from death was almost a miracle, for he was literally placed between two fires. Down came a-flying troop of the British-on fiercely they galloped, pursued by our triumphant soldiery, headed by the immortal chieftain, Washington. "Up with the standard," he shouted, as he halted beneath the tree, the day is ours. Bravely fought, boys. And you, my brave young friends,' Monroe and Sanford, behaved nobly. Col. Collins, see to the pursuing men, and you, Lieutenant Monroe, stay the unnecessary shed- ding of blood. The men, exasperated at the brutality of the Hessians, vent their revenge upon the British." His orders were promptly obeyed, but the result of such generosity liked to have proved fatal, for a detachment of the enemy, which had not been in the engagement, now came fresh upon the' field from Princeton, and boldly attacked the small party, at the head of which Washington now placed himself, and gave the order promptly, San- ford, take the right of me; CoL Haslet will lead the left wing. On." A fire from the enemy for a moment caused them to halt. Col, Haslet was instantly killed. ' pt. Neal, a brave Pennsylvanian, sprang upon the Colonel's horse, and the little party stood the onset. Several of Washington's men fell down at his feet-sWords flashed-muskets roared--and amid the smoke and confusion a party of the British had nearly surrounded Washington. Peter sprang from the tree, snatched a sword from the body of a dying officer, and stood before the rearing steed of Washington. Now commenced a desperate encounter. It was but short, for Collins and Monroe were seen scouring o'er the plain, and in an instant the scene changed. The whole of this detachment of the enemy were taken prisoners, and they grounded their arms and yielded without a word.   THE TINKER SPY.           101 "Thanks, my brave lad," were the first words spoken by Washing- ton, as he laid his martial hand on the head of Peter. "Collins, I thank you--Monroe, your hand. Now, my brave lads, for Princeton." When Franklin met Washington at Princeton, he grasped his hand, and exclaimed enthusiastically, "o Freedom's sun has not yet set." Peter was a hero, for Washington had said it. The events of the war were ended. The 19th of October, 1781, closed, for a period of thirty-three years, all accounts between the Americans and the English. The surrender of Cornwallis stamped us a nation, as the deeds of our sires had made the impress, engraving the word Liberty with the points of their swords. The House of Commons, in 1782, acknowledged that seal, and the monarch of England reluc-. tantly consented to acknowledge our independence. Philadelphia now became the centre of beauty and of fashion. The weight of tyranny was removed, and the buoyant spirit of a happy people kept up a continual sunshine of human happiness. Time rolled on--men and Manners became changed, and the immortal Washington was the beloved, and almost worshiped, object of the people. It was on a lovely afternoon in June, some time after the close of the war, that a gentleman was walking leisurely through the avenue leading from the old State House to Walnut street. The venerable trees seemed to bow down their huge branches as he passed beneath them, and the breeze, as it wantoned through their leafy foliage, murmured a name dear to a nation. , The individual alluded to was dressed in the fashion of the day. His coat was of cut silk velvet; his hair, slightly powdered, was gathered into a queue behind. On 'his head was a cocked hat, with a black- cockade; the edges were adorned with a black feather, almost an inch deep. He wore light gloves, knee and shoe buckles, and a long dress sword. As he approached the small clusters of nurses and children scat- . tered about, Key all ceased their play, and gazed in silent respect upon the disti uished man, for such he was. He paused before a group, consisting of two nurses and four lovely children. .The oldest of the boys, for there were two, approached him, and taking him by the hand, kissed it, then smiling with the joyousness of boyhood, said, pointing to a lovely little girl, who stood abashed' beside him, "This is my sister." "Brave boy," said the gentleman, "so you know me; eh?" "Oh, yes; I can never f6rget you." "Nor 1," lisped the girl "Nor I," replied the second boy, as he took hold of his hand. "Nor I," said his sister, as she sidled up and took hold of the end of . his sword. "God bless you, my dears, you are the children of two brave men. Your name is, I think "- addressing the oldest boy.   102          THE TINKER SPY. "George Washington Collins," was the ready response; "and my -sister's hame is Martha." A tear stood in the eye of the gentleman. "And yours?" he remarked, taking the hand of the youngest lad. "Washington Clayton Sanford; and my little sister is called Anne Martha Sanford. Ah! here comes grandfather." They all turned in the direction, and there approached them a man of remarkable appearance. His hair was white, but his stately form and full rounded face denoted health and great physical power. "Colonel Clayton," exclaimed the first, as he seized the hand of the -veteran-looking soldier, for such our readers know him to have been, 4'I am delighted to see you. Look, sir, am I not in good company?" glancing at the little group that encircled him. "General Washington," replied Colonel Clayton, "will always find himself thus surrounded, for even the aged will become infants, and weep for joy, as H-I-almost feel disposed to do now. God bless you, -sir!" and the Colonel passed his hands rapidly across his eyes.. "Colonel, your hand; let us walk down this avenue. Children, amuse yourselves until we return." On the banks of the river Schuylkill, some eighteen miles from the city of Philadelphia, there stands, in- the midst of all the riches of an ,extensive- farm, an old-fashioned dwelling. It is composed of what is . called "marbled stone," and bears upon its front the evidence of being erected in 1702. Into a room of this old house, on the evening follow- ing the scene we have already described, we now introduce the reader. Four persons, if a smiling-faced boy of some ten years old can be included in the category, were seated around what we in the country -call a "cheerful family table." Indeed, the word "cheerful" suited well the occasion alluded to, for the smile that illuminated the face of the man, was reflected upon the loving countenances which surrounded him-those of his wife, his wife's sister, and son. "Well, father," exclaimed the boy, who, it seems, hA been listening with some attention to the conversation--"well, father,"-and his eyes sparkled as he spoke--"and you fired from the tree?" "Yes; and for every shot fired, a human life paid the penalty! Oh! but it was a fearful sight! The dead and the dying lay scattered around, and the roar of cannon and the roll of drums deafened the very air. The fate of our beloved country depended as much upon that battle, as it did upon any other fought in the Revolution. Driven from place to place, Washington, like the stag at bay, had to fight and con- quer, or lose the only chance of infusing new life into the almost expiring hopes the Americans had of success. That battle decided it; and the flame that went up from the burning embers on the fields of Princeton, has never ceased to flicker around the altars of our land, reared and dedicated to Liberty. - Aye, it was a sight to see Washington on his fiery charger, himself towering above all around him, dashing       THE TINKER SPY.           103 -through fire and smoke, cheering his men on to liberty or death-it was either for one or the other;--I shall never forget it!" "Dear husband, it was indeed a dreadful day!" "I should like to see a battle, father," exclaimed the boy. "Your namesake, my son, was there to congratulate Washington, at its close." "What, my godfather, Benjamin Franklin " "Aye; that great man was there. That gun, which your mother ,thinks so much of, and keeps suspended there like Mahomet's coffin, did your father some good service. Keep it there, wife, if it please you; and in after years, when we shall have passed away from this earth, our children may speak of it, and tell the story as I have told it now." Silence for a moment followed these Words, and a tear started in the eye of Peter Morris, the owner of that rich and magnificent farm, the homestead of his father, now his own, for the old man had died, and that which was almost valueless under a monarch's rule, was a fortune to his son under that of presidents. He had yet a prouder title--that of being WASHNGTON'S FRIEND!
