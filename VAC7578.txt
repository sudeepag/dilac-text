PART FIRST.
CH ILM       ,
ON a chilly ?Tovemter afternoon there stood near the
gutter, in Passyunk RAoad below Shippen Stieet in Phira-
delphia, a little girl with a basket in her hand, waiting for.
her drunken father who was looking in at a shop-window.
She had a very sad face and was about ten years old. The
shop before which the man stood was close by, and was one
of a kind common in the neighbourhood; its stock consist-
ing of an assortment of miscellaneous merchandise.
The drunkard'a bare hands were half sunk down into
his antaloons' pockets, and he had that weak-in-the-back
look, so usual in those of his habit. His hat was old, and
half - slouched over his forehead. A maudlin gaze was
directed uponi tbe display before him, but his face had a
vacant stare and his eyes a glassy look, le appeared to
have forgotten every thing he had ever known and himself-
too.

There was an, impress of character. upon the child's,
face. She could not be older than the age mentioned, yet
there was traced legibly in lines not to be mistaken, the
care-worn look of which we think as belonging of right only
to the mature in years ;-and I thank God every day of my.
life that .it ,is so: :tht the multitude of little children.
throughout fie wiIde world retel inthe happy unconscious/
ness of the toil and struggles which those who love therii
endure, and cheerfully too, for their sakes. A little cuily
head, Annie, whom we. call Bunny-face, that plays every
day underneath my study window when the weather is fair
enough for her to do so, what a different look she has ,out
of her eyes from that of the one standing with such thin
clothes on, and shivering at the c0ity, gutter-side, and who
has evidently conned over many pages of life's experience,
and learned lessons of tria and endurance,
Sh stoodhfora few minutes, 'the father absorbed in
his reverie at the window, when two other girls of about
the same ag, and livingin the neighborhood, came out of'
a so      eral door of and walked on together in the
,directionowards her. They were without their bonnets,
but theiclothing was warm,_And made up of materials of
bright colours  d very large figures. The two were
absorbed inisdiscussion about their dress, and their tones
as they walked along grew angrier,'every moment ;-when,
looking up, they suddenly aw the pale shabby little thing
before tim, and laughed out, rude, at her.
The colour pushed up into the poor child's face; and
her little iti quivered all arodndfwith suffering. The
tears started, butwith a firm resoleA she' forced them back,

and her eyelashes dropped as though she would shut out
the sight of the tormentors in front of: her
"Oh, what a love of a bonnet,-is'ntit Maria Jane?"
said the one infiery red scattered all-over with hig palm
leavesto her companion, asshe glayjced contemptuously at
the- over-large, motherly-looking article on the ,"hild's
head. "Just see thenice clean stringS tool It looks as
if it was the last. fresh fashion, take it all in all, does 'at_
it? "
"I like most the young lady's dress ,"-scoffingly
replied Ahe other, ag yith a scat  look0h., noted the
half-worn and evidently altered garment before her--and
then, lowering her eyes, rested them with, satisfaction upon.
the yellow and maarmrine4blue texture enveloping her ow
fat person, and in which these two colours struggled, in
large dots, for predominance. Soon, renewing her atre, she
continued: "The waist looks as if it belonged to seme big
old aunty, and the skirt cut off short: and such: a sha l
too!   I wonder where the other three-quarters;have
walked off! Can you tell, Angelina ? "_ and she looked
quizzically into the face of her associate.,
"I do n't -know,.1I'm sure; but I guess to hunt up a
pair of stockings. Oh see, what a. beautiful esh colour
hers are; and the shoes too, are of a holy ,Pern." This
miserable pun wasfollowed y a derisive laugh from both
of them.
They waited a moment in expectation of an answer to
their taunts, but as none eame, they renewed their giving
talk  and,, moving still 'closer  towards their victim,
endeavored to push her off the curb-stone into the gutter;

and would have succeeded had she not held on with her
disengaged hand -toan awning-post, near which they were
standing. They then tried to tread upon her toes peeping
through her shoes, and she with difculty preventedtem;
for, her earnest and touching supplication of "lease-
don't!" fell upon deaf ears.
It was' over-fed and: warma-clothed vulgarity ,spitting-
out its" venom ,upon the- powerless--a sight sad and
pitiable-yet,under many different guises, alas! how often-
to be seen.
The voices of the children rose louder and louder, and'
an' unusually earnest ""Ohlease don't!" reached the
ears of the father, who turning , round, instinctively
comprehended at a glaice, halfdrunk as he was, the
ignominious position' of his child. A  flush of shame'
spread over his face' as he walked unsteadily towards her,
and taking her by the hand he led her away. A group of
other "children, boys and girls,-of .the Maria Jane and
Angelina genus,-had already gathered around, and amid:
their united gibes and jeers the drunken father and
miserable child proceeded some distance further down the
street until a passing -showman, with a monkey and a
violin, arrested the, attention of the vicious juveniles, and
the pair were permitted to go unmolested, on their way.
Along, down the ,Pasyunk 'Road' they walked some'
distance, and then turned into'-a miserable looking cross-
street. After travelling it nearly the length of a square
they u6e to    narrow  tuubl-down-srt of a court,
which' they entered, ad stopping at"its further end,

man. fumbled through his pockets.for the key of the door,
whioh was looked.,
Nor iril;norianyhad' spoken one word to each other-;
silently and in shame they had walked hand in hand to
their -home. "PAther," at length she said, rousing her
faculties with an efrtyou -know I took,,the k3y this
morning, and I was to call for you after I had rsold my
nimatches -and things ;" at the same time producing from
the original large pocket of her dress the door-key ; and
unlocking it, they went into the room'together.
The place was, as the:girl had left it 'in: the morning,
tidyed up for the. day, and, was lighted by, one dormer
window. It was altogether very poor*looking. A small
sheet-iron stove, stood in that part. where the -ceiling was
the highest, just under the mid-gable- of the roof, and the
stovepipe holeopened directly into the chimney.
She busily bestirred herself and soon lighted a fire in
the stove and on its top set soinewater-'in a.vessel to heat
which she poured: out from a bucket-full that. stood in a
corner.  The more steadily she worked the better phe
appeared to feel. The" man sate down upon a chair which
had no back and leaning forward hid his face in his hands;
but as he felt the warmth of the fire he; stretched them out
towards the stove ,to warm   them, stealing a glance
occasionally at his child.  The wretched fellow  was
sobering.
At length, after.she hgd made a cup of tea. in which
were neither sugar nor mIk, she approached him gently
and said: "Father please drink this. It will make you

his arm. Their eyes met-and, as they looked long and
wistfully at each other, tears filled themand the words:
"My poor child A and "h father I" felrom. their
lips.d
Come here, poor little onel" he said; and she, came
and' croudhed down on the bare floors her headsresting on
his knees,-and began to sob as if her heart would break;
andhe,with his shaky handasmoothed her brown curly
hair and'tried to soothe her weeping. He uttered words
of affection every,,gow and then, tears coursigg down his
cheeks-drunkards are givento. crying-but the child's,
breast headed onsurestrainedly for the pent up feelings
must sometimeshave a vent.
"YTur father loves dearly his, por motherless child;"
he said, after- some time had elapsed, and the words almost
choking him "no matter how little it may seem that he'
does."
She looked up into hisce and wiping her eyes with
the sleeve'of her dress, said in a wiper, Father do talk
to me aboit mother. Tell me afl you can remember; it will
do me more goodthan any thing else i" and her face sunk
again downuponhi knees and the sobs succeeded each

printr-of..the tOwn and editor .of apapgr the young
husband was regarded as a man of important in the
settlement ; besides he was intelligent and kind-hearted.
Lsucy West was ashappy abride as many another whose
fate has turned out as sadly as her own.
The irst blothat came to them after her bridal was
t4xdearthof. er fher:    then   .heir first child a boy,
of two years old,died. Their grayes are in that far-off
western itygehurehyard on tje sloping side .of a green
hl. It was one nights a few  eeks after the, death of
the little oy, that Mr. Westwas induced by two of his
friends, rich men and irp 4rtant pa1rgns, to go out with
them, on sone election business; and, after midnight, they
brought hiin.to his home stupidly drunk ! Ever from that
hour. a baleful star threw its malignant rays over their
pathway.: No tears could quench it, and it at last drank
pd-ropafter drop, the life blood of,!the patient, suffering
wife. Property, friends; respect of townsfolk, all gradually
disappeared. She followehim aown, down into- ever
lower depth of degradation. From town to town, and city
to city, theywandered; and she was the ministering angel
who.wasever ready to pity, and ,to. hope that, each new
falling away wouldJbe the last. Their little girl Lizzie was
only one .year old when they left the town where the mother
had been once so happy a bride.
Mr. West was a rapid and correct compositor, 'and
time and again with his intellectual ability, h might have
risenhigher'In the soial scale than he had ever been before,
but for the demon of strong. drink, It b'o'nd him- as
strongly as the Python encircled-the old priest in ancient

Grecian story, and the poisonousbreathof, histemptation
benuibed its victim so that his struggles became feebler
andstill more feeble.
The rinducements to drink about a printig-office are
frequent, and to a lover of it almost, overpowering  The
craft are'. toa fault. generous with money, and are
exceedingly courteous and gentlemanly in theirintercourse
with each other. In the offices where, he was employed he
was often pressed to indulge irn drinks to which -he- was
treated, and then, after the taste was once imbibed, there
was no; stay until his. " spree " was out.
It was about two years before the present time that
Mrs. West, -heart-broken, died;' and the expenses of her
funeral were paid, and willingly too- by the combined
contributions of the journeymen printers of the city,"who
turned out in a body to pay the last token of respect to one
who -was generally known among them as the true-hearted
wife of their drunken brother-workman.
Lizzie's childhoodJad bgn darkened by sorrow and
straitened circumstances.  The cloud was scarcely ever
lifted up.,In funereal gloom it had shut.in, her youth-time
amid its dark enfoldings.  No wonder the child was
premature, and that a careworn look was deeply defined
upon her little face which, had it but worn the joyous
expression usual in. childhood, wogld have been beautiful
as the realization of a "poet's dream."  Nowi that her dear
mother was gone, still deeper settled the darkness around
her;- and she had to standias much so as a child could, in
that dear mother's place to her erring father.
She earned what she could by selling matches, tapes

That.. over, she sat down to her sewing which-was a shirt
for her father; aihd he crept into bed and fu  a l-ngfwhile
.watched her thin, sweet face, untiLat lengthhe fell aleep.
She sewed on, and on -but her thoughts were not .upon
the garment in her. hands,-she was- treasuring i  all
that she had heard that was new to her about:her mo er.
The miser Iovesto gloatover his yellow gol  ndthe
chink of coins music in his- ears,'aye. andit hushea into
dormant sleep all the finer,-nobler impulsesof: his hea*--
but no miser ever loved gold as she did the, memory ofher
dead mother; each'sgeparaht instance of ,her devoted love
was a pearl of priceless value in the child's Casket of the
Past, and every new knowledge of her self-sacrifice was as
if she heard the harping of some angel lyre encouraging
her in the mission of duty to the father left behind.
The remembrance forcibly returned to her mind as she
sat there in the silence-interrupted only by the deep
breathing of her father-of that afternoon, the last time,
that her mother ever went ou when they two took some
sewing that was finished to a lady's house,and upon their
return her mother would stop in at an .ice-cream saloon,
and, purchasing a single saucersat with her at the marble
table in the grand-looking room and there, with her face
all lit up with unutterable love,fed her out of the silver
spoon, with mouthful after mouthful of the cool delicious
cream, and would not take one particle of it herself-
.although she begged her hard to do so. All the scene came
back so vividly before her that she felt as if it was again a
reality; that her mother was now very near her and her
arms almost around her.

The clock in the State House steeple struck twelve.-
She put out the light, kneeled down beside the hard, small
bed onthe other side of the room  from ,where her, father
slept, and, prayed asi she -had been- taught to the ever;
watchful God above, and then, after. undi'essing, crept into
herbed.- But ere that child closed her eyes in sleep, her
evening hymn sounded out on the midnight. hour, in a soft
silver-toned young voice of song, and the words taught her
byher another were those familiar to most of the households
of our present time:
"Fatherhigh in eavenhear me;

TEN years--a'long period in &amp; human lifehas passed
since the time when was introduced to our readers the
drunkard-father and the- care-tricken, child. That child
had grown into woman's years. The father was -still a
victim to his vice.
There had been during this interval frequent temporary
lulls of reformation in the man's, dissipation... ut the
monster in his bosom still lived on,,and was warmed again
and again into new lifeand then, with-,erectedfCrest and
forked - tongue re-asserted its fiend-like ,supremacy. He
was weaker far, mentally, morally and. physically, than
would be ordinarily produced by ten years' wear and tear
in this world of ours:--his hair was .now almost all white
and his,-face was plowed: with deep furrows  His whole
physique was animalized, and his mouth especially had
become Silenus-like in its expression, besides his beard was
nearly; always in a. neglectedstate :-sad indeed, were
the changes that ten years had wrought upon Joseph West,

and for the most part they were the effects of indulgence
in his degrading vice.
He had not for a long time been able to work at
his trade; but was employed occasionally at odd services,
about a few of the printing-ofces--sometimes perform-
ing the duties of roller-boy  and  oing upon errands.
He also folded- newspaeis, andabld them in the
streets. He seemed, to the exiting race of journeymen
printers, an old patriarch of the craft-and most of them,
likehen  d  bheth,twerekiidly disposed toover over
the frailties of the  pitelyeyaiva old man.

bornewith a willing spirit the lnond flowers will bud

She had niet with much of kindaess and sympathy.
The old companions of -her father-brethren of the craft-
all knew of her patient endurance Andworth, and had so
exerted themsel res that she was never without emiployment
in the business of diessbiaking which she now, followed.
The ladies for whoan she,-worked frequently became
interested in and oftentimes efleiently assisted her in,
many ways ; and the noble 'fIlial heroism which her life
displayed reflected back upon theme an influence for good,,
which now and 'then came -to the :girl's knowledge, causing
her cheeks to glow and her heart to beat with gratitude.
Their home ;wasremoved from where we left them.
They now occupied the third story of a house- in: a clean!
though humble street, with the privilege of " Miss West"
seeing visitors on business in the front parlour on the first
floor, and the advantage of having placed on the window"
shutter a lettered sign with her name, and appended.
thereto "Fashionable -Dress Maker."  There were three
rooms on their third floor. One large one back,in which.
they lived and ate; and two smaller onefin front-which
gave a chamber, for herself whte' she in warm weather
sewed, and the- other was a sleeping room for her father,.
in which the old , an when incapacitated for going out,
remained until he became sober.

Of all thedutiest  devolved upon the daughter the

the saloon opened, 'and three young men'dressed in'the then

degree intoxicated. Heavy watch-chains hung over their

was worn a huge signet ring. Their breaths were hot with

faith of the woman, whose heart was breaking, looked upon

His power that kept ever flowing in the hear-t of the disap-
pointed man, the "'well spring" of his early loveand made
it gush a healthful stream;-for in itA mirrored surface were
pietured onlyr pleasant scenes of early life to cheer his
lonely lot, and along its sides amid leaves of perennial
greenness,looked out violets and Forget Me Nots--a bunch
of which the young girl had given him one summer-night
long ago!-and ever after these flowers were to him but
semblances of Lucy Ashton's sweet blue eyes.
Lucy was born in the village where Daniel Brown
lived; and 'as far back as she could remember. he was
always "a grown up young man." She had ever regarded
him as one of her kindest and best friends, and felt towards
him as a sister to an older brother. A strong friendship
grew with her growth on her part towards him, and that
afternoon she told him, all blushing and in whispers, in the
old woods in which they oftentimes walked-where the
trees seemed giants sprung up out of the. earth to bow
their tall green heads in worship when veiled by the storm-
cloud, or to whisper praises in low rustling tones as zephyrs
swept among their canopy of leaves-of her intended
marriage with Joseph West, the handsome intelligent
young printer, she could not understand the reason of the
'sudden paleness and the pained-look which so changed the
expression of W4 kind, honest face. She never knew that

pain of whichcould only be assuaged by thoughts of her
own innocent loveliness*
The man, at length, determined to return and look
again upon the face that to hia had been as a dream of
heaven 1-a weary interval of years had gone by since he had
last heard of the printed's family ;-and he turned his foot-
steps eastward. When he reached Philadelphia Mrs. West
had long been buried. The hunter visited the home of the,
girl and her father, and he thought his heart would rise up
in his throat and choke him when he saw its destitution and
wretchedness. He resolved at once for the mother's sake,
to watch over her child as long as he lived; and, collecting.
some small means togetherihe opened a grocery store in
that city. So guileless had his long communion with
Nature made him, that he was unfitted to compete with the
craft and business-cunning of othersi- the trade, and the
profits of his business,,hard, as he worked at it, scarcely
yielded him a support.., His great object however was
attained, he saw- that sdbe never wanted. Basket,, after
basket-full, of necessary.articles, was, time and again, left
at Mr. West's; and when remonstrated with, he always
told "his child Lizie,"---for thus would he now call
her, that "there was a long unsettled account against him
between her mother and himself which he feared he never
could pay ; and that he was only trying to 'keep down
the interest." Lizzie believed this to be some sort of a kind
snbtezuge, and the old man grew into her heart a kindly
object to venerate and love.
The three were -now ready to start. $. West walked
in the middle with his arm inserted-within Mr. thrown's,

and his-daughter stationed herself on the 'other side -ready
to render assistance in getting her father along  The streets
were almost deserted. They soon passed into Pine Street
and walked.along it uotil they came to Ninth, up he west-
side of which ,they turned. The point they wished to
reach was a court running alongside of St. ephen's church
in Tenth Street below Market. None of them seemed
disposed to talk, The Walnut Street Theatre was out, and
Miss West felt an inward gratulation that they would not
be exposed to the rude gaze of its frequenters. -Before she
.was aware of it, however,-they were mixed up with a crowd
hanging around the deor of the splendid mansion on the
corner of Chestnut and Ninth Streets.
It was the evening of a magnificent fete. The line
of carriages extended some distance up -Chestnut Street on
both sides of the way. As some of the guests were now
going home,a glimpse of them was afforded to the bystanders
as they came -down the steps and got into their carriages.
Th6 two woIld immediately have crossed over to the other
side of the street, and thus have gotten out of the crowd,
but Mr. West in an obstinate tone, said: 'dHe would 'nt
budge until he had seen some of the nobs go home!" He.
was deaf to their entreaties and declared again,in a louder
voice, hi aetermination  To avoid an altercation, and as
the IeAt of two evils,they thought it best to -gratify him ;

out of the line aid- drove up ;t the marble stone, jus in
front of the house. A footman got down fron behind and
opening its door let down the steps. The inner door of
the hall, swun  open at the same time, and a group, two
ladies with shawls i their hands attended by a gentleman,
,stepped onto the vestibule.
One of the ladies was elderly, and her stately form not
yet decrepid with age, was robed in black sati and lace.
On her*head was a cap of snowy whiteness with a trimmig
of light wavy feather, and her silver hair, i a few natural
curls, shaded her sweet venerable face. The other was
young, and dressed in pink tarleton of Maany skirts' which
floated All around herm rosy haziness. In her hair was a
wreath of whiteIoses, and a cross. of diamonds rested on
her breast. Eer hair and eyes were dark, an  e flash of
the diamonds was not brighter than that ef her brilliant
eyes.
The young lady discovering she had forgotten her
boquette turned to the gentleman and said,; Oh, Mr .Ran-
gIolph, please go back and get my flowers. They are in the
ladies' dressing-room. I remember laying them on the

She glanced haughtily at the crowd on the pavement
ranged on each side of the door,untilher eyes rested upon
Miss West and her father; and, as if by-sometalismanic
spell, the gaze of the two girls rivetted, ead upon theother.

both, the memory of another.scene,, A gtrr side-a far

off, our fair heroine.
Mrs. Randolph also had been attracted by the sight of
the girl standing aon the motley group, and she sighed in
her inmost heart over the fate of the poor street-walker ;-

her reception 3ut the elysian period of her life was the,
time she spent, eachyear, with her darling boy at the north,
and they two, when together, built many a cloud Castle in
Spain, looking towards. the, time when he should have
attained such a position in the profession in which he was
struggling-thatof the law-as would enable them to have
again a home of their own.
Ten  ears,  stated,  had elapsed sinbe the time our
Narrative coimenced, and I must now ask my readers to
go with me into a low drinking-saloon of Philadelphia.
It is in a cellar and the neigbourhood "down town."  The
floor is sanded. The chairs andtables, with half.the paint
worn p1; areo cut and dilapidated The company is such as
yonmight expect to see: forthe most part miserably poor,
andif giut so, sadly depraved. At a table sat Mr. West,
seeming ahnst imbecile but for the eager, covetous looks
with which he regarded the decanters ranged on a shelf
behindthbare-madthe contents of which he had neither
the moneynor rit to buy    The liquor sold here, gener-
aIly, was of a vile sort; drugged t suit the morbid, thirsty

throats f veteran drinkbrs,.whose   constitution were
additionally poisoned by each draught they swallowed.
There were men, single and in groups, oattprgd in
various patof the saloon, which was; longad  xteaded
back~ It was a chilly evening out of doors, for a dense fog
had hung around all day ; adt wasabotfor o'4o     in
the afternoon. There were a few jets of  asJighted, here
and there, bnt gloom was the characteristi pfthe apart-
ment-and the, shuffling, staggering figures lopmed o14
obscurely into huge shapes Qf wretchedness.
From a private box, before which a curtain had been
drawn, walked out two men. They had beenengged for
a long time, within in a whispered Aconyersat~in, and ox' the
table they had left,stood glasses, and an empty ecanter-w
besides several plates onwhich oysters.had been aerved.
One of them was quite young-flashy-looking, with a
sensual countenance and a swaggering air, which, for the
moment, seemed somewhat subdued. The other was about
forty-five years old and on his marked face was expressed
evil, passions. and vice. H e had the look of a hard,
resolute, bad man; of dark complexion and a. heavy beard.
Therewas a sinister glance of intelligence in his black eyes
that overawed and betokened power, and was calculated, to
abash those he designed to inRuence and with whom he
talked.
The latter wentup to the counter a  taking a handful
of silver from his pocket placed on it a couple of half-dollars
to settle the billat the same time looking around searchingly
at the different person in the room. The . younger walked
upto the stove and stood before  with a troubled, irreso-

lute. air, which he attempted to coneel by whistling a
lively tune.
After the change was pocketed, the lider approached
his coipanion and laying his hand on his shoulder, said to
him in a 'low toe  glancing qicly towards Mr. West':
Charley, my man that old fellow there, will Uit s exactly

'He started, and looked suppheatingly into the fae
that regarded him with an unpitying look, and said:
"Oh Reviere do nt-not now-wait few days longer I"
"The air is dhlly and it has affeeted your nerves,
boy ! You want something t warm you. Come take
another drink "then turning, and bowing towards Mr.
West, he inteogatively remained in a loud enough tone to
be heard by him-"You 'will perhaps, Sir, do us the favor
to drink withil-'
The words'eore sarcely spoken before the old man
ansebed, "AYes, thank yoi;" and quky walked toaards

Revier-e bent his head close down to the ear of the
other, and whispered:-"The very man, Charley.I

A  ohee men went upto the counter and hquor was
ptred by' Retoiere into each of there glasses. As they were
raimg them   o thei lips he said:-" Gentlemen, Ihave
a tat to propose for the beneftt of 'our young friend;"
looking towards Charley-" it is," success to his enterprise!P"

THE PRINTER'       DAUGHTER.
"Well, let us. drink it!" was the reply of old West,
rap ily draining his glass, and looking angiously at the
disappearing bottle which the attendant was putingback
upon the shelf- At a gesture from Reviere it was however
replaced withiit their reach, and pouring out a largo
quantity into the emptied tumbler, he sd:-" My dear Sir
you drank my toast with such hearty good-mill that I nust
not only thank you, but beg that you will again drink
success to our young friend.'" Nothing loth, it was a second
time emptied -while Reviere's first glss just touched
his lips, and Charley's had been merely tested
Perhaps, as you ,have seen much of the world, and
are a man of experience -.--continued the tempter, addres-
sing Mr. West in a deferential manner:-"you would be
willing to aid us by your advice. Our friend is young-
and I "-he hesitated; and a shadow rested for a moment
upon his countenance, as his youth-time like a ghost came
back to visit him ;-but, soon, his face grew even sterner
than it was before, and his voice, if possible, seemed a shade
blander in its tones, as he continued:--" Lalways respect
the wisdom of grey-hairs." Then, turning to the attendant
at the bar, he said: "Will you'be kind enough to give us
a bottle of your very best-.with glasses for three-and in
a box where we may be entirely private?"
The order was obeyed with alacrity, and in. .few
minutes, Charleyand his friend were seated on oneside, and
Mr. West on the other, of a box table. The curtain was
shut to, and the jet of -gas withinside was lighted. A
bottle and glasses were before them and within convenient
reach of the party.


Liquor was again   poured out-and some of it
drank by Mr. West,.-when Reviere reniarked :-"Our
filed 'here, igvery desirous t visit again the house
in which Ihe was born andwhere, until latly, he lived-.

sneer-" Poor fellowi- he takes it hardt"'-tien, changing
his tone quickly, he said: "My dear Sir, you are no longer
thirsty, J-see: "-.-and pushed the bottle across the table.
"Wheie is the 'house into which he is so anxious to
get ?" asked the old man, who, with an steady hand,
pouredout some' more liquor.
j'It is in Chestnut Street, a few doors from Schuylkill
Eighthon the sgth sideof the way-"-and is a very hand-

"WhereMrs Van Osten lives '?he again asked, as a
gleam of cunning played for' moment .about his imbecile
features.
"Yes.   Do'you know the hwse? "
" My daughter sews there sometimes. She is at work
for her this afternoon."
This senteitious reply fell'like a bomb-shell into the
council--and there was'a p4se;r-egoh heard the breathing
of the Qthez. Charley half lifted up his head and looked
furtivelyt one, and then at the other face near him-
Revieretat length broke the silence, and in a very low tone
said: " Could 'nt you manage to call upon your daughter

-Mr. West, thought for: a little while-and then
stretching out his trembling fingers clutched  at the
gold, which, as he touched it, seemed 'to impart strength
to his purpose, while his lips moved, and the two caught
at the faint sounds which were breathed rather than
spoken-" I'll do it!"  The three tumblers were then
drained as a seal to the compact.
As six   o'clock T. M., struck, Mr. West stoo l at

ON that same foggy afternoon to which I have alluded
-and also ab6ut four o'clock-there sat in a large pleasant
chamber, beside a Fraiklin stove, in which a bright fie
was burning, old Nii's. Randolph. A  nll table, covered
wi Jh bright worsteds, stood i front of the large 'arm-chair
she occupiede-one of that bi 6ld-fashioned ind stufed
so snugly that you could fall asleep in it; and fancy your-
self in bed ;-and so capacious, that in just' such many a
little baby is said to hav  narrowly escaped being crushed-
to death as it was laid upon the seat to kick and stretch its
'limbs, by 'the sitting down of an incautious visitor- who
did not'carr y.eyes behind 'as well as- i front. She was
introducing into some beautiful form of rotchet-work the
various coloured threads before her,' intending it as a.
simple bridal-gift for the orphan niece of the rich Mrs..
Van''Osten, whos9 niajagrie was t tike place in a fe4 days
and as whose bridesmaid Miss Padelford was to officiate,
attended upon by her son, Theodore.


AI- ZI X, WJT;
The old lady was little changed since the time, three
years ago, she was first presented to our readers. She
looked up occasionally at the mantel clock to see how time
progressed-for, when not engaged in court-business, her
son always spent an hour or two with her after dinner.
His boarding-house was close to his office and, although
not living in the'same house whee his mother visited, he
did all that affectioniate solicitide coild, to make her sojourn
as pleasant as possible.
Her,ear caught his well kown- atep on the staira, and,
with a iad smile she bade hirn terxas ie tlyr trnocked
at the door. There had ,bethilieady a chair which she
knew he loved to sit iun placed for him. near her side and
pleasantly situated as regarded the ire. Oh how delightful
to both of them eeemed the little race of time they were
Ito spend together l alone by themselves.
An hour f eQnversatiengassed as a few minutes, and
he told her of several new ases le had in hand, and which
hp hoped to gain, and how he was going to manage them;
and she listened and thought " how sensible he was;" an
"9 what an ornament he would be to his profession, and ho
-some day he would be looked up to and respected!"  nd
then, the old longing for the time to come when they tw
eould, in one home, live always together, came back upon
hr poor heart so that she could scarcely keep from weeping.
And, as she ganced up at -his face, it seemed to her he
looked paler and thinner than he used to   4. "Oh itdoes
take a long while for a young lawyer to make his way in
his professionI ".-and an involuntary sigh escaped, audibly
from her heart.

"at least, not just now."
Mischievously smiling,; and with a dash of sarcasm in
her voice,: she said' "Well1 that is complimentary at any
rate'! I am rather surprised at :my own amiability in keeping
in good humour"
"I have always found you amiable and very kind to,
me, Miss Padelford,".-he replied with feeling--" and I did'
not mean tobe rue ; "--she bent her head forward so as-
to catch every intonation of his voiefor she almost began
to hope that hewould utter words- that her heart had
longed, for years, to hear :-" and, I am, now going to tell
you about a marriage that may take place, which most of
the' world would, not' think- a very delightful one in
expectancy."--There was a pause-which was embarrassing
to both, and she strove to"rally herself to break it by some.
light renark but -she could not ;-+for his face looked too
sadly earnest, and she herself felt that, smehow, she was
interested in what further' was to be said. He continued
"It is that of a poor girl,.,without, a mother, and
whose father is one' of the most miserable of mwen, a
drunkard who 'broke hiswife's heart,, and has kept his
child chained down to poverty because she would still cling
to, him.'! Angelina trqmled !-hke now guessed all that
was not yet told:-"And the man is a poorproud young

uttered witha forced distictness,-" A pretty little romance
sir! I remember well the'night-" andithout knowing
it, her face and voice expressed, jeering look and tone, as
she- added-" And the -girl! too." Firmly compressing
her lips, her eyelids rapidly moving up and down, for the
tears seemed determitied to start; she continued, in the
same Ifreezing accents,- I cannot but feel grateful in
having been made your confidant in so important a
At that moment a servant came into the room to say,
"That a boy at the door was asking for Mr. Randolph, and
wanted to see him immediately on urgent business."
Miss Padelford arose, and with a profound courtesy
bade him  "Goodnight;"-and hoped "soon to be able
to congratulate him on-his successin the court of Cupid!"
But, when he had left the apartment, she pressed her hand
heavily against her heart, and almost fainting, sank back
upon the sofa.
Reviere had told the truth to Mr. West so far as the
fact was concerned that the house where Mrs. Van Osten
lived was the one which had been, until lately, Charley's
home. His father, a shipping merchant ih large business

him, and he presedhis face lose down'into one of the cush.
ions that lay:uponthe sofa.
Reviere took froni his p6ket a arkilantern which he
lighted, and ,then abur  of keys with some strange
looking instr ments.
"Here,I Jwill want youto 'hold this,  wlgile'I pick,
-the sideboard4oak ' and he -eldh oitthe lantern towards
Charley, who got ufind.did- as he was bidden.
The sideboatd sa inthe-back parlour andthe' folding
doors between the tw-roonis had been left half-open. With-
out ffnving them further they went into that room. A
number of pieces of plate were set out upon it :-two
'arge silver pitchers several cake baskets, and a whole tea-
set which was arranged on a massive'waiter,-all of 'which
were chased elaborately.  As Reviere's eyes glanced
over the  display, he sarcastically muttered,  It is a
pitygthey took somuch troubleto ornament them as they
will soon be melted up !' --The solid stuff is what we want ;"
and,turning to his companion, he added-" But-let us get the
little things out first. Holdthe light justdso I' Being obeyed,
with a dextrous hand the door-lock was soon overcome.
The capacious closet underneath revealed dozen after
dozen of spoons and forks, among which, conspicuously ar-
ranged in a cut-glass receiver, was.a dozen and a half solid
gold tea-spoons. .At the sight of these Reviere: uttered a
suppressed exclamation of joy, immediately secreting
them upon his own person. . They then commenepd' packing
the articles in baskets, several of which were procu-ed from
the closet which had been Charley's hiding place. They

walked about softly as mice,  taiting at every noise
they made ;--and Reviere, at the least rattling of the- pre-
cious ware, cursing every now and then in an underbreath,
the "jingling things! "
Their plan was to get off through the back-door and
the yard into George Street--and be away with'their booty.
Thelast basket was filled, and Reviee was lifting the huge
waiter cautiously from the sideboard, when Oharleyi with a
face paleal death, cried out, "Look there! oh !-oh!--"
pointing towards the other parlour,' where, between the
folding doors, stAod Mrs. Van Osten in her night-dress,
looking undismayed at-the two burglars. She was leaning
on her cane: and now, raising it, said, "Sirs,-that property
is not yours that you are disturbing! " There was not'a
tremble in her voice, and-it sounded' out clear and distinct
upon the dead silence of the' night.
Reviere himself was for' the momerit dismayed, and
Charley cowered back into a corner of the room unable to
stand. But the former, recovering himself, looked up
towards' her defiantly, and replied --" But it shall be, old
woman, despite of all that you can do!"
"No: "-and she shook her 'head solemnly-"it shall
not be! unless you walk over my dead body., Murder is
a dreadful thing ;-even if it be that of a grey head."
Reviere, menacingly, approached her. But she stood
unmoved as a rook, and when within almost arm's reach of
her he stopped: "Iwill have that booty,or I will be--
and a knife gleamed in ,his hand as he drew it from-his
bosom to strike at her:, while she, with her cane, feebly
parried the blow. A howl!-a leap in the air !--followed

When Mr, West and his dau hte start fr home
from Mrs    aOsten's door they both felt0sad -At heart.
She was not long I observiug that something unusual was
on the old man's mind. He was restlessand Wpq1d walk
on a-head of her  d ad then look furtively behind him as
she came up as if afraid of pursuit. She 4did ot know what
it meant and. feared she knew not what calamity was in
store for them.. His calling to for her was unusual, but
she did not like to ask him, Wi he had dome? fearing
to hurt his feelings,; and that he might suppose she was
mortified at his having done so.
She was. anxious too, about her other father, old Mr.
Brown.,  Le had been sick the greater part of the agnmer
and did not appear to be getting any better but much
weaker, as the cool weather came on. She had not seen
him for several days and thought that to night,'after tea, she
would certainly: att him. When they got-home she found
a message for her stating that he "was very mich worse,
and that he wanted to se her as, soon apoggil
Rapidly preparing her father's supper, she tArted for
his house, but had scarcely walked the length of a square
when she heard some ontealling at der, and,4urnig
round, saw through the fog Mr. West rapidly following.

chill.
,I did not think, father,-you wanted to go oi.tagain to

not afraid of the damp-? You" are trembling now with the
cold."

teethehaittered'o that'he ckuld scarcely get out the words.
Again he lokedaround himn apprehensively.

exercise will warm you:"-she'took hold of his rm and
they hiriied'n at a quick pace.
When the' arrived at Mr. Brown's they found him,
indeed, very ill. He was propped up in bed-his face was
nearly as white as the pillows upoi which he ested. Miss
West saw at.aAglance that his 'hours were numbered: 'Oh!
how desolate, would she be without him. With a composed
face, however, she came up t the bedside, and 'said, "My
cear friend,why did I not know sooner you were worse?
My first duty would have been to attend pn you."
" Know it, Lucy--Linie I ieau- bit 'Mrs. Davis has

opened the door and came in after her. he motiqned him
to a seat, and, making a strenuous effort, said
" Mr. Randolph, I have something very dreadful to tll

is to be attempted to night at Mrs. Van Osten's,. Can it
not be frustrated?"

to the dismayed-looking man, "you will have to go with

The old man's alarm. at the proposition was so mani-
fest that Randolph found it would be necessary to quiet his
apprehensions; and he endeavored to .do ,so, although he
disliked, before the daughter, to =evince any suspicion of
her father's complicity with the felony.. He said to-him, in
that calm "sort of tone which carries so iueh force along
with it.-It is imperative that you'go along. No possible
harm can happen-to you if you do. Much harm may be
consequent upon your not going, and refusing to assist me
by givingall the information you possess. Will get my hat
at once. -There is a large old cloak lying alongside the bed,
up-stairs, which you had best wrap around you, for the
night is very damp and chilly."
In a few minutes the noisy vehicle in which sat the two
men was waking up restless sleepers all along the-line-of
its travel to the police station nearest to the house of Mrs.
Van Osten.
It did not take Theodore-Randolph long to get at all

the end of their ride he was enabled to make such a state-

officer who knew, where Charley was hiding, and 'whom
they had promised to meet.

and then cautiously made his wAy qut,,Of jt, and the back
street, into a more public one. He trembled :at every foot-
step -that approached hint Hj stopped once in at a baker's
and got some rolls of bread, for he was faint with hunger.
After he had eaten them he came againinto the street, but
he did not know where to go. -'Oh, how, thirsty he was!-
heMustget something to drink ;.-and he went in at a
tavern- door, which stood on the corner just before him.
Each; act--and almost eachmotive that influenced .him-.
was noted by the watchful eye of the man who, himself
all unobserved, was on his track.
It wasonUtside this tavern that they now found the
policeman, apparently lounging away his timo and going
every now and then into the bar room to look over the,
newspapers, or to take a drink with a friend. They
beckoid to'himf as-they drove up and conferred together for
a few mothents. He said, "Charley was inside, looking

immediately to the carriage, the door ofwhich would be

themselves, as if to get something, and he was to com  in
after them. They would join him and the prisoner in the
carriage afterwards, and drive together to the, house
of 1rs. Van Osten.",
They went in 'nd walked up to the;bar. Charley was
sitting on a ,tool with a Pewspaper hewas not reading,
before him., He started when the door opened and looked
as if he was going to run. A minute afterwards another
door, which was on the side of the room, was opened by the
officer who walked straight up to him. The young man fied
his eyes on him with a horrified gaze, and they dilated wider
in terror, as he approached. The man held out the warrant
and said, In a low voice, "Charles Wood, I.arrest you in
the name of the Commonwealth." He sprang up, upsetting
the stool on which he had been sittingdeaped upn its legs
as it lay horizontally on the floor, and brandished a stick in
his hand, which he had caught at, as if in defence, It was
but a momentary ebullition. 'e then sank down overcome
on a seat, aid, -leaning his head upon a table, gave himself
up to utter despair.
It was all over so soon, that an hour' had nt passed
from the time- they had left Mrs. Van Osten's before th
were back again. The guilty man could scarcely get up the
steps-- his knees smote together under himand he looked
unutterably wretched.

In the little back room, with its low ceiling and home-

the reading of the will of Mr. Brown. Old Mrs. Ran-.

"The Lottery Ticket, or The Forlorn [ope ;" is in our judgment,
after a perusal of the proof sheets, the title of one of the, most captivating
and affecting stories we have ever read. We have to thank its talented
author not only for the intellectual and sentimental treat which he has fur-
nished us; but more especially, because more important, for the contribu-
tion to sound public anorals, which the work affords. Son of the scenes
of harrowing poverty and anguish will touch the heart and draw the test
from all who sympathize with the sufferings andaorrqws of the poor,though
increased, in this instance, ten-fold, by that foul and pernicious spirit of
lottery gambling, which is here laid bare, while the hypocrisy and sancti-
monious pretensions of, the heartless speculator in the sufferings of others,
and the brilliant episodes of extravagance and fashion, mark this as one of
the most dramatic and effective books of the day. Philadelphia Topic.
Qamden Democrat.
We have read this recent publication twice, and with the deepest
interest. The descriptions are graphic; the language of the book excel-
lent; and the whole story powerful in expression and full of pathos. The
author is not unknown to the world of letters; and has told a touching
lastt too true) story, an4 one that will be remembered by every reader
for its sorrowful truth, and its beautiful delineation of the gentler shades
of character.
Let every reader of the Democrat buy this book, and he will not accuse
us of exaggerating in its praise.

The   following   noticee  of   " THE   LOTTERY     TwKET"
was received     by  its publisher     from   DOCTOR    REYNELL
COATES, 4 short time After the iSue of the first edition
of the work:
"The downward tendency of that species of literature, if such it can
be called, with which, in shilling or two, shilling doses, the masses of
American readers are now continually flooded awakens keen regret in the
minds of all the true friends of society. - Not a few philanthopists would be
glad to see it altogether suppressed, in view of the 'terrible demoralization
of whichit is the parent; but, this is impossible. The insatiable appe-
tite of twenty prolific millions wid be gratified, and, in the absence of
healthful food, will seize upon the poisons.  Reform, then, difficult as it
may be, not destruction, should be the object of those who would correct
the. evil. * This consideration has. given to,:this unpretending story an
importance in our eyes, to Which, otherwise, it m eight not. have attained.,
While utterly' divested of objectionablee thouglht'or description, it enchains
the attention and aiouses the sympathies of the Romance reader to an
extent that must render it highly popular, and we are not'surprised that a
second editioli follows the first after an interval of a very few- days. , The
tale presents a deeply affecting picture of domestic distress and ruin, resulting
from one of the worst curses of society, and the principal incidents, while
sternly truthful are rendered startling and dramatic to a degree that fully
warrants the proud nom de plume which the author has seen fit to assume.
The moral 1is0mostexcellent, and the tendency practical so that we hope
to see it followed by miny other stories from the same able pen, and cheer-
fully, recommend i1830o the real friends of their species, as a pioneer in the
important work of rendering that .most powerful lever, popular romance,
an instrument of moral advancement instead of degradation."

THE CHRISTIAN OnszRvzn, or PHILA., says of it :-" In a very inter-
esting story of some ninety pages' handsomely printed in large type the
author delineates the pernicious effects of th  system of lotteries which, in
defiance of law, are destroying the peace of many families in every part of
the country. * * * *  It is highly commended by literary critics.
THE DoLLAR NEWSPAPER says :--" The Lottery Ticket; or, the For-
lorn Hope, by Paul Richter, is the title of a pamphlet volume covering
an interesting and affecting story of the times, the whole .being liberally
illustrated. The author has.a good purpose in view, and if he shall sge-
coed in winning over any of the many confirmed lottery gamblers, -he will
not have written without his reward; for of all crimes not openly con-
demned, this is the most seductive and impoverishing."
THE SUNDAY DISPATcH says ;-" The Lottery Ticket; or, the Forlorn
Hope, by Paul Richter.    We have in this story an interesting and
most excellent contribution to good morals and pure literature. The
evils of gambling in lotteries are set forth in a style which is calculated to
highly interest the reader, to ,affect the better sympathies, and to have an
influence upoi the better resolutions of those who may be tempted to give
way to a fascination which, with many weak minds, seems irresistible.
The author has presented some painful and affecting pictures in the course
of the story.  His command of.language is perfect, and the style is chaste
and appropriate. 'The Lottery Ticket ' will take rank among the best
of modern tales, and we commend it heartily to general attention."

Ten persons engagbd in thle sale of lottery tickets were arrested in
Cincinnati, Ohio, lately. 'The Gazette says :-The affidavits upon which
warrants were issued for these parties were all made by Frederick Toden-
bier, a German mechanic, who relates his experience in the lottery business
with emotions  He says he has been purchasing tickets for years-that
he has spent all he earned, and all he could borrow, in these ruinous
speculations-that he has impoverished himself and family to such a degree
that they have frequently had to live upon a single meal a day, and that of
the most scanty character; in short, that he had become almost a maniac
upon the subject of drawing a prize, and at last getting his hard-earned
money back.  He has been driven to the verge of despair and destruction,
and having become convinced of the wide-spread ruin which the lottery
business is inflicting upon the community, is determined to do his utmost
to break it up. Todenbier assures the officers that there is at least a
hundred within the circle of his own acquaintance, who are daily spending

UNITED STATES' GAZETTE AND NouTH AmERoiAN.       "A young man,
named Benneville Kline, in the employ of a broker in this city, was
arrested in-the Office of Blood's Dispatch, in Fifth. Street, above Chestnut.
The arrest was made upon a warrant issued by the Mayor. A large num-
ber of letters directed to the employer of the latter were seized. The
youth and the letters were taken before Alderman James B. Freeman,
where the prisoner underwent an examination, and the letters were opened.
It seems that the young man, who was .arrested, was in the employ of a
certain firm in this city, and that the said firm is heavily engaged in the
sale of tickets for the Delaware and Maryland Lotteries. The correspond-
ence between the firm and its agents has been carried on through the
medium of Blood's Dispatch, and the returns from these agents were in
the letters seized, as above stated.  *  *  *    Some of the letters
had attached to them the autographs of members of the bar; and others,
who would not like to see their names figure in print in connection with
the vending of lottery tickets.  *  *    *    *     Michael Kline,
the father, was subsequently arrested at his office, in Race Street, above
Third. They were held in $2000 bail each to answer. The principals in
the business are not yet taken.
