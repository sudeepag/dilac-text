4 ' 7Frank ;'Fanli; this is klllizrg me. Night
after night--iorning after; thorning; peni-
lea-foodless !" The poor widow shudder-
ed, and walked about more hastily, as if to
shut out a horrid image ; while broken pray-
ers stele over her lips.
4 At last she -listened with intense eager-
Mess to one step she was certain she knew.
It had the cadence, although an uncertain
one, of Frank's foot. It stumbled up tothe
door ; the knock was heard, and she-crept
softly up-stairs to light him in and to assist
4 him down stairs.
4 He reeled into the kitchen, and flungbim-
self,"with sullen visage, into a chair; his
dress was-disordered, and his features were
heavy and Inflamed, while the eyes were full
of blood'; and as the mother gazed in silence
upon him, she wrung her hands with at any
gnish'sopoignant, that it appeared' as if she
would have knelt at his feet and there, with
a heart all splitting, have died!
That same night Frank had been the life
end the soul of boon' party, and his vice
and laugh were loudest of all,-every fae
alty hac been excited-every idea'had been
bared ; be had amused his comanions with
flashes of merriment, and 'mad, equivocal

mirth ; and now--now he was like an ex-
ploded shell; nothing he was, as it were,
dead; his'whole electric fire had gone out;
he was utterly collapsed, with ndithet soul
nor thought, apd his brain had no further
coining. No word was spoken, but his
mother gazed furtively upon him as she
pressed the little s':pper close to him, and
looked in blank silence upon the fearful
wreck of her only child.
While he was'eating it, ahd'by tarts fall-
ing ibto a' moody reverie,withotrf one single
thought far her, the mother's imagination
seized one idea. fed upoh it, dtined it,
drank and exhausted it, till liervery sul

younger days ; she was happy, then, for the

shape flitting and. dancing before me?" .he
muttered, as he atteuiped to gaze straight
before him. "Very I strange very.strange I"
and so, with such disjointed fragments, he
reached his mother's door..
He knocked softly--there was a light
flickering through the kitchen shutters,-he
knocked again : the cold was dreadful, and
he was ,impatient to get in, but no one
came. "It was singular," he thought.
"She must have fallen asleep :" and there
pealed " three" in the morning from the
gray steeple.
He stooped down, and' touched the win-
4dy-shutter without-it was unfastened-
he drew it back, and opening the window,
got in and reclosed it, and then with a thrill
gf fear lhp began tolook round him.
The light was on the table, and the sup.
per was laid :as:usual,' but the ire was out
and his mother sat in; an old chair. She
slept very soundly,, for she moved not-
stirred not.;
'Hle did not go near her, but stood gazing
upon her., x Hewas almost sobered by an in-
definable aawe-a cold fear that crept oler
him: she looked 'so venerable as ,she sat-
for the wrinkled featureswere smoothed into
a solemn calm,; The eyes werp closed and
the head slightly beat. A strsgglin lock or
two of grey ibair'bad escaped ffoth beneath
her cap, and the wind blew it about ber
cheek.' The 'thin hands,..where every vein
Andsmusolewere prominent, wre clasped

swelled, and teals stole into~bis eyes,
fie took the light and looked into the
cupboard ; every dish was empty, every
plate cleared. There, was' no bread-no
food of any kind but his supper on, the ta-
ble. No bread I How then had his mother
lived.?  For the first time he gave it a
thought, and his heart seemed crushed with
a weight he could not endure: he gasped
for breath;.hle panted-phantoma passed
before his eyes ; first all smiling ; at last, all
grinning hideouslyI     ,
Her head, as we have said, was bent ; but
in her bands he detected an object that had
missed his gaze. He approached, in order
to look upon it nearer,--it was a little lock
of golden hair ; his own! A tear had frozen
on her cheeks ; she was cold-for he touched
her hand ; she was calm ; very calm-she
was dead ! Cold, and hunger, and weari-
ness of life, togetherwith abandonment of
all hope, had done their work!I
He may cry ifTbe will, unavailingly, out
of his great anguish as the poet did:-
' Oh I that those isp, tiad language."
But. they were closed for ever, never more
to speak to him  with endearing. words-
never to pray and to beseech him to beware
of the witcheries of drunkenness ; never to
kiss his own white lips and ashy cheeks t
never to move more.
Two or three years went by. and Frani
Wildeyg, who now lived with his wife in a
wretched room, had only sank lower and
lower in the scale of society. For a long
time the father'of his wife had refused to
take hyp4 of either of them. The wrathfal
man had driven poor Frances forth, and
cursed ler for her clandestine marriage ;
but softened by her sorrow and distress,he
had at lest relented so:far as to give her a
trifle of money now and then, which, with'
th needlework she had obtained, helped to
buy their bread,' though the' greater part

"Wiat do you mean ?" demanded he, in
a: ferce tone ; "and what do they. say."

every hideous particular,;. and while his
conscience told him that. the fearful accusa-

starting up with flaming eyes and clenched

she spoke to one deaf as aanadder. Sh9
spoke to one whose, heart was callous and
barpened ; she spoke to one who now
found a fiendish pleasure ,in pursuing his
point; for he saw thatit was gnawing her
to the very heart,.

She'did not wait the completion of the

no longer--the bundle was made up.
- "Now," said he, "place it under your
arm. and then to the ' pawnbroker; I will
bring the brat with me. Be quick 1"
Putting on her' miserable bonnet and'her
little'scanty shawl, with a heart sick to
death, and with a face all pale and ghastly,
she descended the stairs, while Frank fol-
lowed, 'dragging, rather than leading his
child by the hand.
S'Out of one of the leading and crowded
thoroughfards there stood a court, and at
the corner of this part was a small door,
which was so formed 1 as to elude public ob-
ervation;-while °at:the same tine is was well
known that this was the entrance into the
patvnbroker's shop.

with an "expression 'of wonder ' And "fear,
while the wife went into the shop, he began
torevoive anny projects In his own mind :
but even while a glow 'of satisfaction at the
bamillatlon he was{ thus inflicting on his

sentiment of some coming evil fell-upon
him, wdlmsand vague misgiving-of advane-
lag knischief. If he bya premature cruelty
maimed his right hand-Ahat'is tosay, If he

He started ; but as be got into the pas,

butliike Mudge. A glance of' mutual r-
cognition ensued ; but Mudge evidently did
not wish td drawiupon him the wife's as-
tention.
Prahk planed a few shillings " into her
hand, and pushing the child roughly to her,
bade her to go home ; and then darting
round the coxner was soon seated with his
friend in deep and earnest conversation in
the private parlor of a low tavern.

up his voice he tried in a atoneying tone.
" Wot, Frank, and is this rely you ?"
" What do you mean by asking that?"
demanded Frank, somewhat angrily.

reader, that upon the whole, and after ma.

sue our theme.

" No," answered Frank : ita fastened

against the dead.

Mudge continued : " I went to your house

looking at his hand and bony wrists, "but
Id have thrown youdown the stairs, orout'

"'Would you, though ?" muttered Frank,
rebelliously, and somewhat valiantly, for
thy contenptuous manner of. this strange
being was beginning, to grow unbearable.
" We should have aeen about that."
" Very true, so we would," assented
Mike. "Well, I lifted up the woman,- and

" you don't care much about her, do
you ?"
"No. Care l.no," cried Frank.
"Then you won't m'ss her when you go

cried the husband.

One. landing iafty the ether was passed,
until Frank, ..wearied with the journey,
asked "if they had not already gone
through the rogf,,and were, getting into the

stopped at a door on the highest landing,

no little curiosity began to look about him.

and :now as you've set up in business, you'll
be forced to do the samie, or elseshare
mine." '
'" Ah t well,' we shall see about that,"
replied Frank, tiieaily; for he did not
like the alltsidt to'"business," and wished
to drive it from his'reniembr-nce as far as
he could. Once more, therefore, he applied
to the spirits, of which he drank copiously.
"Now,"   aid- Mudge, when' their meal
was over, "let's have a look at the plunder."
He then took several'articles' out of -his
pocket and 'paced Them dri' the' table.-
There was a valuable gold watch,' a dka
mond bracelet, se'eral'articles o'f jevellery,
and gold and 'Banknotes to a oerisiderable
amount.   "There's 'a  hundred 'a-piece
here," inutteredl Mudge, "'if there's' a
penny.'
Frank's eyes lighted up with eupidity-
all dangers, past and future were forgotten.
He stretched outhis lian1 to  elras hie por-
tion, when Mike coolly jlanc ng at him,
eatd,-"You must wait 'a bit, my boy-we
must smnash those'screens first :" healingg
that the Bank notes must be exchanged'for-
gold.
We can doltat, in the morning ,at any
of the shops," observed Frank, 'beginning
to be alarmed lest 'this should be a plan for
cheating hm of his portion.
" What afool you are," retorted. Mike.-
"If you take one of the flimsies to get
change to-morrow, you'd get it at the 01si
Bailey or Newgate in, an hour after. Why,
these ntimbrg -will be all over town he-

on the ruffian's face, however, Frank saw
that something was wrong.        ;
"'What'ethe matter now?' asked he..
"Matter.l,' echoed Mike, with a volley
of deep and bitter curses.- " Why,, there's
that old scoundral of a fiend.robs me, that
all.- This is the sort of game,' my boy,"
add ted Mike, savagely.  ' We -are com.
pelted Ito.,be robbed in order to keep our
necks safe, and we are forced to rob in
orde to ,do the same thing, 9r ,else theses
fello s.would-split upon us next day ;" and

that the notes amounting :to nearly., one
hundred and twenty ;pounds, had dminish-

booty. " What use to rob in order to be

" hat's'what I say," commented Mike,
who had 'overheard him ; "but you can't
help it. If fou do it once with them, you
mus  always do it, or else they are safe to
sell you."

clenalred hands and shook tbenat the door,

,would be. better-r;-it would be better !",this
was all he said ; and returning the way they
cam, theysioon got back 'tothe huge old

"I say," eked Mudge of the main who
played the, part of porter, " are any of the
boys in "

"Well,. I've booked; my 'swag,'" said,

"AIlright,":replied the ian ;ad Mike,
followedhy Frank, turned up stairs.
On arriving at the chamber,. Mike care-
fully,ezamined a small map, opened then
the large boxc Frak had noticed, and took
gut a pair of pistols,. which h put into his
breast. Tightening a belt rognd his Waist,
and finally fixing ,on his boots, he seemed
about to be undertaking a new ex~pedtion.
"Why, what are zou about?" cried Frank
at last.
Tuin going to fetch thehundred pounds,"
replied Mike, "Will you go with me "
tl sho  youhowto tame a villain like that
-.how to cut his claws, and pull out his

"Bit what are those pistols for ?"

With great precaution and no .little dan-

the roofs of which were higher or lower,

,houses were, built. The one where Grapps

" But really, papa, there is some one
waiting for you." It was then that a nun-
her of the men happening to be released
from labor, suddenly stopped, arrested by
the sight of a handsome carriage without
the great gate ; but the lowers and 'shrubs
about the spot where Andrew sat, prevented
him from seeing it.
A footman in an elegant livery made his
appearance, bearing a portfolio under his
arm, and a small case in his hand.. Taking
's ealed paper out Of his portfolio, he handed
it after an inquiry' with a low bow to An-,
drew, together with the case,'which, upon
opening, AndrEw found to contain a medal.,
-this le gave 'to his wife for inspection,
and' proceeded to read the papers.
Certainly it must have been a very strange
paper that, for It made the, breast of the'
brave man pint and heave, and his eyes to;
sparkle with a sudden joy. A trembling of
the limbs seized him for an instant, and then
the workmen without, having heard some-
thing of the business which brought the
messenger there, gave three hearty cheers
to Edward Douglass, while the poor father,
to the boy's astonishment, clasped him to
his bosom.

But Andrew was enmbracing his son.: ' I

to her, and mastering his emotion, "'is' a

calculating the danger tohimself,he plunged
into the water, and by great exertion saved
them. -This-is a testimony to his courage
and bravery, which I prize mor:than all
the military medals in the word, 'though,"
he added, smiling. " my old uncle would
not have thought so."
Edward stood beside him, his cheeks suf-
fused with a blush of joy ancl modesty.--
Some of the older and more privileged men
had come into the arbour, and Bshaking him
by the hand, congratulated, him on his
bravery; then the handsome medal was
passed round aming them and'greatly ad-

and it |was hoped - that, with the coming
spring, matters would (as they did) begin
to brighten 'up.
But there:also happened in conjunction to
the frightful paralysis of trade, one of those
strange and inexplicable events which, upon
a scale vast and gigantic, appear to be- the
ravages of some supernatural being rather
than the result of accident: In the exten-
sive village -of D-'--, situated in the
most central part of the west of England,

were established and thousands of opera-
tives dwelt, a great and terrible fire took
place,which-almostannihilated the property
on the spot, And by means of 'which many
lives ware lost.
This'again called upon the sympathies of
men, and the nanie of Andrew Douglass
was amongst-the first of those who advanced
to their relief. -The property was insured
to -almost its full amount jn the variousoffi-
ces-; 'bdt the people,--tbe' artizan,  the
weaver,' and the mechanic-had lost their
all,-.-their, in some eases, costly tools, their
furniture, and their clothing.' It was in
their favor that public sympathy    was
aroused and turned, and Andrew Douglass,

the noble work of benevolene' which now
prompted him, determined to visit the spot
himself.

THE GAMt1STER'S PROGRESS.
BOOK III

CIIAPTER .L.t
LOOSE UPON TOWN.
IT was oaa dull November day, when the
atmosphere of London was as, thick, as
drisaly, as smelly,,and as disagreeable as
it ,uld weli be! and everything felt as cold
end Blam my to tie touch, that a well-grown
yout i of about seventeen years of age,'was
seated in a small coffee-house,situated in-one
of the numerous courtsntu ping out of Fleet
Street.
His coat which- had once been handsome
and well-cut, was now grown rusty and
threadbare ; his hat was seedy, his boots
soiled, and out at the toes ; his linen of a
yellowish tinge, had shrunk under his worn
cravat ; in fact, he had an air of faded gen-
tility which as plainly as possible spoke
that he had fallen under the frowns of for-
tune, and that he was in the "sere and yel-
low leaf " of his luck,-in other words, he
wasa homeless-parentless-friendless vag-
abond.
His pale face was certainly handsome;
but there was also in his jaded air that pe-
culiar expression resulting from dissipation
and precocious excesses. His melancholy
and downcast eyes told that his heart wose
sunken and heavy.
" Well, Jack Hazard," he muttered,
apostrophislng himself, as he jingled over
the few halfpence in 'his pocket, "1you are
Ina nice condition now, I hope. What do
you-propose to do next? My father," he s

continued, changing the grammatical form
of his colloquy, " made a nice mess of it,
when he began at the tavern, and swore that
I'had the sweetest voice of all the boys be-
longing to St. Paul's choir ; and when my
mother-heaven- rest her, and forgive my
share in her death I" he added with' some
emotion, "used to send me to  fetch, him
home, he' would make mesdrink; and sing
to hiW drunken comradeS, till I was as tipsy
as-himself.  What between that youthful
dissipation and card-playing, I am in a
pretty considerable fix, as the Yankees say.
Then he must needs go and win a lot of
money at a Derby sweep, and that did the
business. In three weeks he died raving
mad, and mother soon followed. The little
money he left me, found its way into the
pockets of tavern-keepersand billiard-room
sharps ; for I must go and bet like other
fools on races; and try my luck in twenty
or thirty sweeps,-and, as a matter of
course, be fleeced of all. What's to be
done ?" and he threw himself back in his
seat with an air of perplexity.
" I'll tell you, sir, if you'll permit me,"
responded a voice almost over his shoulder.
Hazard started-and looked up, and met the
glance of akeen, restless pair of eyes, where
cunning and a sort of malicious sarcastico
klnd of humor lurked.
This individual was a Jeremy Diddler
sort of man, but upon a highly respectable
scale. The face was thin and sallow, the

" : hagv gone through that same-noble or-

- ' No doubt. of it, count," replied Jack
quickly, beginning at the same time to be
interested; in, the promises of this indi-
vidual who'was so liberal, in his profes-
sions. , .                 -
" What expectations have you ?" pursued
Count de la Roos:
" That of starving, for aught I know,"
was:the answer ; " for my father, who;was
in business as a carpenter, knocked it up
before Ihada chance of being able to do a
day's work."
"Sppsible man I" said the count.  "I
admire him. . Work! workis plebeian"-
and he curled his lips in disdain: " the vo-j
taries of fortune never work. Will you join
with. me?"
"In what?" asked Jack, while stirring up
the remains of his cold coffee.
" Keen- keen, air, I perceive," remarked
the count. "I'll tell you :-in a dinner, a
bottle of fine gin, a lodging, and so forth ;
but, above all, in a spec--a spec, sir."
"I will join you willingly," was the re-
ply," as all the former are very welcome
to'tne'; and in the'ist one also, if it can
be made serviceable to either you or my-
self." 4
"Not a doubt of it. Here, waiter" two
cups'of"coffee." The order was'obeyed ;
and when the attendant -was gone, Count
Addlphe" resumed : " I .was asking you'
what your expectations were-that is,
whetber'yot have'any friends or relations
+' The former have discarded -me," said
Jack,.a little:mournfully ; " but they were
poor ; and," added he ungratefully,f ' they
were no great loss. I have some relay
tions,, I believe, but I know little about
thpta.

" Rich?"demanded De Ia0oos, Iaoni*
cally..
" bave heard that one, of them is so,
but I do not know who or what he is."
"fWe'llfind him out," said the count,
brightening up. and added in a very deci-
ded tone, "we'll discover him, sir, and
give you to his fond, arms as a, long-lost
and, affectionate relative. Now finish up
that mahogany decoction, and let us be
going. I have a few things to say to you
in private." Jack did as he was desired,
and they quitted the place..
The evening found them   seated' in a
convenient attic which the count was wont
to hire as 'his summer residence-the house
being situated in that airy department of
this modern Babylon, denominated 'Clerk-
enwelL-
The fashion of the West End, so far as
the furniture was concerned, was more
strictly followed, In "the breach" rather
than in the ' observance." A turn down
bedstead was concealed in:a kind of large
cabinet with folding doors, bearing impress
of the "New Cut" manufacture, an old
table, two or three chairs, a few culinary
articles, and a great scarcity of crockery,
constituted the,. domestic, properties of
Adolphe Count de la Roos.
He did not, however, waste time In apolo-
gizing for the meagreness of his accom-
modation ; but he spread the cloth, laid
food on the table, placed out the promised
liquor, and taking apack' of cards from a
recess at ban'd, began the monent the meal
was over to initiate Hazard still farther
into the mysteries of gaming, which plain-
ly exhibited his superiority over the youth,
'hatever might 'have been his previous
qualifications.'
" You play 'all fours,',do you ?" said be,
during the conversation Which ensued
" very good-it's a low game, but it suits
a beginner admirably. The. exercise of
'shuging,' 'cutting,' and' turning up,' ,i
not to be despised-it gives one dexterity
in the manipulation of these truly scientific
auxiliaries to a mapof the world; but,

you do play ' all fours,' be, a master at it-
avoid cribbage-it's only fit for old men an(
their wives-not for artists: it requires to
much play ; acd you can't manage matter
so well."
Jack Hazard acknowledged'the correct
ness of the count's remarks, and in assent
log to them  promised to avail himself o
the experience which that worthy lnau
must necessarily possess.
"Now," continued the count, thought
fully, as he caressed his chin, " I can giv
you an entire into life ; but is not a very
suberb one-yet, that must be managed
afterwards, and by~your means--"
" Mine I" interrupted Jack, lifting up his
eyes in surprise, while a smile of incredu-
lity crossed his features: " how- can that
be?"
"Don't interrupt me," returned the
count; "it's done   in exceedingly bad
taste, not to :add that it breaks into one's
train of thoughts. How much money have
you?". and he bent his keen eagle-eye upon
Jack.
"About sevenpence halfpenny," replied
Jack, exhibiting his stock of wealth.
" Not much; but 'still better than none,"
was the comment of the sharper. "I have
known a fortune to be based upon as small
a found tion., The mischief of such for-
tunes, however, is, that:they grow in the
manner (f an inverted pyramid :-theyare
not secur t. It is for that reason," added
be, philosophically, "I have never sought.
to build nine upon a seale of such magni-
tude. In moderation there is safety."
- All thea while he was shuffling and cut-
ting the cards with 'a dexterity and quick-
ness-whh'h betrayed one- practised in' that
branch of the' useless arts. " Hatn!"; he
murur'ed;'"be must have a little more
mor'y. I never give-I can lose a little,.
andt', teu re will go forth and see what can
b done;"' so saying,- he dealt them and
resumed : " We are about :to play ' all

a chance.' Play i I put amy stake down"-
ad ai *34 a erown-piece on the table-

- "and yours .shall he considered, if you
d: lose, as.a debt of honor. Play."
o   The game proceeded., Jack showed,
s great ability, and Count. Adolphe compli
rented him upon it, at the same time in-
terspersing his voluble chatter with, a
variety of observation and instruction, all,
f pleasantly enough intermingled,' were its

whose singularity of .selection did . no;;
strike Jack as being of the wisest ; but he,
was yet to learn that a rman lile the count;
did not bestow his philanthropy without p
clear object in view.
-"Now,",'said Count Adolphe, abruptly,
as he rose, 5' it is time for us to go abroad ;
and mark me," he added, rather sternly:
"the money you have won from mne, must,
be trebled -at least,, before we return : so
make your toilette, clean your boots, wash,
your face, trim. your hair, brush your hat,.
put on that clean front"-handing him
one,-" and then we shall be prepared."
In a few minutes , afterwards the count,
was pleased to pass a compliment upon the
changed appearance of the young man;,
and certainly, with a little trouble and
less cost, never- was a more remarkable
metamorphosis., Brushes, soap, and water,
had done their work well.
They went forth.   It required some

.R NRCH    H HAZARD.
IN a gorgeously fitted little chamber be-
longing t' one of the' most widely-known
private' gambling 'establishments, 'of 'the
West End, Adolphe 'Cbunt'de la Ross Was
seated, cr ekitg filberts, drinking claret,and
half-reelining kt his ease, while  Conversing
with an 'individual, who, with, his feet oil
the fbnder, was coolly cmoking'acigat.
We taie described the count,'we must
now give some little idea of his companion,
who was no other than the huge and burly
giant that k-pt the tavern where Jack made
his first successful debut.
The man stood six feet two, with 'a head
and nec  like those 'of a bull. In the
thick, sen ual lips, in the nose of Ethiopian
forfnation, in the small, half-shut eyes, the
seamed a d 'bloated cheeks, you 'traced ait
exaggeration of the animal passions, which
ir.stihctively made you recoil' with aversion
and disgust.- The saytyr-like features were
indicative of a depravity' that we dare not
trust ourselves toahy'a farther description.
The small bitt elegant room' was bril-
liantlylighted with gats; the air was warm;
the two men weie surrounded with luxuries,
and on the table among the bottles lay
some'peculiarly formed'implementsof gam-
ing.
So you think you've done the trick, do
yon, ount?"' observed the gladiator, in a
hoarse, husky voice, inundating the bright
bars as he spoke with a sktaration of 'to-
bacco juie.       -
"I'll tell you'what it is, Digges," returned
Adolphe with an indescribable insolence of
pOliteness: - "when -you make 'remarks of
that:kind, lot it- be don with an expression
of more confidence in my skill., Do you
think, witliyour bull-head,' add your thick4
er brain, that ataa like myself carries as

P1ri

aspemiultive theory-for months upon the
mere chance of being; right or wrong ? I
do not think'-I know it to be so."
"Well, may 'he you 'do,'I growled the
other, "only,.don't be so dignified over it,
and be hanged' to yien or I'll'get up and
knock you over ;" and, as he struck off the
ashes at the end of his cigar, his vice 'died
away in his throat like'distant thunder.
"Ah 1" exclaimed the count, "you must
always let the animal exhibit itself in your
nature. I 'don't know what could possibly
have made me join issue with a fellow only
fit to carry porter'slosds., We shall have
you spoil some of, our best designs with
your,abominable brutality shortly.""
"Come, I say, don 't,-draw it mild,"
returned the bther, threateningly..
"Douyoti'menu e me, you rascal Y" del
manded Adolphe, turning leis wicked glance
upon the giant, wbQ seemed to be awed by,
its. power., "Do you know that I can trans-
port or gibbet you?"
"There, that'll do," said Digges, ina
gentler tone, like the subdued growl of a
tiger,: "I know -you're a, trump.. What's
the use of talking this way? You've pick
ed up a feller as is well enough in hisway
but what's to he #lne'wlth him?"
"I'll tell you, if you'll listen," returned
the count, blandly, mollified by the sub
mission of the huge Oaliban; "because you
have got-a part to play in the Meatter ;! and
as good opportunity' .now, I'll explain.-+-t

"Eh: I see," observed fDigges, with an
expression of great knowiugness : "that's

"Yes," returned the count.\ "The sis-

that he refused: torhave anything tore to

"Yes," replied Jack,; "who do ,yoq think
it is?"
" I eanaot.tell,"replied Adolphe. "Some
Freshman or other who thinks himself very
clever, I make no doubt."
" The very same .youth that.you and I
plucked so cleverly on the nightthat I first
'came out?"     .
"Indeed?" exclaimed the - count, some-
what uneasily, " Does he knewyou?"
"No," was the answer. "You forgot that
he was so attentive. to his glass. I have
spoken wish him, and he does not evince the
slightest recognition."
"A hI well, that will do," observed the
count. "Where is he now?"
" In safe hands," returned Jack ; "he is
In good keeping, and by the time we get to
the place, he will be at play, or else well

" Let us adjourn at once, then," saJd the
count," that we may have a little practice'

And accordingly Count 'Adolphe and
Jack quitted the chamber, leaving the prize-
fighter alone with his beloved rum. Soon
after they enterd'd a massive pile of build-
ings turning from Jermyn street; where
they passed up the lobbies, whose doors
were guarded by plates of =iron,' massive
bolts, and, strong, desperate'looking men.;

ABoUT two o'clock ,R the fay, Hazard
arose ureffeshed frot his sleep ;, and even
while he caught eight of the gsney op. the
table,. there ran a dark- vein sf mingled
horror ai4 disgust through 4g yarious
thoughts which oppressed him, end colpred
both the present pad  ie future, to hii, in.
hues of 4arkess.
Do what he Would, he could not rid him-
self of that dreadful depression, It clung
around, it hanat9d hi,:;it peopled the air
with shadowy faces, and seemed to dig pits
for his foot wherever he trod.
He dressed himself', and sought his little
sitting-room,- ere he went forth into the
larger apartment common to himself and
the Count. The newspaper of the day was
placed beside his coffee. He sat at the fire
moodily, and mechanically began his break-
fast.
After awhile, he turned his eye languidly
upon the paper, and as he stretched out his
hand so take it up, he muttered: "I am
growing afraid of spy own shadow, I think.
f men will be bad enough to encourage
such rascal' as myself by their folly, why
should. they not be 'eade to suffer' for it.
They provide me with the means of sub

taming a living honestly, why, I must take

weaving the somewhat amusing slang of
the men who.are accustomed to their trade,
with promises of enormous wealth on the
spot ; and thosewho crowded.round, flung
down their money with avidity; for there
had been a run ofluck against the bank,-
and though some cautions winners had de-
parted. there remained plenty more to pay
up the deficiency with ample interest.
Hazard advanced and looked on, He
was unmindful of the burly giant of a man
who stood most beside him ; he was un-
mindful of the wins and nods that were
passed around ; he did not remark the keen
and rapid glance which the count flung upon
him, nor the sarcastic lifting of the eye-lid
with which he appeared to accompany that
glance:- Hazard.was absorbed in his own
thoughts.

Waiddowahnd died. It was the curse aris-
ing from a his want of education, that he
knew not.-how to bestow his time. - Books
he had in plenty ;round him; but he deriv'
4e no pleasure from them. lfictures.he had
looked upon as mere auxiliaries to the tur-
nishiog of a room.; but further than that
they ceased to interest him. Horses he
had, and he often used- them, and to some
little extent he had created a little acquaia,
tanceship among- the small squires, the
farmers, jockies, and so on, of t e neigh-
borhood ; but even these were of a class
that showed him he was not in the circle
he wished to be in. There was drinking at
the fair, and a game of bowls on the green,
and rustic festivities, where, vice in a
meauand depraved garb still exercised her
rule.
If he moved abroad, the hateful form of
the giant Digggs,still. crossed his path ; it
he stayed at home, the huge animal would
force himself upon him; and still laboring
pnder the dread of exposure, he allowed
himself to be. plundered. At times, too, a
short and laconic note from the count, re-
minded him of the terrible power he had
over him. But he did not demand money;
and, further than that Hazard knew him
gelf tobe under the eyes of the bruiser, he
experienced no  other annoyance from
Adolphe de la Roos Jones.
In the meantime, with one edess or an-
6ter,'he was impairing his' tortune, which
he 'too'l'no heed to guard. Having taken
Ssad leave of his cousin Laura, udder some
retest or another, he went to 'Paris in the
ope' af being able to drown his cares and
remorse in'the dissipations of the capital.
'he gaming-tables' found a"practised man
tn be their easiest victim ; for he seemed to
quandhre away his gold with ' reckless-
less that would have beggared him, had
he not been stopped by the following oc-
hutrekibe:_
He was one night in the Palais Royal,
playing with the tame avidity as ever,
a , a tall man in a oloak touched him by
the arm,tand said:
"The count wantayou."         .

! PRORES.                       $2
He turned and recognized the brutal
countenance of his watcher.
The terror with which this man Inspired
him was now complete. He had established
so entire a despotism over Hazard-had
exercised it with so much rigor, that. the
unhappy youth gave himself up unresist-
ingly to it. He began to dread the sound
of that heavy foot, the sight of those
drunken and bloated features ; in fact, the
man had but to will and Hazard to obey.
On this occasion, then, with a new linking
of the heart, he followed the pugilist to a
neighboring apartment, where the only per.
son he inet was Adolphe Count de la Roos,
in person.
" Sob 1 you're quite Parisian In tiste, eh,
Mr. Hazard ?" began the count with a smile,
"I congratulate you; I have no doubt 'but
that you have learned somethinghere.that
may be highly advantageous to ds, only I
regret that I must recall you back to Eug.
land."
" To England 1" echoed Jack.- "Where-
fore ?"
"Because, you will' remember that the
year of grace I gave you isr nearly up.
Miss Copland is also anxious about you,
aud.has been asking questions which Ican
answer;, and because, also, my speculation
has not turned out so well as I"fanced it
might. 'I shall require further help from
you."1
"You are pitiless," returned Jack, in a
tone of hopelessness. "You have broken
taith with me in placing this hideous
brute as a watch upon me ; it has drawn
me from ,London in the hope of losing sight
of him."
J " o you mean that Digges, here ?"
pointing to him,"has been annoying you?"
dcmalnded Adolphe, r a ,an would- who
is about to 4o. away with an intolerable
nuisance,,
"I do," was the sullen reply.

It was twelve o'clock at night ; and the
degraded sharpers were plaing their trade
in a place that existed within' the last.

An extensive range of'celibrage, situated
under a large shop, at'theddirer of one of
the great publIc thoroughfares of the West

elegance, was fitted up as "wine vaults;"'

Descending a fight of steps out of 'the

somely papered room, beore'an elegant

complete.
He was not certain whether his lodgings
were known to any or not ; but still, as not
one came, he began to feel more reassured ;
he had so far recovered himself as to ask
for the newspaper, and there, to his dismay,
vead with alarming accuracy thp particu-
lars of the revolting homicide. How the
reporter dwelt upon the magnitude of the
crime, and the fearful struggle that must
have taken place during the conflict. How,
with practised judgment,.they had drawn
the almost correct conclusions, and thedark
hints of the probability of the officers of
justice being upon the track of the crimi-
nal, almost petrified Hazard with dread of
the fatal consequences of this last crowning
piece to all his former crimes. The paper
dropped from his hands, and for awhile,
with motionless limbs and haggard looks.he
continued to gaze upon it with the strange
fascination with which the frog looks upon
the snake about to devour him, but is un-
able to avert his eyes, or reive from the
spot.
His first impulse, upon coming to himself,
was to go and deliver himself up ; but the
dreadful thought of public execution. and
the disgrace that would thus be entailed
upon Laura, prevented him. Upon more
mature deliberation-a conclusion probably
arived at through the instinctive love of

life to which all cling-he made up hit
mind to return, before it was too late, 1o
Berkshire, settle his property upon Laura,
and leave his native land forever. But his
mental agony increased to such a decree as
first part or his resolution was promptly
acted upon according tohis wishes, the land
to which he journeyed was that bourne from
which no traveller ever returns. His brok-
en constitution could not bear up against
his malady, and a plain tombstone shortly
after marked the resting-place of Jack Haz-
ard.

A settled melancholy took possession of her,
and in a few short months she was borne to
the grave amid the tears of all who knew
her, and the sorrow of the neighborhood.
Before she departed this life she bequeath-
ed the whole of the Berkshire estates to a
charitable institution, and the hand of provi-
dence could be seen in the arranging of
events so as to take from out of the hands
of the viciouswhat only gave more ample
means for them to indulge in vice, and be-
stoW the property upon an institution that
was calculated to protect the youth of fu-
ture generation from the snares into which
the unfortunate Jack Hazard fell.
Digges, after a short run, was at length
arrested, and convicted of manslaughter,
and is now serving the remainder of hig
natural life in chains in a penal colon.
