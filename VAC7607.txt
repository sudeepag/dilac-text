CHAPTER I.
THE SILENT DEATE.
The day had been sultry; but as it neared
its close, soft and grateful zephyrs breathed
balmily through the luxuriant Indian scenery.
Earth and air seemed dreaming together.
The murmurs of leaves were whispered
thoughts, and the ripplings of running waters
half revived memories of the past. The nod-
ding flowers fainted and languished in their
own perfumes ; the long grass drooped
dreamily in the voluptuous atmosphere. The
birds ceased to , sing, soothed :and content
with the mere pleasure of mute existence.
Even the deadly serpent lay harmless in its
coil, robbed for a time of its malice by the
all-conquering sweetness of the most delicious
climate in the world.
At this pleasing hour, when Nature herself
sympathized with her creations, pulsing her
own mysterious life into all animate things, a
maiden, more beautiful than graceful palm
or bending acacia, moved slowly from the
trellised veranda of a . bamboo cottage to
the sheltering canopy of a patriarchal ban-
yan tree, beneath whose spreading arms she
seated herself, on the folds of an Indian
shawl.
She was a young English girl, of eighteen
years, with an exquisite form, and a face .to
love at first sight. Her skin was whiter than
the transparent muslin she wore, or the large
pearls that encircled her neck and arms and
hung in silvery lobps from her dark hair,
after the fashion of the nativess. -Her teeth,
seen through her crimson lips, were like
drifted snow. Her eyes were large, her face
oval and faultless in every feature.
Her expression, as she reclined in the
shade of the banyan, was serene and thought-
ful. She had brought with her al book, but
the falling twilight blurred the pages ; and

she put it aside, and abandoned herself to
the gentle influences of the hour.
What the English beauty thought of, who
may tell? Who shall guess the fancies that
floated through her pretty head? Perhaps
her consciousness was of earth ; possibly of a
celestial region in the clouds.- Whatever
were her reflections, it is certain that she
presented a most pleasing picture to the eye,
which well might be pardoned for returning
again and again to the delightful contempla-
tion.
Sometimes her eyes rested pensively upon
the foliage at her feet ; sometimes they wan-
dered dreamily upward through the thick
branches of the trees-to fleecy little islands
in the clouds; and sometimes the long, silk-
en lashes closed languidly, shutting out'
everything but the flowing shapes and images
in her own brain.
.On her right was the bamboo cottage, peep-
ine from a mass of foliage, scented with the
odor' of the Indian rose, and relieved. by the
flowing leaves of the scarlet sagittaria; while
at her left the tamarind, palm, and the ban
yan, growing in serried columns, stretched
downto the banks of the Jumna River-form-
ing long and shady avenues, not only pictur-
esque to the sight, but most grateful in the
tropical heats.
In one of these natural arcades, a nearly
naked figure had been lying for the last hour.
This half-nude body pertaied to and com-
prised the personality of one of those' no-
madic natives of India, whose lives, habits,
religion, and manner of qubsistende, are alike
a terror and a mystery.
While he lay nestled in the long grass, he
occasionally lifted himself upon his knees
and looked toward -the bamboo cottage with
an earnestness that evinced no ordinary pur-
pose.
- In critically observing his swarthy face,

CHAPTER V.
HYDnABAD.
Neal Kavanagh had no sooner fallen than
Barnabas Hutton appeared at the spot, riding
his elephant. Je was not a little astonished
at seei  so may pale faces, nor was his sur-
prise diminished when Methuselah, with an
angry whistle, rushed to the scene of the en-
counter, and seizing the tiger in his trunk,
held him aloft in air.
Perceiving soon that the tiger did not
struggle, he tossed him into the jungle with
an lnnignant cry, and turned his attention to
Kavanagh, who was lying quite still.
It was then that the noble animal displayed
that intelligence which has rendered its spe-
cies famous in every country where it is
known.
He lifted the Lieutenant carefully. The
arm of woman couldnot have encircled him
more gently. He set him upon his feet, and
seeing that he could not immediately main-
tain his footing, made a mournful noise.
The friendly offices of the elephant were
not in vain ; the motion started his blood and
restored his consciousness. Grasping the
trusty trunk of the animal, he soon managed
to support himself; which encouraging
symptom appeared to give Methuselah the
liveliest pleasure.
In the interim, Miss Macgregor had arisen;
and now, impelfed by every instinct of her
sex, advanced to'the assistance of Neal Kav-
anagh. However benevolent her intentions.
Methuselah could not so well judge of them
as his master, and made a remonstrative
movement as the young lady approached.
'"None o' that, old boy !" exclaimed Barna-
bas, who had thought proper to maintain a
strict silence, during the foregoing act and
ministrations of Methuselah. "'That isn't
the kind of animile as young English officers
are afraid of. They'd sooner, a durn sight,
run arter 'em than from 'em. Let her come,
old chap, and I'll wager your trunk chock
full of sweetmeats that she'll bring him
round quicker'n you can turn a summerset
back'ards."
Barnabas slid down from his mountain of
flesh; and Methuselah, without further care-
mony, set Kavanagh between his great flap-
ping ears, and would have soon placed the
young lady beside him,, had not his master
interposed; his trunk being already around
her waist.
" That never'll do," said Barnabas. A boy
seven years old would know better'n that.
How'd you s'pose he's goin' to stick on up
there ? Goin' to put the gal up to hold him
on, wasn't ye? Meant well 'nough, I essay,

" Their discourse concerned Kavanagh, of
whom Bracegirdle was intensely jealous. He
bargained with Hydrabad to remove him
from his path."
"This seems incredible t" exclaimed Meli-
cent.
" The bargain was easily made. 'For one
thousand rupees, he was to drop into the
wound a poison so penetrating, that it would,
in due time, produce death." -
"I see-I partly comprehend, said Miss
Rainbold..
"I wished to thwart this crafty villain in
my own way. Knowing of one very learned
in the mystery of drugs and poisons, I lost
notime in seeking him; a journey that nev-
er could have been accomplished without the
aid of Mr. Barnabas and his elephant... By
the blessing of God I reached the hut of the
solitaire and procured the antidote. The
details of. the adventure I will relate to
you at some future time ; for the undertak-
ing was not unattended with danger.  I
had-warned the young Sahib,'before setting
out, not to have Hydrabad approach him, or
touch his arm; but when Ireturned, the-mis-
chief was done. . Hydrabad had stolen in
while he slept, and dropped the deadly agent
into the wound. His condition, this morning,
you can yourse1(recall to mind. I had sup-
posed nothing would transpire before morn-
ing, and was shocked and alarmed at what
I beheld, 'You know what followed. You
saw the wily Hydrabad come in. You heard
the words of Kavanagh concerning Mr. Bar-
nabas, and what he said when he came in, he
having been instructed by me. My mistress,
behol this vial 1" She held up the serpen-
tine vial. "It sparkles in the red rays of the
sinking sun like the souls of a hundred dia-
monds !"
" Truly, girl, it is like concentrated white
flame! And so you dropped a drop of this
glittering fluid into the wound?".
"I dropped it into the wound, my mistress,
and the Sahib lives."
"It is most wonderful! Why was this
kept from me?".
" why does anything happen that happens?
Why did Hydrabad come? Why did your,
lover come? Why are all things as they
are? Because it is the will of God1" replied
Alethe, with humility.
" A strange reason, but perhapsagood one.
My impatient and impulsive nature might
not have been able to practice the necessary
restraint."  Melicent paused, then .laid her
right hand on the girl's breast.. " Alethe Y"
she said-her accents were melancholy..
"My mistress !" responded Alethes
"Answer me this question. No you hear
me, Alethe ?"
" I hear you, mistress.",

" Answer this question, and answer it tru-
ly : Does Ida Macgregor-does Ida Mac-
gregor-"
Melicent's voice failed her
Alethe kissed herJips, 'and answered:
"Yes, sweet mistress, Ida loves himI!"
Melicent threw her arms around the girl's
neck, and sobbed  lke a child,- Alethe felt
the hot tears raining on her,ec . -She drew
the exquisite .iead nearer and neger,;kept
her soft lips dn the white sorehead, and tp-
ped the smooth cheeks ,contig uouslywith
her little hand. There' was meffable balm
i the silent ministrationis of the girl. ,Never,
never had Melicent realized the, inestimable
treasure of human sympathy. She clung to
lethe as if every hope  everyr, happiness
washin her.
The girl knew the mockery of words, and
did not interrupt this passionate outburst
of emotion, She permitted ,her to weep
on, unrestrained. The paroxysm gradually
passed; the tears. ceased t6 flow, the sobs
melted to sighs, and the sighs became leng-
thened respirations.
She was presently calm again. Embrac-
ing Alethe tenderly, she lookedsat the setting
sun,  d said, with composure :
"Itis time to return. But before we go
back, let me see you enter the hollow of this
tree. Really, my friend, it seems impossible
that this apparently solid trunk can contain
a human being."
"You shall, see I" cried Alethe, smilingly,
and pushing away the grass, disappeared so
suddenly that Melicent doubted the{evidence
of her eyes.
No sooner had the girl entered, than with
a,terrified cry she sprang out.
"HafIz! poor Hafi 1" she cried, wringing
her hands. " This is the reward of his faith-
fulness. This is his recompense for his de-
votion to me !"
"What is the matter ?" asked Melicent.
"You are shocked and terrified."
" The poor youth,"' cried Alethe, ".Will
never watch more. He is dead ; he.lies cold
on the ground. He has been discovered and
slain. Stumbled over his body ; .I touched
his face, it was the fage of'a corpse. Hafiz !
poor Hafiz ".-
" Grieve not, Alethe. The sin of his death
is not your. Fortunately, here comes my
father.. His. face glows with kindness I
love my father to-night."
"Waiting for another tiger,. girls," cried
the Major,, "or have you set your caps for a
Thug?"
"Father, hasten! Some one has killed
Hafiz."
.-"Killed Hafizt  Where Is he ?" said the
Major,with a self-possession quite at variance
with the agitated ;feelings of Melicent.
