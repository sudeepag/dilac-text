CHAPTER I.
PETER      nUT.
The balmy winds of the Sea Islands went rip-
pling across the green belts of intervening water
to the main land, breathing blandly on plan-'
tations of cotton and swamps of rice, break-
ing, finally, in Ianguid'waves on a far-stretch-
ing, barren shore of pine woods, in the narrow,
irregular openings of which"Haight be seen
scattered, at varying distances, the ill-construct-
ed huts of thriftless whites, whose indolent, vag-
abond habits form a peculiar and distinctive
feature of Southern life.
At a certain point in the foreground of this
pine belt, between it and the sea, stood, at the'
beginning of the civil war, the humble cabin of
one Peter Rust, known for his eeeentricities and'
wandering propensities all along the tide-water
section, from Beaufort to Lake Desmniond, and
whose means of existence was a subject of mys-
tery and speculation. To some, he was knows
as a wood-chopper ; to others, as a still-hunter';
procuring the simple necessities of life by lopg
and silent tramps in the barrens, ranging at in-
tervals, when' it suited his mood, the entire
coast- to the distant Alleghanies ; while there
were a few poor whites who shook their torpid
~1ads atnd hinted at darker game, and a more
lucrative pursuit.
Although Peter had a dwelling at the some-
what ambiguous place we have named, it was
.persistently affirmed by the suspicious and idle
that be had other-haunts, and, despite his seem-
ing loneliness, comrades and accomplices in the
obscurities of the forest. Not choosing to as-
sociate with the, lazy and the lawless, and keep-
ing strictly 'his own' company, he made' ene-
mies of those who, under any circumstances,
would scarcely have made good . friends and
trust companions.
When the South arose in flaming wrath to
welcome her Northern nei hbors. " with bloody

hands to hospitable graves," Peter Rust was a
marked man ; and none so hard upon. him as
those butted drones who had nothing to lose
in the game of war.
Within easy eye-range of Peter's modest cab-
in, rising on the crest of a graceful -swell, was a
mansion of unusual size and architecture. This
habitation, though built in a land of beauty
and visited by soft, southern suns, had nothing
warm and cheerful in its outward aspects, and
repelled rather than invited the approaches of
the curious. It was 'surrounded by a village of
negro huts, which swarmed with life of every
hue, from the eighth drop of the octoroon to
the full quota of the genuine black.
One morning, Peter Rust sat at his cabin-
door, cleaning his double gun, when a man,
whom he had seen more than once lolling in
the sun near a smoky shanty in one of the pine
openings in the vicinity, swaggered up to him
with an air of importance that had much na-
tive impudence in it." Peter aid npt notice his
coming iI any perceptible manner. The per-
son, after staring at him a moment, opened a
mouth that extended from cheek to cheek, and
said, between a grunt and a growl, pointing to
the large dwelling on the slope :
"Wanted oer yon!"
Which ?" said Peter, carelessly, contriving
to squirt some black water'from the vent of his
gun into the nMan'sa ee.
"Wanted up to Lowenthal's," he answered,
wiping the sooty liquid from his face with the
back of a hand that was a stranger to the uses
of water.
" What's the handle to sich a tyke as you
be ?" asked Peter, pouring more water into the
barrels,'
. The fellow scowled and juarled at this easy
style of address.
"If you mean my name, it's Ben Dykes.

of the turpentine woods. Ben Dykes, the longg

range sIhotter. Ben Dykes, the dog-trainer.
Ben Dykes here, and Ben Dykes there."
" What a useful bein' you must be !" respond-
ed Peter, aiming another jet of water at Ben
Dykes' other eye. He squared off,'and mutter-
ed:
"Don't squirt no more o' that yer, mister !"
Peter laid his twin barrels across his knees,
and stared at Ben's mouth about long enough
to boil an egg. He shook his head gravely.
"Wonder it hadn't took your life," he said.
" Wonder what hadn't took my life ?" asked
Ben, sulienly.,
"If it had gone an in h further, 'twould took
your head off!" continued Peter, with increas-
ng seriousness.        -
"What took my head off ?" growled Ben.
" How did it happen ?" added Peter, impree-
sively,.
" What happen, you slow-spoken pup?" yell-
ed Ben, losing all patience.
" Why, that gash under your nose. Hardly
left enough for a hinge for the top to turn on-.-
did it?"
" G'long, you lank, slap-sided, lathy-legged,
lantern-jawed, bob-tailed setter!  Thar 1 take
that!"
Ben Dykes drew in a column of air that
reached to the bottom of his tattered trowsers.
" One o' the white trash, a'n't ye, Ben ?"
queried Peter, again turning to his work.
"Â«Better run back to your pups, hadn't ye ?
Some o' them nigger-dogs that you're training'
of may want ye. It must be interestin' to spend
your time 'mong p'inters, blooders, and bull-
pups !"'
Peter threw enough cool contempt into' his
voice to provoke Ben to his fighting temper.
" I don't mind your fling at the dogs,'. he re-
torted, hot with anger. "Snap at 'em ag'in, if
you want'to. As for my mouth, it's as, natur'
made it, and I'd thank ye to keep out on't."
"'Twan't an accident, then ?" said Peter,
thoughtfully, his eyes wandering as if mechani-
cally to the debatable mouth.
"If you don't stop, gapin' at me in that ar'
way, I'll give ye a gash worth hatin' !" men-
aced Ben. "But 'ta'n't my time to quarrel.
As I tole ye, yer wanted up to Lowenthal's."
"What if I don't choose to go ?" asked Peter
Rust, quietly.
"aTry it! try it ! Should like to have ye try
it'!"
Ben Dykes'was gleeful over this.
" Tell Lowenthal I'm  no man's man," an-
swered Peter, calmly.
"ISartin ! Sartin I'll tell him. He'll give it
up, Lowenthal will !" He rubbed his two palms.
together in a small spasm of satisfaction, and
grinned dreadfully.  . t -     -
"4Look out there, you Ben Dykes, or the kiv-
er of your mouth'll tip back'ards !".cried Pe-
ter, warningly.  "'Twould be eur'ous to see

your head hangin' on your shoulders, like a co-
quettish gal's bonnet in a hot day."
A change passed over Ben's face at that mo-
ment. It was as if a ray of mischievious light
had fallen upon the angry darkness of his ex-
pression. He blazed up.with exultation. His
visage said, distinctly:
"I have you now, Peter!"
" Look at me straight, you woo opper."
" I'm lookin'," said Peter, whose self-posses-
sion seemed never to forsake him.
"Say Cotton is. King !" dictated Ben, with
imps of malice sitting cross-legged and jubilant
in his eyes.
"Which ?"-inquired Peter, placidly.
"You've got to mouth it !" cried Ben, snap-
ping his fingers as netir Peter's nose as he could
without hitting it. "Everybody's got to say it
that's asked it, and anybody may ask it. .1oll
it as a sweet morsel under your tongue, you
thin-blooded, weak-kneed Yankee hound! The
Shibboleth, Lowenthal calls it, and woe to them
yer as can't pronounce it free and yearnest.
Come, now; out with it. Here goes! Cotton is
King !"
"1I do nothin' on compulsion," said Peter,
setting the twin barrels carefully on end against
the cabin. " I don't keer," he went on, "wheth-
er Cotton or Sweet Potaters is king. I'd as-
soon it 'twould be one as othere. have which
on 'em you like. Let it be Hemp, if you choose,
or Flax, for thlat matter. A deal o' difference
it'll make to a white trash whose king. As for
niggers, you never owned one, and never will.
You can lollop round in the sun like a dirt al-
ligator, and that's about all you're good for. If
you know when you're well-off, you'll take that
mouth o' yours to bead-quarters, and let it for a
commissary storehouse: it'll shed rain if you
keep the kiver down."
"If 'twasn't on other folk's business," mutter-
ed Ben, drawing a knife from one leg of his tat-
tered trowsers," I'd cut yer into l6ng, thin strips
and hang you on a pole to dry !"
Having cast this possibility at Peter, he
stropped his knife on six inches of bare brown,
arm.
"If I fall afoul of ye," responded P'eter..with
a steelish sort of glimmer in his quiet eyes,
"you won't know King Cotton from Northern
wool. You've got no courage, and you kuow
it. Put up your cleaver and be source !'
Ben Dykes slowly sheathed his weapon in Iis
trowser's leg and backed cautiously away, grim-
acing provokingly.             b   i     -
"Skedaddle !" cried Peter, rufflied bphis grin-
ning diabolism. -"Go to- him as sent ye, and
tell him I've my own affairs to mind."
Ben performed a series of sinister panto-"
mimes, and walked off with as much haste as his
lounging habits would allow.
Peter Rust-went on with his task in a mopd
less, cheerful. He wiped the twin barrels dry

MILROSE ; OR, THE COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.

and replaced .them in the stock with special
care. Ehe gun was a fine piece of workman-
ship. The barrels.beautifully finished, and fit-
ted to the wood as if they had grown there,
were of different weight- and calibre, and for dif-
ferent uses ; one being a shot-barrel and the
other a rifle. Peter Rust admired the weapon,
and seemed never weary of looking at the hair-
line-settings of the blue steel mountings, the
thorough and flush-edged lock-work, the curli-
ness of the sturdy old piece of English walnut,
the smoothness of the oil finish, and the sym-'
metrical completeness and perfection of the
united whole. Dykes had looked at it more
than once with covetous eyes.
The following evening, while Peter was re-
eling, half-asleep, under the branches of one of
the line patriarchs at his door, he was surround-
ed by a dozen mounted men, and informed that
he was a prisoner.
"Which?" asked Peter, rising and placing
his back to the tree.
The-word " prisoner -.was repeated by some
one.
" Who are ye ?" inquired Peter.
" Confederates," answered he who had before
spoken.
" Confederates !" repeated Peter.  "Two,
four, six, eight, ten, twelve.. It only took from
twelve to a dozen of ye to take me! And I
ain't quite taken yet. I could make a pretty
fight, if I's in the mood on't. But don't be
afeard. I'll keep the peace as long as you."
"Up to Lowenthal's with him !" said a voice
that Peter knew very well.
" Hillo I" cried Peter. "The man with the
hinge j'int on the back of his head, is hereabout.
Push him along, so I can see him. Ruther see
him than a caravan. In all my still-walkings,
up and down, ong and athwart, crossways and
lengthways, eoastways and inland, I never run
afoul of a eretur with his head cut off, afore."
Peter stored in inimitable wonder at Ben
Dykes.
"Set it over night, and what a eat-trap 'twould
make !'
The men laughed. Ben muttered some pine
barren invocations that were not brotherly.
" Thee will come along !" said a large man,
who had hitherto remained silent.
Peter turned to the speaker instantly. The
style of address surprised him..
"As there appears to be one decent man
apong ye, I'd like to ask that man, if it a'n't
takin' too much liberty, who he is, and what's
wanted of me ?"
I am," answered lie of the plain \language,
one Mirtin Broadbent, of whom you may, per-
chance, have heard, overseer of this plantation,
agent, tool, instrument, and,,as it- were, right-
hand of one Roscoe Lowenthal, landholder,
slaveholder, householder, gentleman born, gen-
tleeman bred, and rightful owner of the ground

you stand upon. I am duly commissioned to
couduet, convey, transport and carry, one Peter
Rust, wherever found, to yonder house on the
hill. Beyond this I know not. Dispute my
authority, which is derived from said Lowenthal
himself, and of a truth I wrill coerce, constrain,
force, enforce, and compel thee to go."
This avowal was made with a semi-religious
earnestness, in singular contrast to the bluster-
ing, profane manners of the creatures who sat on
their queer horses, squinting at Peter.
" Was ever the like heard !" exclaimed Peter.
"Was words ever so piled up? Hang that
solemn Quaker tongue in Ben Dykes' hoss-shed
of a mouth, and there'd be a voice for ye I"
"No -more a boss-shed than your own!l"
grumbled Dykes.
" My time isn't worth nothing, " continued
Peter., "Sprinkle some more words out o' your
pepper-box, Mr. Broadbent."
Peter looked so quizzical, that the lawless
crew laughed inconcert. The Quaker, however,
retained his gravity, which grew more ponder-
ous as the hilarity of his assistants increased.
" Is, the name, style, title, and temporal desi
nation of thy outward corporality, Peter Rust?"
he inquired, with the utmost seriousness.
"Which ?" quoth Peter.
Martin Broadbent repeated his question with
scrupulous precision.
"I never denied my name," said -Peter,
" though a namesake of mine, once on a time,
told a monstrous and cowardly lie."
" Then thee will come along."
Then to his aids:
"If he comes not peaceably, lay violent hands
on him, and constrain him with the strong
arm."
"If I must submit to this unlawful proceed-
ing, I'll make a virtue of necessity, and go
quietly. But I shall .hold ye, Mr. Overseer,"
Peter added, "responsible for this treatment.
With your born and bred gentleman I have no
business, that I know on, and don't care to have
any."
Rust cast a wishful look at his cabin, and was
pushed and jostled toward Lowenthal's, by hands
not over friendly. Ben Dykes lingered, and did
not overtake the party for some minutes. Peter
believed that the knave was looking for his
double gun, but held his peace.
CHAPTER IL
LOWENTHIAL.
While being hurried up the acclivity, he tried
to make conversation with Martin Broadbent,
but drew nothing satisfactory from him. That
a man .of his sober faith should be engaged in
such a questionable calling in the- cotton-fields
of South Carolina, was to him a subject of
astonishment.
The evening was considerably advanced when
Peter Rust was ushered into the house of Lo'i.

enthal. He cold not but notice, as he entered,
that the place was much like a military camp.
le saw, a little way off, shimmering in the
moonlight, a cluster of white tents, recently
pitched.
Lowenthal was a man between thirty-five and
forty years of age, six feet in height, compactly
built, features thin and dark, expression hard
and keen. Ambition, cunning, and misanthropy,
had made their respective writings on his face
and character.
Martin Broadbent, having conducted hima to
this siniister present,- withdrew' without re-
mark.
Peter Rust was six feet and two inches in
height, straight as his owf gun-barrels. ~ He
was never more rigidly perpendicular than when
Lowenthal was looking him over with his1 cold'
eyes. He bore the scrutiny with patient firm-
ness. While Lowenthal studied his man, Peter
studied his.
You were born at the North?" said Lowen-
thal, by and by.   '
"I might have been born at the South, had
my mother been there at the time," answered
Peter, dryly.
"Keep your Yankee wit till it's wanted," said
Lowenthal.
"I'll keep it at the door'in calling distance, in
ease there should be a demand fo- it. Poor
market for it here, I allow," replied Peter.
"For the work you're wan led for," resumed
Lowenthal, with composure, "Lincolnite, abo-
litionist, bloodtub, or -mudsill, are all, one to me.
It's not your brains I want but your greasy,
mechanical skill."
"Go on," said Peter.
"I am told," Lowenthal continued," that you
can turn your hand to any craft. I have sent
for you to put your'aptness touse. You needn't
speak. I1,do the talking myself."
Lowenthal rang a bell, then taking a revolver
from a case, slipped it into a side-pocket.
With wonderful quickness there appeared 'a
negro of such gigantic proportions, that Peter
Rust could do nothing but look 'at him. His
body was a great column of flesh that towered
ibove his own height like -an ebony' Colossus.
His head wasa mass of crispy heir, giving back-
round and moral support to an incredible sur-
face of face, com ounded of lip and nose, mix-
ed with cheek and chin, teeth and eyes, in a'very
'African manner. His sooty visage was scarred
and hacked in a disagreeable fashion. One of
his naked arms was branded--the letters, deeply:
printed in fire looking like letters of iron im.
bedded in the flesh.
"Babel," said Lowenthal, with a wave of the,
hand, "light us up."
The black, who had obviously been expecting
a summons, brought a large lamp which burned
with a clear and steady flame, and, without an-
swer, obeyed his mascr.

Peter followed the giant, and Lowenthal wa.-
ed behind, thus placing Peter between the two.
He went forward firmly, for his nerves were not
easily disturbed.
They.ascended a flight of steps in a remote
part of the mansion, passed through an upper
hall, and finally mounted another staircase.
Peter wAs surprised at the capaciousness of the
house, which, when viewed from the outside,
did not appear 'so spacious. Babel paused at
the door of a room just under the roof, which
was barely high enough for him to stand erect.
With the broad, red flame of the lamp falling
on 'his pug-nose, and two banks of 'lips, and the
white rims of his eyes, he looked as much like
8atan ds anything Peter could think of.
" Go ini!' said Lowenthal.
Babel shuffled in.
Peter crossed the threshold, dubiously, and
found himself in an apartment about ten feet by
sixteen, having two narrow windows and a 'sky-
light ; the latter being so arranged that, by
stepping in a chair, a person of ordinary height
could reach a looped cord by which it couldbe
raised or lowered as ventilationrequired.
" You see those windows and the roof-light ?,,
said Lowenthal.
Peter Rust replied that he did.
" Now look to your left. You see these cook
joists-don't you ?"
" I see 'em," said Peter.
"Very well. With those oaken bars you tire
to seal u'p those windows, strengthen this dour,
-and repair the weak places in the walls."
"If I agree to r" muttered Peter.
"There is but one. will in this house," con-
tinued Lowenthal, hmperiously, "' and that is
-mine'!"
He made a motion 'to the black, who, placing
the lamp in a wooden brackeb went to a little
closet that had, till then, 'escaped Peter's no-
tice, and thence took a gun, with a short brass
barrel and bass mountings. The calibre of
this ancient .fire-arm was such that a hand of
moderate size might have been thrust in at the
muzzle. Under ordinary circumstances, Peter
would have smiled at sight of it ; but matters
were growing too serious for smiling.
" Is it loaded ?" asked Lowenthal, using his
right arm as if it were a ramrod.
Babel nodded his woolly globe of a head,sand
held up four fingers, to signify 'that there were
four balls in the blunderbuss. He then; opened
the powder-pan, to show that the piece was
primedd.
Peter lost nothing of this dumb show.
"Stand at this door," added Lowenthal, in an
even, inflexible voice. " This mnudsill is not to
go till the work is done. If he attempts to force
his way hence, shoot him.".
Peter remarked that as often as Lowenthal
addressed the black, he gesticulated in a singu-
lar manner, and that Babel kept his eyes stead-

fastly fastened on his lips. He .seemed to speak.
from the force of hagit, but to gestieulate for
the niegro's apprehension.
" Is this the way you gesier'ly get .your work-
done :" Peter demanded, meeting. the eyes of
Lowenhnalgfirmly.
The latter po ted '-zthe 1i 'ber ar&amp; ie

expression. T was easy to see at.  ad een

door.                  ..

common life. You havenade a mistake :about:
my handiness, ingenuity, and, all 'tuit:' 'Seein'
the whole thing's a blunder, 'Il'go my way and
say no more on't."
'eter 'Rust watched the, effec'(f' his words,'
but they passed over the stern surfaee of Low-
enthal like the lightest zepIyr over a frozen
lake.  The still-hunter might as wellhave
thrown up a window and dropped liis asyer out1
out of it.
"You're down among the ,nudsls,",answer-
ed Lowenthal,.with no apparent increase of im-'
patience; -but'the tenor of his voice was bard"
as iron. " Never lived drudging  Yankee' that
couldn't do whatever was wanted. Hammers
and planes, chaffering -and gains, are their nat-
ural weapons and aspiations. As their fathers
were, so are they. Work !'
1 The white hand of the planter went quivering
toward the windows again.
The cheeks of Peter Rust burned red, at first ;
then they paled'slow.ly  Thire was something,
like white lightning flickering in his eyes.
"I am but a simple-minded man," he said,
"and know little more than simple honesty. I
s'pose tools and work are 'well enough in their
way, but a deal too common for born gentle-
men. You people down, here couldn't have
housen to live in, if 'twasn't for Northern brains
and Northern planes. You'd be obleeged to
sleep under the open sky, with your slaves, if
you had to trust to your own bone and muscle.
But what's bone and muscle? Bone and mus-
cle isn't for born gentlemen and born ladies, of
course ! Bone and muscle is for niggers and
Northern workers !"
Peter looked down at the floor, and compress,
ed his lips. Ile needed wonderful self-power to,
govern his feelings, but he struggled for the vic-
tory, and obtained it.
Lowenthi1's lip curled scornfully, but he
vouchsafed no:other reply. He paused on the
threshold, as he passed Babel, and said, touching
his lips and his breast:
AGive him   neither food nor drink till the
work is done. When it is completed, inform me."

The giant jerked his head like a great black
audton.

'MILROSE; OR, THE COTT
There was a slight, a very slight sound some-
where ; it was the 'soft rustle of a garment, and
the gentle slipping of a foot on the floor. Peter
Rust felt, rather than saw, a presence, at first;
but, looking over Batel's head, his eyes were
greeted with an unexpected sight. It was some-
thing altogether mortal, however. It was a
young woman of sixteen or seventeen years,
who stood gazing at him over the squat figure
of the black, with a terrified and wondering ex-
pression. Her face, neck, and hands were white
as a lily. .
Peter spoke not, nor wished to. Never had
feminine shape so surprised him. He was real-
ly very practical and unimaginative ; but odd
fancies for a moment disturbed him. The clear,
singularly earnest eyes, with the dark and beau-
tifully-arched line of brows above them pen-
ciled so exquisitely on the snowy skin, bewil-
dered his simple nature, and confused his natu-
rally calm mind. Had the souls of young girls
lived in lilies, the pearly whiteness of her com-
plexion would not have astonished him. He
had always supported the common-place phi-
losophy that flesh was flesh, and clay was clay.
But here was a pretty piece of humanity that
entirely upset his theory.
The circumstances, the hour, the terror,
timidity, and beauty of the white-robed visitor,
all had their effect on Peter, who knew not
whether to advance or retreat, speak or remain
silent. Babel was the stumbling-block. Babel
was between them. Babel banned his tongue.
Babel was a black doubt ; a miserable uncer-
tainty.                                '.
Being an honest and well-meaning man, he
put his hand on his heart, and stood respect-
fully before the girl, who appeared as much at
a loss as himself, besides beingtfrightened.- ' He
knew that young women did not tremble with-
out cause, and his good sense immediately sug-
gested one.
Was the negro asleep?  Was he really deaf,
sleeping pr waking?
The brain is inventive under difficulties.
With chalk, he wrote, in large letters, on a
piece of stuff :
"Is this for you ?"
He held the writing up in, the light of the
lamp. ..
She read the words and seemed distressed,
but made no sign. He wrote again:'
"It is a prison."
She moved her head affirmatively.
" Iam working against my will."
She smiled faintly, and assented as before.
Peter understood her as well as if she had
said : " I know it ; I know it."
" What have you done ?" he wrote. ,
She clasped her hands and looked silently
upward-.
" I'll swear that you never harmed a human

being I" he wrote. A grateful glow suffused
her features.
" For love!"
Peter scratched this question on the rough
beard with some hesitation, and was sorry when
he held it up-that he had been so bold. He
was treading delicate ground.
The girl's incomparable whiteness did not
change much. There was a slight smile, and
a momentary drooping of the eyes, and no
more.
Peter did not feel answered. He stroked his.
board, as if he had been guilty .of an offence,
and wrote :
"For money ?"
He watched her eagerly.
She stood unresponsive an instant, glanced
apprehensively at Babel, sighed, and Peter be-
lieved it was Yes.
He was at a loss what to do next ; coaxing
his invention a moment, his countenance be-,
came animated. He wrote:
" Can I help you ?"
She shook her head doubtfully.
"Is the black deaf ?" he added.
.She nodded quickly.
"Then why not-" began Peter, in a low
voice. A warning gesture, and a terrified look
stopped him of a sudden. Poor Peter was
dreadfully perplexed.
Her startled manner convinced him that he
had been guilty of an indiscretion. Her small
hands thrust toward him deprecatingly, made
him feel like a criminal.
'She now seemed in the attitude of listening,
but to what, he could not tell, for he heard
nothing. While standing expectant, wondering
what next would happen she flitted from the
door, and out of sight.
Peter looked a moment at the spot where
he had last seen her, then fell to work indus-
triously, making a great clattering about the
ears of Babel, who, as far as he could discover,
was in no manner disturbed by the din. Rais-
ing his eyes presently, he saw Lowenthal at
the door, watching him.
The flight of. his mysterious visitor had led
him to anticipate the coming of this man.
From Peter he looked to the black, whose eyes
were still closed. Without a word, he raised a
small walking-cane which he had brought with
him, and gave him a cruel cut across the face.
The-negro sprang up, enraged, but seeing
Lowenthal, he gradually relapsed into his for-
mer stolidity, with the exception of an occa-
sional twitching of the muscles of his face.
"So you have' gone to work ?" said Lowen-
thal to Peter. '"I thought you would. Who
has been here ?"
Peter measured a stick, and began to saw.
" Who has been here I" repeated Lowenthai,
frowning.

Peter's voice, as he proceeded, took on , more
and mor- an earnest and impressive tone. There
was a kind of quiet solemnity in. his enuncia-
tion. Lowentlial never felt so strangely in his
life. le knew not what he had caged.

free gift of Mother Natur'-and that's all I've
got to stake agin your undisputed authority.
There ! Now:I allow that you know some'at
about Peter Rust."
Peter ceased, and waited some time for am
answer. When Lowenthal spoke,. his voice was
steadier and calmer than before, but far more
dangerous.
"It does not become my rank and station,"
he said, " to waste time and words on a low-born
fellow.  Slow-i racker and still-hunter as you
are, I don't think you'll be able to slow-track pr,
still-hunt your way out of my dwelling back to
your beggarly barrens!".
Peter Rust looked through a' small hole in
the door, that he had made for that purpose,
and saw the planter cock a revolver and direct
its muzzle to a panel, then waited, evidently,
for him to speak.
Peter didn't speak, but, stepping out of range,
tapped on the panel with a stick.
Thinking Peter's body was where the sound
was, Lowenthal let fly, a ball, which, tearing'
through the door, went out at the window, op-
posite..
Peter sprang upward as far as be could for,
the ceiling, and came down, sprawling,.near the'
door. Everything in the room rattled with the
shock.   ~.
Lowenthal put up his pistol and listened.. It
seemed to him that he had done mischief;
but that didn't disturb his equanimityat all.
He was used to doing mischief. He had shot
runaways often, and winged a few Union men of
late.

He beard no sound,; and concluding that Pe.
ter was very dead or very deceitfull, he went
slowly down-stairs to his breakfast.
CHAPTER VI.
SWAMPSEY.
Peter Rust, being neither hit n(r hurt.arose.
It was- now 4 plain matter of deadly enmity be--
tween 1.owenthal and, himself. The inteitions.
of the planter, there was, no longer room to
doubt. But;Peter did xnt regret ,speaking his
mind. Ie; felt ,less' lie; a hypocrite, and more
like a.-man); ages:safety, and more ,etermina-
tion.
The, way the case ,tood, it was a question of
egpapq, or something worse.. Exchange, places,
in imagination,,w;ith Peter, and. the difficulties
apd embarrassments will be, better apprehend-
ed. The windows were a long way from the
ground.  One could not drop from -them, like
Biruin from a treenand run away unhurt. There
was a poor chance of escaping in that direction
without.an outside assistant. Ire looked down-
ward wishfully, and that was all he could do.
He raised the skylight, then drawimgg the
chest along, and placing some lumber on it, he
mounted high enoug    to examine the roof,
which had a pitch so sharp as to render walking
upon it unsafe.. There was a light iron paling
just back of the gutters, but it looked as if a
slide against it would eariy it away.
Theview before Peter was not a cheerful one.
There were the slippery tiles that no feet could
standupon; tiere.was the oblique surface, with
nothing for the hands to grasp ; there was the
increasing velocity, when one got started ; and
belowwas the fatal fall, with, seemingly, nothing
but acobweb between.to prevent it.
Peter Rust did. not wish to break his neck to,
save his life ; but he i'esolved to trust himself
on the roof :assoon.as it was dark, if no 'more
feasible method presented. He would have
made the trial then, had not, the whole, planta-
tion peep astir. It was fortunate for him that
he exposed so little of his person ; for just 'as
he was witidraiving, he discovered Ben Dykes
lurking suspiciously about the grounds.
"The lazy ;villain !" muttered Peter. "He's
got a hankerin' after my double-gun."'
Peter dren .phis ,head, closed the skylight,
and continued his observations from the win-.

CHAPTER VII.
WANT HIM GOT OUT!
With the night came clouds, and with the
clouds, darkness. Both clouds and darkness
seemed to favor the intentions of Milrose.. An-
geline had been faithfully busy.- Such. parcels
as she could comfortably carry had been made
up, and been put out of sight, ih readiness for
flight; and mistress and naid waited in much
agitation for the hour of dejparture. The enter-
prise was not without romantic coloring. .Robe
had been wonderfully suggestive, and Angeline
equally wonderful in execution.
The latter had succeeded in obtaining, 'by
much finesse, the uniform of a drummer-boy for
the disguise of her mistress, and, by the same
happy management, the second suit of a youth-
ful trumpeter, who had been somewhat intoxi-
cated, by her beauty and -two 'glasses of Bour-

two chairs, Milrose was looking at with very
wide eyes.
Laws, Miss Milly! They- won't hurt yet
these things won't.. Needn't be queer 'bout'em.
You'll look jest as .handsome as you, can live !
Can't make ye look ugly, anyways."
In spite of these friendly assurances, Milrose
stared a greatdeal at the gray jackets and
trowsers, and the jaunty fatigue-eaps. Could
she ever get used to such comical things?
"Love o' God !' exclaimed Angeline, putting
her hand suddenly on Milrose's head. " What's
to be done with this hair? I done forgot it."
" Can't ,you arrange it somehow, Angeline ?"
asked Milrose, with a startled look.
"Bless ye, no, mistress ! There's more'n two
eapfuls of it. And such hair ! It's finer'n silk,
and blaeker'n Babel's wool. Can't fix it, no-
ways -"
"Cut it off," answered Milrose, with an ex
eusable sigh ; for her hair was incomparably
beautiful.
"Can't do it, Miss Milly, anyways! IHaint

cerls. Tell 3 ou what, it's wicked. True's I
live, 'twould be designationI"
"Designation, or' desecration, I must submit
Ito it. Get your scissors, and begin."
Wouldn't tried to make ye a boy, if 'spected
this !" muttered Angeline, most unwillingly be-
gmning to clip the long and shining locks.
.1 No boy ever had such hair. Coarse stuff,
boy's hair is  Declar' I feel like a manefactor!
To think how many would go crazyfor this hair!"
The dark tresses fell one after another. An-
geline fetched a great sigh at every stroke of her
scissors. It appeared to her that their troubles
had really begun.
"I heard something," said Milrose.
"So did I; I heard my heart thumping' with
grief, and the clip, clip of these horrid scissors!"
responded Angeline,.petulantly.
It wanls at the window. I wish you'd open
it," said Milrose, uneasily.
." In half a minute, mistress. 'Most done,"
replied the girl, lingering.to complete the sac-
rifice. She had severed the last curl, and was
in the act of obedience, when the window was
softly pushed up from the outside, and a little
blae boy, in a tow shirt, appeared, standing in
the open space between the sash and the floor.
This little black boy was Swampsey; and he
had his hands behind him. But this little black
boy, with his hands behind him, made as much
sensation as if he had been as large as the giant
of Gath. Two pairs of bright eyes turned their
fires on Swampsey. Two pretty faces paled with+
fear, and mistress and maid thought they were
betrayed...
" Want him got out!" said Swampsey., Not
a muscle of his small body moved.
Milrose and Angeline began to breathe, and
look at each other.

ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.
Swampsey waited a reasonable time.
" Want him got out !"
"Love o'-God!" cried Angeline.
" Want -him got out !" repeated Swampsey.
"He waits him got out !" echoed Angeline
with the blankest of faces.
"Wan't whom got out ?" asked Milrose.
"' Mars'r Peter!"
The voice seemed to come from an infant
sepulchre.. It was low-pitched, and straight on
It was a serious matter with Swampsey.
" Mars'r Peter ?" queried Angeline, yet in th
dark.
" Up yon !" said Swampsey, jerking his he
upward,.,,
" Peter Rust !" exclaimed Milrose, rapid]
connecting several fractional facts.
Instantly Swampsey threw two forward sce
ersets to the centre of the room, cut a caper o
-hisown invention, and clapped his hands lhe
him again-
Milrose was amazed.' This was her first ac
quaintanee with Swampsey.
1' Gracious.! what a frog it is ! Didn't kno
there was such a little straddle-bug on th
plantation."
Swampsey winked and blinked.
"Tell you what, too," continued Angeline
" Shouldn't wonder if this was the little blac
midget that follows Peter of the Pines."
Swampsey's grave head. bobbed up and
down.
" Want him got out," he said, with an eye to
business.
" He's your master ?" asked Milrose.
"Mars'r Peter!" answered Swampsey.
" I, can't help your master, little fellow,"
said:Rose. "I wish I could, but I can't."
Swampseywinked vacantly. He could rde
understand her inability. He studied her face
most wishfully, as dogs look at their masters t
know their minds.
"What's your name, you curious chicken ?'
demanded Angeline.
" Swampsey," replied the boy, with a double
wink.
" Laws ! Swampsey !" said Angeline.  " Sh
can't git him out, anyways."
The features of Swampsey remained hope
lessly vague ana unsatisfied.
" Can't git herself out, you little stupid nig
ger ! Shut up here, we be, as if we's fightin
Fed'ralists. Go 'way !"
Swampsey somersaulted back to the window-
sill. It was a sign that he had an idea.
"Want a rope !" he. said, when he ha
crossed his hands behind him again.
"Go 'long, with your-tow shirt!"

darkness. While Angeline fumbled at the lock,
heavy footsteps crossed the garden, and came
deliberately to the door.
Milrose caught Angeline by the shoulders
and drew her closely to the wall. Her mind, in
an emergency of this kind, acted quicker than
that of her maid.
,-1A key was fitted to the look ; the bolt was
turned ; the door was opened ; the key was
withdrawn- and placed on the other side of the
lock ; while the person who did these things
came in, closed and relocked the door, and went
creaking gp-stairs, leaving the two runaways in
a painful suspense.
Milrose's tact alone had prevented discovery ;'
for when the door swung open, they were nes-
tled in a very small corner behind it. Deliber-
ately the thick brogans went, up.

The lumbering steps were now in the hail
above ; and the girl, while she was speaking,
turned the key and opened the door. They
quickly passed out, and, with little chills of
fear, found themselves in the dreary darkness.
CHAPTER IX.
MARS R     PETER.
When Peter Rust could no longer see Swamp-
sey, he felt more lonely than ever. It was some
comfort to look at the little black fite that
had followed him so long and so faithfully tum-
bling about on the grass.
Feeling about in the tool-chest, he found a
chalk-line. Slipping the looped end over his
finger, he dropped the reel from the window,
ii         which went whirling and unwinding to the
ground. He feared, as it swirled downward,
that it was not long enough ; but when it was
all run out, he was pleased to discover that he
could fathom  the distance.  Taking a turn
:around a nail, he let it hang there-p1iling at
it occasionally, as if he were fishing for foun-
ders.  It was his magnetic connection - his
Swampsey telegraph.
Peter Rust sat there, musing, hour after hour.
The absence of Lowenthal still perplexed him;
but Babel he could hear, at intervals, shuffling
to and fro in the passage.
The large lamp hung unlighted and dark in
the bracket. He had the means of lighting it ;
but he preferred the unlighted prison, nor cared
to make himself' a better target. He had re-
solved to defer his attempt to escape till a late
hour ; and it required the exercise of no little
self-control to remain passive till then.
Bobbing at the line, by-and-by lie thought lie
had coaxed a bite ; for it had grown heavier.
He began. to pull in, and the resistance grew

more palpable. Up and up came the line, a: d
up and up went Peter's curiosity. When, hand
over hand, Peter had drawn in all -the line, the
cause of the extra weight appeared in the form
of a rope knotted to the reel. Seizing the end
of the rope, Peter tied it to a stout joist, which
he placed across the window in a trice--then
paused to think.
"It can't be the little chattel," he muttered.
" Swampsey wouldn't never think of a rope.
He's chock full o' somerset ; but there isn't no
contrivance in him. - If he could git me out by
stannin' on his head, or unj'intin' his legs, or
by any kind of a; trick that has a good 'eal o'
squirm in it, he'd do it. But a rope ! Oh no !
Couldn't git a rope out of him. I've got a
friend somewhere 'round, and the bein's above
only know who 'tis; for I don't. Can't think
of nobody in this mis'rable, rebellious, king-
eotton country that'd go a step out of his way to
do me a good turn."
Peter reflected; but memory refused to quick-
en him. He examined the rope. It was rather
small, -but .new and strong. He believed he
might'safely trust his weight upon it. It would
be hard clinging to it; but Peter had seasoned
palms and tough fingers.
He glanced out to see how far he could fol-
low the white track of the cord. His eyes'
traveled about fifteen feet, andwere thrown off
the track by a black object that looked like a
football.  Over this football Peter puzzled a
moment ; but when he saw it moving upward,
he understood. It was Swampsey, climbing the
rope ! Swampsey, pushing up through the dark-
ness ! Swampsey, dancing in the air, like a cork-
on a trout-line!, Swampsey, swimming like a
frog and'mounting like a monkey ! Swampsey,
not i the least disturbed, pausing now and then
to, swing by one hand, or hang by his flexed
legs, head downward.
Peter was mute with wonder. He shivered
somewhat, too, at the wild antics of the boy.
He drew back, expecting to hear him drop up-
on the ground, and was going to speak to him
sharply to make him cautious, when the black
head shot up above the window-sill. For an
instant the pigmy elbows rested on the sill, and
the serious little face was turned upon Peter.
The attitude and the expression touched Peter.
He stared at Swampsey.
" Mars'r Peter !"
There was infinite content on his still fea-
tures.
Peter caught him by the arms and drew him
in, and set him on his feet with surprising.
quickness.
Swampsey straightened up his yard of length,
clapped his hands behind him, and said:
"Mars'r Peter !"
The two words were very simple, but they
spoke the one sentiment of the boy's life-love
for Peter.

The white six feet two, looked down benignly
at the three feet nothing in.the tow shirt.
"Poor-Swampsey ! queer little nigger !"
Peter's voice was kind, and there was a note
of pity in it.
"I was afeard you'd break your neck."
Swampsey joggled his head, to see if his neck
was right. t-.                        ,
"'Taii't broke, I guess; but you might broke
it," continued Peter. " But who put ye to
coming' up? Who got the rope and tied it on ?"
" Tole lies. Stole rope. Help Mars-r Peter,"
answered Swampsey, in his straight-on style.
" What, alone ? Well, leavin' out the lyin'
and stealin', which comes nat'ral to niggers,
that's extr'ordiner ! There's more in that tow-
shirt than-there looks to be. It'll hold, Is'pose
--won't it ?"
Peter took hold of the rope, and Swampsey
nodded violently.
" Then slide down,,little nig, and I'll be after
ye in no time.. Go keerful, and don't stop to
Cut shines."
Swam psey sprang to the window-sill, and was
out of sight in a moment.
Peter followed him more leisurely, and, after
some dangerous swinging, reached the ground
safely, but with wounded and smarting fingers.
He paused an instant to breathe, glanced at the
house with a quiet smile, and stalked silently
away, with Swampsey running at his heels.
CHAPTER X.
FLIGHT.
Hurrying across the cultivated ground, shun-
ning the negro quarters, choosing thb shaded
walks, and stepping softly, mistress and maid
left Lowenthal behind. The plans of the fugi-
tives were not very definite. They hoped to
find temporary shelter in the lut of a poor'
white, and on the following day put' in practice
those somewhat crude schemes which they had
talked over.
Angeline resorted to a singular expedient to
entertain Milrose on the way ; she related vari-
ous startling things that had happenedin the
ine woods, and on the borders of the planta-
tions. These tales did not increase the young
lady's courage. Her imagination became so
excited that she momentarily expected to have
a frightful adventure. She often detected her-
self looking to the right and left-for some un-
welcome object, and involuntarily holding her
breath to listen for footsteps. She was finally
obliged to rebuke the untimely volubility of
Angeline.           a
Although the darkness covered her flight,
Milrose's situation was so new that its gloom
constantly made her shiver. She had trodden
those winding paths in sunshine only, whd'n
there was no occasion for fear,; but that night
reversed everything, and turned another leaf in
her life.

They reached a cabin standing among some
trees. -They might easily have passed without
seeing it, had not the- footpath led directly to
the door.
" What is this ?" asked Milrose.
" Peter Rust lives here, Miss Milly. We can
go in and rest a minute or two, if you like.
You breathe kinder hard, that's cl'ar."
" Poor Peter !" saiI Rose.
" Laws, Mistress, lie's a Yankee I Ain't no
'count, nohow l" answered Angeline, slighting-
ly. "Got no plantation. Own's no niggers, he
don't. Isn't much s'perior to Ben Dykes, and
them."
Angeline resolutely pushed open the door,
and Milrose reluctantly followed her in. With-
in, nothing was appreciable but darkness. Rose
paused, afraid to step. Angeline, less timid,
went feeling and stumbling about.
" Here's a stool, honey ; sit down, and don't
be flurried. Won't nothin' hurt ye. Jest- as
safe as Mars'r Dan'l was amongg the lions."
"I cannot think ~ of stopping in this dark
place. We may not be alone," answered Milrose.
"hLaws! nobody here.. Nobody'd be likely to
be here. 'cept that little toddlepole. Could
wring his neck quieker'n you could 'blow-out a
candles'"
" I was told that I could trust this Peter Rust,"
said Milrose, reflectively.
"You can't trust a man that's shut up in a
construction. Stands to reason ! 'Nother-thing,
he ain't no company-for a forn lady that owns,
a heap o''niggers. Ought to practice a deal o'
circumflection 'bout your s'eiety,' said the girl,
oracularly.
My position is certainly enviable !" laughed
Milrose. " What do yon suppose I am worth,
girl ?"
" Eight or ten million, I'spect. Laws I I
don' know. May be more'n that," replied An-
geline, promptly.
"You have strange notions of figures," said
Milrose, amused in-spite of herself. I am, real-
ly, but a poor runaway. I have so little money
in my purse, tha' I shall be obliged to pawn my
jewelry ; a necessity that I shall yield to as soon
as I can find a money-changer."
"Bless ye ! 'spect I knows one that ar' kind
o' folks. Mars'r goes to him to get money. I
done found that out myself. Sells money.
Queer !"
Angeline stopped to think about selling mo-
ney.
" He lives.a long  tretch from the plantation,
though," she added. " Curis name, too. Mark-
thaler, 'tis. Mars'r Lowenthal's been to him
more'n once. Mighty cross when he- goes to
Markthaler's, and mighty set up when he comes
home."
" To-morrow, Angeline, you must take me to
the town where this usurer liver. I am surpris-
ed that you know-so much about my mother's

26             MILROSE; OR, THE COTT(
husband. You, must have been very observing{
or very meddlesome. If all waiting-maids were
like you, masters and mistresses would have few
secrets."
" Can't help it ! Eyes and ears wasn't made
for nothin'.. Mine wasn't, leastways."
" Come, Angeline !  I don't like this dark.
p lace. Lead me, if you can, to the poor white
family you spoke of."
Milrose groped her way out. Then the fugi-
tive pair joined hands and walked on.
Fairly in the forest, new fears assailed them.
The barrens abounded with wild animals, which
might lurk in their path. Then there were oth-
er creatures, of the Ben Dvkes order, to be no
less dreaded. As they passed under the lofty
arches of the pines, these dangers, to their dis-
turbed minds, drew nearer. Keeping closely
together, they hastened forward in silence. An-
geline's garrulity was tamed ; and Milrose half
regretted that she had not remained at Peter's
cabintill the day began to dawn. But that was
too near the prison she was flying from,.and
that truth gave strength to her feet and. firmness
to her will. Lowenthal was a greater terror
than beasts of prey or, the starless gloom of
night. She urged on her companion, whose
fears equaled her own, but whose mind had less
force, and whose actions had a feebler impelling
motive.
They heard dull and distant sounds in the
forest. Angeline wished to turn back ; Rose,
more practical, stopped to listen.
" I declar' for't, Miss Milly, my courage is
done gone ! If them ain't catamounts a comm',
it'll be the mercy o' God !" said Angeline.
" You've not a particle of reason," answered
Milrose. " A wild beast wouldn't come upon
us with such a clatter as that. It would creep
without noise, or lie in wait and spring on us
before we had warning of danger."
" Tell you what ! that's worse than 'tother
way.   Creep, creep, ereep !  Crawl, crawl,
crawl! Seems as if I could hear one this min-
ute, coming' without a bit o' noise."
" Your sense and courage have gone togeth-
er, Angeline," Rose replied. "Do be quiet.
That which makes no noi-i cannot be heard.
The sounds that you can really hear are made
by horses, and not by dangerous beasts. Do
you not hear the iron thud ;.I their feet?"
"I do b'lieve 'tis. Laws, yes! And there's
folks ridin' 'em. Knew 'tw!" i't nothin'.. You
git seared dreadful easy, Mis-. Milly."
Angeline was now very bra+'s.
" Tole ye there's folks on Wu," she went on.
" Can ;hear 'em talk. Been  ire in the day-
time, time and time ag'in, and never was the
leastest natom seared. Don't br'ue ye for be-
in' flustered, though. It looked eone pokerish
for a spell."       ,
The voices of persons could now be plainly
heard, and Lo4enthal's among them.

MILROSE ; OR' THE' COTTON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.

ON-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.
"Tell you what ! there's marer's voice," add-
ed the voluble maid. "Shouldn't wonder if
he's pursuitin' of us."
" if he was pursuing us, he would be quite
likely to come. from' the opposite direction,"
Milrose sharply replied.,
" So he would, come to think!d Shouldn't,
meet him if he's follerin' after us. You've got,
a head-piece, anyways."
" Let's get out of the path," said Rose. " He
is near, and my heart beat's fast, in spite of
me."
Milrose and the girl glided from the path and
sat down among the pines. The former, al-
though there was not much danger of discovery,
exaggerated what there was, and awaited the
passing of Lowenthal with anxiety. le ap-
proached, talking fiercely of the war. He, and
those with him, were excited with liquor. Like
all persons more or less intoxicated, they were
pot-valiant. They defied their Northern foes ;
and said they would make every battle-field a
Bull Run. There would be a large -crop of
Bull Runners. The new army on the Potomac
was but a Manassas egg, that would soon yield
a nestful of Bull Run chickens. Thus they
made merry.
Then they spoke, of a rumored invasion of
Port Royal, and hoped the Yankees would soon
appear, so that they might give them a taste of
Southern steel. The would make the invaders
bow to King Cotton  eore they were half ,done
with them.
Had they not traveled slowly and'talked loud'
ly, as vaunters are wont, Milrose could not hairO
heard so much. Their words were audible both
before and after they had passed, and the last-
distinct sentences she heard were bitter fulmina-
tions against spies and informers, whom they
intended to deal with most summarily.
Milrose made no effort to see Lowenthal ani
his companions. Sitting silently under the
branches, shrinking and fearful, she was content
to be passed unnoted. But Angeline, having
more curiosity, stretched up her neck, and
availed herself of every opening in the foliage'
to look after them. Had not the clouds lifted
a little, she would have seen absolutely nothing.
But a. spectral spray of light, falling through
an embrasure above, came opportunely to-her
aid. She protested, after hoofs and voices went
out'of hearing, that she had seen the parties go
by, and that on\ one of the horses sat a young
man with his hands tied behind him.'- This per-
son, she declared, rode with his head down, and
had a dispirited look generally.
"Your eyes," said lIilrose, "must have bees
sharper than they, were a while since."
"Laws, Miss Mill ! Don't s'pose I'd pere.
ventricate, do ye ? Got one good look at 'em,
and that's the truth. A little ribbon o' light
come down through a hole in the clouds, and
that's the way I got a peep at 'em. Tell yot

27

'what.! They hada prisoner, and:his arms was
opinionated ahind him.''}
"Describe him,"-said Milrose,.cincredulously.
"And, to save timed 'let' us walk on."
" Can't 'scribe him much.' Only got a glim-
mer Hof him, you know. Couldn't see his physi-
ology very well. Was, dressed- in blacks citi-
zen's clothes, he was. H'e had black hair and a
black cap, and I shouldn't wonder .but he was
handsome. He wasa, pavilion, anyways."
" Goodness ! E civilian, Angeline."
"Laws! -means the same: thing. He wa in
trouble, leastways. He 'got daohis horse like an
anthomaston, and a more injected repression I
never see. Tell ybu what, 'twas some Union,
ambolition traitor that they've got hold of!"-
Although Milrose. was not',inclined.-to 'give
full credit to the girl's eyesight,-she was much
troubled by her description of ' the 'prisoner,
whom she could not help connecting, in some
unaccountable manner,:with Frederick North.
If that young man had fallen 'into -such bad
hands, the worst might be -anticipated. - She
tied to believe that 'he had  not only' es-
caped the pistol of 'Lawenthal, but, all subse-
quent perils. Thinking these thoughts,.turning
over a hundred' things in her mind, making and
unmaking predicaments, starting at , every
sound, walking, now hurriedly,- now slowly
looking not backward, with her eyes fixed -64
the black and thread-like vista through which.
the pathway ran, she did het.best for escape
and liberty..
CHAPTER XI.
IN THE FOREST.
For some time they.could feel the path with
their feet. A hard indentation, distinctly ap-
preciable, assured them that they were follow-
ing. a beaten track.' Imperceptibly' this little
foot-groove grew shallower and less apparent,
.and by-and-by it was lost ; but the trees stood
so far apart, and the, way was so unobstructed,
that the fugitives did not immediately perceive
.that they were walking where there was no
path. The pine patriarchs loomed up grandly
around them. .Soft, balsamic odors impregna-
ted the quiet air.
Milrose paused. The forest was a cathedral.
The pine odor was the incense, swung silently'
to and fro before the altar, by the hand of Na-
ture. Milrose was awed, yet tranquilized. The
vail of darkness drawn 'over the woods had
,moresignificance and 'less terror. This tem-
porary calmness.made her bear with more for-
titude the discovery which she now- made that
they had lost the friendly guide: that, had led
,hem on with bopefuhless and tolerable courage.
11Where is the path ?" Milrose asked.
"'The Lord, he only knows, mistress! It's
done gone. Never was so turned round."  An.'
geline felt and looked vainly for the path.

"Think you can find the hut yod spoke oxd$"
asked Rose, nervously.
' "Might-as well hunt fdr a pigeon's egg !" an-
swered the:girl. ",Fact is, I'm el'ar run. out.
Don' know which way to go. S'pect we're lost,
and shall have to stay in, the woods all night,
anyways. Thought l'se derd sure of the way.
If the wild critters don't eat us, and we don't
starve to death, and notlyin' happens to us, we
ahall-do well 'nough."
Angeline tried to speak with all the courage
the situation required, and as it appeared, with
far more than she possessed ;' for Milrose could
hear her teeth chattering.,
"So.you advise us to give up ?";said Milrose,
who had long since arrived at 'the conclusion
that she must trustingn herself and not in..Ange-
line.
"Don' know what's.the good tryin'. Better
set down and save ours strength, than to :he
walkin' 'bout. ''Sides, Miss hilly, my courage
is, jest snoozin' out, o' my fingers-ends. But
don't. be in a state o' perpetration, my dour
mistress.. We can't be more'n killed, anywai;s.
All gotito bekilled; sometime. Fed'rals '11 ill
us, 'if- mars'r; don't.  Won't be nothin' liut
killin' and ravagin' for the next few months."
With this cheerful view of .things, Angelipe
dropped upon the ground in Utter .desolation.
Perplexed assshe was, Milrose could not lint
smile at the ludicrous hopelessness of her at.
tendant.
"'Peers like I canhear 'em ereepin' 1" she et n-.
tinued, her mind running on every species of
dangers.
" Get up, and come along I" said Milrose,
sharply.
" Can't, Miss Milly !.My limbs are jest 'tcn-
alyzed with fright; and that's thu truth."
Milrose was now obliged to exert her author.
ity.
Perceiving :that, her mistress was in: earnest,
Angeline arose and followed her,, wondering
that she' should be so brave.
Trusting to her judgment, Mdose struck off
through the more open partof the forest.with a
strong resolution not to give up: She had ob-
served that the ground gradually ascended as
they receded from the plantation, and fell off
whenever they' approached it, and this peculi-
arity of 'the land:guided her. -er reason and
,sagacity proved more reliable than her maid ;
for after-walking about half an hour, they-were
cheered by-the- discovery of a hut.: Cheered?
Under. better circumstances, the word could
not have beenused. It was, in fact, a- most
miserable hut; a smoke-blackened, forlorn, and
thriftless hut, with all the mute yet eloquent
witnesses of sloth around it.
Milrcse's first emotions of joy subsided as she
silently stood and contemplated this wretched
abode. The clouds had drifted    away from
overhead, and the blurred light thrown on the

ney at one end, Puffs of pitchpine smoke' re-
volved .lazily froir the top of this chimney.
The attention of', Milrose was - unpleasantly
drawn from these 'matters by a great outcry of
dogs. There was- a dire uproar inside ; - a
scratching, whining, barking, howling, and yelp-
ing. Little dogs, and large dogs, hounds, curs,-
and terriers, small voices and big: voices,- and
anon a human voice, united in one grand-over-
ture.'
"uLove o' God " cried Angeline. '4,You've
taken me to Ben Dykes't1"
" Ben Dykes I" repeated Milrose, in conster-
nation.
" Ben Dykes, the dog-trainer; Ben Dykes,
the nigger-hunter ; Ben Dykes, the poor, good-
for-nothin' white ;trash !" muttered Angeline,
completely at fault.
"Hush)" whispered Milrose, he is opening
the door. I am afraid of those clamorous dogs.
It is too late to retreat. If we run, those sav-
age brutes will be after us.Now,e Angeline,
do try and be prudent. Remember that you
are a young man and belong to the army."
" Laws !" I cl'ar forgot I's a young man,"
said Angie. "And by the same ,token, you're
a boy, Miss Milly. I. s'pect the whole thing'll
leak out."       '
"Be silent! - Do not speak except when
spoken to, and then in the briefest, manner.
Watch and imitate me;" answered Milrose, hur-
riedy.
" What's the matter out yer !" cried D kes.
Down, pups, down ! Stop your bother. an't
hear my own talk. What's up, I say ?"
Ben Dykes seized 'two of the stoutest dogs by
the napes of theit necks, and held them, at the
same time kicking over a brace of cowardly,
yet noisy young bulls.
Milrose was going to reply ; but at the first
trial her voicefailed her.
" Who's thar ? Who's out yon?  I see ye,
hidin' in the dark !" shouted Ben. " Come out
o' that yer, or I'll let the dogs loose. Shouldn't
wonder if you's runaway niggers."
"You're mistaken, friend," said Milrose, ad-
vancing, and using the most masculine voice
she could make. It was not, the best article
in the market; it was inferior in quantity, if not
in quality. There should have been more of it.
" What you squeakin' about?   Toddle up
here, where I can see ye. Have ye got pistils'
and sieh ? Don't, try no shootin' game on 'me.
Jeff and Beau'! 1be onto ye, fast thing you dun-
no !" vociferated Ben, warningly, pinching the
dogs' necks to make them growl.
" Don't be afraid, sir !" added Milrose, walk-
ing cautiously among the canines." "It's our
business to protect, not to hurt people." She
said this with a condescension that quite sur-
Vrised herself.

ON-PLANTER'S 'DAUGHTER.
"Sager' fellerss 1: soger i1fellers !" muttered
Ben, as the two fictitious young fellows drew
near:. -".They must'bekdratted hard up for so-
gers, down yon.' -All I Cansay 'bout it is, that
they might made ye bigger. -Reckon you crawl
into the cannon to clean 'ern, and creep out

"Fine dogs, stitanger; fine dogs I" said Mil-

Angelinein beautiful masculine.

by the throat."     -.
Ben Dykes fetched a sigh from the bottom
of his thorax, in view of the awful depravit
of niggers. But his attention was now much
occu ped with his unexpeeted visitors.
"What kind o' killing' do you do, mostly,
,youngsters ?" he rather, sarcastically asked.
"Should think you might make the worst kind
of a panic in a poultry-yard. Got little straps
on your jacket, hadn't ye, bubby ! This other
cha 's got some on his'n, too. There ain't no
higer officers than you be-be there? As I
said afore,' all I've got to say is, they might

Mr. Dykes opened his mouth and laughed
a fearfully wide laugh.
"Tell ye what I'- there's something they
couldn't made bigger," .put in Angehine, in her
very successful masculine.
"Oh, you've pitched into iy Mouth, too!
Everybody pitches into my mouth !" snarled
Ben. "Darned if I can have my joke 'thout
gettin' a fling in the mouth. Keep out, young-
ster ! Tell ye to keep out !.
Milrose apologized for Angeline's personali-
ties, and' regretted that she had accidentally
disturbed.his repose.       ,l
" What weapons do ye carry ?"he asked, eye-
ing them curiously.
"Nothingrbut pistols, at present," Rose an-
swered, with well-acted ind ifference. " I. be-

added.
" Be shot if ever I see you down yer. Can't

"You've just hit it," replied Milrose, with
misgiving. " My friend is a trumpeter ; I beat

"You beat me, too. Hanged if you don't.

she perceived that it-should have been no. nBut
it was too late to mend it ; and She let it alone.
" Yer folks was very ekernomieal," continued
Ben. "Saves time, Tom does. Tom's a long
handle .'nough for a short boy." !
There never was such a thrilling in'her 'blood
before. Had this white Savage of the-pine' bar-
rens already penetrated her secret ?  If so, was
not her position perilous ? It was, unquestion-
ably. From hiscivilizationshe could-hope noth-
ing, because he was not civilized ;fromhis hon-
or nothing, for he had none ; from' his -honesty-
nothing, for he' had none' of that.   She longed
for the morning, Then she -thought that even
the light might be dangerous. -'So there wasono
end to her embarrassments; if there were, she,
knew not where to find it.
She 'looked to Angeline for strength; and was
cheered to see that she was behaving very well,
having, from habit, fewer scruples to: Contend
with than herself. ' Besides, she 'was the hardi-
est and best-skinned boy, and though she had
proved faint-hearted in the woods, was now more
at ease than her mistress. Perhaps the girl did
not see the danger, or, seeing it, put 'at wrong
estimate upon it.
The teething baby moaned, and flung its thin
arms restlessly about. Milrose, glancing pity-i
ingly at the woman, met her 'mournful gaze,
which, to her quick apprehension, grew to won-
der while she looked.
Some people's eyes seem stolen from the
brute-races, and express only the craft necessa-
ry to seize their piey, and provide for their dai-
ly--recurring 'appetites. "Sueh eyes had Ben'
Dykes;. 'Both eyes and instincts were for prey.,
And thus Rose interpreted them.
" Does Peter Rust live farfrom here'?" she in.,
quired.
"Peter ,of the pines V" said Ben,-,fishing a'
fractured pipe from-the stick-chimney, and rap-
ping the bowl on his thumb-nail. "Go up' you,
and, ask Lowenthal' about, him.' Them as can't.
say' 'Cotton is king' 'is no company'for me.""
- '" Tell ye what i" said Angelite, 'resolutely,
"it doesn't make the leasteat differenceto them-
that hasn't got no-cotton, nor no-niggers. You,
can't lose aheap, war or no-war.' ',You're- one
o' them poor whites that's jes' outside all!crea
tion. So what's the good talkin' ?"- j-
Although secretly glad to hear'this-rebuke,it
put Milrose in.a panic.
Ben filled his pipe, and thrust it into aconer
of- his mouth.
" Dick !!" he muttered. " Dick the-truhipeter.
That's youI" 'He' nodded toward Angeline: .
"A trifle larger bay 'nor Tom.- Longer' anl -

'totherwise, I inight.a had millions d'~hales o'

trumpet ag'in, if yer likes."
Ben bur-:ed .1:1' top of his iend -iii smoke.

His mouth, seen through the tobacco-fdgs, look-
ed. like a rift in the chimney.
"'Don't be -imipertinent to the gentlemakn,"
said Rose;- Wishing' to smooth "matters.
"Don't be worried, comrade. Know how to
take care of myself. Carry some'little fellows
under my jacket that are a heap o' company."
Angeline tapped herself on the breast with a
wise air.. "
"-We army chaps," she added, complacently;
" have' to be- right smart with pistols and things.
Shot 'a dozen times the other 'day at a soldier'i
cap,.and you could cover.the whole of 'em with
the palm of your hand. But that's nothin' to
what I could do-when I's in practice. Don't
want to hurt 'nobody, any ways." -Angeline
yawned, and appeared ve  much at ease.
'- The apathetic -eyes 'of rs. Dykes wandered
from Milrose"to Angeline. There was faseina-
tion in the voices of the delicate youths. What
associations, they awakened' in her lonely life,
none may know.
Ben inhaled his cheeks' 'full of smoke, and
blew it out- with-a great deal of-importance.' H
was .reparing to be belligerent.
" ''m Ben Dykes," quoth he. "Ben Dykes,

ragged arms deliberately, and wrinkled a threat-
ening frown from the'bridge of his nose to the
hair on his' forehead. "I'm a nat'ral suv'reign"

" Love o' God !" exclaimed Angeline. "'Pears
like you're the mainstay of this here resurrec-

you must go down with your pups. But it's
about time for Tom and I to be going' to camp.

got turned round- in the darkness. Perhaps
you'll jes' put us in the path ; and for your
trouble, you shall have a long pull at my can-
teen whenever you come to the quarters of the
Palmetto Guard."
"And I'll speak a good word for you to Col-
onel Lovelace," said Melrose.
" Thank'e, drummer !" responded Ben, grin-
ning the whole width of his mouth. " P'r'aps
I shall jes' mention ye to Lowenthal. Who,
knows but he'1 permote ye?  'Twouldn't be
queer if he E hould give ye a high sitywation !"
Milrose thought of the prison at the top of
the house. There was something horribly re-
pulsive and sinister about sthe wide-mouthed
man.
"He'd take mightily to a little cock-robin
like you--Lowenthal would. Do for a page.
Could hold his stirrup, or toddle arter him with
his sword. Great military people are fond o
pooty boys. Goddlemity !"
Milrose shivered. What did he mean?-
"The war'l1 be a short one," he we on,
with a low buckle. "We'll send out drum
and trumpet, and sound a parley. What arms
we've got in our army! And what legs, also !"
Ben's eyes rolled leisurely and exultingly over
Milrose.  He- was about to proceed with his
startling pleasantry, when the door of the hut
creaked on its wooden sockets, and Swampsey
stalked solemnly in. He had approached so
softly, that even the dogs had not heard him.
Some of the hounds, to vindicate their watch-
fulness and training, arose, snuffed round him,
and growled. But the little foundling of Alli-
gator Swamp was undismayed. While Milrose's
features expressed wonder, -Ben's swarthy face1
evinced decided dissatisfaction.
S What you here for?  Who sent ye, yer lit-
tle rat ?" he demanded.
Swampsey looked steadily around him, .and
took in quietly the whole scene. On Milrose
and Angeline his eyes finally settled.  He did
notdanswer Ben's questions, and that free-born
lord of the barrens grew impatient. The spu-
rious Ton and Disk were afraid to speak.to the
black pigmy, whose fixed gaze was every mo-
ient growing- embarrassing.
'Come 'long," said Swampsey, presently.
Come along where?" Angeline asked.
"Come 'long Swampsey.

" Do you know the way ?" she added.
"Know the way," drawled Swampsey, wink.
ing and blinking violently. "Come 'long
white folks I"
" He knows the way," said Milrose, eagerly
"and he will do just as well for a guide as an'
older person."
Swampsey bobbed his head perseveringly.
"Git out, you stunted mud-nigger!" roar-
ed Dykes, quite disturbed. " If you ain't out
o' this yer in a minute, I'll set the dogs onto
ye!"
Swampsey looked wishfully at Milrose, who,
arismng, said :
" Thank you, Dykes, for the shelter of your
hut. We won't trouble you farther. The boy,
I think, knows the way to camp. Don't let the
dogs hurt him"
, Ben jumped from his block and seemed per-
plexed and dubious. That he did not wish his
visitors to go, 'was evident. Milrose trembled
for the result.
"'Tisn't near mornin' yet," the man mutter-
ed, scowling wrathfully at Swampsey. " But
if ye choose to foller this yer imp in the tow
shirt, why, foller ; but if ye git lost, don't blame
me for't."
This acquiescence came in so surly a manner,
that Milrose's fears were rather increased than
allayed. She perceived in him an unwilling-
ness to lose sig ht of them.
Swampseyflung a somerset over three dogs,
and was out of the hut in a second. The girls
did not linger. It was yet dark, but the dark-
ness was welcome. Milrose went panting from
the thick,' choking atmosphere within, -to the
clear, reviving air without. Never had she ex-
perienced such relief. She heard Dykes quiet-
. encouta ing the negro-hounds to attack their
little friend; but for some singular reason, they
smelled around him without offering him harm.
Giving the frisky quadrupeds no notice, Swamp-
sey set his face in a particular direction, and
led off. 'As lie trudged along, he seemed to
Milrose like a small black speck in the path.
When they were some distance from the but,
Angeline asked:

"Know you're goin' along ; but where you

"Won't be lost," :nswered- Swampsey.
"What do you think you're doin', anyway?"
cried the girl, losing patience.
"doin' to'Mars'r Peter," said the boy.
"Who sent you ?" asked Milrose.
"Mars'r Peter."
"'Tell ye what !" protested Angeline. " This

casting aside all meekness, and sinking into his
natural swaggering style.-
" I do not want you!" answered Milrose,
curtly. " Go your way., If you interrupt us,
it will be at-your peril."
" What a incident it is!" retorted Ben. "It's
a event for a cent'ry, this yer is! I'll be dog-
goned if 'tisn't too rich for the stomach."
The wide mouth grew fearfully facetious.
" This way, my warriors ! This way, my ca-
nary-legged musicioners ! Know every foot of
the piney-woods-I do. No danger gittin' lost.
Be in a beautiful shanty, fast thing yoij-dunno.
Lead ye through this yer straight asan arrer
the darkest night."
" Choose your path, and begone !" replied
Milrose, with surprising steadiness. " We stir
not at your bidding."
" Come along, or I shall have to fetch ye !"
exclaimed Ben, advancing upon Milrose. She
shrank from him, and looked hopelessly for
Swam psey. The man seized her wrist, and
dragged her forward. The climax of misfortune
seemed to be reached. She struggled resolutely ;
but his hand was harder than the pine trees, and
held her remorselessly. , She thought her wrist-
bones were being crushed in his greedy grasp.
She knew her secret was out. She perceived
that no common-motive was moving Dykes' con-
duct. A powerful spell was on him, and there
was a frightful zeal in every action. He appear-
ed as one under the intoxication of hasheesh.
Here was the parallel of the dove and the
hawk. The one was fluttering, and exerting its
feeble strength in unavailing resistance ; the
other, fierce and pitiless, had fixed its talons, and
was bearing off its prey.
She entreated ; she threatened, and called for
help. The barrens echoed to her voice.
Angeline, in a position entirely new, her mind
muddled with superstitious fears, proved utterly
useless. She might, perhaps, have thrown her-
self upon Ben,- had not the two hounds, Jeff
and Beau, smelled around her as if their nos-
trils had caught the scent of Negro blood.
She had a wholesome dread of trained dogs.
She had seen runaways brought back, torn and
worried. - She could not forget the terror of those
unfortunates. She loved her mistress, and she
did make a fight with her fears.
As Dykes led on his victim, she followed, at
first moaning and muttering, and finally, find.
ing herself actually alive and uninjured, hurling
all manner of epithets at Ben, who, leaving the
beaten path, pushed into the woods as fast as he
could urge the unwilling feet of Milrose.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE   MESSENGER.
The moment Lowenthal left Peter Rust in such
a state of uncertainty, a messenger arrived on a
reeking horse, and pushing aside the guard that
opposed his entrance, strode hurriedly into the

mansion. Hearing quick, heayy steps in the
hall, Lowenthal went to meet the uneeremos-
ous visitor, in whom he recognized a Confeder-
ate officer.
"Colonel Lovelace ?" exclaimed Lowenthal.
"This is an unexpected pleasure. What brings
you?"
They shook hands.
"A horse, covered with foam, which requires
careful grooming," replied the officer, excited-
ly. "The Yankee fleet has appeared on our
coast. We 'are expecting an attack at Port.
Royal!"
" So near !" said Lowenthal, with a start.
" They have threatened us a long time ; but I
doubted whether their temerity would lead them
so far. They never can pass Hilton Head. We
have soil enough to bury them on if they effect
a landing, colonel !"
" We care not thus to enrich our soil !" an-
swered Lovelace, with a shrug.
"I wish Lincoln would send down asn army
of gentlemen. It's too bad to put us to killing
cobblers, tinkers, and tailors !" said Lowenthal.
" You are a great deal spattered and blown,
a.lonel. I hope there's no panic down there."
"Panics are for Manassas. We leave those
for the ' On to Richmond' people !"
Lovelace laughed.
"I was just sitting down to breakfast. A cup
of coffee, I am sure, will be acceptable to you.
This way."
Colonel Lovelace threw off his military over-
coat and cap, and in a moment had his military
legs under Lowenthal's table. The planter
touched a bell, and a colored girl came in to
serve.
Lovelace looked at Lowenthal inquiringly.
"Babel is away," said the latter, answering
the glance, "but you need not fear to speak
freely. My slaves never leave th  plantation."
" That black Goliah was might co enient,"
replied the colonel, " because he ould betray
no secrets. Pity the whole race wasn't deaf and
dumb ! But we couldn't make soldiers of them
inthat case."
"You have not come for nothing. May I ask
your business, colonel ?"
" Hurry up the men ! Everything and every-
body must be pressed into the service as rapid-
ly as possible. We must arm the slaves. Your
niggers '1l fight, won't they ?"
" I don't know," answered Lowenthal, reflect.
ively. A "Our traditions say they'll fight for
their masters. We have many pretty legends
about the devotion of our chattels. I should
think they'd, fight to perpetuate their bond-
age !"
Lowenthal looked at Lovelace very meaning-
ly.
"A slave chain and an overseer's whip ought
to be the device on their banner."
. Lovelace smiled over this pleasant conceit.

"Thee loves the whip, friend Roscoe ;' and,,
truly, there is a sweet music in it, as it goes
humming through the air. He that spareth the
rod spoileth the child. These black Saxons are
our children, and we do not well if we beat
them not soundly."
Broadbent sighed, and turned his eyes up-
ward. He had a long face just then.
"This is edifying !" sneered Lovelace.
"In referring to the whip; friend Roseoe, thou
unwittingly touched an interesting article of my
faith. I believe in scourgings oft. The whip is
the great expounder of knotty questions. It is
a mighty reasoner. It overcometh the flesh
and the devil. It is sharper than a two-edged
sword it, layeth bare the back, and divideth the
skin and the muscles."
Broadbent stopped, and made a longer face
than before.
" A false mercy," he went on, "often doeth
mischief. Too much tenderness is a devilsto
be cast out. The negro is subordinate unto
man."
" Subordinate unto man !" repeated Lovelace,
with a queer look.
" Being thrown upon our protection," resum-
ed Martin, with growing fervor, "like his breth-
ren of the field, the horse and the ox, it becomes
our duty to teach him obedience.  The resem-
blance of the negro to man should not mislead
us.' ,
" By no means !" observed Lovelace, highly
entertained by Martin's singular views.
" To subject the black to the arts of industry,
and make him useful to the human race, is in-
deed a benevolent object. Let the whip swing ;
let it hum and whistle from morning till might;
let it cut and scarify, flay and blister, mince and
macerate, till the brute instincts of the man-
animal be subdued, conquered, and extinguished!
They are unworthy masters and mistresses who
are startled at the sight of blood. I tell thee,
friend Roscoe, that the whip is the schoolmaster
of the negro ; it is his book, his education, his
monitor, his conscience, and his savior."
The voice of Martin was steady, -cold, and
calm. There was no pity and mercy in it.
Lowenthal stared at hium in strange perplexity.
Be thought he could fathom men ; but here
was one whose depths he was not sure he could
sound. He did not know what to say, or how
to deal with him.
" This person is getting horrible !" said Love-
lace, moving his- chair. "He has the cold-
blooded cruelty of the North, without thIe i-
pulsiveness of the South. He should whip no
nigger of mine !"
"The- horse and the harness,- the ox and the
yoke, must be well acquainted," said Martin.
" The beast that is best broken does the most
work, and takes to it most kindly. The relation
of man and negro is not one o' mutual agree-
ment. It is the relation of Force. I know my

business. I subdue the black animal, or the
black animal subdues me. I see the stern al-
ternative. You must trample ambition out of
him. Therefore, I say flagellate, flog, cut,
slash, and, if necessary, shoot, hang, and burn !"
Broadbent's eyes, which had been fixed in
thoughtful contemplation on the ceiling, rolled
calmly down upon Lowenthal, who was studying
him with all his powers of concentration.
" He's just my- man," muttered the planter,
"or he's not my man at all."
" Impassive devil !" said Lovelace.
"I give you carte blanche," said the planter,
by and by. " Whip and pickle to your heart's
content. If you hear any mutinous talk, shoot,
and welcome. And it would be well to creep
among the quarters at night to see whits going
on. There are alarming whispers on the wind.
Servile insurrections are feared.  We don't
want our throats cut by our slaves. The Yan-
kee fleet is off Port Royal, the colonel informs
me, and there's likely to be fighting. Allow
not a hand to leave the plantation. Don't let
them be loitering about, and have them in their
huts at dark. ny-the-by, how is that runaway
girl that Dykes brought in the day before yes-
terday ? You didn't quite finish her, I suppose ?"
" She is an example to all that behold her.
The dogs, perhaps, took hold somewhat sharper
than was needful, and in my wrath I was rather
too free with the rod, considering that she was
weak from fasting and weariness ; tnt she can
lie on her face with tolerable case, and if fever
does not set in, she will be well in a few weeks.
I am not a hard man, friend Roscoe."
" A very lamb !" muttered Lovelace.
"One word more," added Martin. "I would
have the man Benjamin, whose surname is
Dykes, use more discretion in the taking of run-
aways. . It is not well to have them returned
bitten, and so faint from loss of blood that
the whip cannot be profitably employed.. I
know my business."
" I think you may be trusted," answered
Lowenthal, deliberately. le then arose and
walked with Martin to the door. " If you prove
what you seem, you have a friend in me. If
you play the hypocrite, the devil may be soon-
or-deceived than I. I may have work for you-
confidential work. That Peter Rust has not
not turned out well. He's a mule!"
Broadbent nodded, as if he understood.
" Nothing goes on up there as I expected,"
added the planter, with a lowering of the voice,
and an upward motion. "If I call on you for
aid, there will be a secret to keep. A short
time will determine. Go, and look well to your
business.
"Fear not for me," responded Martin, with
that puzzling equanimity and steadiness that,
at times, were so baffling to the planter. "In
truth, I will be prudent, discreet, circumspect,
and, as I may say, wary."

a little black boy, in a tow-shirt, followed him.
"Thank Heaven I" muttered Martin.  4' A
burden'is lifted from my conscience."
Passing to the rear of the house, he crossed
the garden and entered by a private .door.
Without knowing it;,he .passed Milrose and An-
geline in the dark, narrow hall. He went di-
rectly to the top of the dwelling, where Babel
was keeping his silent vigil. lie found him
asleep. .Laying his hand on his shoulder, he
said :.             L
"c Awake, Babel !"       '
The black clutched his.blunderbuss, and leap-

-'Come, BabelI"..
The giant rubbed his-eyes,
"'Shake off thy stupor," resumed Martin. "I
have need of thee."     ,.
Babel looked at him hnquir'ingly.,. ...
" Thou mayst -have tongue ani ears," added
the overseer. C Lowenthal rode away in haste

" What do you want, rny master " asked Ba-

"Leave your gun.ant follow me."
" To death,my master I"   ,       .
Placing his blunderbuss against the wall, he
went with Martin submissively. No'nmore was
said till they reached the: hut where Ela and
the body were..
"MJast kept thy courage ?"
"il have kept the sh;lows behind me," re-
plied Ela.  f' Think of yourself.  Here-is a

 "A ngral e" exclaimed Ela. "The deaf

'Master," said Babel, " since I may talk, it
shall-be to the point.; I think'I can take care of
this. But I must wash off the black."
" Do as thou wilt.,I, can trust thee," Martin
replied, watching the negro's countenanee close-
ly. "Peter Rust has escaped. I did not te.1
thee, but hie is free."
"' hst .is good   i thought he would get
away, and ,it; better for my, plan."
The black went for water, and returning vitlh

body, and started off with it. Martin. follow-

"Master, you said you would trust me," an
swered the black, pausing just beneath the-win-
dow from which Peter Rust haa escaped.
.  " es; I remember," returned Martin, reflce-
t-ively. " I-will not call my words."
Just then his hand touched the rope that still
angled; from the window.
" Ah I, what is this?" he s mid. "It is the
rope by which Peter descended."
"Give me the end of it, master," said Babel.
Martin handed him the end of the rope, and
making a noose in it, Babel slipped it under the
armas of the dead man.
"Come, master. My work is above, now."
Babelburried through the private door and
the winding staircase to the-place where iebhad
kept watch, Martin at his heels. He lighted a
lamp that hung in the passage, and.drawing the
ousteribolt of the door, threw "himself against it
with sueh force that the inside fastenings gave
way. What could withstand those broad shop.l
des, when the will went with them?

Martin followed his movements with wonder
and curiosty. The giant,darted to the window,
seized the rope, and drew up the body. It fell
into the room like a clod, as it was. Babel un-
fastened the rope from the joist, coiled it up, and
gave it to Martin, saying :
" When you go out, master, put it out of
sight."
After this, he shut the window, and dragging
the body, proceeded to place it a little upon one
side, with one arm partly under the head, where,

as if a ball through that door had killed him.
You see, he was shot through the head, and
died without a struggle. Master, have I done
weil?"
" Thou hast done well!"'!
Leaving the prison, Babel closed the door,
pushed the bolt, and resumed his blunderbuss.
While Martin was going back to the hut, he
heard Lowenthal returning.
CHAPTER XVII.
IN JUDGMENT.
Lowenthal came home excited, and in on ex-
ultant mood. He drank deeply, ate nothing,
went to bed, slept heavily, and awoke in the
morning with a headache, and in a detestable
temper. Having breakfasted with Colonel Love-
lace, he had a prisoner brought in for examin-
tion. Though holding no regular commission
from the psuedo Confederate Government, he
exerted an authority that was sometimes both
lawless and summary. The man who controls a
few'hundred negroes and a plantation which you.
cannot see across with a glass, is, in all essentials,
an autocrat and a despot.
The person brought in to be interrogated and
adjudged, was a young man of twenty-six or
seven, of good figure and firm bearing. His
complexion was clear, his face exhibiting none
of those marks of dissipation that characterize
men of free ideas and convivial habits. Al-
though pale, he had by no means a sickly or
effeminate look. He had calm eyes, and a
quick, vigorous intellect.
He appeared in the presence of Lowenthal
and Lovelace, guarded by three tall, stoop-
shouldered fellows in gray clothes. Lowenthal
put a glass to his eye, and looked him over
superciliously. He was about to make an in-
sulting remark, when a servant announced that,
there was a gentleman at the door who desired
to see him immediately.
"1Let him wait !" said Lowenthal.
The servant replied that the person would not
be refused.

"We will see," said the planter, frowning.
"Begone !"
The slave was backing tremblingly from the
room, when he was unceremoniously thrust
aside by the person seeking audience. He en-
tered, followed by a stout negro. He was a
man of middle age, with black eyebrows, gray
hair, and long gray beard. He : wore green
spectacles, which concealed the color and ex-
pression of the eyes. Had it not been for the
silvery beard, one might have said tuat there
was a young face on an old head.
This not-to-be-denied visitor was of slight-
figure, yet strikingly compact and shapely.
His motions were remarkably quick and springy
for one of his age. Resolution and decision
marked every look and gesture.
The negro who attended him was taller than
Babel, straight as a flag-staff, and in symmetry
a bronze Hyperion. The African lips, the flat-
tened nose, the low forehead, the crispy hair,
were entirely wanting ; there being substituted
for them, comely lips, a straight nose, a broad
brow, and dark hair. His skiff was of a soft
yellow, by no means displeasing. There was a
certain air of repose in his features, that indi-
cated self-reliance and power. He was plainly
yet respectably dressed. He kept very near his
master.
Lowenthal was annoyed at this intrusion, and
whatever feeling counseled forbearance, it was
not good will.
" Markthaler, I think your business would
have kept," were his first words of greeting,
spoken ungraciously.
"Business !" replied the other. "That is a
word I like to hear. Come ; let us attend to it
at once."
" I am  busy. Matters of state at present
occupy my attention. When the safety of the
Confederacy is concerned, I have no time of my
own," answered Lowenthal, leveling his glass
again at the prisoner. " You will oblige me,"
he added, " by retiring a few moments, while I
question this suspicious person."
"Pardon me, sir," said Markthaler, familiar-
ly. " What is your business is also mine. Our
interests are somewhat the same, I think. If
the South goes to the devil, I suppose you and
L individually and respectively, will go with it.
So I will just sit down here and look over my
papers, while you look over your - man there,
with his hands tied. Jacob, stand behind me."
Markthaler dropped himself carelessly into
the~ easiest chair in the room, and the yellow
Apollo placed himself behind him.
Lowenthal gnawed his lips with vexation.
.Lovelace looked from one to the other in su-
preme surprise. He was not accustomed to
hear Lowenthal addressed so cavalierly. He
whispered :
"Throw him out of the window!"
"Unfortunately," muttered the planter surli-

ly, lie's the only man in the world that I can't
throw out of the window."
" What is he ?" Leoelace asked, in the same
tone.
neA money-devil! A d-d blood-sucker !"
answered Lo'wentha1, setting'his teeth together.
"Can you not get along without blood-suck-
ers ?" Lovelace inquired, still more surprised.
" Your fortune is princely. You can buy all
all the usurers in the- country,".he added.
" It's an extroardinary crisis," answered the
planter, flushing, "ud-and,-in short, I need
money. Loans are sometimes wonderfuly con-
venient."
Lovelace scanned the planter's face for a mo-
ment, and said no more.-
"Pray don't heed me," said Markthaler, pull-
ing some papers from his coat-pocket. " While
you are sending your suspicious fellow to be
shot or hanged, I shall afhuse myself very well
with these columns of figures.. hope you feel
quite well, my dear Lowenthal. You have those
heats. and chills yet, I observe. You should
take quinine. -Quinine is the stuff for these in-
terinittents.''
The planter clutched the arms of his chair
with his white hands, and tried to look tran-
quil
"I have no need of money-devils," said Love-
lace, leaning toward the planter.. " I can throw
him out of the window as well as not."
The colonel started toward Markthaler, as if
he meant to put his threat in execution.
The first obstacle he met, were the eyes 'of
Jacob, which beamed on him like infernal fur-
naces; the second was' the voice of Lowenthal
calling him back.
" Colonel Lovelace, I think ?" said the ,money-
changer, nodding slightly. "Happy to meet
ou, sir. You'll look out for the Yankee fleet,
I'll warrant.A
Lovelace returned to his seat, unaccountably
put down and baffled. He was dissatisfied with
Lowenthal and with himself.
" Heed not the usurer, colonel. Money-lend-
ers, like death, cannot be done away with. Peo-
ple must die and be buried, you know, which is
a great nuisance," said the planter, in a hurried
under-tone. Then to the prisoner : " Young
man, look at me. I want your attention."
The prisoner turned upon Lowenthal eyes so
clear and steady that he was confused, and be-
trayed more guilt than the accused.
"What is your name ?" he demanded.
" Frederick North. Had it been unknown to
you, you could have asked it with better grace,"
replied the young man
" Confine your remarks to the questions," re
turned the planter, haughtily. "As for know-
ing people, my knowledge is usually limited to
gentlemen."
" Of what am I accused ?" asked North.
" Of everything but loyalty to the Confeder

acy," retorted Lowenthal. "There are but two
classes of people among us, friends and foes."
" You are accused of being a Unionist," said
Lovelace.
" A dreadful crime I" said a voice, that seem-
ed to come from Markthaler's direction.
Castingan angry glance that way, Lowenthal
saw him busy with his papers.
" Are you both accuser and judge ?" Freder-
ick demanded.
"I can produce witnesses, if necessary ; but
it is my pleasure to question you in the Presence
of Colonel Lovelace. These are not times to
be over nice. In South Carolina we have a re-
markably short way of dealing with traitors. It
is. well-understood that your language, on sever-
al occasions, has been treasonable ; and, in fact,
that you are in correspondence with the enemy.
I might have had you shot down yesterday
when you resisted my men ; but I preferred to,
condemn or acquit you out of your own mouth.
Were you not lurking about my house, at a late
hour, night before last?"
"Frederick North's cheeks flushed, and he
replied, after a moment of confusion:,
" I decline to answer'that question."
" You hear, colonel?- He refuses to answer,"
observed Lowenthal. "Do you, or do you not,
believe in the Confederacy ?" he added.
" To what Confederacy do you refer ?" asked
North,
" To the Confederate States of America !" re-
plied the planter, pompously.
"I have heard of such. a concern," said
Frederick, coolly ; " but I know of no such gov-
ernment on earth."
" Insolent !" exclaimed Lovelace.
" 'Ie ignores the government he lives under !"
resumed Lowenthal, with affected astonishment.
" Perhaps, young man," he went on, with in-
creasing severity of manner, "you will next
speak ill of the President, Vice-President, and
of the Southern Congress ?"    .     ,
" He cannot rise to such a sublimity of infamy
as that !" interrupted Markthaler,-with singular
sang froid.
" Will you mind your business, sir?" cried
Lowenthal, quite thrown from his moral equi-
librium.
"I have never troubled the President or Vice-
President," replied Frederick, quietly.  "As
for the other thing you mentioned-the South-
ern Congress-I have never metit anywhere in
my travels. All I wish is liberty and my natur-
al rights.  You have seized me like a felon,
and dragged me here with violence and insult ;
and if the time ver comes when I can meet
you face to face, oh equal terms, as man should
meet his fellow-man, I will reward your friendly
offices as they deserve. At present you have
the advantage. You are surrounded by your
tools and ruffians, and it-only remains for me to
- bear your injustice and brutality as I may."

like 'tother thing did."
Hillhouse chanced to look at the planter, and
was confounded to see him pale with rage.,
" Your witness," said North, sarcastically,
" is like two-edged sword ; he cuts both ways."
"You arc drunk, sir!I" cried Lowenthal, se-
verely.
The witness glanced wonderingly from one to
another.
"Proceed, sir," said Lovelace, who was in a
cold perspiration.
."'Twar right down love-makin'," said the
witness, desperately. " Never hearn sich, nev-

rake out a new thought. " Ye -see, Iwar -set-
tin' under a pine-tree, and the darkness it war so
thick-"
"That will do, sir ." interposed Lowenthal.
Then, to Lovelace: "I hope you are satisfied, ,
colonel ?
"I am satisfied that your step-daughter has a
lover, sir !" answered Lovelace, with an ill grace.,

"It is quite immaterial what you see, or whatE

"There is too much draught on this man,
Lowenthal.   Turn his damper," interrupted
Markthaler, with a smile and a shrug. Then to
Lovelace : ." Which will you punish, colonel;
the love or the treason ?"
The Confederate officer gnawed his lips and
reddened with anger.
"I have soldiers within call," he retorted-
" and if you should find your way to the guard-
house, or the whipping-post, do not be surpris-
ed."
The tall, symmetrical figure of Jacob loomed
higher and higher behind his master's chair.
His nostrils expanded, his eyes shot rays of de-
fiance.
Markthaler sat cool and unmoved, toying with
a slip of paper.
" You represent," he answered, calmly, "tth.
soldier-power, while I represent the cash-power.
Cash is ;greater than cotton. Cotton is -local,
cash universal. With cash in hand, we marry
the prettiest girls, and live in the finest houses."
This remark, though quietly -uttered, touched
the officer in the most sensitive spot. He wish-
ed to marry Milrose, but he had no cotton. He
wished to marry Milrose, but he had no negroes.
He wished to marry Milrose, but he had no
cash. The colonel's chattels had been knocked
down by the auctioneer before the siege of
Sumter; and his cotton, unfortunately, had
perished between the seed and the pod. Had
it not been for this, there is no knowing how
much he might have been worth. As it was,
he sat there with commission from Jeff Davis
in his pocket, a large capital of family pride in
his head, a good deal of rebellion in his heart,
a major-generalship in the distance, and a splen-
did sword with which to slay the enemies of the
South Carolina Nation.
=The colonel, though young, brave, and good-
looking, had a heart-disease, and that heart-dis-'
ease was Milrose Dorn; and that young lady
unconsciously kept him in a painful palpitation
of hope and, fear. He had tried to get cured of
Milrose, but after several efforts,,yielded to the
malady, which had made fearful inroads on his
peace of mind.'
The singular testimony of Hillhouse revealed
to him a secret of which lie had been profound-
y ignorant. It astounded him more than a
burst of artillery. A feeling of disappointment,
mpossible to describe, swept over him ; then
came chagrin, and a desire to 'be avenged on
some one, and whom so proper a subject of ven.

MILROSE ; OR, TIIE COT ION-PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.

The colonel's regiment was called the Beau-
fort Guards ;_ and their camp, which was about
a hundred rods from Lowentlal's, had been
named Carmp Royal. To Camp Royal Lovelace
directed his steps. The regiment was drilling
by companies. Notwithstanding the pre-occu-
pation of his mind, lie paused and looked at
them. Comparisons are natural ; they flow out
of one's understanding without effort. The
Confederate officer was the subject of these
mental calculations. His eyes searched in ivain
for large numbers of those chivalrous gentle-
men said to have shouldered arms in the de-
fence of Southern liberties. Instead of knights-
errant in gallant array, lie beheld a motley mass
of poor and ignorant men, ill-clad and rough.
In the midst of this undisciplined crew, he saw
Frederick North, with a gun on shoulder. To
his surprise, this new conscript appeared not
the least embarrassed or put down. He went
through the manual drill with notable proupti-
tude and precision. His handsome counte-
nance, straight and graceful figure, contrasted
strangely with those about him. He made no
mistakes, and evidently understood the exercis-
es better than the drill-officer.
Their eyes met. Lovelace blushed ; North
smiled and touched his cap. The former felt
no triumph in his advantage. The young man
made him think of Bunker Hill and the old
flag. He sighed and turned away. Milrbse and
the rebellion were still in his heart ; but Milrosc
first. His hopes had that morning received a
fatal wound. He was amazed at the depth and
fervency of his love for Mllrose, which the
events of the last hour had revealed to him.
He wondered at his own wretchedness. He dis-
trusted Lowenthal. He resolved to see Hill-
house privately, and question hini closely. -'
While thinking of these things, Martin Broad-
bent approached him. This man's deportment
always drew attention. Wherever he went, peo-
ple paused to look at him. This was because
le differed from others. He was one of those
persons that can be felt when they are near.
Lovelace bowed recognition from force of
habit.   'Â°
"Truly, friend Lovelace, this is a goodly ar-
ray of the chief captains and the mighty men
of war," he remarked.
"Hunph!" said the colonel, with a slight
jerk of the body.      -
" These be the men," continued Martin, so-
norously. " who take their lives in their hands,
and go forth, without purse or scrip, to fight for
their substance and their chattels."
"They have scrip enough, God knows !" re-
torted Lovelace, impatiently.
" Thou art captious, friend, and speakest af-
ter the manner of the children of this world. I
fear thou feelest no enthusiasm at a spectacle
'like this."
Martin stopped, then went on.

"I  pray thee note their warlike bearing.
Behold how brightly their bayonets gleam in
the sun!"
" It happens, unfortunately," said Lovelace,
dryly, " that but few of them have bayonets.
If a few hundreds of rusty shot-guns gleam,
why, then, they gleam."
4 Thou carpest again,' resumed Broadbent.
" But if thou wilt fault their guns and equip-
ments, I will call thy attention to the alacrity
of their movements, the perfection of their drill,
and the military ardor that inflnes their
faces."
" You are either a wag, or a great fanati ,
Mr. Overseer. I like wholesome praise ; but I
have a horror of exaggeration. I can see
neither alacrity of movement nor perfection
of drill ; and, to speak plainly, their faces are
oftener inflamed with whisky than with milita-
ry ardor. I should like to find all those manly
and soldierly qualities you talk of; but I shall
have to look further, I'm afraid. The fact is,
these are the dregs of our social system. Few
of them are in good condition. Most of then-
have been cheated of fair proportions. Low
and thriftless habits do not develop 'nianliood.
Yonder is a fellow all legs and arms. He is
lank and ungainly, lantern-jawed and stoop-
shouldered. If you glance around, you will
find many like him. It comes of being at the
wrong end of the ladder. Now that is not the
ngterial for an army."
"But, friend Lovelace, the cause will inspire
these people. Reflect that all they possess i
the world is staked in this contest."
" Bali! All they possess in the world wouk
not suffice to buy them a pair of brogans eacle  ,
said the officer, annoyed by the persistency of
Martin.
" Thee must remember that slavery is at
stake, and that it is necessary to, the cotton in-
terest that the negro race should be subject to
man."
Broaibent looked gravely and calmly at the
Confederate officer, who answered, dubiously.
" You are a singular person. I wish you
would go away."
" Truly, friend, I caiinot depart, for here
hath Providence east me to labor faithfully for
the subjugation of the black Saxon. Yea, it is
my duty to strike, whip, castigate, flagellate,
and subdue such as are intrusted to ny care.
Verily, I will cry aloud and spare not; and
reason with them powerfully, even to the cruai-
fying of the flesh. I am not a hard man, and I
know my business."
" I am a Southern man, and a rebel' of the
darkest water, but I loathe barbarity. 1 confess
I am somewhat .Afraid of you, Mr. Overseer..
You know too much or too little, and I have not
wit enough to tell 'which. In either case you
may be dangerous. My head is not so large as
yours, Mr. Broadbent; therefore, we had better

keep apart. I go in for fighting, but not for
mincing up negroesI"
Lovelace folded his arms, and partly turned
Ids back on the Quaker.
"Thou knowest the maiden called Milrose ?"
said Martin, abruptly.
Lovelace-was now ready to bear. Martin had
touched the right string. [ie turned hastily.
" -know Miss Dorn," he said.
"I was of that opinion," continued Martin.
" What did you wish to say of her?" asked
the colonel, somewhat coldly.
" Not much, friend Lovelace. She was not
quite happy, I thought, when I saw her last.
Perhaps the rebellion troubles her, or her prop-
erty needs looking after.  Young girls, it is
said, find ways to make themselves miserable.
And, of a truth, there are gossiping people who
tell strange stories ; or, rather, I should say,
vague whispers drift in the air, and reach the
ears of some, who, verily, may be prying per-
sons given to minding the affairs of their neigh-
bors," answered Martin, fixing his eyes incident-
ally, apparently, on Frederick North.
" Your meaning is dark, friend Broadbent,"
said the colonel, whose interest was now thor-
oughly awakened. " Which way do your sus-
pieions point, or what am I to infer from your
words? Come, sir ; yius can trust me."
"Of a verity, there is a young man in the
ranks witlji whose figure and bearing thou canst
find no fault. I do not remember to have seen
him in the ranks before," observed Martin.
" But, as I was saying to thee, the maiden up
yonder "-he pointed to the house-" may have
more cause for fear and unhappiness than thou
thickest. Thou art a man of honor, according
to thy prejudices and beliefs ; and I may safely
say to thee that the house of Lowenthal has its
mysteries."l
Lovelace leaned eagerly toward Martin.
Every word he uttered was full of startling in-
terest.
" Do you not know," he said, " that Milrose
has disappeared ?"
" Heaven give her safety I" exclaimed Mar-
tin.                               ,
" That implies," remarked Lovelace, thought-
fully, "that she has not been safe."
" the construction was thine," responded
Martin. " Where has the damsel gone ?"
" Those who run away, seldom leave word
where they are going. Tell me, sir-has Low-
enthal,-"
"Of Lowenthal I say nothing," interrupted
Martin. " Thou hast eyes, and ears, and sense :
use them. Why should I take away another
man's understanding? Nevertheless, were I an
honorable man, desirous of doing good, I would
lay aside all rivalry and jealousy, and, rising
above partisan hate and private vengeance, seek
to befriend a demsel forlorn, who ,hath fallen
into the fowler's snare."

Martin Broadbent spoke earnestly and more
rapidly than usual. Lovelace thought of the
testimony of Hillhouse, and his vague conjec-
tures began to take form.
"Thou knowest thy business, colonel, and I
know mine. Thou art a chief captain over men,
and I the humble ruler over negroes. Thou
art a discipliner of heroes"-Martin's long,
white fingers made a thrust toward the Beaufort
Guard-" and I the subjugator of chattels. For
King Cotton thou swingest the sword ; for King
Cotton I swing the whip. We serve the same
mighty Moloch. Great is Dia'na of the Ephe-
sians !"
The two men faced each other., The axes of
their eyes met. Martin was firm and steady.
The officer 'was held in silence and doubt. He
recoiled, putting forth his hands, as if to push
Martin back. Martin raised his arms, till they
seemed to tremble over all the cotton in the
South, and said, in a suppressed voice :
" Cotton, all hail ! Thou art indeed a king,
clothed in purple and finelinen. Thou goest
forth conquering and to conquer. Thou leadest
men captive. Thy chariot-wheels crush old
and young, and the blood flows even to the
bridle-rein ! Hail, all hail!" 
Lovelace gasped, like a drowning man. He
brushed his hand across his brow, and seemed
terrified. His gaze wandered over the broad
cotton-fields. A vision of fire and blood swam
before his sight.
" What are we," resumed Martin, solemnly,
" that we should fear to die for the king? Let
us cast ourselves under his groaning chariot-
wheels. Let us perish with our wives and sweet.
hearts ; with our mothers, fathers, and broth-
ers. Men die but once. How glorious to fall
for the purple monarch ! Like the Moslem
leader, we may proclaim, "Paradise to those
that fall !"
Lovelace did not speak; lie could not. He
was overborne by Martin. He saw armies, and
bayonets, and banners, artillery and bursting
shells, red shields and trampled fields.
"There will be a sound of mourning in the
land," continued Martin, in a tremulous tone.
" Mothers weeping for their first-born, and wives
wailing wildly over slaughtered husbands. But
what of this? Cotton is king, and England and
France, and all the nations of the earth, kneel
at his bloody shrine. Go on ! go on ! Count
not the cost. God will smile at the earnage,
and applauding angels clap their hands. Bid
the birds of the air to the feast ! Long live the
sovereign that has but one institution, and one
rallying-cry to battle !"
He paused a moment.
" Thou to thy work-I to mine. Shake out
the stars and bars! Down with the Union and
the Constitution !"
Lovelnee turned away from Martin in wonder
mnd dismay. Never had sach pictures been-

'1

painted on his imagination. When he looked
np to make an angry retort, the place where
Martin had stood was vacant.      .  .
CHAPTER XXL
PETER RST.
We left Milrose in a situation painful and
embarrassing, from  which every fminine in-
itinet of her nature shrank with terror and
loathing. She saw no means of escape., She
resisted at every step ; but, opposed to his
rough strength, her feeble hands wer9 unavail-
ing. Perceiving that she was wasting her pow-
ers fruitlessly, she made a resolute endeavor to
regain that self-possession so needful in moments
of danger.
Having a vigorous intellect, a commanding
will, and a quick wit, she would, no doubt, have
succeeded in overcoming her excessive fright,
and subduing that weakness that injured instead
of aiding her, when the timely appearance of
Peter lust put an entirely new aspect upon the
whole matter. Peter of the Pines came sud-
denly from among the. trees, and advancing si-
lently and swiftly upon Ben Dykes, tripped. up
his heels and laid him upon the ground. The
two dogs made a feeble assault upon Peter's
legs, but a few well-directed kicks sent them
yelping away.
Dykes remained where he had fallen, quite
breathless and amazed, with his feet entangled
in a cluster of laurel.
" Look out there, -youngster I" said Peter,
warningly, to Milrose. " Don't step into his
mouth ! Better get your foot into a bear-trap,
than into them there jaws."
Milrose ,was unable to speak ; she was in a
flutter of joyful emotion.
"Don't be afeard," said Peter. "The dan-
ger's all over. This critter, you see, isn't in a
condition to hurt ye."
While Peter was speaking, he gave Ben some
sharp strokes with his foot, and added, after-
ward :
" Get up, you dog-trainer of the ,turpentine'
woods, and take yourself off in double-quick'!
We'll have a settlement of our accounts one o'
these days, I guess."
Dykes extridated his feet, arose, and flew at
Peter, who parried his wrathful blows and trip-
ped up his heels again.
Just then Milrose discovered Swampsey, a
little beyond Peter, cutting capers with wonder-
ful rapidity.
As for Angeline, her courage came back in a
nost remarkable manner.
"1 Laws, Miss Lilly !" she exclaimed, forget-
ting her role. "Tole ye 'twa'n't nothin'. What's
the use being' scared at a low white trash like
Turpentine Ben ?" .
Milrose gave her maid an admonitory shake,
to bring her back to prudence.

3eu Dykes got up and sneaked away, mutter-
ing threats and curses.
Day was now dawning. Faint rays of light
fell on the pale face of Milrose. Peter of the
Pines contemplated her with manifest embar-
rassment.
- " You need not ,tremble," he paid, encourag-
ingly. " I know enough of you to understand
how you should be, treated. Don't look down
and blush. I like spirit and bravery. Folks is
sometimes forced to do what they'd rather not.
But the best way is, to draw a cheerful face and
make the best ont. I remember ye well. How
could I forget that face? I couldn't - never,
never ! It come to me up there"-he pointed
toward the plantation-" like an angel's. I own
I never 'saw nothin' like.it, and for a moment or
so, I allowed you was supernat'ral."
" Love o' God !" cried .Angeline. "'Pears
like cur secret is cl'ar gone !"
" Never mind your secret," replied Peter,
"butcome with me. What I can do for you,
I'll do with hearty good-will, and with no more
cur'osity than is nat'ral to human natur'."
" I thank you for your kindness," said Mil-
rose, recovering her confused faculties. " I am
sure you are very considerate. But do not mis-
take my feelings: I do not regret the step I
have taken, nor do I blush at these garments.
I am young, but not a child, sir. I have no in-
clination to-play the fainting heroine. My story
is brief. I was in danger under the roof where
I should have been entirely safe. I determined
not to remain there longer. I made my escape;
therefore, by a combination of circumstances
not foreseen, I am here, and in this attire.
Abashed I may be ; disappointed I certainly
am ; but return I will not ! Do you understand
me, Peter Rust ?"
Milrose spoke in a firm yet sweet tone of
voice, and her consistency and courage had a
favorable effect on Peter.
" I was born and brought up, miss, in a coun-
try where women are middlin well understood ;
in a country where the people are some'at gives
to the extreme of right, but a good country,
nevertheless."
Peter, who had all the while held his double-
gun in his hand, laid it carefully in the bend of
his left arm, studiously keeping its muzzle
pointed from Milrose.
"I can .say, miss, that I think I know your
meaning," he added. " Don't let your little
heart have a quiver of fear or a throb of mis-
givin'. I like your spirit;. and from the knowl-
edge I have of -Lowenthal, I edge you haven't
escaped an hour too soon. You saw me there
at work ; and who that prison was for, you ought
to know as well as I."
" My own convictions terrify me !" answered
Milrose.
" Lordy ! How that little nigger does swivel
round !" exclaimed Angeline, who could not l;eep

CHAPTER XXII.
THE PLANTER AND THE OVERSEER.
The scene with Ela, in the slave-hut, made a
deep impression on Martin Broadbent's mind.
Like a faithful guardianir, lie kept watch near the
hut till morning. His anger was equal to his
vigilance. It was a steady and unquenchable
flame that burned within him. There were
many dangers to be averted from her head. To
save her from the malice and baseness of Low-
enthal, was his fixed purpose. He feared that
he might visit her secretly, and discover the de-
ception that had been practiced ; in which event,
it was difficult to foresee what might happen.
Martin was a man of resolution. His courage
was of a calm and elevated .kind. In a just
cause, he was full of noble daring. In the
presence of Ela, he had thrown off the repul-
sive character which he had assumed. He had
stood before her as he really was-a :revelation,
most surprising and agreeable. Her feelings it
is not possible to describe ; they were of a
mingled and tumultuous nature. There was first
a dizzy whirl of wonder ; afterward, a staggering
incredulity ; then, an electric glow of convic-
tion; and finally, a full and joyful conscious-
ness of protection.  In her. esteem, Martin
Broadbent grew to fair and heroic proportions.
Be came to her, as an angel in a place where
there was no light. His quiet face was continu-
ally in her sight, strengthening her through the
long nights.
When, after some hours of restlessness, she
fell asleep, she dreamed of Martin, and beheld
him towering like a giant between herself and
Lowenthal. While her mind thus instinctively
clung to her preserver, he was keeping silent
vigil over the but that sheltered'her.
In the morning, when other duties called him
away, he placed a trusty negro in charge.
After his interview with -Colonel Lovelace, he
was slowly returning to the negro-quarters, when
he met his employer. Lowenthal was excited.
The full'effects of the disappearance of Milrose
were upois him. He was amazed and alarmed.
With these two emotions, there were alternations
of anger. This meeting with Martin seemed to
him opportune. He wanted somebody to venti-
late his wrath upon.I
"This plantation, sir, is rather loosely con-
ducted, sir! My daughter has run away, sir !"
he exclaimed, in a loud and fault-finding voice.
" I am not thy daughter's keeper, friend Low-
enthal," answered Martin, wildly. My duties
are limited to the negro race. It is not mine to
control men and women but to govern chattels !"
" But you should have your eyes about you,
sir !" retorted the planter. "You ought to see
what is going on around you, Mr. Broadbent."
" I tell thee, friend Planter, I have nothing to
do with thy daughter. The services that I give
thee for a stipulated sum, touch not thy house-
hold. If thou thinkest I would undertake to

control a woman, young or old, tlhou art greatly
mistaken. I know the sex are rebellious ; and
the younger and comelier, the more rebellious.
Heaven defend me from the care of damsels !
I can use the schoolmaster-which is the whip
-with some small skill and success. I can flag-
ellete, castigate, macerate, score, and under-
score, with acceptation and profit; but when it
comes to the nicer manipulations and manage-
ment of woman-kind, I confess my inability and
weakness."
Broadbent rolled up his eyes, and sighed.
" Bah !" said Lowenthal, contemptuously
" Didst thou ' Bah' to me, friend Lowenthal?
I'd rather thee wouldn't ' Bali' to me. I am
not a goat, that thou shouldst 'Bah' to me
after the manner of such I"
"Not a goat, but a donkey !" sneered tire
planter.
"The animal thou likenest me to, is- a most
useful, though not comely beast ; and like the
black chattel, worketh well when subjected to
man. Yet I would prefer to be likened to the
noble horse that combineth utility with beauty
and strength. And that remindeth me that it
seemeth a great mistake of Nature that the
Black Saxon was not made to go upon all fours,
like his co-worker, the ox."
Martin looked serious and reflective. His
employer stared at him.
"I can class the world under two heads," he
said, keeping his eyes on the Quaker. " Take
a sheet of paper and draw a line through the
centre of it. At the top, on the left of the line,
write fools ; on the right, write knaves ; and
under these two headings you and I and every--
body else may find our places."
" Nay, there are some foolish knaves and
some knavish fools," answered Martin, with im-
perturbable phlegm.
"That is but a variation on the same two
strings. You may ring the changes on them,
cut them into half-notes, quarter-notes,' or
eighths, flatten or sharpen them to your taste,
and they will still be the same. Pure folly and
pure knavery may not often be met with, but
we can afford to give the name to the prepon-
derating article. I have not classified you, yet,
Broadbent, and I'm sometimes afraid that you'll
go far to upset my system; but I'm after you,
like Agassiz after a fish ; and if we don't dis-
agree, we shall be good friends. Bht I'm watch-
ing you, Martin. - Don't get in my way, and
you won't be stepped on."
.The planter gave Martin a meaning glance.
" I should hate to have thee step on me !"
observed the latter.
" How is the girl Ela ?" asked L6wenthal,
abruptly. "I hope you haven't been too hard
on her. I didn't mean to submit Ifer entirely
to your damned cruelty. I trust she is well
enough ?"
He walked about uneasily.

"I never shall know thee better !" said Mar-
tin, impressively. "The heart knows when it
finds its mistress ; the-soul is conscious when it
is near it is kindred soul, and the contact and
thrill of an answering spirit is unmistakable.
I am not a man of theory, but a man of prac-
tice; yet practicality itself flows from the ideal.
But I will not weary thee. Forgive this much
to a simple-minded Quaker. Thou wilt not be
less safe for having inspired me with such feel-
ings. My love shall be about thee as a wall of
fire. Reflect on my poor offer. Accept or re-
fuse, as shall seem good unto thee. Meantime,
prepare to leave this evil place."
" A thousand thanks for your flattering opin-
ion t" returned Ela, whose self-possession was
now measurably restored. The unstudied utter-
ances of a noble mind .cannot but be received
with deference and gratitude. " Your goodness
shall not be misconstrued by me. Your senti-
ments neither shake my confidence nor inspire
distrust. I have faith in you. Let the future
decide your views of Ela. In regard to leaving
this place, I am entirely at your discretion."
She said this with so much modesty and
grace, that Martin's previous impressions were
greatly strengthened.
"We are friends," he said.
" In token of my friendship, here 1s my
hand," answered Ela. They shook hands, and
he held hers some moments- in his; then, with
some cheerful words, left her to make prepara-
tions for leaving the plantation.
CHAPTER     XXIV.
THE MEETING AT THE, CABIN,
Attended by Babel, the planter appeared at
Peter Rust's cabin at the appointed time.'
Markthaler was there. He -was sitting at a
rough pine table, and Jacob stood behind him.
The small interior was lighted by a single
lamp, which threv a fitful glare onthe pale face
and gray beard of the usurer, whose young fea-
tures contrasted most strikingly with his flow-
ing white hair. There was a certain classic
delicacy in the arch cf the brow, the turn of
the chin and nose, and the cut of the mouth,
that could not escape the attention of even
a common observer. There were, at times, a
sublimated sneer upon the lips and a haughty
quivering of the eyelids, that gave occasional
intimations of what was passing within.
"I expected," said Lowenthal, evidently dis-
appointed, " to meet you alone."
The money-lender pointed significantly at
Babel.
" He's a deaf mute," replied the planter to
this silent qeuery.
" Jacob is a 'deaf mute, when I wish him to
pe. Besides, be is not such a monster as your
Babel.. You perceive that. Jacob has regular
features and a fair person ; but yours is a very

chief. It is well he cannot speak, for one
might look for a dreadful voice out of that
body. Why didn't you bring the devil with
you, without any ceremony?
Markthaler drummed on the table with his
small, white hand. Babel, 'standing just' be-
hind his master, kept his large eyes on Mark-
thaler while he was speaking, and there was
something approximating to wonder in his ex-
pression. A thought, new and suggestive, was
working in his mentality.
" Stand behind me Jacob," added Markthaler.
"Sit there, 'Lowenthal, and put your moon-calf
where you like. There! Now what do you
want?"
~ " Not quite so imperative, good Jew !" an-
swered Lowenthal, frowning. "You are not in
your money-den at home. However," he said,
in a milder tone, "he that holds the purse con-
trols the sword. My want is not a new one ;,it
is chronic. You know, well enough, what it is.
What can you do for me ?"
"Nothing !" replied Markthaler with quiet-
ness.
" You will do nothing!" repeated Lowen-
thal, contracting his brows.
"That is it, sir."
The long taper fingers of the money-lehder
still drummed lightly on the table. It was an
aristocratic hand. The planter wondered why
it did not belong to a born gentleman, instead of
a usurer.
" Concerning those papers ?" he said, and
stopped.
" Go on."
Glancing over the planter's head, Markthaler
saw Babel's face working with emotion. The
idea that had crept into his dark head seemed
to have something startling in it.
"Have you brought them ?" asked Lowen-
thal.
" Jacob has them. Hold them up, Jacob."
Jacob held up a bundle of papers.
"One of those papers'I must have !" -said
Lowenthal, depressing his voice.
"Must is for kings and usurers," replied Mark-
thaler. 'i The fact is, Lowenthal, coffers have
bottoms, and all things have an end. Our busi-
ness is about done. I see no way of turning
you to any future account. You have no prop-
erty. What you had, and what you appeared to
have, is tied up in those papers. The negroes
don't belong to you, neither does the planta-

that you possessed before your second marriage.

Markthaler was grave and thoughtful, look-

CHAPTER XXVI.
AT REST.
Where the pine trees grew thickly, and ran
1p straight into the sky ; where the aged moss
hung in meshes from the boughs ; where the
laurel grew rank and clustering ; where the
wiry viies ran like serpents along the ground,
toiling around bushes and sturdy trunks; where
irds made their nests undisturbed ; where the
footsteps of man never trod ; where solitude
md silence, reigned ; where the quietude and
repose of Nature gave promise of security,
paused Peter Rust, with his weary charge. -
They had walked till the sun was higher than
he spires of the pine patriarchs ; they had
walked till Milrose's feet were faltering-till her
limbs trembled, and she was faint with exertion ;
hey had walked on and on, where there was no

Milrose was glad to .stop. Just ahead, dur-
ng this flight, went Little ]Dismal, turning, nowl
ndthen, his little, old face over his shoulder to]
ok back at Mars'r Peter and the two counter-
eit youths.
" Here," said Peter Rust, " we will rest."  -
He pointed, as he spoke, to a conical hut,1
sade of pine rift. This simple structure look-1

ger. I can walk day after day and not feel it1
but there's a difference atween nien and gals."

things, anyways," said Angeline, whose tongue
weariness had kept under restraint a long time.
" You're one the brave ones !" answered Pe-
ter, drily. " I obsarved, when Ben Dykes had
hold of your mistress, you  was full o' courage
and spirit."
" It wasn't Ben Dykes I's scared at," said An-
geline, tossing her head, "- but I's afeard he'd
burt Miss Mil'."
"Lome along, miss," said Peter, kindly,
stooping to enter the hut. " Here's a seat for
ye that the Queen of England might sit on
'thout complainin'."
He pointed to a .couch of boughs, covered
with the skins of animals.
Milrose sank upon this luxurious couch with
a feeling of exhaustion she had never before ex-
perienc d,
" This is a relief!" she sighed. " Are we safe
here, Mr. Rust ?"
'I think so. Only dogs can find us, least-
wise," lie replied, thoughtfully.
" Dogs ain't of no 'count," said Angeline,
with contempt. "Was brought up 'mong 'em
-lived with 'em. Dogs know me well enough."
The girl seated herself near her mistress.
" Tired most to death, I do believe," she con-
tinued. " Do fly round, Peter, and get us
something to eat. Don't 'epect we're going' to
live on nothin'--do ye ?  But you needn't be
particular ; a strong cup o' coffee, a tender ven'-
son steak, and some nice bread and butter'lldo
well enough. Laws ! we don't care what we eat,
anyways."
" You'll have to content yourself with some'at
less nor that," returned Peter, smiling. " I don't
keep a hotel here in the turpentine woods ; but
sicht as I can get, you shall have, right willin'."
Peter very cheerfully kindled a fire, and while
lie was bus" improvising a meal, Milrose and
Angeline fell aleep. The still-hunter looked
at them compassionately. The benevolence of
his nature was fully awakened. Milrose, so
young and fair, filled him with a soft and tender
admiration. She was more like a creation of
his ideality than a real flesh-and-blood maiden.
Peter Rust hind dreamed of such a being in
some of his happier slumbers in the forest ;
and now that he had accidentally fallen upon
the substance of the nocturnal shadow, he was
both pleased and surprised. But Peter had no
thought - of loving Milrose otherwise than ho'
would love a flower or a beautiful picture.

Written what you Wish. We must follow fate.
Bow 'to it' gracefully. Accept my friendship;
and if I may not love you, let me ever be able
to respect your character, and honor your high
and chivalrous nature."
She frankly held out her hand. Lovelace
took it sadly.
"'Lowenthal favored my ambition," he said,
in a mournful tone.
" You were deceived," answered Milrose, ear-
nestly.= "-Had my heart responded to your suit,
no one would so bitterly have opposed you as
Lowenthal."-
"Is this possible ?" exclaimed the colonel.
"Â«You- need not' doubt it. If he played one
part with you, with me he acted 'another. He
said to me : ' Beware of Lovelace ! His lands
and his negroes are swallowed up by creditors.
He has nothing but his commission and 'his
sword.' There i I have been frank with you.
It is-but justice to a man of honor !"
The Confederate officer held the little hand an
instant in his, then relinquished it, with a sigh.
His face was now flushed with resentment. '
" Your voice is truth," he replied, much dis-
turbed. " You have opened my eyes ;' I begin
to see clearly. He who deceives me once, will
*    not deceive me again. I have been misled.
Look, Milrose !" He pointed to the open door
of ,the hut. " The sun' ig going down ; so sink
my hopes; but,'like t e-sun, they will not rise
again. -The night o my disappointment has
come. But I shall not grope, whining'and com-
plaining, through the darkness.' I will'bear my
life-long regret like a man."
" You speak in a manner becoming your dig-
mity. ' I trust I shall continue to deserve your
good opinion. I left Lowenthal,'because I was
not safe there. A sense of danger continually
haunted me. That man was the husband of my
mother; but in him I feel that I have an enemy
of the most malignant character."
" For what reason is ie your enemy ?" Love-
lace asked. " He is bond by every law of hu-
manity-to protect you."
" Tell you what, Mars'r Lovelace !" cried An-
geline. - "lHe was goin' to shut her up in a
construction at the top o' the house. What did'
he put Peter Rust up there for, anyways? 'What
did they tote up so much lumber, and saws, and
hammers, and nails for? Be them kind o' con-
traptions wanted in a 'spectable family ?"
" All this is inexplicable !" exclaimed the col-
onel.
"It don't 'pear like myster'ous to me," re-
lied Angeline, with decision. " A young lady
gat owns two or three 'hundred niggers, and a
big plantation, and a fine house, and a good 'eal'

and things, isn't likely to get through the world

Angeline relieved herself of these expressions
with high-pressure rapidity, while the Confeder.
ate officer listened with increasing wonder.
Milrose was terrified by the volubility of her
maid. It is a notable fact, that plain people ar
apt to speak the plain truth. A porter will tell
more truths in an hour than a prince will tell in
a day.
" My maid," said Milrose, "is in the habit of
speaking her mind without consulting my wish-
es."     P
"In this instance, I am glad that it is so,"
answered the colonel ; "for her simple and
straight-forwarA declaration has given me a net
insight into your life, and the character of your
stepfather. I must believe that I have been a
dupe, however humiliating the thought. From
this moment, Miss Dorn, count me among your
friends."
He recalled the evidence of Hillhouse, and;
although it revived unpleasant associations, it
operated powerfully against Lowenthal. Anger
and pride served to elevate his feelings. If he
could not be an accepted lover, he could at least
be a faithful friend, and the protector of Milrose.
His line of conduct was quickly decided upon,
and reflected credit on his manhood.   He
blushed at the recollection of his injustice to
Frederick North. Blinded by his unfortunate'
passion, and hurried on by a false devotion to
the rebel cause, h .had been guilty of an act of
oppression which, iad it not been for the singu-
lar interference of the usurer, might have gone
on to crime. --
As he sat there, with bowed head, lie passed
through a great crisis of his life: He felt faint
and sick; lie trembled, he gasped ; and--and--.
he relinquished Milrose.
CHAPTER XXVIIL
FREDERICK NORTH DESERTS.
Frederick North did not intend to remain long
in the, Confederate service. He accepted the
gun and knapsack as the least of two evils. He
had no particular objection to being a soldier is
a cause receiving the sanction of his conscience;
but to bear arms against his country was wholly
repugnant to his feelings. The pure flame of
patriotism  burned brightly in his heart;, it
could not be extinguished by the lawless rule of,
the rebellious leaders.  The long-established'
order of things might be broken up; civil war
might prevail; terrorism might reign ; Union,
men might be hunted down like felons, and,
persecution appear in its most revolting shapes;

discovered the malice of Lowenthal and the
jealousy of Lovelace. His personal danger did
not cause him so much uneasiness as the -peril
that seemed to surround Milrose Dorn. The
words she had hurriedly spoken during their
short interview on the balcony, had been a fruit-
ful source of fear and doubt. His arrest and
detention could not have occurred at a time
more unlucky for his purposes ; and though he
bore his impressment into the rebel ranks with
outward calmness, his mind was in a whirl of
apprehension and impatience. Inwardly, he
abjured the seven-starred rag that floated over
him, and held in scorn and contempt the preten-
sions of the pseudo Government.
Frederick North was sleeping outside the
crowded little tent to which he had been assign-
ed. It was the second night of his stay at Camp
Royal. Wrapped in a dirty gray blanket, .he
was dreaming of Milrose, when he was awaken-
ed by a gentle pressure upon his arm. Open-
'ng his eyes, he beheld a large negro standing
ver him. ie looked at this dark apparition
ith a momentary fear. The moon was shining
an his sooty face and herculean person. Fred-
ick saw ugly scars on his face, that, apparent-
y, grew ghastly in the moonlight as he looked
tthem.. His lips were notably African, while
is eyes showed two white rims beaming ; like
wo dull stars. On one of his brawny, naked
imslte observed curious indented lines, as if
ot irons had been driven into his flesh.
The black stood motionless until assured that
1rederie was fully awake, then made signs for
iim to arise. The young man threw off his
lanket and arose. Babel touched him on the,
reast, then touched himself, and pointed tow-
rd the pine barrens.
" The sentinels ?" whispered Frederick, mak-
ng a gesture to the outer limits of the camp.
abel put his finger to his mouth and ears; to
ive him a knowledge of his feigned infirmities,
ad the next instant drew forth a bowie-knife
ot much seller than a broadsword. This
formidable weapon he kept ingeniously conceal-
d under his garments.
Frederick  was perplexed.   He knew   not
whether to follow or refuse. Escape was para-
ount in his thoughts ; but this might be a
rap set by his enemies. He could not quite
understand Babel. When he touched his mouth

ad he been sent, or had he come of his owq
ill?
These thoughts passed-rapidly through Fred-
rick's mind, and when Babel turned to go, he

was ready to follow. Hesoon perceived that
he had no inexperienced guide. He evidently
knew exactly where to - go. He did not ap-
proach the guard in a direct line, busin a cir-
cle that swept half way around the camp, and
that fell within the line of shadow of an avenue
of trees.
Frederick's faith in Babel increased at every
step ; so did his desire to get elear of the camp.
He expected every moment to be challenged
by a sentinel ; but nothing of the kind occurred.
The giant soon crept-upon one, but he lay stu-
pidly drunk upon the ground. Thenegro bent,
overhim, unclasped his resistless fingers from
his gun, and gave it to Frederick.
, They passed on, and were soon beyond the
limits of Camp Royal. The black walked faster
-and faster ; he strode toward the long margin
of forest with great rides. North spoke to
him several times,, by way of experiment, but
received no notice.
He saw Lowenthal's mansion lying pale un-
der the moonlight. While looking at it,. ie
could think only of Milrose. Her presence had
hallowed it. Her idea gave .a silent charm to
the dwelling and all connected with it. He
thought of Milrose as still there, exposed to that
unknown danger of which she had vaguely spok-
en. He stopped, without knowing it, aid con-
tinued gazing. Babel's hand upon his shoulder,
drawing him onward, aroused him from his rev-
erie of Milrose. Presently, ie found himself
standing before Peter, Rust's hut. A few days
before,-he had flattered-himself that he should
meet Milrose there ; but now that pleasing
hope seemed fir distant ; perhaps it had be"
come impossible. He, sighed gloomily, and
looked around for Babel ; he was gone. le
stood lone before the cabin of the still-hunter.
CHAPTER XXIX.
T HE LITTLE GUIDE.
While Frederick was wondering at the disap-
pearance of Babel, lie saw an object coming
toward him. He thought it was an animal ; but
presently it proved to be a black boy of very
small size, who approached him in a novel way,
tumbling heels over head, and revolving like
an animated wheel. He struck finally at Fred-
erick's feet, like an India-rubber ball ; the next
instant, his yard of length stood upright, and as
quietly and soberly as if he had always *talked
the earth like other mortals.
Although taken by surprise by this unexpect-
ed appearance, the young man now recognized
the little creature as a faithful follower of-Peter
Rust.
"Well, Swampsey, whatdo you want ?" asked
Frederick.
Little Dismal winked and blinked as fast as
lie could, but did not open his mouth.
"is Peter in the cabin ?" continued Frederick.
Swampsey shook his head solemnly. Every-

thing relating toPeer was, to his apprehension,I
a matter of the first consequence.
"Mars'r Peter's.gone," he replied.
"Gone where ?"     -
"4Come 'long Swvampsey," said the boy.
"Mars'r. Peter Leff dat yer." He -nodded his
head at the cabin. " Mars'r Peter can't stay in
.dat , yer. White folks want Mars'r Peter.
Mars't Peter got away from white folks. Keep
el'ar on 'em, now."
The swamp-foundling kept his blinking eyes
steadily on Frederick, and his little face grew
marvelously serious.
"Has Peter been in trouble ?"
" Shut him up, down you. Couldn't git out
-Mars'r Peter couldn't. Got a rope for him,
and he slid down from  dat yer bad place.
Spect dey won't cotch him ag'in. - Dat's all
'bout dis yer: Come 'long !"
Swampsey gave Frederick but little time to
deliberate, 'but started off promptly, and with a
celer'lty of movement that. the young man did
not care to imitate. There evidently being de-
sign in this, he followed his unique guide, con-
fident that he would not lead him into danger.
Sometimes, Swampsey was so far in advance
that he could with difficulty see him ; and in
several instances, when he thought he- had en-
tirely lost him, he came upon him unexpected-
ly, passing the time of waiting in turning sow-
ersets and walking on his hands. On one of
these oce isiois, he was considerably startled to
find the boy confronted by a thriftless-looking
man, with two dogs, at his heels, and who was
threatening him in a boisterous manner. His
elocution went after this fashion.
"You're Peter Rust's little nig - be ye?
You's dug out o' the:mud-wasn't ye ? Wall,
now, I reckon you're a fine speciment of a ape.
Can't mind yer own business, I s'pose-,can ye ?
Have to meddle with mine, promably ! Had to
come up to my shanty to tote off my little
drummer and trumpeter., That war not your
work, though ; you's put up to't by that am-
berlition no-'count, Peter Rust ! He sent ye
up you, though the Lord he on'y knows how
ye had wit 'nough to git thai, and remember
what was said to ye. I made up my mind, then
that I'd jest make' a el'ar eend of ye ; and I'm
now on the p'int o' doin' it. These yer dogs, I
reckon, '11- pull ye to pieces quicker nor they
would a possum."                 .
The fellow  stopped, made great' eyes at
Swampsey, and whistled to his dogs.
" Mars'r Peter tripped up yer heels !" answer-
ed thelad, winking and bliking rapidly. "You
ari't do noflin with Mars'r Peter !"
" Here, Jeff! Here-here-here !" cried Ben
Dykes. " At him, pup! Take him, Beau I"
Bat Beau crouched on the ground, and Jeff
alone mustered courage to\ assault Swampsey.
He sprang -at the lad's throat, but Swampsey
flung himself into the air, and alighted behind

the hound, which rushed on madly against s
tree. Turning to renew the'attack, he met with
no better success ; for Swampsy came don
on his back, and putting his black arms round
Jeff's neck, choked him till both eyes and
tongue protruded, and he bowled with pain ani
suffocation. Stung by pain, the hound did it
utmost to rid itself of its persecutor, and a bur
ry-scurry struggle ensued. Sometimes the dog
was uppermost, sometimes the boy, and then
was a violent scattering of leaves.
" Have done there !" vociferated Ben, alainm
ed for the safety of his bound. " Come off that
yer pup!   Wouldn't kill a innocent dog, wouk
ye ?"
But Swampsey had no sympathy for an inno
cent pup, and kept steadily at his business.
" Goddlemity 1" muttered Ben-; "what a spry
critter he in ! Should think he's made of eel
and wild-cats. Git out there, or l'llc ut you
weasand !"
Ben drew his bowie-knife from his trowser'
leg, where he always carried it, with the poin
sheathed in his boot. It was a novel applica
tion of a common adjunct of low Southern se
ciety ; but Benjsinin Dykes found it exceedia
ly convenient and within reach, and when draw
out in-a swaggering manner, that piece of ste
had an excellent moral effect on the beholden
and on various occasions had 'done ore t
abash his adversaries than itS actual us
Cutting the air with this ugly instrument
making a disagreeable, whizzing sound, the doi
trainer advanced upon the combatants, inten
ing to make a thrust, at the critical moment
when there was no dog between Swa'mpsey as
the ground-.
" Goddlemity !" exclaimed Ben, lugubriously
" I'm afeard some'at '11 happen to Jeff. Hoi

nothin' but a no 'count nigger, anyway. I']
browse you, my lad, for this ! Let go, nig !,le
go, dog !"
Dykes poised his knife over the floundering
pair, but there was no time that it could de
send without endangering the canine, and the
tender-hearted owner perspired with concern.
At this juncture Frederick- North, who hal
been a silent observer of most of this scene, ni
longer able to repress his indignation, advance
suddenly upon Ben, and with the barrel of hii
gun gave him such a sharp rap across the knuck
les, that he dropped his knife and daneed ab -
like a 'trained bear in a menagerie. He wo
also have tickled his ribs with his bayonet, ha
he not quickly taken himself away. Havial
y erformed this meritorious action, he reached
down, seized the hound by the hlape of the neck
tore him from Swampsey's grasp and flung hisn
at his master with such force that, striking hid
across the stomach, he drove the breath front
his lungs and knocked him flat upon his back.

tortion and the extortioner, and his grief is not
for the lost fortune, but for her who loses it."
"You abuse your master's goodness, Jacob,"
said Markthaler, softened somewhat.'
" It is his goodness that makes me speak
plainly," answered Jacob, with humility.
This scene bewildered Frederick. He stared
first at one, then at the other. Inexplicably
enough, the 'money-lender was obtaining an as-
cendency over him.,
They walked on slowly, each thoughtful, and
Frederick in a maze of doubt.
" And so you love her, young man ?" said
Markthaler, by-and,-by, turning upon North,
suddenly.
" Had one asked me that question, entitled to
a calm and truthful reply, I should have answer-
ed with the frankness of a boy,' 'with all my
heart l' Nor would that have expressed the
depth and intensity of my 'devotion. She has
become a part of my existence. If my soul has
an aspiration, it is for Milrose ; if it hasa voice,
it continually speaks her name : my, thoughts,
my dreams, are of her. But yqu, sir, know
nothing of a passion like this. If you have a
love, it is the love of' gold ; if you worship,
aught, you bow the knee and the spirit to bonds,
deeds, securities, and bursting coffers."
Frederick made a gesture of infinite contempt
toward the usurer.
"How well lie reads us, Jacob !" cried the
money-lender, with a singular blending of mirth
and bitterness.
" Think of your hoards, and trouble me no
more," added Frederick, moodily.
" Think of whom you will, and come along !"
retorted Markthaler. And the parties walked
on silently.
CHAPTER     XXXI.
AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT.
It was nearly morning when Peter reaebed
the hut. The darkness that precedes the dawn
lay heavily on the pines. Emerging- from the
thick inclosure of trees, Frederick entered the
little opening in which the still-hunter had
built hms humble habitation. The first thing
that met his sight was a cheerful fire blazing
ruddily a few yards from the door of the hut.
The next object that drew his attention, was a
figure wrapt in a military coat, reclining upon
some pine foliage near the burning fagots.
Upon this recumbent form young North fasten-
ed his eyes with great interest. There was
something in the quiet outlines of the unknown
person that seemed not unfamiliar to him. This
silent guardian was either sleeping, or mentally
lost in reverie ; for he did not change his atti-
tude until Peter Rust was close upon him. He
started up, however, in alarm, before Peter was
near enough to touch him. Retreating in a be-
wildered manner, he drew a pistol from his
breast-pocket, exclaiming

" Who comes! Who comes!"
" Put up your little joker, colonel," answered
Peter, " for there's no danger. Must have been
sleeping pooty sound not to have heerd us com-
In'.', ,
" I have not been sleeping," said Lovelace, in
a hollow voice, his abstracted air still clinging
to him.
The man's tones made Frederick's heart leap
under his Confederate jacket. Lovelace, his
judge, and his rival, stood before him.
Frederick still wore the rebel jean. His knap-
sack he had left at camp, bnt'his cartridge-box,
containing several rounds of powder and ball,
he had brought away ; while upon his shoulder
he carried the musket which Babel had taken
from the'sleeping sentinel.
There he was face to face with the colonel of
the Beaufort Guard-a deserter discovered in
the very act of flight. But the circumstances
were such that he had no qualms of conscience
respecting the desertion, and yet the rencontre
was, for various reasons, unpleasant. Peter of
the Pines lie could rely upon in any emergency,
but of Markthaler and the yellow Jacob he was
not so certain. As North's surprise abated, a
feeling 'of proud resentment took its place. He
recalled the recent arrogance of the man, at a
time when he- had him wholly at his mercy ;
nor did he forget that to Lovelace he wasin-
debted for his unjust and proscriptive degradi-
dation to the rebel ranks.. The idea of Milrose
went sweeping through his'iiiagination, coloring
and intensifying his feelings.,
The two men stared at each other. To Love-
lace it was a moment of bitterness. The sight
of Frederick made him terrribly sensible of
his own disappointment. To that overpowering
grief which the final rejection of Milrose had
occasioned, was now added a darker and more,
dangerous sentiment. He struggled hard to re-
press the sterner and fiercer part of his nature,
and to practice that magnanimity which he had
)'esolved upon while' in the presence of MissI
Dorn. Seeing the young man before him, whom
lie was conscious lie had dealt harshly with, all
his powers of self-control did not suffice to pre-
vent a slight reddening of his cheeks ; it was
manhood's instinctive tribute to honor.
But something must be said ; a fact of which
Lovelace was well aware.
"How dare you leave your regiment, sir ?"
lie demanded, haughtily.
Frederick threw his musket contemptuously
to the ground. He advanced deliberately upon
the colonel, and folding his arms upon his chest,
confronted him with a most natural and digni-
fied assumption of pride. Within, he glowed
like a furnace ; but he tried to be calm.
"It is time to drop this mockery, sir," he
said, with tolerable composure.  " You may
have a regiment, Colonel Lovelace, but I have
none. .You are in this rebellion, heart and

,

soul, but know, sir, that I am for the Union and
the old flag ! Talk not to me, sir; of regiments
and subordination ; I scorn such contemptible
assumptions of authority. ~ Think you I can
forget that shallow mockery at Lowenthal's,
which you called a trial. You cannot ,make a
rebel of -a man by forcing him into a suit of
rebel jean, and giving him a musket and a
knapsack. Treason must be in the heart, sir !"
" Sir! sir !" stammered Lovelace. "You for-
get your position ! I order you back, sir !"
"Let- this, arrogance cease, sir," answered
Frederick, indignantly. "I am your equal by
birth and education; and possibly," he  added,
with a perceptible sneer ; " I may not be below
you in fortune."
"Do not insult me I" said the colonel, biting
his lips. "I- am not in a mood to be trifled
with."
He laid his hand upon his sword."
" I have no sword," resumed North, "ut
should be most happy,.when equally armed, to
give you every satisfaction in mny power."
"I have pistols," replied Lovelace, whose an-
ger was getting the better of his discretion ;
'fbut perhaps," he continued with evident con-
tempt for his adversary, "you have no predi-
lections for lead."
" Pistols will do," said Frederick eagerly.
" Produce them quickly, and away with words."
Marktlialer, who had been an earnest listener,
approached. and said to the colonel,-in a low
voice :
"You are forgetting your rank, sir."
North heard the words, and they fired his
heart.
" If lie takes refuge behind his rank, .he is a
coward !" he exclaimed.
"Love o' God !" interposed another voice,
with such emphasis that Frederiek turned invol-
untarily to look for the person who had spoken.'
Guided by the fire-light, his gaze rested on the
figure of a youth of sixteen or seventeen-years
of age, wearing, like himself, the Confederate
jean. A species of fascination kept .him from
withdrawing his eyes from this mal-apropos
intruder.
"It 'pears like they're going to cut each'
other's throats. We can't have no such earr'in's
on, here, anyways!  Laws, Peter! why don't
you step in and stop that yer 1 So'mebody '11'
be swoundin' away, the first thing you dunno !"
Frederick's wonder grew to exaggerated di-
mensions. Had lie heard that voice before ? A
latent consciousness told him he had heard one
wondrously like it; but it was associated with
one of the other sex ; while here, standing dis-
tinctly in his sight, was a dark-skinned, but not
uncomely boy. He was trying to make this
matter clear to his apprehension, when Peter'
Rust advanced briskly, with his double-gun in
his hand, and said, with a deprecating sweep 'of
his long arm:
re

77

" These here are my premises, gentlemen,
and I'll have no wrangling' on 'em, I allow ! Live
, folks are worth some'at,, but dead ones ain't
scarcely of no account whatsomever. Put up
your tools, knen, and settle your differences
som'ers else."
f   Swampsey went and stood just beside Peter,
and winked and blinked in his most solemn
fashion. The contrast between the two was no-
table ; but none of the parties found leisure to
mark the striking. difference between six feet
two and three feea othing.
There was a lull in the storm. The principals
in the altercation scowled and looked away from
each other in a-most unamiable manner.
- North' was about to address some apulogeti-
cal words to Peter of the Pines, when a new
claimant to his attention' appeared, in the shape
of another youth very similar to the first, al-
though more-delieately formed, more regular in
features, and of lighter complexion.
Lads of fifteen and sixteen, and near that pe-
riod of life, have certain characteristics in corn-
mon, and few of them attract particular notice
when met casually, either in the street or any
other place ; but this youth, as he hesitatingly
drew near the parties, instantly and unaccounta-
bly became an object of interest to North. The
blazing brands reflected a strong light upon his
face, the delicacy and beauty of which might
well excuse a gaze of wonder.- His figure, too,
had equal claims for observation, presenting
those rounded lines and symmetrical proportions
that give grace and harmony to tie human form.
Perplexed, without knowing why ; bewildered,
without apparent cause ; interested without any
reason he could think of, his incidental glance
became a gaze, and his gaze a stare.
The youth made a beseeching gesture to Peter
Rust, displaying, as he did so, a hand childishly
small.- Frederick looked downward, and saw a
pair of feet to match the hand.
The silent adjuration of the boy had an.im
mediate effect on Peter.
" The young man' seems to have forgot ten the
pistols," saidl Lovelace,, derisively, watching the
direction of Frederick's eyes.
"Quite the contrary!"'retorted the young
man, his anger, which had subsided a little,
flashing up again.  "I think you will never
find an antagonist more willing to meet you
than I. Let Mr. Markthaler arrange the pre-
liminaries without loss- of time. Any terms
that are equal will suit me. Twelve paces, or
twenty, or muzzle to breast, are the same to.
me."
Frederick's de portment was usually distin-
guished for its modesty and the absence of every-
thing to draw-notice upon himself; but now his
air was bold, and his bearing proud and confi.
dent. The taunt of Lovelace had stung him,
and he was hot to renew the dispute, and end it
by an appeal to the deadly duet.

" I ordered him back to his regiment," said
Lovelace. "But I came not to speak of this ;
I came to take leave of you."
" I can believe, sir, that it is not a subject you
like to dwell upon. It is seldom agreeable to
recall a wrong we hive done to another. I have
heard the details of that mock-trial, conducted
by yourself and Lowventhal. Some other feeling
than loyalty governed your actions. Sir, I am
not a lawyer ; but a simple sense of justice
teaches me that your duties had nothing to do
with Frederiek North, and that the whole thing
was an unwarrantable stretch of power, discred-
itable to you and tjhe other party concerned.
You forced him into the ranks of your regi-
ment. Wishing to degrade, you certainly ex-
hibited great'discrimination in your sentence ;

and noble qualities of her soul were spoitane-

Lovelace sighed. - That sigh came from his.
heart; his heart so empty, so hopeless, so dis-
pairing.

bad reasons, his fatal sophistries, received un-

""If  rederick is loyal," added Milrose, " my
tegrt will rejoice in his loyality."
"Loyal to what ?" asked Lovelace.

79

" To liberty and the Union."
" Then it is as I believed," said Lovelace.
"He is a secret enemy of the Confederate Re-
public. In making this avowal, Miss Dorn, you
place your lover in a dangerous position. Do
not forget to whom you are speaking."
" I am speaking to a rebel officer, responded
Milrose.
The colonel's face flushed in a moment.
" I would thank you, Milrose,".he returned,
curtly, " to bestow on me a name less offensive.
We are Revolutionists, not rebels."
" A distinction, sir, which the world will' not'
make. History will record a different verdict."
"I care not," resumed Lovelace, after a pause,
" what history calls it. Posterity is for others,
and not for me. In loving you, I lose fame,
name, heart, and ambition."
Emotion choked his utterance. .4 few mo-
ments passed before he was able to proceed.
Milrose was too much affected by his mournful
tone to interrupt him..
"-The motive-power of life is gone. The
hopes, the expectations, the aspirations of ex-
istence have departed. I care not what wind
drives me out to sea. I shall float aimlessly on
the tide. Often and often my thoughts will re-
vert to thee. Thou art the pole-star, the lode-
b ne of my soul ; it turns to thee like the nee-
dle to the north."
ie' stopped again, but quickly added :
"Enough ! This is painful to you and to me.
I shall ,trouble you no more. Duty will soon
call md 'away. I shall go hence to meet the.foe.
But not the red glare of battle -not the thun-
derous peal of cannon -not'the deadly hailof
musketry, nor the bristling of bayonets, nor
the shock of charging squadrons, shall turn my
fe iohts, from  thee, nor pale my face with
fear.
" Go, sir, I entreat of you !" exclaimed Mik
rose. "You grieve me beyond measure."
" It is the' last time, Milrose. Have pa-
tienee."
Hi, tones were sadder than his face.
" Rear- my confession. I will not be an utter
traitor to honor. Let Frederick North keep out
of my wey. I hate temptation. God knows
what'I might do-t do not. The man that ex-
cites your love, excites an opposite emotion in
me. You have bestowed upon him life and
hope : but I-Heaven pardon me !-would re-
verse these gifts. If yon would save me from
being a villain, send him from the country at
one. .Let himn fly, and look not behind 'him.

within me a spark of latent hate, which may be
fanned to a flame by the' time I reach camp.
Hide him ; hurry him hence; screen hinm from
the reflex tide of my jealousy. There ! I have
done my duty. If this Frederick North, if this
abolition traitor, this secret enemy of the Con-
federacy, meet with a tragical fate, remember
that you were advised of it beforehand. And
now, Milrose, I go. Should we meet again on
earth, may it be to be happier, or to find the
glowing passions of our hearts burned out and
dead. Better to be a clod, than to love in vain.
Better be insensible to the softer touches of na-
ture, than to feel a passion we cannot ourselves
inspire."
Bowing low to Milrose, Colonel Lovelace
passed from the hut with slow steps and heavy
heart, leaving Milrose in a'whirl of unpleasant
thoughts. Without speaking a word to any one,
the Confederate officer went silently and sor-
rowfully from Peter's retreat, and it was soie-
time before it was known to the parties without
that he had gone.
CHAPTER XXXIIL
PETER SPEAKS HIS MIND ABOUT MILROSE.
Frederick saw the Confederate officer enter'
the hut with 'feelings of jealousy and alarm.'
Why did he follow Milrose? What relation did
they at that timesustain to each other?' Why
was Milrose there?
He reflected. A most painful thought crept
insidiously into his brain. The girl had per-
haps forgotten her sweet assuranes, and-fled
with Lovelace in the disguise in which he had
found her. He asked himself if that was not a
natural inference growing'out of the situation.
The probabilities, it struck him, were strong in
favor of this' view of the ease. He tortured
himself with that possibility.  His dislike of
Lovelace increased. His protracted stay inthe
hut terrified him ; it.confirmed his worst fears.
What right had he there ? Why was notAnge-,
line with her mistress? Why did she sit sleep-
ily' at the door, while Lovelace was admitted
to the very sanctuary of innocence?  He per-
suaded himself that there was more in this 'at'
taehment of his rival than he had hitherto un-
derstood.'
He seated himself on the couch of boughs
recently occupied by Lovelace, with-feelings of
distraction and bewilderment that rendered him
miserable.
Peter was busy for a time with Markthaler
and Jacob. He saw those persons conversing'
apart, but engrossed in his own doubts and fears,
gave them but little notice.
Presently Peter came to him, and observing
his depression of spirits, said, in 'a kindly tone':
" Cheer ii lad ! Nothin'- is so had as it
seems at fi-' Gals is an uncertain thing ; but
they are easy managed arter you get the run
on 'em."

"I am afraid," answered North, desponding'
ly, "that I have never been so fortunate as
to get the run of them    to use your own
wor s."
" There's some," added Peter, shaking his
head in, perfect-conviction of the truth of what
he was saying, " that can't be-trusted."
Peter glanced mildly at the newly-risen sun,
then adde d, with a benevolent expression :
" Then'ag'in, there's them that can."
" Explain all this," cried Frederick, no lons,
ger able to control his suspense. "Why is she
here ? Answer me without delay."
" Go and ask her," answered Peter. "If you
want to know some'at of a woman, go to that
wdman and ask her."
" I thought you might save me that trouble,"
said Frederick, moodily.
" But I won't," returned Peter, bluntly.
"What she wants ye to know, she'll tell ye ;
and what she 'don't want ye to know, that 1
know, I sha'n't say nothin' about. I don't be=.
tray none sich as her. She's too good and too
pretty not to have her own way about every-
thing."
" I thought she was an, angel not long since,"'
said North, cynically.
" Well, what do you think ofbher, now ?" ask.
ed Peter, gruffly.
"Answer that yourself, Peter. I find her in
the pine barrens, in male attire, attended by
Colonel Lovelace, an old admirer. In their
good company there is but -one person, and
that person 'a mulatto girl, a slave, and in the
same anomalous guise. Think of the time, the,
place, the hour-; then put all these together,
and speak hopefully to me, if you can."
" Be careful what you say, young man," an-
swered Peter of the Pines, sharply. "If another
had said what you have been sayin', some'at.
would have happened to him afore he'd got
through with it. I remimber well enough where
I first see her ; how onexpected she came , what

upon his heart, and sighed so softly that the
sound was like the murmuring of the pine'
leaves. Frederick,'partialIy raised himself, and.

The steadfast look of the money-lender ; the
severe tone in which he spoke ; the startling
import of his words, surprised, and epibarrassed
North. It seemed to him that a new piase o(
the subject was presented., The'ioneylender
had, unquestionably, made..an allusion to lil-
rose. What was the meaning pf.this?, By.what,
right did he pretend to exert a controlling influ-
ence over that yopng .lpdy ?., These thoughts
coursed through his mind very rapidly.
"Your last remarks," said Frederick,:anon,
"lead me to inferences that are not altogether
clear."
Wacob made significant motions to North over
his master's head,               .
" I have offered you the road to Milrose and
fortune," answered the money-lender,,impress-
ively,"' hod you have refused to tale it."
" How can I leave her unprotected ?" exclaim-
ed Frederick, throwing off the restraint which
he had imposed upon his feelings.    1
" Trouble yourself not about Miss Dorn,"
said Markthaler, frigidly. "She needs not your
courage to'defend her from danger. To other
hands will be intrusted the care of her person.
To-morro y'she will be far frgi here."
Jacob continued to gesticulate behind his
master, and Frederick was beginning to see that
he was dealing with one whose power was great-
er than he had previously suspected. But the
secret of- this power baffled him. He feared he
had already mnide a fatal mistake. He hastened
to retrace hisgeps, to regain, if possible, the place
he had lost in .the esteem of this strange man.
" Be not in haste, sir," he said, considerably dis-
concerted. "I have not yet decided to refuse to
be the bearer of thpse dispatches you have men-
tioned. I will ow.n, sir, that you-have held out

Jacob made an approving motion.     -
"Do you -hear this infatuated boy, Jacob ?"
asked Markthaler, appealing to the mulatto.
"Yes, mars'r," he replied.. "He is going to
accept."
" Do not encourage him, Jacob. Let him
choose for himself," responded Markthaler, with

his feelings, And phe mute entreaties of the

He arose to go.
"Is ther9 to more, sir?", sked Frederick,
anxiously. ." Did yo. .not, speak of Milrose ?

Markthaler turned upon Frederick suddenly,
,and said, with. an carnestygss that .he had not
exhibited before during the interview :

you may never gainn behold her. I hold her
destinies in my hand. As I will, she will act.

The, words of the usurer fell with thrilliu
effect upon Freleriek. TIe would have smile

ringing in his ears, he could not find it  ,is

" What you tell, me seems incredible4!" he
stammered, turning, with a strange sense of be-

ceiving any reply, he looked up a moment after,
and percei-ed tha4t he was alone.

Frederick North returned to the but, meditat-
ing upon what he bad heard. In this case, re-
flection brought no light.  The question re-
mained unsolved. He did not weary of it, how-
ever. Markthaler was an object of increasing
curiosity. His singular manners andhis extraor-
dinary face were continually dwelt upon.

mind."
"My decision was made an hour ago," an
swered Frederick, beginning to examine th(
papers placed before him, on one of which was
drawn elaborate plans of Forts Beauregard and
Walker.- Having satisfied himself of the value
of these documents, he again expressed his wil-
lingness to attempt to carry them to the Fed-
eral flag-ship. .These plans and specifications
had been made upon the thinnest and lightest of
paper, and Peter Rust, taking them in hand,
very ingeniously quilted them into the linings
of his coat. This consumed considerable time,
and the afternoon was well advanced when
Frederick was ready to commence his danger-
ous journey. He was to set out in no other
disguise than 'the Confederate gray;" and, in-
deed, it would have been difficult for him to
have procured any other in the vicinity of Low-
enthal's.
" Who will guide me from this wood ?" he
asked, when there was no longer anything to
detain him.
" I have a guide for ye," said Peter. " A
guide. asfpis as different from all others, as was
ever seen': 4 guide as will go as no other cree-
tur can go.,A guide as is not large in size, but
full of all Ianner of locomotions' and propul-
sions. - A guiqe who loves nothin', and fears
nothin'."
"here is he ?" inquired Frederick, looking
showw him to ye," replied Peter, be-
to whistle as if he were calling a dog.
'lihdiately Swampsy came somersetting to
the spot, in a most reckless and eccentric fash-
don.
"There he is," resumed Peter, as the lad
found a resting-place on the crown of his head,
with his two legs and the soles of two black lit-
"tle feet pointed like tridents to the skies.
" There he is, Mr. North, and it don't make
-any odds which way he goes.- Self-adjustin'
and self-movin', little Dismal is. Don't have to
touch no springs to start him, and when once in
motion, there ain't nothin' on airth can'come up
to him.
Swampsey' filliped over on to his feet, and
took on, with marvelous facility, one of his
most solemn and impressive countenances, the
fellow of which could not be found in the whole
of oottondom.
" A yard long," pursued Peter. " An insti-
tution and a contraband, a chattel and a cattle,
as Martin Broadbent would say ; but he can
=guide you, not only out of the pine barrens, but
to Beaufort itself, and by highways and by-
ways and slyways that you've -no idea of."-
"This black dwarf guide me to Beaufort !"
exclaimed Frederick. "You are jesting, Mr.
Rust."
" Can you show' him the way to Beaufort,

r little Dismal ?" asked Peter, turning to Swamp
sey.
The foundling winked and }blinked, and wag.
gled his head like anfeducated seal.
3." You needn't be afeared to trust him," con.
I tinued Peter. "He don't talk much, 'but he
knows 'a heap o' eunnin' tricks. If he don'
keep clear of the prison secesh, it won't be f
want of the natur' of the fox."
f-'dI have entertained a high opinion of you
judgment, Peter, but in this instance I confess
I distrust it," replied Frederick.
"Poor little gymnastics i" said Peter, re-
flectively. " Iobody trusts in him. Nobody
believes in him; but he's helped me more'
once."
Help )Iars'r Peter !" drawled Swampsey,
his dar   countenance   becoming  animated,
" Help Mars'r Peter "
" He was my guide last night," said Freder
ick, "and his instincts were sufficiently sharp
for the purpose. But _the undertaking before
me is a d erent affair, and I fear the lad would
encumber rather than aid me. He might be a
clog upon my movements, rather than the use-
ful creature you are inclined so think him."
"He'll be no drag upon ye," responded
Peter. "He can take care of himself better nor
most people. But I don't just like that rebel
jean that you're wearin'. Howsomever, if you
can get beyond the reach    of the Beaufort
Guards, it'll answer very well ; but if Capin
Middlcton gits hold of ye, you'll be shot asn
desarter. If you haven't traveled that road
much, you won't know which is the safest ; but
Swampsey has been there With me at a time
when it wouldn't been safe for us to be seen by
certain rabid disunionists. If you see hium
throw a double Somerset and rund s fast as
never hie can, why, take the hint and skedaddle
after him. Farewell, Frederick, and come back
safe !"
The shook hands, but Frederick still linger-
ed.It wished to have spartingY word with
Milrose. He was going onan errand from
which he might never return, and desired to re-
new his vows and bid her adieu.
SGo," said Ma         '.kthaler; "there is nothing to
detain vou. I know why you loiter; but is in
vain. You have said to her all that you need
say. You have vowed by the moon and the
stars ; you have sworn by everything movable
and immovable; you have poured ft madora
tion by the canto ; you have sighed by the hour,
and I see no more for love-sick ingenuity to
perform."
Although the money-lender tried to speak
very gravely, his tones lacked that severity
which he wished to enforce.
Frederick was about to reply with some eat,
when Peter prevented him I'aking the aoug
man by the arm, the still-hunter ivalkel  tIl
him soe distance on his wanterwa k wit,

hiin, in a friendly manner, the virtue of patience,
and the value of wholesome self-restraint.
'North endeavored, by various expedients, to
draw from Peter some definite knowledge of the
usurer, but was foiled at every point. Of one
thing, however, he felt perfectly assured ; and
that was, that Markthaler was ,not what he as-
sumed to be. That he exercised, or was about
to exercise, an influence over Milrose, he 'as
more than ever disposed to believe. Parting
from Peter, be followed his little guide through
the pines, in a state of dreamy doubt and uncer-
tainty concerning the, circumstances that so
strangely surrounded him.
C      ER XXXVIII.
FREDERICK DIS CARDS THE ADVICE OF HIS GUIDE.
Frederick pursued his solitary way. The
sombre shadows of hight soon enwrapt the for-
est like i vast mantle. He could scarcely see
the little figure 9f Sivampsey as he ran along
before him. He asked no questions, he made
no conversation with his pigmy conductor.
Thoughts of Milrose, Markthaler, Lowenthal,
and Lovelace engrossed him'for a long time.
The night grew older; the stars came out, and
the moon now and then sailed 'out from among
the clouds, and cast upon his pathway soft,
white gleams of light, which quivered like elec-
tric flashes on the dead pine-leaves. Frederick
had at that time little consciousness of his mis-
sion. It is true that he intended to discharge
his duty with courage and zeal, but there was a
sweet dream of Milrose upon him all that night.
Every kind word ; every gentle look ; every
tender fiash of the eyes ; every beaming smile ;
every stray, ringlet fluttering over her white
cheek, and all the graces of her person, were re-
membered and dwelt upon with all a lover's de-
licious infatuation.
It is certainly a great pity to drag a lover
rudely from-his first Alden, and to obtrude very
commonplace things upon his attention in his
moments of exaltation ; .but' Frederick was
brought out of his enchanted catalepsy by the
discharge of a musket, and the warning music
of a bullet passing near his person, and striking
the branch of a tree beyond him.
Swampsey, on hearing this salutation, saltated
very high, and came down very low, and looked
around very seriously.
Frederick drew a pistol which Markthaler
had provided him with, and was attempting to
discover the source of danger, when Swampsey
said:        -
" Mars'r Fred," and pointed with his finger.
North looked in the direction indicated, and
caught glimpses of the Confederate gray mov-
ing about among the trees. He comprehended
the situation at once. Some of the Beaufort
Guard were out searching for him. The conse-
quences of capture he well 'knew, and he re-
solved not to be taken al e. He was not de-

cided which way to go, not' knowing the nums
ber of his pursuers, nor at what points they
might lie concealed. Little Dismal settled the
matter, and if he did not end the doubt, he did
the irresolution.
" Come 'long, Mars'r Fred,'' said Swampsey,
and ran as fast as'he could.
North remembered the injunctions of Peter,
and followed him. A harm less volley of mus-
ketry rattled among the trees just behind them.
It was to Frederick a very novel flight, but by
no means wanting in the excitement which dan-
ger lends to adventure. Swampsey s methods
of propulsion were exceedingly varied. Some-
times Frederick was confident that the black
dwarf was soberly adhering to the earth in the
accepted order of nature, and at the next mo-
ment was equally certain that he was revolving,
end over end, on an equinoctial line drawn just
below his stomach. But in whatever fashion lie
went, the young man had difficulty in keeping
up with him, and at the expiration of ten min-
utes, was in a profuse perspiration, and very
willing to.halt, if such had been the will of his
conductor. They presently emerged from the
forest, and were fairly launched on the planta-
tions, across which Swampsey led the way with
tireless speed. This continued till Frederick
was nearly ready to sink down'from exhaustion.
He had heard 'pursuit at the outset, but lost
sound of it before leaving the woods.
Swampse guided him so adroitly,   at they
evaded 'te houses of the planters arid 'equar-
ters of the negroes. From  a high ridge of
ground he could see, when lie stopped, Lowen-'
thai's mansion, the roof of which was 'silvered
with moonlight. The sight gave him mingled
feelings of pleasure and pain. It was there he
had seen Milrose ; it was on those silent grounds
that his heart had been captivated ; it was in
one 'of those pleasant walks that, with pale
cheeks and agitated voice, he had dared to woo
her.
"Come 'long, Mars'r Fred," admonished
Swampsey.
"But where are we going, my lad ?" asked
North.
" Goin' 'long, Mars'r Fred. Runnin' -'way
from the men with guns. Sogers kill Mars r
Fred, if they cotch him."
" I must go toward Beaufort, at all events,"
added Frederick.
" Go there with Mars'r Fred," muttered
Swampsey.    '
"Where is Beaufort ?" inquired Frederick,
desirous of testing the knowledge of the lad.
" Down you," replied the foundhing, nodding
toward the seacoast.
As vague as this answer was, he was forced ti
be content with it. His guide gave him little
time for reflection and choice, but led st right on
across fields of cotton, through upland and low-
land, through wet and dry, regarding with sub-

" Meaning me," said Frederick, calmly.

North now ceased to regret the lost dispatch-
es, for now there was a possibility that they
might have fallen into worse hands, or, at least,
come into possession of those Wrho would be
glad to use them to his disadvantage.
He was hurried to the farm-house hoe had so
recently left,3iid dragged into it with more en-
ergy than hadness. With many threats and
much roughness, he ,wAs thrust into a corner,
and ordered not to stir, on pain of being sum-
marily dealt with. The Confederates then un-
strung their knapsacks, and distributing them-
selves about th% room, drew forth the rations
which they had brought with them, and began
to make themselves comfortable. Several sug-
gestive flasks appeared, which passed 'rapidly
from one to another, and with marked effect;
for presently they became boisterously merry,
and told wonderful stories of the cowardice of
the Federals, and of their own exploits. Fred-
-rick was offered nothing in the way of good
heer, but more than enough in the wa. of
abuse. They called him a great many hard
names, and assured him, in every style of dec-
lamation, that he was sure to be shot as a de-
serter on reaching camp.  All this, as may be
believed, did not have a very inspiriting effect
upon North, who began to believe, seriously,
that his last hour was near. From Lovelace he
could expect no favors. The relations which
they respectively sustained to Milrose, left him
little room for hope.  Lowenthal he had equal
reason to dread. Between the two, he doubted
not but the fate promised laim by the corporal
and his rough crew would be remorsely meted

CHAPTER XXXI-
THE FARM-HOUSE.
As the soldiers grew hilarious they became
uisitive, and in searching -about the house,
covered a keg of whisky. Now, for their
own good, they had better have found a keg of
;unpowder; for gunpowder is easily let alone,
tit whisky is not. These gallant fellows made
ueh an assault on this dangerous magazine,
hat several of them were, in a short time put
rs de combat, and were forced to lay down both-
heir arms and their legs on the floor. On ac-
ount of this mishap,.the corporal, who, to tell

the truth, was but little better off, was cormpeil-
ed to remain at the farm-house: till his-confeder-
abes should be in a condition to shoulder arms
and right about face, march. This was one of
the casualities of war which could no more be
provided against than battles or cannon-balls.
Corporal Bently swore an oath or two, then
mollified and moistened his wrath by a pro-
tracted suction at the keg. After getting his
breath, which, for a -few moments, he thought
had slipped away into the keg and was lost, lie
put two of the soberest men to guard Frederick,
then seating himself, with his tack against the
door, soon lapsed into a rum sleep, in which he
dreamed of Confederate cotton, Confederate ne-
groes, and-Confederate scrip. Bull Run and
divisions of flying Federals doubtless entered
into. the composition of his vagaries, together:
with a prophetic view of the greatness and
prosperity of the magnanimous South Carolina
nation.'
The two men set apart, to keep watch and
ward upon Frederick North, distrusting their
own powers of endurance, and willing to pro-
vide for contingencies, proceeded, in spite of
remonstranc-s, to tie their prisoner's ankles to-
gether with a stout cord, which they found by
rummaging about the house. Having by this
remarkable foresight met 'the danger in ad-
vance, they had more leisure to attend to ' their
personal comfort. Some of their comrades,
who yet remained sober enough for that duty,
went out and examined the poultry-yard ; and
finding nothing to reward their trouble, came
back in bad temper, and were obliged to have
two respective and serious struggles with said
keg before their disappointment would soften-;
but the most obdurate ill-nature'will yield, after-
a time, to the benign influences oz, new corn
whisky that is a dead-shot at forty reds.
If the author had time, he would raise a loud
pean to ,rye and corn, when sublimated to 'the
form of liquids .stimulant, rampant and benic-
nant to man., He does not feel equal to the task.
His ambition soars not so high.     Humbler
themes employ his modest pen. He knows
that it is a good thing for rebellion; that it is it
mild accompaniment of cotton and niggers';
that water injures it; that it foams the glorious
background of Southern' war ; that it takes
kindly to bowic-knives and pistols ; in short,
that it renders one Southern gentleman fully
equal to five Northern abolitionists. With, this
measure of knowledge, the uninspired author
subsides upon himself, and resignedly waits for
a loftier intellect to lift the laudative chorus to
an element so necessary to the existence of rman,
yet so destructive to women and children, ne-
groes and Indians.

served tie movements of his captors will live-

ing a state of inebriation, which, in its progres-
sive stages,'. was exhilar-ating, jubilant, vain-
glorious, boisterous, maudlin, and, finally, inane
and stupid.
The corporal, awaking after . three hours'
sleep, made a great bluster among his fellows,
but failed to get them in a suitable condition to
start for camp ; so that the remainder of the
day and most of the evening were spent in
abortive endeavors to rally. These lion-heart-
ed creatures had fared so badly in the service
of Jeff Davis, that they were glad of a little
freedom, and were in no hurry to return to their
bondage and corn-bread. Being interested in
but one institution in the country, and that re-
lating almost exclusively to the distillery busi-
ness, they could not be expected to display so
much alacrity in the cotton war as those who
actually owned thousands of bales of that arti-
cle.  Whatever feelings ,actuated them, they
elearlyydecided on improving present opportu-
nity, and so the whisky debauch went on with-
out serious interruption.
Frederick was faint and thirsty. One of the
Confederates, better-natured than his comrades,
held a tin cup full of the contents of the keg to
his lips; but his kindness came near being
more fatal than his cruelty, for it was of a na-
ture so hot and fiery, that the hero of this story
liked to have died under it, and barely saved
himself from strangulation by aspasmodie with-
drawing from the burning chalice. As it was,
he became very red in the face, and his throat
smarted so badly, that, as favor, he begged
the good Samaritan to take the cup away, and
give him gunpowder and water, or a mild prep-
aration of nitric acid.
Frederick was a silent yet vigilant observer
of the progress of events. He hoped an op-
portunity of escape would occur. He made
various attempts to slip the handcuffs from his
wrists, but unsuccessfully, He also made repeat-
ed endeavors to free his limbs from the cord
that kept him helpless, but with no better en-
couragement.
At night, some fuel was brought in and kin-
dled in the wide fire-place. This fire, during the
evening, lighted the room, flashing fitfully on
the uncouth amusements of the noisy revelers.
Having failed, as previously stated, to procure
poultry, some of the more adventurous of them
went farther, and fared better ; coming back
with a corpus of a juvenile swine, which was
put to roasting as soon as sufficient beat had
been produced. It was the superintendence of
the martyrdom of this porker that kept most
of them awake after their first stupor, and the
dead sleep t hat followed it.
Despite the loss of his dispatches, and the
fate that menaced him, Frederick finally grew
weary with watching and fell into a gentle
sleep. He knew not how long this lasted, but
probably it was but a brief respite from fatigue

and anxious (oreboding, for the swine was still
sweltering at the fire, and the sleepy ones sat
nodding and starting, impatient at the delhe
Assisting- in this protracted culinary procves
Frederick-beheld with surprise one who, unquve
tionably, had entered during his slumber, an,
that person was Babel. His surprise was in
stant and genuine. The agency of this gigantic
black in his escape from Camp Royal, was som'
thing he could not forget. He owed him
debt of gratitude. He had often thought
him since that night when he so unexpected;
appeared to guide him through the Confedera
guards to Peter Rust's hut. - He recalled th
fact that the man had not spoken on that occa
sion ; also his inference from the same. W
not the coming of this seamed and scarred n
gro a favorable omen? He was inclined to r
gard it as such.
He.watched Babel with awakened expec
tions ; he fluctuated between hope and fear ; i
watched his every movement. But Babel kep
at his work ; he turned the perspiring carcase
he dipped the reeking juice% from the vess
into which they trickled, and turned them upe
the blistering flesh. The white trash, sensible o
his superior skill, had fallen back, and relin
quished the momentous business entirely to hi
management.. Frederick tried to meet his-eye
but Babel appeared entirely unconscious of hi
presence. He was somewhat puzzled at thi
but did not not lose heart and hope. Thi
persecuted creature might be wiser and mo
pdtic than he seemed.  If lie had saved hi
once, had he not the same incentive to save hi
again ? There is nothing so easy as for a mat
to believe what is. agreeable to him ; and
Frederick solaced him-elf with hope..
The cooking of that Confederate pig was th
most tedious process to Frederick that he ha
over witnessed.  He wished a hundred time
that it would take fire and consume in its ow
fatness ; but nothing of the kind happened
The steaming, roasting, basting, and burnie,
were accomplished at length, and the savor
object of so much care placed on a table before
those who had been so long expecting its ad
vent. Babel then drew out of the keg, into
pail, what was left of its contents, and set it be
fore the happy subjects of the new and grea
Republic, who attacked it with as much freedo
as if they had belonged to the smallest prince
pality of the Fejee Islands.  It was a welcosel
sight to Frederick, for he was well aware ti
sleep would follow satiety and excess of dri.
The belligerents had good appetites, an
their feast was provokingly protracted. W ha
lie anticipated came to pass, with a few excep
tions. Three or four of them, instead of yield

'age, took on the wild and excited phase tha

quantities of alcoholic stimulants, and prove

not only annoying to their companions, but I
dangerous to the prisoner.
They were at first content with insulting re-
marks ; but this not being satisfactory to their
chivalry, they began to offer him personal in-
dignities, They snapped- their fingers in his
face, jostled him from side to side, pricked him
with their bayonets, and were proceeding to
more serious treatment, when Babel, who was
now, apparently, as drunk as the rest, arose
from the corner where he had been sitting, to
all appearance asleep, his- great head swaying
from side to side, and approached the scene of
these unmanly Saggressions. His eyes shot
flashes of light, and his gigantic frame quiver-
ed with excitement.- Frederick marked him
closely as he came. The scars on, his face
stood out more palpably, and he plainly read
read by the bright firelight the word "BABEL,"
charred into the shriveled flesh of his arm. He
caught the muskets from their hands and dart-
ed them  through the window; then turning
upon'the men themselves, beat them down with
his great fists. The noise of their fall, and
of the brief struggle that preceded it, awakened
the corporal from his heavy slumbers. Seeing
some of his men fall, and Babel standing over
them in flaming woath, he staggered to his feet,
and drawing his sword with much difficulty,
shouted to his fellows to' get up and defend-
themselves, for the devil or the Federals had
come.
The black, quite undismayed, sprang-to the
table, seized the wreck of the roasted porker by
the hinder legs, and swinging it over his head,
to give it momeutnm, let it fly at 'the corporal
with such force and precision, that lie was swept
from his feet as effectually as if stricken by a
cannon-ball. Babel was now master of the
field. He giatched the corporal's sword from
the floor where it had fallen, and set Freder-
ick's limbs at liberty in a moment ; then, grasp-
ing him firmly by the arm,-hurried, or rather
dragged, him from the house. Some random
and very scattering shots followed them.
" Run, Mars'r North !" said Babel.
Frederick heard this with amazement The
dumb giant had spoken ! The young man
could not refrain from exclaiming :
" You speak l I thought you were dumb and
deaf."
"At times," answered Babel, hoarsely, "I
-am mute as the' skies, and deaf as the clods we
walk on. But to-night my senses are unsealed.
I hear and I speak,"
Frederick hastened on in silent wonder. Im-
pelled by strong curiosity, he soon returned to
the subject.
" Do you, then, control the powers of speech
and hearing ?" he asked, considering, with some-
thing of awe, the grim figure at his side.
" 1 do," replied Babel, solemnly. "I say to.
my tongue, Speak not ! I say to my ears, Hear

not ! and lo! -I am deaf and dumb. No sound
reaches my soul, and no sound proceeds from
it."
" Why is this ?" inquired Frederick, his eu.
riosity still more thoroughly aroused.
- "Ask me not," 'muttered Babel, sombrely.
"The time may soon come when you shall
know. Till then, let me be Babel, the deaf
mute. When my purpose is accomplished, I
care not what 1 may be, or whether I shall have
any being in this dusky form. When my work
is done, this black-and unwieldy-frame may per-
ish for aught I care. These corporate mem-
bers may lie down with their. sears, and seams,
and unhealed wounds, to become food for the
crawling worm and the consuming mould. To
mother earth resolved-dust to dust, and ele-
ment to element surrendered ; then will enfl the
career of the man-animal, Babel. I thank the
mysterious powers of Nature that the white and
the black man are hurrying to - one common
grave."
The black spoke with stirring vehemence.
His petit-up passions, like an overpowering
tide, gushed forth without restraint.
"God is just '' answered Frederick.'
" I know nothing of the Southern Go  ", es-.
claimed Babel, fiercely, stopping suddenly, and
turning upon Frederiek as if he would read him.
" I care not to know the Deity that would op-
press my race. They are weak fools who ac-
cept the vile religion of their oppressors. It is
enough that they wring gold and pleasure from
our blood and our tears. Let them not force.
upon us a religion that teaches them how to.
whip, starve, and. break us down to the condi-
dition of cattle, whose patient necks bear the
galling yoke."     i
He paused, and swept the sky with his long
dark arm and hand.
" The God I believe in, exists in yonder star-
ry arch ;, but whether' he dwells in the moon,
or in the sun, or in fields.of light far removed
from mortal vision, I know not ; but if such a
being lives, the white and the black Saxon will
one day plead their cause together."
He stopped again, then added :
"But I have-done.' Speech is a mockery of
human expression. I shall soon abjure it, and re-
turn again to be the dumb devil I was. Betray
me not till the time comes. Talk to me ne
more at present, for we must hasten and I must
soon leave you. By-and-by, I will free you
from;those irons, andyou will be at liberty to
resume your journey to Hilton Head."
Babel went forward again like a race-horse,
and Frederick followed him silently.

CHAPTER XL..
THE REAL, BEARER OF THE DISPATCHES FOUND..
Babel halted presently, and with 'considera-
ble.hammering and 'prying, relieved Frederick
of the ironsouhis wiasts,.
"If you would go to Hilton Head," he said,
pointing with' big finger, "your way is yonder.
The Federal fleet is riding in the harbor, and
you may be, fortunate enough to pass the rebel
pickets and reach it-in safety "
1" But why should I go ?" asked Frederick.
"My dispatches are gone, and I fear my honor
is lost with-them." .
"I know nothing-of your honor, whether lost
or found," returned B  el. . "During my life-
my miserable and oppressed life-I have seen
little of the article you call honor I I have'known
Cruelty and Rage, but never honor, in the white
men that have claimed to own my flesh and my
blood, and to guide my muscles and control my

venge comes next."
The great, white rints 'of:Babel's eyes grew
yellow with wrath. ,.His broad' chest heaved
.and swelled like the waves of the sea, and Fred-
erick beheld, with something like fear, the tre-
mors of his muscular body.  "~ ...
"It is the key of my lif !" muttered .Babel,
huskily. " Revenge is the key of my life ; the
key that locked up my soul in silence ; the key
that kept me deaf, the 'key that shut me in with
my own boiling and burning passions, to wait,
with' weary and' wearing impatience,. the day

soon as the Northmen have taken Beaufort, there

the cotton-fields and rice-swamps, that will'make

lightiof the stars and the moon lay in white bil-

out as if every character clamored for attention.
"It burns at this moment, as if the smoking
irons were still eating into the flesh!" added
Babel.' " Each letter-demahnds its separate ven-
geance. 'I will give limnpain for pain, blow for

He' gnashed his, teeth 'and: his wrath. grew
startling. llolding his arm toward heaven, he
exclaimed, with thrilling effect :
"Let the God of the white man look down
on this, and witness between the two races of
men !"
North, amazed and pwed, recoiled from Ba-

bel and averted his eyes. . Immediately, Babel
turned and strode away. Knowing it would be
useless, the young man did not attempt to de-
tain him, but stood thoughtfully where the
black had left him.  ,       .
Something dropping from a tree and falling
beside ,ln made him jumpwith alarm, under
the impression that a wild animal was about to
attack him. Such a. rattling and scattering of
the leaves followed, that Frederick could not in-
stantly determine what kind of a creature had
come ; but, by-and-by, by close examination,
he was able to; separate some black feet from
the revolving' mass;.and very soon' after, the
crispy head and solemn face of Swampsey were
mutely presented to view. , His surprise was
great-; or he had given up all hopes of again
seeing the foundling of Alligator Swiamp. But
there he was, lithe and agile, and good as new.
There was manifestly as much squirm, and
twist, and leap-frog in him, as ever. He recol-
lected most of the unique names that Angeline
had called him, and could not help smiling as
he contemplated the little fellow.-
Swampsay's absence had not been unproduc-
tive of results. He reappeared to his new master
with some notable improvements in his toilet.
He had discovered, somewhere in his travels, a
pair oft honeopathie trowsers, which had-been
tenanted originally by a very small child, and
into these Swamps   ad crowded his eighteen
inches of legs, and contrived, by pulling and
tugging, to button the waistbands just above the,
hips. The general effect of these trowsers was,
to ,make the foundling's short. pilasters look like
a pair of candle-molds ; and leaving, on ae-
conat of the shortness.of the garment, a black
selvedgeextending from the ankle half-way to
the knee. When Frederick had time to take in
the full stage-effect of this costume he forgot,
in his sense of-the ludicrous, even te loss of his
dispatches.. The tow-shirt, of which mention
has been made in divers and sundry places,
japanned with dirt and glazed with faithful serv-
ice, was gracefully tucked under the trowsers,
and fell in baggy festoons over the waistbands.
"Where have you been, Swampsey ?" asked
Frederick.
" Been 'way, Mars'r Fred," replied the found-
ling, in a voice as straight on as usual.
This reply was so obviously true, that North
had nothing to say about it.
"But why did you leave me ?" continued
Frederick.
"'Cause I went off," drawled Swampsey.
This was so exceedingly. reasonable, that
Frederick.had not a word to urge against it.
" Do you know what happened after I went
tasleep^".queried North.
', Tole ye not to go 'to sleep, Mars'r Fred.
But you would go to sleep. If you'd kept your
eyes yopen, you wouldn't gone to sleep. Soger.
nmen come and took Mars'r Fred."

Seampsey tried to insinuate his hands into
the pockets of his new trowsers, which were
drawn so tightly around his little body, that it
was impossible for him to insert more than ones
finger. This, howevet,gave him ample satisfac-
tion, And lie threw a somerset on the strength
of it.
"That was. not all, my sooty gymnast," said
North. "Did you see Peter Rust sew some pa-
pe s into'the linings of my eoAt ?"
" See Mars'-r iPeter put 'em in," answered the
foundling. '"Mars'r Peter wanted 'em ear'd safe'

"Got 'em yer," said Swamps y, laying his
hand ubon the breast of his tow-shut. "Seed

A 'gleam of .indescribable triumph 'flicered
over the foundling's face.

sey, with immovable gravity. "Nobody wont

"What! you keep them ?" demanded North,
who was unprepared for this announcement.
" Why,,"'he added, with a smile, "if they.are
discovered concealed in your shirt, you will be
hanged as a spy."
" Be hung- for Mars'r Peter," said"the found-
ling. " Don't 'care what happens if they get
the papers down you."
" ou are too small to take charge of them,"
remonstrated Frederick, who was overjoyed' to
find that the dispatches were not irrecoverably
lost. , "Besides, you may lose them in some of
your ground and lofty tumhlings."
. Swampsey shook his head in solemn and ut-
ter contradiction of this possibility.
" Can't git out. Fastened in tight. Sh 'n't
go to sleep."
The closing argument of Swampsey's remarks
was one that came close home to the conscience
of the young man. He really felt confused be-
fore this odd little creature. Sleep, indeed I
It was wellithought of. - It was aptly spoken by
Svatmpscy. Frederick reflected. The lad had
displayed remarkable instincts. H1is mysteri-
ous foresight had probably saved his dispatch-
es front the 'rebels, and very probably his own
life. Why should he not trust him ?' He had
proved 'the more faithful of the two. There
were no good reasons why he should not allow
him to retain the papers ; and as he was resolv-
ed to do so, 'whether he sented or dissented,
he made a virtue of necessity, and made no
further efforts'to get possession of them.
i" Do' as you like," said Frederick. " Per,
laps your plan is the best. So far, at least,
you have exercised the utmost discretion ; And,
iti truth, youare the hero -of this undertaking.
Now, Swampsey, as I appear to be thrown upoh
yur guidance, tell me which way we shall go?
Ifydiknow of any place where we can-procure
something to eat, without being too closely
questioned,-go there as fast as you. can."  : 1
Swampsey winked a few seconds, turned slow'
lf about,"'and started off with more than usual
moderation.' Frederick followed him with great"
er faith than on the previous night; and just as
the morning rays were gilding the treetops,
came in sight-of a house, toward which 'the
fouandiih directed his steps.

Having left Ela at the house, the parties re-
turned to the shore at a point where the land
ran: farthest to the sea, in the direction of Hil-
ton Head. The' defensive works of the rebels
were plainly distinguishable. Lying off, out of
each of the guns, was the flag-ship withwhich
Frederick was so anxious to communicate.
Frederick looked at it with wishful and restless
eyes. Swampsey, the important bearer, 'of the
dispatches, sauntered about with, his hands be-
hind him,'apparently the most unconcerned of
the party. He kept remarkably to the ground,
not once revolving like a wheel, standing on his
head, spinning'round like a top, nor throwing a
single somerset, till, their guide'dragged a very
'small boat from among the shrubbery, and
laiichied it-upon the water ; then he executed
one of the most wonderful aerial baltations ever
recorded in history.: Having ventilated his
feelings in this manner, he waited with lively'
interest the development of events.. The boat-
man appeared in no hurry. His notions were
notably slow and hesitating. He looked often
towArd the Confedefe batteries.
,' We are a little  ,"'he said, apologetical-
Iy  "The moon ut     ifle too high."'
" The 'danger ni be encountered, at all
events," replied Frederick, with decision.
"This little cockle-shell -of a boat will be
blown out of the water," returned the boatman,
shaking his head dubiously. " There are plenty
of glasses 'sweeping yonder sheet' of water .to-.
night. A hundred eyes will see you before you
have passed half the distance; and a dozen ri-
fled-cannon will send their gompliments." ,
" Neither eyes, nor glasses, not rifle-shot shall
deter rne 'from discharging my duty. ' I ask no
one to attend me. I know enough'of boat-craft
to row myself to yonder ship."
"wampsey lost not a word of this discourse,
and evidently comprehendingthe exact gtate of-
affairs, threw himself into the boat with incon-
ceivable quicknesss, and seizing' one of the
ears, 'lbich were very' light, pushed from the

and gave -no more heed to the frantic cominands,
and gestures of Frederick than to the tumbling
of the spray, upon thg headland. Away he
went, dispatches and all. ,Pespite his chagrin,
the young man could not forbear smiling at the
absurdity of the situation.

"You'll never see that contraband again,"
said the boatman, shrugging his shoulders.
" You'll see a flash over yonder presently."
He leveled his finger toward the Confederate
works.  Meantime, Swampsey, perched upon
one side of the boat, plied the paddle brisky,
and the frail vessel glided over the long and
regular swells with much more velocity than
could have been expected.
The moon was high above the clouds ; its
long white beams trembled like shafts of silver
along the heaving water, and bathed with mel-
low light both fleet and battery. The same
great fountain shed equal blessings on friend
and foe. It-was a spectacle that one might see
but once in a lifetime -, the sight of a century
-ship and transport, tug and steamer, compris,
ing the great naval expedition, riding calmly at
their moorings in that magnificent harbor, al-
most' within range of the Confederate batteries.
Between the rebel works and the Federhl
fleet, tossing on the waves like an egg-shell, was
the little boat containing Swampsey and the dis-
patches,' and which, though now but a mere
speck, soon became an object of attention to
ship and shore. There was a bright flash from
one of the island-batteries, and then a booming
sound rolled-out to sea ; while, simultaneously,
a large shot went skipping from billow to billow,
finally disappearing far beyond Swampsey. But
the founding heeded not this salutation, but
continued to propel his bark with a 'steady pur-
pose. Shot after shot followed this serious ad-
monition. Rebel balls fell like hail around the
impassive little black. Frederick became pain-
fully interested. With a glass, which their
guide had brought, he kept an anxious watch of
the boat and its occupant.
" His head is gone !" he exclaimed, as Se thire-
ty-two-pound rifle-shot went shrieking in fearful
nearness to the undaunted voyager, and he sud-
denly disappeared.
"Nay, lie je up again," said Martin."He
as saved his head by dropping into the bottom
the beat."
" 1e'stands on the gunnel, dipping his paddle
as briskly as ever," exclaimed Frederick, ex.
citedly. "The foundling of Alligator Swamp

erates are firing for practice, and some of them
are very good ,range-shots. It is unmanly to

The glass passed from hand to hand, and each
expressed, by turns, his interest in Swampsey.

iak saw something, which he supposed to be his
pigmy body, drawn up over the side, and de-
posited on the deck. -
"His, mission is accomplished !" exclaimed
the young man, relieved of an unpleasant load
of suspense and responsibility..
"SAnd all for Mars'r Pieter," observed Martin.
"Had Peter of, the Pines wished those papers
conveyed to Foi-t Walker, they would have been
carried there with esal fidelity."
"He will not ooine baek, certainly," said
North, somewhat uneasily.  1
"Verily, he will return, friend Frederick,"
answered Martin. "Nothing can keep' him a,
moment longer than needful from his beloved
Peter. Look ! he goes over the side of the ship,,
and -and'now he is in his egg-shell again. He'll
come back, though a thousand hatteries roar at
him.".
Broadbent was right. Back paddled Swamp-.,

same to him. Columbiad and mortar, rifled
Armstrong and Whitworth, carronade' azd swiv-
el, ten-pounder or hundred-pounder, were of
like significance to this unique bearer of dis-
patches; and he cared not the snapping of a
thumb and finger for the whole of them.,
Perched on the gunnel, his dwarfed proportions'
were the focus of hundreds of curious and inter-
ested eyes. Both sailors and soldiers watched
his passage to and from the flag-ship, noment-
arily expecting to see boy and boat swept from
the water like a speck of sea-foam.'

TIDINGS oF MILROSE.
Although Frederick had wished to be the spe-
cial bearer of the 'dispatchs to the flag-ship,.he
was not disposed to murmur'at' what lad oc-
curred, or to envy the-laurels b Swaiipsey.
The latter celebrated -hia success by four rand
consecutive double-somersets, the first"-of the'
series being thrown with u usual sprightliness
from the bow of the boat." He infused into this
performance 'at 'least one-foundling .power-
speaking after the manner of horse-pyee sind'
dog-power, with bark-grinding and culinary re-
miniseendes in view.
On being questioned, Swam sey'was as clear
and lumiinons in 'his answers as he had been at
any time since Frederick had, been blest with
the inestimable 'treasirl of fhis'society.'
"6Why did you'play ine such a trick!" asked
Frederick, intending to bequite ste-n.'
"1Went off in the boat," answered'the hero of
Alligator Swamp, his eyes Working at the rate
of a hundred winks a minute.    'Let' Mars'r

'"'I know you did," said Frederick, biting his

lis. "It is a very sorry caper. I was very
aious to go to the flag-ship myself."s
" Mars'r Fred didn't. go," quoth Swampsey,
with the 'same truthful felicity. '
" I certainly did not," said North, who found
it difficult to feign anger which he did not feel.
'"Did you deliver the papers ?"    - '
"No, didn't d'liver 'em, Maih'r.Fred," drawl-
ed 'the' fou'dling, his eyes revolving rapidly,
and liistirongcontradiction of the idea, as he un-
deratood it, contained in the last query.
"What did you 'do with them, then1?".de-
manded Frederick, considerably startled.,
" Giv' 'em to the man with the gold things
on his shoulders.  Tole him you brung 'eni

emn honesty of look.
" Thou apeakest' beyond his comprehension,'
friend' Frederick," obse-ved Martin.  " Thou
shouldst use simple langiigp when thou confer-
est with such.""
"Wiat'did the-inan with the things  "*dis

" Ie Went down cellar I" laughed the young
man.' 'IWhat'did'he do after he went'down

"Did the commodore say. that the 'papers

idea that they were valuable.

wounds had been his particular business since'
he was fished out of Alligator, Swamp.

nothing. Gunboats and batteries were to him
of no'more importance than the tall trees of the
Pine Barrens. The biggest Columbiad ever cast
was not half so wonderful to him as Peter
Rust's double gun.
Peter and Martin took up Lovelace, and carried
him carefully to the house; while Frederick
thoughtfully followed, Swampsey making re-
mnarkably long, strides at his side, in an imita-
tive effort to keep pace with him.
CHAPTER XLVII
A GRoUP ON THE SHORE.
Early the following morning, a boat, contain-
ing three persons, touched the island. Those
three persons were : Lowenthal, Babel, and Ben
Dykes. Like hundreds of others, Lowenthal
was desirous of seeing the conflict about to take
place between the Confederate forts and the
Federal fleets ; hence his visit to the island.
The sun was just above the horizon, aild the
day promised to be unusually fine. The gun-
boats lay quietly in the harbor ; but, with his
glass, he could see-that the men were astir.

Leaving Ben Dykes to watch the boat, he
walked toward the palmetto growth attended by
Babel.  He loitered among the trees.   He
sauntered to and fro, thinking of the failure of
many of his plans,.and querying what influence
victory or defeat would exercise upon his for-
tunes. This was not a cheerful employment,
and he often listened for some premonitory gun
from ship or shore, that, in the more exciting
scene of the fight, his mind might be diverted
from personal matters far from pleasant. He
could not feel that'he had been very successful
in his aspirations ; he could not count the gains
of his intriguing life; he could not reach out
his hand and seize-the object of his ambition.
He had built many castles high in air, which he
was never to inhabit. - He sighed because he had
accomplished so little ; because his pathway had
been so crooked ; because villainy had brought
no glad fruition ; because dishonesty had been
loss, and ambition mockery, and hope delusion.
He thought of the motherless girl, her wealth,
her plantation, hey negroes, defrauded from her
by himself, and conveyed to Markthaler--the
keen, the cruel, the pitiless usurer. He knew-
how well he knew that he was in the power of
that pale-lipped man! He cherished a deadly
hatred 'for the money-lender.' He' meant to be
even with him yet, He would not be taunted
and mocked at mueh'longer. He motioned Ba-
belto him. The black giant came and stood
before him. The morning sun-rays fell very
bright and golden on the sooty face, and the
broad chest, and the bare arms of the slave.
Those arms were crossed upon his breast ; and
on one of them the cotton-planter read, with a
strange shudder:
BABEL
1860
It was singular that his eyes should fall on
'those characters just then, when he was about
to confer confidentially with his property. He
inwardly cursed the fatality and its prophecy.
How should he communicate with this mute
creature ? He thought of a way. He took out
his purse, then feigned to put glasses upon his
eyes, and imitated the gaitof Markthaler. His
dumb devil-nodded intelligibly and continuous-
ly. Lowenthal knew that the wonderful quick-
ness of the black had caught his meaning. He
drew a dagger from his breast, unsheathed it,
and holding up the purse, made passes at it with
the point. Babel nodded again as apprehen-
sively as before, and pointed, to his heart.
" Yes," said Lowenthal, momentarily forget-
ting.the deafness of his slave. " You are to kill
him ; you are to strike him dead i"
Babel raised his branded arm, and leveled it
toward a pathway near at hand. Lowenthal
looked : there stood Markthaler and Milrose.
The cotton-planter was never more amazed. lie

The two advanced-the money-lender and Mil-
rose.,                   .
" You informed me, not long since, that you
had something 0to say to this young lady. If
you were in earnest, and have not since changed
your mind, you can now speak freely."
" Not here," answered Lowenthal, quite con-
founded. "Let us walk down to the shore.
Really, I am confused. Milrose, how do you do,
child? What put you to running away? I was
infinitely pained by your distrust, my girl. But
I shall not scold you. Take my arm."
"Excuse me," said Milrose. "It is enough
if I walk near you."
They proceeded toward the shore. As soon
as they emerged from the wood, they saw the
"Wabash" moving straight on toward.Fort Walk-
er, followed in regular order by such of the gun-1
boats as were going into action.
"Milrose," said Lowenthal, sentimentally,
" This is destined to be a thrilling day. Before
the Lincoln fleet is sent to the bottom, decide-
one thing for me. The relation that has existed
between us has been but a nominal one. No
kindred blood flows in our veins. Marry me I"
Milrose stopped ; she looked steadily at Low-
enthal. The girlish form assumed a dignity
that was new to her strange -suitor. Increduli-
ty, pride, scorn, and indignation agitated her
thoughts. While she stood thus, beautiful and
silent, a thunderous roar from the flag-shipphook
the island. It was Dupont's first terrific salute.
Milrose peeled it not. The audacity of her
mother's husband engrossed all her conscious-
ness.
Markthaler placed himself where he could see
her face, the other side of Lowenthal, and made
earnest signs to her, and Jacob, who had just ar-
rived, repeated them.
" Wait a little," said Milrose,. restraining her
contempt. " There is one whom you shall con-
sult presently. If that person consents, then
you shall hear my sentiments."
Lowenthal thought he saw a glimmering of
hope ; and he was sure that he saw Frederick
North and Angeline approaching. This discov-
ery occasioned him infinite surprise ; and he
was little pleased with this addition to the party.
But other persons were hurrying to the shore,
attracted by the roar of artillery ; and he trust-
ed that he should escape attention, on account
of the thrilling and absorbing interest of the
scene in the harbor. He did not feel entirely
assured of this, however. He feared that this
obnoxious young man would come too near, and,
in some manner, cross his purposes. His first
apprehension was quite right ; for Frederick and
Angeline soon added two more to the little
group.
" Love o' God, Miss Milly! What ye down
here for ?" said Angeline. "'Pears like you run
away from the house."
'e:r c s falling upon ,Lowenithal at that in-

stant, she recoiled, in the greatest consterna-
tion.
" Laws, Miss Milly !" she added, in a sup-
pressed voice. "Tell ye what! I's cl'ar done
scared. If Peter or some on 'em don't take car'
on us, we'll be toted right back to the planta-
tion. And there's that great silent Babel and
Turpentine Ben. Wonder what he wants ?
Looks g1um enough anyways I"            -
Receiving no answer from Milrose, the girl
put her sharp eyes into use, and soon perceived
that her mistress was unusually dignified, and
that something serious had passed, or was pend-
ing, between her and Lowenthal. As for Fred-
erick, he beheld this intruder with astonishment
and secret fear. Seeing ,Milrose, his lingering
doubts concerning the identity of the person
whom he had encountered in the palmetto-walks,
on the previous night, were dispelled. Why had
she kept herself aloof, when she, unquestiona-
bly, knew that he was on the island,? Yes, it
was Milrose that he had met, and Peter,Rust
must have been in the secret of her coming.
But hecould, not understand so much secrecy.
New influences must have been brought to bear.
upon her. Something was.in progress that was
both mysterious and alarming. Would she no-
tice him now-? The question was quickly an-
swered. She turned to him with a kindly smile,
and said :
"Good-morning, Mr. North."
"Good-morning, Miss Dorn," answered Fred-
erick, bowing. " Your presence here is quite a
surprise to me."
"And my own, no less," interposed Lowen-
thal, with a frown and a menacing glance.
"And yours, no less !" repeated Frederick,
calmly.
"Truly the firing is terrific !" said a voice,
which caused the cotton-planter to start as if
he had received a blow. Looking over his shoul-
der, he saw his overseer, Martin Broadbent, who
had hastened to the shore to witness the fight.
" Verily, the earth shakes beneath us.. The
slaughter will be great."
Stand behind me, Jacob," exclaimed Mark-
thaler.
" Stand behind me, Babel," repeated the
planter, mockingly. Then, to Frederick: "You
are in time, young man, to see the Lincoln fleet
sent to the bottom of the sea. By nice calcula-
tion, based on infallible data, the Confederate
engineers at Fort Walker have arrived at the
conclusion that it wil take just twenty minutes
to sink the Yank gu".'hN

The hero, "Horace Leigh," is a fine character,
not over-drawn, and well worthy of imitation-a
fit subject "to point a moral or adorn a tale "-yet
not without his " family failings," which the au-

title of a new novel by the author of Jilt. It is a
capital story, and illustrates in the most amusing
manner-some of the peculiar phases of English
