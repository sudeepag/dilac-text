A coach, drawn by six horses, went surg- ing and creaking across Hounslow Heath, on the great Western Road to London. The traveling was bad-the eumbersome wheels moving with difficulty through a paste of black mud. Locomotion, in the reign of Charles the Second, was a matter of time; pa- tience, and equine strength-all the highways of England being in execrable condition. Ruggedness and quagmires were not the only inconveniences of the road: robberies were frequent, and of an aggravating charac- ter. Contributions were levied on both sim- ple and gentle, with an imperativeness that admitted of no hesitation or compromise. These outrages upon justice and individual rights were sometimes perpetrated under circumnstances so singular, that they set the whole co6ntry agape with wonder and admi- ration. There was a mania for cutting purses and clapping pistols at people's heads. The postillion whipped and cursed; the coachman whipped and cursed; tie footman shouted and cursed,; while the poor beasts tugged dutifully at their task. The vehicle was one of new invention, called the flying- coach; but never was the figure. of flying more unfortunately applied. There were three persons in the carriage --Lady Castlemaine, Mrs. Haselrigge, and Sir Henry Bennet, Secretary of State. To the student of history, these names will at once suggest a volume of reminiscences, their lives being intimate ly associated with a ro- mantle and interesting epoch. The first faint. and -shadowy haze of twi- light was descending softly on the heath. The hour and the road were' both suggestive of the dangers'of the period; and the con- versation of the parties in the coach naturally fell upon footpads, outpurses, and highway- men. As is usually the ease, in such situ- ations, wit those who wish their courage to stand high in the estimation of fair ladies,   Sir Henry professed himself 'quite at ease, laughed at the tales recited to him by uis gentle companions, and protested that no- thing would better accord with his present humor than an adventure with the most au- dacious infester of the roads. Being well armed, he declared it would be the best sport in the world to shoot two or three of the rogues, and put the rest to flight with his sword. The coach stopped; the postillion, coach- man, and footman became suddenly silent; the horses ceased to tug and strain, while the heavy top no longer rocked from side to side. There was a fluttering within. Expectation was rife, Sir Henry sneezed, and the ladies looked at him with eager, inquiring faces. During the few seconds of suspense that fol- lowed, not: a word was spoken, Anon the clumsy door was opened without haste, care- fully, deliberately. The ladies shrieked; Sir Henry grew a trifle pale about the mouth, and sat motionless on his seat. They saw a tall, dark figure, and what was of far more con- sequence, two pistols. ot the large calibre and size of those carried by horsemen in holsters at that day. The sight of these weapons had an effect on Sir Henry wonderfully tranquilizing; he stared at them in dull inaction, forgetful, apparently, that he was a moment since spe- cially anxious for an interruption of this kind. "Alms! alms! For the sake of Our Lady, alms!" The voice of the applicant was bland and courteous. Mrs. Hasclrigge began to recover courage. She fixed her handsome eyes on the bold mendicant. The increasing twilight prevent- ed her taking particular note of his apparel; but that he was of goodly stature and of a shapely person, she was at once assured. Her inquisitive gaize naturally sought his face, but his height raised it above the low door. Of this deprivation, however, she had not long reason to complain, for he immedi- ately stooped,-and brought his head on a level   with her own. Instead of seeing the threat- ening visage of a highwayman, she beheld a blacE and white mask-'black on one side from the forehead to the chin, white on the other.' Lady Castlemaine could not. refrain from expressing her terror by trembling and wring- ing her hands. She had heard of the robber of the black and white mask, and his startling appedrinee seemed to. her active imnagination the harbinger of all that was dreadful. "You give yourself unnecessary trouble," added the intruder, in a tone a shade less courtly. "Your ladyship's life is in no im- mediate danger. You would gain time and deport much more sensibly by searching your person for the alms for which fI' humbly sue, than by these silly perturbations and attitudes of aelbir."  "Wiho are you," demanded Sir Henry, faint- , 1'"that dare make these bold requests? Know you not that wie belong-to the king's bhosehold?".  "In answer to the first, Sir Henry, I would say that I am he of the WHTz AND BLACK. To the second, I reply, that I know you well; and it gives me the liveliest pleasure to meet you in this solitary place. Speak not of the king's household. Wrreyou Charles himself, yen should not pass over this moor without paying ing tribute." He carelessly turned, the mtlzzle of one of his pistols' toward Sir Henry, whose fears were gradually -subsiding. ," I have little leisure and less disposition," added the, mask, "to protract a  scene like this; Deliver, and at once; the four hundred pounds; which youn to-day collected for the 1 king. together with certain letters which yon 1 ingeniously intercepted, and in consideration 1 of yonr high office, you may keep that valu-  able diamond ttat I -see sparkling on your I finger. It slall never be said that he of the ] Black and White was not generous." "Where- are my'rogues?" groaned Sir I Henry. "By   my sonul! I believe the three 1 varlers are in league with this rascal!" s '"Pardon me, my lord 1" answered the rob- t ber, -most politely. " Abont three minutes ago, I  saw your postillion, coachman, and I fLotman, running across the heath at a very I good pace."               o -"I'll have 'em  hanged " muttered Sir 1 Henry, reluctanily drawing a bag from be- i neath the cushions, and' handing it to the mask, who nccepted the gift-byr a graceful in- v clination of the'ody.   -  1A Tlhe letters!" said the resolute beggar, in E a  firm voice.             e "Nay, most obliging sir," stammered his h lordship, " you must be misinformed respect- B ing the letteirs."           a "If you have ever had the happiness to o   i- hear of him of the Black and White," said! a the mask, in :a low, imperious tone, ," you :, must be aware that he never holds long con- e versations with his benefactors. lMy lord, if you value life, surrender those letters on the a instant 1" -  "Sir Henry," cried Mrs. Haselrigge, "I r implore you to consider your safety!" ; With a murmured imprecation, thb seere- 1 tary drew a small pacwkagefrom his doublet, and gave it with trembling hand to the rob- ' ber, who placed it in his bosom with more s haste than he had yet displayed. ' "Thanks, Sir Secretary! I shall long re- 1 member your goodness.' He turned to Lady Castlemaine and Mrs. Haselrigge. "Fair ladies, ifyour contributions be equal to your charnms, I shall be more than satis. ? He extended a gloved hand, and they placed in it their purses, which, unfortunate. ly for the despoiler, rere not heavily freight- ed. You have a small picture of the king, in a diamond stting," said he of the Biack and White, addressing Lady Castlemaine. a"The diamonds are small," stammered the lady. "You can better spare them than if they were larger. , Your loss will be less for their smallness," returned the xnask. With- a sigh of 'regret, she drew the min- iature from its warm resting-place, and sur- rendered it to the polite but pitiless alms.- takeri. . "4 Gentle ladies," he said, "I might drive a harder bargain with you, but I have respect to. your sex, as well as -for charms which ,have power to dazzle the eyes of Charles Stuart, of England, and the Duke of Mon- mouth."  When he mentioned the name of Monmouth, he bowed to Mrs. Haselrigge. "Courteous robber, of the White and Black," said the latter, "I trust you will not leave us without a name by which we may sometimes recall the memory of the hero of \ this adventure?" "Fair madam,'replied the mask, in a voice peculiarly insinuating, "I will leave, as my parting gif%, th e name of NIoaTSADE.'"He stood silent a moment, then bowing profound- ,dded: d        o Nightca of the mite ad Black.", He closed the door of the coach, and-a moment later the. heard him calling in a loud voice to the postillion and coachman to drive Sir:Henry Bentiet to London. Calling them cowardly and loitering rogues, he mounted a large white horse that had stood quietly be- side him during the robbery, and galloped away., The trained animal stobod an instant on its hinder legs, on feeling its master's   weight in the saddle, then launched on its oourse, making the earth shake with its heavy bounds. Tile secretary, who had by this time laid hands on a pistol, fired it after the receding highwayman, with no other effect than to shiver a pane of glass and frighten the horses, which, left to themselves, fell to rearing and plunging in a  alarming manner. They dragged the ponderous vehicle a short dis- tance with dangerous speed, when it was over- turned, And stuck fast, in the mud. 'The horses leaped and strained at the dead, un- Wieldly weight, but, fortunately for those im- prisoned in the coach, could not start it. Here was a dilemma not only embarrassing but. critical. There was no way of escape from the vehicle. Tile secretary found him- self half-stifled under a pile of cushions, while his cries for assistance were so hearty and persistent, that the ladies, though great- ly disturbed and in a most uncomfortable position, could scarcely forbear laughing. Matters were serious enough; the terrified animals kicking and floundering, the coach quivering and groaning in every joint, and the utter hopelessness of extrication, render- ed the accident one of a trying and fearful nsa ture. It was in vain that Sir Henry tried to get upon his feet and groped for the fasten- ings of the door; he could neither get out by his own exertions, nor bring back his attend- ants by his shouts.. He seriously thought that his final hour had arrived, and .the la- dies were commending themselves to saintly protection, when most welcome sounds reach- ed their ears. They heard the clatter of horses' feet, and. before five minutes had elapsed, were surrounded by men on horse- back. An' authoritative voice gave hurried orders. The coach was instantly seized and righted. The, frantic horses were held by strong handsi while the vehicle was drawn forward to safer ground. "This is as it should bWe," added he who had directed these movements.; "Three or four of you ride after those craven rasecals who have shamefully deserted their trust." The secretary tried to lookout to see who were his deliverers, but the glass was so cov- ered with mud, that he could discover but in- distinct figures moving about sdr standing at restf "Who is it that gives these orders?"' asked Mrs. Haselrigge, whose curiosity, was much awakened, "Is there not something familiar in his voice, .Sir Henry?" 'No!'.' answered the secretary, who was now in a most unamiable temper. "I notice nothing  peculiar in it. It is some honest burgher, I dare say, returning to his shop and his wares; or. a drover, perchance, with   a company of his fellows. If we get out of tifs hobble in safety, I shall care little to whom we owe the'favor." Presently the horsemen came back with the runaways, who had secreted themselves behind a hedge. The postillion was placed on his horse, the coachman on his box, tie footman on his board, with more precipitas tion than ceremony. This operation was su- perintended by a stout fellow, who, so tar as those in the coach could judge, had great satisfaction in the employment, giving each a shake and a parting admonition as he adjust. ed him in his appropriate position. "This adwice hear!" he said, in conclu- sion. "Never drop whip and rein when a honest gentleman of the road. finds it con- wenient. to stop the wehicle and speak a word to your betters. Listen, ye warmints! Give ear, likewise t / Observe, also Did .ye ever know a wulgar postillion to be robbed, or a coachman, moreover, or a footman, notwith- standin' Adwance, ye willains!" "What did I tell you?" grumbled the sec- retary.. "A company. of drovers " "Sir Henry," said a voice at the broken pane, " be more discreet with your fire-arms. t take it ill of vou, upon my word, that you. should expose these fair ladies to such peril, Had anything unfortunate happened to Lady Castlemaine, the king would not only havoe degraded you from your high office, but cast you into the lowest dungeon of the tower. And a's for Lady Haselrigg, it is reported that his grace, the Duke ofMonmouth, has, an interest in her,-being bewitched',by her exceeding beauty." "It is-Nightshade!" murmured Mrs, Hasel- rlgge, in a singular flutter of doubt and ap- prehension. "A matchless medley of courtesy and im- pudence l" muttered the secretary. "Be careful of yourself,. Sir Henry, and give my dutiful services to the king. Tillwe meet again, farewelll" - Lady Castlemaine, looking through the shivered pane, saw him of the- Black and White bend in the saddle till his hair mingled with his horse's mane, and ride away at an easy canter. In a moment they- were alone on the heath. The whips cracked, the horsed tugged, and the wheels rolled slowl y over the ground.  "The pink of gallantry " sighed Mrs. Haselrigge.. ". Pardon me, madam,?' answered Sir Hen- ry, biting his lips, "if I choose to roegard him, as the most mendacious of. knaves. I hope I shall live to see him adorn Ty-burn tree! This Nightshade of the Black and White is the identical fellow who ha, given so much trouble ti the athorities.'. His robberiesa have been of a bold and startling ,character.,   He is very much talked of at London. The mystery of his; movements, and the manner in which he baffles pursuit, are themes on which all the gossips of the country are elo- quent. Faithi it wouldn't be strange if the ]king and half his court were to take to the highway in quest of adventures. The secret of his power is unknown; but some of his robberies point to a higher game than paltry pounds, shillings, and pence. He has this night rifled me of a correspondence that I would not have parted with for the whole county of Middlesex." "His hand was small and shapely," ob- served Lady Castlemaine, whose admiration of Nightshade was perceptibly heightened by the remarks of Sir Henry. "Bah!" sneered the latter. "I have no patience with such sickly sentiment. Lose what I have lost,.and you'll think more of his neck than his hand." The evening was considerably advanced, but the moon lent a soft and misty light to quide the travelers on their way. The coach labored onward. The road was now much better, although the wheels still sank in the yielding soil. They were making good pro-, gress, when they were again made anxious by i a sudden interruption of motion. Posslbill- I ties of-another call for alms excited their im- i aginations. "'What now?" roared Sir Henry.  "Are 3 we to be robbed again." The footman leaped from  his place, and opened the door.             i "A   curious sight, your lordship! Will i your lordship and the ladies please to look?" i The parties turned their eyes to the point i indicated, and saw a horse approaching at a t brisk pace, ridden in a most novel fashion. The 1 rider was a man advanced in life, seated with v his face to the animal's tail, his legs tied be- 1 neath its flanks, and his arms pinioned be- t hind him.  His hat and wig were gone, and f the few long, gray hairs that remained on his I head, floated in the wind. The motions of a his beast, which was a spirited one, together ti with his own exertions to free himself, swayed I and tossed him about in a grotesque manner. Sir Henry and the ladies fell to laughing, o while the footman stopped the horse.   t " I know the old curmudgeon," said the h secretary. "It is Got Moneypenny, the mi- to ser; the most penurious wretch in the king- ti dom."                  t "For the love of God," groaned the old tl wlan, with dismal contortions, "pursue the ol villain and recover my bag of gold!"  fl "Better untie you, I  think," replied' Sir at Henry, mueh amused.           m "  Yes, it would be well to untie me. Oh, flu my   gold I my gold I I have come to pov- si erty m  my old age. I shall die in Bridewell." -e   e I The miser's grimaces and lamentations were r irresistibly ludicrous. The postillioa and a coachman joined in the general merriment. ' "Cease your bawling!"' cried Sir Henry. e "I will wager a -hundred pounds that vou e have more money in your strong-box tLhn t the king has in his treasury." s  "Heaven reward those that laugh dt my y calamity, and mock when my fear cometh!" 8 repiped Moneypenny. - Will no one have i pity? Will no one mount and pursue? He , wore a black and white mask, rides a white horse, and said'he would sleep in London to-night. If I were the king, or the lord mayor, I would purge Middlesex of such ver- min, I'll warrant. My gold-my precious, yellow goldl I'll give two pounds to any one who'll bring back my gold." "Such liberality will ruin you!" laughed Sir Henry. "Man, man, one pound is enough for the restoration of fifty." No one had made a movement to untie the unhappy Moneypenny, who, in the loss of his treasure, was well-nigh unconscious of his un- comfortable and ridiculous situation. "If they had wounded- me," he went on i , " if they had left me with a broken head,or a broken limb, or a crushed rib, I should have been content. But fifty, fifty pounds-- fifty pounds in yellow ore f Full weight- down weight  Will nobody ride?   I care not for your mockings and your. mirth, if ye'll but ride and restore me my own." This scene took place nearly opposite an inn ; and while the miser was making his com- plaint and pouring out his misery, n half- dozen court gallants rode from the door to the spot.' Tothese gay and light-hearted gen- tlemen, Got Moneypenny soon made known his grievance; while Sir Henry, in fewer words, related  his own  mishaps. These hilarious lords were in mood and condition to attempt the capture of a   character so famous and successful as Nightshade, of the Black and White. After a   volley of gibes and jests at .the miser, they put spurs to their steeds, and galloped off on the road to London. As luck would have it, they had not ridden over half a mile, when they descried, about twenty rods in advance, a man riding a white horse, who allowed them to lessen the dis- tnance at least one-half, before giving indica- tions that he was awane of pursuit; then, turning an instant in his saddle, as if to scan the speed and strength of those behind, set off at a rate calculated to test the best horse- flesh in England. The white steed, flying across the heath through the shimmering moonlight, looked like a shooting-star. It flew on, and on, till it was a mere speck of silver on the plain, then vanished like the evanescent gleam of a fire-fly.   The pursuers, now scattered along the road, swept forward with unabated ardor. Their asimals, -which were of choice breeds and tried mettle, put their willing muscles to the work, and devoured the ground with tremen- dous bounds. The foremost of the pursuers were confident Nightshade could not escape, although their assurance received 'a severe shoclk when he disappeared in the distant dimness. ; Presently they met a man driving a pack- mule.  "Have yout seen a man on a white horse, my good fellow!" asked the leading; gallant; slacking his speed. "No, your honor," replied the country- man, " but there be a man on a great red horse, just ayont here." "-Was he going fast?" "He be goin', your worship, as if the devil be at his heels!" The interrogator resumed his headlong course. The countryman gazed after him and his hurrying companions, muttering: "When ye take the flying highwayman, ye'll do btter than ye ha'e done yet." The pursuers swept over two miles of. level road with the speed of the wind. Those in advance at the' start were now in the rear, urg. ing their steaming beasts with spur and voice. It was a helter-skelter race; boisterous, yet earnest; noisy, yet persistent; disorderly, yet dangerous. People ran from every way- side inn to see them swoop by, some sending after. them -words of encouragement, others laughter and jeers.  A cavalier, mounted on a'strong iron-gray, now led by a considerable distance the reck- less riders. -This gray proved swift of foot, agile, of limb, and of great endurance. Its noble and generous blood was heated, and it ran with an eagerness scarcely equaled by its fearless'rider." They had reached a more un- even tract of country. On turning an abrupt winding of the road, the man on the gray eaught sight of the chase. But he held him in view a moment only, though long enough to perceive that he was mounted on a power- ful red horse. It was in vain that he pricked and cheered; he could not obtain a second view of the robber of the White and Black. Leaning low in his saddle, he pushed forward With unabated vigor. Within a mile of Lon- don, he overtook a man on foot. "Has 's man passed you, riding a red horse?" ". No, your lordship; but a fellow dashed by me, not five minutes ago, on a mighty black." The pursuer sped on. The pedestrian shook his fist after him, and muttered: "Peradventure you will; peradventure you won't." s         *    "A white, a red, and a blaek l" said he on the iron-gray to himself. "I wonder what next?" Huts, hamlets, and inns, went rushing past him. The earth seemed to revolve with as- tonishing velocity beneath the hoofs of his noble steed. .He was entering London, when, for the third time, he espied the object of his frantic haste. ; Nightshade no longer seemed in a  hurry; he turned in his saddle, made a gesture of adieu to his pursuers, and then his great horse shot forwarad, over London Bridge with a fleetness that was wonderful; and, a moment after, disappeared mysteriously near the Tower. CHAPTER II. THE BARLEY MOW. During the reign of Charles the Second, Bartemas Gurther kept the Inn of the Barley Mow, at Hounslow Heath, ten miles from London. The hostel of. the Barley Mow was known far and Sear for the foam of its ale, the flavor of its sack, the atundance of its cheer, and, in-brief, for the comforts it afforded to hungry man and jaded beast. On a foggy afternoon, in the tap-room of this inn, sat two men, over two bottles of sack, smoking two pipes. One of these persons had loig legs, long arms, a long neck, a long nose, long hair, and was called Kyte Link- horn. He was lean and lathy, as if-he had been flattened between two rollers, and came out very meek and subdued. He was ajour neyman watchmaker, -from the Three Dials, Clerkenwell, London. His companion had short legs, short arms, a short neck, a short nose, short hair, and was short of clothes. His name was Lack Billson.  He Was stout and stumpy, and seem- ed to have been -thickened in a fulling-mill, coming out very red, jolly, and bristling. These men had met by accident-ifacei- dents ever happen in this mutable world-and were putting out their mental feelers to get hold of each other. "My father," said Mr. Billson, in- answer to a corkscrew question, "was a wagrunt, and my mother was a wagrunt; and I," he added, tapping his breast, " am likewise a wagrunt. It's a singular dewelopment; for my ancestors, a hundred year back'ards, was doeks, every one of 'em., :"; The movements got out o' order, I spose?" said Mr. Linkhorn, suggestively, speaking after the manner of his trade. ".They did git out o' order," answered Lack Billson, impressively. "Good many on 'em was convicted. o' high treason, and their 'eads cotehed in a basket at the Tower. It's werry awful to have your 'ead cotched in a basket i"   -Mit, Billo0. puffed t O-b6th cheeekb,til1his quat aose wasinearly o Kin he m.

Possibly the entrance of Bartemas Gutlher, who. had & strong dishke. to .his class; hqastened his- departure. The worthy innkeeper had a   goddly bulk of body,. a   ruby .face, a,- loud voee; a :strong will, a helpful, elpmate, and a. pretty daughter- whose name was Margaret--a   saucy-ipped,. blsck-eyed, b]aok-hair,  1 girli whom a, man could be forgiven for loviug. .Many ancient bottles were called for at the Barley Mow, in the secret hope that they would be brought   by the fair hands of the innkeeper's daugh- ter.   1 There came in with Gurtner a young man, to whom he was addressing some animated remarks. "Got to be robbed, haven't we? Can't step out doors, can we, without seeing pistols, arquebusses, and daggers! Our purses must be inquired for every day by this fellow who rides a red horse, a black horse, and a white horse, and is everywhere at the same time." Gurther threw himself upon a wooden settle, and took breath. "I ask you, Christy Kirk, what's to come of all- this " -  "I suppose the king will put a stop to it," answered Christy, modestly. "ThIen why don't he putt a stop to it?" in- -sisted the inn-keeper, with considerable heat. ' If a man can't keep what he's got," he ad- ded, " what's the use of settlin' down and try- in' to 'cumulate? I put that question to you, Christy Kirk, and to you, Kyte Linkhorn; and I'd put it to Charles himself, if he was here." ': And very properly, too," said Christy, who, having been wounded by the bright eyes of Margaret, was naturally desirous to stand high in the estimation of her father. "If a man," continued Gurther, in the same convincing strain of argument, " can't settle down and 'cumulate, he becomes a rollin' stone and gathers no moss; which is anony- mous to not settiin' down and not 'cumulatin'." i"That's wot I calls a clincher!" said Kyte Linkhorn. "Master Mailers would call that a clincher, too." "To settle down," pursued Gurther, "is the main business o' life.' Arter that comes the gatherin' in of the wherewithal to make you comfortable agin a rainy day, as well as to give your darter (pervidin' you have a dar- ter) a lift when she gets ready to settle down and 'cumulate." Christy Kirk blushed at this allusion, for he hoped to be the happy one-to "settle down " with Margaret Gurther. "I wish there was more here," said .Link- horn. "I likes argyment, 'specially when things comes on, one aftcr -the otheir, as though they was framed in from the beginnin' by a mind as could see clear through." The innkeeper acknowledged this tribute to his perspicacity with a slight winking and blinking of the eyes, but without permitting himself to be diverted from the question of ' settlin' down." "If I was to - advise a young .person, I'd say: "Become stationary. Don't wander; don't be a rollin' stone. I have a rollin' stone in my eye.' Kyte Linkhorn looked up as if he expected to see him take it-out of his eye.   "Thel rollin' stone I have in my eye is, Moll Poo!" "Life of my body!" muttered Linkhorn. "She which I alludes to," added Gurther, "is a baggage as unsexes herself and flouts about the Country a horseback and afoot; here to-day, at Lunnon to-morrow, in the clothes inwented for masculine wear. As for the matter o' character, I sfan't care to look arter the same. That she 'easional:y oute a purse, I wouldn't for a certainty herein set forth." "Ain't she a honest 'un?"s asked Kyte. "How should I know whether she's a hon- est 'un? Be I a man to find out whether women is hon st 'uns. H a'n't I enough to do to keep a honest inn without troubTin' my- self about the honesty of females? But to return to the argymevnt: It would be an ad vantage to the public morals if this she, in doublet and hose, was sent to Bridewell." Bartemas, Gurther stopped with an abrupt- ness that indicated the sudden presence of an obstruction. The door was pushed open, and the figure that presented, afforded an explau nation of the stoppage of *his discourse. He grew a trifle redder in the face, and itwas not without a slight quackling in the throat that he said: 1 Enter, Mary Glasspool I This hostel is for the entertainment of such as comes." "Rogue  It is barely two seconds since you sent me-to Bridewell I Wliat- a mighaty difference between presence and absenee ' said the intruder, advancing into the middle of the room. "Truly, Mistress Moll," replied the inn- keeper, producing a handkerchief a trifle red- der than his face, and blowing his nose like a fish-horn, "we sometimes give the tongue license in the absence of friends, without meanin' 'em a injury. I can',t make the old proverb lie for anybody. Listeners is them that never has and never will hear any good of theirselves. Under that give notices." "You beer-bloat! You sack-sponge 1" re-, torted Moll, shaking a little riding-whip warn- *ingly at Gurther. "Wot a female development I Wot a roar- ing girl lP exclaimed the watchmaker, with' dilated eyes. 'The unique personage answering to the name of Moll Pool, turned and gave Linkhorn a playful cut across the shoulders. ; "Wot astunnin' movcrent she's got I Thre" f a main spring for ye! And there's a dial, too, that beats some I've set agoin'." Mary Glasspool was a prodigy of womankind. ; She did not always wear the prescribed attire e of her sex, but by a bold raid on established usage, now and thenin erratic moods, crept into I doublet and hose. The doublet of silver tissue swept down to the waist, with sleeves reaohing   a little below the elbow, after the style of the period, the remainder of the arm being. cov- ered with the white linen shirt-sleeve, puffed, apnd ending in ruffles at the wrist. Over her shoulders- she wore, with dashing grace, a short blue-velvet cloak, trimmed with gold lace. Her cap was ofblue plush, with a long feather drooping low from the left side. The trunk-hose were af the same material .Ui the cloak, pufled at the knees like bladders., The stockBngs were of,silk; the boots short, with broad tops of russet leather. Her periwig was in the prevailing mode, and fell in banks of curls over her. back .and!shoulders.; To complete her costume, a sauuyisword dangled, at her side, supported by a rich belt. With her ruffs and puffs, her gold and feathers, boots and spurs, peruke and sword, Moll Pool made a very notable figure. To these particulars must be added: an una- bashed and piquant countenanee; i quirk and shrewd pair of eyes a voice round, clear, and resonant; a tongue tlat could readily whip up every word ot the English language, and a wit to send them sharply home like .arrows  together with an easy, fashionable, dareto deportment that mad- her at home in all places, and a figure so large and well-devel- oped that he would have a high opinion of his own strength who dnared provoke her ire. To sum up, she looked and aoted the gay and slashing -'gallant, wanting neither the Impu-  dence nor ability of that character. It would i be injustiee to this unsexed mailen not to ad- 1 mit that she had more than an average claim i to personal comeliness-her teeth being white as a bank of snow, her lips aglow with health,  and- lher expression not only vivacious but  dangerously coquettish when the -winning mood was on her.

Ruby at. h tended by Kyte Linkhorn, had trotted down ig to. Houslow, on a fying visit, as she was -in mk , the habit of doing half-a-dozen times a year. oo She was of the same .ge as Margaret, a trifle d,j taller, and gifted with that inheritance so h perilous to woman--beauty.

Ruby and Margaret, standing with unstud- lied grace in the door, formed a charming pic. p ture.  Christy Kirk thought. he had never a seen a sight so. pretty. Seeing her thus ; yoked with her fair cousin, gave him, he knew D not why, an  additional pleasure. Had not I the curiosity of the maidens been awakened by such a nine-days' wonder as Mary Glass- i pool, they would not have been true to. the in ) stincts of Mother Eve.  . I    "Look at- me, my pretty dears!" cried Moll, throwing out her arms, and whirling Islowly on the pivot of her rightheel. "I was  made to be looked at. Take your fill, my "At your wild, unwomanly pranks again, Mary GIasspool," said Ruby, smiling, in spite of her wish to be grave. "Had   you ever a  gallant, my blushing maid?', answered Moll, pinching the girl's cheeks. '"I'll warrant you were never wooed halfso fine as I can woo you in -my doublet and   hose; for, look you, daughter of the watchmaker, not one of the he-rogues is half so handsome as I.

Glasspool ceased her mimicries - as abruptly as Giurther had bridled his tongue a few. moments before. The girls, looking behind them, beheld, to their confusion, two gentlemen, who had entered the wide hall of the hostel unheard, and unobserved. The taller of the two was dressed in cloth of black velvet, with high top-boots, a black beaver,. with a flaxen peruke nearly covering his brows as well as a portion of his side-face. His comr. plexion was noticeably sallow; while a  sin- gular scar on-the left cheek, gave an exprs-   Aion to his countenance that one could not easily forget. His eyes were bold and search- ing;-, his manner;ashered, though neither rude nor pretentious. ' His- companion' Was clad in, gray, even to the ap and featheir while his features were as fair as the othS were sallow. His- atten- tion was cohtintnaly fixed on himO af'the sear, to whom he manifestly paid mniute defrence. Both wore the heay :ewords of the period. Theinstant th'gad of the the calier in black rested on the face of Ruby, the gravity which hfi features had wor n  in repose, gave place to surprise and pleasure. The quick gleam that swept over his visage, half dispelled its balliowness. :^  "Come!" said Ruby, gently drawing her 'cousin from the room. "We are in the way of Tour father's -guests." f In the way? By the seeptre of the king, not The stars of heaven are as much, in tile way of the traveler, of a dark night!!" ex- claimed the cavalier in black. Christy Kirk started to his feet, and looked menacingly at the smiling and bowinggallant, who, while the maidens stood irresolute, placed himself before them, cutting off their retreat. "Mine host," headded, with a gesture thee most debonair," let not these damsels defraud us of their fair company. Faith! it is a wel- come sight to see such faces on this accursed heath, and the sin lies in hiding them .in the dingy nooks and crannies of a rural inn." "Yol of the Barley Mow," interposed he in gray,r " we would fain try the flavor of your most ancient vintage; and, prithee, let it be served by these dainty maidens." "One of these," -answered Gurther, with visible pride, "is my darter Margaret;, the other, my niece Rmuby; and therefore, your honors, maidens of simple degree, though, 1 thank God, as virtuous and modest girs as any in the land." *' I doubt it not, worthy host," replied he of the sear. "4 Your worships are welcome to the Barley Mow; and you shall have'the wine, and my Meg shall serve it, if it be your pleasures."' , "Thanks, obligingGurthbr!

A dark aiid severe expression ap- peared on the face of the cavealier in black, while Shillinglaw elevated his brows and shoulders simultanteously. 4"There is not a more loyal heart in Eng- Iand than my uncle's," said Ruby, instinct- ively perceiving that her kinsman was tread- inig periloiis ground. it leads have been whipped off for words less offensive than those," remarked the man in gray.

But Charles is a sweet king, nevertheless. There will never be aneother such king as Charles I I shall throw myself into the Themes when he dies l" Shillinglaw burst into a loud laugh, in which Dare Outlook joined. By this time the wine was brought, and placed'on the table in the tap-room, though Grrther was anxious to serve it in his best apartment; to which Outlook had silently ob- jeoted by an authoritative motionlof the hand. Ruby had remained, and listened to' this- conversation with a wondering interest, in- duced by its extreme novelty. Not unwil- ling to hear more, and inwardly pleased' with the newness of the employment, she smiling- ly filled the glass that Cutlook caught from the table and held toward her; while Meg, with less embarrassment, rendered the same service to Shillinglaw. The new guests being seated, Cutlook fixed his regards on the auda- eious Glasspool, and said: "Will you deign to drink a glass with us, Sir Page Y Methitks you should forget dis-  tinetions with two' lionest soldiers who hh ve been in battles, and 'received honorable wounds." "To oblige you, good cavaliers," answered Moll, accepting the glass, and placing herself vis-a-vis with him of the soar. "' Might I ask your name, gentle youth?"\ added Outlook. "Edward Starling,"  replied Glasspool, daintily. "s And a starling that has learned well the use of his tongue," remarked Shillinglaw. a Having given us your views of the king,' tell us what. you think of those about him- the Earl of Arlington, for instance." "God mind Charles Berkeley, the Earl of 'Arlington!" ans vered Moll, by no means em- barrassed. '"He is poor company for so sweet a king. There is not s6 lickerish a fel- low in the whole courtl  He puts wicked things in Charles' head, I can tellyou! It is not long since  he offered three hundred pounds to the surgeon's wife, to get her hus- band a pair of borns." "Heaven have mercy on peers of the realm!" exclaimed Gurther. Dare Cutlook rubbed his hiands with infi-   nite relish, and ogled his companion, whose countenance had suddenly. grown dark. This is sa -rare page!" he muttered, glanc- ing at Cutlock. Then to Moll: "Good youth, give your tongue less license, in the name of the pillory and the cart-tail. It is not discreet to slander the king and his household. 'You are safe with us; but I advise -you as a friend, not to repeat the story of that pernicious jade, Mary Glasspool, and the surgeon's wife." "Enough of this!" said Cutlook, with the air of one wont to be obeyed. "Fair dam. sel, another glass. Never was I served so royally before. Mine host, you should be proud of your niece and daughter." "Ay, marry, am I!" said Gurther, who had an eye to the thrift of- his inn. Shillinglaw, exhilarated by the generous vi'tage, caught Margaret by the arm, and whispered in her ear. Christy Kirk immedi- ately advanced, and indignantly freed her from his grasp, threatening him with a blow for his insolence. Upon this, the man sprang from his seat, inflamed with anger, and had drawn his sword from its sheath to revenge the interference, when Dare Cutlook laughingly bade him de- sist. "You must take life as it comes, good Or- loff," said he. '"The greatest victories have not been achieved in a moment. Patience! patience! Let there be no brawls at the Bar- rey Mow." Christy, meantime, drew his hanger, and stood on the defensive. f "Margaret," quoth he, "is not to be in- sulted by every lascivious gallant that comes along. If you wish to play at the sport of cut and thrust, you won't find me a whit be- hind you in good will." "Peace, clodhopper, replied Shillinglaw, contemptuously. "Your presumption will meet its reward soon enough." "Put up your sword, Christy i" vociferated Gurther. "I'll have no veins opened in my inn. Think you I can't take care of Meg . Is the wench a fool, that I should go for to worry myself?" Christy sheathed his hanger sullenly. "You cannot take care of her," he mut. tered ; " and Margaret, though no fool, knows not the dander to which she is exposed." "I haven t kept a inn for nothing V per. sisted Gurther, obstinately. "Boldly herein I set it forth!" "Let us go!" said Ruby, trembling with alarm. "Yes, go at once," whispered Christy to Margaret. "These cavaliers mean you no good. They are hero to deceive you with their Wiles.' Cutlook arose, and carelessly placed him- self near the watchmaker's daughter.   "Do not fear," he said, in a low voice. 4 "I must see you again." "No 1 no l'" returned Ruby, hurriedly. i "You and I, sir, ought not to meet. There -is treachery and deceit in your eyes., I feel like one in peril." "Trust not, sweet maiden, the whispers of fancy. If I read the stars aright, there is a destiny before you." "You cannot mislead me, my lord, or what- ever or whoever you are. Remember that I live in London, with the hum, and bustle, and  scandal of the great and powerful about me. Think you one can dwell within the sound of ,Bow-bells, and. not learn something. of the ways of the rich and titled? Believe me, sir, I am not one of those you seek. I take it ill that you should presume so much upon my humble condition. There is something I value above smiles and flatteries, worldly honors and gifts." Ruby turned from  Cutlock with flushed cheeks, and, taking Margaret by the hand, left the room.  '"Beautiful and modest!" murmured Cut- lock. "She will repay pursuit." "Now," said Christv Kirk to Shillinglaw, as they are gone whom I most fear to dis- trust, our quarrel can go on." "There can be no quarrel between u s," an- swered Shillinglaw, haughtily. "I may chas- tise your insolence; but that will be no quar- rel." , Cross swords with me, and I care not whether you quarreleor no," retorted Christy, resolutely. "You are rushing to destruction 1" whis-  pered Moll in his ear. "These are persons of rank." "( I fear no man!" said Christy, contracting his brows, and looking threateningly at the cavalier. "Peace, brawler!" interposed Gurther. "There shall be no bloodshed hereabouts. According govern yourself. Notice take!" 4 If there is to be fighting," said Moll, de- liberately drawing her weapon, "I take sides with Christy Kirk. As this is a woman- quarrel, Isee not why, I shouldn't be in it; for I would have you know, my masters, that I have designs on one of those maidens., First  come, first served; and I'll abandon my ad- vantage to no man, be his doublet black or gray.. "Impudent varlet!" exclaimed Shilling- law. "Were no restraint upon me, I would so dash .your consummate assurance, that the words ' page' and ' Whitehall would nev- , er again pass your lips." The self-made page was foppishy feeling the edge- of his sword, when the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard outside., fmmedi- ately. heavy steps resounded in the hall. All   eyes were turned to the door, where t tall man, booted to the knees, with a long, eurTed sword, in a metallic case, elanking atihiis .ide, quiekly appeared. He wore:a eonieal green beaver, the;.top of which reached above.,the lintel of the low door. There was something singular and incongruous about his, face,.not easily defined. His complexionwas darker than the average of men ; his features strong- ly marked and severe; his eyes considerably shaded by his prominent brows, whioh, curi- ously enough, were gray. Instead oftthe ex aggerated peruke of the period, he wore,ap- parently, his own black hair in long, glossy ringlets, that reached the collar of his dsub- let. The latter, with his coat and trunk hose, were green, as well as his huge; topb0boots His hands were cased in heavy riding gaunt lets, that covered half the fore-arm. .is ap-  parel was without ornament, and well beeame his commanding figure. A moment ot silence followed the advent of this personage. He threw a hasty glance at the parties; then addressing Cutlook, said, in a voice brief and cold: "My lord, I come from Whitehall." "Then your business concerns not me," re- plied. Cutlock, uneasily. "It concerns you so much, that I have' the king's warrant for your arrest 1" answered the other, his eyes gleaming from beneath the overhanging forehead like half-extinguished fires. "His mjesty has chosen a strangemessen- ger," said Cutlock, changing color, "and one whom I do not remember to have seen inmu- thority near the king's person." "My lord," said he in green, firmly, "it you would not have your private affairs dis- cussed in this company, step aside with me, and I will satisfy every doubt in regard to my errand. If you fear for your personal safety, let the cavalier in gray attend you." "Be it so I Come, Shillinglaw, let us hu- mor this giant of Gath, whom, it would-ap- pear, is honored with the king's confidence," said Cutlock, carelessly, following the estfin- ger. * "It is our luck to meet the favorites of his I majesty to-day 1" grumbled Shillinglaw, -eom- b plying with the wish of his friend. Looking -rom a window, Gurther, Christy Kirk, and r Kyte Linkhorn saw the three emerge ,from the door, and stand beneath the sign of the Barley Mow, within: three paces. of the new- 1 comer's horse- an immense brown steed'that t stood unfastened, with the-bridle-rein flowing  loose upon his arching. neck.

The I devi'e *hih at that date gave thb fabric its nam;, Wts a womart's head clumsily painted o1 wood, and hung b6eneath an upper central window by ain iron eatan*e. Up two flights of dejeted .steirs might hav  been found, ,on ospening. a .sqce tkieng door, a rookery of the fine asts of whioh one Ajaax Bransom was the life and soul. Entering this dusky lurking-place of art, the visitor was at onae impressed by the mul- tiplicity of feminine heads which met his gaze on every side. Thiere were- women in full; women abbreviated in various cruel ways; women cut off at. the w:iist; women bisected just beneath-the clavicles ; women dissevered at the fourth ceervical vertebra; women with nothing but face. If here and there -one of the luckless subjects of the artist's glowing imagination was discovered sitting, standing, or lying, every such instance was character- izedby a lamentable poverty of wearing ap- parel. Ajax Bransom was one whose artistic might waf consecrated fo woman; Woman abridged or woplan n- tote.' He had, passed the half- way house of life, and was stumping down- ward as fast s wicked habits could carry him. The handwriting of Sin was on his brow, and readable in the crow-feet under his blinking -eyes. There was a'bare sp'ot on the top of his, head, worn smooth by the friction of time; or possibly the crop had failed through the barrenneis of the soil. Short, itiff hair, mot- tled with gray, bristled from the lo*er eir- aumference of the head ;. while the same kind of grizzly' brush priouted like bats' wings from each side of hs faee. A hyTsiognomist would have called the latter foquacious and egotistical. His mouth was large and sensual, while his nose stood a bulkyr sentinel over it. The painter of Red Lion street had- a. dis- torted body; either one leg- was too long or the other tfo short. When standing on his feet, Ajax was a great deal awry; and he was mentally and  morally askew in whatever posture he might be. Nature sometimes sets her mark on bad men. A   week had elapsed since the scene at Hounslow.   Ajax, oi the Woman's Head, was laboring uder excitement. With his head-   depressed. his shriveled body pendulating to the play of hs unequal legs, f;is hands mov- ing like thie arms of a windmill, he wentimut- tering up and down the lumbered limits of his lair. As often as- he came back to the goal, he looked over the way impatiently. At length he paused, and shook a fist toward the dwelling of Primus Mallows. "A  dauber! i A black spider, weaving webs!" hearticulated, slowly and' vindica- tively. "Thle watchmaker said So to my face." Ajax' seitzed a brush; as' if to paint his wrath, in iborrible carridatire, in the air. ("A spider weaving webs! Let us remem- ber that. Mr. Mallows. Your girl's heal is too good for me to paint! It would contam- inate her to enter this room! We will lay that away with the rest." The lame artist plunged across his garret again, as if to take a bath of pictures. "'My studio reeks with the airs of St. Giles. None but vile and pimping people visit the Woman's Head.' A1l thhat to my teeth! All that to Ajanx Bransom, who has painted court ladics, countesses, and duch- esses!"  He paused to inwardly query whether he had really painted ladies, of rligh degree, either in part or in full. While whipping and goading hs memory, the fall- of a pic- ture caused him to turn to the door with a start. Angry rebuke that he was resolVed to let fly at tihe intruder, stopped on the thllresh- hold of his month. A man stood within the circle of the head-haulnted garret, from whose fixed gaze he shrank with secret terror. The face of this visitor was narrow and pinched, and startlingly panle. IIis eyes did not shine --they glittcel ed; His straight, coal-black hair, falling *over his broad white forehead and colorless cheeks, imparted a grim, Sata'n- io expression that made Bransom  quail and cower. The. figure was meagre and tall, and there was not an article of apparel on it, oth- er than. the gloomiest black., He-w ore shoes with large silver buckles, and hIis conical hat was witl,out feather. This spectral figure re- minded Bransom of infernal personages that he had ll herd of. HJe waited for him to peak, and malke known hs business, but he con. tinned to look at the artist with a mocking smile;  "What do you want?" faltered Bransom. "To see yout," answered the man, in a voice that apparn ltly c:ame from his stomach, it was, so, deep an:. rumbling, and such an ar- rant departure from the ordinary compass of human articulation. The painter retreated a step. "Why would you see me?" he aslred. "To know where to find you when due!" said the visitor, with a chest-laugh that was hollow and unnatural.   A superstitious spasm pulsed over the paint- er. Had there been another way of egress, hewould have fled to the street. Ho- sowly- backed to the farthestf limit of his studio. "Will you come a -little more to' the point?" he said, just above his breath. "You're coming! You're on theoronad  You're one of 'em!" answered the visitor. "One of whom?" demanded Bransomi much at a loss.    : "No matter. Don' heed me. Go ons - you have begunri, Keep adding sin to sini ahd crime to crime. DeCeive the' innocent; lai snares for tie weak; take, the virtuos'iby guile. Don't stop!" The blood-freezing stranger drew neatei to Bransom, and his lnatgh grew mbre frightful. "Go! leave me'! [I want nbthing:of you!" cried the artist, palc and'trembling. "And yet," added the man, suddenly chang- ing his mannei, "I doubt not thlat- younwl T liave more of me'tlan yotu knoi of." He drolpped himself into a cliair. "This is the verv brothel of art," he Went on, mockinglv. "'i see only- the faces ot women here,' Bransom. Paint me, imp of the brush, paint me!" He leaned back' in the chair, and made a' shocking face. "You are the devil!" gasped the painte,. "Begone!"  "So you recognize'rmo at last? -We shalf' meet often. You must not fopget me; - Think of me wlien you-'think of the' watclhmaker-' daughter, and the innkeeper's .daughter, nnd- Dare Cutlock, arid Orloff'Shillinglaw, and purses of -gold, and all the evil you have dpnob and intend to do." He laughed hoarsely down' below. "Did yonu-ever dream of Tybnirn or the T*-. er?" he added. "But I fear I disturb .uti in your' idol-temple. One of youiremissaries' is at hand, aind-I will go. 8pin out youi tliread, Brinsom-spin out your tlread, Weave your webs in this place of skulls asid, nakedness. Are there panders' at Clerkeii- well?  Are there; thieves- af St. Gil6s, and highwnymen  on 'HounsloW eI-athl? R  IFs*; you painted J&,ne Acre, and Bahb Crowfot,- and the Roaring Girl?   I, too, am foad o, heads! It delights me that outir tastes are so similar." As Br'ansom  stood wondering and iae0,' the grim'phantom  in black showed hs'whiteo teeth, waved Ahis hand, and' ent out. The painter leaned against thwe wall, weak aind. shivcring.           ] Tlhe squeak obf the door, and the light step of, a girl, partially restored his courage', The person who entered was about cigheien'i years of age, respectably clad, with' a face by no means disagreeable, though indicativ6 of' cunning rather than depth of intellect. The' o   sight of this young woman caused the paint- er to rally at once his scattered wits. "* Is it you, -Craw Kibbie?- I've had an ugly fright. The devil has been here, I believe." ," The devil is all about here!" said. Craw Kibbie, making a sweep around the room with her hand. "He is in all these painted faicos. But we won't mind him. I've got the place at the watchmaker's. His daughter is mistress, and I am maid. I'm across the way, bag and baggage." an the pleasure of hearing this, Bransom forgot his fright. His pale features blazed up' like a fire when it is blown with the breath. "In the enemies' camp, eh? It is mighty well, Craw Kibbie. Be careful how you step, girl! You will upset the Duchess of Cleve- land, if you flirt your dress in that way." "Duchess, indeed! That is Jane Acre, of St. Giles, and that next it, Mistress Crowfoot. Ah, you spider You said to each: ' What a splendid turn of the head ' " Tie painter having arisen to preserve, th ghostly shadow of Jane Acre of St. Giles Kibbie made no scruples of sliding hersell into the seat he hall vacated. Bransom turn ed a picture, stretched over a wood frame, upon its side. and with the jerking motions ot a monkey, perched himself upon its edge, his short lira-) hanging over the daubed canvass without touching the floor. "Put your tin her tenderly on my 'art," lihe said, wincing. "Don't touch the raw spots, my wasp."    , "That for all your daubs!" exclaimed Xib- bie, with a contemptuous snap of her thumb and finger. "I hate these fragments of wom- en," she went on; "I can't see in 'em what you see in 'em; because what you see in 'em isn't in 'em, but in yourself. I'd give more to know who I'm taking this trouble for, than for all these smirking faces put together." "A mystery!- a mystery!" whispered Bransom, masking one side of his face with his open' hand. "A mystery? Give it to meI It is as much for me as for you. The life of Craw Kibbie is a mystery. She breathes mystery, eats a'ld drinks mystery, in mystery sleeps and wakes. Disgorge, you spider Give me the end of your thread, or I'll bring no flies to your net. The paw that pulls the chest- nuts from the fire gets burnt. I'll be paw to nobody blindly. Out with it, or I'll grope the ashes no more. If it's for you, it won't do; if it's for a simple, slip-slop gentleman, it won't do; if it's for a humdrum lord, it won't do. An earl or a duke is another matter. What do. you say, Spiderlegs?" Bransom started up with a sharp, angry cry, like tilat extorted from a caged beast by the application of a hot taming-iron. He   pranced across the room, ducking and gestic- ulating. "Craw Kibbie," he said, returning, ' don't goad me too much l" "If I am the enemy of my own sex, what am I to yours? I am a deadly poison, to be used only in small doses. Don't take too much of me, man! I follow my own wild will because I. choose to. I am faithful as long as the idle whim is onr me. Enough I Now who is Dare Cutlock?" She pounced upon the painter sBO suddenly with this question, that he was flurried. "Dare Cutlock is Dare Cutlock," he answer- ed, presently. "That is all I know, or have any business to know, or any safety in know- ing. The secrets of the great are dangerous. One very powerful and rich, loves the watch- maker's handsome daughter. This person is your employer, your rewarder, and your theme. Dare Cutlock is to be artfully drawn into all your discourses with your young mistress. His love and generosity are to be played on as a stringed instrument. Lay traps for her heart'; set snares for her imagl- nation; raise dazzling heights for her girlish ambition to mount on." "Cease, dotard!" said Kibbie, restive un- der his wordiness. While both were busy with their plots for the entanglement of un- wary feet, neither saw the monstrosity that crept up the stairs on all-fours, slipped through the open door, and crouched behind a picture. This object was about three feet high, with a bloated head, face enough for a giant, old and impish, and arms so long that the fingers nearly touched the ground when he stood erect. His movements were quick as those of the monkey, and the stlrength of his limbs prodigious. Now and then he pop- ped his grinning visage above the picture, and peerand nd listened with keen enjoyment. Whenever Bransom and Kibbie changed posi- tion, or paused, his enormous head sank back behind its shield. The appearance of the cripple seemed to please him mightily. There was, to his apprehension, an impish relation- ship between them, the discovery and reali- zation of which convulsed his defrauded body with silent merriment. "Come, come, girl! Let -us be friends,"t said the painter, in a conciliating tone. "Pave your own way. Cutlock must see Ruby Mallows. He has not seen her since that chance meeting at the Barley Mow. He swears he will come at her, if he has to go in at windows." "He shall see her," replied the girl, and she made a mental vow at the same time that she would know who Dare Cutlock really was, despite the warning of Ajax. "My crayon, my sweet fancy-sketch," wheedled the cripple; "you shall have a   puree of nobles. How those nobles will shine!" The old, egotistical smile Came back to the pander's eyes. "You think to finger most of those same nobles," thought Craw Kibbie. She thought this and much more; more than was in the head of the leering old sinner roosting like a raven on the edge of the picture. . "Who is that springal that I see go in and out of the watchmaker's door so often, of late?" he wished to know. "The new apprentice," answered the girl. "I was going to tell you of him. You'll want to know his name; it is Dyece Hungerford. Look you, Sliderlegs! This fellow spoils every piece of work that comes into his hands, and can see no one at the Three Dials but Ruby Mallows. Put that in your pipe ,lad smoke it." "Provoking jade l" snarled Ajax. Then, thinking better of it: "You have1 not men- tioned Margaret, the little witch of the Barley Mow. Orloff Shillinglaw swears that he would have given fifty guineas rather than she should have seen that robbery at her father's inn. Both the coy wenches witnessed the whole transaction from an upper window. They didn't grieve over it, I'll be bound! It was a splendid rolbbery!, I believe there never was a robbery equal to it, save that of Sir Henry Bennett nnd Lady Castlemaine, a few nights before. And, what is most wonderful, he liberated a state prisoner from the Tower of London, after th'e robbery at the inn." The human grub behind the picture gri- maced from ear to ear. ' How could that be?" inquired Kibbie. "Who knows? who knows? It is one of those unaccountable things that bother peo- ple's brains once in a long time." Bransom went off for a moment into- a region of thought. He still sat on the pic- ture-edge. With his head and lean body thrown foreward to preserve his equilibrium as well as to bring him nearer to Ribbie, with his coarse, scanty hair bristling around the base of his head, like a wreath of dead thorns, he presented an elfish and striking figure. "Margaret Gurther is over there," said Kibbie, pointing across the way. "Let her courtly suitor look well to his heart. And to Christy Kirk, too." "Christy will be provided for!" prophesi- ed Bransora, lifting himself from his reverie. "Ah! don't stir-remain as you are. Pshaw! it's gone. You always spoil everything. It was a very good turn of the head for a com- monplace body like you.   I'll get my brush." "You don't do it!" said Kibbie. "I'm going, Spiderlegs. ' Move gently among my gods! Disturb   not a head. Keep that apprentice 'in sight. Look out for your gown, hussy! Don't run against that Magdalen. What think you of that superb pictu're of Nell Gwjnn? That is the Dutchess of Richmond by the door." "What is that?" laughed the girl, as with her foot she spun a bold face half-way across the garret, and made a flying exit from the art-rookery of the Woman's Head. '"A cursed Mischief!" garowled Bransom. "I am losing my influence over that girl. I must watchl Craw Kibbie. Ay! ay! ay I' The sprawling pigmy behind the picture flattened his three feet of deformity on the dirty floor, and patiently waited an oppor. tunity to escape. CHAPTER V. THE APPRENTICE-GRUB, THE DWARF. If the affections of Ruby Mallows had not been pre-engaged, it is protable that .the sud- den appearance and courtly grace of Dare Cutlock would have impressed her deeply. But that fluttering thing called a heart, hav- ing been surreptitiously appropriated by an. other, she was comparatively Eafe from the assaults of the prepoesseing stranger. ler cousin Margaret acccmpanied herhcme, to spend a few weeks in London, having been suitably warned to beware of gallants and in- triguee by the hocest but not far-sighted Bnrtemas Gurther. Bobh thece young wom- en were inspired with a secret dread of Shil- linglaw and Cutlock, whom, they were per- Euaded, were far different in station from what they wished to appear. That they were two noblemen from the dissolute court of Charles, they doubted not. They had questioned Mary Glasspool at the Barley Mow, but elicited nothing but vague and mysterious answers, which left the subject as much in the dark as before. Ruby Mallows was far from suspecting that the introduction of Craw Iibbie into the fami- ly, bad anything to do with Dare Cutlock or Orloff Shillinglaw. She was rather pleased with the girl, and disposed to make her a friend and confidant. On going down one morning into her fath- er's shop, after her visit to Hounslow, she was greatly surprised to see Dyce Hungerford seated at a window, with a glass thrust into his eye, inspecting the complicated and scat- tered mechanism of a watch.- She stood a moment in mute amazement, looking at her lover in his new employment. Impressed, presently, by a sense of the ludicrous, and in- stantly detecting his want of skill, she could not repress a soft yet merry laugh. The young man turned toward Ruby with the glass still in his eye, prodtucing a vast amount of redness and distortion on that side of the face.   'Ie tried to look serious, but a smile gradually broke over his features.' ^'What are you doing, Mr. Hungerford. Why are you citelly afflicting yourself with thati magnifying- glass? I'm afraid you'll put out your eye, sirl" said Ruby, when she sad sufficientlym'astered her mirth. i"I cry adur mercy l' answered'Hunigerford, placing 'his glasp upon"th. shelf beforea him, and arising. '"I  aln here to learn the useIfl *rt of ' wathnlking. 'Your worthy father's trade ha: f^r inemariy Attractions." - He tookl her tnresisting hand, -i And you," he added; sinsing his voice, " are the chiefest of them all." . ' This is not well, I thitlk, Dyce Hunger- 'ford," she answered, blushing at the intensity of his gaze. ' "It is wrong thus to deceive my kind, though sometimes choleria, father. I am sure you,will never learn to make a watch." "He cani learn to make love!" screamed a squeaking' oice that seemed to issue firm the Wall.? Both Ruby nid the young man were alarmed at this interiuption. They searched the room, but 'ould find no one.- Baffled but not satisfied; they looked inquisitively at each other. Just thien,the door. of a arge clock was pushed open; and a quaint and cu- rious: figure oteppet from the inside. It was the dwarf,' hos eheated and uncouth person. has been described. ie miade a low, grotesque bow, swinging his lopng aras, tlern plaeing his hands upon a counter t!at traverse'd one side of the shop, hopped upon it like an ape. Ruby wras tel-fired,' and shrank from the grimacing  and repelleint character. Not much argimnent would have been needed to convince her that it was .nemissary of Satan. Dyce 'Hungerford, however, though annoyed, did not talke the intrusion so seriously. He frowned' and shook his head" at' the shape-- pahtomine which Ruby4 in her perturbation, did not notice. '"Do not fear," he said to his fair compan- ion. "This misshapen thing will not harm you. It is of human, not infernal origin, as you aye. half disposed' to believe. * Speak to 'him, Ruby, and my word for it, he'll answer." "Who are you?. Or perhaps I should say, W/at are you?" she asked, in obedience to the: suggestion oFHungerfo'i;d. 'A mortal, like you," answered tire dwarf; "althoug h," he added, ivith a sardonic chuc. kle, " not compounded with so scrupulous re- gard' to the law of pioportions as yourself. ' YoVu arms are shorter than mine, mistress. Ha! hal   They are smaller, and they are whter; but'they are not so strong. You are good for the ground, but you can't scramble up the side of a house, or cling to the coping of a roof with your fingers. You cannot leap like a monkey, or run along the leads, or   r, swing yourself i0 at windows, or drop through lSky-lights and down chimneys." 9 "Where do you live ." pursued Ruby. The manikin leered cunningly. "That's what. I know and, you don't, mis- 1 tress. I can take care of myself, which is ,more than you can do." "What is your name?" "M name is. Grub. Grub! Grth I Grub! I Don't you wish your name, was Grub , D       I come an4 I go 1,      Above and below-- ' ,    And none of you know ' Sow happens it so. Yo-ho! yo-ho n" J The dwarf sang this distich in a voice stridu- ;1ous and screaming, The chorus came from a great depth, and went uip to a great height -now hoarse, now thin and shrill. "Fair maid, beware : Look everywhere Before' you dare ,Your heart to, spare. Yi-yare! yi-yare!" * "What brings you here?" demanded Hun- gerford. ," What brings you here? 'Tis eyes, and mouth, and voice; in short. 'tis woman. But go your way. You are walking over mines." Then to Ruby; "Dainty creature, this is dangerous pastime. Go one to the east, the other to the west." . Grub waved his long arms in opposite di. rections. . "Life is sweeter than love. Love, like but- ter, melts in the mouth, and that's the end of it. It is like a dinner ofrwines, that leaves but lightness of'the head and craving of the stomach." Grub laughed at his own wit; then went on again in his strange and ever-varying tones, which ran up and down like the scale of a flute rapidly fingered. lDe raised himself on the counter by his hands, and drawing up-his legs, oscillated between his arms like the pendulum of aelock. "A pasty is worth a hundred kisses. For that matter, I'd rather have one than many. Bal! what. are lips? Ashes, ashes, ashes! You, Dyce Hungerford, take to your heels and run, run, run! Would you see the Trait- or's Gatel Would you go into the Tower by water? I know ot dungeons twenty feet be- low  the level of the Thames' There are chains down there rusted by the perpetual damps." Ie stopped and drummed on his perch with his feet. "A 'pretty, pair! What a. pitv that; the foolery couldn't go on! Oh, the wooing,  The billing and the cooing, Will be your undoing,  'Tis Death you're pursuing.'- 9            .   Speak plainly," said IIungerford. "I won't!" cried Grub, angrily. "You know what I mean, and yot see the danger." "To what, does this singular being refer?" asked Ruby, terrified by his mysterious ad- monitions. "My heart misgives me, byce Hungerford." "Heed him not; these are but meaning- less gibberings." "; You lie!" screamed the dwarf, fiercely. "Your blood be on your own head!" Grul cast himself from his perch, and with a    single summerset alighted on a box beside Ruby, and throwing one of his arms around her neck, drew her head toward him, and whispered: "A  Watch C'aw Ribbie!" Ruby screamed with affright, but before she had time to resist or push him from her, he had whirled himself from the room and disappeared. CHAPTERl VI. WATCHMAKING AND WATCHMENDING.. The watchmaker's daughter and the ap- prentice, by the abrupt departure of Grub, were again left together. Tile opportunity was too precious to be lost, and Dy'ce Hun- gerford, in well-chosen words, told the story of -his love. "With you," said he, at the conclusion of the glowing avowal," I. should feel my happi- ness secured, and my life fortifi.-d against the possible vicissitudes of the future." "Our acquaintance has not been of long duration," said Ruby," but I feel an inward assurance that you are worthy of confidence. Be not too hasty ; take time to consider well, and above all, abandon this impracticable scheme of pursuing a business for which I am sure Nature has not fitted you. :I know the motive of your conduct, and it is flatter- ing to me; but I cannot escape the convic- tieo that it is dangerous to yourself. The words of the unfortunate being who has just left us, have, I confess, affected me much. I fully believe that he did not speak at ran- dom." Ruby turned ler soft and beaming eyes in- quiri'ngly upon her lover. "i A mad manikin, my girl!" he replied, re- turning her questioning glance with a look of passionate fondness, - -"A sense of unknown peril is not all that troubles mei," resumed Ruby. "There are times when you appear too learned, and su- perior to your position." Dyee Htungerford was framing a reply, whlen Kyte Linkhorn surprised the parties in very close neighborhlood. "Wot is 'ere? , Wot dewelopments is this '" he wished to know, putting his arms akimbo, throwing his body back, and tipping   Ihi. head toward the right shouider. "' ibI;': this lenrnin' the business with to,o :mucl wsk- locity?, I served a 'prenticesbhi o' seven year, and never got adwanced like this," "* I was talking with Mr. Hungerford about -about a new movement tthat he talks of get- ting nU," said Ruby, laughing at the infelioity of her invention. "It would be ndwisable for him to find out how to put together the old, movement as is common among us," replied Linkhorn, point- ing to the shelf upon which lay the scattered parts of the disemboweled watch. "I think, my friend," said Hungerford, "that I can contrive: a new escapement," "'Ere's inventions " said Mr. Linkhorn, sarcastically. "Atween you two there 11 be contrivances. Wot watches there'li be! -My heye!"The apprentice unconsciously looked at Mr. Lihkhorn's eye to see if anything was the matter with it -* If your mind runs on escapements, I adwises you to make one through the door or winder; for if Primus Mailers should light on ye a lengtthenin' the hair-spring of-bis darter's affections,'he'd so taklre the tick out o' your movement, that you wouldn't go ag'in for a twelvemonth.". "Come-come, Linkhorn 1, You're not a vicious fellow, and you needn't try to make the apprentice think so," said Ruby, coax- ingly. "I know that a gal's hleart is her main. spring; and when the main-spring of that kind o' timekeeper is tampered with, it never runs reg%]ar artervards. Sometimes it wi- bratcs slow, aMd sometimes it wibrates fast That. is the dewelopments." After these profound deductions, Linkhorn was taking Lis seat at the board where he was in the habit of sitting, when the street-door rang the little larum that was attached to it; announcing the entrance of a customer. The persOn who entered drew -Ruby's attention, nor could she prevent her regards from rest- ing upon him while he approached the long, low table or counter, and addressed himself to Linkhorn. "My watch," he said, "refuses. to keep time. Will you look at it?". He passed the watch over the table to Mr. Mallows' ansist- ant. His voice made Ruby start. Had she not heard it at the Barley Mow? She half thought, she Jeared so.. She could not help associating him with the robbery at Houns- low?"But his outward iman was essentially changed-providing her suspicions were cor- rect-there being nothing about his apparel to remind one of that daring highwayman. There was a similitude of face, but without that sternness and severity that marked the features of the robber of Dare Cutlock and his friend. The visage before her was grave. yet mild in expression. The watchmaker's   daughter was afraid to encourage her sur- rnises; but in spite of a determination not to notice him, looked at him persistently.  He was plainly and richly dressed, with noth- ing about him to signify that he ranked any higher than a wealthy citizen. The moment he came in, Hungerford hurried to his shelf, thrust his horn-enciroled glass painfully into his right eye, and with his back turned some- what to the man, applied himself assiduously to the fragments of the dissected watch. Ruby could not help smiling at his sudden inustry. Perhaps a little vanity unconsci- ously mixed with her silent mirth. Kyte Linkhorn took the watch with pro- fessional coolness, and opening the large sil- ver ease, studded with diamonds, peered into the mute mechanism. Thile wheels had stopped. The journeyman watchmaker drew an inter- esting moral from the fact. "I It has stopped, as you will stop, and as he and she will stop, and as I will stop, when the witality has gone." The owner of the watch nodded assent to this instructive thought. "There is this difference atween the dewrelop: ments of a man and a watch, or a woman, and a watch: When the inside works of a woman or a man stops dead, and 'stands dumb, there's no startin' 'em ag'in; but you can inwigorate a watch." The jurneymann enunciated this with some dogmatism of manner. "You should have been a parish clerk," said the stranger, dryly. Mr. Linkhorn raised his eyes slowly to the man whose- watch he held in his left hand, with a great black glass buried in his eye, and a small pair of steel pliers poised daint- ily in his right. By the pursing of his eye- brows, Ruby expected to hear something se- vere; but was amazed to see Mr. Linkhorn wilt like new-mown hay in the hot sun. Tho glass fell out of his eye, and rolled on the foor; the pliers went to look after the glass, while the hand that held the watch, dropped upon his knee. The stranger's brow knitted to a sinister frown; the broad forehead grew dark and severe, and the eyes beneath darted at Link- horn like two tongues of fire. For some sec- onds, he held the watchmaker dumb and mo- tionless with the mere weight of his frown and the glitter of his gaze. "The mischief can be repaired, I  sup- pose'? he observer, presently, laying two guineas upon the counter. Kyte Linkhorn struggled out of his wilted state, and said: "'It can be started ag'in, your honor." "Very good, my  honest friend," replied the other. "I perceive that you are a man of wisdom and discernment. He placed pe- culiar emphasis on the words wisdom and   - discernment, glancing at Ruby, whose beau" ) ty appeared to have the same effect upon him as upon many others, who had had the -good or ill fortune to see her. r She saw his look, and the change that swept tover his face. Though not offended, she was , annoyed. His gaze was not only intense but pertlnacious. "Wihen can I have it?" he asked. He looked at Hungerford. "To-morrow," said Linkhorn. "Very well," he rejoined, transfixing the journeyman with his glittering eyes. "I'll come for- it." With another glance at Ruby, he slowly withldrew from the shop. Linkliorn hung the watch on a little hook, and stared at it. "What has come over you?" queried Ruby. "1 don't know," he answered, absently. "I think I've been reminded of something I can't think of. There's dewelopmentssome- wheres, but I can't get hold of 'em." * You didn't ask his name?" added Ruby. "Hang me if I didn't forget it!" exclaimed Linkhorn, slapping his knee with his hand. "I'll "run after him and ask."- He sprang from his stool and ran into the street. He came back in a moment, muttering to him- self: "Nightshade, forsooth I Nightshade of the White and Black I Nightshade with a wen- geance!" "Nightshade!" -repeated Ruby. "Was there anything about that man that surprised' you, Kyte?"    . The journeyman reflected before answering' "I might seen   something and then I mightn't. A wise man never tells more than he knows, nor quite so much." - "True, true!" replied Ruby. ," I com- mend your prudence. There is much gos- sip in London about the White and Black." "If anything pops into your mind that is werry wague and uncertain, don't be in haste about lettin' it loose. If you don't let it loose, nobody can take the adwantage. ,Let it loose, and somebody wilt take the adwant- age. That's wot I calls policy, Mistress Mai- lers. It's a wirtue w'ich, in them as hasn't got it, comes out at the little end 6' the 'orn. Let them within the sound o' my voice profit bythe same." Mr. Linkhorn jerked his head toward Dyce Hpngerford, who, on that particular morn. ing, seemed fated to have the bitter mingled in large proportion with the sweet; for Pri- mus Mallows, as it soon appeared. had been watching him for the last half-minute from a door in the rear, opening into the shop from his dwelling. This worthy artisan ran at the young man in a violent passion. "The villain has destroyed a movement!"   -he voeiferated, seizing Hungerford by the shoulder and shaking him.  "Kyte Link- horn, why did you sit there and see him de- stroy a movement 9" "I didn't sit here and see him do 'it. 'Twai done afore I come in. It's too late to help it now; let him squint at it as long as he likes. He'll put his right heye out, by-and- by, that chap will. Don't touch him; he's- an inwentor!" The journeyman threw a contemptuous look at the apprentice, and winked slyly at Ruby. "Them pivots was set on rubies, and if he hasn't got more nor one ruby out o' kilter, I don't knorw a hair-spring from  a main- spring." The watchmaker's daughter blushed, and held up a threatening finger to Linkhorn. "This devil of an apprentice will ruin me!" grumbled Mallows. "Twenty guineas won't restore this watch to its former condi- tion." "Worthy sir," replied Hungerford, Miting his lips to preserve his gravity, "' this is my own watch,'which, being deeply interested in your most delicate art, I took in pieces to examine at my leisure. I expect to derive great advantage from this experiment." "So much that you'll lose your watch!" retorted Mallows, somewhat mollified. "Far be it from me," returned Hungerford, "to take such a liberty with one of your in- comparable time-keepers. As for the ruby settings, I trust none of them are the worse for my interesting investigations." Mr. Linkhorn hitched Lack' on his stool, erected his lean trunk, threw his long head a little to one side, and cocked his eyes at the apprentice,  "W Wot a wolloper it is!" The journeyman did not change his posi- tion ; he kept his eyes at a full cock, while the ghost of a smile gradually traversed his lips, illuminating the lower part of his face and relieving its recent severity.  The last expression tfiat escaped from his mouth ap- peared- to 'give vent to his comical amaze- ment. "W ot 'a wiwacious youth! Wot a 'ead! My heye, wob a 'ead!" Mr. Linkhorn made a rhetorical pause. and gently swept his recov- ered pliers through  the unresisting air. "This is the 'ead," he eloquently went on, "that inwentors is made of." His humorous optics deseribed enough of the segment of a circle to take in the pretty person of Ruby, whom he favored with a vro- tssque leer. His satisfied countenance said, as-palpably as eountenanee could: "Iow I have these two people under my thumb!" "Girl," saidl Primus Mallows, "are you , Joarning the business, too? You'll take a   movement to pieces, won't you, bv-and-by? You seem mightily pleased, egad[! at thbis villain's blunders." The old watchmaker of Clerkenwell pursed his chin and nether lip-towar-d his nose, as much as possible, and looked at his daughter in a high state of rebuke. "I wanted to set my watch," istammered Ruby. "Go along, hussy!" retorted Mr. Mallows, testily. Then to Hungerford : "You and I, my springal, will have to part company. What the devil is the fellow quizzing at through that glass? Kyte, you rascal, can't you put him in the way of doing something useful?  We can't have- idlers about the Three Dials. The reputation, of the Three Dials must be kept up." Linkhorn had plunged into another snb- ject, and was completely drowned to Mr. Mal- lows ; he was staring at the stranger's watch, and traveling a pathway of thought utterly unknbwn to his worthy master. "What are you moping at, you dog?" sputtered the latter. ' "Please, sir, may I stick up this 'ere bill? inquired a forlorn boy, thrusting a moppy lhead into the .Three Dials, and giadually working in after it a ragged little body. He carried in one dirty hand a printed bill, and in the other dirty hand a paste-pot and bruebsh. "You boy," said Mr. Linlihorn. reviving somewhat, " you boy, yor, 'ang it on- a nail. Don't swab your paste round here." The boy hung the bill on a nail as he was ,bidden. 'I There I ,begone, yon wnrmint!" Mr. Linkhorn said this from sheer habit of finding fault with all the boys who veantued into the Three Dials. He ind been known to throw things, Mr. Liklihorn had, and wna an object of tome terror to tattered urchins. The ingenious artificer did not at first deign to ,notice the printed waif left by the vmrTpy head; but presently, and prolably withlout consc;ous i ffort, be found himself looking at it; and the effect of the sight was such tat he automatiecally made a ew;n nlirg motion with his hands, and unfortunately, with such force, and in each a direction, that be ewept half the curious implements frormnhis board, together with sundry fractions of mov( crieta that chanced to be undergoirg )el ails. A. cylindrical glass, placed on a yr(eious ag- glomeration of wheels, pivots, and chairn, was ruthlessly swooped to the floor and dash- ed into numberless fragments. Mr. Mallow's arms were obtesting ly and despairingly flung in air. "We are all goina to smash!" he vocifcM- ated. "Kyte  Linkhorn, you incendiary, close this shop.  EgadI we might as well give up business as to go on in this way."   lr..tinkhornwasas a entirely oblivious to 'the paaaion of his employer, aS if that indi- vidual had not been within gun-s8Wt of thle Three Dials. He shot from his stool like a grain of corn in the act of popping, and de- aroibing half :a circle, alighted tihe other side' of the long table or aounter interposing be- tween him'and the wall. on which t he bill had been placed. This was a spasm of .emotion to which lLinkhorn winas unaccustomed, and its effoa, in the present instance, on Mallows, W4a quite remarkable.  "Odds fish! Marry come down!" , The last .exclamation was one which the watchmaker reserved for extraordinary odcca- sions, when his feelings needed tpecial ven- tilation. "The devil and all Ruby, jade, run for a strait-jasket and a blister larger than your mother's apron. This Linkhorn's head must be shared, and blood must be let in a jiff. Who's got a knife? Bring a little tub * I can stab a vein myself. If I get hold of him, damme if I don't let out a pailfu'l , -  The journeyman, meantime, began to read, in a multering voice, utter ly unaware of the : consternation his conduct was producing iil  the excitable mind of his master, whose first 1 actwas to edge cautiously to the door and 1 look it, to prevent the escape of the mad- man. " Five hundred: guineas!" the lips of Link- I horn were heard murmuring. "Five hun- I dred guin-eas!, Life of God! 'Five hun- 1 dred guineas for the apprehension and deliv- ery to justice of that notorious highwayman } who recently robbed two gentleimen at the t Barley Mow, Hounslow Honath, and divers and sundry other persons of consequence, among whom   are 8ir Henry Bennet, Lady t Castlemaine, the Duchess of Richmond, and g the Duches3of Portsmouth.

The journeyman, finuding himself thus roughly dealt witi, was   to greatly astonished, and lbad much to do to i- struggle clear of the. watcluiraker. e  * "Damme, sir!" exclaimed the latter, turn- a ing upon Dyce Hungerford, "( wily don't you e- throw yourself upon this madman, and help le' me secure him? He must lose blood, I tell - you! And may the devil fly away with me it d I don't open a vein!" n  -At this position of affairs, Ruby thought it d time to interpose, for she bIcg.:n to compre- 3, hend how mitters stood. It was some time, however, before her father could be made to forego his s nguinary purlpose, heswarineg e soundly, that the' letting of a bucket of Wlood - would be of infinite advantage, not only to - Linkhlorn, but to' himself in a pecuniary point of view, inasmuch -as it would save a I destruction oof property in the paroxysms of I this new-fangled distemper. t  Linkhorn nowfell 'to capering about the room, laughing and snapDing his fingers, which was ratlher unfortunate for the theory set up ),y the young woman, that iis eccen- tric conduct was the resullt of terror produc- ed by the announcement thatlthe dreaded and terrible highwayman, whom le had seen at the  Barley Mow, and of whom he had heard so many diieful takL, was, as the bill had it, " lurking about LonIdon."' "Five hundred .guineas!" he whispered, dancing  up to Ruby. "Thilnk of that! With five hundred guineas I can marry Jenty Mandrake, and set up housekeeping alulos like a lord'!" He made another' dve among the clocks, boxes, and watches, and' coming back to Ru- by, who stood in his orbit, said: "Wot dewelopments! 'My heye!" ("Hsh, you simpleton!" admonished Ru- by, in a suppressed voiee. "' My father has good reason to think youcrazy. If you have a secret, keep it, and don't be a dolt. You haven t got yourguineas vet; and there'll be time  enough to cut antics when you hear them clinking in your pocket." "There's no fear but I'll have 'em, Soul of my body! Do you think I'll let 'em filter through my  fingers'? Ha'n't I got a hold on him? Won't he come for the watch? Lord of my'life!  Kyte. Linkhorn can see as deep into- a  inill-stone as the man as picks it. Don't worry about me, Mistress Mallers. I'm a little wiwacious at the present speakin', but anon I'll be as wigorous in my 'ead as the Lord Mayor himself." Thie elated workman seized his hat, unlock- ed the door, and was soon running along Red Lion street, to tell Jenty Mandrake of his good fortune. CHAPTER  VII. THE PURSUIT OF GUINHAS. Kyte Linkhorn hurried through various   streets e'to Red Lion Square, thence to Shoe I Lane, Spittalfields. There was a whirl of excitement, a fever of expectation, in his brain. The prospective five hundred guineas loomed, before his imagination, an enormous and inexhaustible treasure. He had much to communicate to Jenty Mandrake, the weav- er's daughter. That day of happiness which unbending circumstances had hitherto push- ed so far away into the future, was now really at hand. He saw his wedding-night; Link- horn was of a sanguine temperament, and his fancy-traveled fast. He did not stop to give a premonitory knock at Theobold Mandrake's door, but lifting the latch hastily, rushea in, panting, frantically embraced a young woman, and nearly pulled the arms off a middle-aged man engaged at a loom. His sudden and impetuous coming produced various and contraictory emotions in the minds of his friends, who had never before seen him in such an excited condition. - Having driven- Jenty to a corner, he pro- ceeded to astonish and confound her by ex- travagant avowals of sudden wealth, myste- rious hints, equivocal intimations, and the general vagueness of his statements. He squeezed her hand; he pinched her cheeks; he smoothed her hair; he darted his finger playfully at those parts under the arms of girls supposed to be peculiarly sensitive; drawing abruptly back, shrugging his shoul- ders, and emltting- a startling little hiss at each particular dive. This singular conduct reddened Jenty very much, who properly informed him thet he ought to be ashamed of himself. 'With all her arts, coquetries, and reprimands, she could not reduce him to his normal coolness and sobriety. It was not without apprehension for his safety that she saw him depart. He set off for the nearest magistr/ate, but, changing his mind on the way, concluded to lay the whole- matter before the lord mayor. After various annoyances, and waiting two hours in an ante-room, he gained audience with that important personage, who received him with a frigidity that went far to bring him down to the common level of every-day life. When, with some stammering and faltering, the watchmaker had made known his busi- ness, the manner of his worship\became more gracious. He questioned Linkhorn sharply, after allowing him a few moments to collect his scattered wits. "You witnessed the robbery at Hounslow?" "Yes, your lordship." "It was a very bold affair," observed Sir John Lawrence, who was at that time Lord Mayor of London. "Saving your worship' presence, I never see anything so werrT wonderful!"   Kyte ducked his head in profound rever- ence to the greatness before whichh he stood. "It was a dewelopment, your lordship. Life of my body I he was such a elegant gen- tleman! 'Twould a done your worship good to have heard him. His voice was as soft as a cooin' dove's, wlien he clalped his pistils to their 'eads, and said: 'Sorry to trouble ye, my lords 1' " "It was very fine, no doubt," said Sir John, dryly. "How many of you looked on and saw this transaction?" "Three of us, my lord." "And you suffered him to ride away unmo- lested I Do you know I have half a mlind to imprison you all for complicity?"Sir John- looked sternly at Linkhorn. "May it please your worship, we bad no complicity nor any other kind o' weapons, or it would have gone hard with him. As it was, I seized the poker and a pewter. mug, and said: ' Bartemas Gurther and Christy Kirk, foller me, .and let us kill the wicious wagebond!'* But not a step would they budge. So, after he had toolk their pulses and watches, and a ring from the cavalier in black, he swung his great body into the sad- dle, touched his great, black horse with the spur, and broke away like a clap o' thunder." "You marked well his countenance and person?" The eyes of Sir John were fixed searching- ly on the watchmalrer, who, holdirg his bat awkwardly in both bands, rested his weight upon-one foot, then upon the other, vainly seeking for that ease and lshewdncss which seldom failed him in an emergency. ;' If I should live to be as old as Methusa- lum," he said, taxing his ready invention, "I shouldn't forget the robber's face." A peruked and powdered attendant an- nounced the Duke of Monmouth, who, enter- ing carelessly, made an imperative motion to Sir John not to notice him, but to go on with his official duties. Lle handsome, and then idolized son of Charles the Second, by Lucy Walters, advanced, and leaned gracefully against a column, not far from LKte Link- horn. "You feel confident, my worthy fellow, that the face and figure of this flying highwayman are permanently fixed in your renlembrance? Now what was he like? Give me some gen- eral idea of him. Was his complexion light- er or darker than mine? What was the fash- ion of his nose? Was his mouth large or small-his brows heavy or light? Look at me, my man, and speak without fear!" "He was dark; you are light, my lord. In comparison to him, your face is like white paper to old parchment. And as to the mats ter of nose and mouth, there's no more re- semblance than a sparrow to a pigeon-hawk.   Bis nose was a big 'un, and his bushy eye- brows gray. And then his hies! Lord bless ts, wot hies!" 4*-What of his eyes?" asked Sir John, bit- ing his lips, not, well pleased with solme of Linkhorn's comparisons. ' They was the same as if you should light two fires in the barrels of two 'arquebusses, and have them both leveled dead at you." Kyte Linkhorn turned toward the Duke of Monmouth, partly from curiosity, partly to note the effect of his striking figure of speech. Somehoiw it happened that the watchmaker's eyes did not immediately return to Sir John. His gaze took the form of a chronic stare. He chan ged color; ie was by turns red and pale; his wlhole expression was one of puz- zlhd and embarrassed uncertainty. Wonder and doubt held him mute and unconscious that Sir John was waiting for him to proceed. "Your grace will pardon this clown," said the mayor. "t I dare say heseldom sees roy- alty so near." "Certainly, my lord," answered the duke, with' a gracious smile. t"Your lordship knows that I count mvself one of the people." Then to Linkhorn, with a slight wave of the hand: "Go on, my worthy friend; I am much interested in this matter. Your last simile was a happy one. I am sure that I my- self could not forget eyes of that description." 'I 'umbly beg your 'ighness' parding " stammered the watchmaker. I I didn't tiink to stan' in this here presence. If I'm agitat- ed, it's because the dewelopmcnts i 'unex- pected, and because-because-" Linkhorn could get no furthler with the re- maining reason, but stood twirling his hat, scraping and bowing, the impersonation of fear and lhesitancy. "Speak up boldly, man," said his grace, encouragingly, toying with the hilt of his sword.  Be 'as much at your ease as if t  Clerkenwell, making watches. I am  by no means a vicious prince." He. laughed lightly, and the great diamond on his br:.ast flashed in Linkhiorn's face. '"If I might be permitted," resumed the watchmaker, somewhat assured, " the hies of the 'highwayman was fiery, and set deep in 'his 'ead, lile them of your grace." The lord mayor, who had arisen on the en- 1 trance of Monmouth, made a warning gesture r to Kyte Linkhorn.            ] "Your grace-". hebegan. ' "Hush, good Sir John!" interposed the duke.- , Let him proceed with his descrip- t tioin. Perhaps," he added, playfully, " some other of our poor features resembles this C famous outlaw "     *  '"He was a 'andsome man, your 'ighness- - a proper 'andsome, man I ' You might, in the world's wonder, find another like him; but r   * you'd have to travel far to light. on him. ' His skin was darker than youl graee's ; he had ,the same over'anging fore'ead; but, as I said, - his eyebrows was gray, and his nose a big 'un. ?f But I'm sure," added Kyte, adroitly, " that your grace is much the 'andsomer man of the two." "Do you hear that+- my lord?" said Mon- mouth, good-naturedly. "I'm not certain but t shall some day be hanged for this re- doubtable highwayman." "Let us hope a better fate is in reserve for your grace," replied Sir John, with a pro- found obeisance. d"Who knows?-whio knows?" murmured the duke, thoughtfully. "Strange indeed are the vicissitudes of fortune." His countenance grew grave, and during the moment of silence that followed, Linkhorn endeavored to put his mental machinery in order. There was a problem floating dimly in his consciousness that tie wished to solve, but could not. He 1,Oged for permission t0 withdraw, that he might think over mat- ters at his leisure, seize hold of the fag ends and broken threads of circumstances, and connect them in a reasonable manner. The day's events had been a series of surprises. He had not only mystified himself, but every one with whom he had come in contact.- In pursuit of the phantom of five hundred guin- eas, he had possibly run his neck into a hal- ter. Unwisely, he had compared the Duke of Monmouth to a highwayman, and was now ready to curse his assinine stupidity. "Does my similitude to this notable out- law cease at .my eyes?" asked Monmouth, who, having watched the journeyman for that purpose, now got him by the axes of the eyes, and held him with a sort of fascination. There was that in his expression which filled the unguarded watchmaker with secret ter- ror. He took a little time to frame his an- swer. -"No two persons, your 'ighness, could be more unlike, from the neck down'ards," he said, pressing a falsehood into his service. "And the more I looks at your grace's face, the less it resembles the highwayman, who hasn't your royalty of expression "Retract nothing!" said the duke, tartly. "I am content to look like that bold and really dashing fellow. And if he be caught, he shall not be hanged, if I can help it. He shall escape, because he robbed the-" Monmouth stopped-; he'did not complete the sentence. "He rifled Orloff Shillinglaw and Dare Cutlock right bravely at Hounslow, at the sign of the Barley iMow!" exclaimed Link. horn, forgetting himself.     \ 's Orloff Shillinglaw and Dare Cutleck! v repeated Monmouth, shrugging his shoulders,   and glancing significantly at Sir John. "When great men go masquerading for their diversion, they must espect adventures, bapsq and rmishaps, like common mortals." "Your grace speaks in riddles," replied Sir John. Then, to the watchmaker: "The Three Dials shall be watched. If this Night- side, or whatever title he may please to give himself, should return for his watch, it will be pretty much the last thing that he'll have to do with time.; for he will go from thence to prison, from prison to trial, from trial to,Ty- burn. If he be taken, you may rely upon the. five hundred guineas. Unless thie duke, wishes to question you further, you have lib- erty to withdraw." "Your lordship," muttered Linkhorn:, is werry kind!" Bowing low to. Sir John, and still lower to Monmouth, Kyte Linkhorn backed, with tol- erable self-possession, from the presence of these notable personages. CHAPTER VIII. "ACK BILLSON GIVES "MORB .AD:WICZ." Kyte. Linkhorn gained the street with feel- ings of relief. His mind,. since leaving the Three Dials, had passed through' several changes. His wild elation had subsided. The whirl and tumult were gone, leaving confused and dull uncertainty. The phantom of guin- eas was dim and obscure. To clear his mind and lighten. the pressure upon his brain, he walked'about till dark, and still perplexed and unsettled, sauntered into the White Horse. Fixing himself in the darkest. corner of the tap-room., with his. two elbows braced on a, table, and his long, thin face bowed into his palms, he, tried to worry out the problem that disturbed him. Linkhorn was something like a diveri who plunges very deep, and comes up with his hands full of mud., He was thus wallowing and splashing inthe wators of his embarrass- ment, when a voice that he had heard before, addressed him:              : "This one adwice, hear: Never give the bloo devils the adwantage. They're warmints as will floor ye in the course of ewents." Linkhorn looked up and saw the cropped head and fulled-up figure of Lack Billson, and I 'acknowledged him bye a chopping nod.   ' "You seem to be down in, the walley.? I Brighten up, my Ticker; brighten up!" Billson rapped cheerfully on' the table with 3 his knuckles. "Under the following diwis.-  ions all' troubles come The loss of your t sweetheart; the loss of your walables, and the loss of life. If you've lost your sweatheart, kt get another; if you've lost your money, there's 1 plenty more on't. But if a covey loses his t life, there's an end of dewices and wisdom." x   The watchmaker made a little grunt of as. ,sent.. "But here you is with life and the world afore ye. This insiniwation hear!"The va- 'grant fetched a, chair, and put it down with a great deal of clatter opposite Linlkhorn. "W'en the throat is dry there's grief in the eye. A cup of sack brings the spirits back." The journeyman ordered two bottles of sack, "We rry good! You are one e can take adwice. I 'oped to wisit yp at the Three Dials; but time is money, and a 'onorable wagrunt has scarce a hour to spare." "I should think," said Linkhorn, "that you'd have more time than you know weot to do with." "Quite the reverse, my Ticker! A wagrunt has tV, see everytling as is worth seein'. He ,rluns. to the fires and the rows; he wisits all the places of diwersion, and his business makes' it conwenient for him to be in crowds. He 'tends the criminal trials, and sees all the 'angings anti the quarterings, n,t to mention the cotchings of the 'eads of kings and queens. in baskets. But there's one adwantage: he an't compelled to go nowheres, a wagrant isn't, except where. he dam please." "' Atween a watchmaker and a wagrunt the dewelopments is different. A wagrunt isn't liable to lose five hundred guineas, and a watchmaker is," said Linkhorn, with an em- phatic look and gesture. "There's the wiciousness!" exclaimed ,Billson, triumphantly. "There's the wioious. ness o' bein' anything but a wagrunt. Did you ever know a wagrant to lose five 'undred guineas? No, you didn't. Nobody didn't. Mr. Billson puffed his clheelks, and his nose went down between two furrows of flesh, like ,a turtle's head illto its shell. "' How was it, Ticker? Name the adwersi- "There's been no partic'lar adwersity, but there's been dewelopments," said Mr. Link- horn. "I thought I could clap my hands on five hundred guineas; but the guineas, the more I looks at 'em, grows less and less." The journeyman's voice asked for sympa- thy and justice. i"The obserwation is this: The more you looks the less you sees. Again, in this. wise: The less you sees the-more you loo1ks. Wot you hadn't got you lost." Lack Billson slid his hand up over his raspy head to clinch these oracular words. T-he shrewdness of the venture somewhat puzzled tlhe watchmaker. "In the world's wonder," he said, searching ,the man's face for the key to the vast store- louse of his wisdom, " one might find the twin of that movement o' yours; but l'd be unwillin' to be. him as would undertake the.   iob. By wit, or lucky -hit, your remarks keep the time o' day to the truth, or thereabouts." "Peradwenture!" said Mr. Billson. "* You've got a spring as tugs your works w'ether they will or no. But to the guineas, set me back. To them my hands was p'inted. I hadn't 'cm, but they was in view. Well, wot is the logic? The logic is, that I went some- wheres. While at somewheres, I seen and heard summat that stopped me. With the lord mayor and the duke, something got in 'mong my wheels, and I've got to be wound up before I starts ag'in." "I pities lords and dooks! The wood is growed as will make the baskets-as will cotch their 'eads." "I'd thank somebody," continued Linkhorn, "that has a key, to wind me up. Take me to pieces and see wot's out o' kilter." The watchmaker looked around to see if any one had the tools necessary to that delicate opera- tion. "' Hear this insiniwation," said the vagrant, touching his arms. "T There was a 'ighwayman . mixed up with the guineas." "You've ticked it out exact. Put your finger on the man wot rides the three horses of three different colors, and look no further. I had that man. In havin' that man I had the guin- eas; in losin' that man, 1 lose the guineas. I went up to my lord mayor's. I told him wot I'd lighted on. I lodged information, Wot was the upshot? I seed a face as made all my machinery wibrate. I don't know why that face tilted my balance-wheel, but stun me if it didn't!" "Wot was the matter with his wisage?" "Smash my dial if I knows! I wish I did. I wish 1 knew why the sight of James Crofts, the Duke of Monmouth, the king's son, played the devil with my plans.' You should seen his hies I They looked me through and through; and though his voice was soft as the paw of a cat, I thought. I could see the claw of the same. I had a wague idee that the hies threatened me, tellin' me all the while to go home and mind my business, and let robbers and highwaymen alone. Now, w'en the son of a king seems to talk to you in this fashion, there's summat in the wind more than you knows on. He was gracious, the duke was; gracious with his words, but now and then he flashed on me dangerous. I was a fool, and hedrawed me- out. In describin' the hero-of the three horses, I said there was a likeness atween 'em." "Would you be so good as to let me take the measure of your 'ead? I wants to know wot kind of a basket it will be cotched in," said Mr. Billson, with mild interest. "Mv 'nd," answered Linkhorn, mourn- fully, 'won't never be mixed with the 'eads of kings and queens. 1 shall go off in some   strange way. Nobody'll know wot becomes of me, perhaps. Perchance I'll be taken away in my wittles. Or I maybe found some mornin' in the street, without witality. Or I may turn up in a'damp and dreadful dungeon aneath the Tower. 'these is the fancies as come and go." ' There's more to this than you lets on!" Billson blew up his cheeks and tapped them softly when they were fully distended. "Tick- er, you're afeard I You're conwicted o' sum- mat that is so wague at times, and at times so wivid, that you're in great wexation. I Shine out, man; shine out! Flare up out" o' the dark." Kyte Linkhorn shook his head as if he wouldn't do it. "W'en I says this much to a man, I'm that man's friend. I have a key as'll wind ye. Come with me. Let's go down to St. Giles in the Fields. I'll show ye wot life is, and where a covey can hide away from the wul- tures and wampyres of the law. You shall ,be a jolly 'un. This adwenture may turn out for your adwancement. It may push you to try your 'and at wagruncy. Who knows but you may soon come to sleepin' on a board or in a kennel?" ' "I was intendin'," said Linkhorn, " to be a family man."  . "( Won't you be a family man if you goes with us? Won't that family be a large and interestin' family? Beware o' rashness, young man! If you likes to be a jolly 'un, don't marry out o' your station. If you marries one as 'll toddle all day at your heels, as merry as a lark, all right and prop- er. Wot is it otherwise? Otherwise, it's the rewerse. Do you wenture to contradict me, Ticker? Isn'ttit the rewerse? You're down, an't ye9? Down on your back, with the ar- gyment atop ye. W erry well!" Lack Billson got his short legs under him, 'and puffed his cheeks at his new friend to such an extent that the latter feared they would burst. He looked like a man who had the best of it, and always meant to have the best of it. "This adwice hear!", The vagrant's facial bloat went down. His little cranberry eyes twinkled like two bits of painted glass in the focus of a dark lantern. He threw back his chest till his round epigas- trium formed a bow. The dumpy fingers of his right hand stuck out like the rays of a star-fish. "Scramble out from under that argyment. Settle the score. Adwance nothin' you can't make good. Let the wisage as worries ye wanish. And lastly, foller your wagrunt. I'll show ye them as owns all the wittles and clothes, and all the housen, all the streets and squares, all Lunnon, and all the world."   He made a graceful pause, threw a glance- half-pitying, half-contemptuous around him, and added: "Everybody is their servants. You works for 'em, and your master works for 'em. The sellers sell and the buyers buy for 'em. The bakers bakes, and the butchers kills for 'era. Likewise the wine-makers makes wine for 'em. Look at the mechanics. At the sailors, also. At the tailors, notwithstandin'. At the king and the queen, moreover. All them is per- widers." "Say you so!" cried Linkhorn.. "Upon my soul, -I believe you're right. Give me a sight of these merry rogues afore I sleeps. Who cares for Master Mallers? Who cares for watchmakin', 'prentiees, and 'scapements, w'en all the world is workin' for'emr! Wot's guineas, and robbers, and dukes? Wot's life unless it's jolly?" "It's a wapor!" said Billson. Kyte Linkhorn, paid the reckoning, and followed Lack from the White HorJe to the ,Crow's Nest at St. Giles. CHAPTER IX. ST. GILES. The watchmaker went down into the hu- man slag and slough, the scum and scurf of St. Giles.  The Crow's Nest was situated somewhere near Le Lane, in sight of Cock and Pye Fields and of the gallows, grim and significant, where criminals gave their last spasms of pain to offended law. This rook- ery must have been in close neighborhood to what is now Monmouth street. The Crow's Nest was one of those misera- ble dwellings of the outcast to which no word- painting can do justice. It had a dirty, tum- bling look, which Kyte, tipsy as he was, ob- served. The windows were awry, and the door was awry, and the gambrel roof was awry. Everything was awry. Everything was black, too. The tiles were black; the. moss that grew on them was black; and there were black cracks in them through which thehrain ran, in wet weather, in black streams. The boards, and'casements, and the rafters' yawn- ing out at the roof were black; while the straw and rags stuffed into the crevices and broken panes were black. The watchmaker did not notice these de- tails, only the general blackness and forlorn-- ness. There were other rookeries near it quite as ragged and black; but, despite their sombre companionship, the   Crow's Nest seemed a thing by itself. The first duskiness of night was on it like the shadow of a rav- en's wing, adding to the murkiness of its dark and phantom outlines. Lack Billson, standing on some sunken steps, got hold of a rusty iron knocker and' thum-ped away   perseveringly. His strokes   1 presently brought a shuffling step, and some hands, and a voice. The Lands opened the door, and the voice spoke : "Who's breakin' the door of an honest woman?" "It isn't I, Babh Crowfoot, ds I doesn't know the woman you speaks of; and not for a hundred pound would I bargain to break the door of sich a one atween this and morn.- in," answered Billson. "Go away, yon beggar!" said Crowfoot. "It's your own wagrunt 1" persisted Bill- son. "Come in, then, and don't stan' shilly- shallyin'.  What is this? Who do you bring? Why didn't you tell me you wasn't alone?" "Mistress Crowfoot," returned. Lack, "I brings a addition to our numbers. I brings 'un as was born a watchmaker, but 'un who, I trusts, by the mercy o' God, 'll die a wa- grunt." "He's welcome." "Peradwenture!" "Unless," added Bab Crowfoot, " he has a fool's wit and a blabbin' tongue." "As foAi my wit, I have all that was give me ;. and in the matter o' tongue, it's my prayer to the blessed saints that it may never run so fast as a woman's, which 'll outstrip any watch in the kingdom," replied Linkhorn, who was full enough of sack to give latitude to his speech. They were now in the Crow's Nest, and the woman called Bab Crowfoot had shut the door and secured it.)- The journeyman looked about, expecting to see some of those lucky people for whom the working portion of Lon- don were laboring, but saw nothing save bare walls, lighted dimly by a candle carried by the woman. Disappointed in this, he turned his attention to Bab Crowfoot, who appeared, thus far, to be the only representative of the Crow's Nest, and was ugly enough to be the devil's mother. She was of large frame, and her bones took particular pains to stick out wherever there was an articulation or an an- gle. To tell the truth, Crowfoot had an an- gular chin, an angular nose, angular cheeks, angular eyes, angular principles, and a screw mouth. Respecting her voice, she was like a fiddle, which, though a small instrument, is capable of a great deal of squeak and screech. Bab was not so well dressed as many wom- en in London. Each article of her toilet had obviously worn well and a great while, as the frayed and faded warp and woof suffi- ciently proved. Her clothes 'hung as closely to her shriveled person as they could for bone "Trot along!" said Billson. Linkhorn heard a hum down below, and followed his conductress to aflight of stairs,   up which hot and pestilent air came finning. Descending, he was in the Crow's Nest-the home and 'resort of. those happy people for whom everybody was slaving. It was a bad place; the fact couldf not' e disguised nor put out of sight, The watchmaker was not so befuddled as to be ent'irely insensible to a thrill of disgust and fear. .. In a large, underground, room, the eeiling of which was 'so low' that Linkhorn had to take off his hat, to stand erect, were gathered:, in ragged conclave, about fifty 'persons of both sexes; as miserable a companFLy to look at as could be found anywhere, ut as merry as crickets.        : "This scene surwey!" 'said Mr. Billson, stretching out,his short arms, like one in the act of bestowing a benediction. "I see a good deal of rags and dirt," re;- plied the journeyman. "Peradwntire . But what should:, ou see but rags and dirt? Isn't the nicest clothes to be conwerted into r gs -at last? Isn't mani and woman to be conwerted into dust, noth withstanding? You a'n't agoin to git above your elemeuts, be ye? Look at'em! Behold! See, also I Observe, moreover I How cheer. ful is this. Here's women and children, and men and orphans, who have raised theirselves above the wile prejudices o' the wulgar, and snapped their fingers at, Care. Wot'as riches? Wot's housen and lands? Wanity! ,Wot' s kings and gover ments?   Vaanity! Wot's. silks and welwets? Wanity! Wot's perfumes arid lookin'-glasses? Wanity and wexation!" "Hear! hear! hear!" cried Bab Crowfoot. A  dozen voices shrieked and'roared: in ad- miration of the wisdom of Lack Billson. "St 'your tatters agoin'! Fall to with your feet! Be blithe, my children! You've got nothin' on your minds, abd some of ye ha'n't scarcely nothin' on your backs; therefore be gay. Not one of ye is a king. Not one of ye has got to set on' throne.' Not one of your 'eads will be cotched in a basket. - Con- sequently, link to it. Flicker, flame, flare up. Blaze, my coveys, blaze!"' Withi yells and movements more lonse than graceful, the vagrant company began a bois- terous dance. Men, women, and children, launched into one common jumble of motion. It seemed to Kyte Linkhorn that hecould see nothing but arms jand legs. The imme- diate cause of this human stew was a low- spirited bagpipe, with, a drone like a canting parson. This instrument was played by Mr. Ingulphus Hutch--a person about half-full of lead, and of great experience in the wars. Mr. Billson informed the journeyman that there was not, probably,. such another fighter in the whole world.  ' And as for wounds," lhe added, "you can't put your finger on him anywhere without touchln' a scar. All kinds   I o' weepons lias been jabbed into him. You'll - find the p'ints o' -swords, the 'eads o' lihalberds and spenars, and the balls of arquebusses, you'll find in that man. The -stories .that he can tell of the wars o' Cromwell!" Seeing a, stool, Linkhorn sat down on it. "Set!" eaid: Bab Crowfoot. "And may you be happier than one who hasn't slept for forty year."  , '      , , The journeyman' looked for that wretched being.,     .- "She!" said the vagrant, plunging bhis finger at Bab. '"She" " "Stun me if 'tisn't odd!" muttered Kyte. "Werry hodd!" .said Billson, cocking his eye. "Forty year;" added Bab, reflietivel4*, is a long time to' go without sleep." "Too lo g "' said Kyte. "Forty year, if it's a day! May you never Jlive to -keep awake -so long." Bab fetched a deep sigh from the. lower regions; Hersighs had .the sound! of coming from a great dis* tance. : "Why don't you go right to bed?" asked :Kyte, a little anxiously. "What's the good? If a body can't close her eyes in slumber arter goin' to bed, what's the difference atween settin', layin', and stan'- in'? But I a'n't without my comforts. I smokes a pipe ;! I takes a cup o' tea; I keeps ,the Nest tidy, and my 'enart is gladdened by a sight like this. There's only one other drawhack, wiq h is the law. What a world it would 'a' been :if law had been kept out on't! It's the'law I've been thinkin' on these forty year, layin' awake nights, a turnin' and tossin' on mv bed.*" Bab emitted a hollow moan, then pointing ,to the beggarly crew, added: "See my ducks! See my'doves! See my ground-sparrers I What a sight it is! 'But I must give. this nice lad somethin' to take." She nodded at Linkhorn, and he wtas the 'Inico la-dl' ." For a wonder, Lack; you've brought us no fooi. So be wants to jine our. lambs? So he w;ants to be one o' the real mastelrs o' the land? So he has looked into the. maillstone. Wont 'he be a merry oie, though?  Wo1p't he make the lassies' 'arts nche? O my, mymy ! What a rogue, what a rascal, what a knave it is!"Crowfoot langhed a little thin laugh, that had all it could do to get up to, and dut of, her screw mouth. "What pleasures and delights and enjoy- menlts is afore us all. May you be blither than one as as hasn't slept for forty year!" Bab Crowfoot started off to obtain the drink she had spoken of, and Billson follow- ed her. Linkhorn noticed them  conferring together in a corner. The uncouth riot of limbs and voices went on, gathering violence and wildness with the   heat of exercise. The long, uncombed locks of women floated'like streamers in the swel- tering air. There was 'a festering stream of garlic, ale, and perspiring bodies. There was a swirl of rags, and filth, and nakedness. The chatter Of children, the giggling of girls, the cackling of harridans, and the shouts of men, mingled in barbaric chorus. The bag- pipe wailed and shrieked with increasing ve- hemence, responsive to the vigorous arm and sprightly fingers of Ingulphus Hutch. Linkhorn sat with open mouth, dumb with wonder. Some one came to him; he didn't know'whom; he didn't look to see. He was following the whirling, swimming mass-the vulgar fractions of humanity. He heard his name spoken in his ear, then turned with a spasm of surprise, to see, not one that he knew, but the face of a strange, unwashed youth, who was gaping with all his might at the dancers, unmindful of himni, apparently, as if he had been at the Three Dials, bending over his little shelf. Kyte, having-inspected inquisitively the unknown countenance, sent his regards searching in other quarters for an explanation of the phenomenon which had startled him. "Escape from this place, ifpossible! You are in danger!" -    .-  These words he heard distinctly, and there was now no doubt as to their origin; they came from the youth beside him, and made the poor journeyman shake with apprehel- sion. He was more afraid because the nature of the peril was hidden from him. The walls, the dancers, and everything around him, in- stantly became objects of dread. Gone was his inward quietude; dispelled at one, swoop his careless ease. "Wot is it?" It was a brief inquiry, but put in a tone that made it emphatic. The unwashed face was fixed with dull apathy upon the vagrant rev- elers; it appeared to sense nothing save the swirl of legs and arms. But anon his lips moved. "Don't draw attentionto me! Look at the whirlpool of rags when you speak. These people are as suspicious as degraded.; as malignant as thWey are vile. Their daggers will fy out at the first sign of treachery in one of their number." A cold sensation crept from Linkhorn's feet to his stomach ; for it is the stomach that first responds to terror. He began to warn home his scattered senses. "Who-are you, and how do you know me?" he asked. The youth threw his body slightly forward, and whispered: "Moll Pool!" '"Life of my body!" muttered Linkhorn. "Be discreet! If you betray me, we are   both lost. Those wretches would rend us limb from limb. We should be trodden be- neath their frantic ,feet. Are you cunning enough to frame an excuse to get out of the Crow's Nest? Bab Crowfoot will' be back soon. Drink as little of the mixture she will give you as possible; spill it in your bosom or on the floor. Feign intoxication. Swear you will live and die with 'em. Cut capers with the maddest. Vow that you will rob Primus Mallows and divide the swag." Moll Pool began to float with her hands and arms, and pirouette. Snaplping her fingers, and swaying her head, she came back to the watchmaker in a moment. "Good Moll! sweet Moll! For God's sake don't leave me!" he entreated. "Be a man, and keep your wits about you," said Moll, dancing around him. "Come I up and set off with me." Faint at stomach, Linkhorn arose, and Glasspool, seizing him by the shoulders, plunged with him into the rushing vortex. "To it, my gull, to it!" she cried. -In with your walkers and chase the music. After it I after it! Here it goes - this way and that way. - Stump it! stump it 1" the thud of feet made the Crow's Nest shake. The clapping of hands, the snapping of fingers, and the dull roar of voices floating on the screech of the bagpipe, together with brandished arms and half-naked figures, lent a weirdness to the scene, strange and inde- scribable. Linikhorn's heart was in his throat, and he fancied he could taste it as it pushed and swelled in his larynx. The reck and fetor oozed out in a poisonous stream. "See my ducks, my doves, my chip- monks!" squeaked Mrs. Crowfoot, in an ec- stasy of innocent exultation. "' What a de- light it is 'to one which hasn't slept for forty yeamr! To one which has laid awake through the watches of the dismalcholly night, a thinkin' of the law and them which made the law, and them which, for the makin' of the. law, oughter be hung by it; hung in chains on a gallus higher'n Haman -hung, when Mor- derky sot in the king's gate." "The above insiniwation hear!" admon- ished Billson, lifting on high an impressive finger. With the raising of that finger the bagpipe was squelched ; it died with a hollow quackle, suggestive of a throttled goose. The moment the thing expired, Ingulphus Hutch made a dive at the new candidate for vagrancy, begged the honor of drinking with him, and wanted to know if he had ever been in bat- tle. Ingulphus was terribly behacked and be. slitted. Scars on his face lay in groups, and crossed each other at every conceivable angle. Mr. Hutch said they were received in honor-   able waerfare, every one of, them. His vis- age, on that account, and some others, was not handsome. His mouth was in the pat- tern of a&half-moon, with the concave side toward the nose. The corners of said mouth running toward the eyes, was an unhappy ap- plication of a new principle in the construc- tion of aface. His garments were the deci- mal fractions of military reminiscences. The lace on his doublet and coat was a good deal shredded, and the faded fabrics presented gaping Wounds mnde by the cruel thrusts of Time. By reason of injuries in his chest, In- gulpbus spoke in whispers. But such whis pers I They were as cutting as a sabre. They went through the air like a ball from an ar- quebuss. There was no escaping those whis- pers. The roar of a lion could not have been more distinct. Gestures went with those whispers; ges- tures that were yoke-fellows for them. To the grim warrior's inquiry, Kyte was obliged to confess that he had never been in an actual battle. "I'm sorry," whispered Ingulphus. "It's a great thing to been in battle. Ps born in battle. My mother was avivandiere. She was taken in travail with her canteen at the lips of a dead soger. My first suit was the colors of the regiment, in which I was rolled up. My first sleep was on a- knapsack, with a broken drum sot over me. Bab Crowfoot, you old trot, where's your ale? Don't you see this gen'leman and I is a waitin' for it?" Hutch looked at Bab, and the scars on his fcee twitchled. Kyte was at a loss to know whether there was a secret understanding between them. "Bring us a ugly mug apiece." Then to Kyte: "I've been stabbed and jabbed. Give me your finger." ' Insulphus grabbed Linlkhorn's right fore- c finger and carried it directly to his head, where he rubbed it to and fro on a horizon- tal ridgepole of bone. When he had fully im- pressed Linkhorn with the absolute certainty of said phenomenon- he looked at him with benign pitv, hnd whispered: "  Broadsword!" The effect was- thrilling on those who heard I it. The broadswod, with nods of approval, went through the company.' It seemed a good thing to be ridgepoled with a broadsword. There was a glitter of mild triumph in In- gulphus' eyes.    ' Linkhorn had scarcely got his mug to his lips, when the bagpiper pounced on the other hand, and rubbed the fingers on his chest, just below thie collar-bone. There was  a slight prominence of the skin. "Bullet!" hissed Ingulphus. The announcement was well received. "Fullt of' lead " he added. He spoke like E one conscious of his own deservings, but with-   out the heart to set himself above his fellows. He wished it to be felt, that he could deliver a profound aphorism without pride; had Ibeen cut to pieces, and shot to pieces, and yet mingled with all present on equal terms. He swallowed half his ale, placed the mug on the 'floor, atnd pushed up his hose. "a Spear head!" he sibillated, oracularly. "Cut it out myself withl a cleaver. Allus does my own cuttin'." All seemed surprised that he should do his own cutting, although there was riot one of them that had not heard the story a dozen times. After their excitement, they looked a very innocent assemblage. Theil eyes were frequently fixed on the watchmaker, as if :they expected something. Moll, who kept near him, gave him a nudge with her elbow . "Wot a jolly place is this!" he said, re- ,membering Glasspool's injunctions. "k I wish I'd heerd about this afore. I won't go back to the ticker business, I warns ye. Smash my dial if I don't bring ye a windfall! Primus Maller's is a ric', 'un -- a werry rich 'unl There's plenty o' swag at the Three Dialsfor them as has wit enough to git it." This piece of deceit cost poor Linkhorn a powerful- effort. He was shaking all the while in his shoes. He saw Moll make a sly motion toward his pockets; and taking the hint, pulled out what coin le had, and scat- teled it upon the floor, when it was eagerly scrambled up by the vagrants. This, instead of appeasing them, whetted their rapacious- ness. Every one fortunate enough to get a piece of money, slent it for beer, while the others growled, and half-a-dozen ragamuffins, seizing Linkhorn by the shoulders, drew off his coat in a twinklng. He was going to re- monstrate, but a glance from Moll Pool check- ed him. "A  wagrunt," said Billson, " wants none o' the superflooities o' life. He wants to fare no better nor his brethren. He's satisfied to divide his goods among 'em, even to his coat and doublet, if they happens to, be of a sal- able character. He aspires to git into rags as soon as possible arter he's made up his mind to jine the jolly 'uns. Don't be in a hurry, my coveys. Keep wot you've got, but take no more, lest my frien' Ticker should be led to the conviction  that we're cormorants. You've got doublet and coat, and nothin'more shall you have, except his trunk-h'ose, his shoe-buckles, and his hat." The watchmaker could scarcely compre- hend the kindness of his patron, Billson, whose goodness left .him nearly as naked as- when he came, into the world. In fact, the journeyman stood in his shirt, which Lack declared, with virtuous indignation, nobody should take from him. "What' a game boy he is!" cried Crowfoot.   "What a broth of a tramper he'll make! One says it which :hasn't slept for forty year. One which has laid awake through the still watches."  "Come with me, my infant wagrunt," said Lack, taking Linkhorn by the arm. "I'll inwest ye in garments as is conwenient for the soft side of a board, or a wacated kennel." "This," gasped Kyte, "is dewelopments! I didn't expect nothing as would bear no com- parison to it in the world's wonder. This 'ere is freedom," he added, with chattering teeth. "This 'ere is wot I calls beginnin' at fust principles. I'm proud to meet ye. I'm in a hurry to git above ground soon's con- wenient, so's to try a snooze in the gutter." This was received with shouts of laughter. "Fall back, my masters," added Billson, dragging the watchmaker away, "fall back, and don't make wanity and wexation of a good thing. So fur, all's in order, and I 'opes there's not one ,in the Crow's Nest as would take an adwantage. Be content till I brings him back to you enweloped in wirtuous rags, w'en he wilT be your affectionate pal and brother thief." Linkhorn suffered himself to be led away like one in a maze. He hardly knew whether the floor was sliding under him, or he was walking over it. He east a glance, behind him to see if he, could glean any comfort from Moll; but her face had disappeared in the motley mass. Ingulphus Hutch and Bab Crowfoot came stumping after him. "Where are we goin '?" faltered Kyte. The vagrant lifted a trap-door at the ex- treme end of the room, and descended a ladder The journeyman hesitated about following I but Hutch pushed him from  behind, and he made a virtue of necessity. Down went the c watchmaker; down into the mysterious depths i of the Crow's Nest; down into the darkness, against which the candle in Billson's hand t flamed feebly. I Kyte sighed for the Three I Dials, and cursed the phantom of guineas. I He was on a damp earth floor, and went a reeling after his conductor, full of dread. He -e was not in a state of mind to judge how far f hewalked, nor how  many turns he made. is Fear benumbed his faculties. He was con- a sciqus only of being on his feet and tottering ff after Billson through a dim and murky space, jt andof hearing Hutch whispering at his heels. a Of him and Crowfoot he was terribly afraid. tl Hle expected to be stricken from behind and dispatched. He  stopped presently, and was M thrust into a black place. He implored Bill- M son not to leave him there        o "Don't lose your wiwacity," replied the p vagrant. "Keep up   your ,wigor. Look at vi rats, A'nt they wagrunts, every one of 'em? sl -Don't they live in holes? You've made a gi good beginnin', nmy Ticker. Think of the m   e wisage you see at the mayor's. Think of the five hundred guineas, whichyou'll have when, I the man as rides the three horses, the black 'un, the white 'un, and the gray 'un, is pounce l ed on by the wultures and wampyres o' the I law."          I "The law!" screamed Bab. "The law ' which I has thought on through the still ! wabtches for forty year. The law which them as made it oughter be drawed and quartered, and stuck up on poles in different places. This is the place where there is no law in. You wanted five hundred guineas for the pret- ty boy. Ho! ho! ho!" The screw-mouth and angular face, work- ing with spite and hate, was more frightful to the journeyman than all his conceptions of the furies. A door was closed upon him and bolted. He was alone with nakedness, terror, and dark- ness. He crouched upon some wet straw, shivering with cold, distracted with doubt and apprehension. CHAPTER X. THE DWARF'S WARNING. "Your father, Mistress Ruby," said Craw Kibbie, " is anxious about the journeyman, who hasn't come back." - "He is very regular in habit. Something has happened to him. He is always here at \ this hour to look after the shop," replied Ruby, who, with Margaret Gurther, was in her chamber on the evening of the day following Linkhorn's visit to the lord mayor. "If you  please, ma'am," added Kibbie, "your father thinks he may possibly be at Mandrake's, Spittalfields." "Margaret and I will go there. Bring ovr cloaks, Kibbie. Jerity Mandrake can give us information about Linkhorn, if any one." The girls were soon ready and on the way to Shoe Lane, attended 'by  Craw Kibbie. The *evening was somewhat advanced, but Ruby Mallo\ws had good courage. She had at: first thought of asking Hungerford to ac- -company her, but abandoned the idea, on re- flection, for more reasons than one. His serv- ices would be required at the Three Dials, and his absence increase the irritation of her father, who made it a point to fret when his journeyman was gone; It must be privately admitted that Ruby would have been glad of the company of the apprentice. Tlhey were passing Lincoln's Inn Fields, wlhen the dwarf suddenly presented himself. Margaret Gurther, who had never seen this object, ciiing closely to her cousin and urged precipitate flight, but Ruby had different views of the subject. Although inclined to shrink from him, his former interview had given. her a curiosity which she hoped this meeting might, in some degree, satisfy.   (' Go back! go back!" he cried, beating the air with his b1ng arms. "s What are you here for? Who told you you might come out? You have no business to be walking at night." , What ungainly creature is this?" asked Margaret. "Don't vex .him! It is an unhappy dwarf. I have seen him before," answered Ruby. "MsDy name is Grub, Grub, Grubt Fair Meg, don't you wish your name was Grub?" ,' He calls me by name!" exclaimed Mar- garet. "Name?P I know everybody's name. I'm Satan, Satan, Satan Call me Satan,. won't ye? Call me the devil, dear. How's -the Barley Mow, Margaret? How is Bartemas? And. how is Christy, Christy, Christy? Oh! ho! ho ho! The color's creepin' up-creep- in' up, isn't it? I can see it creep, creep!" The dwarf clapped his hands on the ground and pendulated between them. "What a wonder 1" said Meg.. "Call me -devil, dear; call me devil; Craw Kibbie, go awayl I'll light on you, Craw Kibbie, if you don't go away." "I won't! I wont I Stand off, you fright. Come anear, and I'll wring your neck 1!" Grub rolled toward her on his hands and feet, like a wheel. Kibbie retreated, scream- ing. "I'm a vampyre 1" screeched Grub. ".I suck the blood of girls." "I'm afraid he'll hurt her," whispered Margaret. "No, no. His mischief, I think, is harm- less ; he will but give her a fright." The dwarf converted his arms and legs into spokes again, and revolved back. "Oh, you disgusting sea-spider!" cried Kibbie. "Come a step nearer," retorted Grub, "' and I'll throw my arms around your neck, and kiss you." "Horrid 1" Craw Kibbie fell back a few paces. "A cavalier in gray, and a cavalier in black!" muttered Grub, for the ears-of Ruby and her companion. "So you have given them an assignation at Lincoln's Inn Field's? Shame, my pretties-shame 1" "Nothing can be farther from the truth!" replied Ruby, indignantly. -"It looks like it. Here you are, and there is Craw, Craws Craw." His voice 'sounded like the notes of a raven. "Craw, Craw I Didn't I whisper to you of Craw?" "You malign her. She is the most faith- ful of girls. She grows in my favor daily," answered Ruby, earnestly. "A fool, like the rest of your sex 1" retort- ed Grub, angrily. "I thought you were sen- sible, as well as fair. But one cannot be handsome without being foolish. A pretty   face is the sign-board of idiotcy. Craw is an imp I But Craw has wit and you haven't 1" Kibbie was edging up, and Grub wheeled at her again with great impetuosity, striking at her, feet like a, monstrous foot-ball. : He threw up his arms to clutch her. She sprang from thim in disgust. He was at his former place again in two seconds. "Run," he said, " and you may avoid them yet." " Avoid whom-?" asked Margaret. "Cutlook and Shillinglaw."  "I don't care for them," added Margaret. ",Oh, nol' You want to see them, I'll be sworn I You are here for that purpose! Shame, again, shame 1" "Spiteful creature!" said Ruby, with flush- ed face, " we are going to Spittalfields, to in- ,quire for Kyte Linkhorn, my father's jour- neyman, who has been gone from the Three Dials since yesterday morning." "Since yesterday morning?" repeated the dwarf, thoughtfully. "Yes. He left- the shop, laboring under excitement, produced by the reading of a placard, offering five hundred guineas reward to the person or persons instrumental in ar- resting a highwayman who haunts London and Hounslow Heath."' Grub swung on his hands, and laughed through the gamut of his voice: "Ho, ho! hi, hi I Here's fn for St. Giles. IIf the journeyman comes back, you'll see him; if he don't, you won't. Call me devil, dears--call me devil!" "If you know aught of Linkhorn, I beg of you to tell me,'- said Ruby, impressed by his words and manner. I  "I know nothing, sweets. I'm a crab-a sea-spider--a polypus! Keep back there, , Craw!"Then to Ruby: "Why should I , spend my short breath in talklng? You don't believe me. The Three Dials and the Woman's Head stand opposite." He lowered his Voice: ' Ajax Bransom is a devil, and L Craw is a deviT, and you can call me devil. r But I am a different kind0 of devil. They are i subtle devils, and I'm a climbin' devil. I am rub, Grub, Grb, Grubl Back, back, back! I come and I go, above and below, and none of, ' you know how I come and I go. Yo-ho I yo- ho!" 3  "I wish," said Ruby, entreatingly, " that 1 you would speak to the point. I -am per- I suaded that you know something that con- cerns us. What is it?" "You won't hear-you won't understand!" "he cried, fiercely. "Because my arms are long, my head large, and my legs short, you ; think I'm a fool. Would you be a fool if - your arms reached below your knees? I told e you to go home; you scorn to yield obedi* y ence to a dwarf. It is now too late. Yonder   comes Dare Cutlook and Orloff Shillinglaw. Fine names! Perhaps they are soldiers of fortune I Perhaps nobody lives and nobody dies at the will of one or the other of them I Perhaps there's no Tower in London I Per- haps there's no Whitehall, no King- Charles, no river Thames!  When next we. meet, where will it be? Call me devil, dears. Yo. ho I yo-ho!" Grub pointed with. his long arm, and wheel- ed out of sight in a moment. CHAPTER XI. BETRAYED., The girls looked in the direction indicated by the dwarf, and saw two persons approach- ing them from the Fields. "To Queen street! to Queen street!" ar- ticulated Ruby, hurriedly. "Nay, my mistress," said Kibbie, running to her. "I am sure there is no danger. That little wretch is a malignant liar! Let' us pur- sue our way as if we owned every inch of London. Who dares interfere with the watch- maker's daughter while walking modestly and staidly the king's highway? God bless him!" .  "iNo one will be so presumptuous! cried one of the advancing persons, and immediately Dare Cutlock stepped before them. "1 it thee, my Ruby? Thou art rightly called, being indeed a precious jewel. Among all the jewels of thy father, sweet maiden, there is not one I covet so much." The young girl had never heard a voice so easy, assured, and courtly--save at the Bar- ley Mow. "Stand aside, sir, and permit me to pass," she said, perceptibly agitated. "There is scarcely a look of thine thlat would not enforce obedience upon Dare Cut- look; but leave thee, I will not. By those -faint stars, girl, I love thee 1" "I ask it not-I desire it not. I but ask to be freed from this annoyance. Go, my lord, and make love elsewhere." "The fair are ever cruel. Is it not so, good Orloff?" said Cutlock. "I can answer you more definitely when I have heard what this damsel will say to a word I am about to speak," replied Shilling- law. "If that word be what I suspect, I will spare you the trouble," interposed Margaret, coldly. "Upon my word!" exclaimed Orloff, " we find here what we seldom discover at the courts of kings-modesty." "Let us turn back!" whispered Ruby. "I shall have the rudeness to object," said Cutlock. "You will -you must hear my suit. Listen to one who is able to perform all he promises. Go with me. AI will give you   love, and ease, and riches. I will make you the envied of your sex." "I spurn your offer, my lord I', "Margaret of the Barley Mow," said Shil- linglaw,. "I say to you what this noble gentle- man has said to the watchmaker's daughter. Be not so insensible as she." ' You waste time," answered Margaret, with disdain.          -  , "If you have riches and honors to bestow, noble sirs, give them to those who aspire to', such gifts. Our aims are humbler. Let me most positively assure you that you are ex- posing yourselves to the night-air in vain ; that you flatter in vain; that you smile in vain; that in vain you hold out dazzling ex- pectations." Ruby -spoke with grace and dignity. Her value grew incalculably in the estimation of Dare Cutlock. The diamond that he coveted shone resplendently. He bit his lip. A slight blush suffused his cheeks. "Girl," he replied, " you are infelicitous in your resistance ; for I swear to you, that your virtuous opposition but spurs me on." "Yield!" whispered Craw Kibbie in Ruby's ear. "You say nay to one who cannot be denied." "Awnay temptress!" retorted her mistress. Then to Cutlock: "We are but simple maidens. Love we have not; it is already bestowed. You have wrung from me the confession. If you have wife, or daughter, or sister, in their sacred names I commannd you to give way!" , She waved a white and authoritative hand. Cutlook seemed staggered. "It is well said, upon my life! I would to God there were any retreat in evill But there is not. There is but one path, and that is onward." "I perceive that you are a man of rank," resumed Ruby. "Prostitute not your talent and greatness. Remember that guilty plea- sures are evanescent. Bear in mind that the fruit turns to ashes in the mouth, and repent- ance is bitter." "By the king's crown I You are a saint. Be- fore Heaven, I will not lose a saint!" "We will see!t we will see!" cried a voice that thrilled the maidens. An athletic figure, in a mask of white and black, emerged from, the shadow of a tree, and unsheathing his sword, planted the point upon the ground before Cutlock. It was Nightshade, the mys- terious terror of the road. For a moment there was a singular tableau on Lincoln's Inn Fields. Cutlock was the first to speak. "Who dares interpose?" he haughtily de- manded. "I dare!"              t "Insolent!" muttered Cutlock.   "I stand here the chainm o:l of ,l,.uoc.... answered Nightshade. "' My sword is ready, and I will make good my cause with my body. Advance one or both." "This surpasses my patience!" replied Cutlock, deliberately drawing his weapon. We met before at a disadvantage ; but now on different footing." "Hold!" cried Shillinglaw, much disturbed. "I Hold, Sir Robber I You know not the height of your presumption. You' know not-" a' Have a care!" interrupted Cutlock. "Be- tray me not to this daring caitiff," ' My lord! my lord i" stammered Orloff. "Peace, good Orloff. My sword shall be bulwark and safety. . There is but one 'man in England that knows the use of the. weapon better."  "The Duke of Monmouth!" sneered Night- shade.  "You are right; Monmouth is the man," said Cutlock. "Go, sir, go! Save your head till another time.- There are five hundred guineas on it. Begone, with your mask of white and black.". "There is but one who can take my head," answered Nightshade, calmly, "and that is the king." "The common hangman will spare his ma- jesty the trouble," said Shillinglaw.  Thou liest i" "The lie to me!" vociferated Shillinglaw. "Stand aside, my lord, and let me punish this audacity." "I yield my place to no one," returned Cutlook, resolutely. "Villain! prepare to de- fend your life." Cutlookl;planted his left foot behind him, and put himself in a posture of attack. "Pause one moment, my lord," said Night- shade. "I aim not at your sacred life. I am but the simple champion of these maidens, and intend to do no more than is necessary for their safety. If they are permitted to go in peace, I sheathe my sword." "I make not terms with a meddler. Or- loff, look to the damsels. Robber, have a care of that forfeit body!" Their weapons met. The clear ring of steel smote the air. In the duskiness the strife commenced and went on with vigor. In the feeble starlight their faces looked grim and stern, as they thrust, and parried, and tried each other's skill. It was not long be- fore Cutlock perceived that he was ,engaged with an adversary of'no ordinary stamp. It was in-vain that he endeavored to break his guard, and end the contest with a decisive blow. Nightshade was not to be surprised nor betrayed by the feints and dangerous finesse of steel. He met the assaults of Cutlock with self-possession, and defended his person with ease.   l1uby and Margaret would have taken ad- vantage of this rencontre, and retired to the Three Dials, had not Orloff Shillinglaw prevented their flight. "The birds must not escape while my lord is shaking the bush," he said. "Since you are costing us so much trouble, it would be unfair to run .away." He placed himself before them, and blew a silver whistle. The circumstance, of blowing the whistle struck them as being so suspicious, that their embarrassment, andj fears'were much increas- ed. Craw Kibbie, with the ostensible purpose of aiding them, pertinaciously, in her seem- ing paroxysms of terror, placed herself in positiomls to encumber their movements, throwing her arms now around her mistress, and now around Margaret, giving vent to lit- tle cries, and imploring them to keep her from being carried off by the wicked cava- liers. These things were done very adroitly- on the part of the maid; so that Ruby was really inclined to the belief that her previbus doubt had done her injustice. - Meantime, Dare Cutlock, vexed with the cool play of his antagonist, pressed upon him with more heat, and brought into requisition the master-points of - his knowledge; yet with no more success than at the beginning. While matters were in this position, Dyce Hungerford, the watchmaker's apprentice, reached the spot, bareheaded, out of breath, and with a staff in his hand about the length of a rapier. Taking in the scene at a glance, he ran at Shillinglaw impetuously, dealing him a blow on the head that beat him to the earth. :   . "Cowards! villains!" he cried. "Cannot the young women of London step into the streets, after nightfall, without being badger- ed and-insulted by dissolute gallants?" Shillinglaw sprang from the earth, burning with rage.   - "Have at you, base clown! How dare you meddle with the sports of gentlemen?" His sword was out in an instant, antd flash- ing about the head of Hungerford who, with his staff, withstood the furious onet. Cutlock and Nightshade paused, and, lean- ing on their swords, eyed each other inquisi- tively. 6"You have a firm hand, and a skillful," said Cutlock. "' It seems a thousand pities that. such a hero should die by the halter." "I hope better things, noble sir. There is no hemp seed in thie kingdom that will con- tribute a single sprout for a rope for him of the White and Black,": replied Nightshade, with composure. "Who comes here? A new interruption, by my soul! Orloff is down. Gad's life  That is hard on Orloff. The tide of our love   goes roughly. More fighting. A staff to a sword! By my halidom I I believe all the robbers and apprentices in the kingdom have fencing at their fingers' ends! Put up your sword, champion of maidens. Here come those who will cut the kn t of this difficulty."' Ruby and Margaret, being relieved from Shillinglaw by the coming of the apprentice, immediately set off for the Three Dials, but were so embarrassed by the frantic conduct of Craw Kibbie, that they made but indiffer- ent progress. Seeing a lumbering vehicle ap- proaching, drawn by four horses, they broke from the maid, and ran toward it, crying for assistance The horses were at once stopped, and a man jumped from the carriage with alacrity. "Who calls for help?" he demanded. Then seeing the two girls advancing as fast as they could, he added: "Help? 'Fore God, you shall have -it  Into the carriage, young women, and fear nothing. Pursued by some insolent gallant, I dare say?"     "Yes," said Ruby, mechanically. They flew into the vehicle like startled birds, and sank trembling among the cush- ions.      '  "Cease to flutter," said the man. "Cease to flutter, my birdies! You are so safe here, that there is but one man in the kingdom can reach you, and that is the king." He entered the carriage while speaking, and the heavy door was closed by another hand. The horses started at a brisk pace. "This is a state carriage!" said Ruby, du- biously, passing her hand over the velvet lin- ings. "So much the better," replied Margaret. "This gentleman may be one who has interest with the king. I am sure his majesty will punish such outrages." Their protector laughed, and remarked:  "Monarchs are not above the weaknesses of i other men." "Plense, my lord, for you must be one in 1 authority, set us down at the Three Dials, at Red Lion street," faltered Ruby.     1 "The king's business requires haste. On ] my return, young ladies, my pleasure will be ] to consult yours. If you can tolerate my i poor company for a space, you shall have no 1 reason to complain of discourtesy."    "We are going very fast," said Margaret. i "This alarms me i"           I "We will go slower, anon. Trust the dri- ver's skill; 'he is inimitablie."  The clumsy vehicle rumbled on. The girls { could catch glimpses, through the windows, of i houses and streets flying past them. They 1 sat clasping. each other's hands, Margaret Ihapplay in the thought of escape, and Ruby a doubtful.                t A .   The rock. and roll of the carriage ceased; it stopped. The door was opened. "Alight!" said their protector. The girls obeyed with somer hesitation, and found themselves standing by the Thames. "The remainder of our journey will be per- formed by water," added their unknown friend. "Please descend these steps to the barge." '"That will be pleasant!" exelaimed Mar- garet, and girlishy ran down the steps into the barge. Ruby, with many misgivings, fol- lowing. She could not but notice the rich- ness of the barge, its crimson canopy at one end, the costly stuffs which lined it, and the luxuriance of all its appointments. They sat down where they were bidden, and the barge shot off, propelled by two athletic rowers., ' "You tremble!" whispered  Margaret.' "What ails you?" "This looks like one of the royal- barges. Margaret, my cousin, we are betrayed!" she answered, much agitated. ",My heart begins to throb. What will happen?" "Heaven knows!   otice the fittings of this barge; see these satins and velvets, these gold and silver laces; the gilded carvings; in short, the luxuriousness of the whole. This is too royal. Margaret, we are-lost I In fly- ing from the leopard, we have rushed into the lion's mouth." "Blind! blind I I might have seen it be- fore. Look at that man, Ruby." "Look at him? I cannot look away from him. His bland and smiling face, as the dim light falls on it, strikes me with dread. Why do we shoot shoreward? The Tower! the Tower! We are heading toward the Tower!" "The Tower of London!" gasped Marga- ret, ghastly with fear. "Yes," replied Ruby, " and my heart tells me that it is our destination. We shall enter it by the Traitor's Gate. We are already be- neath the. bridge. It's a bad omen to enter the Tower of London by water." "Speak to that person. End this uncer- tainty. See the singular significance upon his lips." The innkeeper's daughter pressed. Ruby's amin so hard, that under other circum- stances, she would have cried out with pain; but, the mind, in states of excitement, dead- ens the sensibility of the body. The fanatic is sometimes impervious to torture, and ter- ror of moral evil often has the same effect. "I will; I will address him, let what may come of it. -Sir," she raised her voice, and gave him her flushed face, so faras it was vis- ible in the shadow of the Tower and the mis- tiness of the night, " avow your purpose." The barge touched the steps of St. Thom- as' Tower. Their conductorarose., The speo- tre of a smile lay quietly on'his lips.   ". So far as I am concerned, fair ladies, I may say that I leave no purpose other than to treat you with consideration."  Two attendants, standing on the stone steps, took hold of the barge and drew it to them horizontally, and held it steady to make-land- ing safe and easy. "Call us not ladies," answered Ruby. "We are not of the fashionable and titled. Speak us plainly, and to. the point. Are we here by accident or by design? If by the first, take us hence, I entreat of you; if by the second, let our distress move you." The man pointed to the steps. "Here we leave ,the :barge," he replied. "Permit me t oassist you over the side. Our way lies through this gate. Be not alarmed. You are not for the torture nor the block." "I wish we were.!" exclaimed Ruby, indig- nation mingling with her fear. Their conductor elevated his brows incred- ulously.  ;     '      ' / "It is far easier," he said, with a sneer, " to' be something .sweeter than a criminal.. You maidens, whatever your condition, know well the arts of coquetry. Not a shop-keeper in London knows better how to enhance the price of his wates than your over-modest damsels -theirs." He extended his hand to assist them to the steps; but, scorning it, the girls sprang from the barge unaided. "Spare me, gentle ones, all that is maud- lin. I am sick of sentiment. If Wringing of hands could move me, I should be melted every day; if tears could soften, I :should be more elastic than water; if the agony of despair could shake my soul, I should be tossed like a cloud in a whirlwind," he answered, with a severe expression of countenance. .' "One would think," replied;Ruby, shrink- ing from him, " that you were the infamous Judge Jeffreys himself, whose hardness of heart has passed into a proverb." "Ho! hol" he retorted, contracting his face into an angry grimace. "'Talk the rab- ble in that fashion? Dare they presume to criticise their betters? The wretches!"'.' "Rather say the wretch," returned Ruby, strongly repelled from this sneering and un- sympathizing personage. "He shall be informed of what you say of him," he said, harshy. "As he is hand and glove: with the king, you may possibly feel his influence." "Why should such a monster be in: favor with King Chatles P" asked Ruby, involun- tarily. The gate of St. Thomas' Tower had swung open. . The man turned on the worn and grimy threshold, and darting a cold and haughty look at Ruby, responded:  J      "For the best of all reasons: Because he panders to his pleasures." "God help his majesty!" They passed on between a dozen arquebus- siers, who presented arms. Two link-boys, who stood in. two recesses, stepped before them, bearing long torches of tow and pitch. "Tell me," said Ruby, " your name, that I may remember, when I am shamed and lost, the wretch that betrayed me to my ruin?" The man impatiently waved his hand for the link-boys to go faster. "Mistress! mistress!" he retorted. "You have sharp arrows under your tongue. You have either less wit or more courage than you ought to have. I am one unused to bantering and baiting, and I always have the last word. And such words! Watchmaker's' daughter, my words are death!" "' To me," returned Ruby-, "your looks are death."  With quick instinct, she had caught an in- sight into his character, and determined to provoke him to a discovery of his name and rank. "To kill me, you would not need an axe; your inhuman face would suffice." "Axe! God's life! Do you take me for the headsman?" he voeiferated,.white with rasre. "Such was my thought. And to tell the truth, you greatly resemble the prints I have  seen of that odious creature." One of the link-boys smiling at that instant, he threatened to throw him from a window into the moat. "I am Sir George Jceffreys," he yelled, "Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench!" This announcement staggered Ruby like a buffet with a mailed hand. There was not a man in the kingdom whose name, had more terror for her. The thought of the Old Bailey, and the terrible scenes daily enacted there. His love of cruelty was well known. ' He had' a monomania for Death. In the halls of so- called justice, his voice was the watehword of fear. His course reeked with tears and blood. Bridewell and the cart's tail, halters and Ty- burn, were his pastimes. The soul of the monster had. turned to rock. Margaret felt Ruby trembling and slipping from her arm. "Courage, darling, courage We will get the ear of the king, and he will snatch us 'from this blood-bloat. How I pity the woman who gave birth to such a moral deformity! I had rather be mother to Grub, the dwarf." 4"My'name is Grub, Grub, Grub!" screech- ed the very monstrosity whom Margaret had mentioned. , It appeared to the poor girl that the little blot was an imp, with the power of ubiquity. He came along the long, dark passage turning - summersets.   "Call me devil, dears; call me devil!"  "Out of the way,-toad!" cried Jeffreys. "Watch a toad and he will swell up as big as an ox," chuckled Grub. "I'll swell, I'll warrant, so that you can't get over me. Toad, toasI, toad! I like that. Ill be the biggest in the puddle. Ho-hlo! 'Ho-h\6! I don't swim in your. puddle, though. You croak at the Old Bailey; I croak at the Tower. Ow! ow! ow!" The Grub croaked like a toad. "You'll croak down in the dungeons be- fore long, you lizard, you earwig, you beetle!" menaced Jeffreys. -"Give us more bear-garden and Billings- gate. Go on, go'on, go on!' Call me bug, worm, louse, mole. You are grub inside, and I'ni grub outside. We're both monsters. How d'ye do, brother? Call me brother!" !"I'll call the gua'rd and have you shot from one of the guns in yonder embrasures," said Jeffreys, biting his lips with chagrin. "You don't sentence folks here. The word of one Charles Stuart has a deal to do with the house-keeping hereabouts. He makes and unmakes judges. He takes off heads' in a jiffy., He's a devil of a fellow, this Charles. Oho! Oho!" , Grub sprang at one of, the link-boys and caught the link from his hand. " Come on. Follow, follow, follow?" he cried. "Beware how you interfere, you long arm- ed blotch!" growled Jeffreys, out of whose reach the dwarf was careful to keep. "I hve orders as well as you. I act under authority. Disobey Gentleman Charles, if you dare! iHe is stronger here than you at the Old Bailey among thieves, and harlots, and felons." Jeffreys drew a  large and clumsy pistol from beneath his doublet-one of the /wk- warid efforts of the period at thiat kind of arm -and  quivering with passion, cocked it, swearing, with a vulgar oath, that he would.: make an end of him, if it cost him his high office. Grub held up a  ring. "Before you fire, brother, consider this toy."  Jeffreys, muttering, replaced his weapon. e "If the -king has such insects in his service, honorable men will cease to serve him, anon. ] All. my  monster! -if I could have you but 1 ten minutes at the Old Bailey!"  -    1 "  You'd give me the scum of the fish-mark- et, and a  mention in the records of Tyburn,  no doubt. But eome on with your pretties. 1 We   Want delicacies at the Tower. As the 1 king's favorite, I have an interest in these t matters. Ha, hal Ha, ha  !"      1 "Hear this slug!"God give me patience' 1 Wenches, we must needs follbw him." During this singular confabulation the    parties had been moving slowly through a time-worn hall in the direction of the White Tower. The grime of the stone floor, the grime of the walls, and the grime of the dark arches, filled the maidens with mysteriobus dread, The Three Dials and the Barley Mow,' Dyee Huagerford and Christy Rirk, and the associations of home and kindred, pressed upon -their memories with overwhelming force.        .  "  My name is Grub! Grub! Grub!" chant- ed the dwarf, swinging his torch fantastically above his head. The girls clasped each other for support. The- damips and the traditions of the Tower were on them. -They pondered upon the feet that had walked thbse passages, that were now dust and ashes, mould and corruption. What to them were the jealousies of kings, the struggles of heroes, and the dying throes of ambition'? There was something dearer than all these. CHAPTER- XII. THE TOWER. They reache'd an iron gateway, guarded by two ialberdiers. From this Grub turned to the right, and traversing a long corrid6r, de- scended some stone steps. "Are you leading us to the vaults?" asked Ruby, w   io, having recovered, in a nmeasure, from the first shock of terror, made good use of her eyes. To yield to tears and lamenta- tions, she realized would be of no avail; but to maintain her courage, and cheer her com- panion, would be wise and prudent. "Why not to the vaults?" said' Jeffreys, with a sinister glance.  "What choice can you presume to have? Think you to be en- tertained less comfortably than at the watch- maker's?"  "I did not address you, Sir 'George, but yonder type of your soul." Ruby felt that, like the bee captured and held in a relentless hand, she had the privilege ot stinging, and would not forego it. "Young women," he answered, falling back beside them, and depressing his voice, " you have made, this night, an uncompromising enem.      .  '"Enemy'? You    are the enemy of the race!  I have heard such tales of your ferocity that your friefidship would alarm me more than your hate," replied Ruby. "Be it so!" muttered Jeffreys. "I will en- deavor to see you, fair creatures, when you leave this Tower. You will be- so humble, that you will thank any tradesman or artisan to take away your' reproachi. You would let him step on you, who would afterward lift you up.   ' As Jeffreys stooped toward the maidens, with the 'torchght shimmering on his pale   and mocking face, he looked the prophet of evil.                  o "'Say no more!" cried Ruby. "You chill a my blood. May Heaven order that we never sa meet'again."              g ' I know more of you," continued Jeffreys, r "than you- think. By the authority of one I o will not name, I have made inquiries concern- f ingthe inmates of the Three Dials, and the M Barley Mow. I could mention two maidens who have lovers. -I could. call those lovers by I name. Ahl that brings the color to your e cheeks. I have toucheda chord that vibrates. I Know you where my vengeance will fall?" e "This man is pitiless8 " murmured Mar- s garet.                 t "What think you Mistress Mallows, of the m new apprentice? What hope should you  have of him, should he come to the Old Bai-  ley to taste my tender mercies?"    t "Grub I Grub! Have we much farther to  go?" asked Ruby, shivering.       "We are at our journey's end," answered the dwarf. "With this, key I unlock this 3 door. See me do it. Go in go in! go in!"'  "Daughter of the Barley Mow," quoth Jef- freys, maliciously, "there is a rude clown hight Christy Kirk, who has made himself too officious for the pleasure of one who will not take nay for an answer. If he should some- time findl lis way down into the Rat Dungeon I Such things have happened, and may again. As for Dyce Hungeriford "--he fixed his cold and glittering eyes on Ruby--" he is my ene- my, and I will pursue him with all the craft and cruelty of which I am capable." "Perhaps, Sir George,". answered Ruby, after a moment's reflection ," I may find means to thwart your intentions." "To thwart your intentions," repeated Grub. "To thwart your intentions. Hear! hear!" "; Silence, ape!" bellowed Jeffreys. Once more fastening his freezing eyes on tuby, he added, with perceptible uneasiness: "You are thinking of the king. Build not yourshopes too high in that quarter. H may be hcated and feared by the people, but I am needful to his majesty. And now allow me this parting advice: Speak not of me and this singular interview, as you value the safety of your fri!.nds,and kindred." ,  The young woman made no answer, but entered the apartment to which Grub pointed' "Call me-devil, dears Safe, sate, safe! How safe you'll be'!' Don't be cast down. You are going to set up the. business of great ladies. When you're able to give gifts and reward merit, don't forget, Grub." The dwarf claned back the heavy door, and shot the complaining bolt into the socket. They he lrd Jeffreys demand the key; Grub cast it upon the floor, and ran away.   Left to themselves, Ruby and Margaret had opportunity to collect, their disorded faculties and take notice of their surrroundings. In- stead of being the occupants of a dismal dun- geon, they were in a room of ample size, luxu- riouslyfurnished. This circumstance, instead of allaying their. fears, increased them, con- firming, as it did, those natural instincts which their abduction had aroused. Seeing a door at one side of the apartment, Margaret opened it, not with any ex pectation of escape, but half mechanically. It was a bed-chamber, with rich appointments. An exclamation of surprise brought Ruby to her side. Their white hands spontaneously met; they clung to each other as if their only hope was in companionship. Both felt what they dared not utter. That Dyce Hungerford and Christy Kirk mingled with their reflections, there can be no doubt. They thought of the despair and distraction of their lovers, and the vain search that would be made; the long, painful, weary search. The time might speed- ily come when they would pray that that Search would be forever abortive. They turned from the gilded couch to a further survey of their prison. Both apart- ments were lighted by iron lamps suspended from the ceiling. There were pictures on the walls. An antique case, in a niche, was filled with books. Several stringed instruments lay in a confused heap in a corner. Wherever they turned their eves, they beheld evidences of taste and refinement. Margaret, less cour- ageous than her cousin, would hnve yielded to despondency and passed the time in weep- ing; but the latter cheered her by every plausible art. To divert her mind, she called her attention to three portraits of women of remarkable beaaty. The first, whose loveli- ness was marvelous, had silken hair that curled around her exquisite head in short ringlets. The sweetness and vivacity of the face, together with the perfection of the neck and bust, made the girls, for a moment, for- ; getful of themselves. r "In person," said Ruby, "she is faultless. i It is Nell Gwynn. I have seen her, and this o does her no more than justice. Poor Nell! I she accepts her fate." r   "But who is this?"Margaret pointed to a second picture, representing a, woman fair as a saint, but of a different style of beauty. "I know not," replied Ruby. "Another ! unfortunate, doubtless, dazzled by the pres- tige of a monarch." t  "It may be the infamous Lady Castle- i maine, whose intimacy with the king is in everybody's mouth," said Margaret. d  " think you are right," said Ruby, with ;. a sigh. "God keep us from such honor!" b  While the watchmaker's daughter was speak- ing, the picture, to their astonishment, began   slowly to descend to the floor, and the face of the original, pale and angry, appeared above it. The girls stood motionless with awe and wonder. This tableau lasted but an instant; the wall opened, the picture rolled inward out of sight, and a woman, richly attired, con- fronted them. She did not speak immediate- ly, but with her superb head erect, flashed upon them witheringly with her magnificent eyes.    " "Wantons!" she-cried. "Wantons!" The words seemed to burn her lips, they came forth so hot and scorching. Ruby and Margaret drew back a little. "How dare ye come hither?" -she added, with a sweep of her jeweled hand. "Madam  madam " stammered Ruby. "Forbearl" hissed the lady. "Presume not to speak to me.- Harlot! harlot " "'Tis false!" gasped Ruby, with a glow of womanly pride, and a sudden inspiration of face and form that greatly enhanced her beau- ty. "This to me, most shameless How came you here? Who brought you? What bau- ble have you received in exchange for your virtue?" An. angry sneer curled the lady's lips. "Hear me, woman!" cried Ruby. "Hear you? That will not I! I came not to parley with wantons. Bitterly shall you pay for this audacity." "Before Heaven, lady, I am here by no good-will of my own. My prayer to God is to get away in safety. Woman! woman! I am not what you have called me. Look at us; we are maidens of common degree. We have been shamefully betrayed and brought hither, by whose authority we know not. If you have power to take us hence, we will, in very gratitude, kiss the hem of your robes, and weary the saints with our prayers for your happiness." -The haughty brow and face softened. She was silent a brief space. "I have but your word for it," she said, presently. "Put me to any proof you will," implored Ruby. "If you have daughter or sister-" "Away with sentiment! I hate it. Bah l Do you think I am old enough to have grown daughters? Whom have you seen?" "Since coming to this miserable place, no. one. God avert our seeing any one-except your ladyship, in whom, under Heaven, we put our trust. You have a heart; one so lovely cannot be destitute of feeling. Lady, beautiful lady"-Ruby knelt, and clasped the white, jeweled hand--" have divine pity on two maidens, who desire to preserve that one gift which God has given them." "What would you have?" asked the lady, in a milder tone.   "Release! release from the Tower, and safety at home. Turn not away; I know you; you have power with the king. You are Lady Castlemaine." ' Silly creature I You deceive me. What right have you to know me? But it what you say be true, I may be inclined to grant your wishes. Have you been honored with courtly wooers of late?" "No," replied the girl,reflectively. "Thank the saints, we have been free of profligate gal- lants. Two adventurers, only, lfave presum- ed to address us improperly." "Who were those adventurers?" asked the lady, eagerly. "Dare Cutlock and Orloff Shillinglaw were  the names by which they' were called," re- plied Ruby, watching the countenance of the iroperious woman. "How long since you have seen them?" she demanded. Ruby related the manner of their meeting at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and what subsequent- ly occurred. "And have you not connected these cava- liers with the'termination of the adventure?" "Our minds have been so disturbed, your ladyship, that we have not been able to think clearly," Ruby replied. "You wish me to understand that you are entirely ignorant of the rank of the person or persons by whose authortity you were brought to the Tower?" "I do!" said Ruby, with fervor. "I am disposed to credit this, improbable as it is. It will be well for you, and those who love you, if it be so." She searched the countenances of both to see if falsehood lurked in them, but could find nothing save blushing modesty and innocent beauty. Footsteps were heard echoing in the long passage. Lady Castlemaine listened to them with changing color. "I will soon test your truthfulness," she said. "You are about to have a visitor. I will hide behind the arras in that room. I shall hear what may be said. If you have deceived me, tremble! If you have declared the truth, in me you will find a friend."  She passed into the bed-chamber, and con- cealed herself behind the heavy draperies. This was scarcely effected, when the door was unlocked, and a man, wearing a mask, entered. Having contemplated the girls a moment, he removed the mask, disclosing the features of Dare Cutlock. Knowing that they were not alone, the young women were of good courage. "Fair maidens," he said, "I'll wager my' sword that you scarcely expected to see Dare Cutlock again to-night?" "A safe wager," answered Ruby; " and I   have to add, that I hope we shall be favored with his company no longer than it is agree. able to us." "Then I flatter myself that I shall not leave you for an hour," responded Cutl'cek, with a graceful bow.       ' . "On the contrary, sir, you;will, in- that event, leave us at once ;. fot assure you that you are most unwelcome." "Am I then so odious." Pt "To us, sir, your presence brings ,fear and dread. If you have teen' instruiental itn this outrage upon our liberties; I: leg of you to repent the injustice, and' restorie uis to our friends. If you do this, I am sure' God will reward, the action ; for I feel confident that, sooner or later, it will reach'the ears of the king." "The king, it is said, has his dgallantries. Rely not too much on: him. He is'a clham- pion in the lists of love." "The king may have bad counselors; but at heart he is a gracious monarch."-- "I will not dispute you, fair Ruby,1' said Cutlock, laughing, "for I' love the king as I love no other man. I know the moods of Charles. There are times, no doubt, when he is magnanimous ; but put Beauty before him, and he is as human as I." - "I will not think ill of my sovereign. He loves the queen, although it is rumored that Lady Castlemaine has a strong ascendancy over his mind." "I'll dispute thee in nothing; not' even in the nmatter of Lady Castlemaine, who is a very charming woman, though her face is scarcely equal to thine." -       ' He approached Ruby for the purpose of taking her hand, but she retreated from him. "Thou hast youth," he added, "but. she has passed the noon of her glory, and is de- scending into her evening. It were mot well that the king should see' thee. Simple' Dare Outlock would have little to hope if brought into rivalry with Charles Stuart."  "Your audacity not: only -shames but an- gers me 1!' exclaimed Ruby. "You offer your illicit love to one most scornful of it.' I meet your insidious advances with inexpressible disdain. Know, licentious cavalier, that I will not' survive dishonor I I will die in defence of my integrity. ' At the worst, 'this shall de- fend me." She drew a dagger from her bo- som ; it was long, sharp, and polished like a mirror. Dare Outlook eyed her an instaiit, and took two or three turns across the apartment. "So you reject honor and riches?" he said, musingly.  I reject everything that is the price of shame!" retorted Ruby, with dignity. Margeret heard a rustling behind the dra-   peries. Something had made Lady Castle- maine start. . Cutldck drew nearer. "What," he said, in'a whispered voice, " if -I come to-you in behalf of the king?" "I should. bid: you return to his majesty and say '-The crown of a-monarch is Jus- :tice, the coownn of a maiden is Virtue ; and neither are to be bartered.'"  ' "'You are a little moralist," answered Cut- lock, uneasily. 'He addressed Marg aret:  "Daughter of the innkeeper, are-you, too, over-serupulous? Shall -my friend Orloff sigh, in vain:?" "My cousin-has spoken my own sentiments; could I'add to their force by any expression, I would hasten to do so. I shrink from this unjustifiable'aggre'sion of the humanities of, life, with abhorrence and indignation. Had you that. generosity of soul which should ac- company a countenance so noble and a port so courtly, you would throw off at once your unmaaly disguise, and no longer seek the de- struiction of two poor girls far beneath your station, yet abqoe your bribes. Go. sir, and be as royal a gentleman in disposition as you- seem in person. Witness our distress; note these tears; hear these sighs. Think of our fathers and our lovers. Picture to yourself, their grief, should we go back to them de- spoiled and humiliated:" "No more, pretty saint!" interrupted Cut- lock. "The citadel that you defend grows more precious in my eyes, as you proceed. Resistance sharpens desire, while mod, sty charms and adorns that which yon struggle to retain. Sweet damsels, you will find us inex- orable." "If we cannot move ypour pity. we can at least baffle your unholy design," interposed Ruby. "We' will'not be separated." 'Outlock looked serious,- and ,turned to de- part.   .   ... "Rest in peace till morning," he said. * Let reflection bring complaisance. Be not nicer than court ladies', who scorn not to be wooed and won. Hwould take you from your low podsition, anid- plac'e you in a resplendent circle. Adieui, maidens! May rosy slumbers visit-you."  Kissing his hand to Ruby and Margaret, he left their presence,' and they heard the key giate 'in the lock. CHAPTER XIII. ' THE DUNGEONS OF THE TOWER. The young woman stood looking at the door through which their visitor had disap- peared, listening to his receding steps. Lady Castlemaine came from behind the draperies, pale and agitated. "It is the fate of mortals," she said, " not only to be deceived. buit to injure the inno-   centf Your, tale was true, Poor, fluttering, creatures! If pity were the fashion among ladies; of rank, I Should pit. you.

She: paused, then added: 'Sa. theat was Dare Cutlock?"She tossed her head and smiled, dfiisitelyv . w "Eas,?' sid Ruby, impressed by her man- ner.   Si'ty eeatures 1" she went on. "Are your -eyea so dark and brilliant, yetso blind? The Emn has just loft you!". "The;k ng  exc laimed the girls, recoiling. "Charles, of England!" said Lady Castle- maine, with a scarlet flusiB of the cheeks. "Charles of England!" repeated Ruby, triekel with amazement. "I suspeoted him a nobleman, but I looked not so high as the Kinagu" S"-So you repent your firmness?" cried Lady Castlemaine, almost fiercely. " No, yonladyshqip no t I would not beg", gar my good name for a thousand kings. I IeT, lad1y, I love t Ah! one so charming as you ladyship must know what love is." "To, well too well asall Englandiknows," "Ca^  yom tell me, your ladyship," said Margaret, ' who may be this Shillinglaw, the king's fribnd- ' " I now, girl, wlo panders to his royal appetite.

"My cousin, meant not to offend," said Margaret. T- here is but one who ean save you, and that is not Catherine of BUpt^s , It; is your ladyship t I know that you bold the king in your hand,' responded Ru- by with earnestness. "4 knw. not that!

"A myriad' of bTessiigs on your dear lady, shipl" they 'cried. "May your high position matea ou always hagpp! The prayers of two grateftl maidens shal' fOllow' you in your sweet libations wherever you go, through. the long road of life down to the silence and ashes of the grave.' Lady Castlemaine was moved. "Forbear, simple ones, forbear! The mo- tive for this action will not pass for the cur- rent coin of charity into the treasury of God. Had I your innocence, 1 doubt if I should not be something better than-than-" She stoppe d'  "I will iend' a trusty person to conduct you hence.  Him follow 'without question.

It is not' often that one escapes from a king; especially a king who has a ds- solute eourp biut to willing to gratify his caprices."' "Your counsel shall be faithfully adhered to," Ruby answered. ".Faewell! May' your fWtes. be humbler and happier than mine!" Lady' astlemaine stepped lightly and qtick- ly behind them, touchdc a spring in the wall, and disappeared. When they turrnedto look after hel, the picture had rettrned to it plaee. The hour Was ehangedinto gladness. They embraced esah other. Hope lifted them above desiie. Rescue Was no longer among the impo sibilities.. They waited-for the moment of aeliverane, while evey distant sound was the signal for a beart-throd of expectation. They watched the wall, thinking to seea it open for their flight. An hour elapsed before any one eame; then the:door. was cautiously unlockedt and opened. A figure, masked and cloaked to the feet, entered. He bore in one hand a torch, in the other a' bunch of keys. - He made a gesture for the girls to follow and when they hac&.passed into the corridor, closed the door and locked it. T'his way, and tead' oftly f" he whisper- ed. - With these brief words, he turned from the main hall or corridor into s narrow pas-   sages and walked briskly forward. At the end of this passage, he lifted a trap-door by an iron ring, and began to descend.' Ruby paus- ed, holding by her companion, then, with a shiver, went on. The steps were wet and slippery; it required some care totread them safely. The floor to which these steps con-, ducted was of stone, dark and moist. It was a part of the Tower evidently less frequented than that they had left. Therewas that cold, still breath pervading it that tells one he is underground, below the influences of light and heat. The cloaked form strode on, his blazing link hissing and sputtering in the damps. Their dismal walk was between a succession of dun- geon doors that gave them ho -cheerful im- pressions of the place. Leaving these sug-. gestive objects, at length, enother trap was raised and another flight of steps, still less in- viting, disclosed. "T'm afraid!" whispered Margaret. "These vaults are very frightful. My confidence in our guide is failing."  Ruby pressed her cousin's arm and drew ( her forward, although not without misgivings.  Mouldering, ancient odors fumed against their * nostrils. Pent-up gases rushed in a cold cur- E rent through  the trap, making the torch burn dim and blue. Their guide waved them s on with the flickering link. "Who is he?' Who is this silent man?" queried Margaret.            i "Let us hope that every step takes us ] nearer to those that love us," answered Ruby, 1 in an icy whisper.  "I reel vour heart beat, Ruby; it throbs  fearfully under my hand.  Confess that you i are chilled with terror!'        1 "T cannot'deny nmymisgivings.  The very E stones reek and sweat wth horror! The flags  beneath us are. glairy with tears. Unhappy f gihoats might walk here through the days of i their purgatory, flying from each other, and t shuddering at these blood-stained portals." e "rI heard a moan!" said Margaret.   c "From   some miserable wretch, suffering for his crimes or misfortunes."     1 Thevy heard a sneer from their guide, who turned his masked face over his shoulder, as if to mock at their fears. "Is it much farther?"Margaret, asked timidly. - ,              t "This," he replied, unlocking an iron door, n "enda your walk for the present."    p His voice Wans cold and ungracious.  J "It looks like a dungeon,'T said Ruby. e "It communicates with the Thames. En- d ter first, for thfs passage must be closed as we c found it."                w "You are sure that you understood her k Ladyship?" queried Ruby, apprehensively. b "Entirely l" replied the mask, who had   stepped back, and kept thrusting into the darkness impatiently with- the torch. "Hold up jour link; I will satisfy my doubts before I enter!" said Margaret, firmly. And relinquishing her cousin's arm, she ran forward and looked through the open door. Their guide pushed her over the threshold with an exultant laugh; and partly closed the door; "Fly! fly"' screamed Margaret. "We are deceived I This is Jeffreys!" "Yes," exclaimed their conductor, tearing off his mask, I am Jeffreysl Ha, ha, ha! Who triumphs now?" Rubly waited to hear no more, but turning, fled into the darkness with a swiftness inspir- ed by terror. Jeffreys closed the door of the dungeon, hurriedly locked it, and pursued the fair fugitive, who ran blindly and perilously, groping her way through slimy avenues lead- ing she knew not where. Occasionally she saw the gleam of the torch, and heard the voice of Jeffreys, which incited her to addi- tional exertions. Physical inability presently obliged he, to stop. She leaned against a wall for support, and finding a door ajar, opened it, and passed through, drawing it to- gether after her. When she had rested a moment, she groped about with her hands, and soon convinced herself that she was in a dungeon. She step- ped on a chain,'that rattled with a dreary sound beneath her feet, and upset a stone pitcher which must at some time have con- tained water for an unfortunate inmate. Overcome with fatigue and emotion, she sank down upon a heap of decaying straw. Just then a fluctuating ray of light fell across a latticed door. She  cowered closer to the straw, and an instant later saw: Jeffreys go by at a moderate pace, like one who looks care- fully for an object that he suspects may be near. As he went on, the gleams which stole through the iron bars revealed to her the rust-  eaten chain, the stone pitcher, a broken cru- cifix, and a worm-eaten missal.  i The link swept on, and the transient glare left the cell more intensely dark. CHAPTER   XIV. NIGHTSHADE. Ruby Mallows shut her eyes, and covered them with her hands, appalled by the black- ness and silence.- Hearing footfalls in the passage, she raised her head, expecting to see Jeffreys, but saw no'light. The sounds, how- ever, that-had called her notice, were still au- dible, and manifestly drawing nearer; 'they came also from a direction opposite that by which. Jeffreys would naturally return. She knew not whether to regard this as a favora- ble augury, or a new danger. The cautious movement of feet gradually   approaching her concealment were, under the circumstances, startling, and her ajpprehen- sions were greatly and thrillingly Increased when the door of the dungeon was pushed open, and some one entered. Ruby sank closer to the wall and the mouldering straw. She hushed her breath, and pressed her hands tightly to her throbbing heart to muffle its beatings. The intruder stood still. It was a man's step, but his form, though so near, was lost in the inky darkness. It was in vain that she strained her powers of vision and taxed her sight; the thick and almost suffocating gloom was impenetrable. Imagination sug- gested a thousand possibilities. Conjecture ran riot, till it sank reeling and weary in her brain. Should she speak? Should she ad- dress this unseen and unknown presence? Superstition said it might be the unhappy shade of the former occupant of the dungeon, on whose limbs the chain had rusted; who had drank from that pitcher; who had knelt before that broken crucifix ; who had read, br fitful torchght, from that mouldering mis- sal. There were awe and sadness in a flash of thought like this. She heard his respiration; it was the healthy breathing of a strong man. Could she hear the regular strokes of his heart,? She fancied so, but it might have been the red, fluttering little prisoner in her own breast. There was a dull thud of steps. A long, quivering lance of light darted across the lat- 'tice-work. Ruby beheld the pale and trem- *bling harbinger with varied feelings. She felt that some kind of a denouement was at hand. Jeffreys was. returning. He came on with frequent haltings and mutterings. He was like the hound off the scent and at fault. His terrible passions, so frequently wrought into fury by the slightest causes, by wordy con- flicts with thieves and criminals, and by his own cruel impatience, were-, now excited to frenzy. He yelled and blasphemed, as lihe sometimes did at the Old Bailey. He smote the stones with his feet. Ruby thought of a caged beast shaking its chain, and biting the links with wrathfdl howlings. The link flamed more vividly, and threw glancing gleams on a dark and motionless form in the dungeon, which suddenly began to separate from the pervading blackness. Ruby saw a hand steal through the lattice of the door,and grasp a bar. -- The next moment the door was thrown open with such force, that it rolled against the wall with a dull crash, that was echoed through the damp aisles of the vault. "Stand!" 'cried an imperative voie. "Stand, on your peril!" Jeffreys retreated to the wall in amazement, holding his link before him likl an arquebuss, t. keep off-the unexpected challenger,   , What means this? Who bids me stand?" he demanded. "I bid you stand!" said the man who bad bounded from the dungeon.      - His voice rolled along the subterranean cor- ridors, deep and sonorous. "I bid you stand. Look at me 1" Sir George Jeffreys did look at him, and so did the watchmaker's daughter. The latter had no difficulty in remembering that she had seen him at Hounslow Heath, and still. later, as she believed, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, acting as her champion. This recognition was most welcome. But her mind immediately went into a flurry of perplexity respecting the manner by which he had gained ingress-to the Tower. He still wore the suit of green velvet, and presented the same dark, stern face. Jeffreys glared fiercely at the bold man. "What do you want?" he cried. Nightshade slowly unsheathed his rapier, keeping his eyes firmly on Jeffreys. "There is a paper, Sir George, in the lining of your doublet that I must have," he said, with entire coolness. "It's a lie! a lie!" retorted Jeffreys. "A pap 'r," resumed Nightshade, which I must hxve at the price of blood, or even life. Sir George Jeffreys, I am not one to take de- nial. That paper in your doublet, if deliver- ed to the king, would cause the shedding of blood, one drop of which is worth more than all that flows in your base body." "You are. deceived! You are misinform- ed!" protested Jeffreys, with the torch still thrust forward like a spear. (' Will you surrender it peaceably, or shall 1 rip it from your doublet with this weapon, when I have passed it through your body, as I am presently going to do." "Never! I never!" howledJeffreys, sudden- ly extinguishing his torch, and attempting to run. But Nightshade was too much on the alert to be baffled. He caught him by the throat, and they struggled some moments. During the briet contest, Jeffreys drew the, paper from his doublet and cast it from him, resolv- ed to preserve it at any hazard. As fortune would have it, it fell in the dungeon upon Ruby's person, whence it. slid to the floor. Instinctively she picked it up, and placed it in her bosom..            - Meantime, Nightshade bore down JAffreys Iwith his great strength, and planting his knees 3on his chest, put the point of his rapier at his throat. "The paper! the paper!" he eaid, sternly, "or this moment ends your infamous life." "Willingly will I yield-every paper on my , person; but I swear to ye that I have not that which you seek. ,Before cutting my throat,   I tplorc you to: search my person. 'If  move, let it be the signal of my death." "Clasp your hands over your lied,; and move them so much as the hundredth part of an inch, and I will -stab you, to the heart! -I know you to be an execrable liar; ; but this' lie, if lie it be, shall be the dearest you eer told. Your life, groveling wretch, is o'f less account, when weighed withthis matter,than the'slime beneath you,'"answered NightShade, i searching Jeffreys' doublet and other gat'- mernts wlthout success. "Arise 1" he said, commandingly. ' There is one'condition on' Which you shall escape. Strip'yourself immediately r' Jeffreby began to demur. "Don't trifle, dog!" thunderedNightshade. "YFor one act of treachery, your life s already forfeit to me. Qff with eoat, doiblet, trunk- hose, stockings, and shoes. Haste, villain- haste!" Ruby heard Sir George disrobing, casting his garments from him with suppressed curses. Whenh this reluctant task was 'concluded, Nightshade grasped him by the wrist. '"My safety requires that you-haillnot leave the vaults at present. There is a dungeon her -in which I willseoure you." ruby, ihearing this; made a hurried and noiseless exit from the cell. "4 This   -is tre than you demanded," mattered. Jeffreys, .gnashing his teeth with rage. "Thank God that I 'have ndt slain you,S' retorted Nightshade, forcing him into the dun- geon, and clanging the door, took a bunch of keys from his side, andlat the third trial fitted one to the lock., "There!" he!said, when he had turned "the lodk. '"-Solace yourself with- that comfort which you delight to give to others. I wish, some of the forced visitors to the Old Bailey could have the privilege of holding a'torcEi to this latticed door, and looking on your na- lIedhbes nnd helpless ' Wrath. You man of thceks, and whippings, and  cart-tails, and. hrming's!  Sauce -for the goose is sauce for the gander." t"M'ook  on, thou gallows-bird I I hope to God'you will come before me some time, -when3I will give you such a sentence thatnot P two joints of: lye siall hang: together." 'rhe ;hero ;of iHdusoulW lauighed aloud. "Faith, 'Sir George I I doubt if I ever stand before your tribunal," -he" answered. Then, more serous: "If yuwshould dhahea to 1rot 'whveb you ate, ttel thea De;ill thit Nightshade sent ye." A souind between a ishriek ind a sowl bame from the dungeon, "Gnaw   Ithe ibbrse wwith your 'teeth, Sir George!"- addedNightshade.  Thelatter took  asmall box from his pocket containing flint,-    steel, and tinder, struck fire and lighted the extinguished torch. "It's 'always best," he said, quietly, " to-be provided againstthese'little accidents. '"Then  gathering up Jeffre's garments, and wishing him a comfortable night's rest, he moved along the passage with them on his arm. Ruby, who had been watching for hit com- ing, suddenly placed herself before him. -"Oopd, Sir," Bhe cried, "I crave your pro- tection!"  'By my sleginnce, pretty one, you Shall have it!" he replied. "Let me see your face. The watchmaker's daughter, as I live! You will bear witness that I did my best to serve you t  nhis night: if, perchnnce, you knew we through the White and Black." "Yoi were kind and brave. Your Iask did ibot deceive me. My companion and my- self were betrayed and brought hither." "' By whsom?"

"You are not, you cannot be what you seem."      \ *"It is but too well known what I am. I am Nightshade; the terror of children and the gossip of fools." ' You cannot be a base-born robber!" cried Ruby. :"Something in your face and deport- ment gives the lie to the thought." *"Nay, young woman, you but flatter me:! Yet, in truth, thy-good opinion is pleasant," responded Nightshade,-courteously. "But let us move on," he added; " for, to be frank. with you, many noble heads are in great per- "You wanted a certain paper?" queried Ruby.

'Keep the trifle as a slight memento of the royal clemency; for I am sure that it will give you more con- tent and happiness where it is, than it would me after being clipped by-the headsman." "Gracious liege, your gift is invaluable. I will keep it as long as I live. God save your majestyz"  With a profound. obeisance, Nightshade turned and strode swiftly away. The king gazed after his noble figure till it was lost in the gloom. "A most princely fellow!" he muttered. "I would give a diamond from my crown to know his history. Five hundred guineas on his head, and yet he walks the streets of Lon- donl"Then to Hungerford, who had iot heard an intelligible word of this conversa- tion: "Young man, why have you assailed my friend? Are the ,sports of gentlemen to be spoiled by every clown one chances to meet?" "By no means, sir; by such clowns only as I. When gentlemen forget what is due to themselves and others, it is fitting that their inferiors should teach them manners," an- swered Dyce, folding his arms, and frowning moodily. ," You take a high tone, young sir!" re- sumed the king. "I would advise you to be more chary, in future, of both your stick and your tongue." "Advice which, with your leave, I reject. My stick and my tongue will always be ready in a good cause. I hold it the duty of every one to defend woman, sister, mother, sweet- heart, or wife ; and with the help of Heaven I will not fail to do so on every occasion that offers, be the aggressor gentle or simple." Dyce Hungerford looked defiantly at the king. Anger was burning like fire in his heart. He wished to wreak his wrath on some one for what had happened. "I pardon this language," replied the king, quietly, " because there is manifestly a sweet- heart in this case. Let me tell you, candidly, that you had better run after that carriage ; for the maidens have jumped from the frying- pan into the fire." "By the saints! I believe you have hit upon the truth., We shall meet again, my masters, and sooner or later, this matter shall be settled." Dyce Hungerford darted away like a mad- man, and ran as fast as he could, but before he reached Holburn, the vehicle had turned   L AD.; VA, ' down Chancery Lane; by the time he reached Chancery Lane,. it was flying along Fleet street, and he could not even hear the rum- bling of the wheels. He ran from street to street, in desperate endeavor to get sight ofthe coachl, but wearied and worried himself for nothing. He retraced his way to Red Lion street in a miserable state of mind. He knew not-what tale to tell the watchmaker. He paused opposite the Three Dials, under the Sign of the Woman's Head, to take breath and counsel with himself. While he stood panting, he heard a singu- lar thudding on the stairs, alternately light and loud. A hand touched his wrist; a hand clammy and ,corpse-like in its feel. Hungerford looked behind him, and saw the weasand face and awry body of Ajax Bransom. His first impulse was to shake him off and run across the street; for the presence of this unwholesome thing gave him a cold thrill of the nerves, and an'involuntary shock. "Young man," croaked Ajax, " what has happened? You seem hot and distressed." "It don't concern you!" muttered Hun-  gerford, absently. "You trouble me. Go away!" "'Pardon me," answered Ajax, "for med- dling or making with what does not immedi- ately concern me. But, who knows what good may come of frankness? If this is a love- affair, as I suspect, Heaven has sent you here." Bransom lifted his short leg and dumped it down two or three times, as if he would make so many exclamation-points. "What has Heaven to do with you? Is this a celestial agency? Are you a sort of St. Peter in Love?" demanded Dyce, sarcas- tically. "1 That is good!" retorted Bransom, chuck- ling, rubbing his hands. "St. Peter is good. St. Peter holding the key of the flowery courts of Love. Yes, I am Love's St. Peter. I lock and I unlock, I bind and I loose. Ho-ho I -He- he " The two clammy -hands went together, and the short leg made/another exclamation-point on the floor. His small eyes danced in his head like two faded fire-flies. "Come up, young man, come up I My key shall unlock your difficulties. I am as skillful with the heart as with the brush." With an incredulous sneer on hi lips, Hun- gerford followed Ajax to his hot-bed of art. Drowning men. catch at straws.: In truth, Dyce cared little where he went. The abduc- tion of Ruby had exercised a stunning influ- ence upon lim, and he needed time to recover. A dim light was burning in the studio., Hungerford drew back in alarm when he be- held the phantom faces simpering at him from every side. He rubbed his brow, and queried if he was not the victim of an ugly dream.   "Stop a moment," said Bransom, "till I light up. You lose half the effect in this dull shimmer." "Spare yourself the trouble," replied Hun- gerford. "A glare on these would be horri- ble. I beg your pardon! I mean that a mild light suits best my mood to-night." "Ah, I see! Your disturbed state requires, soft illuminations, dLreamy outlines, and sub- dued shade. So be it. Be seated. This -is my flower-garden.  Look around you, and in these living creations of the brush, forget your dead hopes." "How know you that I have dead hopes?" asked Dyce. 1"Your St. Peter knows almost everything. Name something that I don't know. I know you." "Me?" "The watchmaker's apprentice; Hunger- ford by name; in love with a jewel called Ruby. f That is your secret." "Trhat is possibly a part of it," replied Dyce, coldly. "True; a part of it. There is more. She is pursued by a court-gallant-one, I'll be sworn, that has power enough to carry his point." "It is false!" cried Hungerford. "No one has that power while I live!"He stamped on the floor:furiously. "Moderate your transports," quoth Ajax, wriggling on his seat. "Hear what I'm go- ing to say. The watchmaker's daughter is already beyond your reach. I read that in your downcast spirit." "She has been treacherously and wicked- ly carried off," said Hungerford, huskily. "Lost to you-that is, without the help of St. Peter. I've got a clue, young gentleman -a clue, sir!" "A clue! You a clue?" repeated Hunger- ford, with surprise. "By what singular. means can you have any knowledge of this transaction?"I "Men must not be judged by what they seem ; especially," added the painter, " men of genius. Knowledge is not necessarily lim- ited to one pursuit, however skilled one may be in it." "Most trpe!" said Dyce, thinking it best to gratify the vanity of Ajax. "But I pray you not to keep me in .suspense. If you can give me information that shall lead to the discovery of the two young women who have been abducted, your reward shall be com- mensurate to. the importance of the service" "For a watchmaker's 'prentice, that was well said'!" replied the painter, dangling his short leg, while the pale light lay spectrally on his cunning face. "Mind you, 'prentice, I have not said that I positively know any- thing of this business;' but I'm a man always A,  .,  R      ,   ready to oblige an honest fellow. My suspi- cions point in a certain direction; not to a dead certainty, mind you, yet what I call a pretty strong circumstantial case. Well, the upshot of it is, that my doubts can be dissi- pated or confirmed. Digest this fact; you are unequally pitted against power. If St. Peter aids you with his key, understand that it will be a dangerous office." The faded, fire-fly eyes winked very fast, and leered from under their brows at Hun- gerford. Hle reminded the young man of a domesticated crow that had been at, or was contemplating mischief. He rather expected- to hear him " caw! caw!" "If paltry gold has any value in the eyes of an artist-wo signally gifted, I belieye I may safely promise you an adequate recompense. Though not rich, I have friends who will aid me Sin doing you justice. The greater the peril, the greater your deservings." "In sheer compassion for your youth," re- plied Ajax, sympathetically, "-for I've had my love-passages myself, 'll warrant ye-I accede to your wishes. I know what the soft passion is. I could name some names, if I had a mind. I've been a devil of a fellow, I'm afraid!" Hungerford involuntarily glanced at the shapes around him, and observed: "It is, easy to see that you have taste, sir." Bransom irritated the dead thorn-wreath around the base of his head to make it bris- tle more knowingly, and was about to reply, when Craw Kibbie came in. This young per- son was somewhat confused at seeing Hunger- ford, but her natural confidence could not be long dashed. Before she had time to speak, the painter hastened to the rescue. "Go away, girl-go away! Do0 you think I set up anights to paint pictures for the maids of gentlewomen? Come at proper hours, mistress." - -  !"Spare your reproaches, excellent sir," replied Kibbie. "I have come, not to be painted, but to borrow twenty guineas, which, unfortunately, I have need of im- mediately." - The painter, who had been sitting, lighted * on his feet at a bound, and stared at the girl as if she had done him a serious injnry. "My poor, dear mistress," added Craw, beginning to snivel, " has been carried away by some naughty, naughty men, and my heart is nearly broke with grief." "What's that to me?" snarled Ajax. "This is a wicked king's reign," continued Craw, growing more moist. "They not only rob our purses, but our virtues." "Go home with your virtues!" advised the painter, curtly.  "Not till rhave the twenty guineas," af- firmed, Kibbie. "Not till I have the twenty   gain eas t seek the pretty dear all 'over the tworld.

"What are youe?  demanded the young man, relinquishing his hold. "An animal poison," replied Kibbie, .With la little jerk of the 'shoulders.

"PerShaps-who knows?-I mayisome- 'tixe Speak it to you. If you would hear to reason, y bu would give up the pursuit of the watchmaker's daughter." "Never I never!" cried Dyce. "!I will not rest till I discover the wretches who have committed this outrage, and punish them." "It. is bravely threatened, but the accom- :plishmnent will 'be less easy. Possibly," she added, laughing, "Spiderlegs will help you. :He's an Ajax in more than one seinse. See 'what he has done. Look around this art- rookery. Behold these fragments of beauty'!

Craw Kibbie whirled on her heel, tipped over a frail head, and pirouetted from the studio. "She's a -devil! a devil!" muttered Ajax. Then putting on a hat and cloak, and buckling short sword to his waist, he said to Hunger- ford: i' Come with me!" CHAPTER XVI. -. THE CRUSHED   HAT. Passing through West Smithfield to New- gate, Ajax led the way along Cheapside, down King William, to Lower Thames street. It waes now late in the evening and quite dark. A dusky gloom and silence rested on the long lines of low houses, pervading the lanes; courts, and squares. The Thames rolled on with a deep and sullen murmur. Hungerford paused when they reached Great Tower Hill. Thus far he had followed, un- qiuestioning, the limping footsteps of Bran- soro. He thought it prudent to go no farther blinaly. "I tire of this vagueness," he said. "What one knows, it seems ;to tme, he tnay speak bolly." "In love, my brave 'prentice, there is al- Ways mystery, Take away the mystery, and love wouldn't be-worth seeking.. A man may safely'lep sonietliing to himself," answered Ajax. "I concede all you say, worthy!painter, coscerning love and mystery; but .that con- Cerns'not myvpresent-purpose. I wish to act, in -a rational malnner. You are as chary of your 'secret as a-miser of his gold. Got Moneypenny himself could not cling closer   to his :money-bags :than you to your vaunted key," added Hungerford. ".If you have so little interest in the re- covery of your sweetheart," replied Ajax, with a sneer, "-in eaven's name let us go back." ,  "I did not propose .to return, but to know whither you' are taking me, and what relation thig nocturnal walk has to Ruby Mallows and Margaret Gurther. You shall find me bold enough as soon as a thread .is iput into my hands that I can follow."  The apprentice' endeavored 'to, scrutinize the countenance of the artist, and read, if possible, his sincerity ;or ,falsehood in it, but saw only the phantom shadows df night flit- ting fitfully across it. "When I was a young man," said Bransom, "I. allowed nothing to stand in the way of a liaison. I snapped my fingers at danger." "This is not a liaisou," responded Hunger- ford, coldly. "If I had time and disposition" resumed Ajax,. with a conceited oscillation of -his head, "I1 could tell you a famous tale ,of an elope- ment; of an irate father, horses ,at full speed, mad pursuit, and the fair one in interesting ddshabille, just as she escaped from:her bed- ehamber. Courage, 'prentice I Our days of intrigue, thanks to Cupid, are not yet passed. I know what women are, lad. I can trikl the sweet creatures to my liking by praising a turn of the head or a casteof the eye. Says I: 'Madam, I can't paint you without In- spiration. There are those, madam, that I can't paint at all. Ah, madam, you will in- spire me'! An exquisite :brow! Adelicious throat  An incomparable bust I' m awwom- antman. I may noth,be iequal to your style ; but if I fail, there's not an .artistin London that can succeed." Ajax performed his raven laugh on   the rickety gamut of his voice, and made ;three exelamation-points with ;his abridged leg. $With 'that polished pate, that wreath of 1 grey hairs, and that decrepit person, methinks I you have somewhat passed the age of gallan-  try," replied Hungerford, uhnble to repress I his contempt for the sickly egotism and oraf- t tminess of the painter.  -    '  A  fierce and venomous expression swept d over Bransom's face. :is self-love was deep- A ly wounded.  Mean souls never'forgive astab at their vanity.     ,     , "The young are: apt to Itaunt those :a trifle f in advance of them  on the road of life," he I muttered.               . "Imeant no offence. Have your intrigues and deceive Mrs. Ajax as often as you will;-  but, in the name  of St. Peter, ,let us: to the business in hand." .:  Bransom hobbled onmoodily. :Hestopped  anon. 'Hungerford beheld before him  the i   Tower of London. They were opposite that gray pile called the Lion's Tower. First, there was a street; then a row of houses, and a high wall against which they abutted,; then the moat,.black and deep; then various courts and buildings, ;constituting that ancient and storied agglomeration known for centuries as the ToWer of London-a fortress, a prison, and a palace., The young man gazed at!the grim walls with feelings of awe not unmingled with in- dignation. He could not but remember the many deeds of cruelty perpetrated in, that ancient stronghold by a long line of kings  and conquerors. "Come,?' said Ajax, "we must enter'here." :"Why   here;?" 'asked MHungerford, who, withdrawing his iattention from the more im- posing .turrets of the Tower, found :himself standing before,a;small wooden fabric, with a sunken and overlapping roof. "If you would find the watchmaker's -daughter," -replied Biansom, "you must sub- mit to my guidance without question. , There is the wall of the Tower; this is Petty Wales. This queer house before us bears the name -of the Crushed Hat. It is an humble mug-house, kept by 'some honest people." "The Crushed Hat!" repeated the, appren- tice.  "A fitting appellation. ( Go on- I am with you. Keep faith with me, Deceiverme, and my vengeance shall be so instant, that it will be little short, of a miracle if you ever return to the Womans Head!" "Threatened -en   live long!" growled Ajax, opening a door and entering the Crush- ed Hat. On looking about, Hungerford per- ceived that he was in a. long, narrow apart- ment, teeming with the blended seents of to- bacco and ale. At one side of -this room was a. square opening, with a sort of cage behind it, in which stood a pretty bar-maid, ready to pass from arow. ofshelves in :the rear what- ever customers might choose to order in her line.' Restiqg'he'r. elbows on the shelf before her, with :he dimpled shin in 'her plump palms, she leveled two black eyes at Hunger- ford. While the latter was taking note -of the surroundings, the rattle of a sword caused him to observe,issuing froma corner, a gayly- dressed youth, who immediately addressed Ajax in a  banteroirag tone. "By St. Wilfred t" {he exclaimed. -Here comes the limnaer of Red Lion street. .How fare you, noble  Ajax? I ,trust all the fair frequenters of the Woman's Head are in good health."        . "Avaunt, you  man-woman   !" returned Bransom,   Annoyed., "Sataiiwill not down at your  bidding!" retorted the comelyyouth. "A'house divid- "   against itself cannot stand. What new mischief is afoot?"   "This facetious person," said Ajax to the apprentice, " is Mary Glasspool; most com- sa monly called Moll Pool; and, not unfrequent- a Iy, the Roaring Girl."          W Hearing this announcement, Hungerford m regarded the nondescript youth with more a iqterest    .            th "Oh, he has heard of me, I'll warrant!" a laughed Moll.              N V "Im obliged' to confess that your name is but too familiar to my ears," replied the. ap- 1B prentice. "Don't be over nice, young man. If I don't complain, you need not. Let the deli- ca cacy go for what it'll fetch. There is but a c poor market for modesty in London," she re- e plied, promptly. Then, to the painter: "-We. V maids are obliged to change our sex to escape o the blandishments of Ajax Bransom. The a fellow hath such an artful tongue, that, i'faith, he'll have the fairest of us for models, if we e don't have a -care!"  Moll Pool laughed a merry, ringing peal, e while the artist frowned and winced under a her humor.    I            I Just then the door of the Crushed Hat gave t ingress to the jolly vagrant of St. Giles. The I great clock of the Tower struck the hour of 9 midnight.                t "Peace to all as loves peace!" said Bill- son, striding toward the bar-maid's window. I'm werry dry, my princess. Give us a mug, deary ; not your own sweet mug, but a ugly mug, with the foam atop. That's it, honey. Wot a nice 'un she is I The lilies o' the walley a'n't equal to lher. A health to all in the sound o'my woice! Billson drained his mug at a single gasp; and, scraping the foam from his beard with his hand, declared it the best drink in England. "* Who is this?". asked Hungerford, in a low voice. The ears of the vagrant caught the interro- gation. "It's a good question, and a proper," he hastened to reply, " and one as I'll try to an- swer without wanity: My father was a wa- grunt, and my mother was a wagrunt, and I am a wagrunt. My forefathers was dooks, who had their 'eads cotched in baskets for treason. It was a wallable thing for our fami- ly when the royal blood run out,. and the wagruney run in. This, sir, is my ewentful history. Look at it Il Turn it over! Con- template it from warious p'ints! Consider it, moreover!" Mr. Billson did not forget to blow up his cheeks, and eclipse his red nose by two purple puffs of flesh. at Stop your patter!" said Moll. "Learn, to answer the gentleman without giving the history of the family, every one of whom, I'll be bound, died at Tyburn." .   "JJU i VXs "Gentleman!" echoed Lack, with bland sarcasm.!"Where is your gentleman, tiat's a gentleman more than another gentleman? We're all gentlemen together- the watch- maker's 'prentice, the warmint of the brush, and the Roarin' Girl, into the bargain. Yet the best gentleman of all is a wagrunt. Wot's a king? Wot's a lord? Wot's a dook? Wictims I Wictims and wanity!" "Have you ever heard of the White and Black?" asked Moll Pool, eying him sharply. The vagrant for a moment was nonplussed. "I've heard the tales of old women. In course. Without doubt. Wotis it? A brave covey, as wears a mask of two colors. Wot else v He's .here, and there, and everywhere. Whose business is it? Nobody's, as Iknows on,. but his'n. This adwice hear: Let him alone." "How would you like five hundred. guin- eas?" added Glasspool. "St. Stephen save me from 'em!" exclaim- ed Lack. "' I wants no guineas at that price, and I say woe to him as wants guineas at that price. A man as is in two places at the same time, isn't, safe to meddle with. I've knowed him, of my own knowledge, to rob a lady at F Tunbridge Wells, and a lord at Lunnon, at the same hour and minute, by the best watches ever made at Clerkenwell." "I believe not in this," said Hungerford. "I It is arrant folly. Sir painter, if you intend % to do me the service you promised, let usB ; make no further delay. Why we are here, or ; what this has to do with the matter, I am at D a loss to conceive. If you are trifling with me, let me assure you that I am not the'right * person to bear it patiently." h  Hungerford spoke in whispers. Bransomr 1. immediately checked him: W  "Be quiet!" he muttered. "We must not excite the suspicions of these people. Moll - and the vagrant must be deceived respecting our object in coming hither." e  "Excellent Ajax," quoth Moll, " hast thou e- not an odd shilling to spend in sack? Me- D thinks yonder comely bar-maid would like to I finger money of thine." 8  " Buy thine own sack, thou he, she, it! If Dn I were athirst, I should pay for what would ki- satisfy it." ie  "Go to, for a churlish fellow! I spoke not ul for myself, but for this walking gentlemen, n- who sleeps in kennels, and snatches his food er as a dog a bone. Thou art but a lecherous limner, fit only for the meaner part of thy lis trade. As for skillfulness in thy professed )le art, God help those that can do no better!" , Foul-spoken harlot!" mumbled Ajax. n,  "Rail on, viper I The time will come when he your deeds will be manifest.. There are eyes ['ll on you, Ajax,.that can see as far as yours. Remember that, in all your dark plottings   and windings. Spiders have been eaught in their own webs, and struggled in vain to break the meshes of their trap." Glasspool jangled her sword, and retreating to a corner, threw herself carelessly upon a settle. The apprentice heard her words with curiosity and doubt.  He distrusted more than ever the good faith of the painter. The latter, perceiving that she had made an im- pression, hastened to weaken her influence. t, An unfortun ate creature," he whispered to Hungerford, " whose intellect is disordered. It is seldom that she appears in the proper garb of her sex. Mind her not. Come this way. Good-night, jolly vagrant. May the road afford you a thousand pleasures. Soft be the board, dry the gutter, and wholesome the kennel, whereon and wherein you may rest while on the tramp." "Peiadwenture!"   said Mr. Billson, and lighted his pipe. Crossing the tap-room, Ajax opened a door at the extreme end. Hungerford looked over his shoulder, as he followed, and saw Moll Pool make a warning gesture. He was too much in earnest to be diverted from his pur- pose by an intimation so vague, but resolved to be on his guard. "Come in," said Ajax, " and have faith in my key. You shall find me such a St. Peter to-night as you never saw before." "Having begun the adventure, I will not -recede," said Hungerford. "It would be foolish to do so," replied Bransom, securing the door. They were in a smaller'room  than that they bad left. A brawny woman, in a high cap and a short kir- tle, sat mumbling over a black-letter book, by a rush-light. She was a masculine creature, with a beard like a man. She did not notice Ajax and the apprentice, but kept at her mut- tering, following the heavy black characters with her finger. CHAPTER XVII WHAT BEFELL HUNGERFORD IN THE TOWEL "This is Dame Wimple," said Ajax. "She's a devotional soul, whose thoughts are but little in this world.  The pretty bar-maid is her  grandaughter."         , Glancing at her harsh, coarse face, Hunger- ford mentally protested that hecould see no : family resemblance between grandam   and 1 grandaughter. He shrank with secret re- pugnance from this mumming   dame. He 1 wondered what she could have to do with her he sought, providing she were indeed the ob- e ject of Ajax's visit. "Pious dame," said the painter, " heed us i not. Our business is beyond."      i "Begone!" exclaimed the woman, in a voice t strangely unfeminine.  "Trespass not upon i my time and place. Ye are welcome to the A   right of passage, if ye but go quickly. Death is near, time is short, and the journey before me long. I would be ready when the bride- groom cometh. Go, ye worldlings, go!" Bransom took a link from- the wall, and lighted it. "Still farther?" queried the apprentice. "What is past is 80 commonplace, that our- journey may be said to be but now begun."* "Tie Crushed Hat has, a wondrous depth," observed Hungerford.. "Yes," peplied Ajax, with a significant shrug, " and you'll find it still deeper." With another inquisitive look at Dame Wimple, the apprentice left the circumscribed limits of her retreat, and was ushered by his limping guide into a compartment yet small- er, lighted neither by grate nor window. It seemed to the young man that they must be beneath the wall of the Tower, or rather in the centre of it. "You must be hoodwinked," said Bran- som, taking from the wall a long fold of cloth, which had evidently been used for such a pur- pose before. ;"I have yielded to you, thus far, implicit- ly; but 1 will not be blinded. Keep your bandage for other eyes," replied Hungerford, with resolution. "Nay, but hoodwinked you must be, or here the adventure ends," persisted the painter. "Let it end, then; for I will not yield to this singular demand."  "Fool!" croaked Ajax, stamping furious- ly. "How can I serve you if you are obsti- nate?" "You shall not serve me this trick, at least; for if 1 understand the law of Nature, eyes were made to see with." In looking about the small, black cell-it could scarcely be called a room-Hungerford discovered a rapier, with a basket hilt, lying on the floor. Thisweap- on he immediately secured.  His guide be- held the movement with alarm. "Leave it I leave it!" he said. "This is a peaceful enterprise, and a sword will be but an encumbrance." "A  sword, worthy artist, will do no harm if there be no occasion for its use, and much good, in the event of the reverse. You will find me as perverse about this steel as in the matter of hoodwinking. So go on, most mys- terious painter." Ajax scowled and grimaced venomously; but, after a moment of reflection, answered: "Have, then, your way, young man. What- ever comes of your headstrong will, blame yourself for it. Our way lies downward." He stepped on a spring with his crippled foot, and a slding-door shot backward like a shut- tie, leaving a square opening in the floor, re- vealing  to Hungerford a  flight of steps. Adown these steps went Ajax, swaying his   tortoe, jetkingphis libeiE and muttering to hiiself. On' hobbled the imp ofthee brtusb. o1 They were in a plae so damp that. beads of fo sweat stood onthe walls. They entered, what a appeared to:the apprentice a long conduit of m masonry. There was a reek of braofeish wa- ter fpobm xvarious:areviees. The thought struck 'r Mhin that they werea passing through the, oat He by a subterranean passage., He didnot speak d s suspieioni htw,evei, to his ondaduetor. I Presently they reached, a widei and' drier D roih, along which Branihorn hurried as fest as -fr his infirmities would permit;. Occasionally r thleit disturbed olonies of rats, whieh ran a ,aquePaingS and bickering into holes and oran- c nsees, ob sweptr ora:before them like the scat- itered lhostsofn army. -  Hurigerford watehed His guidoe withi unceas- ai inv vigllaneo, tesolved, on the flrst proof of Areackry, oinmak him pay a fearfal price for a it. When this sub-mundane journey had t l tetida longi time,. Brnsom arried at an iron f TOO set ln massive stonmasory,d takingm : nome rusty kovs from -his: pelsonl, suaceeded e in opening this barrier. He hitched through, 1 d. thie apprentiee followerd, hen the iron V door was closed. Theyoung man had endeavored to ma rk  the distance which they traversed, and fix the dideetion- ih his mind. If he hwl not erred in his calculations, he believed; thatf he now stood beneath the Lion's Tower. "Thou goest on rarely," he rtmarked. sfSholl wei not soon get at the ke=nel of'thy I touwledge, mighty .&jax^ t' - Spare your sarcasm, 'prentice. Conde- serid not to':one whose noble art raises him far above watch-springs and escapements," daswered Bransomr, curtly. '"I eiave your pardon I T should bave re-. membered that you are powerful not only in paintr but in pander." , '&What did you say " asket the lame liam- ner, turning suddenly' npon Hungerfoid. -"Only that I should have borne in mindl that you are potent both in. paint and love.. Where are we, good sip" "N  f matter:; whlere yoniaever were before, 1T'1 be sworn; Look around t Saw you ever uch walls .? Beheld ybOt ever such strength?" He looked at Hungeiford with the expeeta- tion of seeing him profoundly astonished; but a quiet sneer flitted over the young man's "All theseo arehes, and vaulted "passages, and /c olumns of stone, asr doubtless very grand, btrong, and durable; but the daugh- ter of Primnna Mallows, at thie present mo- menhf iterests ine iteSnltely mSre.

Nota uiniea willyou get from me till I stand in safety under the sign of the Three Dials. But lest you shiuld think me ungrate- -fl, I wilt sey, that if this nocturnal, subter- raneat adtventure gives me a real clue to tthe abducted maidens, your recompense shall ex- ceed-your expectations." With a snarl and a stifled execration, the artist turned into one of the underground aisles, and shambled on. A man issued from a passage at the right, Oand stopped before Bransom. He bore a torch that burned with a pale white and blue flame. Hiseform was tall and meagre-; his ap- :parel, sombre black, fitting closely to his perp son; his hais, long, stright, and of ebon hue. His brow'was broad, his chin sharp, and his whole faee singalarly pale. Ajasi pused at the sight of this anexpect- ed apparition with unequivocal signs of di- may. Te intruder flun g aloft his blue-ffam- ed link; and a smile broke over his tLps toa displayed h-is long, white teeth. Br'fasom recoilled and attempted: to speak, but his voice died in his throat with an utin- , 'telligible murmur. ' , y . oun have, eome?" said the dark phan- - tom.  ' You have come without beitg sent for. Ho t ho. l" The man laughed strangely down below, as Bransom had heard him on the oceasion of his unaccountable visit to the Woman's Head. I  "This is friendly! This is reciprocal t I visit mow f you visit me. You love heads,;  love heads. Shake hands, brother."  The man held out a pallid hand. The painter d stepped back, waving him away. y mvaft tavauntr Phe'articulated. "Oome not near meo' "'Be not 6hurlish, friend Aiax.

'4 I am one, brother artist, held in detesta- tion by mankind. Men tremble at the men- teon of my name. I am a walking horror to humanity." Ajax crossed himself and muttered a short prayer. "iThat's right; that's right fellow-artist Men and women are wont to fell to their prayers when they, meet me. You have not been so pious in a long time. -Wait a mo- ment, and I am sure Heaven will answer you. Heo! ho.! ho!"  The man's eyes glittered like steel. 'His? laughter was fierce and mocking. "Leave me, good devil!" faltered the painter. - "Men call me Leechcraft!" added the grim intruder. "The headsman l" gasped Ajaz. "I   did not gr?^tly err in taking you for Satan." '-' You should be the last to fear the arch- enemy of mankind,'" answered Leechcraft. ' You have seeved him long and faithfullvy ahd the devil were but a sorry devil should he give you the go-by- at last. But what is your business? Whom uring you nhere? "4 A watchmakers 'prentice, who comes to visit a prisoer on fined in one of the dun- geVos," said Ajax. -         I "Then I am him .you seek. This way, brother. You'll come in a different fashion one of these days. When I have leisure, I shall be happy to show you my cabinet of heads." Leechcraft strode on in advance of Ajax, while Hungerford, grasping firmly his rapier, followed. They had walked perhaps a hun-  dred yards, through various labyrinthine d windings, when Leecheraft stopped and swung  his torch three times around his head in fiery oircles, Immediately, six arquebussiersad- C vanced upon the apprentice, who, perceiving - thait he was, betrayed, sprang UpOn Aiax and t Seized him by the throat; and it would have. n fared ill with him, had not the guards laid 1 'hands on the apprentice. Seeing that he v could do no more, the, young man threw the  painter from 'him, and he fell heavily upon I the etone floor.             i - Hungerford was not deficient in personal t strength. His muscles were neithier soft nor  effeminate, but seaSoned by exercise. Acting i from the impulse that is born of emergenc, t and enhances all one's physaial powers, ie - shook off his assailantand planting his back I to the wall, menaced the arquebussiers Dwit I his rapie r,  'TeU me," he demanded, " your purpose, and by whose authobrity I am set upon?'i c Our purpose will presently. be manifest, had oui authority is drived: from the king," :1 u*ered it mai tearing na sword, and, who w appeared to have command of the soldiers. / 1   -  Havinng violated no laws, I protest against  this violence," replied the. young man. D  "Your presence in theivaults of the Tower is sufficient to warrant your arrest," returned t he who had before spoken. "Guards," he added, ".-fall back. Level your weapons. ' The soldiers obeyed this order. "r .Ydu are one of the wardens of the Tow- ; erP" queried Hungerford. "I* am.

"Bring. him this way," said the. warden, and, preceded by Leecheraft, plunged into one of the obscurest passages. An iron gate was opened anon, and the watchmaker's appren- tice was pushed into a dark place and looked in.  Ajax, who had gotten upon his unequal legs again, pressed his face between the bars, and cried: "I am St. Peter, 'prentice I What do you think of my key? Ho, ho0 '" '"False knave 1" exclaimed Hungerford. You're in the Tower of London," added Ajax, tauntingly. "The tower of London is a rat-trap. You can get in, but .you can't get out.'          , "You'll have broken   bones if, thel trap should not chance to hold me,'" replied- the apprentice.          *, t ' "HoI hol" chuckled Braneom.- ^It's a trap that holds kings and queens, and it will be a pity if it cannot keep such a paltry ris. oner as a   watchmaker's 'prentice.

Though suffering. intense anxiety, there was no alternative for the watchmaker's 'daughter but to follow. her: mysterious benefactor, in whose promise she placed more reliance than she would have acknowledged.

She saw a tall, gaunt figure, bearing a link, ap- proaching, followed by a lame man. She hastened back to inform Nightshade.. '.If there are but two," he said, coolly, "we will go on."     - Nightshade' moved forward, and in a few moments stood face to face with Leecheraft and Brans6m.' No s6oner did the latter discover him, than he began to pull the headsman by thd sleeve,' and'whisper: "Look you, Leechoraft, look you! If we are but cunning .enough, we can pocket five hundred guineas as easy as you can whip oft a head." "What do you mean?" growled the heads. man, .stopping, and turning his white face upon the painter. " This," added Ajax, "is that mysterious and everywhere-present thief of the high- way. Mark you not the white and black mask? Speak- him fair, and if you 'have a chance, fell him with your broadsword. But stav I What shadow is that flitting at his heels? It is the watchmaker's daughter, by St. Stephen!"' A ghastly smile: curled the lips of Leech- craft. His eyes glittered with a strange and 'startling light.  "Say you so, brother? Come on boldly, and'seewhat will happen." Leechcraft stilked on and confronted Night- shade. His long, thin, colorless face thrilled Ruby with fear., It was some time before she  could turn herregardsfrom him toAjax, whom  she recognized with undisguised surprise. r '"Who haunts the lower regions at this un- 3 seasonable time?" 'demanded Leechcraft. ' .',One' who has the right, the will, and the - powe to come and;go at any hour., Begone, thdubloodbloat1"  .. : *.Not so fast,.good White and Black! Here * is one at my elbow who' has special business with you."  i  Leecheraft laughed and rumbled hoarsely t down: in his stomachi. 'e . " ,What business has such a reptile with y, :me.?" asked Nightshade, laying his hand on his sword. ..'  -  His H palms have an itching for those same k five hundred guineas. that'the Lord Mayor o- i, London has set upon your head." g  Ajax was thunderstruck at this announce- e ment., He-sheltered himself behind the heads- man,:a notable object of terror. ' Off with your head at once, puissant ie robber, or cast the paltry guineas at his feet." n  The headsman went off in another subter- ranean laugh.   "I protest!" stammered Ajax. "I swear by St. Peter that I was but in jest." "Leechcraft," said Nightshade, autliorita- tively, " seize this fellow and cast him into the rat-pit!'  The rat-pit, or well-chamber, was one of the most horrible contrivances among the ter. rible secrets of the Tower. At high-tide the -water of the Thames,. flowing into various drains, dislodged thousands of rats and drove them for shelter to this pit, into which great criminals were sometimes thrown, to perish horribly. At the mention of this pit, Ajax fell on his knees and begged for mercy. He groveled and writhed like a worm on the slimy flags. "Away with him," added Nightshade," and return to me without delay." "To hear is to obey," answered Leechcraft. Clutching Ajax with his right hand, he drag- ged him away as if he had&been a bundle of rags. His wild shrieks came back'some mo- ments after the headsman disappeared with him. - Ruby would have interceded for him, had not her tongue refused utterance. She. leaned against a rusty-lattice, gasping and dis- mayed. Leechcraft's footsteps had -ceased to be heard, before she could articulate a word. t'I know not," she faltered, ,what this man's crimes may be, yet I do entreat you to spare him." t He is a wretch, alike your enemy and mine," replied Nightshade, sternly. "' In in- terceding for him, you speak against your "Who is this ghastly man who obeys you so implicitly?" she timidly asked. "Pray, young woman, that you may never have his service. He is the headsman of the Tower." Ruby shuddered. Leecheraft'came back from his tragic er- rand as calm as if nothing had happened that was not ordinary. "Good fellow," said Nightshade, " conduct me to the Purple Chamber by the most secret way. I would confide this young woman to the care of Mrs. Haselrigge."' "Mrs. Haselrigge," repeated Ruby; "I have heard that name in connection with Mon- mouth's." 'She blushed at her own boldness. The headsman smiled. "iReport, fair maiden, says a thousand things, both of dukes and robbers, that have but little truth in them. My time is precious. Hurry oh, Leechcraft l The headsmao flourished his torch, and took such strides that it'was'difficult for Ruby to keep pace. They were soon out of the lower vaults, threading the intricacies above. A "The Purple Chamber," announced Leech- raft, pointing to, a door.    "Hold your torch here," said Nightshade. He produced paper and pencil, and hurriedly wrote some lines. Folding the paper, he gave it to Leecheraft, saying. "Knock, and when tie door is opened, give, this to the lady who will appear." Then to Ruby: "Your safety is for the present pro- vided for. -Fear nothing. Your friend shall be found. Here we part, to meet again some time, no doubt. Good-night!" With these words and a hasty gesture of adieu, Nightshade hurried away. CHAPTER XIX, MARGARET AND THE DWARF. Margaret Gurther heard the door look, and saw the light disappear. The suddenness of the transaction bewildered her, and it was some moments before she could realize her situation. The consciousness that she was again betrayed, came upon her with overpow- ering force. The presence of Ruby had thus far sustained her; but suddenly deprived of this support, she became the prey of innu- merable terrors", many of which were imagin- ary. The darkness, the depths of her immur- ation, her remoteness from friends, and the ig- norance of those friends of her fate, together with the uncertainty that hung over her, were certainly sufficient causes of dismay and ap- prehension. She pressed her brow against the cold bars of the door, and- her brain swam dizzily. She grasped the rusty lattice with her hands, ands. put forth her feeble strength ; the heavy door responded with scarcely a perceptible tremor and a faint, dull thud of the bolt in the lock Sinking upon her knees, she suffered her tears to flow unchecked, and audibly invoiced the aid of God and the saints.        I Graduallyv she grew more composed; an unnoted heaviness stole upon her senses ; it was not sleep, but stupor-a deadening of the sensibilities-a friendly interposition by which careful Nature preserves the equilibrium of the minld, and prevents it from being shatter- ed by sudden shocks. She knew not how long she remained in that condition; the first thing that reached her semi-consciousness was the voice of Grub, the dwarf, chanting in his varied tones ;. "I come and I go, Above and below, And no one shall know How I come and I go. Yo-ho! yo-ho!"' : To  Margaret, Grub's vocalization was no longer the croak of a raven, but music most welcome. She called :his name:   "Grub I Grub!" The subterranean aisles caught the sound and echoed it, and went rumbling, away with it till it died-in mysterious nmurmurs in unknown distances.   "Call me'devil, dear; 'call me. devil!" re-" plied the' dwarf; iad;d,; sitting, down upon a stone, laughed with all his might. "My name is Grub, Grub, Grubl -Ahundred voices are crying GOrubGOrub; Gub bS!' 1 Ho, ho! JI love to hear it.

"Call me devil-call me: devil!" shouted ,Grub, who seemed filled with the wildest ex- , ultation. Margaret feared she should not be able to arrest his attention. She .thought of an ex- pedient. She pronounced her own name as distinctly as possible;  ; "Margaret Gurther! Margaret, Gurther t" Innumerable invisible, tongues repeated ,her name. Grub was silent a moment. , The name diverted his thoughts to another .channel. A suspicion crossed his shrewd, -yet eccentric brain. .  "Who calls the innkeeper's daughter? Who wants Margaret Gurther?. Who wants' Meg, Meg, Meg " "It is Margaret herself that. speaks," an- swered the young, woman. "Where are you? There are so:many dev- ils talking here that I can't fix your voice any- where." , -.  ,  , "This,way. Turn half-around  and ad- vance," replied Margaret, who could. see him a long distance off by the light ,of hislink.  "!'Now I have you.  I'll find you ia a min- ute. What a nice thing it is to be strolling about-to gome and .to go, above and below, and,nobody know, why itis so!" The dwarf approached the dungeon, Mar- garet's heart beat ligh with liope. The little monster stood at the grated. door, with the  lit of his, torch thrown apross the bars in a ] redglare.: ,   .  ,     :  "Don't you wish you-was a dwarf, mistress, ' with long ar 4si broad shoulders, and a bloat- v ed head f? If you were, you wouldn't be run 1 awav with, and nobody. would shut you up in dungeons.",  "I want most' of all things liberty, and a ( safe return to the Barley Mow," answered Mar- 1 garet   ^          -  "Who brought you here?;' asked Grub. v ; "'effreys; who had instructions froml Lady e Castletaine to conduct my cousin znd myself I ,from. the Tower." . .          t !"Whichhe wouldn't do," said Grub. "He's I a  fine monster, but not a monster to be trust- 1   -.' ed.- Mistress Castlem'aine must have been out a of her wits iwhen she gave .two such lambs 'to e the keeping of a wolf." a   "Wolf, indeed! 'He may return again to e carry out his vile .designs, and my only. hope t is in you. Help me;and in your extremity may Heaven help you!"' . "eaven enhas hepeme' so much," replied O Grub, with a humorous leer' that I feel back- ward about calling for further aid. See what , arms it has given me; what a' body; what' a head!"He laughed harshy. "Think not of your own misfortunes, which ' cannot be remedied, bu, ot mine, which may. You know the secrets 'of these vaults; take me hence, and- the 'blessings 'and'prayers of I Bartenias Gurther will follow you through life." '"Blessings and prayers," answered Grub,' "have never yet followed me, but I don't mind if I have' a turn at *'em. Here is the f key in the door; I turn it; come out, Meg, come out." The dwarf opened the door. Anew fear seized Margaret. Could she confide in the fidelity of this erratic creature? He noticed her hesitation., "I'll lock it again, if you like," he said. "Perhaps you'll be safer with the door be- tween us. Ho! ho!" ' I m  not afraid,"-replied Margaret, doing some violence to truth. "A lie! 'a lie!" snarled*Grub. "All you fair ones are afraid, of me.: And why? Be- cause I am ,three feet high instead of six ; be- cause ; am. not so large a monster as other monsters.  What matters the matteatte of six inches on the length of an arm, orna leg, or in the circumference of a' heaid? Go to! I 'would not change my corpus with the tallest in the land. It is I that am right, and the world that .is wrong., You 'may scoff. and mock; but, I ai ithe law, And yau the depar- ture frotm it.: Come, come!

But nind yon; mnistress, you must do as 1  bid you. Obedience is the Price of your liberty.   .  . . . ; The dwarf ambled ,on' before; Margaret, wnho folldowed hinm, hoping for a happy termination of the night's adventures;' "He traversed the long paesages by which 'A:jn Bransome,had conducted Hungerford to' the Towei.

'  Margaret mechanically received the book, and assumed. the pose indicated byGrub. i' But what am I to do if this Dame Wimple. should return?" When Margaret had waited a suitable tiime for an, answer, she- raised her eyes and per-' ceived that her singular friend, had disappear- ed. She glanced around ftie little cell; awed by the strange stillhess, broken only by the, monotonous ticking ,of: the clock. A single wick,-fliamed, and; sputtered in a black iron basin, diffusing a light, weird and sickly. She wondered where she was. She liad wandered; far'in lthose underground: dens, and lost all coinprehension :of! place ,or direetion i The night had been so crowded with incident, that a braver mind than hers might well have been bewildered., .Allthe tales she had ever heard .; of fthe:Tower, were vividly revivedin memory, and were ill calculated to give that quiet and  steadi4essf to her nerves whiich she neieded.  The absenceof the dwarf was .strangely,    protracted., She watched the'great staring  dial and aw' it. slowly point the, minutes-- such minutes as no other clock ever made. She tried to divert herself with- the black- letter book, but, could make no sense of the heavy sentences.  .  .  ,She heard Grub coming at lasts he was at' the door. No liherl convietions had traveled too, fiast;, instead of thie' dwarf;, she behelds  man with a'large,:red 'face, broad shoulders, and low of stature,atd;whom she at once re- membered to have seen; ofn several occasions: atthe Barley Mow. -,It was Lack Billson, the vagrant. ,   '   , -Margaro t drew her hood more closely about, her faze, -and bent lower over the book.

Bartemas,' said I, ' is a honest sort o' body; I've warmed myself by his fire, and cheered my stomach with his sack. He keeps a inn.

Adwance something, Begin your argyment. Conwert me, Master Bob, conwert me!" "I've changed my mind, good fellow! I've changed my mind!" exclaimed Margaret, with too much earnestness for the safety of her disguise. "Wot's here? Wot rewealments is this?" cried Billson, in alarm. He - snatched the hood from Margaret's head, and instead of the coarse, masculine face of Dame Wimple, discovered the fair features of the innkeeper's daughter. "The Wirgin save us!" said Mr. Billson. "Here's dewelopments as staggers me. Herees Margaret of the Barley Mow, or of deception I am the wictim." "Yes," replied Margaret, rising, "I am the daughlter of Bartemas Gurther." "Why are you here?" he asked. "Are you, too, in search of five hundred guineas? Did you come to spy out the secrets of the White and black? You'd better staid at home, young ooman.- Better be a bar-maid at the Barley Mow- than anything you can be here." "I should be far from this place, if I had my wish," answered Margaret. "You shouldn't play tricks 1" retorted the vagrant. "If you had told me .your name afore I let out my secrets, you would found it to your adwantage. It was werry wicious in you to let me go on a diwulging what ought to been k,pt neath my own weskiit." "' I had no evil purpose, I assure you," pro- tested Margaret. "* Excuses is in wain. I'm sorry for you; but wot is done can't be undone.- My pretty pigeon, you cannot carry your news abroad." "You. will not have' the heart to -detain me "!' said Margaret, her fears much wrought upon.    "Quite the rewerse!" :replied -Lack, coolly, inflating his face, and smothering his fat nose. "If you have wife, sweetheart, sister, or mother," began Margaret, pathetically. '"Not one on 'em, peradwenture! Not one on'emI thanksye! All isgone. Nothing is left .tO your wagrunt but all the world, which is afore him. Sweethearts, and wives, and mothers is wanity." Margaret was commencing a touching ap" peal to his generosity, when Grub re-appeared. "Hillo!" said Lack. "Here comes a htead and a pair of arms. Where's the rest of the warmint, I wonder?" "There's as much of him. here as you'll need!" answered the dwarf. "Come, Mistress Margaret." '.' Not so fast, my grasshopper!" interposed the vagrant. '"This young ooman has busi- ness with your werry humble servant." "I know not what business she can have with a stroller, who has less wit than the foxes that have holes, and the birds of the air that have nests." Grub cast a-scornful glance at Billson. "You are as impudent a head and arms as I ever see. Begone, or I shall do you a wio- lence!" "Be careful what you do!" shrieked Grub. "Make me your enemy, and you'll be sorry to the last day of your life. You may puff your cheeks, smother your nose, and rub your cropped head, but that won't make the truth a lie." "Wot a bantam .it is!" sneered Lack. "Crow again, my cock" ,!" Then to Margaret: "This ugly little 'un, I expect, belongs to the king. -If I was Charles, I'd throw him to the lions in the Lions' Tower." "' Thus far," responded Margaret, "1he has proved my friend i and I entreat you to let me go with him, and for thee kindness you shall always find a round of beef and a mug qf ale at the Barley Mow." "That's wery sensible talk," rejoined Lack, thoughtfully; '.and if it weren't for others; you'd soon be on the way to your father's inn, A round of beef, when 'un is hungry, is a werry good thing. A mammnnoth. pasty the same. A mug of ale, ditto. But if you're sharp-and you've got-a sharp eye- 'you know enough to give inconvenience to one .as. can't be named here. There's 'eads among us that, might be cotched in baskets. Again, there's 'eads among us that might be -cotched in ropes 1" Lack Billson drew his right forefinger slow. 1y across his neck with a meaiing grimace. ; ." I have understood nothing' of your 8s- crets;" protested Margaret.   . Lack blew up his face with inspeakable incredulity., '         , ' .   "The cat is well out of the bag, and you saw which way it. jumped," responded the vagrant, with a knowing leer. Just then a man entered abruptly. His face was harsh and strongly marked, his fig- ure awkward and somewhat meagre.   He, closed: the door hastily, and demanded hur- riedly . -  "Have you seen Monmsuth? That plot- ting Jeffrey's I fear, has ruined us 1" Margaret crouched behind the large chair. She. felt a -secret terror of this sudden visitor. The vagrant stood embarrassed and silent. He seemed placed ih a position from which he knew no means of immediate extrication. He made grotesque pantomime to the new-comer, who was too much engrossed to heed it., "Speak, you villain!" added the man. "My life hangs on a thread. A  paper has been stolen. Monmouth has risked all to re- cover it. If he has failed, there will be work for Leecheraft!" "More'eads in baskets I Lord have mercy on us!" exclaimed Billson. "Out upon thee, knaveI Such heads as thine will never become acquainted with the axe. Who will take the trouble to look for Lack Billson, the vagrant, when noblergame is afoot? Thou art but the servile instrument of a purpose far above thy comprehension. A  noble hand plays for a stalke paramount to gold. Strolling vagabond! What is a rob. bery, now and then, of some great lord or lady, but a passing jest, a momentary won- der, to set the inquisitive agape? There is something more than the hue and cry of the White and the Black; though, i' faith, the lark has been right bravely played. All London is open-mouthed with vulgar won- der!" He paused, and rubbed the palms of his hands together abstractedly. "Go on, Master Ferguson, go on! Di- wulge all you know! Let out your wiolence. Your secrets, moreover. Don't look at me  when I mFake warious dewices to attract your attention, .Go right on a conversin' afore strangers! Don't mind that arms and head in the corner!"' Billson pointed at Grub. "Don't mind that young ooman ahind the chair! Not at all. Not in the least. Like- wise. Notwithstan'in'. Also!" Lack Billson puffed his cheel;s, sunk his nose, and- looked irreparably injured.  "Damn this darkness!" muttered Fergu- son, looking vaguely about., the, dim cell. "Ho;, ho I., There's that- arch-devil, Grub I Why didn't you speak, Billson, before the murder was out? But I'll soon make an end of him. We can cast his misshapen .carcase into the moat or the Thames.' Ferguson drew his sword, and tooak a step g   Ur JlU NlO1JU W   Jt LL.       * - toward the dwarf, with the evident purpose of running liim through, but'was brought to a sudden pause by the sight of a large holster- pistol, held in one of the long hands of Grub. "Come on I come on!" he howled. "We'll see which can travel the fastest, steel or lead. Ho, ho! My name is Grub, Grub, Griub! Call me devil, Bob; call me devill I can have you drawn 'on a hurdle, Bob Ferguson, and' your head'cut' off,andryour body quar- tered and hung up, one piece over the Trai- tor's Gate, anotheron LoSndon Bridge, another at Tower Hill, and another' at Tyburn I I'm Satan, Satan, Satan!" The dwarf laughed frightfully. Ferguson drew back, and dropped the point of his sword to the floor. "I know you! I know: you!" shouted Grib. "You are full of plotting and intrigue. You live atfthree different places in London. .You dodge and you skulk. I've seen you go in and out. When you want monay, you get it. How do you get it? Ha, ha! Ask Grub, Grub, Grub!

A man with his head off is not a head taller than Grub. Ho, ho!" The dwarfs shrill laugh made Margaret tremble, as she cowered behind the chair. "This thing is from hell!" muttered Fer- ,guson. "True, true, true I They're inquiring down. there for- Robert Ferguson. If your time wasn't short, I'd send you now. I'm tempted to shoot you through the aentre of. the brain. Nobody can shoot like Grub. Call me devil,; call me devil 1" "He's a wulture and a wampire!" mur- mured Billson. "He makes me shiver and quiver like a lump of jelly. Let me go, Mas- ter Ferguson, and I'll be content with aiwa- cated kennel and the perminsauods wittles.' "Peace I -peace!" said Ferguson, sheathing his sword. "Put up your pistol, Satan, and I will buy your silence with gold." "Buy my silence with gold!" mimicked Grub. "I have heaps of gold, already  I have hoarded it away; not that I care for it, but that I may laugh at the fools who barter their soulsafor it.

Mrs. Crowfoot favored him with a depre- eating glance. - What was all this to a wom- an who hadn't slept for forty year?

I'll be shot if you a'n't too soft and female in your systum to stan' up and bear the rubs and brushes of a campaign"  '  Mrs. Crowfoot deigned to turn her sleepless orbs on the counterfeit youth. She inspected him from his tangled looks to his indifferently shod feet. Something was working in her brain,though not very powerfully. Moll made herself as busy as possible with the hot water and other:ingredients. The conversation had takenaan unwelcome direction. "'IYour hands," observed Bab, "' might be like a girl's, if clean. It's strange that a Dick Slicer should, have, jist. such hands. You haven't hurt yourself with work, Dick.. You needn't say you'vei hurt;. yurself,.with work, What with my wakefulness, and what with: my perponderatin's on the law, and what with my reflections generally,;and what with ,my turn- in's and twistin's, .seekin' sleep and repose,   'there isn't many as can come up to me in the way of a judgment and a opinion. Your mother. must a been a unfortinit ereetur who had seen better days." - . "Ingulphus," said Moll, in a tone of con- viction, " do you see how :she gets at things? She searches a chap as if'she was a'eye-stone agoin' through the miid arter a mote. True, every word on't!" Moll' presented Bab with a tin cup of the steaming mixture she had by this time made. She received it grimly, and finding it too hot, submitted to have it cooled with more of the contents of the bottle. Hutch willingly ac- cepted the same favor, and hob-a-nobbed with the old woman. The effects were characteris- tic. The man that was so stabbed and jabbed grew fierce, talked savagely, and wanted to quarrel with somebody; while Crowfoot see- sawed more -violently, and grew harder and harder on the law and those who tamely yield- ed to its restraints. Glasspoolf shaped her conversation to the humors of both, and gradually drew them to the subject of her thoughts-Kyte Linkliorn. "It's a pity," she said, "that something couldn't be made of him." " Who?" queried Crowfoot, curtly. "The informer as is down below," answered Moll. Hutchi suggested that he might be made into " sassingers." He believed he had eaten '"Roundhead sassingers." He mildly squeak- ed his chanter on- the back of this belief. "Go away with your heathen notions!" re- torted Crowfoot, severely. "I'd have you to feel that the Crow's Nest is a respectable place. G o. away, you haeked-up choppin'- block, "  "This journeyman," added Moll, interpos- ing to prevent a serious disagreement, " knows the ins and outs of the Three Dials." "Well?" snarled the sleepless woman. "Supposin' he does?" "( Who can fit a key like the watchmaker's man 9 - Who can lay his hand on the swag like the watchmaker's man?" GlasspoQl spoke like one plunged in inter- eating and useful meditation. "If the .watchmaker's man," cried Mrs. Crowfoot, " knew the ins and the outs of the Three Dials a. hundred times better nor he does; if the watchllmaker's man knew how to fit a key a hundred times better; if the watch- maker's man could lay his hands on the swag a hundred times better, it wouldn't be of no manner of use to him, nor me, nor you, nor :nobody I Let him mould on his straw! Let him .grow damp on .his straw!; Let him grow cold, cold on his straw!" A. baleful light glowed in the eyes of the sleepless woman.: Her own spirit and the 'ru n-and-water spirit flamed up together. She   pendulated, her lank :body from, side to side, in the fervor of her tmalice.- ,  , ,vswag is swag,"'. muttered Hutch, ;"'no mat. ter who gits it or vere'it comes from.,- There's heaps of tickers at the Three Dials that might be mwested in the 'Crow's 'Nest, . - Go and git 'em, then!", said Bab., .

She - hoped his erratic mind would soon go off, on. another track. She knew that desperate men were associated with him and this vagrant clan. The consequences of' falsehood-to the few and simple regulations of, the beggarly crew, were visited with vengeance secret and terrible.

MATTERS' AT THE eROW'S NEST. ;asck Billson, began, tpo yield to the power of his potations. He,experienced a heaviness qiuite unusual, but talked oa in a discursive manne, 'He, retained sufficient sense to be suspipiou, manifesting :acuriosity ,coinern- ing,Diqk Slicer that ,he ,had not. before dis- played, , He .drew up to. the .crippled table, ,andc rambled;on. with 'thick utterance:.

Isn't all the weavers o' Spittalfields aweavin' for me?              , ," "ack shut his eyes and seemedvastly con-   tent. He opened themn suddenly, and looked  severely at the bogus Slicer.;  , "Wot be you hauntin' the Crow's-Nestfor, little 'un?. Who knows you? :What do you ,wan't?. Come, sir, we must understand this I Be ye goin' to jine the Free and United Wa- grunts? 'Be ye. goin' to leave the, wanities outside, and nap your fingers at Work and trade, arid all the follies o' life?", , :  " That's what I'm, reachinm' aftefir," ,Ml said. .      .;   "'I wouldn't take my oath of that.: You may be a little willain.; Youlook to'me'like a little willain." His cheeks went out, and' his nose went in. He struck the table with his clenched hand. "You're hard on a cove!" 'remonstrated Dick. , "You're hard on a :ove as wants to rise. How can a cove rise when you're hard on him?" "'Look. here, you wiciousness! Did you ever hear of spies among the Free and United 'Wagrunts?" Lack stared steadily at Dick Slicer.: "Served 'em right P', stammered the latter. "1No business to done it.". . "You're a downy 'un "' retorted Billson, who was now .obliged to yawn very often, and whose ill-humor increased with his intoxica- tion, "Gi' me some!"  He pushed his cup toward Moll, who replenished it. He drained it, and presently his chin' began to. settle up- on his chest, 'He had several spells of resus- citation before finally succumbing. He start- ed up frequently with various: ennnciatory remarks: "Confound you, boy! what you doin'? You're a wanity and a wexation! Don't'look at that trap-door.; This adwice hear: ." Mind your own business, 'Don't 'meddle with things 'below. You're drunk, :you warmint! I'llttakerwengeance on you to- 'morrow.. Where's 'Hutch? Where's Bab? Wet ails '    nemall,? Where's the wuiltures and the wampyres?". Billson's head sank upon the table, and he was, instantly heard breathing heavily.' Ingulphus, who had muttered, occasionally, the words,"' broadsword, cutlass," etc;,' slid from his chair upon his collapsgd pipes, in consequencee of a severe struggle with ahard knot in his nose, that wouldn/t' come untied by all his efforts;, 'Mrs. Crowfoot'was in such a limp' and lax 'state, that she settled into a shape, representing the ecrescent' moon, her back being the upper segment. ', In fact, a lean doll-baby, of enormous size, dumped into a. chair, with the head pitihed -dangeroisly forward, and the; arms hanging; inert and' straight as plumb-lines;is;sa figure that may convey quite a satisfactory onception 'of the sleeping pose of the sleeplesewoman.  ,  The scheming Dick. Slicer - now seemed master of' the situation.; Butthere was not a   moment to spare. - It was: full time for the vagrant crows to come flapping to the Nest. Moll looked at one, then at another of her cup companions, and stood last by the suspi- cious Billson. She did not care to believe the wily cormorant on evidence slight and perhaps deceptive. She rattled his. cup on the thile, an[d said:  "Take some!' Take some I A'n't goin' to drop 'off..in this way, be. ye? Flicker, my cove. Sparkle. Blaze. Flame out " /, Lack would neither flicker nor blaze, sparkle nor flame out, butrattled the-string of knots that were lodged somewhere in the interior of his nasal. arrangements. Not yet satisfied, and by way of experiment, Glasspool turned something like a gill of rum on the top 'of his cropped head, little!,rooks -of which found their way to, his eyes, with no other effect than to produce a slight twitching of the red selvage. But that which was most convinc- ing, was the fact that two well-defined rivulets ran across his mouth without being'sucked up. Ml accepted this as conclusive evidence of the genuineness of his slumber, and with- out further delay, lighted a torch and com- menced the practical part of her business at the Crow's Nest. She readily found the trap, but experienced difficulty in opening it; and -it was not till after many trials and a severe tax upon her strength, that she succeeded in raising it. :It creaked vexatiously, and what was more, rang a bell directly over the wide fireplace, where Bab was flexed upon her own corp:.s, riotingin -sleep after a vigil of forty years.   E  Glasspool ran, mounted a settle, and smoth- ered the bell with her hand. .This alarum was a device entirely unsuspected by Moll. Fortunatelyit did not, in this instance, answer its purpose. With quick steps she hurried, below. She. stood on the bare -earth, at a loss in what direction to carry her investi- gations. The change of air was notable; above,-it' was warm, with a chronic impreg- nation of tobacco, and 'spirit,' and filth; be- neath, it was' like the foul emanations of a plague-ditoh. Heaps of imnfmable rubbish lay here and there; broken bottles, tatters of clothing, decaying straw, the meagre refuse of beggary and theft. The erratic yet brave Mary Ginsspool shiv- ered involuntarily, as her-eyes followed the streaming beams of her torch to the various quarters rof the den. The impulse to maike.  Inhsty retreat was strong upon her at first, but pity for Linkhorn soon gave her sufficient nerve- to proceed.' Stoutly :overcoming 'her rel,ugnance, and a certain mysterious dread that, the place inspired, she moved quickly to- ward the spot where she believed she. should find the watchmaker's man.. Never in her life had she traversed a crypt so dark and re-   pulsive. She would not have been greatly surprised had the ghosts of murdered victims risen before her. Unfortunate creatures, doubtless, had inet foul play there. She noticed several heaps of earth, and her fears readily suggested that something more than common soil could be found beneath. The Crow's Nest was too old' not to have its startling histories. She wiped the damps from her face and breathed fast. Presently ,she began to call Linkhorn; at first timidly, then in a firmer tone. It was sometime be- fore she received a response, and it came so faintly that she questioned its reality. At length the sounds wert sufficiently defined to determine. their 'origin, and to guide her to the kennel into which he had been cast, and which was sealed up, as it were, with a thick wooden door, secured without by a large bar, which was so heavy and fitted so closely, that. to slip it through the brackets put all her strength in requisition. Thrusting the socket of her torch into the ground, she set about the business with so much earnestness, that the door was soon open. Kyte Linkhorn presented a melancholy spectacle. He was lying upon some straw, greatly downeast and wilted by confinement. Fear and anxiety, in conjunction with the ex- ecrable air and bread and water, had wrought a very appreciable change in his appearance. His cheeks were pale, his eyes sunken, and his manner hopeless in the extreme. Very damp here!" muttered the journey- man. "' Very damp, indeed!" Moll perceived that his mind was somewhat unsettled. Truly it is damp. Arise, my friend, and come away."  "Do you see anything unusual about me?" asked the journeyman, looking anxiously at his visitor. Not quite comprehending him, she shook her head. "You ought to see a change," said Link- horn, dubiously. "I'm afrog, and I live at the bottom of a well. See how slimy I am! You'll hear me croak pretty soon, if you wait. As near as I can reckon, I've been at the bot- tom of this 'here well about a hundred year. I've been tryin* to hop out; but life of my body, there sn't a frog;in the world that can hop out " -" '. 1Cme, ome, om! Banish' these -fancies. You'll soon be at liberty. This way, journey- man. ' Keep at my heels and' you' shall pres- ently be beneath the clear arch of heaven." - Kyte Linkhorn,' laboring under a strong frog view of the case, got upon all fours and cut a few frog capers, manifesting a willing- -ness to follow Moll -in that particular fashion of locomotion.  "Get up, you Longlegs, and Walk like a'de-   cent Christian. This is no time for foolery!" answered Glasspool, sharply. "If you want me to stand on my hind legs, you'll be disappointed.& Inor no other frog, eat-do it. What a sight it' would be to see a frog a walkin' on -his hind legs! ;Don't ex- pect no sich dewelopments. Every cretur has his own particular movement, 'cordin' to the laws o' natur. Ha! ha! ha Go along, go along, you phantom!"  Moll began to entertain serious apprehen- sions that Kyte- Linkhiorn had gone mad; and when she considered the circumstances, and the-wretched den in which he was im- mured, she did not wonder that his mind should yield to strange and unnatural fancies. She examined him more closely. His eyes were vacant and his face meaningless. That he must be brought out of this state at once, to insure the success of -her plan, was evi- dent. He was crouching at her feet like a mammoth toad.' Clearly, he had resolved to maintain his character as an incarcerated frog; a character certainly Very difficult for Moll tomanage, as she could not, conveni- ently, in that shape, hop him out of the Crow's Nest. "Boys, quoth the journeyman, sepul- chrally, "drive frogs with sticks."  "That isn't my way," said Moll. "I drive 'em with fire!"Glasspool assumed a fierce expression, and plunged her torch full at the frog's haunches. The experiment proved eminently successful. With a roar of pain, the distraught Linkhorn sprang to his feet, and stared at Moll in unspeakable surprise. The Roaring Girl had achieved a triumph. The sudden shook diverted the morbid cur- rent of his consciousness, and restored him to something approximating to sense.  "Call in your wits," said Moll. "Remem- ber where you are, and- how you came here. If you will follow me without delay, we may be able to escape from this den of thieves." .  . "Has he come for the watch?" asked the journeyman, vaguely.   \ "How unfortunate!" exclaimed the girl; who was getting uncomfortably nervous. "Five hundred guineas!" murmured Link- horn. "It's a nice beginning. See that Red Lion street is well guarded."'  '  It was vexatiously apparent that his mind had seizel upon a fragment of memory, and was wandering unguided in the past. 'lhe young woman placed her hand on his shoulder and shook him, gently. " - , .  "Brighten, man, brighten Think of the vagrant and the Crow's Nest." "The Crow's Nest as is down in St. Giles?" said Linkhorn, vacantly.  "Yes," said Moll, eagerly, hoping to lead him gradually to the present.   ' St. Giles, as is full o' kennels and boards to sleep on, and the bare ground to sleep on, and straw wringing-wet'to sleep on." ' And vagrants," suggested Moll. "I'm a wagrant myself," quoth Litkhorn. I flops anywheres, with nothing,.under' and -with nothing atop. Does it snow t Crawl in. Does it rain? Let the rain be damned " He madte a feeble, gesture, and looked: de- :terminedly atthe girl. His thoughts were at the Barley'Mow, drinking sack with Lack Billson. "'Where's them wittles,"' he 'con- tinued, "as all Lunnon is a'oookin'? Where's the fryin'-pans, and the stew-kettles, and the ovens, and the other wessels as cooks wittles? Bring 'em, you young scamp! Lay on 'em hands of wiolence." The watchmaker frowned at Moll, and evinc- ed a disposition- to commence an assault on account of the said eatables. . "Come on," said Moll, " and we'll soon be at the victuals. Come! they are smoking- hot on the table." "Then let some of 'em as is workin' for us bring 'em!" 'cried Linkhorn. "A'n't the drudgers .a drudgin', the workers a workin', the traders a tradin', the drovers a drovin', and all the world a runnin' itself to' death for us? Don't talk to me, you smooth-faeed-'un! Don't come herewith your argyments as a'n't of no valley. Where's Billson? Where's the forty-year ha? Wot's broke loose, eh"' Moll drew him forward by the arm. Her pulses were flying fast with apprehension. She expected momentarily to hear the tread of feet over her head. Should she leave the poor fellow to his fate? She had not the heart to abandon him. "Bab Crowfoot is after us, and we' must get away from her," she said. "Bring her on! I should like to fight her. I'd soon spot her dial for her, the old wixen 1" Kyte doubled his 'fists and ;made ready to '" square off" to give punishment.  Moll hethought her of a last expedient. She advanced her face to his' ear, and pro- nounced the' name of Jenty :Mandrake. It struck on his pilgrim senses like the knell of a' bell on a sensitive ear. - He started:and rubbed his forehead with an uncertain move- ment. "Who said that?" he murmured. "Jenty waits for you. /Let us go to her," added Moll, with earnestness. . . "I'll go. 'But stop a minute.. What's the matter? -Has anything happened ti '" ' "Heaven be praised! He shows a little -reason at last." She held the link nearer his pale face, hop- ing to catch some gleam of returning reason. His sunken eyes were, indeed, struggling with the darkness of incoherency, and gradually lighting up with coniing memories,   "- ,The movement;" he,said, with an effort'to Ib beUaid, " is out o' order,: Touch the regu- lator'; set it forrard sa trifie.

She stood with him at the foot of the steps. She ,urged him to ascend; but his mind wavered again, andlhe staggered from weakness. The friendly girl, seeing his physical inability, ran up the .stairs and re- turned with: the bottle she had left on the ta- ble. It still contained about two gills of spirit. ".Drink!" said Moll. "Drink! It will, perchance, put life and energy into you." ; Ky te caught at the bottle ilike a drowning man, and drained it to the last. drop before it !oleff his tips, H e let it fall upon the ground, when, itwas emptied with a sigh pf inexpres- sible gratification. :She watched himanxlous- ly.

"'What ip to be done?" asked Linkhorn, on i whose chilledframe, deadened virculation, and 1   cramped limbs the liquor had, acted most po- tently     . "I know not," answered Moll, pressing a hand to her beating heart. "There is but One who knows, and He is that One who keeps his own counsels. He never tells, Kyte Link- horn!"

I "I would that we could close the trap," said Moll; "but awea cannot. Some of the brood have already reached the Nest. This torch will betray us at'once, if we remain here. Let us. hide ourselves in some remote corner. If we can do no more, we will at least defer-the catastrophe as long as possible." She moved from the immediate vicidity of the trap; and the watchmaker mechanically followed her. Having reached the most ob- scure part of the crypt, Moll paused to re- flect and ,decideupon .some course of action. "This is kind of you, Mistress Mary," said Linkhorn, in a subdued voice. "I confess as X wasn't prepared for so much friendliness from ypou." ! "I dare. say not. Not muich good have you heard of me,. I'll, warrant, I know what is said:; Jk now hpwlmy name is bandied from tongue: t6;: tongue. I Iknow that my name is passed tand (fro ,like ia shuttlecock." She stopped an instant, then added: "Well, I i.4Tvo deservod :it. J:tisrwhat I knew would follow my wild freaks. .t don't profess to be better than I an.. W hat matters talk?

"You have heard what ,others have never heard from the lips of Moll Pool. Let it drop. Inthis world itis impossible to discriminate the good from the bad. There isbut One in the vast streter   of time and space who can say: 'This is a- good man That is a bad woman.' What a time there will be when the judgers are judg- ed I," Moll ceased speaking, and bent her head to listen to the sounds above. ' The foul birds are coming in," she said. "How are we to avert distinction? These are birds of prey. Treachery is the signal object of their wrath and vengeanee. I need not tell you, my friend, that our lives are in great danger. Bab Crowfoot and Lack Bill- son will, by-and-by, come out of their dull sleep. They are drugged. I drugged them to liberate you. But before they awake, the open trap-door will very likely attract suspi- cion." The journeyman sat down on a box and trembled. The realization of his situation was too much 'for his weak nerves to bear calmly. She f-eared -he would relapse to his former insanity. It was impousible to be more awkwardly placed. She sensed fully the dif- uiculties that surrounded -her. Mary Glass- pool had more than the ordinary fortitude of her sex, but she was far .from willing to resign her hold upon sublunary things. For her, as for all young persons, existence had its Tharms. 'She was happy in her own way and fashion. If her way and fashion were unlike the way and fashion of others, the pecu- liarity was ingrained, and arose from the tem- per of her making up. Stie shraak with ter- ror from the thought of dying in a kennel of thieves, vagrants, and wayside assassins. Her. mission to the Crow's Nest had been one odf mercy, stimulated, it is true, by a love of adventure. '"Watchmaker's man," she said, anon, " you mustgo back to your burrow, and be shut up." Linkhorn stared at her mournfully, and muttered something about the cold and the damp     .  "A hole in this earth will 'be 'colder and damper," she -answered, pointing downward with her finger. ' "Do you- think as they above would have I the heart? 'The heart as to go and do it?" His voice quavered "If they faltered, the hag -Crowfoot would hound them on:' ' But there is my friend Billsou. 'He won't allow it. A man as is so lively and so jolly won't see us murdered." "Hte has but one voice. He cannot with- stand fifty, even if his good-nature should tri- umph over the callousness of his perverted nature. There is good in him, and there is eVi, too. Put not your trust in him. Rely on yourself and me. Babis thoroughly wicl- ed. Ingulphus Hutch, Kitty Gracchus, and a dosen others, are her willng instruments. rtgkP   A wild burst of laughter rolled down into the cellar. The vagrants were amusing them- selves with the somniferous condition of the three sleepers. "They'll wake 'em up P" groaned Linkhorn. "It'll soon be allover with us. I wish the devil had those same five hundred guineas. Ah I lenty, Jenty!" "That is well, my friend; think of Jenty. The thought of your sweetheart will, per- chance, give you courage." "I might been sittin' at my shelf at the Three 'Dials, adjustin' the movements, a rumi- natin' on pmy love, and a sayin' to myself: 'We'll be married this day six months, or this day year, or this day -a dozen year, as the case might be. A bein' don't know when he is 'appy, till summat 'has 'appened to him. I wish the masked robber had swallowed his watch instead o' bringin' it to me. The ex- pectation of money takes away a poor man's senses." "Listen 1 The crows are rummtging the Nest. Bab Crowfoot will not have a bottle of sack nor a draught of ale by morning. There will be a drunken revel. The saints shield us from their fury when they become maddened by intoxication I My friend, you will be safest in your den." ,Good Moll I Sweet Mary Glasspool! Don't speak of it. Don't ask me to crawl into the reekin' cold and the deadly damp. If you do, my mind will stagger again and the wheels 'll stop." Kyte arose and stood beseechinglybdefore her, his tall, lank figure bowed, his pale .lips quivering. "Nay! Be a man. Your safety requires this sacrifice of your -feelings."'  Again fastened in that miserable place of darkness, nothing will be left me but to die there." "' Hear me I I will leave one end of the bar out of the socket, that you may push open the door, in case no one comes to your relief." Linkhorn sighed and shook-his head. He wondered that Mary Glasspool could stand there. so calmly, with a vision of death before her eyes. There was a difference in human nature.; some could do what others could not. He secretly confessed that he had not the cool, philosophbeal courage of the girl before him, The spirit was glowing in his stomach; it wai shooting spasms of life into his benumbed system. It was to her that he owed this' em- porary elevation from his pitiful fanciei. She assumed, most suddenly, a new'and surprising interest in his eyes. He considered her fiace and person with a curiosity almost childish. If there had been no Jenty Mandrake, he would have fallen at the feet of Mary Glao- pooL The raw spirit warmed, and thrilled, and :    flamed within him. It drove out the damps and the cold, and battled stoutly with weak- ness, hunger, and-his constitutional timidity.. "You will leave one end of the bar out of the bracket?" he said, looking steadily into her dark eyes. Rely upon it," said Glasspool. "It would be a dreadful, dreadful thing to deceive me " said the journeymnn. "It would be frightful if I should try the door and find it fastened. I should go mad; mad in- deed!" "I have periled my life for you," answered Mary. "And it is for that that I yield. There is no one else as could overcome me. Mistress, put me where you will. If I should come outs again-if the dreadful damps, if the poisonous sweat of the earth, if the penetrating cold should conquer, tell Jenty Mandrake that the watchmaker-the watchmaker as worked at a little shelf at the Three Dials-thought of her till the end was come-till the end was come and gone, and there was no more of him but a clod as they plant in the ground."  A loud shout of merriment billowed down the trap-door, making the journeyman recoil with apprehension. Moll conducted him to the place from which she had so recently released him, and whispering words of encouragement, pushed him in and closed the door, adhering strictly to her promise not to fasten it. But Link- horn doubted. He softly tried it, to see if it would open, and perceiving that it would, could with difficulty repress a cry of gladness. "Tell me as you are there?" he whispered, eagerly. "Yes; I am here." Just then, she heard the drone of a bagpipe. Evidently they had dragged Hutch out of his 'lethargy, and were forcing him to play. The  notes arose like random shots at first, but presently grew wild and exhilarating. In- gulphus could pipe asleep or awake. There came a dead thumping upon the floor, which i anon grew violent. The sweep and shuffle of feet; the racing and running of exuberant dancers; the leaps and ascents of uncontrolla- ble revelers; the concerted swirl of bodies through the figures, together with the various impromptu violences and excitements of the  dance, made the complaining floor shake and ] tremble.                ] "You can take the torch," said Moll. "I shall be safer without it If any one comes  to you, extinguish it." Linkhorn thrust out his hand and received the torch with great satisfaction. It would i relieve the gloom of his narrow lair, and a make him feel that he yet had a hold on the  world. "Remain here quietly. If I can steal up c   1 unperceived, close the trap, and join the - dancers, all may yet be well. I shall make .the attempt, and if I succeed, be assured that you shall not be forgotten. My werd for-it, you shall see Jenty Mandrake before'un'x sng. if my plan succeeds." "And if you do not succeed?" queried Linkhorn. "In that case, I trust you will meet her in a brighter city than London." "I feel that it will be in heaven if any- where," faltered the poor watchmaker, whose physical weakness make him extremely doubt. ful of any kind of good luck. Glasspool groped her way to the steps and paused. The sack and the ale were doing the busi- ness for the tatterdemalions of the Crow's Nest. A rollicking madness had gotten into their vagrant legs. Such hopping and skip- ping, such prancing and curvetting, such bounding and pouncing, were never seen nor. heard before. The shouting and tramping had reached a jolly height, when an accident occurred that changed the entire order of things. An ambitious dancer, seizing his 'air partner, dashed off on a longer run than usual, and passing the given limits, rushed blindly to the open trap, adown which both disappearedwith astonishing suddenness. The adventurous pair were heard bumping upon the steps, and finally in the depths below. A chorus of reckless, laughter followed upon the heels of this casualty. The merry beggars were soon chattering, jibing, and asking ques- tions, all at once, in a dense circle around the itrap. The clamor aroused Bab Crowfoot, who, straightening her bent old body, popped from her chair like a cork from a bottle, de- manding shrilly what was the matter. No one answering this question definitely, she cleared the rheum of sleep from her eyes with her apron, and rushed among the noisy crew. "What ye cacklin' at, ye beggars! Have you laid a golden egg? If you have, let me see it, for it'll be the first blessin' you've 'brought to the Crow's Nest, you loiterin' louts! Ho, ho! Who opened this door? What business have ye with the door?" "Curse your door!" muttered the unlucky one who had fallen with his partner, as he came limping up the steps. "Left it open a purpose, didn't ye, so somebody would break his neck." "You're a fool," retorted Bab, " to run in- to a hole bigger'n a table! Hutch-Billson -some of you-bring a torch." Billson raised his head and yawned, then went to sleep again so quick that he fairly slipped through the old woman's fingers. Hutch bestirred himself and got a torch. "Touch it to that drowsy knave's nose " ordered Mrs. Crowfoot. The too faithful In-   gulphus obeyed, and was knocked down for his pains ; and there was so much lead in him that he found it difficult to arise. "Peradwenture," said Lack, "you'll try that experiment ag'inl It's easy enough, old choppin'-block, to clap a torch to acove's nose, a'n't it? When you wants another broose to put on hexibition, make happli- cation to your wagrunt. Stabs, moreover. Jabs, also. Cutlasses, notwithstan'ih'. Swords, nevertheless!" Mr. Billson blew up his face till it looked like the twin of an inflated bladder; while his nose resembled a cock's comb, sandwitched 'between two enormous cutlets of beef. "It was a slip of the hand," said Hutch, apologetically. "It'll be a slip o' the wind yet ifyou doesn't leave off such wanities," quoth the vagrant. "Hillo!' Wot's the dewelopments? Wot's the hellebulloo?" "Wake up, you poppy-head! Anybody'd think you'd took laudlelum with your supper.. You'might as well be a toad in the mud, as to doze away the time in this stupid fashion. Think o' one as hasn't slept for forty year." "If you haven't slept this blessed night, I'm damned!" answered Billson, with some energy. "It's a shame and a scandal to say so!" vociferated Bab. "Come to me at any hour o' the still watches, and you'll find me awake." "Excuse me, but I'd rayther not," said Mr. Billson. "Where's Dick Slicer, you wicious wretch?" "The devil carried him off about a hour ago," replied Lack, definitely. "He bolted him through the ceilin', as a hungry wagrunt would bolt a apple dumplin'. He went out o' sight. He disappeared. He wanished, also." "Back, ye cormorants r" screamed the sleepless woman. "Back to your dancin' and pipin'. Away, ye thriftless brood! What care ye save for your stomachs, and your frolickin', and your sleep. One forlorn cree- tur has to lbok arter ye, as if you's so many children." The tattered crowd fell back a little, but were too much under the influence of sack and ale to yield entire obedience to Mrs. Crowfoot. Each, from the least to the great- est, improvised some peculiar noise, from the mewing of a cat to the howling of a dog. It was a most interesting performance by the whole strength of the speckled group. Little wretches, whose uncombed hair hung nearly to their feet, joined impishy in this Tartar- ean chorus. Old sinners, whose wrists and ankles were calloused by companionship with the stocks, and whose way was toward Ty- burm,.roared and cat-called with the young- est of the unwashed and half-fledged vaga- hondlP   Bab snatched the torch from Hutch, and swirling it around at the full length of her shriveled arm, and diving forward her head until it was nearly at a right. angle with her shoulders, glared at her irreverent and rebel- lious lodgers with all the fury of a malign witch. "Beggars! thieves! knaves!" she yelled. "I see what ye've been at. I see my sack in your red eyes. Ye've robbed me, wretches! Is this the way ye pay for the shelter I give ye? Do ye bite the hand that saves ye from the law?" She plunged her torch at some of the nearest, by way of underscoring the emphatic words. One received a charred nose, another a smutch in the mouth, while a. third threw out a smell of singed hair. "Many of ye are due to the law, and ought to be paid. Due, and will be paid! Due, and wil be paid soon. Due to the sure cord and the short shrift. DUE! Ha, ha! Ho, ho I Hell-brood " Bab stopped, with distended mouth and hurried breath; she churned her torch up and down in her right iand, clutching the air with her uplifted left. The more timid shrank from her some were sullen, while the more hardened grinned and grimaced. "Werry good I Wrry wiwacious! Give 'em another wolley," said Mr. Billson, en- couragingly. \ Bab thrust him through with her eyes; then, with another withering glance at her va- grant family, dived down the steps with all the precipitation her limbs would allow. CHAPTER XXIII. THE C ROWS OF ST. GILES. The young woman who had fallen was sit- ting on the fourth step, rocking her body and wringing her hands over a fractured knee. In her haste and blindness of her rage, Mistress Crowfoot tilted against her, and shot head fore- most to the bottom of the cellar, falling in a very scattered and sprawling manner. Small misfortunes are always laughed at, and this instance of the fallilility of human legs was no exception to the rule. A thun- derous peal played on the gamut of fifty va- ried voices, shook every stick of the Nest, and poured oil on the flame of Bab's wrath, which, being too great for expression, she contented herself by pendulating her left claw at them, and then speeding away on her errand. "Treachery and treason!" she muttered, on reaching the door of the black-hole, and perceiving one end of the bar out of the brack- et. Hutch and Billson were at her heels. She fumbled at the door with hands quivering with doubt and fear; she flung it open. First, a blazing. light- flashed in her eyes, then a great meteor of fire darted into her face. She   reeoiled with a shriek of pain and fell back- ward, bewildered and astounded. Immediately -a lank and 'spectral figure sprang out of the crypt, bounded over the prostrate hag, upset Hutch and Billson by the. forces of his, momentum, and' ran wildly up the stairs. It was Kyte Linkhorn. His ghastly face, his sunken; and staring eyes, the disorder of his person, together:mtli his in- sane and startling movements, struck the beg- gars, dmb with amazement; Had Linkhorn availed himself of the momentary panic, he might have made his way to the street, and fled from the dangers of St. Giles. '* Seize him! ;seize him!" screamed Crow- feot from the cellar. ,Sttop him--stop him, on vour lives-J"          , lieantly a dnoe khiyves -and dagers were drawn from  as, many ragged hiding-glaces- and held ready for- use. A stout fellhow bys name Kilty Grachus, placed himself before the only avenue of escape from the Nest, and  seowling feroiously, made an ugly panto- mime with a rusty dagger.   .  The watchmaker threw a terrified glance around him, and dropping his torib fell upon  his knees,                c ,"looid peopile, im he stammered-and not I mowring what next to say, stopped, a nd made h a new  attempt: "orthy beggars--noble I beggars-kind beggars'-here hi voice was a drowned by hoots of derision.

I'm not an informer.. I came here at first for a lark; but to-night I came with the intention of setting this poor man at liberty. You never would have been complained of or disturbed through my means. It was a needless piece of cruelty to shut. up and endanger the life of this honest watch, maker. I'm sorry that I have not been sue. cessful. As for the matter of murder, I ad- vise you to think twice before you commit the crime. There are those who will take the trouble to inquire after Dick Slioer-those who can crush such vermin as youi,as one crushes an egg-shell in his hand. Know one thing: I will die as bravely as I have lived. I will show you a trick or two before. I stop breathing, that it will. be worth your while to see." Moll flung off the hand of Ingulphua Hutch, who was holding her by the arm, and retreat, ing a few stepsi placed her back asainst the stone masonry ofthegaping fire-place. where it jutted out, spanning one side of the hearth. In a, twinling, she drew two pistols from the breast of her doublet, one of which she point. ed at the blake ned visage of Bab Crawo6ot and the other at the jolly face of Lack Bill. son.  "Two. of you, my coves, are ticnsted to the devil. Good Bab, give the word toyour beg- gars, and you'll be with your father in a mo. mient,'" A  dead silence feis on the crows of -S. Giles Every thief of them was: taken by surprise, Bab gasped and swallowed, worked her chin, and stretched her, mouth. She had no wibh to -undertake the journey hinted at by: Dick Slieer. - She would have made a  covert mo- tion for the reprobates to fall on him with   their weapons ; but there, was 'a bright black eye fastened on her, admonisbing to pru. 4ance. Linkhorn crawled between Moll's feet for safety. "Here's a wexation!" said Billson, mildly. '( Stand back, you wagrunts, Put up your weepons, and be civil.

"Fear not," said Bab. "No one: shall fol. 'low you." Billson planted his short, burly figure aP the foot of, the stairs. Moll and Lihorn asceeded quickly, opened the. door, and lur, ried out.

Lack braced Linkhorn carefully againsithe knocker; and turning to Moll, said, after two inflations of his face antd two particular losses of his nose: "Laudlelum, you- dog! Ladulelum, you wiciousness! Laudleum, you wagabone!" The humorous vagrant leered so knowingly that Moll could not repress a smile. "Another insiniwation. Hear! Listen! Attend, likewise I Give heed, moreover; A friend' is a friend w'erever you find him, and whoever he is. If a dog is your friend, it's a good thing. If a man or boy is your friend, it's a good thing.

THE RIDE   TO HOUNSLOW. Margaret Gurther, on being drawn through the secret door by Grub, found herself in to- tal darkness. "Come' along," said the dwarf. "The pas sage is narrow. Put out your hands and you'll feel the wall on either side. Follow, my pretty." Obeying his directions, Margaret groped after him. "It's lucky to have stout arms and a good wit," continued Grub. "You see, I'm more -than a match for the six-footers. It is cun- ning that conquers." "Have we far to go?" asked Margaret. "But a short distance. We shall soon be clear of the wall of the Tower." Notwithstanding this assurance, the way seemed tediously long to the young woman. Excitement and exertion were already telling upon her strength.' It was with much effort that she managed to keep pace with her tire- less conductor. Although she had strong reasons for believing in the fidelity of the dwarf, a doubt occasionally disturbed her. She realized but too-vividly that she was en- - tirely at his mercy. That he weas'capricious, was evident. A sudden whim taking posses- sion of his erratic brain, might destroy her hopes of liberty. Possibly, he was leading her unwary feet into some terrible pitfall The malignity of dwarfs was proverbial. While she was distressing -herself with re- fleetions of this character, she heard him un- lock a door; and, to her joy, saw the feeble: shimmer of light. "1 There are three steps here," said Grub. "Don't tumble down 'em, my handsome. Perhaps: you'd like my arm.  Ho, ho!. Wouldn't it be a rare sight to see you walk- ing with Grub, Grub, Grub! I shall have a wife one of; these days, mistress. Perhaps H shall make love to you. I'm famous at mak- ing love. What a husband for somebody!. Ho, hoe!" ," Don't, don't!" said Margaret, with a dep- recating gesture.- "Do I make you afraid? You are not the   first fair one I have made afraid. They all g are afraid of Grub. Call me devil, dear "  Margaret, descending the three steps, di- verged a little to the left, then making an-, other abrupt turn, according to the move- ments of her guide, reached the place from whence the light emanated. It was a large open space, with a lantern hanging in the centre. "This looks like a stable," said Margaret. "What it looks like, it is," replied Grub. Margaret, looking straight before her, saw three stalls and three horses. She observed that one was white, another re4, and the third black as a coal. She was at once struck by the size and beauty of these animals. "Which is the finest?"Grub asked. "It is impossible to decide," she answered. "Then we'll take the first that comes to hand," returned the dwarf, unfastening the white one, which was nearest. While the, innkeeper's daughter looked on with curiosi- ty, Grub saddled and bridled the steed, dart- ing under the horse's flanks to adjust the girths, fnd scrambling upon his neck to put on the bridle. To all these monkey antics the horse 'submitted with exemplary patience. He permitted the manikin to dart between his fore-leg sand his hind-legs, and commit nu- merous audacities that put Margaret in fear. She momentarily expected to see the noble creature lay hold of him with his mouth, or strike him dead with his iron-shod feet. 1"What is his naine?' she asked, hoping to divert him from his daring tricks. "Diabolus, my dove! A sweet name, my -love!"And the little imp perched between his ears, and swinging off, hung by his short legs under his- neck ; then, by a sharp cry. caused him to rear and stand frightfully erect. He glided over the broad chest, dropped on his back, and lay grinning under the sus- pended forefeet. "You think he'llkillme,' don't you' But he won't. Diabolus won't. He's a devil, and I'm a devil. Ho, ho! Down, devil, down!" i I Diaboluts came down gently, placing a great hoof each side of the bloated head. "I've lived and slept with Diabolus. - He'll leave his master to come at my call." ', Who is his master?"', Grub sprang up angrily, and rqn menacing- lytoward Margaret. "What's that to you  What do you ask questions for? Can't you be still' Can't you be a woman without having a woman's tongue? You've been thinking!" "No, I haven't!" she protested, alarmed at his vehemence-though, triuth to own, she had been thinking. a Don't lie! don't lie to a devil. I saw the thoughts in your head. You've been putting this and that together. Don't put things to-   gether. You'd better stop putting things to- gether!" He shook his long arms at Margaret. "I was a fool to do a good. action. Men nor manikins never gain anything by good actions. Confess, you black.-eyed witch I'1 Margaret fell on her knees. ** Good Grub! kind Grub t" He interrupted'her fiercely.       - I shall have to kill you. Which way will you die? Come I you shall die easy. It's a good thing to die easy." He caught her by the wrist, and held it so hard that she shrieked with pain. G"You don't want to die, eh?You want to live a long time, don't you? Swear, then." "1 will! I will!" gasped Margaret, totally unprepared for this dangerous mood. "You will say nothing of the three horses -the black, the white, and the red. If you should be racked joint from joint, you'll be silent?" "eI ,will! I will " responded Margaret trembling violently. "You are sure? ' "Don't doubt it.! don't doubt it!" ( If it wasn't for that woman's tongue!" he muttered. "It would be safety to cut out that tongue. But I'll trust it for once. Down, Diabolus, down! Crumble! crum- ble!" After tossing his head a moment, and mak- ing some false motions, the horse went on his knees. Grub seized Margaret by the waist, and lifted her to the saddle' with astonishing quickness, then vaulted on before her, perch- ing on the pommel like an overgrown beetle. Diabolus recovered his feet, instantly. These sudden demnonstrations could not but bewil- der the younig woman. The horse walked a few yards through a dimly-lighted way, and stopped. The dwarf hopped. to his feet, and standing on the smooth, round pommel, grasped a eorxd that depended from above. Pulling this cord, a large gate slowly opened. Dropping back to his seat, he rode from beneath the mysterious portal into the street. Margaret glaneed-around'her in extreme amazement. Behind her was the wall of the Tower, and beyond it the Tower itself, loom- ing up in the gray of morning. "Hold on tight," said Grub. "Take hold of my arms,: My arms are stout as iron bars. Clutch 'em fast; they won't break nor pull out at the shoulders. .Diabolus is going to bolt." With. considerable reluctance, .Margaret grasped the dwarf as she-wns bidden. The horse danced, backed, champed his bit;, snort- ed, and spraog away up Tower street, along  Eastcheap, into King William street, and thundered through Thames street, at a pace   that nearly took away Margaret's breath. After that, she lost all knowledge of street and plies. She saw lights, and buildingsg ansqu area ,fiing dizzily pot; and, dread- folY righteRed, lung to the misshapen being t whe guidanc she had- been so errngely committed. The few pedeseleans abroad at that early hour paused in wonder A they swept on. erme Motnte she -expetd to bd the rown from. her sest and dahed to the ground.

'I You see before you the masked robber-of Hounslow Heath; so deliver, or you. are a- dead man!" As he pronounced these significant words, the man on the black horse observed that the pistols were shraking in his, bands, "Pardon  me, good air," quoth'Nightshade, "if the terror of your presenes deranges my wits somewhat, and prevents, prompt conpli- ance with: your wishes.

After the rough treatment he had received; Dyce Hungerford& could but give way to some natural expressions of anger and disappoint- ment. When h' had ventilated hisfeelings, he took a more: philosophical view of the sub. ject, and. waited patiently, further develop- ments, At; thet expiration of an hour, ti6e dungeon door was unlocked, and the oolorleu face of Leecheraft looked in upon him; . "My   lord," he, said, with his, mockins smile, "I  scarcely knew you. What witf masquerading, what with barbarous disguises, what with intriguoa. and- mysteries, and what with the devil knows what, my intellects ar, well nigh turned upside doi "  It is not to bbewonderedisat,' relied Hut. gerford, dTyly. "You might have: given me gentler treatment, however."  "How could I, my lord, without betraying y ou?

Leechrafte's smile. grew more defied and  more, ghastly. "I thank you, and trust Heaven will guard me from your handiwork.   Co me; what can you tell me "   "First, I should like to be/informed of what your lordship is desirous of knowing?" "Isi he here?" "A There are many shes, my lord," returned Leeeheraft. "Do not provoke me  You know well whom IA mean. I refer to the- daughter of Primus Mallows, watchmaker, Clerkenwell, Red Lion street, Three Dials." "Don't perplex me with too many details. My head is frightfully weak. Give me time to collect my thoughts." Leechcraft paused, and pretended to re- flect. - "As .1 wake up my sleepy memory, I do reeall that two maidens were brought hither in the early part of the night. Who knows, but one of these is, the veritable she that you seem anxious about?" '"Unsympathizing and obstinate being! You know more than this. I see it in your malign eyes. Who brought the maidens to the Tower?" ". My Lord Hungerford Crofton, JefTreys brought them here. You know Jeffreys. Everybody knows Jeffreys. He is an amiable creature! If you want proof that he is amia- ble, go and see him on the bench, at the Old' Bailev." "; The wretch!" exclaimed he who has thus far been known by the appellation of Dyce Hungerford, the watchmaker's apprentce. "This infamous proceeding shall be made known to the king!" -Leeoheraft began to rumble down in his stomach, and kept on rumbling till he seemed on the. point of losing his strength and falling upon the flags. This strange conduct greatly !ecensed Hungerford. "What demon has entered your lean body now? Dare you- sport with my feelings, knave? Yes, the king shall be informed of the outrage." Leecheraft laughed more mockingly than before. "Cease, or I'll pin you to the wall 1" vocif- orated Hungerford, hot with rage.  I' The king shall know it. He I he! Ho-! hol The king will right you. He!l he! ool }ho ",  Rtaven I raven.!" muttered the young man, then cooled himself by walking to and fro in one of the passages. '"Sir George Jeffreys," he said, presentl, "is a beast of prey. For this act, he s8al rcount to me. Dearly, dearly shall he pay &fr the distardly deed. To think: of her in the power of such a miscreant ' The thought drives me to the verge of madness I Where is he? Lead me to him, and I will give you Roh a gift as headsman never had." ":I. will not lead you to him," answered Leechoraft, suddenly becoming alm again.   "Here, herel Take this. I will double the sum toI-morrow.:"  He proffered a heavy purse to Leeoheraft, who refused it with a sneer., "Bribe those with gold who lust for' it. I live by my trade. Ha I ha!t By my trade! Whatis gold to me?-to me who cannot go out into the world to spend it? To me," he shrieked, " on whose head rests the curse of, the world I I belong to the Tower, and the Tower to me. I shall eat and I shall drink while kings love to reign, ambition seeks honor, and the passions of men hurry them to destruction! I shall eat and drink while I live; and, cut off from the pulse of humanity, what more can I wish? Away with dross  Bring me the block and the axe. Ha! ha! hat" -The peal of laughter with which he finished this outhurst was discord itself. Hungerford contemplated him with a species of awe. - "My poor fellow," he said, presently, in a soothing voice, " you feel the curse of your trade." "No more, no more, my lord! I want no puling pity. - Compassion cannot liftrme to a level with my fellow-worms. I am in my tomb; I walk about in it; I eat and sleep in it; I can only leave it by stealth in- the hours of darkness, and then at the risk of being torn in pieces. But I tell you, the guilt is not mine ; the guilt is his who bids me strike. There-there-there! That subject is done. It is you who demand attention, not me. I am ready for you. You are young, and have, as yet, no curse on you. Be silent a mo- ment." The headsman drew forth a mwd handker- chief, and wiped some cold drops from his cheeks and brow, breathed hard a few seconds, then added: "I remember where we left off. My Lord Hungerford Crofton, do you love the daughter of Primus Mallows?" As well as man may love maiden!" "It's a pity. It's to be regretted, for- you may get a wound by it that will never heal." "Jeffreys shall die! I swear it 1'" "Yes, he'll die; so will you; so will I. Perhaps he did not act on his own responsi- bility. Did that occur to you?"   Leech- craft fastened his glittering eyes on Hunger- ford. "I did not." "Is Jeffreys the only bad man at court?" "Certainly not." ' There is Arlington, Monmouth, and the king." "True, true But Jeffreys, being in high fiavor with Charles, would not pander to Ar. lingion or Monmouth." "Yet Juffrys. would go on his kneeS to do the bidding of the king."   "To what does all this tend?" asked Hun- gerford, uneasily. "To this!" cried Leechcraft. "' It was by the king's orders that the two maidens were abducted and brought to the Tower of London. You'll go to Charles of England for redress, will you? Ha! ha! ha!" The headsman's eyes outglittered the rays of his torch. Hungerford stood mute with grief and amazement. "Has-has the king--has the king seen her since she was brought to the Tower?" He asked this with a most painful effort. "He has," Leecheraft replied, coldly. Hungerford groaned, and pressed his hands upon his brows. "Your apprenticeship is ended," the heads- man resumed. "Little good, you see, comes of this romantic passion. It is in vain that you have humbled yourself to the level of Primus Mallows. It is without reward that you have worn the disguise-of a watchmaker's appren- tice." "In vain, indeed,!" gasped the young man. "You are not the only one who has been masquerading. I have learned, from the dwarf, Grub, that you saw two cavaliers at Lin- coln's Inn Fields." "I did -I did! One of them I disarmed." "Recall their faces and persons, my lord." "It was in the dusk of evening, and I was too much excited to note them closely, I remember that the man whom I attacked was called Orloff by his companion. The latter, I now recollect, was of a sallow complexion, and had a sear on his face," replied Hunger- ford, thoughtfully. "' He of the scar was the king," said Leech- craft. "a The king!" repeated Crofton, quite over- powered with surprise. "But stay I The king has no scar, upon his face." "My lord, are your wits so poor? That scar was inflicted with paint, and the sallow- ness came from the same cause." "As I recall his voice and bearing, my doubts vanish. His companion was the Earl of Arlington. Alas for Margaret Gurther!"I "Do not despair, my lord. The maidens were not separated, and Lady Castlemaine i was a concealed party to the king's interview' with them, having previously revealed to the c trembling fair ones the secret of his royalty. a Her jealousy was excited. No harm came of i that nocturnal visit. Lady Castlemaine, con- vinced of their innocence, touched by their I appeals, and stimulated by her own burning r jealousy, planned their escape from the Tow er, but, unfortunately, confided its execution ] to George Jeffreys, who falsely and malicious- ly betrayed. the trust." "Where are they now?, Every moment' you give me a new hope and a new terror." .   "One is in the Tower: of the other, I have no knowledge." "In Heaven's name, which? Why do you torture me?" "Patience, my lord. . Al in good time. Let us ae walking. You are shivering in these unhealthy damps. Come; I will show you your guide hither. I will show you Ajax. Ajax, of the Woman's Head-pander to any one who will employ him." "Wretch!" muttered Hungerford. The headsman moved forward so fast through the passages, that the young noble- man had difficulty in keeping pace with him. He would have asked a score of questions, -but the tall and meagre phantom would not pause to listen. They came to a place where the damps were more deadly, and water dripped from the walls. The floor, was coated with slime, and his feet slipped on the flags. "Tread carefully. We are approaching the pitfalls. 'Give me your hand,"  "No, no!" said Hungerford, shivering at the touch  is cold fingers. "My footing is firm." "Advance a little. . Look down." Leecheraft went on his knees, and thrust his link into a dark hole that looked like ,a well. ; '"What is this?" asked Crofton, gazing into the black abyss. "The rat-pit," replied the headsman. A moaning sound came up from the depths. "What is that?" demanded Hungerford, ia a startled tone. "Ajax, your guide. Ajax, the lover of heads. Ajax, the crawling, fawning, lying, pimping knave." "How came he here?" "I cast him in, as I sometimes cast heads into a basket," said Leechraft, moodily. "By whose orders?" "By the orders of one whose commands I am accustomed to obey; the Duke of Mon- mouth." '"The Duke of Monmouth!" echoed Qrof- ton. '"Then 1;e has been in these vaults to- night?" "Help, help I Mercy, mercy!' cried a voice from the pit. "Let him howl himself hoarse," said Leech- craft. "The water will flow into the drains anon, and force upon him a myriad of fam- ishing rats. They'll devour him in an hour." "Iron-hearted man! This must not be; he must be saved from such a fate. Fetch ropes-a ladder--lose no time!" "Are you so soft-hearted?" sneered the headsman. "Can you not suffer an enemy to perish? It was this crippled creaturetwho betrayed the maidens to the king. The gir,] Craw Kibbie, was his instrument. He .onf fessed it to me as I dragged him along.

By this time Bransom had risen to his feet, and a most unpresentable 'o bject he was. Manifestly, his mind was unsettled. He talk- ed disconnectedly of Craw Kibbie, Ruby Mal- lows, the 'Woman's Head, the Tower, and a dozen other things that had gotten inextrica- bly mixed'.up in 'his memory. "Now," said Crofton, " to the king. But, first, whatshall we do with this fellow?" "Let hiim go out as he came in. He has a key. Brother, brother, do you know where ,you are?"

On *e afternoon of the day folloWing the events of the last chapter, two persons ralk- ed slowly to and fro in one -of the wide halla ofe itower. One was the White Toer. One as the kig, the 'other the Earl of Arlington. The brow of tharles Stuart was somiewhat clouded with An- ger. "I eannot comprehend it, sire;" said 'the earl, in answer to a remark of his majesty. "They bould not fly from the windows like   birds, nor through the roof like witches. -Their escape must have been aided by per- sons in authority in the Tower. My wishes shall not be mocked in this -manner. - I will speedily learn who has dared to come between me and my pleasures," said the king, frown- ing. "After so much trouble, sire, this is vexa- tious," returned Arlington. ," It is a most mortifying termination to the romantic knight errantry of Dare Cutlock and Orloff Shilling- law. The damsels were fair, and our plots to bring them hither most ingenious. When the presumptuous meddler shall be found, I trust he will feel the weight of the royal dis- pleasure." Just then Grub was discovered, sitting in the embrasure of a window. "Here is your monster, sire," added the earl. "Why do you chuekle and leer, you ape?" "I chuckle and leer because I know things that kings and earls don't. The six-footers know a great deal sometimes, but I can show you a three-footer that knows mo,re," replied the dwarf, raising himself by his arms and swinging after his old fashion. "What do you know, you atom?", said Ar- lington. "If your knowledge is worth any- thing, it shall be paid for." ' Let the king speak," returned Grub. "There is more music in a king's voice than in a dozen earls.: Sire, speak to -your own Grub, brave Grub, faithful Grub, cunning Grub." "There's -something in that overgrown head, I think," said the king. "Have you anything to say, sirrah " [ "There's something that you:want to know," returned Grub, shrewdly. "True, my elf; read me the riddle at once. You that know so much, should fathom my wishes without asking." Gruab leaped from his perch. Calling a link-boy, he said: "Brother Charles, follow me." "This is too much, varlet!" slid Arling. ton. "Abuse not the goodness of your royal master." "I abuse it not. He is king of the six. footers, and I am' king of the three-footers ; that makes us brothers. I am a king, and he is a king; and merry monarchs we are. There'll be more kings one of these days. There's nmy uncle, 'the Duke of York, tand there's my nephew. the Dhke of Monmouth." "What means this chatterbox?" asked the king. ' You can judge as well as fnyself, sire. Beme erazy thought has entered his bloated head." K' Iings are mortal," quoth Grub. - The throne is never without an heir. Who-is the   rightful heir to the royal seat when Charles of England expires? Askthepeople; ask thee people I Who so tall and handsome as oir royal nephew, Monmouth '? "Enough, enough, presumpttuous dwarf]" said-the king, hastily. 4 Be not so free with thy tongue in the hearin of York. He Would not mind casting thee into the rathit foir words less 'ignifieant. Lead on, and teaoh thy wayward fancies to be mute." "My fancies Sometimes run nearer the t*fth than you wot of. This way, sire. Our path is downward; we visit the vaults." "To what end?" demanded Arlington. "Nay, question not, my lord. He 'hi* something to show us, I'll warrant," said the king.  Gibbering and chuckling, Grub plungsed down a long flight of steps, and soon involvea the parties in a labyrinth of passages. More than once Arlington besought the king to go no farther; but he resolutely persisted, and finally, chilled and shivering, stood between two dismal lines of dungeon doors. Motion- ing the king and the earl to be silent, he un- locked one of these doors, when instantly a wild and naked figure csme forth. "In the name of Our Lady!" exclaimed Charles, unsheathing his sword. "What wretched creature is this " "It's an ape, an ape!" screamed Grub. "e 'Fore God, these should be the features of Jeffreys!" exclaimed the earl. Jeffreys, seeing the king and Arlington, cowered back into the cell, and tried to Vent his shame and indignation in words ; but his feelings overpowering him, he emitted only inarticulate sounds, resembling more the howl of a dog than human speech. "What means this?" asked the king, turn- ing sharply to Grub. "* He stole the pretty ones from the Red Chamber," replied the dwarf, his eyes dane- ing with malicious pleasure. !"To Sir George, then, we owe this good turn!" muttered the king, frowning. Jeffreys shook his fist at Grub, who said  "Call me devil, dear; call me devil!" - "It appears," said Arlihgton, " that my L;rd Jefftrys has an eye for beauty. My liege, his conduct is most Miudaitous." "How happens it, Sir George, that we final you in this plight?" asked the king, bhatply Jeffreys had choked, and struggled,:And swelled with rage till he foamed-at the moutith, and seemed ready to fall down in a fit of apo- plexy.    . . Hde Is dying with joy, ire, at hisb sudden deliverance!" interposed Grub. : Ho, M. He can't speak. But I will speak for him. He went sporting in'the king's parki. Ha, hill He. must needs take away with him two pre tt. does, and cage them in the dungeons. But *      he encountered a brave gentleman. There was a drawing of swords, and .the fair ones took, t, flight, - The struggle wrs short; my Lord';Jeffg"s was conquered, stripped, and thrust'inth is cell, where he has howled him- ,self bhars A pretty sight, brother Charles! :See h]ow.:he has scratched off his nails, and ttory his fiesh , and made himself frightful. ,P4l,qbug; call mebeetle; call me devil " ',.'!Sir, sire," gasped Jeffreys, his frame qdvermng with excitment, " a--a-a conspir- -:  .' No doubt!" said the king, coldly. T"The-the-the throne is-is in danger! ,': In the event of your majesty's sudden death, the Duke"--Jeffreys paused to recover his voice and get strength to go on--" the 'Duke of York will be cheated of the succession. I have full proof and the names of the conspir- ators." He stopped again for want of breath. d"The paper," he added, in a screeching voice, "should be somewhere hereabouts." "A miserable subterfuge.!'" sneered the king. "I'll hear no more of it. Sir George, you have been honored with my confidence,; it is yours no longer. For last-night's serv- ice I will find some fitting reward. Your toilet, my lord, could be, improved. When next you betray the friendship of Charles Stuart, may you meet your deserts as prompt- ly and summarily. Grub, lead us from these miserable dens." Ho! ho!" mumbled Grub. "Ho! ho! What knaves are these, six-footers! They be- tray each other. The king. betrays his sub- jects, they betray their king. Follow, broth- er. Come on through the damps and the darks. "Above and below I come and I go;     . And none shall knowr How I come and I go."* . The king and Arlington walked away from the dungeons, .leaving Jeffreys standing speechless and astounded. "Let him howl! ,let him howl!": chuckled the dwarf. , It'll do :him good to howl. Let him howl as he howls At the Old Bailey." Charles Stuart. traversed the subterranean aisles in silence, and reached the balls. of the White Tower with a mood y and thoughtful brow., He was moving slowlyr on, when a young man, richly attired, suddenly -issued from a recese, and dropping upon one knee before the, monarch, exclaimed: , "A boon, sire, aboon!" "What! How is this? My Lord Crofton! Where are our guards? How gained you ac- cess, sir? What is your wishes?" "To appeal to the noble heart of my sov- ereign," answered Hungerford. "To throw myself upon his magnanimity." "sArise, my lord. Seek your sovereign at Q   the audience-chamber. He is not in a gra- cious temper to-day," replied the king. "Nay, sire,.,you do yourself injustice. Your royal heart can never be dead to the appeals of your subjects. I come to ask hap- piness at your hands." Charles Stuart bit his lips and was. con- fused. "There's a maiden, sire, that I love, and who loves me." "The old story!" murmured the king. "I am always expected to be better than I am. Ak monarch, forsooth, must be generous, whether he will or no.. You insinuating and fair-spoken gentlemen will coax away our crown yet. Crofton, your sovereign confesses to some. shame in this matter, but will en- deavor to act more worthily in future. I have evil counselors, my friend?'-he looked at Ar- lington archlly-" wicked fellows, who haunt me night and day. If I knew where to find the maiden, I would gladly restore her to you, with a dower befitting the station to which you design to raise her. Up, my lord, up! Bend not the knee to one who has done you more wrong than he is willing to own." "Sire, you . give. me new life!" replied Hungerford, kissing the king's hand and ris- ing. "Be not too sanguine, my lord.  Miss Mallows and her cousin have strangely dis- appeared from the Tower." "My liege, I am assured of their safety. Miss Mallows is now under the protection of Mrs. Haselrigge, in the White Tower. I need but-your royal permission to restore her to her friends." "You have it, my lord, but she goes hence a dowered bride. I myself will attend the nuptials and give away the bride. Not a word, my lord, not a word!" "' And what of the other maiden?" asked Arlington, hesitatingly.  "Ask Grub, Grub;, Grub!" cried the dwarf. "She had a ride on Diabolus. What a ride it was! You'll find Meg at the Barley Mow with'Christy Kirk." "( Sire," said Arlington, "allow me to imi- tate your nobleness and liberality. My banker shall pass a thousand pounds to the credit of this same Margaret Gurther, which she shall receive on her wedding-day." "Their virtue, their modesty and beauty, render them worthy of our benefactions. Now, Crofton, go, away without shaming us by your gratitude for, in good faith, you de- serve this reparation at our hands. When I gave secret orders to have ihe..watchmaker's apprentice inveigled tait an er..and cast into a dungeon, I knew n* f tt Aimnj ustice was falling upon the head oij'.!d Huu- gerford Crofton."  - !"If you erred like a man, you have atoned   like a king," answered Crofton, glowing with joy. At that instaut the Duke of Monmouth and Lady Castlemaine approached. "My liege," said Lady Castlemaine, "the picture of your majesty, of which I was rob- bed at Hounslow, has- been mysteriously re- stored." "A most singular circumstance ; but I can offset it by another as strange. My signet- ring, taken from me at the Barley Mow, I found, this morning, on my dressing-table," answered the. king. "It seems that this high- wayman is ubiquitous. Neither locks, nor bars, nor guards can keep him from where he wishes to go. The matter must be looked into."  "I am informed, sire, that a man in a white and black mask was shot last night, at Houns- low, while, committing a robbery," said Lady Castlemaine. "I have credible information," said Arling- ton, " that four distinct robberies were com- vnitted at four different places, last night, at about the same hour." "Every knave in the country will take to the road in a blick and white mask," said Monmouth, smiling. "I am half inclined to believe," resumed the king, musingly, "that some one oear c r person, and having access to us at attins, has connived at these unaccountable robll- ies. I perceive that we shall have nothing but flying highwaymen, and masked knights, and cutpurses. Monmouth, see if you cannot put a stop to this business. I give you carte blanche to lave at these scoundrels, and work' your own sweet will on them."   .  ' You handsome villain!" whispered Lady Castlemaine to Monmouth. "What if your royal father should find out your doings?"  "I will persuade you to intercede for me,"- answered the duke, in the same tone. "I never would do it! You robbed me, wild boy; but it was done sweetly, I grant. This way, your grace, out of earshot." "Whisper not to that graceless boy!" said Charles, playfully. "I know not what 'rou may talk of." "But two or three words with him, my liege, after which I will return him as good as I found him; which is not promising much.'" She took the duke's arm and led him to one  of the windows which looked out upon the moat.  "Son of Lucy Walters and Charles Stuart, no more of your mad pranks, in Heaven's name! No more larking and plotting. No more cabals against your uncle of York. You and Leechcraft have come near being, acquainted this night. Monmouth, beware of the axe I I have a terrible presentiment   that you will die a violent and bloody death. Do not abuse the clemency of your royal father, Sever the dangerous bonds between you andRobert Ferguson. The connection is fraught with danger. He is drawing you rapid- ly toward destruction. Cut loose from those instruments that he has called around you. Spurn from you the vermin of St. Gties. Send your three horses out of the country, lest their color and singular beauty hould chance to betray you." "So so, ,my lady! You know all. What varlet has dared give you these starling de- tails?" demanded Monmouth, pale and em- barrassed.  "No matter. The knowledge came to me without falsehood to you. I know everything in connection with your plot. You have been, in some measure, the dupe of Ferguson, who has levied sums of money, under the eo\er of the White and Black, that you little knoioRf. Drop forever your mask, which has caused so much consternation, in city and country. Throw away your false nose and brows, and commit to the flames your sujt of green. Do this, or I will inform your ronal father, be the consequences what they may." Monmouth was silent a moment. He took Lady Castlemaine's hand presently, and kiss- ed it. "Fair lady," he said, in a voice touched with emotion, "I obey your wishes. Night- shade, of the White and Black, shall be seen no more. I will also correct the abuses that have sprung up so abundantly from my reck- less and thoughtless example. But my horses, nadam, I cannot so easily part with. Let me beg of you to accept the white steed, Diabo- lus-like yourself, an incomparable creature. The dwarf, Grub, shall teach you to manage it." "I accept your promise and your gift most gratefully. Count upon me always as your friend ' Should Ferguson again lead you into the vortex of treason, and that handsome head of yours be in danger, advise me of your peril, and it shall be a hard thing if I do not save you." "Thanks, lady! I know you are allpow- erful with the king. With Heaven's aid, I will reform. There shall be no more larks on the highway, at least. But, lady, must not one follow his destiny? Can one resist the pressure of fate? I feel that this Fergu- son is my evil demon, yet cannot shake him off." "I will help your grace. Be of good cheer. See'! your sovereign father is watching us. He is a good king, a sweet king. Look well to your head, Monmouth!" Monmouth folded his arms and sighed. His handsome face was softened with melan- choly.   "Stay a moment, my lady! I have done some good actions. The kmg and the earl go masquerading, sometimes." "Dare Cutlock and Orloff Shillinglaw!'" she murmured, with a slight frown. "I un- derstand." "I came near marring their purpose of bringing those pretty ones to the Tower; and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I as- sisted both to escape, while at the same time I recovered important papers, and punished that yelling cur, Jeffreys. There'll be a feud between us; but luckily I am the stronger of the two. I fear him not." "All is safe. We are friends. Let us join the king. My Lord Crofton will have a fair wife and a virtuous. Monmouth, you must dance with me at the wedding." "Right merrily," responded the duke, as they walked slowly back to the king, who e      P"   was patiently waiting their coming. He eyed Monmouth sharply, struck, no doubt, by the seriousness of his expression. 'Sire,' said Lady Castlem:ine, ," you have this day exercised the richest prerogative of power, which is, to confer happiness." Crofton placed his hand on his heart, and bowing low, said:  "My liege, both my heart and my sword are yours." "Arlington," said Charles, presently, "1 feel more like a king than I did an hour ago." "And I, sire, feel more like a man," re sponded the earl. "My royal father," said Monmouth, in an impressive voice, "I accept the commission with which you charge me. Be assured that Nightshade, of the White and Black, shall be heard of no more!" [TH END.]
