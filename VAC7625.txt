vRn SITUATION--THE LOYAL PICETB--TRN nonas.
MAN.
Washington wasa niil iary camp, and its usu-
ally quiet streets eci. to the measured tread
of armed men.     The. tai'-spangled .banner
waved tranquilly over perturbed anefluctuat
ng Baltimore, and Federal cannon bristled on
Arlington and Georgetown Heights.   A long
line of loyal bayonets gleamed brightly on the
troubled borders of Virginia.  cCleilan and
Patterson were advancing; the impatient col-
umus of McDowell faced Fairfar and Manassas
on the extreme left, Fortress Monroe frowned
grimly on the defiant approaches of mad rebel-
lion ; while the blockading squadron swarmed
the Gulf.
The disloyal States were beginning to feel the.
power of the Government, the strength of the
Union, the wrath of the North, and the glowing
patriotism of the awakened West.
The uprising of a free, brave, and industrious
people is a grand, yet terrible spectacle.
others wept over their gallant sons, and sent
them to, the glorious .field. Sweethearts and
wives kissed lovers and husbands, and hurried
them to the great battle for freedom Gray.
headed sires girded, the sword to their stalwart
boys, and blessing them  with uplifted, trem-
bling hands and husky voices, reminded them
of W%.-iington ; that wounds in front are the
glory of the soldier ; that to die for ones coun-
tr is t I join the world's army of comnnemorat-
heroes and martyrs. . . -
Never was sucha sight seensince the Revo-
lation. Party lines, were' forgotten; partisan
- differences died thedeath, and the discordant
tongue of demagogue-clamor was heard no more.
There was political peace in- the North and in
the West. The spirit of unaggimitf possessed all
hearts. A .new crusade waS inaugurated. Fair
women, stirred with a nobler enthusiasm than

eret inspired the daughters of the conquering
pilgrim  Cross, prepared laurels for their soi-
dier-heroes, and cheered their hurried, eager
march to Meet the isulting foe. The coldest
blood grew warm; the inost stagnant currents
began to flow, and all thought as from  one
mighty brain. If here and there Treason dared
to mutter, 'low 'down'in' its throat, the quick ver-
diet of the People sent it, silentand shamed, to
its own, laee.
There was no conscription. Neither threats,
nor wheedling, nor bribery, were resorted to, to
fill the 'ranks of the Union hosts. The Govern-
ment was amazed An'd cmba-rassed by the
swarming multitudes that hurried to the nation-
al standard at the fidt blast of the'bugle. The
despotisms of the Old World, that had, at the
beginning, laughed at our calamity and mocked
when our trial carme, wondered beyond measure
at the spectacle of a mighty army, gathered in
a day, ba 'power inherent in itself, stimulated
neither by hope of pillage nor love of conflict,
but by pure patriotism.
This geat 'Army of the North and West rest*
ed quietly on the Potomac, awaiting calmly the
shock of battle. General Scott, strong in his
integrity, faithful to the Union.and 'his soldier-
instincts, ian consonanc with his carefully-
studied plan of the campaign, was now drawing
his strong cordons more closely. around the
black hearti f Rebellion.
The rebeis'affteted to behold these vast prep
rations with 'ontempt.   Intrenched behind
masked batteries, they raised and strtik the
*ar-post, boAsti of their achievements in tlh
past, And' vain -gloriuisly breathiog speedy de
feat to the barbarian Yankee hordes. But noth-
ing came of the semenaces; and Washington, in-
stead of becoming a "stone quarry," as threat-
ened by the potential leader of'the Couf derate
forces, wa unusually gay an  attractive. In

roism. Indeed, their legs were their best arms,
the former taking them from that danger which
the latter could not, or would not,. manfully
meet.
The rebels occupied Fairfax and Manassas,
and an advance upon those places was talked
of by those in authority, greatly to the satisfac-
tion of the loyal troops. The retreat of the en-
emy had been so uniform that many dreamed
of an easy victory ; but there were cooler per-
sons who shook their heads, and talked of Gates
flying before the charging squadrons of Corn-
wallis at the disastrous field of Camden.
Weary of inaction and iheited by an earnest
but over-zealous press, the Army of the Poto-'
mac was impatient for a decisive forward move-
ment. Such was the situa ion of affairs at the
time our story commences.
Late on a soft and pleasant summer-night,
some weeks after the magnificent moonlight-
march over the Long Bridge, and the occupa-
tion of Alexandrianby the dashing Fire Brigade,
s man, mounted on a powerful horse, was ob-
served by two of the loyal pickets slowly ad-
vancing in the direction of Fairfax, unconscious,
apparently,'that he w4 ear those whose duty
it was to demand his business and dispute his
right to proceed, unless duly vouched for by a
military pass. The pickets, on making this
discovery, drew closer to each other, andscreen-
ed by a cluster of intervening bushes, quietly
awaited the horseman's coming. When he was
sufficiently near for that purpose, one of the
men stepped from his covert,.and demanded :
" Who goes ?"                       ,
The horseman, instead of answering this chal-
lenge in customary form, instantly spurred his
horse and made a bold attempt to run the pick-
et.  So sudden was this movement, that the
guard had neither time to cock nor present his.
musket; and had it not been for his .compan-
ion, the determined rider would have effected
his purpose.  The former, as the latter was
passing near his concealment, and, indeed, al-
most upon him, had the presence of mind to
throw himself forward b-efore the plunging
horse, anil seize it by the bridle, with a force
and energy that effectually checked the animal,
which, however, made a spirited effort to shake
him off.
The man making this decisive demonstration
was tall and athletic, and clad in a plain suit of
national blue. While his right hand grasped
firmly i1he tightened reins, he held in his left a
rifled "musket, surmounted by that terrible
weapon, the sabre-bayonet, which, in the soft
moonlight, glittered like burnished silver. A
heavy dragoon-sword wns girt to his side by a
substantial leathern belt, which also gave sup-
port to a bowie-knife and a brace of revolvers..
His stronglv-defined and sun-browned face
was singular calm and unruffled in expres-
sion, as he nervously pressed the horse back-

ward upon his haunches, and controlled his fier'
spirit.
"Don't hurrystranger,.don't hurry  ,You'll
sweat your. lhoss, if, you :ain't keerful. There's
time enough for any honest business, without
heatin' your blood."
The horseman had reached down to the saddle,
and half-drawn a pistol; but, on hearing this
salutation, let it fall slowly back into the bolster.
"My haste is urgent. Do not detain me- I
should even now be several miles from here,"
he answered, looking umiessily about him.
" Nu doubt o 't; bet them   severial miles
ought todbe torard Arlington, 'stead o' this way.
I'd  ave vou comperhend, impatient stranger,
that nowlbat done up in the shape of flesh, be it
the flesh of men, women, children, or animals,
can budge this way without. the countersign or
a written parse. I'll take one or t'other of 'onm
about this time of the lone starry hours ; which
means, young traveler, about as quick as you
can cleverly git at 'enm."
The horseman glanced downward at the fea-
tures of his interrogator ; they were quiet but
determined.
"I thought," he said, searching his pockets,
" that I passed the loyal pickets half a mile
back; but it would seem that I am mistaken. I
had a paper," he added, hesitatingly, "from one
in authority ; but--but I fear I have lost it."
" Sorry to hear it, sir ! - Am  afeard it'll put
you to a deal o' trouble., You'll obleege nie by
gittin' off o' this hoss. It's a slashing' fine un,
and '11 do for the Boys to prac-tise the calvary
movements on."
4 You surely don't mean to detain and rob
me !" cried the horseman, in evident alarm. "I
warn you that any violence offered to me will be
resisted. Who are you? Call the corporal of
the guard !"
The man laid his hand again upon a pistol.
" To confiscate the. spiles of an inemy, is no
robbery. Your resistance I keer nowbat about,
inasmuch as fighting' is at present my perfession.
As for the next question consarning who I be,
my name is Scotto, independent enp'n of an in-
dependent company of star-spangled critters. I
go for the Union, the whole Union, and constitu-
tional liberty. If I don't eat my bigness into
rebellion, if I don't cut and back, hash, slash,
and gash, right and left, it 'll be because my
hand forgets its cunnin', and my arm loses its
strength, my heart its patriotism, and my brain
its sense ! That's who I be, and that's the ground
on which I stan' on, and, with God's help, will
stan' on while I stan' anywhere on the nirth.
As for the cor'pril of the guard, I'll send for him
when I need him. Havin' answered all your
questions, I'll take the liberty to help you out
of the saddle."
Captain Scotto dropped his musket upori the
grass at his feet, and was about to drag the
young man from his seat, when, making a virtue

I

of necessity, he saved him that trouble by dis-
mounting, but not till he had looked at the
other guard, and perceived 'his weapon leveled
at his head.
" Everything you have asked has been replied
to by me. It Is now my turn to be inquisitive.
What name did you say ?" added Scotto.
" In times like these, names are of little con-
sequence," responded  the. person interrogated.
" however, I have no objections to telling you-
a na ne that has never been disgraced by me.
I a:n called R tphi Girdwood."
"A good nam - and a good bigger by natur',"
returned Scotto, appreciatively. .' But names
an.l figgers don't pars pickets without the docky-
neeits. We've suffered enough by being too
easy with our inemies. Our Gov'ment has hard
work to b lieve that we're in ait actooal state o'
,war with then as will show no marcy. Mistaken
kin Ibess has got to stop somewhere ; and as true
is m' na:ua is Scotto, it shall go hard with the
spy thiat fills mt , my hands."
"Spy!" exclaimedl Girdwood, quickly.
"Spy I said, and spy it is I" said Scotto,
sharply. " Down on t ie grass, mister! Barney
Malone "-he turned to. the guard who stood
near him -" off with this chip's boots, and see
whit's into 'em."%
"Jist as your honor plates! If 'twas a leg or
an ara that ye'd have pulled off, I'd pull it off
all th same; for obajence to orders is the fust
'ty of h bold soger boy," responded. Barney,
a l;'ancing upon Girdwood, with alacrity.
" I protest against this!" exclaimed Girdwood,
retreatimg  behind his horse, which Captain
Scotto still held. "I warn you not to come
lieirer. If I am to be detained, take me to
las i-quarters."
Ie drew up his person and showed Barneyi
donse a figure straight, athletic, and hand-
CliC and too formidable to be lightly approach-
I.
"Is it to Barney Malone ye say it?  Is it to
thrue Uion soldier that ye're sp'akin' ?" re-
rted Barney, throwing himself into an attitude
' defence. " Mind these two illigant bunches
'bones, now !" (Barney held up his fists like
prize-fighter.) "Down on the grass, as ye're
owid, ye murtherin' blackguard !, If 'twasn't
or the likes of ye, we might ivery mother's son
f us be home, dhr'amin' peaceably in our bussed
eds."
"Back!" admonished Girdwood. "Back!"
: Barney not heeding this warning, but con-
inning to press upon the young man, the latter
truck straight out from the shoulder and
nocked him down ; then, with singular celerity
f motion, sprang upon his horse, plunged his
purs mio his sides, and riding over Scotto,
t'le good his escape.
'hye captain seized his musket and fired after
he daring horseman. The report was followed
quick succession by several others along the

I,.

line, but Ralph Girdwood rode on, apparently
unharmed.
CHAPTER II.
TE INDEPENDENT RANGERS AND THE DASKETEEU.
Scott, gazed after Ralph Girdwood til both
horse and rider had dwindled into a iure egeek
in the distance.
" There lie goes, driving' full speed into the
inemy's picket V he muttered, in a i one that suf-
ficiently evidenced his dissatisfaction. - Tisn't
often 1 git fooled in that way. Lubin' what few
fakilties I had, I guess. The twins could done
better'n that. \ ll, it's been the way from the
begiain'; the seceshers, spies, lirates, and
Uion-killers have escaped their desarta. Them
as should a been hung, by the head; or shut by
a squad o' men at thirteen paces, shirk the
awards o' justice in one way or another ; ey; her
by the tender mareies of the Gov'nieit, their
wit, or their heels. I wonder which this ting 'l11
stop? I wonder when the wise uns at Washia'-
ton. 'll begin to work in airnest :: I wonder
when the dull eyes '11 be opened, the heavy ears
begin to hear, and the inactive han-is put forth
their strength. For one, I want to fight! For
one, I want to 'eat my bigness into this rebel-
lion! For one, I want to draw the sword o'
Liberty, and hack, hash, and gash for th.. Con-
tinental Constitution, which is the hope o' thie'
world, and which we've lived under happy and
contented' till this rotten secesher idee was
dinned into the ears of the South-downers-by a
few lazy, pervaricatin', pervarted dimagogues,
grasping' arter rule and authority. That's the
short, long, and whole on't 1"
Scotto looked thoughtfully at the bright sa-
bre-bayonet on his musket, sighed, and turned
slowly to Barney Malone
"Up, Barney, up! Never fall down, man,
when a traitor strikes."
"-Niver fall;is it? cried Barney, springing
to his feet. ' ";Kape0'ur trotters when you're
knocked down, you mane ? Stan' up when you're
sprawlin', wud ye ?  Cap'n, jewel, they it your-
self, and jest be afther informin' ine how it
agrays wid fe, immejiate aftherwards. His fist
flew outLlike a stame-hammier straight into me
countenance when all to onet, without any warn-
in', something' drapped at me feet; an) meself
was it that drapped. Bad cess to the murdering'
seeader! He's spied the sittin' of na illigant an
eye as iver sighted a gun-barrel, or winked at
an angel. May gunpowther and lead bring me
to grafe if I don't remimber this'insult when we
reach Melasees Gap; Feerfax.Coort-House, and
other ribil intrenehments. The Sixty-ninth is
the boys for 'em! The Sixty-ninth is the eye-
wathier for me!I"
Barney resumed his musket, and seemed lost
in a sudden reverie of the Sixty-ninth.
Will they fight?", asked Scotto, look'mg
again at the lessening form of the horseman.

" Is it of Paddy Malone ye axes it?  Is it me-
self that ye're s. aiun' to? Isn't it some dirthy
drame you're in, cap'n dear? Will cats ketcnh
mice?   Will lislies swim the say?  Will fer-
rets run afther rats? Go away wid ye, Cap'n
eotto !"
Barney made a playful thrust at Scotto with
his bayonet; but it was evident that the ques-
tion hind touched him in a sensitive spot.
"I'mi sorry,''said Scotto, with a troubled face,
" that the chap got away. I thought you could
manage him, Barneyy, or I should laid hands on
him inyself. I shouldn't wonder now, if there
was plans of our works in his boots. He wouldn't
slipped through the fingers of one o' then Fire
Zarves in that way, I'll warrant."
"It's, the rid-capped divils you're comparin'
me wid ! I'll tell ye jest the truth, eap'n ; the
fire eraythers are good for contindin' with fire
and rather, but wud go down afore a stame-
hammer as suddint as Barney Malone of the
Sixty-ninth. Take part of the blame to your-
self. )idn't a fine horse flout ye at the same
time? Why didn't ye liould him, cap'n ? Tell
me that que tion, I axes ye " S     w
Barney leered cunningly at Scotto, who was
now very willing to drop the subject, and, for-
tunately for him, the appearance of a body of
horsemen favored his wishes.
"Here comes my star-spangled     critters !
You'll hear from them, Barney, afore this on-
nat'ral war is over. There isn't one on 'em but
is able to eat his bigness into rebellion. They're
true men, gathered from all parts of the North
and West. They've seen all sorts o' sarvice,
and love the Union as they do their mothers.
They're boys arter myown heart! For liberty
and the nation, they'll hack, and out, and slice,
with the bravest fighters in the land. Not that
they nat'rally love blood and slaughter. Not
that, by no means whatsomever. In civil life
they're as tender-hearted ahp women, and indus-
trious as ants. But the sperrit of Seventy-Six is
irnto 'em! The patriotism of the fightin' fathers
swells in their bosoms like new wine in bottles.
No plunder, no filthy-lucre, no pay for the In-
dependent Union Rangers. They're in nobody's
sarvice but the country's ; under nobody's com-
mand in particular brit mine ; in for no time, but
for the war, long or short. We ask nothin' of
Government but the priver'lege of begin' put' face
to face with the foe. We want io clothes, no
quipments, no houses, no rations, no money out
, ncle Sam. We can take keer of ourselves,
and do it chebrful, all' for the sake of the glori-
ous old Stars and Stripes that our ancestors
fou ht udder at Bunker Hill, Lexington, Con-
oor , and other places. It's a fine old rag," he
added, casting his eyes upward to the flag that
floated over Iis command. " It's a fine old rag,
and woe, woe to the traitors that betray it !"
Perhaps the patriotic Scotto thought of a
white-headed ol man, once known in America

as 'General Twiggs, but remicmbcred now only
for the.enormity of his treason.
By this time the Union Rangers had drawn
up before their leader. This company of index.
pendent men was-composed of the best material
for hard and efficient service. They numbered
a hundred and ten, including officers, and had
rallied around Scotto because he had seen serv-
ice in Mexico, and in the wild warfare of the
West. They knew that he would not flinch, ant
was the man to lead them to victory, if it were
within human attainment. his hardy frame, well-
seasoned muscles, and, universally-accredited
courage, gave promise of great effectiveness ;
while his unquestioned loyalty and many good
qualities, secured the respect and friendship of
his followers.
: "Lieutenant Scarlett," said Scotto, "have you
seen anybody stirring' within our lines?"
"Only a man on horseback, who might, for
aught 1 know, have been one of our pickets.
Seeing us, he quickened his speed, and we soon
lost sight of him. . He should have reached.the
picket somewhere hereabout," replied the officer
} addressed,
" He did reach it, and run it, too !" returned
Scotto, biting his lip, " He's a good two mile
on his way to Fairfax, by this time."
"A detachment of the-Black Horse Cavalry
has been popping at our pickets a"few miles
above," remarked the lieutenant, looking in-
quisitively at the face of his leader.
" The Black Hoes Calvary 1" repeated Scotto,
quickly. " We must have a dash at them, boys.
Black losses or white losses don't make no dif-
ference in a man's fighting' qualities. The black
hoss idee 'nay scare children, but it won't go
down with our Northers and Westers that are
big enough to buckle on a sword, or sight a rifle.
There's nothin' in color, but everything in
pluck. We'll move out our lads, and make a
reconnoisance ,,torard  the  inemy's advance-
guard."
At that moment a man spurred from the rear
in considerable haste, and, approaching Captain
Scotto, said, with a scandalized look :
" Them twins are fighting' ag'in !"
" Fightin' ag'in ? -rIn course they're fightin'
again. They're callers fightiri' ag'in," returned
Scotto. Then raising his voice, ie shouted
"Peleg ! Pickerin'!- ro the front, you littler. s.
calls !"
After some delay and commotion in the rear
rank, two boys, about a dozen years old, -dress-
ed as Zouaves, mounted on mules, made their
appearance in front. They were somewhat dis-
ordered and blown, evidently from a recent
brush.
"Been at it ag'in-haven't ye ?" queried Scot;r s
without a particle of apparent wrath.
One of. the lads grinned, the other looked sni.
len.
" Clapperelawin' each other, weren't th y

Oo'.'ril Keith ?".turning to the man who had
preferred the charge against the culprits.
" They was ! They was at it, peggin' away at
each other arter the old fashion," replied Cor-.
poral Keith. -
"it's into 'em ! It's nat'rally into 'em, and
has been into'em ever since I found 'em a'hang-
in' in a basket at my door. Prehaps you all,
may or may'nt know," he continued, looking at
his command, " that that was the way that I
oome into the possession of them belligerents.-
Yea, my men, then critters was in a basket,,
done up in some coarse sackin', with never so
much linen on 'em as would kiver a pin-cushion.
Tiey was very new babies. They was too new.
to be balloon' in a basket. I was a single man
then, as I am now, and as I'm like to be through
life ; and knew no more about new babies than
a Thomas-eat about kittens. . I was a good 'cal
exercised in my feelin's. I thought, at fust, that
I'd slip 'em slyly aboard the fust stage-coach
that passed along the rad, and send 'em, sackin'
and all, to seek their fortins otherwheres. But
fafe ordered things different, for jest then they,
begun to claw each other and scream. Their
cries went through my ears like the shriek of a
ie. While- I stood staring , onsartin what to do,.
my housekeeper, an old maid aunt, come out of
a suddint.  When she seed that basket, she
bristle.l up like a porkypine, and looked at me
awful.
What's into it?' sez shea
"'Reg'lar live uns!' sea I, edgin' away. ,
Luke Scotto, you're a depravity !' sez she.
Who'd a thought a respectable house would a
had. babies hung onto it!'
"'Nobody, I guess, that's acquainted here-
abouts.' sez I, maliciously.  With that she toss-
ed her head and went in, leavin' the basket on
the door-step. But she didn't stay long. There
was a woman's heah into her, notwithstanding'
her sharpness. She come back ag'in and told
me to fetch in the basket."
"Were they twins ?" asked   the lieutenant,
smiling.'
The Lord he only knows !  They was about.
thie same length and bigness.  Their featur's
was as onlike as two hIindu idols, and they fou't
each other; tieerfore we thought.it best to call
'em twins ; though I ginerally styles 'em the
Basketeers. Individooally, they're named Peleg
and 'Piekerin'. Like many other brethers-tak-
in' it for granted they're brethers-they don't
agree. There is a tendency -into 'em to pitch in.
There hasn't been a day simee I brung 'em up,
that they haven't pitcher in, more or less, often-
er more.-I reckia they come of a fightin' fam-
ily, and these be the instincts of the second and
third ginerations."
Seotto paused, and various comments were'
ade by the Rangers, some of which were by
*o means flattering to the subjects of this short;
story.z

" There being' so much tight in 'em," re
sumed the captain, "I'm goin' to turn it to sarmo
account. If they'll.tackle the inemy with half
the spirit they do each other, they'll do mis-
chief. There's been a good 'cal of our'ousty

The two now continued their way, in nearly
unbroken silence. Putting their horses to a
gallop, they passed Centreville. Girdwood had
yet seen nothing i o inpre-s him with the
strength of the Confederates, whose 'cause he,
seemed ready to espouse. Indeed, he had ob-
served little else than a few feeble, and, obvious-
ly, hastily-constructed intrenehments, mounted
by three or four six-pound howitzers. Centre-
ville was in no state of defence. There were
men there in considerable force, but without the
means of making an efficient stand. Ralph
could not forbear expressing astonishment.
A grim smile--the first he had seen upon his,
sonibre visage-appeared a moment upon ilur-
dlestone's lips.
" We have no daily press to betray us," he
said, quickly, and with an .energetic gesture.
" General Beauregard ties up the tongues of
fools and the necks of knaves. But blabbing
folly reigns supreme and rampant in the camp
of our enemies.  We know when they buy
a battery, and where they place it. We know
when they contemplate a muov. meat, and when
it takes place. The Northern press tells us
their weak places, their poor generals, and, in
shdrt, their doubts, fears, and expectations. We
have spies and emissaries, friends and sympa-,
thizers in all the departments at Washington.
We will conquer the Federals as much by se-
cret agents and cabal, as by the swo-d and
mas ed batteries."
ITe stretched out his gauntleted hand, and,
laying it suddenly on Girdwood's arm, added, in
a raised and exultant voice :
" The fatal mistake of the Federals is, that
they cannot believe themselves seriously at war,

I tell you, sir, that war is a terrible giant, with'
iron remorsless fingers, and no May-day queen,
to be decked with wreaths and crowned with

"true-most true !" said Girdwood, so fer-
vently, that Hurdlestone fancied he had fired
him with his own dark enthusiasm.
Sentry after sentry was passed, to each of
hom IIurdlestone seemed well known.
" What roal is this ?" asked Girdwood.
" The Warrenton Road, over which the Fed-
erals will march to Manassas !" replied Hurdle-
stone, shrugging his shoulders.
"' ihat ravine and -vood is this, stretching
away before us ?'' queried the young man, gaz-
im  through the moonlit-mists of night, at the

with a peculiar lighting up of his eyes, " where
the Federal troops will stop to reuri sih thin-
selves in the cooling shades, when wear'v of their
'tramp down from Arlington. previous to their
triumphal entry into lanassas."
Hurdlestone lifted his shoulders again, and a
grim ghost of a smile appeared to give a amen-
ing to his face that Ralph could not fathom.
In truth, he was becoming every monument more
mystified with the rider of the black horse.
He was, clearly, a man -of strong prjumdices,
deep and ever-consuming passions, of m charac-
ter bold, resolute, and -unshrminkmg, and mex-
orably wedded to a purpose, disposed, like
inany others, to hold the prowess o his enemies
in contempt.
" This position is a strong-one, by 'nature,"
Ralph remarked.
"You tell me no news, young man." "answer-
ed Hurdlestone, turning from  the mamnrond
into a well-trodden path. Crossiby a ef rods
of rolling table-lamid, green with folige, they

low tones, and passed on.

them to a neat f'rrni-iouse, near which, on the

blacks were sleeping.
"Haimon ! Dagon !" said lurdlestone, slymarp-
ly. " This way, lazy fellows, and tale th. se
horses."  Then to Ralph :   " Dismount, sir.
Here our journey ends."
Two of the blacks arose slowly from the soft,
green pillow of Nature, and, after rubbing their
heavy eyes an instant, came briskly forward and
took charge of the hor-es, favoring Girdwood
with many inquisitive glances as they led the
animals away.

Come in," said Hurdlestone, with that cook-
ness of manner which had thus far marked his
deportment. le led the way through an open
piazza, followed by Girdwood. Opening a door
at his right, Hurdlestone entered an apartment
on the first floor, in which a lamp was dimly
burning. The same air of neatness that had iun
pressed him without, was apparent within, But
Ralph, as it happened, had no time for general
observation. A feminine figure, arising suddenly
from the obscure background, approached the
Confederate officer with quick steps and cut-
stretched hands, crying :

" If I am to appear before ladies, my toilet is
scarcely presentable," said Ralph,, glancing at
his travel-worn garments.
" These are times not to be over-particular.

These words were not uttered with, that gra-
ciousness which Ralph believed he had a right
to expect as a guest. Entering the roam to
which he had been conducted a few hours before,
he looked for Hope and the person whom Hur-
dlestone had mentioned. Neither were visible.
A table was spread in a neat and inviting man-
ner, and two black servants stood waiting for
ord'ei-s. A momn;nt after,'Miss Hurdlestone ap-
peared, and, greeting Girdwood in a friendly
manner, seated herself, behind the cofftee-urn.
Almost simultaneously, from' another door, a
man walked gravely in.
"Doctor Benedict, this is Mr. Girdwood, re-
eentl from Baltimore, through Washington and
the Federal lines."'
The man bowed slightly to Ralph, and took
the seat to which his host pointed. The young
man, sitting opposite to Doctor Benedict, was
impressed by his person and manners. . He was

eyes. His hair was somewhat gray.' The upper
lip was covered with a moustache. He wore a
plain military coat.'
The commencement of the meal was some-
what stiff; but presently Doctor Benedict began
to talk, and the constraint gradually wore off.
"What do-the people of Washington think of
this rebellion, Mr. Girdwood ?" he asked, sipping
his coffee, leisurely.
Just then Ralph saw Hope Hurdlestone look at
him. It struck him that her eyes warned him
of danger; at' least- he so construed their lan-
guage.
" There are many minds at Washington,''' an-
swered Ralph, guardedly. "The President and
Cabinet feel assured that the Union will be pre-
served, and the rebellion crushed. There are
others who predict, with equal confidence, that
&amp;e seceded States will never returnito their alp
legianee."_
" And what do you think ?"
The eyes of Doctor Benedict were now lifted
full upon Girdwood, who fancied they beamed
with a wild and ambitious light. Before he re-
lied to this home-question, he glanced at MisI
iurdlestone, and  1w the same warning lan-'
guage in her face.

" My opinion," he said, discreetly,' "can be
worth little to persons of more years and expe-
rience than, myself. I will say this, however,
the South underrates the power of the North."
"How many men has General Scott within a
day's march of Washington ?" continued Doctor
Benedict, deliberately.
"A   hundred thousand,"  answered Ralph,
promptly.
" It's false I" exclaimed Hurdlestone, angrily.
" Patience, patience, Colonel Hurdlestone ! I
think the young man is right," said Benedict,
with easy self-possession.
" Pardon me, sir. You have mistaken my
rank. I am simply a captain in the Black
Horse," responded Hurdlestone, pettishly..
" Nay, my friend, itis you who are mistaken.
You were a captain-yesterday ; but you are a
colonel to-day. I have it from good authority."
DoctorBenedict held up a hot roll in his white
hand, and looked tranquilly at his host, who for
a moment wasconfused.
" My blunder, I trust, is pardonable, doctor,
if you bear in mind the circumstance that I have
been absent more than twenty-four hours. The
general has,.no doubt, judged my ability by my
zeal, and, thereby, done me too much honor.
On him be the consequences of my inefficiency."
.IHurdlestone's voice had its usual hardness ;
but even his stern visage could not conceal his
inward satisfaction.
" A responsibility lie will readily accept, no
doubt," said the doctor. "How is Baltimore,
Mr. Girdwood ?"
" Under the heel of the Unio.n. The guns of
Fort -eMHenry are turned upon. that devoted
city, and at the first rising of the people it will
be laid in.ashes," responded Ralph.
"I like not such talk," said the colonel.
" The truth," interposed Doctor Benedict, "is
always better than falsehood. Baltimore, in-
deed, lies panting at the feet of the North ; but
when the grand army of the South moves for-
ward, her shackles shall be broken."
Ralph looked up from his coffee, and per-
ceived that the'speaker's face was flushed with
eome strong feeling that was at work within him.
" Will they bring down those pct lambs of
Wilson's ?" he continued.
' I see, sir, that you have fallen into the com-
mon error concerningthe ' pet lambs,' so called.
Wilson's Zonaves are not in th-e Gran I Ariy of
.the Potomac, nor have they been there. By
this time they are in Fort Pickens,' answered
.Ralph.
" That, cannot be, sir !" exclaimed Hurdle-
stone. ."I have seen the led-capped ruffians
myself, at Alexandria."-
" Pardon me, colonel! You saw Ellsworth's
Fire Zonaves ; quite a different body of men,"

"I give you my word of honor," -replied
Ralph, earnestly, that such a rallying-cry was
never heard within the Federal lines."
"I have never believed it for a'moment I"
said Hope, with suffused face.  .
" Traitor!" snarled Hurdlestone. But wheth-
er he meant Hope -or Girdwood, was not quite
apparent. "Dagon !" he added.
"Here mass colonel !" answered the black,
promptly.
"Do you know whatthe abolitionists are try-
ing to do?"
"Yes, massa. Dey's coming' down to play de
mischief wid de poor nigs. I o'pect we'll have a
hard time in de corn-fields ob de North. I's
heerd it's drefful cole there, -mass . Dey say

Doctor Benedict smiled.
"What are the-New York Fire Zouaves, Da-
gon ?"
" Bress you, mass colonel, dey's de debbil
hisself! I's tole, yes'day, dey eat de little nigs
fast 's dey can cotch 'em, and make nottin''t all
ob it. Begins to be steered, I doess"
While Dagon stood winking and blinking be-
hind his master's chair; a great deal cast down
in view of the calamities hanging over the curly
heads of the juvenile blacks, the colonel's cate-
ehising was brought to an abrupt termination
by the hurried tread of feet, and the sudden en-
tr.ince of armed men with a prisoner, with his
hands tied behind him, pushed forward by bay-.
onets and swords. .-
The surprise of Girdwood was not slight in
recognizing in the luckless captive Captain
Scotto, the tall and muscular Federal whom he
had encountered the night before on the line of
the Union pickets..
The eyes of the prisoner, after wandering-
around tihe room a moment, fell upon Ralph.
" We've met afore, I reckin ?" said Scotto.
" You's under a cloud, then'; sy turn now."
" Do you know this - man ?" asked. Doctor
Benedict, turning sharply to-Ralph.
." I narrowly escaped his: bullet last 'night ;
but I bear no hardness. He- had me fairly at
his mercy, for a short time ; but, thanks to a
quick hand and eye, and a good horse, I made
ny escape."
" It was harnsonely done, if you be a p'ison-
ed Secesher !" said Scotto, planting his foot in
the stomach of a soldier who 'had goaded hoim
heyond endurance. The fellow fell upon his

'back, with his gun across him, in a very gro-
tesque fashion. " Lay there, .you, mean critter!
Can't you let a man alone Ven you've got him
snug and fast? A brave man don't exult-over
his inemy when he's got the better of him. If
I only had my hands untied, I'd make sickness
for some of ye !'
Scotto looked at his captors threateningly.
" Tell ye what ! some of you Black Hoss
riptiles'll lose the number of your mess, if you
ain't a leetle keerful. I've got a handful of cal-
vary myself, that have got some'at to say about
this ere business. You can hang me to. the
nearest tree, if you want to;^but that won't ex-
tarminate the'Independent Rangers. I did want
to live the year out, that I might eat my big-
ness into this rotten rebellion ; theft I might
hack, hew, and sloew; that I might see. the ,old
flag take the place of the new secession rag i
But, if I can't fight, I car hang, or knock under
in any way whatsornever you may light on."
Scotto drew himself up very straight, and
flashed on his enemies bravely.
" What is your name ?" asked Doctor Bene-
dict.
"Scotto," answered the captain, with honest
boldness.
" Scotto, the Scout !" exclaimed IHurdlestone.
" You rebels may have called me so, fust or
last. I'd rather be Scotto, the Scout, than
Beauregard, the Traitor !" retorted the prison-
er, fearlessly.
" Up with him, boys of the Black Horse !"
cried l1urdlestone. "You'll find a tree hard
" I think I've heerd that voice afore. Ain't
you one of the shovelry that run away, at Phil-
lippi ? I's in that bit of a scrimmage myself,"
said Scotto,'coolly.
Hurdlestone scowled, and bit his lip.
The soldiers began to drag him away.
" Stay I" said Benedict, in a voice of authori-
ty. "I always like to have a hand in hanging
and such things. I wish to question this Yan-
kee. Fall back !"
The men fell bsck to the door, leaving Seetto
in the open ,paee between them and the table.
" I breathe better," he said. "This rebel
air isn't good for Northern lkngs."
"Are you willing to take the oath of allegiance,
sir ?" asked' Doctor Benedict, whose sharp, im-
perative manner somewhat perplexed Girdwood.
"I 'can't talk,' gineral, or cap'n, or whatsomev-
er you may be, with strings-onto me," answered
Scotto "'If you think its. oncommon danger-
ous lettin' my hands- loose, you can jest shet
down the winders, and let your seceshers cock
their pieces and bring 'em to a charge; though
it's been thought, hereaways, that one of your
rebels was ekal to five Yankees."
" Untie him," said Doctor Benedict.
One of the soldiers obeyed, with singular
alaclity and .ilenee. Girdwood marveled that


SCOTTO, THE SCOUT ; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.

Colonel Hurdlestone showed so much defer-a
ence to this Doctor Benedict.
" There !" said Scotto, stretching out his long
arms. " That's more like life, liberty, and the
pursuit o' happiness. Your the only decent
Cornfederate I've seen. If you's fightin' in a
good cause, you mought be a gentleman. The,
old flag, sir ! The old flag !"
Scotto looked up as if he expected to see the
dear old Stripes above him.
"Take a cup of coffee, to warm your heart,
air," said Hope.
" That's woman, all ,over !" quoth Scotto.
" Bless your pretty face ! my heart's warm
enough for four. Do you know what makes it-
warm, lass ? It's loyalty to the Great .Repub-
lic! There's Bunker Hill into it, and Leexing-
ton, ard Concord, and Ticonderoga. .That's
where I git the fire, gal." Then to Benedict :
"Now, sir, fire away.!"   .
"iWill you take the oath ?" asked Benedict,
somewhat moodily.
" The which ?"
"The oath of allegiance."
"Allegiance to what $" asked Scotto, tartly.
"To the Southern Confederacy "
"Afore. God, I know of no sich institution !
May the. grass grow over me afore I know it !"
cried the scout, with a burst of enthusiasm
His interrogator frowned darkly.
" You will not swear-?" he said.
" If all the trees in gender run was men, and
all the branches and leaves on 'em Was bago-
nets, and all the grass growing' round 'em was
dead-shot rifles, and if all the sunbeams let
down from heaven was rebel halters, I swear to
ye that I wouldn't swear allegiance to your one-
horse consarn ! You wince, do ye ? Prehaps
you ain't, in the natur' o' things, dead to con-
demnation and remorse. Think of what you've
lost ! You've lost the Revolution ; you've lost
your history ; you've lost the Cowpens, and
the memory of the Swamp Fox, and the San-
tee !"
"No matter what we have lost," said Bene-
diet, after a pause. "You are about to lose
that which makes loss and gain the same thing."
Then to one of the men who had brought him
to the farm-house: "Where was this man tak-
en ?"
" Within our pickets, not far from Fairfax
Court-House.  He tried to pass himself off,
when surprised and questioned by our cavalry,
as a Confederate scout, and resisted when told
that he must go to head-quarters," was the re-
ply.
"There need b'e little waste of timein exam-
ining this man," said Hurdlestone. "He was
with Scott in Mexico. His business there was
to obtain information of the enemy's move-
ments. He was the most efficient scout in the
service. To please the then victorious general,
there was no secret skrviee too dangerous for

him to undertake. Ie would have been a good
man on the right side ; but being on the wrong,
our duty is plain."
" Pity that some whioh Went to Mexico hadn't
died there : I have a man in my eye "-the
scout advanced a step,'and looked sternly at
Benedict-" I have a man in my eye which
once had a good name. I have a man in my
eye as went, to the battle-fields of Mexico, a ris-
in' and accomplished officer, but whose name is
now so black with treason that all the waters of
the. Gulf wouldn't wash it white !"
Benedict recoiled. A burning blush redden-
ed his face. He gnawed his nether lip, as if in
pain, and when he again spoke, his voice was
husky with anger, or some other emotion.
" Life is worth something to every one," b
said.
"Honor is worth more," interposed Scotto.
" Death and the devil !" roared Hurdlestone,
" Do you presume to teach us what honor is ?"
" Too late for that !" sighed Scotto.
"Enter our service ; serve us as faithfully as
you have General Scott, and your life is saved,"
said Benedict.
" Never! never!'
" Luke Scotto, you will be hanged !",
"If you are not hanged, it will bo a singular
thing in the 'history of nations !" retorted the
scout, emphatically. " Your face, name, and
fame are alike known to me. In days to come,
the names of Beauregard, Davis, and a few oth-
ers, will be recorded with that of Benedict Ar-
nold, and held in the same contempt. That's
prophecy, you may depend on't !"
. Girdwood, at that moment, sound himself
standing near Miss-Hurdlestone. While the at.
tention of the other parties was fixed upon tho
prisoner, she whispered in his ear:
-' It isrBeauregard !"
Her eyes glanced intelligently at Benedict.
Another steadfast look at the compact figure of
the latter, fully assured Ralph that he was in
the presence of the distinguished rebel general,
and. he comprehended at once the significant
words of the scout.
The deportment of the man had perplexed
him from the first, but he was no longer a mys.
tery. He mastered his surprise, and his grate-
ful eyes thanked Hope Hurdlestone. While she
was present, he was forgetful of his own posi-
tion ; and he felt that her silent influence threw
a protecting shadow over the prisoner, whose
fate he now watched with the deepest interest.
",You are not here -to talk polities," said
Beauregard, whose assumed name we shall now
lay aside. "We want money and ammunition
more than Yankee sentiment. I will give you yet
another chance forlife. Your shrewdness will
soon tell you in what that chance consists You
might not have any objections to tellin -me
how many men General Scott has on the Po-
tomac ?"

SCOTTO, THE SCOUT; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.

" I bought, and then ag'in I moughtn't I" an-
swered, Scotto, with great self-possession.
" Think not that aniy recollections of Mexico,
on my part, will save you," added Beauregard.
"1We are engaged in a desperate struggle, and
a single life is as the fall of a leaf in the forest.
War will have its terrible dues. We will pay
tribute with our own blood and the blood of our
e enies. Valuable information, however, shll
he, rewarded. You hold in your hand the bal-
anee of life and death ; turn the scale which
way you will. You have free access to General
Scott.  You know his plans. Make a clean
breast, and a colonel's commission in the Con-
federate Army shall be yours, as soon as it can
be ratified by the'proper powers."
Beauregard folded bis arms upon his chest,
and looked steadily at the scout.
Scotto stood unmoved and motionless. His
sun-burned face kept sacredly the secret of his
thoughts till his lips were r. ady to speak them.
Every eye was fixed on him. H'pe Hurdle-
stone, with parted lipa and suppressed breath,
waited for his answer.
"1You are silent," said Beauregard, impa-
tiently.
The scout drew himself straight and firm as a
Virginia pine.
" I live and die under the old flag !" he said,
slowly and distinctly. " I want no commission
among rebels. I despise both the Treason and
the Traitor. The 'secrets that are within me,
you'll have to cut out with your bowie-knives ;
and I've heerd you're mighty handy with them
things. You hew down Union men like savages,
because they dare to have opinions of their
own. If you'd stop there, we could look upon
ye as half-civilized Ingins; but you  don't.
Helpless women have been whipped, imprison-
ed, and insulted. The North has no such rec-
ord of shame and outrage. Do you s'pose, sir,
Heaven'll bless sich a cause ? Wilt the God of
battles shet His eyes and let the bad passions of
men run wild ?   No, sir ! No! He planted-
this Republic, and He'llkeep it, though it run
red with blood ! What's death ? What's the
hangin' up of this six feet of flesh of mine, com-
pared with the mighty interests at stake ? Bring
out your halters. String up sueh loyal men as
you can lay hands on, and see what the end
on't'll be. Come on, traitors! I am ready !"
'es" You shall be hanged in ten minutes !" said
Beauregard, with compressed lips and scowling
brow.
" Thank ye, gen'ral! That's nine minutes
mare nor I expected," replied Scotto, compos-
edly. "I die for the Union!"
Filled with admiration for the scout, Ralph
Girdwood could no longer resist the impulse to
say something in his favor.
" Let me entreat you, sir, to save this brave
fellow," he said, addressing Beauregard.
"Spare your breath, sirI" replied the gener-

al, with freezing coldness and a-flash of the eye
that was far from encouraging.
. " Soldiers," said Hurdlestone, in a voice in
which no sympathy could be detected, "make
ready outside there."
Two or three of the men touched their caps,
and hastened with great apparent satisfaction to
obey this portentous order.
"For humanity's sake," began Ralph, with
much earnestness, when a keen and menacing
glance from Beauregard stopped him.
"I am obleeged to ye, young man," said
Scotto, " for daring to speak a word for me ; but
it's no use. A man who betrays his country
won't show marey. Benedict Arnold, you re-
member, was the worst on 'em all, arter he
went over to the Britishers. Should you ever
happen to see the old hero, Scott, tell him I've
kicked the air at last, and shan't bring him no
more news. Tell him, also, that there's a couple
o' boys that I've took care on for about a dozen
year, that may or mayn't be brothers, who'll
need lookin' arter, I bein' hung and gone.
They're with my scouting' Rangers, Peleg and
Pickerin' by name, and full o' fight by natur'.
I've no doubt the old gen'ral would help 'em,
some'at, should they come to want. I'd like to
be'decent buried, but I don't s'pose it'll make
any great odds whether one's body rests atop or
aneath the airth."
He paused an instant, and looking sternly at
Beauregard, said, interrogatively:
"There's no sich thing as shootin', I a'-
pose ?"
" The fate of the spy is fixed from time im-
memorial," answered Beauregard, lifting his
eyes with strange intensity upon Girdwood,
whose lips and cheeks grew white.
"Major Andr6 was hanged," mused Scotto.
"lHe was a fine fellow, too. I know a brace of
critters, travelin' that road, that the same can't
be said on."
"All ready !" said a voice at the door.
" Away with him I" ordered the general, per-
emptorily.
Before a hand could be laid upon Scotto,
Hope Hurdlestone sprang between him and the
soldiers.
" Perpetrate not such a crime !" she cried,
"Add not cold-blooded murder to your disloy-
alty. This man's death will aid you not. ()
General Beauregard, hear me, hear inc " She
sank upon her knees at his feet.
"Woman's natur' ak'in - woman's natur' 1'
murmured Scotto. " Good gal! good gal!"
Beauregard gently repulsed her, but she
grasped his hand and held it.
" You pain and embarrass me, Miss Hurdle-
.stone," he said, with some displeasure.
" Hope Hurdlestone," exclaimed her father,
sternly, " you disgrace me !"
" General-general !" added Hope, " heed my

"If you love the old flag, we are friends," she
Answered, with a flush of enthusiasm. "But
about this brave fellow," she added, quickly,
pointing to the room where Scotto was secured.
"He must escape 1"
" Exactly my own thought, Miss Hurdlestone.
I see no necessity of sacrificing such a life. How
to assist him, however, is a matter of much per-
lexity. I have great faith in your sagacity, and
his cool judgment and quick hand. Once out-
side this house, there will be.a strong probabil-
ity in his favor."
" There is another who may be useful in this
endeavor. You will distrust my judgment when
I inform you that I trust the fidelity of the
black, Dagon."
Hope Hurdleston smiled.
Just then the shadow of a sentinel moved
slowly across the window-panes.
"Your opinion is of more weight than mine;,
but I certainly should be disposed to doubt
him, after hearing, as I did, his grotesque views,
pf the North, as drawn forth ,by the colonel,
your father."  -
" Believe not half you-hear from Dagon and
Haimon.   They are wiser than they .seem.
Duplicity is taught the blacks from childhood
by the stern lessons of servitude."-
Both Hope and Ralph now stood facing the
widows that opened on the piazza. Whenever
theyisaw the automatic (figure of a sentinel,
they stopped speaking, and went on when his
short rounds took him out of sight.
"Dat's true, Missy Hurd'stone !" said a voice
behind them, that startled Ralph not a little.
" Dat's true as the book of the Gospils ! But,
Missy Hope, what makes ye for to go on in dis
yer way? This am a ha'uted house. Dar am
ghosts in the body, that walk 'bout and has
ears. You's been talking' treason a heap, and I
list crep' in and heerd it by dar back door."
It was Dagon who thus surprised them.
"No matter, Dagon, so long as you were the
only listener," said Miss Hurdlestone, without
apparent apprehension.
" Dat, yer a'n't no s'cuse, missy," persisted
Dagon, in a very serious manner. " You's too
good for to be found out and cotched up by the
'ceshers. I knows I's a contraban'; but the
children o' darkness is sometimes wiser nor the
children o' light."
Ralph heard these wojds with secret consterna-
Ron and dread. His onfidence in the black
was not equal to the influence which he believ-
ed he might. exert on Hope and himself. Nor
could lie forget the catechism of the morning,
in which Dagon had expressed his loyalty to his
master and the South.
Miss Iurdlestone, perceiving his apprehen-

shone,"and suspecting rightly their cause, hasteu-
ed to allay them.
"Fear not Dagon," she said.  He is one of
the faithful'among the unfaithful. I would trust
him with my life."
" res ye, Missy Hope, you might well say
that yer 1" interposed Dagon, with a visible
deepening of his voice and feelings. " You is
the only cretur that keeps me 'wong do 'cesh,
anyways. You see I isn't what I was. I's no
longer a nigger, nor a chattel, but a contraban'.
Now these yer contraban's, missy, can go any-
whar they wants to. I 'spect we's alleys been
contraban's, but nobody tole us. Abe Linkura
was the fust man thatgive us the 'telligence, and
I pray the Lor' in his massy to bress him for it,
whether he be black or white ; though Mas'r
Hurd'stone says he's black as the aceo' cards,
and that Missus Linkum is the same. Though,"
added Dagon, with a puzzled look, ItI don't see
how that is, as she's got a brudder in the 'cesh
army, white as anybody."
"Is it possible, Miss Hurdlestone," asked
Ralph, smiling, "that such absurd stories are
circulated in the seceding States "
"Not only circulated, but believed," replied
Hope. "It was hardly good manners, Dagon,
to steal upon us in this fashion," she added. " If
I did not know your fidelity, I should be serious-
ly displeased with you. You heard our conver-
sation ?"
"'Bout every swyllable, missy-'bout every
swyllable, I should reekin' I" answered Dagon,
coolly. "But it's safe-safe as a bigger in a
swamp afore he's missed. Dis yer contraban'
was list on the look-out for ye, and that's the
truth. Tie colonel hisself, might come 'pon you
onawar's ; but lie couldn't do it while dis yer
nig was watching . Then the sogers, with the
one- pronged forks on dar guns, might been put-
tin' dar ,cars to one place and another, whar
they hadn't no business."
".Well, Dagon, since you know what we were
talking of, what is your opinion of the matter ?
She looked toward the room in which was
Scotto.
"I's drefful 'feard, missy, he'll wear the hemp
collar. 'F Is found tryin' to help him off,
shouldn't stan' no chance 't all. Judges and

gits. Don't aspectt it's Abe Linkum hisself, shut

Mas'r would knowed him. But that don't make
no odds. He's in trouble, and I's boun' to help

"What with General Beauregard, what with

Zadoc laid hold of the general's arm with as
little reverence as if it had been a fire-arm, felt
the muscles, and examined the small, white hand
carefully and curiously.
" Thar's a mistake hyar I" he said, sliaking
his head skeptically. "'Thi war not the. thing
that done it. Hook hold on me ag'in."
The Confederate chief good-liumoredly took
himby the arm and spun him round like a top.
"All right !" said Zadoc, manifestly quite satis-
fied and relieved, as well as forgetful of his
wrath toward' Hurdleston. ." Them's the pat-
ent double-action fingers, though they ain't big-
ger nor a woman's."
A momentary glow of pride appeared on
Beauregard's face. He had been noted for his
strength.
" Friend Murch," he said, his mind instantly
reverting to the intelligence he had just heard,
are you sure that you are not deceived ?"
" Sure as a rifle-cannon ! If thar war any
doubt, I should told ye. Kurnel Garnett was
shot while tryin' to rally his men, and thar war
bad work. Soon arter, Pegrani, who was wan-
derin'- about in the mountains, caved in, and
trott.d into the Yankee camp with a thousand
men. They did so, gin'ral !"
Girdwood saw Hurdlestone frowning at Jiis
daughter, whose face expressed anything but
grief.
" A thousand prisoners !" mutter ed Beaure-
gard.
" Which were let go on their peril of honor,"
interposed Zadoe.
Looking up, the general saw a smile on Hope's
lips, and tried to quell her with his eyes, but was
discomfited, and smiled himself.
" The otlth of allegiance !" sneered Hurdle-
store. " They hanged the officers, I suppose ?"
" No-; but they embalmed one on 'em,, and
sent hiii, to his friends in a nice lox."
llurdlestone was confused.
" I believe little," he said, " in Northern cour-
tesy and mercy."
- Nobody axed you tol" retorted Zadoe.
Wh keers for their courtesy or niassy ?. But
the Feds war fools, though, in p'int o' common'
senae, to let their prisoners go arter takin' a
sw'a.- all round. Why, I sometimes sw'ar by
the tour together, and think nothing' on't. They
call this the peril of honor, the Feds do, 'cause
if they're cotched in arms, arterward, they'll
be shot."
" Their parole will not, in all cases, be re-
spected, I think," said Hurdlestone, with a
shrug.
" What are you going to do with these boys,
Mr. Much ?" asked the general..
" I'm gwine to l'arn 'em to be wise as sar-
pents. I'm gwine to train'em up to thump and
squeak right among the cannon-balls. it's a
private band, you see. I have 'em the same a

over, jest squeak and pound a beetle louder, and
I'll up and at it ag'in."
"Come with me, Zadoc," said the general;
4 and you, also, clonel."
The Confederate chief lingered a moment on
the threshold, looked searchingly at Girdwood
and Miss Hurdlestone, then thoughtfully retired
to that apartment which had so many secrets,
and kept them so well, followed by the colonel
and Zdoc Murch.
CHAPTER VIII.
TiE MASKED BATTERIES OF MANAS SAS.
Girdwood passed the dpy as well as he could
in the circumscribed limits assigned him. Some-
times standing on the open piazza, he watched
the streamsof Confederate soldiers flowing and
fluctuating this way and that ; sometimes lie
east his eyes inquiringly up the Run, wondering
why so much animation pervaded it ; sometimes
he noted officers, in gay uniforms, appearing
and disappearing mysteriously in the woods;
sometimes he listened to the vague niurniur of
camps ; sometimes the blast of the bugle echoes
through the hills and valleys, with a wild yet
stirring effect ; sometimes he marked messen-
gers coming in hot haste to the head-quarters
of the rebel chief ; and sometimes he listened'
to the light step of Hope Hurdlestone within.
Random pistol and musket shots ; occasion-
ally the boom of cannon, with near or distant
bursts of martial music, mingled with muffled
voices ; the sound of busy axes, and the crash
of falling trer a far in the depths of the forest,
all conspired to give him a lively impression of
the realities of war and the zeal of the Confed-
erates.
He saw the sun set, at length, with a feeling of
relief on the imperfectly-seen and comli're,hend-
ed activities of the Run. As the dimness of
evening fell, the guard was doubled, and their
vigilance increased. A sentinel was stationed
in the narrow hall, near Scotto's door. His
hope for the scout waned as he beheld these
precautions. He mentioned his fears to Miss.
Hurdleston, whose despondency Was greater
than his own. From Beauregard he had re-
ceived no further attention. That important
personage, on whom centred so many thoughts
and expectations, had been busy several hours
with his clerks ; while the colonel was absent,
scouring the country with the Black Horse
Rangers. His absence might be protracted
through the night, or he might appear at any
moment.
. One of Zadoc's boys was found asleep in'the
hall. The sentinel shook him ; but he was se

pitiably weary and drowsy. that, after being I
shaken awhile, he was allowed to slumber on,
with his drum beside him.
Ralph breathed a few words of encourage-
ment to Hope. but with so little enthusiasm that
they failed of their purpose. He was conscious
of being little else than a prisoner himself, and
this feeling was equally well understood by her
Whether within or without, he knew he was ob-
served, and that knowledge was so annoying to
his pride, that he sought solitude in the chamber
that had been allotted him, utterly despairing
of being of any service to the unfortunate scout,
whose firm tread he could occasionally hear be-
neath him. Although his mind had much to
occupy it, his own safety among other consider-
ations, lie could not help thinking of the pris-
oner doomed at ten in the morning. Earnestly
he deplored the stern usages of war that ren-
dered such sacrifices necessary, or, at least,
sanctioned them with belligerent powers. He
did not thiuk: of repose, but sat with his face
buried in his hands, pondering upon the dark
scenes about to open upon the Old Dominion
and other hitherto peaceful-States. Once or
twice lie heard a fife squeaking shrilly various
negro melodies, but did not heed it. Several'
plans for the rescue of the loyal scout came and
went,; but lie was painfully conscious that his
position was too critical to compromise it by
any possibly apparent interference.
In the quietude and darkness he remained
some hours, without any particular realization
of the passage of time.'
'Some one entered his chamber. Raising his
head, he perceived a figure, dim, and scarcely
distinguishable in the obscurity. This figure
must have stolen up very softly, for he heard
nothing until a moccasined foot tapped lightly
on the floor.
" Are ye hyar ?" asked a voice, which, though
quite recognizable, was pitched on a soft and,
seemingly, cautious key.
" I am here," answered.Girdwood, falling in--
to the same tone, and feeling quietly for his
side-arms.     ,
"What do you want?"
"If I'd a wanted to harm ye, could done it-
couldn't 1?" responded 'Murcl. "Stood look-
in' a minute afore I made a noise. Thinkin' a
good deal, ain't ye ? Prehaps it's the gal; pre-
haps ag'in, it's other things?"
Ralph knewnot whether to resent this famil-
iarity or pass it over ; the latter course seemed
the wisest. He was about to give a careless re-
ply, when Zadoc added:'
"W hy don't you air your legs, some'at?
There's a bit o' moon in the sky, a shimmerin'
like pale silver on the woods. Let's walk."
"Really, Mr. Murch," said Girdwood, consid-
erably embarrassed in view of the restriction
laid upon him, " I scarcely feel like walking to-
night. -I am not well, I believe."

Zadoe s wide gash of a mouth seemed to grow
wider with a cunning smile.
' I know your health's awful delikit .Lut I
thought that preliaps a sight of ' our works
moughtn't do ye no harm !" he answered.
"1, should liketo see them; but-but-"
Ralph hesitated, for it was revolting to his
pride to confess the truth.
i" Look 'e hyar !" Murcli dallied with his huge
bowie-knife. The young man looked,'but saw
nothing unusual. A bushy figure loomed up
before him, and that was all.
"Now is your time! Come with ne! I'm
wildcat! ' I'm Kentuck, Carline, Texas, and old
Missip b'iled down. I'm a bitter tea for any
one as molests me. Come along!"
"It's impossible !" answered Girdwood, im-
patiently, arising, and standing face to face with
Murch.
" Thar's no sich word as that ar in my Chioe-
taw dictionary," answered Zadoc. "Wliat I sets
my mind on, I do, lnd nothin' on airth can stop
me. Trust in a Mississip;valley crocodile. and
;ome arter me without fear. And, stop! Look 'e
hyar! If a guard speaks, to ye, say'* Warren-
ton.' Warrenton will take 'em down. TlIar's
nothin' can stan' Warrenton hyar to-night."
Girdwood was surprised; but adjusting his
arms, lie followed Zadoc Murch, who added, as
they crossed the threshold :
" You needn't take pa'ins to step louder nor
nat'ral, for B'uregard is at his dietatin' and writ-
in' yet. He's allers late to bed, and liar's no
need o' disturbin' him."
Girdwood descended the stairs full of doubt
and uncertainty, and treading very lightly. A
bayonet stopped hii at the door. He whisper-
ed " Warrenton." The glittering steel quivered
an instant, then dropped, and lie passed on.
Another line of sentinels was passed in the same
manner.
"Now," said Mureh, "we'll go up the ravine.
We shall now and then 'be challenged ; but you
know what to say."
Zadoe, leading with steady, assured -steps,
crossed the Warrenton Road and struck into the
woods. The ground was uneven, lying in irreg-
ular swells, with occasionally sharp hills and
deep valleys.' They reached a stream or run,
dry in most places, but with here and there a.
pool of stagnant water.
Girdwood began to feel a strange hum of life
around him.
" Look thar !" said Zadoe, pointing with his
brown finger.
"I see nothing," replied Ralph, " but an in-
distinct maze of shrubbery."
"Do you hear nothing ?" pursued Zadoc.
"Yes, voices, and the hum of human pres-
ence," said Ralph.
" Come on !" added Murch.
"I smell the smoke of smould'ing amp.
I fires," said Ralph.

" Who goes there ?" cried a sentinel.
" Friendss" answered both.
Advance, friends, and give the counter-
sign."
nWrrenton !"
" Warrenton goes. Pass, friends I
" What do ye see hyar ?" asked Mureb. His
great aim lifted slowlyaand fixedly indicating a
certain point.
"rA masked battery !" replied Girdwood.
Zadoe Murch turned and strode on.
"Look yonder."
"I see a wall of brush," replied Ralph, and his
eccentric guidestalked 'on again. The word
" Warrentomi" seemed omnipotent.
"What do ye see now ?" -
A masked battery, and dying camp-fires !"
The broad figure of Zadoe Mureh pushed for-
ward through the oak openings. The white
moonlight fell upon him- as he moved on. A
hundred-two hundred yards, were traversed.
" Thar !" said Zadoe, abruptly- swinging his
chubby arm in a certain direction. "What
now?"
" Some dried limbs, and the tall, undulating
grass," said Ralph.
Another short walk and another pause.,
"What ag'in ?"   1
" Masked batteries, camps, and dying camp-
fires !"
Zadoc glanced at his companion, filled his
mouth with tie strong Indian weed, and chew-
ing it savagely, resumed his steady course on-
ward.
Soldiers started up from sleep and fell back
heavily. A few restless ones looked after them
dreamily; while now and then an acquaintance
gave Murci rough greeting, or semt after him
words of badinage., To these the man gave
little heed. He seemed absorbed. Some over-
powering thought was evidently working in his
mind.
"What place is this ?" questioned Girdwood.
" The way to Manassas !" replied Mureb.
The young man felt a chill upon him. Thiuk-
Ing many things, lie followed his conductor.
The position appeared fortified by nature.
" Look once more," continued Zadoc.
",A phalanx of trees," responded Ralph.
" Come on! Now what ?"
The suggestive arm was again raised.
" A masked battery, camps, and dying camp-
fires !" -
The moonbeams fell in white threads upon
the silent guns. The Confederate soldiers turn-
ed unconsciously in their sleep, dreaming of
distant friends.  The brands smoked in the
rough and now-deserted kitchens. And thus
the woodland walk continued, and battery after
battery 'iet the eyes of Girdwood
Miles of broken wooded country, rolling table-
land, hills and vales, were traversed in this man-

ner, with the constant recurrence of batteries
and camps.
Ralph was greatly impressed with what he be-
held. He was perplexed, too, with the strange
conduct of his guide, whose taciturnity was un-
looked for. They finally left' the forest, to re-
turn by a different route ; first, to cross some
swampy ground, then through open fields and
occasional clusters of oaks.
"What have you seen ?" asked Murch."
"What may be called a zig-zag line of forts,
extending between two and three miles," answer.
ed Girdwood.
"Can the Federals take it ?"
Zadoc turned a curious look at the young
man.
"Not without the advantage of numbers, and
terrible loss of life !" replied Ralph, thought
fully.
" Jes' so I Now do you know the name of
that thar place ? It's called Bull Run, here.
about.".
"tA place I never head mentioned at Wash-
ington, or within the lines of the army of the
Potomac. Tell me, Mr. Much, have our ene-
mies no scouts ?"
" Oh yes! Touton B'uregard's going' to hang
one in the mornin !"%
" Can it he possible," said Girdwood, continue
ing the same train of reflection, " that the Yan-
kees know nothing of the masked batteries of
Manassas ?"
" You'd better say nothin' about what you've
seen down ihyar," added Mureb. "If B'uregard
knowed where you'd been, you'd be treated to
lost quarters till arter the advance of the inemy.
That's a secret he gards like the apple of his
"Why, then, have you led me through Bull
Run ?" queried Ralphi.
Look 'e hyar! Thar's things that musn't
he talked about, nor meddled with. This is one
on 'em. You've seen what no livin' man can
see, not in full fellership with the Confeds, and

us, and 'tan't 'no matter 'bout motives. But I
can tell ye this : the Fed's'Il be cut up cruel, if
they go down thar without knowin' what they're
goin' into. I predict for 'em a bloody rout,
sieb as was never seen in these parts. I, Zadoe
Murch, say it !"
By this time they were near the farm house.
' Go in," he added, "and keep your own
counsel. Breathe not a word of this breach
old hoss. Look well to your own neck. Goo
bye, till we meet ag'in."
With this closing exhortation, delivered in a
friendly tone, Zadoc Mureh turned on his, heel,
and went his way.

SCOTTO, THE SCOUT; OR, THE UNION RANGES.

CHAPTER IX.
CHANGE o   F QUARTERS.
Girdwood went quietly to his room. It was
midnight ; and, soon after, he heard the rebel
chief retire to his chamber ; but, apparently,
not to sleep, for his restless footsteps we e audi-
ble for a long time.
The young man stretched himself on his bed ;
but thoughts of the prisoner below, and Hope
Ilurdlestone, banished repose, and when lie at
length slumbered, he dreamed of masked bat-
teries.
He met Hurdlestone, and Hope, and the gen-
eral at the breakfast-table, at a late hour in the
morning. He was treated with marked coldness'
by the latter. He watched Hope's countenance,
hoping to get good news from it respecting Luke
Scotto ; but her expression was downcast and
anxious. The meal passed in comparative si-
lence, and Ralph was heartily glad when it was
ended. The guard still environed the house,
and a soldier stood leaning on his musket at
Scotto's door.-
" You'd better leave the room, Hope," said
the colonel.
The young woman shook her head, and re-
mained.
Low orders were given, and preparations of
some nature were made in the clump of oaks
before the house. Girdwood tried to get an op-;
portunity to speak to Hope., Gradually getting
near her, he whispered: .
" Has anything been done, Miss Hurdlestone 2"
" No," she answered ; "no chance has been
given. The surveillance has been so close that-
found it impossible to move. Poor fellow I"
Ralph sighed, and, perceiving the eyes of
Beauregard upon him, colored.
A file of men appeared.
"Take hiim out!' said Hurdlestone, in a sup-
pressed voice, glancing at his daughter, and
leavin gthe roam.
"Imeant,' said Hope, addressing Beaui'e-
gard, " to have appealed to your magnanimity
again; but see, by your expression, that the
gates of mercy are closed. You are fortified,
in advance, against the attacks of pity.
"You are right, Miss Hurdlestone. Spare
yourself humiliation, and me a scene."
This was uttered in a manner that offended the
pride of Hope.
"If your bandit ancestor were brought in
from the hills of Mexico." she added, with a
slight toss of the'heid, and asarcastic glitter of'
the eyes, " I would not put up cry nor prayer
for him!"
The face of the traitor-general reddened with
anger.
"You shall regret this. Miss- Hurdlestone !
To cast at me the foul slanders of the Northern
press, is something you might have spared me,
e without detriment to your cause and wishes."

Nay, the 'story came from your a.. a'al
hills; and you will find it in the Diario di Mejico;
also, translated and copied into sundry Anglo-
Saxon sheets," responded Hope, glad to see that
her shaft had taken effect.
", There's no military discipline for you, Miss
Hurdlestone. The tongue of your sex is a
weapon that cannot be guarded against. And
yet," he added, frowning, "even women have
sometimes suffered for political sins."
" They have been whipped in Southern lati-
tudes," murmured Hope.
" Death and the devil 1" cried the colonel, at
that moment. "Where's the prisoner ?"
A corporal had just opened the door, and was
starring, with open mouth, into Scotto's room.
The colonel, seeing him, dashed through the
hall, with the foregoing exclamation. He look-
ed into the dim, little apartment ; lie searched
every corner with his troubled eyes ; but Luke
Scotto was not there.- He had escaped. The
window was fastened, nothing was disturbed, and
Hurdlestone sought in vain for a clue to his
mysterious disappearance.
" We have been cheated and cajoled !" he
roared. " There are traitors among us 1"
"Colonel Hurdlestone,"   said Beauregard,
culdl,"bring out your man "
" General," an swered Hurdlestone, his voice
husky with anger, "he has escaped I I know
not how ; but the fact is obvious. The guards
have been tampered with, or the devil helped
him."
"A fair devil, I'll warrant I" retorted Beau'
regard, looking at Hope.
"I understand you, sir 1" said Hope, with
quiet hauteur.
"Nor do you deny the implication," resumed
the general.
"1The will, sir. I do not deny ; but the oppor.
unity I moat certainly do," she returned, with
dignity.
" She shall take his place, and feed on bread
and water I" protested the colonel, in geat ex-
citement. " in with you, miss-in with you I
I'll teach you that I can punish traitors of my
own household !"
Hope stood, calm and unmoved. She glanced
at the Confederate leader, with an expression
that said :
"See the storm you have raised !"
Girdwood remained, astounded, in the back-
ground.
Hurdlestone seemed determined to enforce his
hasty menace.
" Do you hear me, girl ?  You are no. daugh.

raged the colonel, striding, with angry gestures,
about the room.
" I will obey you. father, if you do not change
your mind, after a moment's reflection," an-
swered Hope, unruffled and dignified.

shrink from the approaches of the pitiless ty-
rant. Girdwood wished fervently for life and
its enjoyments.
He sat dawn, and his head sank into his hsnd-
ouffed lands. The love of Hope Hurdlestone
bad given a new charm to existence. He heard,

Hours rolled over the bowed head of Gird-
wood.'
When the night fell, a candle and writing-ma-
terials were brought and placed beside him, in
ominous silence.  In defiance of his strong
nerves, this circumstance shocked him not a
little; for it was full of meaning. It said : "If
you have any parting words to leave, you are
permitted to write them."
Atfirst, ie was tempt d to comply with this
invitation; but reflection changed his mind.
"If this is to be," lie mused, "I will die
without sign. or witness. Besides, it may be a
snare to entrap me. If I have secrets, I will
keep them."
Be he pushed the pen and paper from him,
and the night flowed slowly on. The candle on
the little pine table diinly burned, flashing and
falling with melancholy light.
A sudden vibration startled him. It came
from the floor under his feet. Presently a board
began to lift, rising gradually and noiselessly.
Ralph watched the phenomenonwith lively in-
terest. It portended,'something. What was it?
A human hand became visible, the board was
pushed entirely aside, and a head arose to view.
Girdwood sat fixed'and mute, staring in won-
der at this sub-munilane appearance. The face
turned silently toward him. As quickly as he
-oould, with his manacled hands, he seized the
light,'and held it downward ; and it threw its
pale rays on the features of Scotto, the Scout
The surprise of Ralph was complete. Of all
the faces he might have expected to see, Luke
Scotto's was not among them. Doubt, hope,
aid strong curiosity possessed him. He waited
for the key to this mystery, nor was he- kept
long in suspense.
The scout laid his finger on his lips, then, ele-
vating his arm, beckoned him to 'ollow. At
that moment, a scrap of paper fluttered to the

floor. Gird" ood eagerly' picked it up. Upon
it was wriitten, in iope's harndwi'iting
The cpuatrsig n, to-n'g/,t, is Richmond !"
He ianled it to Scotto, who nodded with a
satisfied air, and signified, by another and more
imperative motion, that he should immediately
lower himself through the opening. It was not
a time for questioning or explanation, and he
instantly obeyed the admonition. He found
himself stan~dinig on the firm earthen-floor of a.
4cllar. He would have taken the candle, but
the scout shook his ieid, and he left it burning.
Scotto then replaced the board, and] they were
in total darkness. Taking him by the arm, his
guide led him several paces, and presently he
saw the moonlight creeping through an opening
in the wall.
" Be quiet !" whispered Scotto; and, mount-
ing a box, looked out cautiously. ' When you
hear the sentinel say ' About.' be within reach of
me."
With these low-breathed instrucions, the
scout's body darkened the hole, and Ralph was
conscious, an inst-nt after, that he was lying in
the grass outside. He stepped upon the box,
his heart beating as he had never before known
it to beat. Just then, a sentinel said - About !"
A strong hand grasped his shoulder, and he
w.s dragged through the narrow outlet, and
pressed hard and prone to the earth. His emo-
tions were indescribable. le tried to bring
every muscle into subjection, and to hush his,
respiration.' Another life was staked, and for
him. The sentinel passed the corner of the
house, and for a moment was hidden from view.
The garden was a few yards distant, and in it
was a trellis, covered with vines. A gentle pull
admonished Ralph that the critical moment had
arrived. Scotto half arose, glided across the in-
tervening space, and sank down -behind the
trellis ; and the young main imitated his move-
ments with wonderful fidelity.
'An approving pressure signified the scout's
satisfaction.' They e lay there, entirely screened
by the foliage, till the sentinel passed and re-
turned again.
About ten yards from this .screen was some
shrubbery, and trees beyond. The distance be-
tween was rather open, but darkened by the
shadows of surrounding objects.
"Now !" whispered Scotto , and they ran this
dangerous gauntlet in safety, then crept away
among the oaks. All seemed to go well till
they came upon a figure lying upon the ground,
asleep, apparently.
Girdwood was'seized with apprehension ; but
Scotto advanced without fear, and the figure
cautiously arose. It was Dagon, to the un-
speakable relief of Ralph.
" Take off the ruffles !" said Scotto.  The
black applied a key, and relieved the young
t man of the handcuffs.-

The darkness that precedes the -dawn now lent
a deeper gloom to the swamp. The hum of the
Confederate camp had long since died away in
the distance.
Peleg and Pickering spread a couch of cedar
boughs, and Scotto and Girdwood stretched
their weary limbs upon it.
CHAPTER XiV.
IN THE sWAMP.
When Girdwood awoke, the sun had reached
the meridian. ie was surprised that his slum-
bers had been so profound and protracted, but
weariness and relief from anxietyhad contribut-
ed to 'his repose. The hound Jule was watch-
ing beside him; but Luke Scotto and the fight-
ing brothers were not to be seen. He wonder-
od at this desertion, and at first was inclined to
regard it as a breach of friendship; but re-
flection brought different feelings. He believed
that Scotto would return, and resolved to wait
a reasonable time for his appearance. He was
very thirsty, and searched for water.: Finding-
some dark, brackish pools in the swamp, he
drank from them, and the warm, thick fluid was
more grateful to his parched tongue than the
clearest water lie had ever tasted.
. Leaving the cedar jungle, he endeavored to
obtain a viewof the surrounding country, but
on account of its inequality, could see but lit-
tle. In a distant field, however, he discovered
what seemed to be a company of Confederate
skirnishers or scouts, and retreated to the
swamp, the cover of which lie- had scarcely
gained, when he had reason to congratulate
himself on his prudence, for a small body of
horse, a moment later, crossed the open space
space beyond.
Keeping the hound crouched beside him, he
observed the progress of the riders, who were
evidently a squad of the Black Cavalry, either
searching, for hiniself or reconnoitering. Thee
passed slowly by his li ing-place., The ground
being soft, the horses sank to -their fetloelks,
precluding the idea of speed. When directly
opposite, and within a dozen yards. of him, he
recognized, with a heart-throb of apprehension,
the stabuart proportions of Ceolneliurdle-
stone.
ie pressedathe delicate head of the dog to
the earth to prevent her from seeing her master
aid bounding after him, as she might be likely
to do.
"These escapes'have been very singular," he,
heard llunrdlestone remark.
.Secret enemies are the worst enemies." a
horseman, wear ng the bige of a lieutenant,
replied.'

"1 know of it secret enemies at the genera'a
head-quarters," returned the colonel.
"They may be in one's own household,""sd

haughtily, "the Confeder icy has no active

your insinuation with scorn, and its repetition
will call forth my-resentment."
" I meant no offence," responded Storrow, with
the same dissatisfied manner. "I but know th

and carrying 1 know not what important'infor-
matiop to tIe Union Army. Prisoners can't get
from under our very noses without help, especi-
ally when they are in irons and doubly guard-
ed."
" I like not your tone !" retorted IHurdlestone,
with displeasure. " I was made responsible for
their safe keeping, and these two escapes touch
mue more nearly than you or any other officer.
To the general-in-chief I am accountable, and to
no other."
"You know best, sir; but if I had my way,
there should be no more escapes between seir-
tence and the halter. I'd hang 'em right up,
sir-right up! - I had my suspicions of that oily
fellow, Girdwood, from the beginning. The bul-
let-hole through his cap didn't deceive me. I
wouldn't give that for his dispatches !" Storraw
snapped his thumb and finger contemptuously.
" But he's had a fine time among us," he Went
on, now addressing his conversation apparently
to a man on his left. "He has fared well and
fed well, And it is rumored that e has found
time to toy with the boy Cupid. If certain
parties do not belie him, lie has not tried his
arts of pleasing in vain."
" Forward !" cried the colonel, spurring his
horse anddashing on.
The horsemen ascended the ridge, and soon
disappeared on the other side. Girdwood was
infinitely relieved by their speedy Iassage from
sight. Going back to the spot where he' hraf
slept, lie awaited the return of the scout, soie-
times gazing up at the sky through the broad,
dark-green branches of the cedar interposed be-
tween himi and the hot rays of the sun likb a
sheltering hand, sometimes caressing the hound,
and always thinking of Hope Hurdlestone.
Preseintly he heard quick,"light steps in the
swamp, and' Scotto, long looked for, dame at
last.
"What news?" asked Girdwood, impatiently.
Just then heavy firing was heard iii. the diree-
tion of Manassas.
Hark!" said Scotto. "General Tyler has
waked up some rebel batteries, I reekin, down
to the Rui.",  -   .
"The attaek,.then, is premature V' exclaimed
Ralph.
" Th-y're itot gii' to attack in force to-day.


as          SCOTTO, THE SCOUT ; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.

They're makin' a strong reconnoisanee of the
enemy's position," replied the scout.
" Strong indeed, if one may judge by those
heavy, rapid discharges of cannon. I am fear-
ful that their patriotic ardor has outrun their
prudence, if 1 can judge correctly by-the sound
of the firing, nothing less than crushing brigades
should be thrown upon them at that point.
Single regiments will not do. See!1 Wreaths
of smoke are curling.up to the sky."
"'There'll be more smoke to-morrer. Our
army has passed Fairfax, and ndw rests at Cen-
treville, stretching to the right and left like bats'
r wings. To-morrer '11 be the 21st, an dSundav';
and a great battle will be fou't. God he only
knows what the result '1l be I"
" Disastrous,- I'm afraid. They don't know
what they're going to fight. There's a great
difference between meeting an enemy in open
AeId, and intrenched on ground of his own
choosing. Even undisciplined volunteers can
fight behind breastworks. Then they have the
ad vantage of knowing the country. There is
mot a cow-paths they are unacquainted with."'
" True !" responded Scotto. " But if our
boys were well commanded, I shouldn't have no
fear for the end on't."
" Av f There's the rub. Many of the Fed-
e+al oiffaers have never smelled gunpowder, ex-
oeot in woodcock and snipe-shooting, There's
a-vast difference between mustard-seed shot and
cannon balls. Let us hurry to -Centreville," an-
swered Girdwoods with earnestness._
" Be patient," said Scotto, coolly. " The
Black Calvary are out in every direction, and
wouldn'tt be pleasant to fall into their clutches.'
Ik the morning , airly, there'll be work in airnest.
It there's no accident, you'll hear the thunder of
cannon with the rising' of the sun, when, if you've
a-mind for sarvice, you can fall in with the Six-
-ninth, or the Fire Zarves, or whatsoever
iment you like. The Sixty-ninth, I've hear,
w il have the post of honor, and lead up to the,
batteries. Their time's out, and they can go
kme, every man of 'em ; but they ain't the
bey 'to show the white feather in sight of an
iaemy. I wish I could say as, much of the
Peans lvania Fourth, which, in the mornin', '1l
take the back track."
" Turn their backs on their brothers-in-arms?
Impossible I" exclaimed Girdwood.
" When the Sixty-ninth and other gallant
lads march to danger and, death, the Pennsyl-
vania Fourth will left foot, right foot, torards
safety and home."
Luke Scotto contracted his brows, and me-
ehanically tightened the belt around his loins.
"It pains me to hear it.' Every regiment will
be needed."
"Ay ! They might stay with the reserve
force, rather than turn back, if they don't keer
to snuff gunpowder. Howsomever, let 'em go.

They'll git a name oy it that nobody 'II covet.
What's into 'em, I wonder?"
"Not cowardice, I hope? Not want of patri-
otism, I trust ? Where ai-e. those singular
lads ?"'
" Couldn't keep 'em, ticeri'ore let 'em go.
They was off likesky-rockets soon as never they
heerd the big guns ; for there's been firin' at
odd jobs for a long spell. What day of the
month did I say it was ?"
" The 20th."
" Then the 21st of July will- be a day in our
history. Prehaps a dark, prehaps a bright one.
On the 21st, the star-spangled critters, if they
have a chance, will try tCoir steel on them as
have plunged this it I;i  poverty, distress,
and war. As for myse f. I 1eer nowhat for the
terrors of battle. I've fou't under Scott,\ in
Mexico. I've seen the old flag carried triumph-.
antly hundreds o' miles into the inemy's coun-
try. I've seen it wave over cities, and forts, and
bloody fields."
Scotto looked up, raised his right arm, ana
his face glowed with enthusiasm.
" They was the pride o' nations, the Stars- and
Stripes was ; they was the hope o' the misera-
ble and downtrodden everywhere . There's a
heavy account to reehin. We'll foot up the
whole on't presently. I said I didn't mind the
battle for my own sake. But there's young lads
in the army that ain't seasoned to the malan-
choly sights o' war. Their hearts '11 fly up into
their throats, at fust, but th'ey'li get used to it'
arter a little, go that they'll hack, hew, and slew
with the veterans. Many on'em won't go back,
in course not. Their bodies '11 enrich this sile,
but their names won't never die.'
Scotto, the scout, continued to gaze ak the
sky, and his brown face was calm and earnest.
" Even soI" responded Girdwood, impressive-
ly. And each felt that the morrow was big with
events.
-°CHAPTER XV.
AT MANASSAS.
With the first burst of artillery on the event-
ful morning of the 21st, Ralph Girdwood
sprang to his feet. The scout was already on
the alert.
"It's General Tyler's division," he said.
"They've hail a long march, and are directly
atween us and the inemy."S
"The guns speak loudly. They are much
nearer than I supposed. Now is our time," re-
sponded Ralph, eager for the affray.
" Stay  come'at!s  There's no hurry  yet.
You'll have enough on't afore night."
Girdwood looked at Scotto inquiringly, and
chafed at his inexplicable delay.
" Trust an old fighter, and don't fret," he
said, in reply to the young man's impatient,
glance.
The hound Jule arose from the foliage where

"Too late to think on't," added Scotto. "We
must fight it out." Then to his Rangers:
" Boys, stan' your ground and strike whenever
there's a chance. Cut, hack, and slew! Eat
your way into this p'ison rebellion. Let 'em
see what's into ye."-
At that moment Major Meagher was seen riding
to and fro on a spirited horse, waving his hat,
and cheering the Sixty-ninth to the onset.
Sherman's battery replied as well as it could to
the rebel fire, and the battle again became gen-
eral. Scotto, at the head of his command, rag-
ed to and fro, seeking in vain for the )Black
Horse Cavalry. ,
And thus the conflict went on. The sun went

Men fell down and died. without wounds, from
heat and thirst.
The enemy gave groun'd. slowly at first, but
yith a rout at last. The victors cheered, and
the wounded and dying lifted up their voices
with the rest. The word passed up and down the
lines that the day was won. Comrades in arms
shook hands and congratulated each other, and
weary officers talked of a victory. Every loyal
heart beat high. Soldiers forgot eight hours of
fighting and a harrassing march beneath sultry
skies, and tasted their reward in the triumph of

CHAPTER XVI.
rH3 BLACK HORSM CAVALRY.
While the troops stood panting and thirsting,
there eame an order to fall back. No one could
definitely trace the origin of the order, butfpuch
an order there appeared to be; and various regi-
ments that had been most 'hotly engaged, much
thinned and disorganized, made a retrograde
movement to the open fields. Much 'surprised,
Girdwood - and Scotto followed them. When
they reached the open space, they found the
Fire Zouaves already there, cool, collected, ,and
charheteristically unconcerned. They, with the
debris of other regiments, were retreating slow-
ly, without hurry or flurry, toward their camp
at Centreville.

Girdwood presently heard the words. "John-
ston ! Re-enforcements I" which ran from mouth
to mouth along the broken lines. Just then
clouds of dust wet-e seen; indicating a grand
flanking movement of the enemy. The troops
quickened their pace. Scotto rode among diem,
entreating them to form again and fling back
the foe ; but the worried tides of men and horses
rolled on. Anon there was a cry : " The Black
Horse I The Black Horse !"
The officers made a desperate effort to stay
the' reflex current ; they shouted, persuaded,
threatened. Scotto and Girdwood aided them
in this endeavor, and finally the Sixty-ninth, a
Wisconsin regiment,' and a portion of the F-e
Zouavet, forced to receive the chai-ge of the
Black Horse Cavalry.
Scotto and his Rangers drew up on the left,
glad of an opportunity to meet that redoubt-
able body of men. They came with thunder-
ous noise, the heavy tramp of six hundred horses
shaking the ground like an earthquake. They
came in their pride, and insolence, and contempt
of Northern courage. The clank and jangle of
their spurs and sabres were like the din of
workshops.
Foremost among those charging squadrons
Girdwood descried the grim and stalwart figure
of Hurdlestone, He was leading the onset, and
his voice rang out stern and clear.
Girdwood'thought of Hope, and an involun-
tary shiver went over him.
A terrible silence fell upon the devoted regi-
ments. Each mant grasped more firmly his
musket, and turned a face of iron resolution to
the rushing foe. The front rank sank u pon one
knee, and with those in the rear, formed a fear-
ful wall of glittering bayonets. Not a gun was
fired till the Black Horse rangers were within
twenty yards, then a sheet of flame met them
in the faces, and the head of the column stag-
gered and fell.
While dizzy and reeling with the first shock,
another destroying storm of lead was poured
upon them, and the next in order went down,
to embarrass and obstruct those behind.  -
For a few moments there was a continuous
and deadly hail of Minis balls. Proud steeds
fell by scores. There was a fl ightful mass of
men and horses struggling in the throes of
death.
"Come on 1" shouted Scotto ; and leaning for-
ward in his saddle, he led his men into the
floundering chaos of the nearly-annihilated
cavalry. 'The Zouaves, with loud yells, plung.
ed after them, and when they came ont 'of the
melee, their long sabre-bayonets were no longer
bright, and horse and rider, on that field, were
found thrust through and through, when the
dead were buried. ' Some of those dark-haired
steeds were ridden to Washington by the lads
of the Eleventh.

on his black horse, and said, with habitual brev-

"Look 'e hyar!"
They had reached the farmhouse, and Zadoe's
adjuration referred to it.  But how different
was its appearance from  a former occasion !
There were ragged rents in the roof, and the,
walls were driven out and shattered by shells.
There .were many bloody signs of a struggle
around it.  Several Confederate and a few
Union soldiers lay stiff and motionless on the
ground.
Throwing his rein over a post, Girdwood
sprang from the saddle and across the now-ap-
parently deserted threshold.  There was no
sign of life within. The floorsawere splintered
by explodi!tg missiles, and dirt from the cellar
beneath w:es east to the very roof-tree.
"4Miss i irllestone I  Miss Hurdlestonet!
Hope! !Iop" !" cried Girdwood.
A wounded I man, in, a corner, opened his
ayes langu ily. It was a Federal officer.,
" How goes the battle ?" he asked in a faint
mice.,
"Lost! lost!  Johnston, without striking a
blow, has rolled back the tides of victory. Our
weary columns are retreating,"     -
'ito officer groaned, and said no more. He

asked for neither water nor help. His reeling
faculties were grappling with the terrible truth
he had heard.
" Hope! Hope !" repeated Ralpa.
No voice responded to the name. He ran
from room to room. Signs of the sad desolation
of war met him at every step. I lis search was un-
successful. When he returned, Zadoc Murelh was
holding a vessel of water to the wounded officer's
lips. He was forcibly struck with this instance
of the rough man's kindness. While he contem.
plated tim with surprise, he j-ut down the ves-
sel, adjusted the officer in a more comfortable
position, then turning to Girdwood, said:
" She isn't hyar. Come along !"
Leaving the shattered house, they mounted
their horse, and Murch ook the lea,l. As tie
were passing some negro huts, Dagon appeared ,
but in a notable state of despondnety. he was
amazed:at seeing Ralph.

" I's heerd a leap bout de Nerf o dr," said
Dagon, "and I should like mjghty well to '.O

"It is best seen in the night," replied Ralph.
"It's not the star of Dixie."
" Don' know 'bout that, mas'r.. There's many
eyes down in Dixie as would be proper glad to
git a glimpse of dat yer star. Lots o' contra-
ban's has struck out for it right through swamps,
alligator bayous, across rivers, and through
much tribulation.""
"You jest let the North Star alone, boy!i" in-
terposed Zadoe. " You've got a flat foot, a flat
nose, a flat forehead, thick lips, long hands, and
ha'r that is wool. You belong, I allow, to a flat
race; and the best thing you can do is, to be
happy with, hard work and enough to eat' and
drink. What you want o' liberty-eh? Wouldn't
know what to do with it if you hadtever so much
don't. Wish you's all back ag'in whar youcome
from ! You've jest fixed the Southerners, you

selves, nor let other white folks work.  But
come on if you want to. 1I don't keer ouch if
you run -right among the 'bolitionistsand git
into all kinds o' trouble. Be gladto git back
ag'in, I guess, if you once cross the Potomac.
If 1's your master, I wouldn't have ye, if ye
come back never so humble and whimperin'.'
Zadoc threw an inquiring look upward through
the branches of the trees at the smoky sky, and
.quickened his pace. Night was drawing on;
,but the sounds of strife had not ceased; they
reached the earn of the fugitives from various=
quarters. The boom of cannon and the burst-
ing of shells were.ever and anon audible.
Zadoe bore away across the country, keeping
in the. woods as much as possible, and avoiding
the open fields. They had not proceeded far
in this manner, when they found themselves
near, the skirmishers of Johnston's flanking
column, and were obliged to pause in - their,
flight.-
Squads of the Black Horse Cavalry which
had not yet been in action, were seen hurry-
ing toward Centreville. Their position was now
extremely precarious. Thsey could neither tu'n
back nor go forward.   Girdwood looked at
Zadoc with painful'perplexity. .
"Our embarrassment," lie rNnarked, "in-
creases at every step."
If you'll leave the gal, you can git out o'

this hyar," answered Zadoe,- glancing queerly
at Hope.
"Itis not to be thought of!" returned Gird-
wood, quickly and curtly.
"You see, squire, that men-critters can go
where women-eritters can't, on account 9 their
clothes and their daintiness.' Gal's flesh is as
tender as a young partridge. The brush and
bushes of swamps and wools tears their plum.
age to bits in scurcely no time."
" Whatever comes of it, I remain with Miss
Hurdlestone," said Ralph, firmly.
"Save yourself!" exclaimed Hope. "My
arigcr is' not comparable to yours. As the
daughteg of Colonel TIlurdlestone, ,I am  safe
.With the Coifederates ; although I confess it
will be a severe disappointment f I cannot join
my father, and lighten his captivity. by my
presence. Reflect, Mr. Girdi'ood, on the fait
your re-ci'ture involves."
Miss llurdlestone spoke with much animaa-
tion.
" I shall not desert you while thought worthy
by you to be trusted with the care of your per-
son."  Then to Zadoc:-. "Come, Mr. Morch,
secure us a present hiding-place. Sur ly you
arek acquainted with this portion of the coua-
try."
"Look 'e hyar ! Keep that pup in, Dragon !"
said Zadoe, with a warning motion to Dagon.
"Can't have that pup seoutin' aroun'. Keep
her clost under your nose, or you'll never see
the North Star till your ha'r is whiter nor your
ivories. Come on,- white folks ! I'm a strong

Murcli seemed infinitely relieved by this out.
burst, and turned' his horse's head toward the
darkest recesses of the forest, while the Confed-
erates were heard sweeping through the glades
on eitherside. Advancing to where the trees
stood more closely, and the foliage was more
eonipact, he dismounted and led his dark and
glossy steed by the bridle.
" Softly, youngster, softly !" admonished Za-
doe. "Pay a leetle attention to your stepping'
as well as to. the, gal. Dry sticks '11 break, if
you tread on 'em rough."
Girdwood blushed consciously, while Hope
smiled at the quaintness of their guide.
It now grew suddenly dark. They had enter-
ed a swampy dingle so,dense with folliage, that
it well nigh shut out the light of day. Even
this secluded spot had been visited by destrue
tive missiles, for the young man stumbled over
a round shot, and anon tripped on a fragment
of shell.

" I am sure, Mr. Girdwood, that the clouds
swing less heavily to and fro. Do you not see
the wefts of siver ining  ' murmured Hope,
softly.
" May I interpret the metaphor as my heart
dictates ?' cried Ralph, capturing a lighter
hand than he had taat d.iy encountered in the
field. " Not the thought of personal danger ,
,,ot the war itself, wouid abate my joy, if one
siuort word by your :ips were spoken."
'-u- ir aq1iutanee is brief. Ask not too
uie. Turn your eves upward, Mr. Girdwood.
See the light steal through the narrow rifts! Is
it not a promise of future brightness ?"
Hope's voice was low and gentle. Her eyes,
which were upturned a moment, fell modestly
beneath the drooping lashes. ,
Girdwood pressed the imprisoned hand to his
lips. His blood was in a pleasing commotion.
H is pleasure was equaled only by his gratitude.
He dared not trust himself to believe too much,
or to give an overwrought coloring to her sim-
ple words.
"It is the fault of man to be too sanguine,"
be saL, when calm enough to speak with com-
p -suoe. "I will endeavor to bear your over-
w:teliming kindness with humility."
"' Speak not of humility ! I am but dust and
ashes. In this world, words are of little worth.
Be reasonable. Hope not too much; for the
exigencies of the times are such, that every-
tuing relating to us is involved in uncertainty.
Even our friendship may be rent 'sunder by the
terrible vicissitudes of war. Think of my
father !"
" He stands between us, angry and stern !"
exclaimed Girdwood. "But the war must some-
tune end. The rancor of political feuds may
not embitter his after-life. The restored Union
and peace may soften his prejudices and temper
his hatred."
" Believe it not ! Believe it not I" cried a
voice, that made Girdwood and Hope spring to
teeir feet. The grim and powerful figure of
Colonel Hudlestone loomed before them.
"Mv father!" exclaimed Hope, rimning to-
vurdh inm, with outstretched hands. Hurdle-
w 'zi-' r'oljulsed her moodily.

rutrted, slaking her off, for she had laid a gen-
Lie rand on his shoulder.
--Call it what you will ; I will not gainsay.
But I think I know how it will end."

Hurdlestone turned slowly upon Girdwood.
" So, sir I" he began. "This is the way you
protect my daughter. This comes of your umag-
nanimity in seeking her after the battle."
"Your reproaehes, sir, have some point of
justice ; yet I swear to you ,that what I have
said was upremeditated," answered Ralph.
" Unpremeditated !" sneered  the colonel.
"The worst of criminals might- plead that ex-
cuse in extenuation of crime. It was for this
you sought my daughter, and decoyed her foot-
steps hither !"
" Colonel Hurdlestone, I must beg of you to
use no language that a man of honor may not
hear without offence," returned Ralph, with
dignity. "If Miss Hurdlestone has received a
disrespectful word or look from me, I will not
evade the responsibility, but hold myself ac-
countable for the same."
" Most kind ! Most considerate I" murmured
Hope.
" Too kind-too considerate !" vociferated the
colonel. "It is this kindness and consideration,
as you daintily term it, that I complain of. A
fine time, girl, for love-making, when your father
ws a prisoner, and your native soil overraun
with Federal hireling-hordes!"
" While regretting and deprecating your an-
ger, I rejoice at your escape," observed Gird-
wood.
" Young nnan, the best advice I can give you
is, to follow the retreating rabble of the Wash-
ington Army. As for my daughter, the pater-
nal aim, I trust, will be found sufficient to pro.
tect her. Be wise, and return no more to Ma-
nassas. Should you unhappily disregard this
injunction, the reward you have earned will be
rigorously meted out to you. I go to join my
friends of the victorious army. Come, girl--
minion-ingrate ! Follow me p'"
.Hurdlestone looked at his daughter as if he
expected and exacted obedience.
Girdwood stoodconfounded and wondering.
The man whom he had believed a prisoner
on his way to Arlington was before him, to
dampen the first glow of his feelings, rob him
of Hope, and baffle his plan. An emotion of
rushing disappointment came upon him. The
light no longer crept through the drift of smoky
clouds. Darkness rolled in upon the dingle.
The metaphor of Hope had, apparently, lost its
meaning. The silver lining had departed.
CHAPTER XX.
LOO    'E HitAR!
The dark-green leaves fluttered and rustled in
the stillness. A puff of hot and stifling air swept
down from the b tattle-field. For a moment it
seemed to Girdwood that the earth was reeling
under his feet.
" Follow m !" repeated the colonel. " As for
you, sir," he added, with a stern glance at Ralph.

as for you, sir, misguided young man, escape
while you may."
He turned slowly to go, and Hope made a
step forward.
"Look 'c hyar !"
The parties started, as if simultaneously
thrilled by a shock of magnetism. Moving
from beneath the foliage that drooped over the
camp, the short, stout personality of Zadoo
Murch advanced quietly and laid his hand on
Hurdlestone's shoulder.
"Look 'e hyar !"
Never before had Girdwood heard this singu-
lar man throw so much meaning into these
words.-
" You here !" exclaimed the colonel.'
" I'm hyar !" said Murch, gruffly.
" Well ?" queried Hurdlestone, curtly.
" I allow that you're a prisoner," said Mureb,
ungraciously.
" Not long since I was a prisoner, but now I
am free," answered the colonel, with a flush o
pride and conscious strength.
"Did ye give your peril of honor ?" asked
Zadoc, with increasing amoiguity of manner.
" Not I! I gave a few lusty blows and the
spurs to, niy horse and you see me here," re-
sponded Hurdlestone, who prided himself on his
prowess. " Hope, take moy arm," he added.
" You're hyar, but not free," continued
Murch.
" What do you mean, sir?" cried Hurdlestone,
angrily. "I don't comprehend your bearing,
sir."
There was a stir of feet on the dry leaves.
Hurdlestone felt himself seized by the'legs and
shoulders. He shook himself like a rampant
horse, but without freeing himself from his un-
expected assailants.
Girdwood, who perceived the true condition of
affairs, saw the fighting brothers clinging about
thencolonel's nether limbs, like young anacondas,
and Corporal Keith clutching him firmly by
the collar.
Luke Scotto walked composedly from among
the trees into the foreground.
" This hyar is my meanin'," said Murch.
"Traitor!" hissed Hurdlestone.
" I'm the extract of sev'ril States," quoth Za-
doe, "and a strong tea for some kinds o' sick-
ness. Call me what you will."
" Give us the slip, didn't ye, colonel?" said
Scotto. "Co'p'ril Keith, you ain't the man I
took ye to be."
"As we's ridin' along," answered the corporal,
" the twins clinched, and I went to separate
'em. While I was a uutwistin''em, the prisoner
rode down and knocked down the guard, and
streaked it. I cut arter him, and here he is." ~-
" Stop shakin' him ! What's into ye, co'p'ril?
You've got him, theerfore be quiet. Colonel,
don't be rampageous. Submit like a man. The
thing's agin ye, and you can't help it. There's

a squad o' the star-spangled er'tters within call,"
said the scout, with that easy self-composure
that characterized-him.
" You speak truly," responded Hurdlestone,
with gloomy grandeur. "Fate orders it. CUil
off these curs, and I give you my word that I
will make no attempt to escape, unless rescued
by my friends."
"You do well," returned the scout. " Your
word is taken, although- one who has proved
false to the flag mayn't be fully trusted. Doe t
flush up, colonel, for I say it, as 'twere, in sor-
row."
," You know the fortunes of the day, I sup
pose ?" interrogated the prisoner, with a smile
that could not be mistaken.
" Repulsed, but not beaten. It brings you no
nearer the eend, and only lengthens the war.
Your masked battery, login victory, avails n-
what, for 'tisn't follered up by Beauregard. Our
troops '11 reach their old campin'-ground in safe-
ty ; and carter this the army '11 be made over:id
perpar d to put down this p'ison rebellion. TIs
'Il wake up and open the eyes of Gover'nweiit
and People."
The righteousness and greatness of hiseaiuse
shed a notable dignity over the features of Luke
Scotto. Ilurdlcstone looked at him and in\ol-
untarily sighed. Possibly a thought of Wash-
ing~tn, the Revolution, and the heritage of fre-
dom, left a mournful, regretful track along toe
road of memory.
"Had you brought the whole North down to
Manassas," he said, presently, with an obvious
effort to shake off his depression, " we shom d
have whipped you."
" You bought, and then ag'in you moughtn't:"
returned Scotto, with composure. " Let s be
movin'," he added, "for the remnant of the
Black Boss is ragin' up and down, s'archin' f r
them as is -unfort'nately cut off fropAWe maia
body of our trops."o                  m
" Where's that trai' or and villain ?" asked
Hurdlestone, glancing about. for Mureb. But
Zadoc had mysteriously disappeared. and the
colonel was left in doubt respecting his charae-
ter.
The parties followed Scotto a few rods, and
found, farther up in the dingle, a dozen of the
Independent Rangers waiting the coning of
their leader.
CHAPTER XXI.
SCOTTO AND THE REnEL LEADER.
"Well, captain, what's to be done ?" asked
one of the men. " The rebels seem to be pre ty
plenty hereabouts. I can hear them stirring on
both sides of us."
" Dismount, lads, and let your h rses bre the
some'at, and wherever you see a bunch o',grass,
let the poor critters have it. It may be   ut ,t
to stay awhile where we are. Artr -I've t am

look favorable. With women folks along "-he
looked at Hope-"'twould be foolish to show
ourselves unnecessarily to the rebels."
66I know," he went on, reflectively, " that we
might hack, hew, and slew, peradventur'," but
the dainty body of the young woman ain't bul-
.t-proof; theerfore we must conduct ourselves
oeorlin'."
"Let me refresh your memory," said Hurdle-
stone to the scout, as he was moving away.
"If there is an attempt at rescue by my com-
panion--in-arms, I shall not remain passive."
"1I understand , sir," returned Scotto, coldly.
" In that event, your word isn't pledged to stay
with us any longer nor we can keep ye. South-
ern honor mustn't be tarnished, I reckin I"
Luke Scotto shrugged his shoulders, and there
was, a quiet sarcasm in his voice that was suf-
filecntly obvious. Then to his followers:
"Men, take good care of the prisoner." With
this parting -injunction Scotto walked away, and
was soon hidden from view by the trees. He
passed from the dingle on that side commanding
the best view of the battle-field. Climbing a
sharp eminence, be strained his eyes in the di-
rection of Centreville and -Warrenton Road.
But the shadows of evening lay like a dim man-
tte over the scene. Here and there lights were
flashing, like faint and erratiemeteors. Already
had anxious friends gone forth to search for fa-
miliar faces among the dead and wounded. It
was the old, sad, and often-enacted afterpiece of
battles. He could hear the sound of hurrying
feet, as squads of horsemen swept to and fro
from various quarters. Beneath the hazy cano-
py, scarcely distinguishable from other objects,
lie caught phantom glimpses of fragments of in-
fantry, flitting and fluctuating like the billows
of a disturbed sea. Borne on the passing breeze,
the low and melancholy wail of the wounded came
to his ears. He had heard that mournful music
before. He had grown acquainted with it in
bloody raids of the border, and on the red fields
of Mexico.
" They wanted war," said Luke, speaking
aloud, " and they've got it. We've got the
worst on't this time, but the next time the Union
banners move toward Manassas, they won't float
over an armed mob."
The sharp' clang of iron hoofs startled Scotto,
and out short his soliloquy. A horseman spur-
red up the ascent. Scotto prudently stepped
behind a sturdy oak, while the headlong rider,
reaching the summit of the eminence, paused to
breathe his panting steed. Giving a slack rein
to the reeking animal, the rider endeavored to,
separate the realities before him from the pre-
vailing shadows. He seemed exultant, yet
doubtful and perplexed.
"They'll make a stand at Centreville," he
muttered. "Surely, they don't mean to run to
Washington. This must he a ruse to draw us
on. Johnston hesitates. He fears to hurl his

forces against them. Accursed darkness that
covers both friend and foe !"
The horseman bent over his horse's mane,
and looked with the utmost intensity. He saw
the same objects that Scotto had seen, but with
far different feelings.
"Victory! victory !" he added. "The old
flag flies! My name shall live in history. Be'
fore me are power and dominion ! The Great
Republic is dead !"
" Touton Beauregard !" said a stern yet steady
voice.
The horseman gathered up the flowing rein
and turned quickly toward the person who had
thus addressed him. He beheld Luke Scotto,
with the barrel of his cocked rifle resting in the
hollow of his left arm. The sight, for a mo-
ment, paralyzed him. He knew well the man ;
his integrity ; his - stern patriotism ; the iron
rigidness of his resolves, when once formed
The triumph of Manassas, the glory of the
hour, .faded away.  The fresh laurels on his
brow withered as by the blighting touch of
lightning.
"Touton Beauregard !"
The tones of the scout thrilled to the marrow
of his bones.
" Luke Scotto !" faltered the victorious gen-
eral.
" How good is yonr memory !" said Luke,
with ominous sang froid. "If you hadn't seen
me, you wouldn't knowed me, I reeko. This
isn't like Mexico-is it ? We didn't see no flag
with seven stars on't down there !"
The Confederate officer sat silent in the sad-
dle, gazing vacantly at Scotto.
"'Tisn't long since you had me at your head-
quarters, with your secesh rabble around me,
talkin' of halters and spies. My life seemed as
nowhat in your eyes. I was a Northern mud-
sill, to hang atween the heavens and the airth
Now I have you, traitor ! This weepon 'that's
leveled on ye, has brought down a man at eigh-
ty rods, and, can do the same at a hundred.
The muzzle, as I hold the thing careless in my
hand, covers your heart. Why should I spare
you, Touton Beauregard ?"
He paused, standing stiff and stirless as iron.
"The world would be better for't," he went
on. " No true man would weep, but for your
sins. In time to come, when this twenty-first
day of July hes passed into history, some at
like this mought be found in the record: 'Beau-
regard, the rebel general, was shot the evening'
arter the battle by Luke Scotto- . man wo
sarved his country acordin' to his abilities,
without hope of fee or rewirl. His friends
buried him in the night, and the grave of the
traitor is unknown and unmarked by stone or
tributetof affection.'"
A breathless silence followed. The distant
occasional firing rendered it more impressive.

The general's stunned faculties began slowly to
react. His blood flowed and glowed again.
"It is not my destiny 1" he said, somewhat
hoarsely.
"You're the Napoleon of the South, I s'pose,
theerfore have a star? Don't be misled by
stars, Touton. There's but one star worth the
nindin', and that's the star of honor. I've
heerdof the North Star; but who ever heerd
of the South Star ?" answered Scotto, his rifle
still turned upon the chieftain.
" The Southern Star," returned Beauregard,
" is the star of empire."
"And it rolls torards the- Gulf!" retorted
Luke, with dignity. "It rolls not West'ard nor
North'ard. Not by no means! The light of
your star will be quenched in the waters of the
Gulf o' Mexico."
" The fanaticism of the North !" sneered
Beauregard, whose only hope was to engage the
scout in conversation, and watch for the favor-
able moment of escape. He had reason to be-
lieve that his friends were not far distant. They,
might come up; his stern captor might be
thrown off his guard, or something to his ad-
vantage might in some way happen. He did
not abandon hope. He would not and could not
perish without tasting the fruits of victory. He
-wanted to hear a gaping multitude cry : "There
goes the man who defeated the Union Army !"
" Fanaticism and zeal are much alike, I allow,"
said Scotto. "Without zeal, a man's nowhat.
There's nothing' into him to give him energy.
But I'll preach you a sarmon at another time ;
theerfore, git off that hoss. A prisoner a hoss-
back is a prisoner with the advantage of four
hoss legs to two man legs."
"Luke Scotto," answered Beauregard, with
earnestness, "hear me ! As you value rank,
and riches, and a name, hear me !" -
"Go on, Touton ! Go on, for half a minute,"
responded Scotto, still standing firm and straight
and unbending in his simple integrity.
" Go with me, Luke Scotto. Yield your ad-
vantage. Trust your future fortunes in my
hands."
He spoke rapidly and with emphasis.
"To what end ?" asked Luke.
" To the end of riches and rank. Look at
me ! I am fresh from the battle-field. I am
flushed with my first great victory !" -
The voice of the rebel chief might have mov-
ed one whose loyalty was less.
"If you was flushed with a thousand victor-
les, 'twould be the same !" replied Luke, with-
out the slightest sign of relenting.
" To go with-you, is to go to the halter,",con-
tinued Beauregard. "A prisoner to t'he Fed.
erals I will never be. A rifle-ball would be far
more friendly and welcome than such a fate.
No! no! that may never be. As I said, you
have me at an advantage ; but tell me the price
of this advantage, and I give you my word of

honor as a man and a soldier, that it shall be
paid to the last farthing."
" Tempt me not ! Tempt me not, for I bear
you no good will," answered Scotto. ",Give
me all the Confederate bonds, all the Confeder-
ate cotton, all the Confederate niggers, and all
the Confederate gold, and I wouldn't let you go
of my own will!"
The scout, in the pale moonlight, looked
really sublime. His rude eloquence smote the
heart of Beauregard more than the sound of
the Federal cannon he had heard that day. His
brave words gave manhood and beauty to his
character.
"I believe in my destiny !" muttered Beaure-
gard, watching the dark barrel of the rifle, re-
solved to strike the spurs deeply into his horse
and dare the menacing bullet. Had any other
hand held the weapon, his fears for the result
would have been infinitely less ; but the quick
eye, steady arm, and sure finger of the scout,
rendered the trial no ordina-y risk. He was
about to lance the reeking. sides of the animal,

"Nay, but the rascal would have shut me 1"
remonstrated the general, provoked at the in-
terference.
" Look 'e hyar !" retorted Murch. "I saved

her way back ; but when she had walked a half-
hour, she was surprised that she had not accom-
plished her purpose. She kept on, till the con.
viction that she had lost her way'stole gradually
upon her.
When she emerged from the woods, it was a
place unknown to her, but a portion of the thea-
tre of the day's events, for it was marked by the
red track of battle. She believed that she was
far from the farm-house, and was surprised at
the long stretch of ground that had been occu-
pied by the hostile armies.
Treading with timid steps, she passed many
mementoes of the fight. She thought she had
not courage to look upon the victims of war ;
but when she saw the motionless sleepers, it
was with more of solemnity than fear. It was
not without feelings of patriotic sublimity that'
she saw the Union dead in their last, quiet slum-
bers. She reflected that they had fallen- in a
good cause, and that the private who had yield-
ed his life for the beloved flag was as much a
hero as the gallant officer who had died, sword
in hand, at the head of his column.
Such sensations and deductions were whole-
some ; they disarmed her foolish, selfish terrors,
and directed her mind to higher moral lessons
and nobler objects.
The pale and eternal orbs of heaven poured
down upon her innocent and undefended head a
pure atmosphere of mild and softened light-a
snowy illumination that also fell upon the white
faces-of the slain. Federal and Confederate lay
side by side. Mothers and wives would ev cep
over both. Liberty and Slavery had its martyrs
there. The God of Battles sat in His majesty

CHAPTER XXIII.
THE VITANDIERE.
Hope moved on. She knew that she was
astray, but she felt protected and guided. A
low sobbing reached her ears. It did not startle
her much ; she was expecting sounds of grief
and pain ; it was the place and the hour for
them. Looking onward, she beheld a figure
seated beside a heap of slain men. It was a fe-
male form, and the presence of the dead gave.
her a peculiar sanctity in the eyes of Hope, who
approached her without hesitation.
She was a young woman of eighteen or twen-
ty years, with a pretty, childish face, and clad
in the picturesque costume of a French vivan-
diere.
Miss Hurdlestone's light step at once drew her
attention. She arose quickly, and the former
perceived that she held a pistol in one of her
small hands. Seeing that it was one of her own
sex who had disturbed her sad and solitary vigil,
she manifested both surprise and pleasure, and
returned the dangerous little weapon to its
pocket.

" You followed the Federal Army ?" said
Hope, affected almost to tears.'
" I wear the red, white, and blue !" answered
the vivandiere, in a melancholy voice.
Hope now observed that her cassock or frock'
was made of those united colors.
" Why do you weep?" Hope asked.
The vivandiere looked at her inquiringly.
" Why do you ask such a question ?" she re-
plied, throwing a mournful glance over the
field. " You, who are a woman, young, and
with a heart in your bosom, should know. Truo
men lie here, unburied, slain by their brethren I
Who can refrain from weeping? It'has been a
dreadful day, miss !"
" Terrible, indeed !" sighed Hope. "I trem
ble at the thought of the dangers to which you
have been exposed, and I shudder at every-
thing around me. My good girl, you should
have kept out of the red circle of battle."
Hope advanced and took the passive hand of
the vivandiere, whose fair face expressed both
sorrow and courage
" Think of the poor soldiers," murmured tho
girl, " fainting with heat and thirst ! Think of
the wounded, too, dying for water ! Is it not a
work of duty, as well as mercy, to place the
drinking-cup to their hot lips ?" The vivan-
diere touched the canteen that hung at her side.
Her cheeks glowed with soft melancholy.
The silvery moonlight, falling on her young
face, seemed like a halo from heaven.
"I have received the ' God bless you !' of
many a brave soldier to-day," she added. . "I
never shall forget what I have seen and heard.
Some of the water-carriers have been shot by
the enemy. That was cruel; for civilized men
do not fire at women. You found me weeping,
because it is a day of disaster. A dearly-bought
victory was strangely lost. Cameron, and many
gallant officers and men, lie dead. I cry with
grief and anger!"
"Tears, my'girl, will not recall them," said
Hope, soothingly.
" You have questioned me ; now let me ques-
tion you," responded the girl, beginning to ex-
amine Hope with more interest. "You, too, are
young," she went on ; "as young as I, for my
half-masculine dress makes me look more youth-
ful than I am. Why, then, are you here ? Are
you loyal ?"
" As yourself, young woman !"
" That gives me joy ! It is pleasant to see a
loyal face in a scene like this: Perhaps -you
have come to look for a brother or lover ?"
" Neither, neither I" answered Hope, quickly.
" My father is a rebel officer. He led the Black
Horse wherever the battle raged."
"Then you may look for his body away yon-
der, for I know well the spot where the Black
Cavalry were cut to pieces. Come, my friend,
I will go with you, if.you wish. I have pity for
all."

T'


SCOTTO, TIIE SCOUT; OR, TIE UNION RANGERS.

The vivandiere pressed Hope's hand affection-
ately.
" I thank you, but there is no need. My fatli-
or lives. Let us leave this sad place. Tell.me
your name."
" Margaret Moore. They call me Maggie. I
followed the Seventy-ninth. But when I found
one moaning for water, I did not ask to what
regiment he belonged, or whether he were friend
or foe. More than one rebel has drank from my
canteen," replied the vivandiere.
" I doubt it not, my friend.' Loyal hearts are
ever merciful. I am sure we understand each
other. Let us be friends. My name is Hope
Hurdlestone."
" The daughter of Colonel Hurdlestone !" ex-
claimed Margaret. "lHe fought bravely. Isaw
him sweeping to and fro, with empty saddles at
his right and left. Those who came out alive
from the last charge upon the three regiments
will have a story to tell."
" Speak not of it! Let us somewhere seek
shelter and safety. I left friendsnot long ago,
but fear that I cannot again find them. You can
do no good here, and remaining may expose you
to new dangers ; for victory makes bad men
brutal."
"It you go toward Manassas, no; if toward
the Potomac, or iii any direction where we shall
be likely to fall in with Union troops, I will go
with you gladly," answered Maggie Moore.
" There is one," said Hope, with heightened
color, " whom I would find, who is no traitor,
but whom I left in great danger. I anymin doubt
whither to direct my footsteps ; but yonder, I
think, should be my way. I have been gently
reared, my slightest wish being anticipated and
obeyed by willing slaves'; and t4 e vicissitudes
of this day have been alike new and strange.
But I ought not to murmur, when so many lose
life itself for that cause which costs me but fa-
tigue and a silly girPs terrors. Your courage
arid devotion justly rebuke me."
" Your words are very sweet, dear young a-
(1y. Maggie Moore fears not toigo with you.
Look at this little instrument."
. The pretty vivandiere held up her pistol. It
was an improved and beautiful pattern, with
seven revolving cylinders.
- " I can use it well, Miss Hurdlestone. I will
not tell you what it has done to-day ; but all
things are lawful in self-defence. Look at this
small copper canister. It is the load. I thrust
it into the empty cylinders in a moment. See
how I do it.  'here ! the pistolis loaded. Now
that holds seven lives, if well aimed. It requires
a steady hand, though. Isn't my hand steady?2
Observe me, Miss Hurdlestone."
While speaking, Margaret Moore loaded the
empty cylinders with the percussion canisters
and to prove the firmness of her nerves, held out
her arm  and leveled   e pistol as deftly and
steadily as a veteran.

" So you need not be afraid, Miss Hope. For
one or two enemies, you see, I am quite prepar-
ed. It's a good thing to know how to defend
one's-self. You'might as well be a rag-baby, or
a log of wood, as not to have the knowledge and
courage to take care of your person. The
meanest thing that crawls has the instinct to
turn on what turns on it. Non-resistance, among
brutes, is foolishness."   1
" Very good and very true, to my simple ap-
prehension," responded hope, surprised at the
philosophy and self-possession of the vivandiere.
Margaret had returned the pistol to its ap-
propriate pocket, and they were mving away,-
mutually pleased with each other, when Hoe
discovered two men approaching, whose lawless
bearing filled her with alarm. They were dress-
ed in the dingy gray of the Confederate Army,
but the original color was nearly lost in dirt and
tatters ; a fact which the fitful moonlight was
sufficient to reveal. Their faces were unshorn,
and blotched with red, and (so far as Hope could
judge, on their nearer approach) bloated with
whisky, and the indices of all that was coarse
and revolting in the human character.
Such were the observations of Hope as the
men' advanced and confronted them. However
wanting in tidiness, they had no lack ot arms-
their leathern belts being literally crowded with
weapons that they had manifestly taken from
the slain and wounded. Each stood in a circle
of steel made up of pistols and lowie-knives,
thrust into their belts promiscuously, as gath-
ered from the field.
The 'discovery of Hope and Margaret gave
them the greatest satisfaction. They leered at
each other with a species of frightful faeetious-
ness that struck terror to the hearts of the trem:t
bling girls.
"I say, Peterson' said one.
The other, for a suitable response, ducked hs
head, put a tawny hand over his mouth. and
kicked out behind him with his right foot. This
pantomime was intended to express something
too good to be believed, and to which words
were inadequate.
" Peterson !" the fellow repeated.
"Go 'long !" said Peterson, now kicking at
his comrade in bear-like playfulness.  " Go
'long, sweetmeats ! -What's this here ? Don't
be afeard, little dears. Don't be an artomt
afeard. We a'n't grizzly b ars, I allt'w."
Peterson doffed an old fatigue-cap, and made
a grotesque bow to Hope and Margaret.
" Hang me, old boy, if these a'nt some o' the,
Federal gals as have come down yer with the
army ! This is what I calls a circumstance. I
sort of fancies this one in the long clothes.
She's a reg'lar good-looker!''
Haskins expressed his admiration by adlvane-
in, a step, and staring and grinning in Hope's
face.

an oak glade, and were glad to sink upon the
grass to rest.  -
Casting their eyes upward through the long
and'thread-like vista formed by the trees, that
stood like sentinels on either side, they beheld
the mystic stars, and the mild moon, staggering
faintly on its ethereal way. To Hope, the gen-
tle orb seemed to shudder at the deeds of men,
and hurried on its course, pale and sorrowing.
She thought of her fattier and her lover.
She wondered how it fared with them, and tried
to feel that they were safe. A distant rustling
of leaves reached her now too-vigilant ears.
Her companion heard the same, but with less
alarm, and attributed it to the playful leaps of
the ever--restless squirrel. The sounds, howev-
er, drew nearer, and became more distimet.
" It's a beast of prey !" said Miss Hurdle-
stone, in a suppressed voice. " I can hear its
long, light bounds."
o  It sounds like the running of a strong and
agile animal, I confess,'' answered Margaret ;
"but it may prove tobe a harmless rabbit, or
some poor opossum on a nocturnal ramble."
'- I fear it may be something of a fiercer sort,"
continued Hope. " It would be so dreadful to
be torn ii pieces by a stealthy catamount or
prowling wolf ."
The animal, whatever it was, whose tread dis-
turbed them, occasionally paused, then advanc-
ed with greater speed. ,lioth the young women
were now thoroughly frightened. The creature
was fearfully near. Its bounds were rapidly de-
vouring the ground. It reached the glade ; it
came down it like an arrow, straight toward
them. The vivandiere drew her little pistol, and
Hope covered her face. A half-dozen quick
bounds, and the fleet-limbed animal was upon
them. Hope expected to feel its hot fangs in
her flesh, instead of whmichl two soft paws were
laid upon her, and the cold nose of the hound
Jule was pressed against; her cheek.
"Oh " exclaimed Margaret, "it's nothing
but a dog ! And it must be yours, for it seems
to know you."
Hope smiled faintly, and showed to Margaret
a very pale face. She returned the joyful ea-
resses of the hound with genuine pleasure.
"Jule! Good Jule ! I'm glad to see you,
Jule !" she said. " Where liave you been ?
Why didn't you stay with me ?''
Jule wagged her tail and frisked about.
" Ai!" added her mistress. "If this crea-
ture could speak, what news it might tell me.!
Perhaps Dagon is seeking me !"
"6Let us follow the dog," suggested Maggie ;
a proposition to which the other willingly as-
sented.
Jule, at first, appeared to have no particular
destination, her course being discouragingly er-
ratie, pausing often to look up at the face of her
mistress and evince her satisfaction. Presently
the hound's discretion became more defined,

and they followed with increasing confidence
'er! actions indicated that she scented some-
thing ; and, after going a few rods further, they
discovered a man sitting at tie root of a tree.
Jule stopped, and eyed the figure with evident
doubt and curiosity, while h1u1je aL Margaret
shared the irs', if not the latter feeling. On
seeing the dog. which was some yards in ad-
vance of the young woman, the m:in arose, with
a sabre in his baud, and put himself ii a defen-
sive- attitud.
'-Is it a dog ye le ?" he inquired. in the very
voice of Barne  Manie. '"Phrliaps it.s a wild
baste ye are ! But you're slim for a dog, be ja-

Jule sat down upon her haunches, looked
blandly at barmelaid answered never a word.
" It's blockadin Iae, ye're afthmr ! Away wid

Barney made a hostile motion with his sabre.
Just then his eyes fell on the girls.
" Howly mother ! What's comm' now.I won-

Here are two faymale women as true as I'm a

Barney paused. scratched his head, then drew a
dirty fragment of a handkerehief from his locket.

o' truce is jist the chase. I'll go according to
the rigulations of belligerents, bedad"!"
Barney clapped the rag oi the point of his
sabre, and raised it over his head.
" Barrin- the color," lie said," it's as good a
flag o' truce. as iver was carried. "i ben, to the
girls: "Advance, ye faymales, and we'll ratify

" Surrender !" retorted  Margaret. "Lay
down your arms and surrender -"
" The Sixty-ninth never surrenders! It's like
Gin'ral Taylor at Bony Vista !" replied Barney,
waving his flag.
" W here is the Sixty-ninth ?" asked Margaret.
"I'm the Sixty-ninth intirely ! Every divil
of 'en, privates, commissioned and non-comr-
missioned, officers was jist killed where they
stood; so that the Sixty-ninth is myself, and

" Then you are the sole survivor of the Six-

tiis intelligence.

"That's jist it! You may set it down as Bi-
ble truth, every word of it. And this was the
fashion of the accident: We wint up to storm a
masked-battery of about two hundred rifle-can-
non, more or less, as the case may be ; and
very one o' them cannon was double-barreled
-a earcumstance I never see before in me life.
Well, as we marched up side by side, in illegant
order, they let fly at us, and down they all wint
but meself. I was shot through various parts
of me body, and afther what 'd happened, as
ye may well belave, I was in trouble in me
mind. I didn't stay only long enough to spike
a few guns, afther which I made a mastherly re-
trate. It's a sad day. O philliloo I Ochone'
Ochone !"
"It's a great lie you're telling, Barney Ma-
lone !" said the vivandiere, advancing, and show-
ing her person more filly.
" Who spakes?   What voice is that I hear?
What forrom is that I see ? It should be Maggie,
of the Seventy-ninth."
In his surprise, Barney dropped his flag of
truce.
"I am the vivandiere who gave you water
to-day, when you were carried to the rear in an
ambulance," answered Margaret.
" Cushla Machree ! It's some kind of a dear
that Iknew you was, little dear or vivandiere.
It's glad I am to see ye ! Come closter, that I
may put my two eyes on .something human.

" There's nothing to tell, Barney.  Our
troops are repulsed-that's all," replied Marga-
ret, sighing.
" Ochone ! My heart is heavy for it. We'd
a thrashed 'em, if they hadn't skulked in the
woods, behind breastworks and big guns. Sor-
row and grafe be unto 'em! Bad whisky and

der-cart, drawed by six horses running' at the
rate of three minutes a mile, fetched me a wipe
in the siall of me back, knocked me sprawling ,
so that the wheels wint over every part of me
body. But that misfortin was the luckiest
thing that happened to me during the day; for
another shell bu'st, jist then, doin' terrible exe-
ention, and covering' me with a hape of slain.
Philliloo! There I was, naythur able to move

" It was very dreadful, Barney," observed
Margaret.
" Ye may well say that ! God knows it's no
lie Im tellin'. But I kept me self-possession
wonderful. 'Pull me out,' sez I.
"'Pull who out ?' sez somebody else.

And with that, two soldiers got hold of me, and
with much pullin' and haulin', suesayded in

that was on me, there was about the full of two
wagin-loads, in a reasonable estimate. I had
now notlhin' for arms but me revoolver, havin'
left me musket with two secaders strung on the
sabre-bayonet, like a herrin' on a stick. But I
might been worse off than havin' six charges at
the pullin' of a finger."
" You were fortunate in being so well pro-
vided for," said Margaret, willing  to listet
Barney's adventures.
" As things happened, it was the luckiest
thing in the world," he resumed ; " for I had no'
sooner got on m pins ag'in, than I was in dan-
ger of being knocked off 'em by siven of the
Black Horse Cavalry, who come rampin' upon

" There's a little I mought say," answered
Scotto, with embarrassment, which he tried to
conceal by glancing at Margaret, and remark-
ing : " You're one o' them vivandere, I see ?"
"Yes," said Margaret, mechanically.
"Captain Scotto," exclaimed Hope, " you do
not speak frankly ! There is something you
fear to tell me."
" Nothing' more than one might expect in these
times. The colonel, your father, was wounded
some'at in the squirmish this evenin'," replied
the scout, avoiding the questioning eyes of Miss
Hu'rdlestone.
" Wounded 1" she repeated, while a sad, sick
sensation swept over her.
"It may be but slightly," said Maggie, sooth-
ingly.
" In battle, all men are mortal," said the
scout.
" Lead me to him at once !" cried Hope, in a
decided voice. " You fear- to tell me that hisr
Wound is mortal. I must hurry to him to heat'
his last wishes, and receive his dying benedie-
tion."   --                              -
"Follow," replied Scotto. "Mr. Murch, lendi

Sixtv-ninth, and mu't be cared for."
"~One of 'em, eap'n dear? Shure its the

quoth Barney Malone.
" You are tired, miss,"said Scotto, kind,, t
Hope. "Lean on an old soldier-a ara, .1

The admonitions of Scotto fell on the caof

" Father t father !" she exclaimed.
The wounded man opened his eyes. His foil-

daughter. That pale and beautiful countenanee
recalled to his recollection a teeming, touching
history of many years. He did not speak at
first ; thought was too busy with him fir it-
terance.
"Do you not know me, father ?"
"Know you, child ? I know you n w, and
shall know you forever ! I know and love you !
I am leaving you,- Hope."
" Leave inc not ! Oh, leave me not, father "'
