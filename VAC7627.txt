[IOOK up, sir' and show a more cheer-

a very absurd thing !"
The- individual to whom these words were
addressed, turned quickly towards the intruder,
and made a hasty and significant motion towards
the hilt of his sword.
"Keep your temper, my lad.     He who
speaks cares little for the flash of steel," added
the mnf.
"1Idesire to be left to my own meditations,"
replied the other, sternly.
s"You are not over-courteous ; good words
are j'st as cheap as bad ones, and, in most
cdes mSch cheaper. I'll wager a half crown to

not fear you I" exclaimed the young man, cast-
ing a menacing look at the intruder.
" Come, sir, I mean you no ill; smooth
down that threatening visage, and let it assume
something akin to good nature," resumed the
pertinacious stranger.
" It does not matter a straw to me whether
you mean me 11n or not. At this particular
time I care little for the opinions of men. I
ask for no new acquaintances. I only wish to
be left to pursue my fortunes -as best pleases
me," he answered, in a voice    less stern.
"But," he added immediately, "if you would
like to cross swords with me, I am ready; and
in fact, I rather think that would suit ine as
well as anything."
" If you cannot wield some implement of
industry better than the weapon you speak'of,

"Indeed! you do me too much honor !" re-
plied the other, ironically.
"Not at all; I.have a happy faculty of find-
ing out what kind of material people are made
of "
.Am extraordinary person, truly !"  -
"Right !" exclaimed the man, in a more
serious tone ; many persons call me extraordi-
nary, and have good reason to- think so. And
now, young sir, I will tell you why I have ad-
dressed'you.  I perceived that you were a
stranger in this part of the country; for few
acquainted in this vicinity venture hither alone,
especially at this hour when the sun is hiding
himself in the west. Your dejected air, and
moody looks, assured me that the world had
gone wrong with you ; and your dress was proof
'sufficient that you were not of high rank, but
very probably some ambitious, though disap-
pointed adventurer."
"How very flattering the man is !"
" Gently, sir, gently! .we shall know each
other'anon. I spoke to you, thinking it might
be very possible that I could throw something
in  your way that would advance your for-
tunes."
":You appear to me like one who has-yet his
own fortune to aike !" retorted the young
"-Gently again, my rustic knight; you must
not judge by the outside."
. "I only follow your example in doing so."
"I said something about your apparel,' I
adtit ; fbut beingyour senior by several years,
I believe that I may  afely saythat I am  a
better judge of human nature."
"To out short this conversation, if you will
show me the way out of this forest, and to the
o~prest inn, you will advance my fortunes, I
doubt not, better than you can in any other
"Be it so; I am going to the ' Silver Bell,'
ad will *illingly be yourzguide."-
SLesa4.on," said the young man, and the
twe '   away tegather.
. "II' would be: euve nient, if nothing more,
to          larunetaddress you ?" con-
tinued the stranger, pausing.

The young man hesitated a moment.
" If you should ever have occasion to want a
name to address me by, call me Albert'
Casside."
"And to be equally civil, I will inform you
that I will not be offended if you should call
me at any time Denis Wetzel."
While these two personages are in -search of
the "Silver Bell," we will attempt to give
some description of them.  .
The young man who had given his name as
Albert Casside, was apparently but little past
twenty years of age. He had evidently attain-
ed the full stature of manhood, as his goodly
height and well-developed limbs could testify.
Nature haby no means been niggardly in her
endowments, in regard to personal advantages,
although his dress was not such as to set them
off in the most happy manner ; he being clad in
the habiliments of the common people, accord-
ing to the style of the time of Edward the
second, who was then king of England. At.
his side the young man wore a sword that did
not seem in keeping with his russet freekt it
being elaborately ornamented, and heavily
mounted with silver.
The persotiage who had so unceremoniously.
addressed our hero, was probably' past thirty, of
a bold and reckless bearing, joined to a sort of
good-natured and rather obtrusive- familiarity,
that was not exactly consonant with, the feel-
ings of Casside, who did not relish the-idea of
being addressed as a mere- lad, without expe-
rience or spirit.  Whatever his lifer and history
might. have been, it was obvious that he meant
to keep it secret, inasmuch as he believed-, nah
matters concerned only hiniaelf. -Whop ,enis
Wetzel was, or for what object he was dsi msL
of making his acquaintance,, he was s b1lysely
indifferent; for he had reached a crisis i 1s
existence when ordinary -occurrences. coRi4 flt
easily attract much of- his attention; QCady
appeared'to be in a transition st e, and anx$ p
to work out some important proble , t

abeommodation. He was endeavoring to com-
pose himself to slumber', when he was. aroused
by a gentle knocking upon his door. Without
hesitation he arose and opened it, and much to
his surprise beheld Strolling Willie.
"Hush ! speak not a.word I" said tihe latter,
in' a whisper, laying his finger upon his lips.
Impressed with the mysterious manner of the
beggar, Casside allowed him to enter his room
and to close the door.
"Now, my good man, what do you want?"
asked our hero.
" I told you, young gallant, that it might
come to pass, in the order of Providence, that a
poor blind man might have it in his power to
do you a service ; it has happened so, much
sooner than I expected," replied the beggar.
"Proceed with your story," said Albert.
"When I had finished the ale and despatch-
edthe food which your kindness procured for
me, I left the tap-room and groped my way to
the stable where the horses of travellers are
kept. Thanking heaven that I was so well
provided for, I threw myself upon some straw,
and should soon have been asleep, had not two
persons entered the stable and began talking in
low tones. One, of them I knew by his voice
to be the host ; but the other I knew nothing
about.. I soon discovered that they were plan-
ning a robbery, and that you were to be the,
victim. Capet affirmed that he knew you had
money, for he listened at the door and heard
you counting it. They then arranged the de-
fails of the operation. It appears that there
is a private entrance by which they intend to
enter your room, about midnight, when you
will be most likely to be asleep."
'Let them  come," said the young man,
grasping his sword.  "Let them come ; I will
be ready for them."
Capet will not come, but his accomplice.
But I have not told all. In the morning when
you go to settle your reckoning, and discover
your loss, mine host will feign to be greatly ex-
asperated and say it is a trick to cheat him out

unceremoniously thrust you out of doors."
"The villain !" exelaimned (Jasside.
"If you will take the adviceof a blind bed
gar, you will let them rob you."
" That's blind advice, truly !" replied Cas
side, with a smile.
"I will explain; take the gold and silver
from your purse and fill it with copper coin like
this I have in my pocket," resumed Strolling
Willie, producing a handful of copper edin9
" All this trashy stuff'-does notianiount to the.
value of half a crown. When your putsei
filled with it, lay it on the table, and go toed
and to sleep.
" I like the idea very well," returned Albert.
"But I think it would be best to put in a few
small silver pieces."
"Not a single piece !" said Willie ; "because'
you wish their disappointment to be as great as
possible."
The young man immediately proceeded' to
empty his purse and fill it with the compare
tively useless coins, which the beggar had  re
ecived at different times from the hand of stinted
charity.
"We who subsist upon the benevolence of
others seldom feel the touch of silver," said the
stroller.
"Selfishness has outgrown charity," replied
Albert.
" Good reason have I to know it. Now lay
your purse upon -the table and go to bed unohobi1
cernedly."
"What will you do ?"
" Go back as I came."
" But it perplexes me much to'know how you
can go about from place to  place with su'h
facility, your eyes being, as you say, entirely'
sightless."
"You must know, my young friend, that
when nature takes away one faculty, she gives.
another to supply,_in some measure, its place; "
answered strolling Willie.
"There is some wisdom in that observation,"
said Casside.

Ican do many things, which some persons
who profess to have better sight than myself,
cannot do. Ah, sir, nature is not always in the
wrong ;, she is not always, a hard mistress.
My sense of hearing and of touch is strangely
acute ;, I can hear sounds to which common ears
are deaf, and take impressions of objects around
me before other eyes have seen them. I go by

pr with peculiar emphasis, " I- seldom  go

for me, if that be' the case," replied Albert.
" Main where you are," he added.   "I fear
you will not be able to leave the -room without
being seen."
"Never fear, sir ; I can grope about strange-
ly.  I will go so softly that my steps shall not
awaken{a sleeping'cat.  This is not the first
tine I have crossed the threshold of the Silver
Bell," said the stroller.
" Go, if you will; but be sure that you do
not leave the inn till you see me again," rejoin-
ed Oasside.
The mendicant, opened the door gently,'lis-
tened a moment, and then making a parting
gesture to Albert, passed out and closed it after
his.  Our hero replaced the chairs, and pre-
sently retired as directed by the stroller. But
he was not destined to sink immediately to
sleep, even had his mind been in a condition
calm enough to do so. Added. to the weight of
anxiety that preyedupon his spirits, and the
incidents of the evening, were the sound of
voices in an adjoining room.  Those sounds had
been but indistinctly heard while he sat by the
table, but the moment his head pressed the
pillow, they fell with greater clearness upon his
qars-; which circumstance'was partly accounted
for by the fact that he was considerably nearer
the wall that separated his room from the ad-
1iuing one, than in his former position.
Oasside strove to shut out the murmur of voices,
forget his cares, and soothe his perturbed mind
to a state of slumber ; but the increasing earn-

estness of the conversation carried on within a,
few feet of him -by the knownn persons,,effec-
tually kept him awake. He had no diilculty
in understanding that the, individuals whose
voices he heard were those who had recently,
arrived at the inn'.
"It was a daring affair," said one, whose,
voice Albert recognized as that of the younger
of the two, it being much less heavy than that,
of his companion.
"Most daring," replied the other.
"What can be done ?" continued the first.
"'That's the question to be decided. We
will keep our secret for the present, at all
events. I see no good that can result from
making ourloss known. If this adventure does
not hasten the fall of Mark Donhead, I am no
great reader of destiny," added the eldest of
two.
" We shall have good reason to remember
the Donhead Wood."
"To the dayof our death."
"The villains were bold, uncle."
"Had we met the rogues armed in proof,
and with lances in rest, we could ha e scattered
them like chaff. By St. John ! I long to have
a dash at the banditti of Donhead Wood !"
"They may be but common people, and un-
worthy of your arms, uncle."
"Gentle or simple, I care not, nephew; I
would not hesitate to chastise them could I be
placed face to face with them, armed as beseem-
eth a knight.  I do not mind so much the loss
of a few florins, as' I am angered at the audacity
of the villains who took them. It grieves me
that half-a-dozen cross bowmen should rob two
knights of known ability."
"Yes, I see where the shoe pinches, uncle,
and feel the same soreness myself. It will be,
best, I think, to send a trusty messenger to:---"
here the young knight-lowered his voice so much
that Casside could not hear what place was
mentioned : but he instantly resumed as before,
"with an order for money, and a score of men-
at-arms."

"There niight be rare recreation in a hunt
through Donhead Wood, nephew, I       rant.
The suggestion is worthy of consideration ; but
we .must strictly observe our incognito."
"True, uncle, that important secret must be
well preserved, for in these days' it is difficult
to know our' friends from our foes. . My head
is young and giddy, but it thinks, sir; it is
not, wholly ignorant' of its responsibilities ; it
begins to feel already the cares of --" here
again'Casside lost a few words.
" No doubt, nephew, and when your wild
oats are scattered with a liberal hand all over
England, you will become a pattern of gravity
and wisdom. But I have noticed that -our
worthy host is inquisitive, and we must be

guarded in our speech while stopping at the
Silver Bell."
"Observed you the two individuals who were
sipping their wine when we entered ?"
"I saw them."
"I liked not their looks," added the young .
man, "especially the more youthful looking of
the pair."
" And but little does he care whether you
like his looks or not," remarked Albert to him-
self.
Overcome at length by drowsiness he sank
into a-deep sleep, from which he did not awake
until the bright sunlight was streaming cheer-
fully into his room, in the morning.

CHAPTER III.
IsANDRA.  WEIRD ELE.

N the day following the events already
narrated, a young girl of about sixteen
years, accompanied by a lad of twelve, might
have been seen in one of the rural districts near
Mt. Palladore. - The latter carried a shepherd's
crook in his hand, and both were attired after
the fashion of the peasantry, according to the
prevailing custom of the times.
The soft airs of morning fanned the brows of
the young girl, and the pleasant rays of a cloud-
less sun danced along the grassy way at her
feet. . The expanding flowers smiled in the
gladdening light, and joyous birds, flitting from
bower to bower, warbled their sweetest notes.
Upon the verdant side of a hill of gentle
aseant contented flocks of sheep were feeding,
and sportive lambs cheered the eyes of the be-
holders with their innocent gambols. A little
to the left of the hill the waters of the Stour
could be seen wandering on -towards their final
destination-the sea.
Come, Isandra; let us sit upon this green
bank of earth, and rest," said the lad.
With a gentle smile, Isandra seated herself
beside the youth.

"I have been thinking of late that I should
like to be rich," added the latter.
"Why should you like to be rich, Louis ?"
"For several reasons," replied the lad. "If
I were rich I would give you money, and make
a fine lady of you. To be plain with 'you, sis-
ter, you seem too fair and delicate to work with
your' hands as the neighboring girls do."
"Labor is not degrading, brother Louis."
"Perhaps not, in the sight of God, but it is
in the sight of our wealthy neighbors. The
noble lords and ladies that we often see gal-
lantly mounted, sweeping past us, regard us as
the dust beneath their feet. And yet, Isandra,
in beauty of face and figure, you are not a whit
behind the fairest damsel I have ever seen."
"Do you know, good brother Louis, that
your love for me has made me appear to'pos-
sess all those qualities which you name&amp;":Any
object that we love seems fair to our partial
judgments."
"It may be so in many eases; but in this
particular instance, I have excellent reasons for
believing as I do; for all the young fellows
within half-a-dozen miles are in love with you."

"I am not -so vainl as to credit that tale,"-
said Isandra, blushing.
"That strange young gallant, who can talk:
O, bravely, and used to come here so- often,
once declared in my hearing, that your beauty
atonished him and made him forget every-
thing else.",
Isandra made no reply, but played with the
pet lamb that had nestled down beside her.
" I think that young man acted strangely ;
and I have sometimes imagined that he was
really some nobleman's son in disguise," con-
tinued Louis.
" What an absurd idea r" rejoined Isandra.
"Father told me the  mne when I said I
should like to be a page to some brave knight."
"And finally become a knight yourself 1"
added the young girl, soiiling at the earnestness
offthe lad.
"You have guessed it," reirned Louis,
"Yo would be much happier; tending yon-
der flock," resumed Isandra. "But who comes
hither ?""
"Sonie wandering sibyl, I trow."
" Ah, that's lucky ! we'll have our fortunes
told; these: old' wives have strange gifts," said
Louis, eagerly.
"They are mere   pretenders ; they know
nothing of the future ; the future is a sealed
book which mortals cannot read."
"That will do veryawell to say to keep up
appearances, and sustain a reputation for wis-
dÂ©ig ;but come to the case in hand, all lilke to
dabble in these matters--gentle as well as
einple."     .
While the .girl and the youth were speaking,
the personage referred to was fast approaching.
She was of gasulne height, dark-skinned,
wriled and bony: She wore a long garment,
something like the" domino of a monk. Her
head was destitute of any  onering save, that,
whish nature had bestowed -fthick giowth of

lhekenid 'aatick of goodl ength, budtshether
na weapon of defense     3 tyassist  ilvalk-
ing, wae.a matter of som   8.bt.
The old woman drew near andwtho

parently leig ing to notice Isandra and Louis,
seated herself ezantly opposite them under the
shadow of.some spreading trees.
"Are you weary, good mother ?" inquired
Louis.
"I have beeifweary many years, my son,"
returned the woman, quickly.
"You look.strong and well. I dare say you
have walked over a great part of England sines
yo u were young'?'
"-Walked # how- could  I help walking '
What else could I do but walk ? Walking is
the only relief for the miserable who wish to
die, but cannot."
"Then- you have been miserable ?"
"Look at nme andges! Do I look like a-
happy person ? ha, ha !"
-You   don't look  just right," returned
Louis.
" Doubtless you have uttered your prophe.'
cies in a great many places, and to many  r
auditors ?" said'Isandra, sailirig.
"Prophecies? yes, miss, and many a tite
prophecy have I uttered ; it is a gift I've had
for many a long year."
I never thought the future could beÂ°op'ed
to the goze of mortals. - There is too much
mystery about your trade for it to be true."
" Nature is full of mystery !" exclainnedthe
sibyl, bending towards Isandra and elevating
the left-hand. "'There is mystery in the wihd,
and in the rain; there is mystery in the thun-
der, and in the sheeted lightning ; there is mys-
tery in the wild hurricane, and in the deep
throes -of the heaving earthquake ; there is
mystery fi the tides of the sea, and in the foun-
tarns of waters; there iS mystery in the silerit
swingings of the earth around the sun i;and
there is mystery enthroned among the ebW -
less planets. There is mystery above, and there
is mystery below----on the ear      in 'the
heav4ns:; and the sleepless Gd      eest

CHAPTER IV.
THE KNIGHT. THE RENCONTRE.

THE individuals referred to were on horse-
back, and turning somewhat from their
way they drew near to Albert and Isandra.
The person who rode in advance appeared to
be a knight of some consequence ; and a little
in the rear followed his squire, bearing his armor
and his lance.     c
"He sits well in his saddle, but methinks he
carrieth himself proudly," observed Casside, to
his fair companion.
Louis, who had returned from looking-after
his flock, regarded the approach of the knight
with enthusiastic interest.
"You are thinking of the spurs that Weird
lsie promised you?" said Isandra, playfully ;
but the mind of the youth was so much pre.
occupied with his own thoughts, that he made
no rejoinder to the gentle sarcasm of his sister.
Has he the promise of knighthood ?'' asked
Albert, smiling pensively as he looked at the
thoughtful countenance of the lad.
" He bath indeed," she replied.
"A.a much as you have the promise of being
a fine lady I" retorted Louis.
the rustic maiden blushed deeply at this re.

joinder, and said quickly in reply to the inquir.
ing looks of Albert:
"The idle tales of a strolling prophetess-.
Weird Elsie."
By this time the knight had reached the spot
where the parties stood. He was, apparently,
near the age of Casside, and about the same
size, with the exception, perhaps, tgat he was
somewhat more slightly formed, lacking the full
development of muscle that characterized our
hero. He was richly attired, and judging by
his haughty air, seemed to attach no diminutive
idea to his own importance.
" Good youth," he said, addressing Albert;
"can you direct me the way to Motcombe
Manor ?"
" Return to the road you have left, and ygn
cannot fail to find what you seek," answered
Casside.
" Ah, what have we here ?" exclaimed the
cavalier, as his eyes rested upon the face of
Isandra.
" Nothing that need attract the attention of
a courteous knight," added Albert..
" Be quiet, simple youth i" said the knight,

with a frown.  "Upon my knightly honor,
here is rare beauty," he resumed. "Here is
a pretty flower shedding its fragrance upon ill-
mannered clowns. Come, fair shepherdess,
what may I call you?"
Isandra turned towards Louis and made no
reply.
"Both fair and modest," added the cavalier,
with a laugh.
"Sir knight, resume your journey and leave
us, simple people, to our own enjoyments," said
Casside.
"Silence, bold varlet !" cried the cavalier,
"It pleaseth me to talk with the maiden, and
the matter concerneth you not. Think yourself
lucky, if you escape without personal chastise.,
ment. Now, sweet shepherdess, let me hear
thy voice ; I would know if it be as sweet as
thy looks."
"Let us leave this spot,", said Albert, ad-
dressing Isandra.
.I must chastise this insolent hind !" ex-
elaimea the knight, unsheathing his sword and
urging.his horse to. the side of .Albert.  "I
cannot disgrace this good weapon by shedding
thy  as. b9rn blood, but according to knightly
I may trike such as thee with anything
~hiits age:.'
The   'iht lifted his sword torput his threat
'}-to eec  on,' but quick se thoughh, Casside
snY1"a i the shepherd's crook from the hand of
Louis";for he had left his own weapon'at the
'S1ver Bell), nd armed him in a moment.
Ahe cavalier grew red with shame and vexation,
andcalled to his squire to bring him his lance'
that he  eight beat the audacious peasant with
'its}stoul ashen handle ;but in this he was no
ore successful than in. the first. atteii; our
quickly knocked the weapon from his grasp,
and gave him a staggering blow upon'the head.
The knight was now ready to choke with in-
aon; for a  ilr from a simple peasant he
considered a foulaffront.
Lend me your sword, my friend, and I

{s sc yuir  di aveice hoarsewith pasio.
emember, my iord, that it  tarnish

the memory of your gallant deeds, if you shed,
the blood of this peasant."
"I care not-I care not !" he cried, leaping
from his horse. The squire gave him his sword
as desired, and Albert availed himself of the one
which was lying upon the ground.
Isandra stood pale and mute with fear, while
Casside awaited calmly the attack ,of the en-
raged cavalier, who was anticipating an easy
and speedy victory. . But he was doomed to a
bitter disappointment.  Our hero met his furi-
ous onset with skill and Coolness, baffling all
his mad efforts to give him a mortal thrust.
The squire watched the progress of the contest
with undisguised wonder. '
" The fellow has used that weapon before I"
he muttered.  " He handles it well-admirably,
toowell for my lord's good."
The countenance of Cassife during the con-
test. wore a calm and contemptuous smile. At
first he acted only on the defensive, and seem-
ed greatly to enjoy the disappointment .ad
Impotent chafings of his antagonist ; bid at
length, he began to act on the offensive, and

"Mount, and let u be off, in the virgin's
name I you can' perhaps settle this materat
somefuture time, for I doubt not you will ag
hear of this person !" exclaimed the squire.
The knight got on'horseback withoutword
of reply.  Albert gave the sword to Louis, who
handed it to the squire, with':the lance. The
cavaliers then moved away, and as thes-uire
assed   sside,'he said in a lowvoice.
"Young man, you have done a foolhrly
tGirg. You have mortally, ofFende  ygo

but 'thout par to sy anthi       o    lie

That was gallantly, doie g'. i 'Luis,
whose respect for Albert had greatly increased
during the last few moments.
'"TUnlusky hour! unfortunate event ! you
have, in protecting me, brought certain destrues
tion upon yourself !" exclaimed Isandra.  "Sir
Hugh Spencer, I have heard my father say, is
venrowerful with'the king."
"Fear not," replied Albert; " in protecting
you from insult, I would cross swords with the
king himself."     .
"'My father comes this way; we will hear
what his opinion is; whether it 'be indeed so
dangerous a thing to disarm an insolent knight,"
said'Louis.
"Ata;l, middle-aged man, of not very pre-
possessing exterior, approached 'the parties. If
the'face 'is' an index to the character, a very
high +estimate could not be attached to that 'of
Peter Vidal, Isandra's father.: Casside had
seen him but a few times; and had ever' been
favorably impressed with his moral worth ; for
sotid avarice was indelibly written upon every
feature: He bowed coldly to our hero and lis-
tened sullenly to the story of what had just
transpired.
'" So you have offended the son of Sir Hugh
Spencer; young man ?" he said, with a sarcas-
tibsmile.  "My fery youth, 'your head isn't
worth a' florin.  Sir Hugh Spencer is in reality
king of'England, though Edward the second sits
upo;the throne."'
' Buthe saved me from insult, father," said
Isandra, timidly.
"That was all 'very well,- and I am  much
o)iged to him., ;  hope he will get happily out
of the1,unpleasant business. I advise him-to
lye 'gland 'as soon as possible.   Come,
dagghtert, let us return to the; ettage," replied
Vi,.ga
Courtesy requires that you should ask ,he
young;in to gos with us; he has rendered an
important service," whispered Isandra.
As if half-ashamed of his ill-nature, Vidal
paused ant asked Albert to accompany them;
but perceiving that his consent to this proposi-
tion was by no means wanted, he prudently with-

held it,'and bidding adieu to;Iandra,'walked
away towards Donhead Wood.
Having entered the forest, te fiat ojeel he
beheld. was Denis Wetzel. lHe was. dressed w
the same manner as on the previous night, 'S4t
a heavy sword hung at his side. He manifested
some surprise at seeing Casside, and laughingly
inquired if he intended to take up his residence
in that dangerous region.
Albert replied that he had laid no plans for
the future'; that for the present all places were
the same to him.
"How like you our host of the Silver Bell ?"
asked Wetzel.
"If I wanted a scoundrel, I should know
where to find one," was the reply.
"Ah I have you discovered his tricks so soond
Strolling Willie cold me there was some cause
of offence between you this morning"
"He.stole my purse; that was all."'
"And you-"
"Came very near strangling him."
" A resolute youth 1"
" Bah ! that is a slight thing."
"You suit me better'and bettor."
"Well, the good will of 'even Denis- W'etzel
may be -preferable to his hatred."
" Possibly !" said Wetzel, coloring  and
biting his 'lips.
 " I wishryou good day," added' Casside,
moving away.
"Not' so fast, young man ; let us talk over
matters that concern us both."'
"You can talk of nothing that concern me,
certainly,"' returned our hero, somewhat loftily.
" Don't be too confident; we;shall see.' I
shall have to be plain with you. And in thew
first place I must ask if you will keep, forever
and a day, what shall passbetweenus here i

swered the young man, -earetlssly.

Wetzel.
" Proceed," returned Albert.
" Don't start, young man-his name is Mark

But Casside did start,,notwithstanding the
premonition of his new friend to the contrary ;
he quickly recovered his usual calmness of
demeanor.

a hard and dangerous trade."

"I reject yourproffers !" exclaimedCass ;
bitterly, feeling for the hilt of his sword ;,na,$

"The voice of reason is 'speaking to you',Â°I,

While making this remark, Casside turned
the pocket of his doublet wrong side out, and
saw his last forin disappear.-
"Now I suppose you will allow me to go my,
way unmolested ?"
The robbers looked at each other, as if to learn
what opinions prevailed upon the subject.
Those who had received the severest contusions
and bruises, appeared by no means disposed to
let the author of them depart in peace ; and
mildly suggested that it would be 'well to hang
him upon the nearest tree. But this proposi-
tion was at length overruled by the more humane,
and after being thoroughly searched to ascer-
tain if there was not more money concealed upon
his person, he was sufferedto resume his way
towards the Silver Bell.
He was shortly after met by Strolling Willie,
to whom he related the story of his recent loss.
"It no doubt appears a great misfortune to
you," said the mendicant; "but I have always
noticed that what seem great evils often turn,
out to be inestimable blessings."
"That's sorry'comfort to one in my condi-
tion V'
" I know of a monk who can well advise you
what to do ; he can, at least, give you shelter,
until Providence sends you better luck," added}
the stroller.s
I shill not ask aline quite yet," replied
Casside, raiber hanghtily.
"Idid not mean that ; but simply that you
should visit'the wise man who can make himself
ippy with a erust of bread and a cup of pure
'A rare personage !"
"*, you4 'ay well say so; there is not
another like him in England.  Now give par-
ticiilar attention,. and I will direct you how to
find him,"
To humor the, 'indly disposed beggar, our
hereo aitened to his directions, which were some-
Wiat complicated ; and to please hlniia-sil far-

he set out on his visit to Isandra Vidal. Joa.
chim Capet regarded his guest with anything but
friendly looks, and hinted pretty plainly that if
he did not see what color his money was soon,
it would be highly expedient for him to quit the
inn and seek other accommodations. He went
on to add thathis was the first instance in which
any individual had been. so bold as to complain
of losing a purse at the Silver Bell.
Casside's blood began to boil with vexation,
and seizing mine host by the nape of the neck,
he belabored him soundly ; which event pro-
duced a great disturbance in the hitherto quiet
precincts of the country inn ; but the employ-
ment afforded our hero the liveliest satisfaction
he had experienced for a long time. In the
midst of the excitement he pitched Capet with
not gentle hand among a quantity of empty
bottles, and bid a hasty adieu to the Silver
Bell.
He wandered about for some time without
any fixed object, being, in fact, in a complete
state of indecision. At length happening toile
some of the landmarks which the -stroller had
mentioned as guides to the resident' of the,
monk, he mechanically directed hisstepsyto the'
spot ; not indeed expecting any benefit, but"
merely because he knew not what elseIto-do.,
After he had-walked what appeared to bim T
long distance, he Was ready to reproach hinmO
that he had suffered the words of the' mendicant
to make a sufficient iapressionrupon hisJinind
to. think of them the 'second time. Soehe re,
solved not to see the monk, although he was
aware that he could not be far distantifroni'his'
habitation. '
But thetimeemployed in foming this reso-
lution was'lost; a man who pioed' io bethe
monk Datid, was already near hini, eld'f'ith
all the simplicity of hia calling.   "  :o
"Whom seek you, young man ?"he asked,
looking attentively atAlbert.'       "
"The monk David lives somewhere iih66t
'here, I believe ? he answered,Â°evasivelf. '
R'4 'tis 'bebib *  yo'" was thea ffe' te
reply. "Follo#u  "i."
O asside ;'as'4el ve seen, havingnahing,

betterIto do, and almost wholly indifferent in
regt  t' the tui'aaffairs might 'take, believing
that' he had got quite down to the foot: of the
ladder of adversity, obeyed the injunction 'of
father David, and'followed him -along a narrow
foot-path that1wound about in an eccentrieman-
ner.  They reached finally the most'lonely part
of the forest -that Albert had. seen.  The monk
paused before a' rude hut, in 'front of which was
a small rivulet.
"Here is where I dwell," he said.
" A most secluded spot, truly."
"It suits my purpose. . The real wants of
life are few, and if we are wise, we' can find
them  anywhere.   Nature  supplies me with-
water at small cost, you see, and my hut is :more.
capacious than it seems. Let us enter."
There was nothing very striking or worthy of
much description in the hut of father David.
It was indeed much more capacious than its
exterior indicated; a liberal excavation having
been made in the rear, forming a room of non:=
siderable: size,, so that the 'dwelling was coin-
posed hf two 'apartments, besides a small oratory,
orwhat 'subserved that purpose.
" Now, young'man, what' is your object in
seeking me ?" asked David.
Casside replied that he had'no particular ob-
ject in view, other than to gratify the whim of
a mendicant, who was desirous to-do him some
kindness out of' gratitude for sane trifling ser-
viee he had rendered him;, a serviceby the
way, not worth mentioning.
' Ihave seen the stroller since he gave you'
tliat' advice. He has told me all he knew of
yeu-eisfortones."        '
"He is ea' singular old creature; for I could
net'ilndmy way here' with both eyes open,
while he is deprived of the blessing' of sight
etitirely,"remnarked{Albert.
Fatherz3avid proceeded to clear his throat
by's ra; preliminaryahems;' but what pro-
fud wisdom .he was *about to butter, is: not
no* kiown, for 'a gentle knQeking upon the
d  rof'his  hut put an end to the contermplated-
The monk arose quickly in -some eonfuieon,

and hastily opening the little 'door that'ld4t
the apartment in the rear, he bade Albert etr'
and remain silent until the newcomer should'
be disposed of.  Our hero passed into-the room'
(which' was quite dark, 'havingmorethe appeal
ance of a cellar than of a habitable place); aan
the door was closed and fastened' upon him.
He,seated himself upon a block of wood, to
await the result, with the same feeling'of'in-c
difference that had characterized all hismnio e-
ments for the"last four-and-twenty hours. :He
heard the outer 'door of the hut opened, an
after a few words were exchanged, some peroa
was admitted. Presently, Casside heard the'
low tones of a- female vice, or such it appeared
to him ; and his curiosity.began to get the bet;
ter of his indifference. A female in the hut of
the monk 1' What' possible motive could bring
her to such -a solitary place ?2. Here was food
for curiosity, and Albert resolved to gratify his,
if practicable. He placed his ear close to the
rough wall and heard a voice that made him
start with unfeigned surprise. Could it be pos-
sible that Isandra Vidal was there?  le. would
listen again. He did so apd the conviction'that
forced itself upon :his mind, was the same. He
next proceeded to search for a crevice by which
he might gratify the eye as well- as the ear.
He found a small one without difficulty, and
the subject was no longer one of doubt. Isandra
Vidal was indeed in earnest conversation with
the monk-a circumstance which filled Albert's
mind with the most singular and uncomfortable
thoughts.
'Although ; he could not obtain a full view of
her face, it was evident enough that she-was,
considerably excited, and laboring under some
strong feelings of apprehension. In the frat
moments of his amazement, Albert was'5'greatly
tempted to dash down the door 'that separated
the apartments, confront the parties, and defland
to know the reason of th'i 'singular intei4liw.
But a moment's reflection made, him ahan-

" Much that was vilanous."
"I can guess ; he wished you to join the free

'"That is true.":

the monk, in the same tone.

THE CAVE O THE BANDITTI.

T JRE sober gray of evening twilight came
stealing over Donhead Wood.    Albert
Casside stood leaning against a huge fragment
of rock that had, in other ages, been burst
asunder by some strange convulsion of nature.
Not far from him, the figure of Denis Wetzel
stood pictured in the deepening gloom.
"Some hours have passed since we met; tell
me if you are less scrupulous than then?" said
the latter..
"I am," answered Albert, coldly.
"That is well; I knew that reflection would
cool your chivalric attachment to what people
call honor," added ;Denis.
"Circumstances have had more to do with
it than reflection. I have been robbed of all
the money I could call my own in the wide
world."
" Bobbed,, say you ?"
" Of the last florin ; but some of the knaves
of Mark Donhea4, I trow, have got such bruises
as will make them remember me for along time
to come."
" Did you resist ?" asked Wetzel, earnestly.
"Rust I I knocked them   over as I would

'

so many wooden saints. And I wish to impress
this fact upon your mind, that you may remem-
ber it as long as you happen to know me, that
I always resist every species of injustice. - Na-
ture has given me two strong arms, and it is
my established principle, to use them just as
often asT am the, object of a wrong of any
kind."
"Bravo ! you will do for Mark. But I warn
you to give him no offence, which your aptness
at the game of hard knocks might perhaps
quickly lead you to do. He is rather hasty in
his temper, and absolute among his men.  If
at any time he should give you a blow-"
"A blow, you knave ! I'd strike him dead
on the spot I" cried Casside, drawingshis sword
and springing towards Wetzel.
The latter did not change his position, but
stood before Albert with as much tranquillity as
hitherto:
"I did but joke, young man ; put up your
sword. If you conclude to have your name writ-
ten in the compact of the free companions, ye
will have pra6tice enough, without being obliged
to pick quarrels withtyour friends. Is your

' Yoti straight-forwardness is commendable.

emphatically,.looking steadily at Casside. A" We

"You, then, belong to the band?" said
Albert."

"I trust, then, that you' will do me"the honor
to conduct nie to theta presence of Mark bon-
head."

" Most perfectly ; lead on, I follow you to

Isandra, and a high chivalric' feeling which  r
prompted him to befriend the weak a nd 'hal-
less, he devoted-himself fully and completely to
this now enterprise.
Denis Wetzel moved steadily on, making
numberless eccentric windings' and turnings,
until Albert believed that it would have'been
quite impossible for him to have found his 'way,
unguided, to the Silver Bell, or to the hnt  of
the monk. lHe employed his mind during the
long and silent walk in maturing the plans of
father David. The latter he believed could be
fully trusted, for ha could conceive of no psei-
ble motive that he~ould have for betraying'himk,
or exposing him to'daager and death. He-'felt'
sure that:Strolling Willie was, or meant tobe,
his friehd. And here he could not help asking
himself if he"'%hid indeed reached that condition,
when he was to find'lys friends in the lnoVtt
walks-of life. For a moment the thought) an-
noyed him, but his'; better nature'soon banihed
such unworthy ides.'
Wetzel, who had hitherto walked on without
uttering a word; now stopped and remarked'that
there VA'e yet time for him to go back, if hfbelt
any regrets or misgivings. " Our hero' motioned

There was such a saucy leer upon the fellow's
face, when he communicated this piece of in-
telligence, that Casside could not well resist the
temptation of doing him  personal violence;
thereupon, incontinently doubling his fist, he
placed a blow upon the frontispiece of the ban-
dit, just above the bridge of the nose, that caused
him to change the vertical for the horizontal
position, and to see all' kinds of electric lights,
and stars that danced about eccentrically, and
couldn't keep still.
" Tell your master that it is thus I always
punish impertinence, and resist wrong," said
Albert, when the fellow began to show signs of
recovering the position most natural to human
bipeds.
When he had succeeded in regaining his feet,
he looked menacingly at the chastiser of his in-
solence, and obviously felt a strong desire to
retaliate upon him; but observing that he wore
a sword, and fearful, doubtless, 'of giving offence
to his master, Mark Donhead, his anger found
vent in threats and scowls, which were produc-
: tive of no great inconvenience or annoyance.
S 'e left the premises, muttering that his name

s

was Dick Strow, and that he never overlooked
a blow, but invariably managed to pay up the
score, with compound interest.
A few moments after the withdrawal of Dick
Strow, another of the band made his appearance
to inform him that although food was not allow.
ed him, wine in any quantity and of the best
flavor would- be brought in, if he desired it.
Casside signified that it should be produced
without delay ; and great was his chagrin when
a third knave opened the door and remarked
that Mark Donhead did not think it best to ex-
cite his mind by stimulants, while he was on
the eve of such an important change in his man-
ner of life; but the purest water should be
brought in its stead.
Seizing the block upon which he was sitting,
Albert hurled it atthe head of the unfortunate
messenger, and taking effect upon his head,
stretched him bleeding and insensible upon the
earth.
The neophyte stepped over the unconscious
individual, and proceeded along the great'na-
tural corridor, which led he knew not Wither.

f6r numborlesaformations similaro f ;  he
had seen, depended like enormous icicles from
the lofty roof, that gave back the dazzling glare
of the lights with extraordinary  effect and
brilliancy._
Extending through the centre of the saloon,
was an ample table, or what answered all the'
objects of one, and which was groaning, to use
a figure, beneath the weight of the viands placed
upon it.  Around this spacious board was seat-
ed a motley mass of human beings, whose bois-
terous mirth gave proof that they intended to
make the most of the present, without trusting
anything to the future.  There were among
them faces of manly beauty, and visages ren-
dered harsh and disgusting, by drunkenness
and evil passions.
Their drinking cups were just replenished,
and they were on the point of conveying them
to their lips, when Casside. made his unexpect-
ed debut. Every hand seemed paralyzed with
surprise, and all eyes were turned towards him
with a wondering stare.

'Wthoat heeding these indabitable signs of
asheihient, our-hbro walked boldly'ip to the
t6bl, and reaching over one of the ruisa'
s   det -took one.of the flowing cups, just
Muted out, and drank it off at'a raught. He
then replaced the vessel and took another, in-
te*ding that it should follow in the track of the

"I am one of the free=companions," replied'
asided. carrying .the brimming cup to his
mouth.
"It'sa lie-'a foul lie 1" retorted the robber,
femmsing with ire.
Without deigning any reply to this impute
tion, Casside, quick as thought, dashed the viae
iethebearded ruffian's face.
;Instantly a terrific scene ensued. The ban.
ditsprang from the table, grinding his teeth
wathifury, and drawing his sword, made a hur.
ried thrust at Albert, who, foreseeing the eon-
sqaenses of whathe bad done, had'tlready un-

as -he proceeded, and he resolved to present
himself boldly to the revellers, whatever might

reached, ere long, a large door which was closed ;
it was the only obstacle which separated him

Brave companions, let us forget- all past differ-
ehdee and.- welcome among us an able-bodied
and daring recruit.  Yoriek, relax your'brows,
and be 'reconciled.  Dick Strow, your honor
will sufer no taint, and your head will soon
heal   Those gallants, who, for, a little innocent
pastime -rifled this young man's pockets, I trust
will be willing to balance- accounts-and anoint
their bruises with the oil of forgetfulness. Come,
m ierry lads, of Donhead Wood, let us drink
awewing bumper to the neophyte."
This short speech produced , considerable
effeet; the tide of feeling turned in favor 'of
asside.  Instantly there was awlively rattle of
drinking vessels,, and the health, was drunken
with gusto ; although a few unforgiving faces
yares till visible.
All now addressed themselves to the busi-
ness of eating and drinking, our hero not ex-
oepted; who resolved to make'himself as much
at ehone as the most swaggering ruffian among.
them.
adrmous-quantities of food vanished as if
by magic, while servants, male and female, ap-
pearedto answer the}vociferous demands of the
revellers.  Hearts,'merry enough before, grew
merrier cheeks already reddened (with wine,
greiredder ; tongues  already voluble in the
utterance of profanity and bravado, grew more
and more voluble.- The.free companions{boast-
ed of their achievements, and discoursed, in a
vary eieited manner, ef deeds which they -yet
intended to accomplish. They talked-like men
who expected to gain;undying renown by their'
daring accts. Theyspoke of uptoriety and'fame
as being one and identical; that -to be noto-
riously bad, w's as'desirable as to be equally
oee+brated 'for -deeds of goodness and bene-
volenee:
SW-While these perverted 'beings were thus- en-
gigedand growing everygoment more'boister-
eua, a part of the band, which hadbeen deputed
tpon particular service, returned sucessful;a
bringing with them aiyoung lady,: who was left
by ;theOrders of Wetel -(who appeared to com-=
x ad n the absence of dafa]kouhead), in an

adjoining apartment. Room was instantly
made for the new-comers at the convivial board.:
They entered with much-zest into the details of
their recent -adventure ; and went on to state
the particulars of the manner in which they-
had taken;their fair prisoner.
Casside listened to the recital with absorb-
ing interest. The lady, it would seem, who
had been the unfortunate victim of this -ruffian-
ism, was of gentle birth and high station. She
had been one of a hunting party of lords and
ladies ; but imprudently allowing her spirited
horse -to carry her considerably in advance of
her companions, she had unluckily 'fallen into
the hands of the banditti; who, having had
previous intimation of the hunt, had been sta-
tioned, at intervals, in certain localities"favor-
able to their purpose.
The robbers, being'in uncommon good humor,
proceeded to give a very facetious account of
the panic which their unexpected appearance
had excited in the mind of the noble maiden.
They referred to her tears and entreaties 'as.
legitimate objects of laughter ;'and to her beauty',
as a -thing upon which every' knave had a right
to gaze. e
"t e has been rumored," said Wetzel, " that'
this damsel, who is now our guest, has been blest
with rare personal charms. Does she sustain,
think you, the reputation which the good -old
dame Ramor has conferred upon her ?"3
" I think I may safely say," replied one who
had been the ;leader of the recent expedition,
"that-I never looked upon a =fairer face or a
prettier figure ; although=the terror with -which'
our presence inspired her, has paled her cheeks;
and detracted, somewhat, frog her beauty."
"By St. Michael, my patron saint ! I mud
see this paragon I" exclaimed Wetzel,' em-
phatically.
Ay, we must all have a glance at hei   'l
cried a score of voices. "",Bring her in; bring=
her in, that we may be drunken with beautyir
as well as with wine I"f
"I care not," resumed Wetzel, "if in'this
matter you are gratified. Let thegentle maident'
be broughtin. Ho, there!  Yorick, and Dick

Strew, be you the escort of this queen of
beauty."
"With right good will !" responded-the per-
sonages addressed, who thereupon 'arose from
their seats and staggered forth to perform the
bidding of Wetzel; a task which appeared com-
pletely consonant with their feelings..
During their short absence a breathless silence
prevailed in the banqueting hall of the ban-
ditti. . Presently footsteps were heard; and all
eyes were fastened, upon the door where the
unfortunate lady was expected- to make her ap-
pearanee. The ruffians were not long kept in
suspense-; the door was pushed open, and
Yoriek and Dick Strow re-appeared, supporting
between them i helpless female.-
Albert Casside, whosd ears had been open to
every word that had been uttered, and whose
indignation could scarcely be repressed during
,the time the subject of this brutality had been,
under discussion, -did not, at first, raise his head
to look at the sufferer, fearing to trust himself
to do' so; but when he heard the laud shouts of
admiration which burst from the lips of two,
hundred inebriated men, he slowly and sorrow-
fully lood in the direction in which all faces
were turned.
The spectacle which he beheld caused him
to leap to his feet with the quickness of light-
ning, while his respiration seemed nearly sus-
pended with the intensity of his surprise and
consternation. He gasped for breath like one
in the agonies of drowning ; he pressed his
hand .convulsively upon his chest ; he clutched
at the air for support ; his face became of their
ashen hue of death,' and then flushed with the
crimson of a burning fever. AHe stood a mo-
meat powerless with emotions whichnone could
analyze, and then his strong manhood came
back to him again, and smoothed down, withI
magic power, the 'agony that convulsed his
breast, and raised the veins upon his forehead
like knotted cords. He folded his arms, that
had been thrown aloft so wildly a moment be- 1
fore, calmly upon his bosom; he drew himself
up proudly and firmly ; his respiration became
deep, full, and regular, and not a muscle of his

19

countenance rebelled Against his own inflexible
will.
He gazed around him   with.a pride and dig-
nity of expression that elevated him to be, .in
reality, the-master and leader of them.,all.  "
"Denis Wetzel !" he exclaimed, in-tones so
calm and yet so -deep that' they could not;fail
to fix the attention. of every one, except the
unhappy lady who had found temporary relief
in unconsciousness. "' Denis Wetzel; let this
unmanly exhibition cease. - Ihave stronglyea,
all-powerful reasons for " making this 'request.
If you refuse me, I swear, by.my honor,- whicm
I never tarnished by a base act,'that I willedl
you to a terrible account for ' the same.. You
perceive this weapon by my side ; Ihave worn
it from childhood ; it was buckled there -first by
my mother, at an age when its point, trailed
upon the groun. I as I walked. She told me that
it never was 'o ti drawn except in the cause of
the right-in the defence of the wronged and
the oppressed, and for the sake of lady-fair.
I have never forgotten the 'injunction, and so
help me the powers that preside over worth and
innocence, I will always obey it to the very let-
ter ! I can use this weapon with the skill and
strength of a man ; and if you do not choose to
order this unhappy maiden from this presence,
I shall make it the subject of a personal arbi-
trament by the sword."
Denis Wetzel, at the commencement of Cas-
side's address, sprang from his seat at the head
of the table, and drew his sword from its scab-
bard ; but before itsjonclusion, slowly sheathed
it and resumed his place.
The female, who had produced this extraor.
dinary sensation, was still supported by Yoriek
and Dick Strow ; but'fortunately for her, was
yet' insensible to what was transpiring. The
loveliness of her features, the purity of her
complexion, the symmetry of her proportions,
were indeed marvellous. As her beautiful per-
son lay unconscious upon the arms of the rob-
bers, her face and neck were not unlike , the
whiteness of the sculptured marble.
The bold speech of Albert produced a striking
re-action among the banditti. They gazed with

CHAPTER VII.
THE MIDNIGHT INTERVI$Ws.

T was considerably past the midnight hour.
The angel of silence had waved her wing
over the labyrinths of the banditti's cave ; they
no longer resounded with the sound of boister-
ous laughter or reverberated to drunken and
excited voices. The lights no longer flashed
brilliantly in the grand saloon, and the revellers
were looked in the embrace of heavy slumber.
Albert Casside was the occupant of a damp
and cheerless apartment. He was lying upon
some straw, securely ironed. Sleep had not
visited his eyelids; his brain was the theatre
of many distracting thoughts. Believing that
he heard cautious footsteps traversing the sub-
terranean corridor which led'to the gloomy place
of his imprisonmpent, he raised himself upon his
elbow and listened attentively. Some one paus-
ed at the door ; a key turned in the lock; the,
rusty hinges grated dissonantly upon his ear,
and a man, holding an iron lamp in his hand,
stood before him. It was Denis Wetzel, and
his expression was thoughtful and troubled.
" Have oorne,tosay afew words to you."
"Let them be brief," replied Casside.
"It would appear," resumed Wetzel, "that
the demon of rashness and audacity-has possessed
you for thelast few hours. I pereive that you
are resolved to place your neek in halter as
speedily as possible."

"And yours," retorted Albert, sneeringly,
"should have been thus placed years igo, be-
fore you had stained your hands with crimes at
which humanity revolts."
"Hold L" -exclaimed the other, sternly.
"Do not tax my patience more severely than
you have already done."
"Strike these fetters from my limbs," re-
joined Casside,." and then address to me such
language, if you dare. . Fulfil the promises you
have given me. I demand to be taken before
Mark Donhead."
" Your wish shall be gratified in due time.
You will feel his power, perchance, sooner than
you imagine. Your conduct, this night, has
been outrageous.  Speak : what is this fair
damsel to you? What sympathetic cord makes\
you feel her sufferings ?" added Wetzel.
"That is a secret that I shall keep ; it shall
die with me, if I die, and live only with me, if
I live. It is a secret most dear to me ; I will
share it with no brigand under heaven," return-
ed Albert,,firmly.
"You are in the wrong, young manI" said
the bandit. "I should be your-eonfUnt.".
"Tou/" exclaimed Casside, ssraically.
"Even I," rejoined Wetzel, kneeling beside
our hero, and with a-small haminer beginning
to remove the irons upon his limbs.

" This is an unexpected favor," resumed
Albert.  "I thought it possible that you had
come for another purpose."
" To -assassinate you, perhaps ?" replied the
bandit.
" That was my conviction," said the young
man.
" That proves," continued Wetzel, " that
Satan does not always get his due ; that he is
often basely slandered ; that he is maligned- in
various ways ; that on account of former mis-
deeds, he is seen with distorted vision by all
eyes. But'come ; your limbs are free again.
Arise, and let us discuss matters in a more
-amicable way. I will tell you the circumstances
respecting this gentle damsel, whose appearance
operated upon you so wonderfully, Not many
days since, Godfrey Ridenger, the second in
command, chanced to see her, in the vicinity of
Moteombe Manor. He was smitten with'her
beauty,,and conceived the'bold idea of bring-
4g  her'hither."'
"And did he not fear the anger of her
father ?" asked Casside, hastily.
"I trow 'not," answered the bandit.  " We
are not wont to fear great names. We are
x6re' powe'fil'than the lord of Moteombe Manor;
we can defy him to his teeth. Mark Donhead
.F ah'rger retinue of men-at-aris, than the
haughty father of-our fair guest."'
" But where was this Godfrey Ridenger dur-
igthe scenes of the past night?"' inquired
A16?t.
"rie *as'away oi another service, and the
eajtureiof the maiden was entrusted to other
hetide: * Had "he been present ia person, he
would dodibbless have objected to exhibiting her
i'o r fellows in' the manner which was'seen'by
; 7. And lam free to confess that-had" I not
1asinflaianed' with wine, I should not have
peaitted 'it."
"tIt was unmanly-it was brutal I" 'said
"   Was not 'gallant, at' lidst," added Wet-

haw-yet some sense of honor remaining. Your
last words remove some of the unpleasant im-
pressions which your late conduct produced.
Wetzel, this gentle girl'must be saved from the
fate that Godfrey Ridenger is preparing for her.
His accursed projects must be thwarted forever.
I will move heaven and earth to save her."
Wetzellaid his hand heavily upon Casside's
shoulder. and said, impressively:
"I ask once more, if you. will tell me what
relation you sustain to the daughter of the lord
of Moteombe Manor'? Is it possible that you
have presumed to love one so far above you in
station ?"
" On that subject I shall still remain silent ;
you have had my answer.   You must already
know me well enough, to be aware that my
purposes are fixed and strong ; that I do not
change them without reason."
"So he it," returned Wetzel, decidedly.
"Know, then, that Godfrey Ridenger is pow-
erful, and that the maiden could not be wrested
from him, were she born of the noblest in the
land. No matter if she were the 'daughter of
the Eail-of Kent, or even a princess of the blood:
In this case, my fiery youth, you are more than
matched.  There is a power opposed to you,
with which you-cannot successfully struggle."
" But 'Mark Donhead-"
" Mark Donhead hiinself'eadhot'easily control
the actions of Ridenger," interrupted Wetzel,
impatiently.
"I hadisupposed that Mark was absolute;"
resumed Albert,' thoughtfully.  " Bat it ap-
pears that he is not; that he is ruled by-a. sub
ordinate officer'; that he is not the iron heart I
faicied-him to be.",
"He is absolute !"' thundered Wetziel, strik-
ing his foot against. the ground violently. "He
utters afoul'lie who affirms that he governs With
a feeble hand."'
The bandit paused; and' walked hurriedly
across the apartment a few' times, and then
added :
"But enough of this ; drop the suhbjeat, and
ieer let'it be ieiumed again.  ]oiead will
not interfere in'this matter; it'is 'not for hin%-

terest. He is not a fool. He will notfnedgle
withwhat does not concern him, without cogent
reasons. Give your thoughts to other matters.
To-morrow night you will be enrolled among us.
Forget the past ; gather up your manliness, and
prepare yourself for the imposing ceremonies of
the initiation.  "Come, follow me to a more
comfortable apartment.""
Taking Casside's arm, the bandit conducted
him through several windings of the cavern to
the place which ,he had first occupied. He
found there a comfortable couch prepared for his
reception, and a sideboard loaded with various
kinds of eatables and choice wines.
"Here," added Wetzel, "you may make
yourself comfortable, and even happy, if you
will be reasonable. Take the world as you find
it, and not try to remedy evils which cannot be
remedied ;,submit patiently to ills which can-
not be cured by the most skilful leech."
Albert threw himself listlessly  upon the
.couch and made no reply; -but had internally
marked out the course',he intended to pursue,
and the rules by which he resolved to be gov-
erned, in relation to matters which lay nearest
his heart.. Denis Wetzel poured out a glass of,
wine, drank it off, and once more left the
neophyte, to eat, to drink, to sleep, to reflect, to
repent, to kill himself with his own sword, or to
do anything els  hich he could, under the cir-
:cumstances.
Casside, chose, however, to remain precisely
as the bandit had left him. The idea.of repose
did not, occur to him; ,his mind was to deeply
engrossed with other matters-affairs, to, him, of
.thefirst importance. But he waa not destined
to remain long undisturbed,; he heardi steps
without in precisely the same manner as be had
- .  the case of Wetzel's recent visit. He heard
a key placed in the lock, and the door opened,
as on that occasion. That event appeared to
him to be quite natural-; but, the, advent of
.his present visitor seemed wholly the reyerse;
for it was no other than Strolling Willie, theI
IbJn beggar.
Motioning our heroto observe the utnIggt
silence, he closed, 'relocked the dor, and ap-

preached the couch upon which Cassid was
lying.
" I am probably the ,last person whom  ypr
expected to see !" said the stroller.
" Nothing could be truer than that remk,"
replied Albert, looking at the. mendicant as if
disposed to distrust the evidence of his senses.
"How, in the name of all the saints, did you
get here ?" he added.
" Naturally enough ; by .instinct--nothing
but instinct," returned the new-comer.
" Nonsense I" retorted Albert. "There is
a deeper mystery about this transaction than
instinct. Men's instincts usually lead them in
different directions; and persons of your call-
ing to any place but this. Bah! instinct,!"
" Very  wonderful is instinct,"  resmned
Willie, musingly. "It directs the footsteps of
the poor blind man to haunts, which the acutest
eyesight in the world might never discover."
" Well, keep your own secrets; let it be in-
stinct, if you will," rejoined Albert.. "And
now be good enough to tell me the object of
this visit'?"
" It is to do all that one of my condition may
to assist you; to give.you, perhaps, a word or
two of advice which may prove useful," replied
Willie.
" Mysterious man ! say what you pleas.
I am ready to listen !" exclaimed Casside.
" In playing at this dangerous gagpe," re-
sumed the mendicant, " you need much .cun-
ning and prudence. In regard to the maiden,
at present a captive, you must operate more by
stratagem than, by violent measures. Physical
force may prevail when one meets his eey
hand to hand ; but not whin he is opposed tq a
power that he cannot, comprehend, and whih
appears to' spread itself out in all diristiw.
You cannot well battle with.the arm of mnl t
which holds the damsel in its grasp; it re
a long way; it has power to crush its enemies
at a great distance. Be calm, and act opptious.
ly, and there are those who will o-eeate
secretly with you.. Cease to irritate Jep

" I doubt it not," returned Albert, seriously;
" and although bereft- of all that could make
existence endurable, I am-ree to acknowledge
that af this moment I shrink from death ; that
cold and chilling thing that freezes up the vital

to desire to prolong life ; it is nature-a voice,

more cease to hear, than you can cease to feel
the wants of hunger and thirst, and innate
longings for happiness. The love of existence
is strong in young hearts and strong in ol-:-in
the latter but too, too strong. But I wander
from fny purpose ; I am babbling of that which'
I should endeavor not to think of ; for sufficient

head are as fixed as the 'decrees of fate; the
'sword rises and falls at his bidding;'.he is tr
embodiment of strong passions ; he is' rapid in

" It meads," said the individual addressed)
" that life is  - pilgrimage.  You perceive that
all those assembled here, are clad precisely in
the same manner; it is to represent the equality
of man. You observe that each has sandals

Casside bowed acquiescence, and theguide

them, and finally lost itself in darkness.

CHAPTER IX.
THE INITIATION.

" 14A

fjT Was the night of the initiation of Albert
Casside into the opening scenes of a bandit's
life An individual, clad in the habit of a monk,
had passed two hours with the neophyte, giving
hini' acli instructions as were deemed appro-
priate an ,n sse d, fd in a simple gar-
moist resemingt          with sandals upon
his feet, and.a sta  his band, he was led
through the long corridor into a large apartment
adJoining the grand saloon. A number of per-
- sons clad in the same costume preceded and
wentbeliind him. The passage was but dimly
light, antilow and mournful strains of music
floatethough the labyrinth. Arrived at-,the
apartment, Albert perceived, at the farther
extomity, an elevated platform, accessible by
ste supon which was seated, on a sort of
throne, a man clad in costly and splendid ap-
parel. Extending the whole length of the com-
partment, upon.the right and 'upon the left, in
tW b s, were many individuals attired' like
Myself.
Adfranting to a person seated in front of the
platforhi, \Casside inquired to know the .meaning
of what he beheld.

They appeared to be weary and dispirited ;
soon they fell down and seemed to expire by
the way, uttering deep groans and piteous
lamentations.
" Those are some of the pilgrims whom you
have seen ; discouraged, at length, and worn
out with the vain effort to attain to happiness,
they perish miserably upon their pilgrimage."
The guide continued to move forward, and
anon the passage appeared to be strewn with
human bones.
"These are the remains of the pilgrims,"
added the conductor.
"And have they all shated the same fate ?"
asked Albert.
"1No : a few bold and indomitable spirits
have discovered a shorter way, and have suc-
ceeded in attaining t,o the summit of their hopes.-
Follow, and you shall look upon the'successful
few."
The cicerone turned abruptly into another
passage. The doleful music ceased ; the lights
Mashed up more cheerfully, and they passed
alcng with greater alacrity. jn a moment they
stood at the entrance of-the grand saloon. Two
persons, "in the livery of servants, threw it open,
and a magnificent spectacle dazzled the eyes of
CJasside.
The banditti, arrayed in their most costly
od imposing garments, holding drawn swords
in their hands, stood motionless as statues upon
each side of the long table, upon which was
sprea4 every luxury which could tempt the
pate of an ;epicure, or which wealth could
p*eeure.  At the head of the board, more rich-
:ly- arrayed than all the others, with a crown
upon his head, and a sceptre in his jewelled
. an&amp;,' sat the individual whom Casside had
known -as Denis Wetzel.
"What moral truth is intended to be illus-
tated 'by this imposing sene'?" asked Albert.
" These are the'pilgrims, ;who, despising the
piejddices 'of 'weak and superstitious minds,
have found a new ana certain road to ease.and
" afnee. These are persons who are governed
qav -by their-own desires ;. who believe in the
equal distribution of property; -who will'not

PER BELL.

starve while the wealthy are rolling in luxury ;
who will not suffer wrong and injustice ; who
appropriate to themselves whatever nature seems
to crave ; who take food when they are hungry,
without asking whence it comes ; who drink
wine when they are' thirsty, without inquiring
in whose cellar it acquired its age and flavor.;
who put gold into their pockets, without trou-
bling themselves about the mint where it was
coined, or the coffers from whence it was taken;
who make the sword the great umpire of all
questions of right and title ; who live for the
present, and take no thought for the future ;
whose motto is ' eat, drink, and be merry, for
to-morrow we may die.""      ,       ,
" These principles," returned Casside, fol-
lowing the letter of his instructions, " are in ae-
cordance . with my philosophy. I have - long
believed that life was a thing to be enjoyed.
Tell me, sir, how I may become a member of
this brotherhood ?"
" By proving your courage and ability, and
by subscribing to the laws which hold them in
solemn compact."
"I request you to propose me for member-
ship to this wise- fraternity."
"Prefer the request to Mark Donhead,- the
leader of the free companions.  That is he,, ait
ting at the head of the .  upon the elevated,
seat."                  ',,'.:
Albert Casside could repress 'his surprise at
this disclosure, only by a strong effort of the
will., The truth was at length apparent; Dbnia
Wetzel and Mark Donhead were-idential.
"Daring commander of these bravemg.   f
said Albert, 4"I desire to be admitted tio the
secrets andiprivileges of your order."
Mark Donhead made no rejoinder, but slowly
waved his sceptre. Immediately several per.
sons: clad in black marched into the salojn
through the open toor, and proceeded to remove
a - rge aereen upon the left, when several in-
dividuals were seen, with their swords croseea4
inthe act of commencing a combat. The Mcr
flict began and was carried on with m ehapirit
and determination, until they sankAdow  ap
parently, from wounds and exhaustion.

You see   usat w.  A   is scene,
said the conductor,'" that the followers of Mark
Donhead are never to fly from their enemies ;
but to fight until victory crowns their efforts,
or'death lays them low. Each person is solemnly
pledged to die with sword in hand, or peace-
- ably in bed, and never to perish by the arm of
law. The hemp is not grown that shall stran-
gle'one of our order."
Again Mark Donhead waved his sceptre,
and a second screen was removed, revealing the
appearance of a large building of stone, with
grated-windows, which was strongly guarded by
men-at-arms. Suddenly a party of men, clad
like the banditti, rushed upon them and after a
short and decisive struggle, defeated them.
"That gloomy edifice," resumed the cicerone,
"is a prison, and the men-at-arms, are the sol
diers of the king; .and the whole is intended to
convey the'idea that if any of our brethren, by
any unavoidable necessity, be captured and
imprisoned, that the brotherhood is to make
'every possible effort'to set them at liberty, even
at the hazard of life and limb."
Mark Donhead for the third time waved the
emblem of power, and the third screen upon'
being withdrawn, displayed to view a block
and an executioner, with an axe. Near the block
knelt a man. whosghands -were bound, and
whose neck was bare.. A priest stood beside
the culprit, and Casside recognized in him the
monk David. In a solemn voice he read the
service for the dead. When he had finished,
the kneeling man proceeded to utter a prayer,
whose deep earnestness made Albert's heart
beat fast with apprehension. He prayed like
one standing on the threshold of death ; like
one whose last and only hope is in invisible
power ; like one who already feels the agony of
dissolution ; like one who strives to master an
awful shrinking from a fate which he knows he
cannot, by any possibility, 'evade. He ended
his fervent appeal to Heaven, but still seemed
anxious to prolong the moments of existence.
The monk attempted to comfort him with as-
surances of a better life, and to make him com- T
prehend that the pains of dying were short, and
not so- dreadful as they appeared.

I

The culpritgroaned in spirit; e
self devoutly upon the breast with his pinioned
hands, and with a shudder, laid his head upon
the block.
Albert's heart beat with intense excitement ;
he felt a sickly faintness creeping over him;
and his brain grew dizzy with horror. - The
axe descended like lightning; the man's head
was severed from the body--the streams of life
rushed forth in crimson jets, and the liinbs
quivered in the throes of death.       -
The scene was indeed too real; a hunan
spirit had passed to its account.
"It is thus," added, the Cicerone, "that
Mark Donhead punishes traitors."
Instantly the low, mournful strains of mar-
tial music again resounded through the cavern,;
the lights in the'greatsaloon suddenly grew dim.
There was a short interval of profound silepee;
then the body of the unfortunate who had been
beheaded, was brought forward in an open
coffin and placed at the foot of the table.
.Casside1 whose senses 'had been- stunned for
a moment by the terrible scene which had just
been enacted, now endeavored to shake off the
fearful impression which, it had made. - The
cicerone whispered a few words of instruction in
his ear.
Albert immediately knelt beside ,the coffin,
and placing his hands upon the dead man's
breast, said, in a clear and distinct voice :
" When I betray Mark Donhead or his fol-
lowers, may I become even as this man. May
my punishment be sure and speedy, like his,
and may no angel of mercy be near to avert my
doom."
When he had pronounced these words, the
lights burned brilliantly once more, the solemn
music changed to a lively measure, the body of
the traitor was removed, and all the emblems of
the initiation disappeared. Two men, bearing
a large roll upon their crossed swords, entered ;
the roll was laid upon the table, and a pen was
given to Albert.
" Read the contents of this parchment," Con-
tinued the cicerone, " and then place your name
at, the bottom."

IT was near the hour of rosy morn. The
bhechanalian revelry had ceased. The fol-
lowers of Mark Donhead had reeled to their
coudhes, and their senses . were again looked in
lethargic slumbers' Our hero was alone, oc-
cupying the same apartment which had been
clotted him on his first entrance to the secret
haunt of the banditti. He had indulged but
earingly in wine, for he wished to keep every
faculty of the mind in a state of tranquillity, in
order to beable to seize upon any circumstances
that might occur, favorable to his purposes.
The scenes of the initiation had made a deep
impression upon him, and ho recalled, with a
cold thrill of horror, the tragedy that had mark-
45 the final scene.  In imagination, he saw
once more pictured before him the kneeling
Agare of 'the traitor, witnessed the throes of
goxny which shook his frame, and heard the,
folce of his despairing prayer. Casside cover-
ed his eyes; as if to shut out from his mental
eight the remainder of the spectacle,
*,And this," he said to himself, impressively,
" and this may be my fate I"          -
With a sigh he raised his head and turired

a startled look towards the door; for he heard
it moving, in the act of being opened ; Strolling'
Willie was again hisv isitor.
"You corme and go as mysteriously-as the
spectres of the night. What brings you now-?
said Albert.
" My limbs bring me, and my instincts guide
me," replied the stroller.
"Your purpose, then ?" added Albert.
" To aid you; to prevent the meshes of Mark
-Donhead's power from enclosing you inextri-
cably; to assist you in dealing with one who is
wise as a serpent, and as strong as- a lion ; to
help you play skilfully the game, upon the re-
sults of which are staked life and death," re-
plied the beggar.
"It'may be thus, I know not," answered the
young man, "and, after all, it may be quite the
reverse. - it is said that the tempter often pre=
sents himself to mankind in a garb least'e*pedb&amp;

metidienut, " gives you some idea,/doubtless, of

plot thickens as you proceed.  The unexpected
appearance of this high born damsel in whom
you appear to be so strangely interested, throws
around you another strong influence to drag you
forward to the consummation of your ruin.
Against occurrences not anticipated, the most
skilful schemer cannot always guard ; but I
shall nevertheless make an effort to bring this
affair to a- successful termination. - On this oc-
casion I have sought you to reveal a most val-
uable secret; a secret which will prove of the
most vital importance, if kept, and of the most
fatal consequences, if betrayed. The revellers
are sleeping soundly ; the fumes of the accursed
stimulants which they have swallowed, paralyze
all their mental and physical powers; but, not-
withstanding this, we shall incur some risk in
the adventure to which we shall now address
ourselves.  Follow me, and I will make a
curious revelation."
Wandering Willie took the small iron lamp
in his hand, and passed from Albert's apart-
ment into the main shaft of the cavern. Albert
mechanically moved after him, wondering what
new mystery was about to dawn upon his senses.
The stroller stole softly onward in a direction
opposite'to the entrance of the' cavern. In a
few moments he left the lofty corridor, and fol-
lowed the fantastic: turnings of a-smaller and
more obscure passage-a damp and rugged way,
as cheerless asthe tomb itself.  In the cold
and mephitic airs the lamp burned feebly, and
4lbert's respiration was considerably affected
ly the same -circumstance.-
"his is a way seldom travelled," whispered
Willie, "and were we, by any untoward acci-
dent discovered here, weishould never travel it
again. We will look, for one moment, into
that;passage to-the right."  The stroller turned
in the-direction indicated, and after going a lit.
tle,distance, reached a large and dismal com-
partment.                     -
"It is here," resumed the beggar, "that the
banditti-bury their dead."             ..
Albert surveyed the spot as well as he could
by the dim light, and beheld quite a number of
mounds, and one which had just been made.

He recoiled with horror, and a voice seemed to
whisper and tell him the secret of that recent
grave. He felt an indescribable sensation of
relief when the stroller turned and retraced his
steps.
The latter now proceeded in silence, -and
Albert followed him with sad, gloomy, and fore-
boding thoughts. His guide paused, at length,
at what appeared to be the end of the passage.
"What now'?" inquired Albert. "   I see
nothing that can interest me in this damp and
chilly place."
"Be patient ; do not jump so hastily at con-
clusions. There are a flight of steps here some-
where ; do you see them ?"   ,
Our hero glanced about the spot more par-
ticularly, and discovered a flight of stone steps,
which seemed to be more the work of nature
than of art.,
"Now," continued the stroller, "you must
observe the profoundest silence. Follow me,
and step lightly."
"If the blind lead the blind, -will not both
fall into the ditch together ?" answered Albert,
in the same tone.
"Not where the faculty.of instinct is fully
developed," rejoined the beggar, with a smile.-
He then mounted the steps and soon reached
the top of the flight, where all farther progress,
seemed to be denied -by a wall of solid rock.-
Willie pressed against it with his hand, and lo
there appeared an opening of sufficient sie to
admit the body of a man, through which the
stroller passed, motioning Albert to imitate his
example.
He did so, and upon looking around, found
himself in what resembled, in every particular,,
a wine cellar ; for it was filled with casks and
bottles both large and small.  Albert did, not
express the thought which was in his mind, aid
his singular guide kept on,. ascended another
flight of steps, which were obviously the work
of human hands (being made of wood), ; an
raising a trap door, emerged from the cellar into
what - appeared to Albert a small room above
ground.
Again warning our hero to observe the groat-

'      est caution, he crossed  the apartment and
mounted athird staircase, leading, as the others
bad done, to an ingeniously contrived door. The
surprise of Albert cannot be easily conceived,
after creeping through the third aperture, upon
discovering himself in a chamber precisely like
that which Joachim Capet had assigned him at
theSilver Bell.
"Do you recognize this'?" asked the mendi'
cant, in a suppressed voice.
" I think I do," returned the young man ;
"and if it were not so far from the cave of the
banditti, I should say it - was the chamber I
recently occupied at the Silver Bell."
"You are right," rejoined Willie; " we are
indeed aVJoachim Capet's inn."
"Impossible !" exclaimed Albert.
Oh the contrary, quite possible ;; for your
long walk to the cave, under the guidance of
Mark Donhead, was purposely intended to give
you a wrong impression of the locality."
"This is indeed an important secret," said
Albert.  " Is it known to all the banditti?"
"It is known only to those who have proved
themselves worthy " of the confidence of Mark
Donhead. The mysterious connection of the
robber'' cave with the Silver Bell is not reveal-
ed until after the term of trial has expired, and
the new-comer has acquitted himself to the
general satisfaction of all 'oncerned. Some
belong to the band for months, without having
any knowledge of the subject, and it is a secret
of which you would have known nothing, had
it not been discovered to you in this manner.
The time may arrive when the knowledge you
have this night acquired, may be of incalculable
use. Some unexpected event, or some terrible
contingency maf occur, from the consequences
of which you can only escape by means of this
singular connection of the cave with the -ilver
"tJoachim Capet then, of course, is but the
agent of Mark Donhead ?" said Casside.  ,
"He is in the secret ; it could not well be
otherwise, and a more selfish and money-loving
knave never walked," was the rejoinder.
While our hero and Willie were carrying oni

this: whispered conversation, the murmur of
voices reached them from an adjoining room.
The stroller placed his ear to the wall and lis-
tened, and then made a. sign for. Albert to o:
likewise. The 'tones which he heard did not
sound altogether unfamiliar.
"I am rejoiced to hear this news," said one;
"the affair must now terminate in- a manner to
suit .my wishes. I see no means by which the
Lady Eveline can escape the meshes of my
power. Yonder subterranean vaults keep well
their secrets. She is proud-she - is spirited,
imperious; she must be subdued, humbled,
humiliated. 1 And, perhaps," he added, in a
voice of deeper significance, " degraded."
" Act your pleasure, sir knight," replied
another voice,," but I tell you frankly that I
like not thisÂ°mode , of wooing the fair damsel.
I would greatly prefer to woo her on' bended
knee, and with words most fitting and gentle."
" Woo how, when, and just as often, as you
please !" retorted the first speaker, " and.I will
not find fault with you ;- but I reserve to my-
self the same liberty. However, I proposed,
honorably to this haughty maiden, once on a
time, but met with no reciprocal response. I
never forgave her for being indifferent to my
suit, and am now putting in practice a fixed
purpose of retaliation. I know that the news
of her.violent abduction will spread like wild-
fire all over the country, and great efforts will
be made to discover tie perpetrators ; but they
will be able to find no traces of her ; for the
cavern, in Donhead Wood, does not disclose its
mysteries. But in regard to the rude fellow
who gave my honor such a wound a few morn-
ings ago, I must devise means to have him
punished. Have you sent for Herbault, Mark's
executioner'?"
" Yes, I despatched Joachim Capet for the
ruffian," replied the knight, somewhat contempt-
uously.
" You have no great relish for this business,
I perceive," retorted the knight, sharply.
" Iut I care little for that, providing you do
not play me false ; in which event, methinks,
it will go hard with you. Since you have been

the stroller, " for every moment is precious. I

IW ANDEtING WILLIE paused and
turned toward his companion, Axing his
sightless eyeballs upon him in a manner to in-
dieate the deepest earnestness.
- Could I by any means have ;foreseen that
Godfrey Ridenger would have returned so soon,
and that Herbault wouldhave been sent for, I
should hot have conducted you hither," he
said ; "but the' gift of readit .the!events of the
future is denied to mnortalsv  Having u nder-
taken this adventure, we must conduct it boldly
tor a conclusion. You already know for *hat
purpose the services of the assassin are required,
and who is to be tke object of this'horrible
trade. The conversation to ,which you have
just listened has quite accidentally made you
master of an important) secret, *hich may or
may not be of use ; the hext few hours will, de-
termine. We are 'now exposed"to- the danger
of meeting fark Donhead's ruffitn on his way
to the Silver Bell."
"Can'wesnot secrete ourselves in the wine
cellar until aftetHerbault has passed though ?"
asked Albert.
" Possibly we might; but discovery would
4

be almost inevitable. I hope to gain tie main
shaft of the cavern before he reaches the spot ;
on that contingency I stake our chance of sucs
cess. If that fails, means more prompt and
decisive shall not," replied the stroller, with
emphasis '   '
" What mean you?" inquired Albert, as he
followed the old man through the trap-door into
the cellar.
Willie paused near the foot of the stairs, and
grasping Albert's arm, replied:
"Should we meet him, but two alternatives
remain;'he must'e, or we must."
"But I hate murder t" returned Albert,
with a shudder.  " I can give broken headsin
the heat of passion, or measure swords with my
adversary on equal ground; but to shed blpod
deliberately is abhorrent to -all my feelings.
Devise some other plan of escape."

those whom we may protect, and who require
our most strenuous and untiring efforts in their
aid. Think of Isandra ; think of the Lady
Eveline.  They are young, they are fair, and
hitherto have been hopeful; shall they be
abandoned to the miserable fate which seems to
stretch forth its arms to enfold them? No, no !
they must be befriended and rescued, although
a score of Mark Donhead's knaves perish !"
exclaimed the beggar..
"I feel the force of your reasonings," re-
plied Albert, "and though I have a strong de-
sire to avert bloodshed, I will no longer oppose
you.  Act as circumstances may require ; for
I am convinced that you have a deeper know-
ledge of these matters than I. That you are
other than what you profess to bel doubt not;
and that you have powerful motives for what
you do, must be equally true. Caprice, and
love of excitement alone, could not prompt.you
to brave danger and death; but I will not pene-
trate, your secret ; I will not tear' awayr the
mantle of mystery that envelopes you.  That
those'eyes of yours are sightless, I cannot well
believe. But it -matters not';' move on, l an
with yeu:--
Without making any reply, Strolling Willie,
pressed against the wall where the 'door was
concealed,; a -cold and damp currentt of air
rushed in from the cavern, nearly extinguish-
tagthe'lamp."
"Hark !" whispered Albert. "Ihear some
one approehing.'
"It must'be-Herbault," replied th  stroller,
pte pi g back from the-seeret passage.  "' Here,
takethd light and place -it upon the' earth,- be
aide yonder cask- He will think that Joachim
Caplet left it there, of that -some one has come

aperture.  He felt icy chills creeping over him,
and heard his own heart beating with unwonted
vigor.  He would have withdrawn his gaze
from the statue-like figure of the mendicant,
but he could not ; some resistless spell seemed
to rivet them upon the mysterious man. He
would have moved his limbs, and shook off the
trance-like power that bound him in its iron
chains; he would have looked up towards the
dawning skies of morning, but they were shut
out from his vision by dark and impenetrable
walls; he would have felt upon his forehead a
single touch of the balmy zephyr that kisses the
earth with the first streaks of daylight ; but the
cold and chilling damps rushing in 'from the
cavern, fell upon his face like the breath of the
angel of death.
The intruder advanced ; he evidently per-
ceived that some person had recently been there,
and the fact of finding the secret door open ob-
viously surprised him for a moment ; for he
paused an instant as if not quite decided in re-
gard to the propriety of proceeding, wiiout
first sorttinising the locality.  ring that
brief interval, the-stroller remained in-the .aan
stern and moveless attitude ; his =,right .hand
still clutchingf ,something- beneath :the tattered
doublet that covered his bosom.
Casside's breath seemed to be suspended,:
arid he made ;another strong effort to, tear his
gae' from the fired form of the oldmana.
The- ind vision of the individual in the-pas-
sage was of short duration; he c-ame - forward
with t a-quickFacid confident steps and instantly:
his-figure darkened the  aperture.  Willie bent
quickly fotrard.; his tight-hatd left his;dQublet
and   descended' with the celerity of thought,;
Albert saw a momeritary'glimmering of steel'.
heard a dell heavy blow followed by 'a hollow:
groan.  The icy spell that bound 'him  was
broke; it}no longer held his- limbs in horrible
bondag ;ritino -longer paralyzed- his :brain and.
fettered his faculties; it no'longer greeped1 hin

He stooped and took the lamp from the earth
and obeyed the summons. The stroller had
already passed into the cavern, and our hero
followed. '"-
-- "Close the door," added Willie, in a low
voice. "Press upon that part of the wall'at
your right, upon which are finger marks. There
that is right ; now we are ready to go on again.
Step softly, and all will yet be well. The. as-
sassin is powerless to do us harm; ,the pulsa
tions of his heart have ceased."
Casside looked up, and perceived that the
beggar was carrying the body of Herbault in
his arms ; but he made no- comment upon what
he had witnessed, and the strangely mated pair
threaded the labyrinth most silently. Although
of a bold at.d adventurous -nature, the young
man could not well repress feelings of anxiety
in regard to the results; he eQuld not help
picturing to himself the catastrophe that would
ensue, should they meet any of the followers of
Mark Donhead.
Presently they reached the banditti's place
of interment, and the mendicant laid his ghastly
burden down beside the new-made grave, which
marked the resting-place of the traitor. -
" A part of the danger is met and overcome,"
resumed Willie ; "but something yet remains
to be done; this body must be concealed."
" It must now be near morning," said Albert,
"4and but little time is left us for deliberation ;
we must think and act quickly. Ere long some
of the banditti will be astir." ,     "
. 'You speak reasonably," returned Willie ;
"but ewe must first consign this: clod to its
kindred clods. . There must be somewhere here-
abouts, apick and mattock, .which are used in
digging graves. We will remove a portion-of
the earth from, the remains -of this last sleeper,
and place near him this carrion to 'keep him
company.   Ah ! you remensber, perhaps,'that
once told you that life was changeful; now
reflect, and tell me if I was not right ?"
"You spoke like an oracle," replied Albert;
"but let that pass.  Let us attend to this awful
business with as much despatch as possible."
At that moment the sound of a bell 9ehoed

in heavy undulations through the cavern. Wil-
I lie dropped the mattock and turned a startled
look rpon his companion.
"It is to summon the band I" he said, in
answer to the inquiring glance of his companion.
"The burial of this carcase must be delayed
until midnight, and then we will give it .ps deep
a grave at it could expect under the circum-
- stances. a.las ! Herbault," he added, senti-
- mentally, "you were a villain in life, but I
bear you no malice now you are dead."
"Can you not think of some spot where this
piece of work may remain undispvered for a
day ?"
" That is the very subject upon which I am
considering; let me see ; ah! now I, have it;
but a few steps from here is just the place. I
must lift this poor rascal again. This way-.-
this way."
The beggar caught up the body and walked
hastily across the subterranean cemetery, and
stooping until he was nearly double, entered a
small passage only large enough to admit one
person at a time, and then in the position al-
ready named.    The stroller worked his way
along in the best manner he was able, -encum-
bered with his heavy burden, and finally deposit-
ed it upon the earth, and crept back again to
the side of our hero.
"Can you see any telltale spots upon me-?"
he asked, of the latter.
" Your doublet is stained," answered Albert,
in a low tone.
"I will be careful that no other eyes ever
look upon it," continued Willie.- " Now, my.
lad, put on a bold and cheerful front and let
us back to your quarters that you may join
the merry men of Captain Mark, at their morn..
ing meal,.as though nothing extraordinary had
happened."
Without fartherconversation they glided along
the silent arches of the sub-mundane corridor,
and -reached, without- accident, the -apart nent
from whence they had issued someitwo hours
previously ; where Wandering Willie shook
hands with Albert and parted from him.
Casside sat down upon his couch ; but he

W    HEN    they were' seated at the table,
.~ -Mark resumed ; " In a few days, you
will be permitted (providing your conduct gives
satisfaction) the liberty of the cavern ; but when
that time arrives, I warn you against meddling
with matters which do not directly concern you,
and especially to remain silent upon the subject
of Lady Eveline; otherwise, you will bring down
upon you the hatred of Godfrey Ridenger."
"One of two things is clearly evident," re-
joined Albert; "you either fear this Godfrey
Ridenger, or are, in some manner, placed in his
power."
"Fear him!" exclaimed the captain, fiercely,
striking his fist violently upon the table. "I
tell you, I fear no one ! Be less free in your
speech. Those words had they been uttered in-
the presence of others might have.- cost you
dearly."
"Speak without reserve, captain," added
Albert, sarcastically, "'we are alone."
The bandit chief looked fixedly at the imper.
turbable features of our herb, and after a little
time continued his discourse.
" We are meditating some bold--."'

"Robberies," suggested Albert, coolly.
Mark frowned and went on.
"We are meditating some bold movements,
which will require much skill and address ; and
I mean that you shall commence your career as
soon as possible, in order that we may not be
obliged to practise with you those precautions
which are always thought necessary with new
members of the band. We have heard a rumor
that some knights who were robbed in the for-
est a few days, ago, are about to make an at-
tempt to exterminate each and all of us, with
two or three score of men-at-arms. So you see
there is some prospect of excellent sport, in
which you may freely indulge in your favorite

affect you?"
" It puts me in excellent spirits.  Give me
your hand !" cried Albert, feigning to be much
elated, and favoring Mark Donhead's hand with
powerful squeeze. A lively conversation was
kept up between the parties until the morning
meal was despatched, when father David made
his appearance.

men to the field, your deeds would be hailed by
the applaudling shouts of the wondering multi-
tude. It is power that confers greatness upon
celebrated ~chieftains ; the majority is respected,
the minority is scorned."
"By St. John ! I never heard so many
wise sayings in the mouth of Peter Vidal be-
fore," rejoined Mark.  "Beware ! that philo-
sophical head of yours will yet carry you into
trouble."
With a sinister smile upon his hard, wiry
lips, Vidal opened the door and departed from
the monk's hut, his brain teeming with visions
of golden fiorins.
"If I should not have an opportunity of
speaking confidentially to-day, you may expect
to see me at the cavern between the hours of
midnight and morning, when we will devise

ieans to frustrate the villany oftVidal, and the
manly projects of the bandit chief," said the
monk.
' either conversation was prevented between
Elie two, by the authoritative voice of Mark
summoning them from their hiding-place.
"I'have attended'to the business which"was
uppermost in my mind,:r he said, " and now we
will to the, Silver Bell, to tire ourselves a little
relaxation-over Joachimi Oapet's best wine."
But few words were spoken by either par-
ties on their way to .the inn. Joachim Capet
met his visitors upon the threshold with his
usual urbanity of manner, and ran over his
usual catalogue of great names with accustomed
volubility. That he recognized Mark Donhead
snd the monk, there could be no doubt ; but
that he did not recognize Casside was equally
certain; for he had drawn the hood of his domi-
no close over his features.
" We would have a room to ourselves," said,
Mark, "and our holy calling will not prevent
us from tasting some of your-oldest and choicest
vintag'e." With bows and smiles the master
of the Silver Bell ushered the three monks into
the chamber which Casside had so recently visit-
d, and where he had passed some of the most
unliappy hours of his existence.
Wine was immediately' placed before them;
but Mark Donhead appeared ill at ease, and
aStt swallowing, hurriedly, a few cups of the
sparkling beverage, arose and abruptly left his

companions, saying that' he would return in a
ahort tiine.
Albert wag about to speak freely in regard to
the subjects in which he felt so deeply inter-
ested ; but a significantly gesture from father
David deterred him.
"This isno place to talk concerning impor-
tant secrets ; these walls have ears to hear and
tongues to betray us," whispered the monk.
'he .table had beef placed against the wall
near the spot where Albert and the stroller had
heard the 'conversation between the knight and
his squire, and the mind of the former naturally
recurred to-the subject which had then been
discussed. He felt an intense desire to meet
the person who passed under the assumed name
of Godfrey IRidenger, and provoke him to an
encounter, in order to do him such personal
harm as might most effectually prevent him
from carrying out his nefarious schemes in'rela-
tion to Lady Eveline. Knowing, as he now
did, the true name and character of this person,
he was fully conscious of Eiu power to exert a
strong influence in whatever direction he was
disposed to turn his attention. His armeaculd
indeed reach all over the kingdom, and crush
his- enemies with -scarcely an effort, with little
regard to their rank or condition.
While theseÂ°thoughts were passing through
Albert's brain, a heayy step was heard advanc-
ing, and presently the door wasthrown open.
A man entered, and the subject-of his medita-
tions stood; before him.

mination of a certain business upon which a few
trusty fellows of our fraternity had been sent.
I have always been reputed' a gallant gentleman,
and a devout admirer of dames and damsels."
"Who that knows the daring Godfrey Riden-
ger, will presume to .dispute his claims to gal=
lantry ?'' said the monk. "But pardon wy
want of hospitality ; here is' some of Joachim
Capet's best vintage. Let us drink success to
the pretty love adventure now fast hastening to
a happy consummation. You have doubtless
heard ere this that the proud maiden is already
caged ?"
" Yes, the pleasant news reached me some

fair one in the course of the day. But I fear I

GODFREY RIDENGER.

f

HEN Albert perceived that some one
was about to enter, he drew the hood
of his domino more closely about his face, and
when he saw the figure of Sir Hugh Spencer,
alias Godfrey Ridenger, he congratulated him-
self that he had taken that precaution. He
hesitated an instant, and seemed inclined to
offer some apology for his intrusion, and with-
draw'; but his eye resting upon father David,
put an end to his indecision.
" This is an  unexpected  pleasure, holy
father," said Sir Hugh, affecting a very res
peetful air.
It is as ,unexpected on my part as on
yours," replied the monk. "To put you out
of all uncertainty, this young man belongs to
the brotherhood, and you may speak freely be-
fore him; I will answer for his fidelity. The'
captain reposes great confidence in him. How
is it that you have returned so much sooner than
you expected ?"
"My movements have been influenced by
various'causes," returned Ridenger.  "But to
tell the truth, I was anxious to learn the ter-

she in consenting mood. As for my past gal-
lantries, they should be repented of, and never
repeated; and on the whole, I. think I would
become a sort of sober philosopher-a wise owl
to hoot at the failings and moral aberrations of
others. My good monk, there is nothing like
reform when one is sated with enjoyments, and
has a.constitution which is shattered by dissipa-
tion.  Upon my word ! I could sit down and
read you a good sermon extempore ; and if.
good, what matter where it comes from., We
must not look at the origin of things, but at
things themselves.  There was Solomon ; a
man reputed exceedingly wise ; but yet not wise
Enough to break off his follies in time to prevent
the consequences, save his poor body from aches
and pains, and his conscience from periodical
convulsions. 9 That celebrated sage did not dis-
cover that 'all was vanity beneath "the sun,'
until his debaucheries had rendered him mis-
erable, and no longer able to enjoy the sweets
of existence."
"Heaven obviously intended you for the
church," answered David.. .'
Heaven might have had such intentions,
but the whole thing was evidently a failure,"
added Sir Hugh, with a laugh.
" Perhaps not, perhaps not," replied David.
"It is hard to tell what a man will be, before
he gets through with life ; it is easier to tell
What he has been, after he is dead."
"It appears* that the exploits of 'a certain
Mark.Donhead are at this-time producing some
excitement in Dorsetshire, and other portions of
the country ; and it may interest you to know
that six hundred forms- have been offered for
that portion of his person situated immediately
above his shoulders--a, part, which, I fancy, he
would be loth to e ebange for even that sum,
although I much doubt whether it does not
tempt the cupidity of some of his merry
knaves."
"ILittle fear of that,"said the monk, quickly.
" Iquery whetherthere is one among them who
would betray him for twice that amount of filthy
lucre.
"'I will add that I have heard' there is some

prospect that the band will be harassed by a
strong body of men-at-arms," resumed Sir Hugh.
"However, I have other matters to engross my
attention at present ; I have fair lady to woo,
and I must prepare myself to appear in her
presence in a manner most likely to disarm her
anger. I must exhibit such a degree of contri-
tion as shall excite her pity ; I must be the
most penitent of men; the most self-condemned
of mortals ; the most humble of human beings;
more abject in my self-abasement-than the rep-
tile that crawls upon the earth. Yes, by St.
Simon ! there is but one way in which I can
appear before that peerless beauty ; and that
is, as a criminal, as an offender against the laws
that govern social etiquette,; as a violator of
the rules of human society ;- as one who has aout-
raged forbearance and common decency ; as one
adjudgedby the mouth of morality to be vile,
viler, vilest."
Sir Hugh Spencer pressed his hand thought-
fully toshis forehead and paused a moment.  He
then added, in muchthe same tone :
"But the Lady.Eveline has, in some    qar
sure, brought this upon herself. In ranks,and
fortune I was far above her when I first made
suit to her in the courtly words of a gallant
knight and a' courteous gentleman. To. tier
refusal, she may justly attribute this misfortune;
if misfortune it can be called ; and I'll be sword
the foolish maiden considers it as such. Bui#t
will be honorable, by the virgin, I will-be hon-
orable before Iam vindictive ; I will renew the
offers that she scorned in other days. She Ni
not--she dare not--do otherwise than accede tq
my wishes. I can raise her to a place of power;
whose heights will almost make her dizzy; ,and
I can crush her tq a depth of degradation, that
would madden her to contemplate even ii the
distance."
Godfrey   idenger uttered these words ener-
getically, and stamped upon the floor to give
them emphasis.
"Come, father David, fill this cup once more,
and.I will leave you.  That will do; long lfe
to you. I hope your companion is discreet;
if he is not, he had better be dangling from thq

tallest tree in Donhead Wood than be here."
And turning upon his heel, the friend, compan-
ion, and leader of banditti, strode from the
chamber.
"What think you of that, my friend ?" ex-
claimed David, when Sir Hugh had disappear-
ed4 "'Have not the last few moments given you
a deeper insight into the character of the second
in command ?"
a I acknowledge that they have ; but I knew
him- but too well before," said Albert.  "Al-
low inc to leave you for an instant; I will re-
turn directly."
"By no means whatever !" cried the Inonk.
"It 'is against the regulations concerning new
members.   Such an act would provoke the
anger of our worthy captain."
" It shall be mine to shield you from all
blame," returned Albert. "I am resolved ;
do not attempt to hinder me. I would not do
violence to one who has shown himself friendly ;
but I warn you not to lay your hand upon me
to detain me. I shall strike--by Heaven, I
shall strike! 'All the powers of -the infernal re-
giens, 'with Captain Mark at their head, could
not keep me here a moment longer. Give way-
E go !"
.Dashing the, monk from him, as though he
had been a mere child, the young man sprang
from the room. He closed the door after him,
and perceiving that it could be bolted on the
outsidedeliberately fastened father David in ;
then tJkowing off his domino, he passed on to
the chamber adjoining, burst it open with a blow
of hi. foot, and very unceremoniously entered.
Sir Hugh Spencer had just crossed the apart-
menit, and was looking from the window towards
the forest, when our hero made his unexpected
ady4nt ; the noise consequent upon the latter's
movements caused him to turn quickly towards
the intruder, who was careful to close the -door,
as though apprehensive that the object of his
wrath'would attempt to escape.
The knight started with surprise, And his
cheek flushed with indignation. Sudden as the
gleam of the angry lightning, Albert's sword
leaped from his sheath.

"Most villanous of villains ! draw and de-
fetd yourself 1"
Sir Hugh needed no second bidding ; he
drew his weapon from its scabbard, exclaiming :
" Presumptuous hind ! base born peasant !
this time you shall not escape me so easily"
"Boastnot-boast not, black-hearted wretchl!
but look well to yourself," returned Casside.
For a;fewseconds the two men fought with
desperate daring and deadly determination.
The frantic fury of the knight was met by
the cool and consummate skill of Albert. An
unguarded movement on the part of the former
left a portion of his person exposed, and instant
ly the 'latter's sword passed into his body,-in-
flicting as he believed, a mortal wound.
Sir Hugh staggered a few paces and fell to
the floor, which was soon stained with the blood
that welled from his side. Albert paused .not
an instant ; sheathing his sword, he ran from
the room, resumed his domino, and rejoined the
monk, before he had gone from his side five
minutes.
" In heaven's name, what mad freak have
you been guilty of now !" exclaimed father
David, pale with apprehension.
"I have' been doing what I shall ever cen-
sider it my duty to do, while my arm is endowed
with life and strength. I have punished a vil-
lain for his crimes; I have smitten one whose
evil deedea iave long evoked the vengeance of
Heaven," replied the 'young man.   *1 But
come," he added, "let us sit calmly down tb
our wine 'as 'though nothing had happened.
Good father David, let us drink long life'tom
to--anybody you will--Stolling Willie, -or
instance."
" It is -a wise thought," added the monks
"And since the deed is done, we must put a
good face upon the' matter. So here's a. very
long life to those who deserve to livi, and' a
speedy death to those who deserve to die."Ey
"Very good,' my worthy recluse ; a more
comprehensive health could not be quaffed. -'It
will be well for us to pretend to be a little heam

we hear any one approaching. And, by the

way, we may as well rattle the' drinking eups
somewhat, and strike the table to give a life-
like reality to the affair "
As wild and headstrong as you are, I per-
ceive that you are not entirely without pru-
dence," said the monk.    "And then," he
added, in a low voice, 'I hear the tread of
Joachim Capet.  There will soon be a tremen-
doug excitement at the Silver Bell. List ! he
knocks at the door-he repeats it !=-still no an-
swer-no voice says come in; louder and louder
fall the blows of mine host-no response-he
is out of patience-.-he will wait no longer-
the door creaks upon its hinges-he opens it,
and now for the grand discovery.".a--
It may readily be imagined' that our hero
waited the denouement with considerable inter-
est, being himself so intimately concerned in the
subject.  The moment the door was heard to
swing open, the voice of Joachim Capet was also
heard, uttering an exclamation of the most com-
plete surprise.
Casside and David immediately raised their
voices as though in hot dispute, thumped upon
the table with their fists, rattled the drinking
cups, and gave other appropriate indications of
violent controversy upon some polemical matter.
The words, "church, indulgences, eucharist,
holy sepulchre, virgin Mary, etc.," were vehe-
mently articulated, and it is feared in not a
very connected manner.  Capet, meantime, ran
to the head of the staircase and cried :
"Murder-thieves--asgassins !" in, a;stento-
nan voice.
Immediate   several persons were heard rush.
ing up the stairs to see what such dire exclama-
tions meant.  Claude, the squire, and Mark
Donhead were among the foremost.
" What in the name of all the martyrs means
this turmoil ?" cried the latter, as he passed
Capet in the passage.
"It means" answered Joachim, "that mur-
der most foul has been perpetrated at the Silver
Bell.",

Hearing the, excited voices of Casside and
David, the captain of, the banditti threw open
the door and looked in, supposing that the
trouble might be there ; but perceiving them
earnestly engaged in controversy, he turned in-
stantly and ran into the. next chamber, pre-
ceded by Claude, and followed by mine host.
The cause of the latter's consternation was now
fully apparent. Stretched at - full length upon
the floor, lay the body of Sir Hugh Spencer, in
a pool of blood. Claude Herminger knelt be-
side his master and felt his pulse.
"Life is not extinct," he said, and than pro-
ceeded to examine the wound in his side.
" It is deep and dangerous," he added;
" and the handthat dealtit knew well the use
of the sword. Joachim Capet, let strict search
be made for the murderer ; see that he doesnot
escape."
"This is wondrous strange !" muttered Mark
Donhead, assisting Claude to place the knight
upon a bed. "I would give a thousand florins
to know the perpetrator of this deed."
Without pausing to add more, or to hear any
rejoinder, the captain-ran quickly to the cham-
ber where our hero and the monk still remained,
and whose voices -could be distinctly heard
rising higher and higher.
"Fools !" thundered Mark. "Do you.not

has received a mortal wound !"
Albert and the monk turned a pair of amazed
faces towards the bandit chief.
"You confound me ! how did this happen ?"
exclaimed David.
"The foul ,fiend only knows !" rejoined
Mark, and instantly a new idea seemed to occur
to him. He gave the monk a stern and search-
ing look.
"Tell me, sir," he said, "has this young
man left the room since I parted from you an
hour ago?"

as usual, in the accustomed' place, and he was
not sorry to see approaching the old woman,
who had told such fine things concerning him
on another occasion ; for he believed a good
opportunity now offered to learn the particulars
in relation to the good fortune in reserve for
him.
* Elsie drew near.
Well, my good lad," she said, "I told you
that we might, perchance, see each other again.
Where is your sister?"
"She is at the cottage ; but I expect her
here soon," replied the boy.
Perhaps you remember that I made the
remark that I was seldom seen twice in the same
place, without I had strong reasons for my re-
appearance. I have things to say to you both
of vital importance; and what I say, Imust
say quickly, for there is no time to lose-the
voices are calling me another way.  Isandra is
in grewidanger ; designing men meditate much
mischief against her. Bit their plans must be
baffed.--their schemes must fail-their counsels
come to nought.  You are, a brave and active
youth, and must be the instrument employed to
have her from the evil purposes of bad inen,"
added Elsie, with an earnestness of manner that
eased Louis  to stave at her with astonishment.
"I know, wise mother," answered the lad,
"that Isandra.is unhappy, and that my father
has proposed a:husband for her who is detesta.
ble to her sight ; and if that is the fate from
which you are anxious to save-her, there is noth-
ing which I will not do to bring about such a
desirable event. Look i she is o6niing.1"
14It is to that intended marriage that I re-
fer  r esaumed the Sibyl; "and when Isandra
has joined us, I will speak more 'plainly upon
the subjecot.",
In a- short time the fair shepherdess stood
beside Elsie and Louis.
" This woman," said the latter to the maiden,
asaya , that'she.has something of importance to
communicate that concerns us'deeply.
"'Speak on, Xlsie," iaifl Isanda.
"I will," said the sibylla, solemnly; "for I
have come to adviseayou of the wicked art of

base and unscrupulous persons. I know 'this
man whom your father has selected to be your
companion through the journey of life ; I know
him to be so opposite to you in character, that
another could not be found so widely different,;
I know him to, be a man of.niany crimes, upon
whose head justice has set her reward."
"Do you mean Denis Wetzel?" asked
Isandra.
"Yes, yes! Denis WetzelI" returned Elsie,
emphatically.
"Then comfort yourself, good sibyl, for the
proposed'union will never take place," rejoined
the maiden, earnestly; "I will never consent
to bestow my hand on Denis Wetzel."
"Never consent! - Silly girl! you -know
little of the power of the man who has given
you the promise of so many golden flrirns.
Your consent will not have much to do with
the matter. Might can overcome right ; priests
can mumble ceremonies, even:though they fall
on unconscious ears. A plot is already- laid
for your abduction."
"Are you indeed speaking what you know?
or are those words but insane mutterings, hava
ing little or no meaning'?" cried Isandra, be-
coming very 'pale.
"I am speaking advisedly, calmly, rationally.
I weigh every word-~I know what I say, and
what I would do. I have not come hither bymere
chance,' but by design, with a settled purpose.
Listen to me -no 'longer as a man or woman,
but hear   n me asa responsible being. To-morrow
night isithe time fixed'upon to carry out 'these
nefarious schemes. Upon some idle pretext,
Peter Vidal-I will not call him your father-
will send you from the  cottage. You will be
et by several persons-delegated for that pu-
pose, and forcibly carried to the place which
Denis Wetzel calls his home, where a monk will
profane the marriage ceremony by repeating'it
in your presence ; thus 'making you the  wife of
a man whom 'you detest."
Isandra listened to these strange' declarations
witi s gereasing trepidation, and wag obliged,
when the-sibyl ceased, to cling to Louis for
support.

"I fear this terrible story is, true," said the
youth, embracing his sister aflotionately.
'"Too true, too true !" murmured the fair
shepherdess.
"}But your brother shall thwart this well-
devised scheme, if he has courage: and' address
enough," resumed Elsie.
"Tell me how it is to be done," said the
youth, firmly, "and I will do it, if it costs me
my life."
"Bravely spoken, my fine lad ! . the plan is
briefly this ; you must change places with your
sister, and be carried off instead of tier."
"How can that be'?" inquired Louis.
"After she leaves the cottage to-morrow
night, as agreed  upon, you must exchange
dresses. You are nearly of the same size, and
clad like a female, you might well be mistaken,
in the evening, for the one you would person-
ate.  This ,exchange of garments must take
place near the cottage; when completely array-
ed in'the maiden's dress, you will proceed on
the errand upon which she has been ordered by
Peter Vidal. When you are seized by the
rufians, you must pretend to be much terrified--
weep, struggle, and sometimes appear to faint ;
always being careful to keep your face closely
covered with your sister's veil.  You must exer
eise all your ingenuity, and keep up the decep
tion to the last. When the fraud is discovered
you must not be terrified at the scene whiel
will ensue. Denis Wetzel will, doubtless, b4
in a great fury; but I do not believe he will b
disposed to do you serious harm.' Do you un
derstand me perfectly'?"
"I do, if he does not," replied Isandra
quickly. "My mind grasps all tihe threads o
the tangled skein ; I perceive all the details o
the, subjects, so far as concerns the disguise o
Louis, and the instructions which are to gover
his conduct.  I will teach him how to act, an
wlat to say; I will see that in the matter o
dress he resembles me as much as one perso
can look like another ; and trust me all sha
be done with skill and promptness, and th
emergency met in precisely the way you desire
My intuitions are quick ; I have a clear percel

tion of what must be done, to make the artifice
succeed. -But proceed ; tell me what course I
shall pursue after Louis has left me.
"Having put on the garments of your brother,
return/ to the cottage and retire to bed with as
little ado as possible. When you reach the cot:
tage, if you perceive a man within, do not enter
until he is gone ; if not, enter boldly, as I have
said. Should you see a small bag upon the
table, or m your father's possession, know that
it contains five hundred forms in gold ; and
that it comes from Denis Wetzel, in payment
for a young and innocent maiden,"
"Your manner," rejoined Isandra, "assures
me of your sincerity. Your instructions shall
be implicitly followed. But I would ask one
more question; upon whose head will the anger
of my father fall, when he learns the deception
that has been practised ?,
"Not upon yours, not upon yours ; leave
that subject to other hands. God will, perad.
venture, raise up a friend to protect you.  He
clothes the lilies, and he cares for the sparrows ;
will he, then,'desert those who are of morevalue
than the lilies and the sparrows'? No, no I
Weird Elsie, in. her wanderings has not found
it so."
"And yet one more question'?" resumed
Isandra..
"Speak, daughter," said Elsie.

e    " I hope not-that is, I believe not," return

manner.  " A friend may be raised up to him,

clearly; and the voices that speak unto.me so'
often, admonish me that I must not live for my.

is not a selfish one ; a single selfish act would
'deprive me of my power ; the threads of des-
tiny would slip from my hands and be lost ; I
could ,not gather them up again. No, no; the
thread of my own life is not among those that
guide my wanderings, and direct my efforts.
Be assured tlkat I shall appear before you again,
when a feeble hand like mine can assist you ;
till then-'be content, nor expect me until you see
me." -
the monk, or Weird Elsie, as we have called
him,.'in this character, said no more, but direct-
ed his footsteps toward Donhead Wood, leaving
Isaadra and Louis to marvel at what' they had
heard, and to tremble with apprehension when
they thought of the future.
While the scene we have just been describ-
ing was taking place, Albert Casside still, con-
tinued, to all outward appearance, to be enjoy-
ing a most refreshing slumber. The bustle in
the adjoining room had subsided.  The wound
of Sir Hugh had been dressed and pronounced
of a dangerous nature, and he still continued in
a state that precluded the possibility of learn-
ing from his own lips for the present, the author
of his misfortune. The Silver Bell had been
made the subject of a rigorous search, by Joa-
chim Capet and Mark, but without throwing
any light upon the mysterious transaction ; so
they were obliged to' content themselves with
conjectures and vague speculations in regard to,
the afair-"
Capet averred that if a certain young man
had been there (whom he would not disgrace
himself by calling by name), he should have
very well known to whom to attribute the deed ;
for said youngster was of a temperament to
commit murder, or to perpetrate any enormity
that a human being could be guilty of.-
Upon being asked'by Donhead if he did not
refer to Albert Casside, he unhesitatingly re-
5

plied that'he did ; and had not spoken without
good reason.
"And the strongest of your reasons, doubt-
less, are those black and blue spots which I see
over and under your eyes, and upon various.
parts of your face," said'Donhead, with 'a mali-
cious smile.
"There is not," returned Joachim, "'such a
hardened wreteh among all. your fellows. I
never was handled so roughly during my whole
life ; he showered such a storm of blows upon
me that Iverily thought my last hourhad'eome ;
and when he.left me, I was such a shocking.
spectacle, that my own mother would' not have
acknowledged me' for her own' son. Among
gentle or simple; I never saw such a fiery and
impetuous youngster ; and though chary of hiS
words, his fists are always at one's 'service."
"In the case of Godfrey Ridenger," said the
chief of the banditti, " I think your rustic youth
must be innocent ; and it were indeed hard to
animadvert upon one, who, for aught you know,
is an hundred leagues from here. But to change
the  subject :  Are those two proud-looking
cavaliers, who lost their florins in the forest, a
few days ago, still your guests'?"
"I am momentarily expecting them," return-
ed Capet. "Their servants' brought.me- word
that they should pass the night here. The tine
that has intervened since they were here, they
have spent at Motcombe Manor ; and indeed
they were of the hunting party upon that occa-
sion when Lady Eveline 'so strangely disap-
peared."
" Now, Joachim Capet, you begin to interest
me," resumed Mark, earnestly. "If I mistake
not, those two cavaliers were of high rank ; and
I have a presentiment that we. shall yet hear
from them in a manner not agreeable. I wish
Satan had flown away with Yorick and his com-
rades, before they had' unluckily encountered
and robbed them in the forest: Have you learn-
ed by any travellers from that direction, wheth-
er these unknown gentlemen have interested
themselves in that affair of Ridenger's-the
vexatious abduction of the lord's daughter ?"

Travellers don't often escape without talking
more than they ought to, when Joachim Capet'
gets hold of them. I have good authority for

when the Lady Eveline was stolen, have inter-
ested themselves most deeply and seriously in
the matter ; and it is rumored, furthermore,
that it is by their agency that a reward of six
hundred florins has been offered for your head."
" It will cost whoever gets my head more than
that I" replied Mark, sternly. - "Let them
come, I say," and the robber chief played ner-
vously with the hilt of his sword. " But, Ca-

pet," he resumed, hastily, "we must be oau-
tious. This last act of daring, into which the
folly of -Sir Hugh has inveigled us, I plainly
foresee will raise a dangerous storm, whicliwe
must be prepared to meet like men. Be cir-
eumspect in your treatment of travellers; play
well the host. Preserve the important secrets
connected with the Silver Bell, as carefully as
you do the precious sands of your own life.
Let them once be whispered to the winds, and
the arm of our power will well nigh be broken.
Yes, I warn you to be discreet ; I am watching
you. Should your folly or your cupidity betray
us, remember that there are two hundred dag-
gers ready to draw your blood; and that te es-
cape the vengeance of the order, will be an at-
tainment utterly impossible.  So, Joachim Ca-
pet, let that fact be an everlasting admonition
in yourears."

F there was any sound under heaven that
could attract the attention of Albert Cas-
side, and endow arm and brain with activity, it
was the clashing of swords. For him there
was music in the ringing of steel blades ; a kind
of music which invariably affected him with the,
f ghting mania. Therefore, upon hearing the
noise of a contest in the ,ard, in front of the
inn, he incontinently leaped from the bed, and
Wntowards the scene of the conflict as fast
biy limbs could carry him ; oversetting, in his
impetuous course, several oficials of mine wor-
t: y host, Joachip Capet. But our hero did
y  perplex his mind about details ; he had an

yard like a young-ecot, which disdaining dollar

4rrived there, he was much lated to erceve
that thee was e. ecellent opportunity to i-
44ge in cut and thrust; for two perons were
engaged with one slender youth, who, unegual
to the contest, was rapidly losing his strength,
and yielding ground.

To informs the reader that Albert drew his
sword from beneath his domino, would be time
and words thrown away ; for knowing his hot
and headlong; temper, he would conelude at
once, without much reflection, that his first act
would be to whisk out his weapon in the leapt
possible space of time ; whieh was really the
case.
"Cowardly caitiffst " he exclaimed, making
hist blade flash merrily in the sup. "toes it

youth upon whose chin the down hbs scarcely

a furious lunge at Albert ; but he parried it,

bim at his length upon the ground. Hi p'cm

scoundrels were getting the best of the bargain,
and' I should soon have been entirely at their
mercy. Although you wear the garments of
holy mother church, you use the sword like a
true knight. This service I will not forget ;
and if it does not at some future tirpe re-act in
your favor, then you may set, -me down as an
uncourteous cavalier and an ungrateful gentle-
man."    -
The courtly manner in which the youth ut-
tered these words, declared him to be of some
consequence ; and there was an air of superior-
ity and authority ,about him which did not ill
become him, but sat easily and naturally, like
a garment whose first stiffness and awkwardness
has been lost by wear.
" Such a slight service as this, gentle sir,
merits not the kindly acknowledgements whiobh
you are disposed to accord, I were indeed a
churl, to allow two savage ruffians to murder
you," replied Casside.
" I know what is due. to gallantry,". added
the youth,  and how to be grateful for a kind-
. Here, take this ring and wear it fornmy
ae; I shall take it i, if you refuse. It may
_ltiw atply prove a powerful talisman to save'
jou 'from jour 'enemies, or to  bless your
riens."
With a bow, Albert took the ring which the
x   nman proffered him, and which he ,eared
to eet, lest he might wound his feelings, and
astil placed it uponthe third finger of the let
" Tv oblige you, courteous youth, I' accept
this pledge of your friendship; not as some-
thin  n any manner merited, but as an indica -
tdo11 of your own generous nature.",
At thadt  stant, Albert felt a rough 'grasp
upon his arm, and tuf'ning angrily towards the
intruder, he pejrceivea the scowling face of Mark
Don ieadl.
What nowI has tie foul fiend gotten pos-
session of you again ?'" the" said, in a voice of
suppressed anger.
Casside's. eyes flashed indignantly, -nd ad-
vagcing his 'face close to'the ear of the bandit
chief, he rejoined, in a hoarse and threatening
tone :

"Never presume to lay your hand thus un
ceremoniously 'upon me the second time ; for
should you, I swear by the holy cross, I.will
pass my sword through your body, although you
are surrounded by all your minions !"
Mark Donhead bit his lips, and quailed be.
fore the menacing glances of Albert.
"Beware ! remember who I am !" retorted
the former, in a voice subdued almost to a
whisper,  " But come," he added, taking
Casside's arm; " tifis is no place for wrangling.
We are attracting observation; we will adjust
our differences at some other time and place."
Our hero slowly and reluctantly permitted
himself to be= conducted into the inn. As he
passed over the threshold, the youth whom he
had assisted thanked him again, while at the
pae time a cavalier rode into the yard, whose
arrival appeared to give him much pleasure.
Upon seeing the two .together, Albert im-
mediately remembered them as being the iden-
tical persons who had passed the'night at t e
Silver deli, . in an apartment adjoining tat
which he had occupied, and between whom  e
had overheard, a conversation of some lengh,
relating to ,a robbery in. the bonhead -*od.
The younger of the two was obviouly the in-
dividual whom the elder had addressed as neph-
ew ; and the elder was consequently the' same
who had answered to the application of'uncle,
on the occasion referred tai

"You can have it without that trouble,"
said Casside, carelessly.. "I was -born of some

year 1806."     ,
"Bah I it isfalse-it is false!" cried Mark,
violently.  "No more fooling-no more fool-

"That is empty bravado ! a merecurrent of

meaning.
"I will lay a wager of an hundred forins,

placed on equal footing, faee to face,;and noth-
ing but our swords to decide -the matter, ,before
ten minutes have been counted upon the dial,; I

Mark Donhead, whohad been walking fiercely
up and down the room, now paused before Al-
bert,. and favored him with a long and penetra,
ting stare, in which ferocity, fear, and indaision,
seemed to be blended. His chest wosred coh-
vulsively,' he set his teeth hard "together, and
breathed like a tiger that wishes to spring upon
his prey,, but dare not. He then: threw, him-
self heavily into a chair and said hoarsely, and
with forced composure :
"I will not -accept your accursed wager P'
" Act your pleasure, captain," said Albert,
who appeared, to exercise a kind of fasqination
over the sanguinary monster. For-a short time,
there was a profound silence, in which .~pohead
sat contracting his brows,,and casting savage and
curious glances at our hero.
It is impossible to tell how this singular scene
might have ended,,had it not at that crsis been
interrupted by the entrance of a traveller and
his servant. -He was a person considerably .d-
vanced in life, whose exterior denoted, both
rank and (respectability. Iis manner was ab.
stracted, .and he took little or no notice of.Al.
bert and his companion, but setting himself
dejectedly, waited patiently for the appearance
of mine host: The attention of Casside. was
immediately directed towards .the new-comer,
and he gave unmistakable signs of being cen-
siderably interested in his appearance,; ;and,so
far as one could judge, appeared equally antis
not to be observed by the. object of his scrutiny,
The hood of his domino, which had 'bqenp
tially removed, he hastily adjusted, cone ang
nearly every feature of his face.
Mark Donhead smoothed the.f n "oi.r
forehead, and also began to honor the stranger
with prying looks, and obviously desired to

J   kachi  Capet not appearing, the servant,
who'*as ii livery, rang a small hand bell,
wti h had the effect to sumnmon that worthy
fdadtlbtmry. '
"Your humble servant, noble cavalier !" ox-
6laiied mine host.  "You are welcome to the
best house in Dorsetshire. The Cellar, f the
Silver Bell is stored with the choicest vintage ;
and some of it has been there half a century.

"Do you'happen to know that gentleman'2"
asked Mark, sullenly.
" I haven't that honor," replied-Albert.
" Neither do I; -but trust me, Jtoaehim Cape
will be likely to find out. The fellow will not
be happy until he knows his name and rank,"
added Mark.   "-One thing, however, 'to me is
quite obvious;Ie iS a 'person of consequence ;
and wh 'knows but a wise providence has
thrown him in -our' way, that you may have a
chance to try your hand at your new trade.
Now I should call it a fair commencement ii
the world, for-a youngster like you to begin
businesses sucha-respectable gentleman. Any
bungler may rob &amp; Comrumon person of his filthy
lucre, but it's not every tyro that has the priv.
lige of clapping his sword to the breast of a
real lord, -or a belted knight," continued the
bandit chief, in a sneering tone.
"I perceive,"returned his companion, "that
you always have an eye to business; that yon
are something 'of a philosopher, as well asa
famous chieftain ; that you are as ready to
count laurels as florins."
While Casside was making this rejoinder,
Joadhim Capet re-appeared ; whereupon Don-
head inquired how the cavalier and his- servtat
were mounted ; whether their horses were in
good condition; whether the housings tpoa them
were rich and costly, and several 'other things
which we do not now remember.
Joachim went on' to state that both mhater
awu man wetemounted upon beasts good4ndough

and housings were resplendent with gold had
silver.

Joachim, turning pale and looking fixedly at
Albert.
" It is your old friend-Albeit Casside,"
replied Mark, laughing at'Capet's consternation.
"Heart of the Madonna !  St. Peter and St.
Paul, and a great quantity of other saints, of
all sexes ! I had rather see Satan himself at
the Silver Bell, than this mad-cap, hair-brained
youth !" exclaimed the host, with much per-
turbation of manner. "He- will cut all our
throats, and murder the women and children !"
"Come, Joachim," said Albert, "go and
bring us a bottle over which the cobwebs have
been accumulating for the last twenty years,
and let us drink confusion to our enemies."
"If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not,"

replied Joachim, working himself towards the
door, whereupon our hero went through with
the interesting pantomime of cracking his skull,
which had the effect to subdue instantly all his
former objections. He hastened for the wine,
and while he was gone, father David once more
rejoined them. The drinking scene that fob-
lowed did not appear to be of the most com-
forting and happifying kind to Joachim ; who
seated himself as far from the table as possible,
and kept a most vigilant eye upon the motions
of our hero, expecting, unquestionably, to have
a bottle or some other missile hurled at his head,
or some violent demonstration made upon his
person.

his countenance continually, to discover, with-
out appearing to do so, the effect of his words-;
ana he could not doubt but the bandit was
studying more fully his character, and testing
his good faith in regard to the object of his en-
rollment in the band. He was shrewd enough
to conclude that the captain's careless manner
was wholly assumed, for the purposes above
mentioned, and - conducted himself accordingly.
He was quite sure that he had seriously provok.
ed Donhead, by-his recent interference in the
quarrel which had taken place, in the yard of
the inn, a short time before ; and it appeared
more reasonable to him to suppose that he was
only repressing his anger for the present, than
that he had entirely forgiven him his uninten-
tional offence.
Albert knew enough of the human disposi-
tion, to'understand many of its various phases,
and flattered himself that he could not be de-
ceived, even by the cunning arts of the bandit
chief. Disguising his own feelings, he con-
versed with affected cheerfulness upon different
subjects, quaffed his wine'with apparent ebjoy-
ment, and sustained his reputation, generally,

-as a care-for-nothing fellow, in a tnannef that
reflected great credit upon his power of self-
control. Mark was baffled in all his efforts to
throw him off his guard, and it is possible that
lis- confidence in his new ally, was, in- some
,measure, restored.. His good nature increas-
ed with his increasing cups, : and he even
went so far as to drink the health of'his intend-
ed bride ; a formality which was anything but
agreeable to Albert, who would much rather
have preferred to dash his wine into the-cap-
-tam's face than to be reduced, as he was, to
the alternative of swallowing it.
While matters were progressing in this man-
ner, father David was suddenly seized -with a
copious hemorrhage from the nose, and left them,
'as he said, to make an appliance of cold water ;
the only sure remedy for that complaint. But
the moment he was out of the tap-room, instead
of manifesting any concern -or annoyance from
the circumstance named, he quickly mounted
the stairs, and being intimately acquainted with
all parts of the Silver Bell, instantly sought
that particular apartment where he had reason
to believe the last traveller was accommodated.
. He listened a few seconds at the dooy, aid
then entered without knocking. The noble-
=looking guest, -was pacing the room with an air
-of the deepest anxiety, while the melancholy ex-
pression of his face gave ample evidence that
'orrow had not been a stranger to his breast.
The abrupt and unannounced appearance of the
monk seemed to surprise him, and pausing in
the middle of the apartment, he fixed a reproving
'and inquiring glance upon the intruder.  Fa-
ther David hurriedly closed the door, -and laid
'his finger warningly upon his lips.'
"I have come thus abruptly," said the monk,
in a suppressed voice, "to make an important
communication. I have but a moment to spare ;
it ipust not be known that I.entered this cham-
ber; and should chance throw me in our way
4uring'yodr brief stay. here, do not recognize
me, by word or look. Certain parties have laid
a plan to rob you in 'the adjoining forest, after
you have -left the Silver Bell.  No - personal-
olenice - will be 'offered you; but 1 whatever

moneys and valuables you and your servant
may have in your possession, will certainly be
taken, to the last farthing's worth."  ,
"Proceed," said, the traveller, as David
paused an instant.
"Is it necessary that you should resume
your journey before to-morrow?" asked the
friar.
" Imperatively," replied the gentleman.
"Be it so-be it so ; listen to me: I have
concocted a scheme in my own mind, by which
you may punish and baffle the designing knaves
of Mark Donhead. Feign to have with you a
considerable sum of money, and question mine
host about the safety of the roads, and the dan-
ger of robberies in the forest ; while at the
same time you admonish your servant to be-care-
ful of your portmanteau.- This line of conduct
will have precisely the effect desired ; and to
keep up the deception, procure a small bag, tnd
have it filled with copper,.lead, brass, and other
worthless articles, thus giving it the appearance
of great value.  This bag you need not fhe very
careful to keep entirely out of sight ; !aula after
yourself and servant have mounted, it might
very much favor the object in view if youshould
order him, in a- suppressed voice,. yet -load
enough for by-standers to hear, to hand you the
bag of florins, for you fear to trust him with it.
You smile, sir; I-perceive you enter into the
spirit of my proposal."
"I do, holy father ; I commend your ingenu-
ity, and will followsyour instructions to the let-
ter," rejoined the stranger. "The boldness of
Mark Donhead is becoming insufferable.  eavy
robberies are of daily occurrence. To disap.
point the cupidity of the ruffian in the nmanner
-which you propose, woulk really give .megreat
pleasure. Although you are a stranger :$ome,
the earnestness of your manner, as wellas the
garb you 'wear, assure me of your good faith.
L thank you;forithis. warning, and, twil trust
yolr integrity implicitly."
"Remember, my lord, or whatever yourditle
may be; that you are not to recognize Â°nmo should

I will also;add, that in giving you i-rng,

f    ARK    DONHEAD      resumed: "You,
Joachim Capet, must be sure to learn
when this gentleman intends to leave the inn ;
and having ascertained that particular item, do
not neglect to advise me of the same.  Father
David, Casside and myself will be enough for
this job ; we will station ourselves in the forest
at a proper time, and in a proper place, and
await his coming. While one of us takes care
of the servant, our young friend shall perform
his first robbery on the king's highway."
Albert did not demur at this arrangement,
and the captain and the monk proceeded to
give him very minute instructions concerning
the part he was to act, especially against awk-
wardness in his first attempt ; they assured
him that his language must be courtly and
civil when he demanded the nobleman's money,
and that he must not degrade himself by low
and vulgar expressions ; as his reputation de-
pended very much on the skill and address with
which he conducted his first enterprise.
While the worthy pair were imparting these
useful hints and practical admonitions, Albert
could not but observe that Mark was watching

You say-that this nobleman, for such he must
be, carries his florins in a large bag ?"  .

favored with a glimpse of the same ; and he is
of the opinion that its contents would be suf-

with befitting firmness,; "and I must endeavor
to acquit myself creditably,"
"Of course; you must make a grand effort,

As 'the parties moved in the direction indica-

menacing motion with his weapon.
Without farther remonstrance, the nobleman
took the bag from his saddle-bow, where it was
partially covered by a portion of his stress, and
threw it at Albert's feet, saying, contemp-
tuously :
"Young man,.I hope you will some day

As our hero bent to take the bag from the
ground, the hood of his domino unluckily slip-

caught a glimpse of his features, and uttered an
exclamation of painful surprise. The young
man hastily replaced his domino, waved his
hand to the man whom he had robbed, and re-
joined father David, who had been watching
the scene with much interest. A moment after,
Mark Donhead, who had prevented the servant
from going to the assistance of his master, also

4IILP ON the ensuing night, Albert'awaited in
this cell the expected appearance of the
stroller, with considerable' anxiety.  That sin-
gular'pe'sonage c.eame' a little earlier than on
previous occasions.  He, found our 'hero' much
-dejected, and more'than ordinarily excited by
soe recent occurrence. "But Wandering Wil-
1i6 appeared the- same ; there was no change in
hismanner, or in his' dress; .the same impend-

Intentions.  It was in vain that he addressed

at the first, it is a thing I like not ; but as we
have commenced it, it must be conducted firmly
to the end."

"Very 'true," said Willie ; " what is begun
must be finished, and it is now our painful duty
to consign earth to earth, and dust to dust, pr-ay-
ing that God may take care for the rest."
Casside and 'the stroller then proceeded to
the place of interment; the former held in his
hand the dim light, while the latter, with 'piok
.and spade, removed a portion of theearthfroin
the' recent .grave.  Standing there, beneath
those gloomy. arches, with such mournful'ime-
mentoes of mortality around-him, Albert cuuld
not'but reflect upon the mutability of human
affairs, ind feel-that life *as indeed a seasot*f
vicissitude and pain. ' The "feeble scintillations
of the lamp called up fantastic shadows. and
shaped grim monsters upon the rugged rocks and
overhanging' -walls.'
His own fancies were as wild and flifugl as
those pictured around him'by the faint eflbrts of
the glimmering 'lamp to overcome the surround-
ing darkness.  Meantime, the stroller la edo
industriously, and hollo*ed out a space in which
to deposit the mortal remains of ierbault.'
"It will matter but little, if it is not very
deep and wide," said Willie ; "and his slum.

bers will be just as sweet, as though he were
encased in a gilded cofin."
Theybodyof Herbault at length was brought
from the spot where it had been secreted, laid
into the ground above some -of his own handi-
work, and the kindred earth was thrown upon
him.-
Albert felt truly thankful when this disagree-
able task was completed, and the ghastly figure
of the executioner shut forever fromsight. The
mound was made to assume its former appear-
ance, and the implements that had been used
were returned to their accustomed places. Each
of the"two men experienced sensations of awe,
when they turned from the spot where so many
husian bodies had found room to mingle with
their kindred elements.
"{Now," said Albert, pausing in the corriddi,
when they had walked some distance, "I would
see Lady Eveline; and if you have any power
to Conduct me to her presence, I entreat you to
do so."
"No no ! that must not be thought of!" re-
plied the stroller.  "The danger attending
such a step is too great."
"Old man, I care little for danger. You
cannot change 'my purpose," rejoined Albert,
flhnly.
t'But you forget, my good youth, that I
also incur a portion of the danger'? It' is true
that you may value your life lightly, but it does
nut*follow as a consequence that I set the same
loc estimate upon mine," returned Willie.
"To all outward appearance you are the
most wretched of 'human:'beings'!" exclaimed
Albert, contemptuously; "and yet you cling as
tenaciously to life as the young, the fair, and,
the hopeful."
Selfish young man !"- retorted the beggar.'
"Is this, then, your return for kindness con-
ferred ? are these the thanks you bestow fo my
ervices ? is this your gratitude to an olA man,
who has already incurred deadly peril"for your
Pardon me, good Willie! my impatience
and impetuosity make the utter 'things' which
are 'not 'discreet, and which'may cause me fo ap-

pear meanly selfish ; but at present, as you are
aware, I am not -acting for self, but risking life
and fame for others., If there is any possible
way by which you can procure me an interview
with Lady Eveline, you will confer upon me
the'greatest possible favor, 'and lay me under
an obligation which I shall not consider repaid,
until the debt of nature itself is cancelled."
"One great difficulty which stands in the
way of your desires, is, that the apartment of
this damsel is beyond the places where many
of the banditti sleep; consequently, in going
there, we shall be obliged to pass them; which,
on the whole, cannot be considered a very plea-
sant undertaking."
" I confess, friend Willie, that that is an
objection worthy of consideration; but I am
prepared to incur the risk consequent upon the
undertaking, providing you' feel disposed to
share it with me'; or, if you prefer, give'me
such instructions : that I' may go unattended,
and suffer in' my own person (if need be) all
the penalties of discovery."
The stroller rnused a moment, as if weighing
all the circumstances of the case, and then an-
swered:
".I am always 'willing to dare danger, where-
there is a prospect of success; but I am not on#
of that kind who act without forethought, and
endeavor to exeedte plans before they are' well
matured.  In regard to your going alone;' n;
instruction -which I:can give, will enable you to
do so., And now tell me, my lad, candidly, if
much real good would'result from 'an intervidW
with this high-born maiden ?"
"She is, no ,doubt," added Casside, "'the
subject of the most'painful uncertainty and 'tor
turing apprehension. A 'few words from nie'
might remove a portion of her anxiety, andtlift
the' heavy burden of terror from her'hed.
This gentle' damsel, good Willie, is most 'ear
to me; and the sorrows that distract her bosoni
are shared by me, and render my oin life
wretched."
"Shelh things are'very strange," resumed the
stroller, '" but no doubt they ate natural and'

for a-considerable distance, ,each vieing with the

stealthiness of their movements. _{

"Perhaps your instincts have failed you for
once," replied Albert.
"I trow not-we shall know soon-it is very
important that the passage should be found,
because it leads to the place where the fair cap-
tive is immured."
Willie then placed his hands upon the walls
and felt his way carefully along ; while Albert
followed him, awaiting, in the greatest suspense,
the welcome announcement of the expected dis-
covery.
"JHere it is," said the. stroller, at length,
when Albert was beginning to despair of suc-
cess.
"Instinct forever !" said the latter.

" I am not the person to come so far on a
fool's errand, I assure you; I always look ahead,

CIE, time approached which seemed des-
tined to prove an important epoch in the
life of' Isandra Vidal.  She experienced much
an ity and many. trepidations of spirit in re-
gard to the events - about to transpire.  She
feed not only for herself, but for the'safety of
Louis. The sudden appearance of Weird" Elsie,
and the singular interest which she manifested
l these iueivphases of-her existence, had a ten-
'dey   itoimystify her !niid-not aÂ°little.  Why
h "rthatinexplicable personage presented her-
dolj at iich a crisis? What earthly object could
she have in frustrating the designs of'the man
whom she knew as Denis Wetzel? Whence
came her knowledge of his character and de-
signs?  Was there any secret tie that bound
Elsie to Wetzel; and had the former really any
power to aid her in an hour of extreme need ?
Queries of this nature floated continually
through the brain of the gentle shepherdess;
but she found herself unable to arrive at any
definite' conclusion in regard to them.  Some-
times she was half inclined to believe that Elsie
was a mad woman, and no more than that ; and
had merely given utterance to the disconnected

and incongruous imagery of 'her own distorted
imagination.- But when she reflected -more
maturely upon the details of the last interview,
she could not consistently question her sanity;
her manner was rational and impressive, her
words well chosen, and her earnestness 'quite-
apparent..
Isandra had promised to follow the, instrue
Lions of lElsie, and she adhered religiously to
the same. -She had discu4sed 'the matter fully'
with Louis, and the youth' had entered with
spirit and determination, coupled with prudence
and sagacity, into her plans and purposes' It
was conceded by both, that their father's maing
ner indicated that something unusual was going
to take place. His air was abstracted, his brow
clouded and thoughtful, and his replies to ques-
tions abrupt and impatient.
As the night approached, his agitation evi-
dently increased ; and Louis observed him more
than once casting troubled and half-regretful
looks at Isandra. The latter felt a natural
quickening of the pulse when she perceived that
the hour had arrived which was to test the prac-
ticability of ilsie's schemes.

"handra," said Vidal, suddenly, in a voice
not altogether calm, "youmay take this pack-
age and earry it to our neighbor, Michael Hoff-
land; and tell=him that I attended to the mat-
ter as well as I could."
With a trembling hand the maiden received
the package, looking inquiringly into her father's
face as she did so. _iVidal instantly averted his
eyes and turned from her, and with an unutter-
able feeling of sorrow, the young girl prepared
herself to execute this pretended commission.
When she had done so, she-left the cottage and
was joined by her brother, who was awaiting
her -at a short distance. The garments which he
was to wear on that occasion had been previous-
ly conveyed to the spot, and Louis had already
partially arranged his unaccustomed toilet, and
only needed the dexterous. and more experienced
hand of Isandra to render it quite complete.
The maiden affirmed that said garments fitted
him to a charm, and in fact did not ill become
him. With true feminine skill and taste, she
attended to those details, which, though they
seemed unimportant to Louis, when taken alto-
gether had much to do with the general effect.
The lad's locks were quite long, and by the
ready fingers of Isandra, they were arranged in
a highly creditable way.  She then gave him
such instructions in regard to his deportment,
manner of wearing a veil, etc., as she thought
would be useful.
All these preliminaries were, not effected
without much effort on the part of our heroine.
A full realization of the season of trial which
awaited both him and her, had a deeply de-
pressing influence upon her. Although she
shrunk from the proposed alliance with Denis
Wetzel, her own desire for safety did not cause
her to selfishly forget the danger to which Louis
was exposing himself to save her. - Her affec-
tion for the lad made her painfully anxious in
regard to the result. The manner in which
Elsie had referred to that subject, had convin-
ced her that the risk to be incurred-would not
be slight.-
But Louis was firm in his determination, and
embracing him most affectionately, the fair shep-

herdess invoked the blessing of Heaven upon
the enterprise, gave him the bundle, and with
an agitated breast saw him depart to encounter
he knew not what.
The moment the youth disappeared, she sank\
upon hei knees, and prayed fervently, humbly,
and tearfully, for the protection of God ; that
he would so surround him and lyr with his pro-
tecting providences, that evil men might not
bring them to shame ; that his- fatherly hand
might be so stretched out over them, that the
devices of.the wicked might fail;,that his great
love would raise them up friends to be near
them in every emergency; that his wisdom
might guide their footsteps always, and be to
them as a wall of fire by night and a pillar of
cloud by day.
Isandra arose from her knees;. she felt calm-
er and stronger; the angel of hope whispered
more tangibly in her ears-she spoke more con-
fidently of the joys of the future, and smiled more
benignantly upon the face of the humble maiden'.
With eyes still wet with the dewdrops of the
soul, she proceeded to fulfil the rest of her in-
structions. It was not altogether a genial task,
but supported by a new-born strength,'she at-
tired her person in the garments of her bother.
Twilight had passed, the moon was up, and
the stars were softly gleaming, when Isandra
had completed the change and was ready to re-
turn to the cottage. She entered without hesi-
tation just as Elsie had directed, and passing
through the room where her father was sitting
abstractedly, with his elbows upon the table,
and his head resting upon his hands, sought the
little apartment where Louis slept. Vidal did
not alter his ?osition, or notice her ; a circum-
stance for which she was thankful, for she felt a
little awkward in her new dress.
Isandra did not retire, but awaited farther
developments with an intensity of suspense
which cannot be expressed. Presently she
heard some one knock, and the stern voice of her
father bade the applicant enter. The maiden
.looked anxiously through an interstice in the
partition -and saw a man enter and place a bag
upon the table before Vidal.

".don't you know enough about women to
know that all that comes natural?" rejoined the
oher,- sharply.  "There's no deception about
those demonstrations, for the girl really fears
him, as she does Satan."
"Well, she'll soon learn that tears, and out-
cries, and swoons, wont avail much. Why,
bless you, she's at the cavern before this time !
There '11 be a nice job for father David, when
she gets pacified a little," added the man.
1tEush !"  said Yidal, striking  his hand
heavily ulion the table. " It isn't best to say
much about it; she is a thousand times too good
for him; I sometimes regret what I have done,
for it's Satan's own' work."
Iandra, who distinctly heard this conversa-
tion, felt a deadly chill creeping over her frame,
and lipteaed eagerly to every word.
-" ])ut come," resumed Vidal, "it's too late
in the day to be guilty of the ftlly of repen-
tance. , Let us count these florins, and see if
Wetzel has kept well his word. There is. a-
set .draw up to the table."  The man obeyed;
aid'Vidal with alacrity untied the bag.
" Money," he observed, moralizingly, "is
a grqt a#odyne rfor-a nervous conscience-; and
I shouldn't wonder," he added, with-a smile,
"if the contents of this hag should iput mine to
sleep for a long time; it looksfat and-inviting.;,
I   le empty its contents upon the table."
Ahe cgprse and sordid features of Peter Vidal,
li cited up with anticipation;. and his hands
shoek with expectationu s he inverted the bag.
Isa Ora heard a, heavy metallic sound, and then
there was an interval of the deepest. silence..

"By the hWly eross! what vile tieh is: this !"
vociferated Vidal, choking'with wrathh,
The man who had brought the bag, stayed at
the contents of the same in mute , ader.
"Your mater has fooled ,me i I "was an
idiot to trust him !" added Peter, with incre*-
ing vehemence.,
"Trash!, not worth a. single form !" ex-
claimed the messenger, putting his hand upon
the worthless, pile, which consisted ,of" brass,
lead, copper,, and other quite valueless metals.
Vidal sprang to his feet, beat upon his breast,
tore his hair, foamed at the mouth, and leaped
about the room like a madman, uttering impre-
cations upop the head' of Denis Wetzel, too, pro-
fane to repeat.
"This is one of the strangest things I ever
knew," observed the messenger,, scratching his
head.
Instantly the fury of Peter found vent upon
the unlucky bandit ; he darted upon him, and
administered such efficient blows as soon stretch-
ed him beneath the table.
"Go back, to your accursed .villain of a-
master !" he thundered, " Tell him I will pay
back this trick with interest; that I will have
my: revenge"; that I will hang him-that I will
hang you all ! I will havemy daughter, Ire
shall give her up, if I have to apply-to the king
himself for justice !"-           -
"Justice !" cried the bandit contemptuously,
getting upon his'feet; "if you had justice, you
would be   hanged, quartered, and burned !
Take the advantage of a fellow, will you !, Take
that, you avaricious old thief !" he added, hurl-
ing -a three-legged stool at Vidal with such force
and precision that he was -prostrated, in turn,
'and rendered incapable of main any=farther.
immediate hostile demonstrations; while thp
missile, whose inbmntum" was not wholly re-
tarded by the concussion, kept on, and passed
out of the window, making a tremendous clatter,
having the effect to agitate DIandra with addi'
:tional terror.
The bandit, not thinking it prudent to stay,
to -triumph over, his fallen enemy, 'contented
'himsefby shaking hisfistat him as he left the

cottage and admonishing him to lie there until
he could learn better manners, if it was forever.
Isandra beheld this scene without daring to
leave the room, and with emotions of fear to
which such occurrences would naturally give
rise. Leaving the cottage and its inmates, we
will now follow the fortunes of Louis. He had
gone but a short distance after parting from our
heroine, before he was seized by two men who
proceeded to place him on horseback.- The
brave youth did not forget his instructions, but
screamed and struggled, and exhibited every
sign of terror. He found the swooning part the.
most difficult to perform, inasmuch as in a feign-
ed state of unconsciousness he would be in dan-
ger of losing his equilibrium and getting a fall;
but he managed the matter so adroitly, that
the two bandits had ample warning of what was
going to occur, and so supported him while he
made a very respectable faint, which lasted in
.      duration some ten minutes.-
"She's gone qnite off," said Yorick, who
with Dick Strow had been delegated to perform
thisimportant service-
" Well, hold on to her," said Dick. " Cap.
tain Mark would never forgive us if the girl-
should get a tumble."
Presently Louis began to manifest symptoms
of returning life, and thought it would be to. his
credit to favor them with a few hysterical
screams, which would not have done discredit
to the lungs of the most terrified damsel under
heaven.
"What a stunnin' voice she has !" cried
Dick.  "A few more screams like that will
unroof my head ! If it's all the same to you,
ma'am, I wish you'd shriek on a lower key."
"And without meaning any offence," added
Yorick, " if you would manage to set up a little

" Take me back-take me back !" cried
Louis, frantically, in a voice not quite so soft
as Isandra's, but as soft as he could make it.
"We should be werry happy to please you,
young woman, but our orders are strict, and we
must' follow 'em, even if you cry yourself into
convulsions, and have the tantrums twice as
bad."
When the lad perceived that he was being
conveyed into the depths of the forest, he began
to entertain certain vague suspicions, and to be
the subject of uncomfortable misgivings in re-
gard to the place of his destination. Finally,
Yorick and Pick stopped at a lonely spot, which
proved to be the entrance to the cave of the
banditti ; and the youth could no longer have
any doubt in regard to the hands he had fallen
into, but was not yet inclined to regret the step
he had taken ; for he reflected that he might
be the means of saving his sister from  a fate
worse than death. He felt a cold and sieky
foreboding when he entered the subterranean
abode, and the stone that concealed the-entrae
moved back to its place. Who would be his
friend in that foul haunt of robbery and crime?
Who would interpose to save lfn from the anger
of Denis Wetzel, when the trick became mani-
fest ?  What could he hope -from such men as
those with whorn he was now dealing ?
Agitated by feelings like these, he was to-
ducted onward through some of the variuan
winding of the labyrinth, and finally stood in
the presence of the personage whom' he reog
nized as Denis Wetzel.

VORICK and Dick Strow withdrew, and
J assuming as conciliating an air as possible,.
Mark Donhead advanced and attempted to take
Louis by the hand; but remembering his in-
structions, he positively refused to permit that
liberty ; still keeping the veil drawn closely
about-his face, he recoiled from the approaches
of the bandit, evincing, so far as he could, every
evidence of repugnance and timidity combined
"I have sent for you," said Mark, "to make
you my wife. -Here you shall reign like a
queen; two hundred men. shall be your sub-
jects and servants. You'have only to command,
and your slightest wish will be obeyed. Here
I am absolute ; but I will share my power with
you. Your father knows me, and he has given
his' consentand approval to this step. It will
be useless for me to attempt to conceal from you
longer who I am ; I am he whose name you
have so often heard. My name and exploits
are famous ; but Satan himself is never so bad
as he is painted. I am Mark Donhead-the
captain of banditti! The future before you is
not so dubious as it might seem at first thought.
Here you may live in afluence and ease.. As

a husband, I shall be considerate and indulgent;
you will share my wealth, but not my crimes-
if crimes they may be called. It will evince
the most good sense on your part to leave off
sighing and crying, and submit toÂ° your lot like
a rational maiden. There is much true philo-
sophy in submitting gracefully to what you can-
not evade ; and this marriage, I assure you, is,
inevitable. The ceremony will be performed
immediately, and you will remain here until all
is in readiness. A few of my followers will be
admitted' as witnesses of the rite, and the monk
who will officiate, is now in the cavern."
The bandit chief ceased speaking, and Louis
offered no reply, not at that time deening it
prudent-to trust his voice, fearing it might be-
tray him. Being left alone, he passed the time
in reflections of a nature not very flattering to
his future prospects. The name of Mark Don-
head was familiar to his ears ; he had heard of
his innumerable robberies, and his character was
associated, in his mind, with all that. was cruel
and terrible. Common report spoke him vin-
dictive in disposition, and violent in his sudden
outbursts of passion ; and he naturally dreaded

THE SILV

the finale of the present scene. He had not yet
traced out any definite method of making known
the fraud which he had practised; but that the
whole would soon transpire, was now fully ob-
vious.
After the lapse of about an hour he heard
several persons approaching, and knew that the
ordeal which was to test all his 'firmness, was
indeed at hand. Mark Donhead entered, fol-,
lowed by father 'David, Albert Casside, Yorielr,
Dick Strow, and half-a-dozen others.
"My honorable intentions towards this maid-
en," said Mark, "are known unto you all,
gentlemen. I have formally proposed to her
father for her hand, and have received his full-,
est assent. I now intend to wed her on the
spot, and desire all present to be witnesses of
the legality of the marriagee"
"1The damsel, of course, consents to this ar-
rangement 7" said father David, inquiringly.
" Unquestionably," replied Donhead; "but
her agitation and embarrassment, which are
quite natural to the novel position in which she
finds herself placed, will prevent her, as you
perceive, from giving the fitting responses ; but
that will make no material difference. You can
make the contract just as strong, even if she
utters not a word. Come, -gentle shepherdess,
all is ready, and I am impatient to be made the
happiest man in Dorsetshire."
Donhead advanced and took Louis by the
hand, while the monk gave Albert a sly glance.
"1The gentle damsel is greatly abashed ; be
not so urgent, captain; allow her a moment or
two in which to recover her equanimity."
",When the ceremony is fairly over, she may
have as much time as she pleases for that pur-
pose. But upon my honor, I cannot now ad-
,mit of any delay. Come, my queen, no more
whimpering and tears ; let me cast aside the
folds of this envious veil, that your beauty may
astonish and dazzle the eyes of all present, and
mine most of all."
Knowing that the denouement must come'
sooner or later, Louis made but little resistance
to. the removal of said " envious veil," when all
eyes were indeed "astonished," but not "daz-

zled," with the face that was presented to view ;
for the youth's features by constant exposure to
the sun, had become very much embrowned,
and somewhat roughened, resembling but little
the soft, downy skin of Isandra.
The complacent air of Mark ,Donhead van-
ished with the quickness of light, and his fea-
tures grew darker than the clouds of midnight.
At first, the blow seemed to stun him, and he
could not fully realize the deception which had
been practised upon him. The storm was
about to burst in all its fury, when father David
threw the book which he held in his hand at
Mark's feet, and exclaimed, in as angry a voice
as he could assume :
"Captain Mark, this is a miserable trick !
and if you think we shall be amused at it, you
are much mistaken I"
" It is infamous !" cried Casside, springing
forward and shaking" his fist in Mark's face.
"We did not come here to be fooled, sir ; but in
good faith to witness a marriage ceremony, and
nct to be laughed at and mocked in this con.
temptible manner."
"Ay, ay I" added the monk, with increasing
energy, and gesticulating violently.  "You
may think it a very fine joke to smuggle a boy in
here, dressed up like a woman, in order to make
me and others appear ridiculous ! It's a dis-
grace to the priesthood !"
Yorick, Dick Strow, and others, seeing father
David and Casside so much excited about the
matter, began to think that a sorry trick had
been played upon them also, and showed their
displeasure by chiming in with the two latter in
a very decided way.
Donhead recoiled a few steps, and his coun-
teiance grew blacker, as he realized more per.
feotly, that he was becoming the centre and
focus of the foul words and indignant looks of
all present-.
"Stop your infernal chatter, you confounded
idiots I" he exclaimed, stamping upon  the
ground like a maniac. " This ;is no work of '
mine. Peter Vidal has deceived' me. Bring
Herbault I run for Herbault ! and let him strike
off this young rascal's head as quickss possible

and Donhead: proceeded to question Yoriek and
Dick Strew, on the manner in which they had
performed their part in this rather curious busi-
ness. They afirmed, that they went to the
spot to which they. had been directed, met the
person whom they expected to meet, and acted,
as they supposed,. precisely in accordance with
their instructions-; not having the - remotest
idea that paid individual would turn out to be

Now our hero *as :a strict lover of justice,
and he straightway endeavored to act towards
the parties with entire impartiality. He gave
Vidal.a blow under the left ear,- and Mark a
buffet in the left eye. When they had recov-
ered their feet again, he flattened the nose of
the former by a second punisher upon that or-
gan, and knocked out ,a front tooth for the lat-
ter- by placing a pain-killer upon that interest-

"We will bind them both, and then return to

out fear, that, the assertion can be proved false,
that your noble name has never been disgraced
by those who bear it."
"Such words are useless," returned the
nobleman, sorrowfully.  "My griefs cannot
be so easily assuaged. I know what you pro-
bably do not ; I have knowledge of that which
makes me wish myself in the tomb of my an-
cestors, mingling quietly with the dust of past
generations. But enough of this painful theme ;
can I not accompany you whither you are now
going, and share the danger, should there be
any? "
" Bf'no means, my lord ! it is not to be
thought of. Skill will serve us on this enter-
prise better than strength. Should we not re-
turn at the expiration of an hour, conclude that
we have failed, and provide for your own safety
and hers," pointing to Isandra.
While the monk was conversing with the two
persons referred to, Albert found opportunity
to whisper a few words to the fair shepherdess,
and to encourage her in the best manner that
he could.- He then followed father David, who
had proceeded to open the secret door which
connected with the cavern, having first provided
himself with a light. They passed hurriedly
through the intervening apartments, and were
soon in the subterranean labyrinth. They kept
on without accident until they reached.the cell
which Albert had hitherto occupied.
" Enter here, and stop a few moments," said
David, " when Strolling Willie will join you,
and conduct you to the place where the Lady
Eveline is held in captivity."
Casside did as he was directed, and after the
lapse of ten minutes, the stroller made his ap-
pearance.
"I have come," he said, "to take the place
of the monk. I-know what is to be done,:and
we must be expeditious in our movements."
"As expeditious as you please," replied Al-
bert. "Lead on."  Without farther conversa-
tion, Wandering Willie threaded once more the.
intricacies of the way which had cost them so
much anxiety.and trouble on the previous night.
They met.no one in the passage,.and ina little

'while the door of Lady Eveline's prison was
thrown open.
Casside ran forward and tenderly embraced
the fair occupant, who manifested the utmost
joy.
"Repress your emotions," said the stroller;
" and prepare to depart instantly from 'this
place.
Albert had observed that the beggar carried
under his arm a small bundle, which he' now
unrolled. It proved to be a long; singular
looking garment, but not wholly unknown to
the reader, who will recognize it as the same
worn by Weird Elsie.
" Put this on," said the stroller, "as quickly
as possible. It has done good service on several
occasions, and P pray heaven that it may on
this.  You observe that it has a hood like -
domino-pull it over your face. Now we are
ready."
The parties issued from  the cell, and after
going a few yards, the mendicant stopped and
unlocked another door ; it was the chamber of
justice where Louis Vidal had been conducted
to await tle pleasure of Mark Donhead. = The
youth was sitting in a disconsolate manner ujon
a heap of straw, where our hero had passed
some uncomfortable hours-hinislf.
.The lad started up in great astonishment, but
Willie laid his finger upon his lips, and signified
by a gesture that he should follow them ; which
was a thing so agreeable to his own feelings,
that he obeyed with wonderful alacrity. Ob.
serving the profoundest silence, and agitated by
numberless fears, the parties glided like mid-
night spectres towards'the Silver Bell.
So strong were the emotions of Lady Eveline,
that she was several times in danger of becom-
ing unconscious; but Albert supported hei and
whispered words of cheer. She trembled at the
echo of every sound ; the damp currents of air,
sweeping from different passages, sounded 'to
her like the wings of death, and' chilled her
blood until 'it seemed to be congealing within
her veins. The horror with' whieh the baditti
had inspired' her mind had nearly dethroned
the powers of reason and sell-consciousness ; but

CHAPTER XXI.
~ceNcLUsIoN. i

HE monk continued: " One day, I saw
KJthe captain conversing with a man whose
appearance struck me as resembling, in many
respects, the servant with whom the children of
Sit Williamhado last been seen. When I was
alone with Donhead, he told me that, the per-
son's name was Peter Vidal; and that he had
a daughter of uncommon beauty, - to whom be
(the captain) was about to be wedded.  This
information keited my curiosity, for I was still
hoping that some fortunate chance would di-
'vulge the secret of the disappearance of those
whom I had promised to protect, should they
evrneed a protector.  Full of these feelings,
Visited Vidal's cottage, and when I beheld
the sweet fate of yonder maiden, I could
seamcely doubt that I had found the daughter of
Sir William."
The monk, as he spoke, pointed to Isandra,
and immediately all eyes were turned in that
direction.
"The damsel certainly bears a striking re-
semblance in features, to Sir 'William Win-
borne l" exclaimed the Lord of Moteombe.
"This is indeed a strangely interesting nar-
rative."

The relation of the monk had been listened
to by Casside (as we prefer to call him) and
Isandra and Louis with absorbing interest ; and
when the last announcement we made concern-
ing the fair shepherdess, our hero could not re-
press an exclamation of joyful surprise.
"Before proceeding," added the monk, "I
will call the attention of this gentle company to
yonder lad, who, though not dressed in the
garments legitimately belonging to his sex, will
still, by his features, give additional weight to
the statements I have already made."
Poor Louis blushed like a bashful girl,..and
shrank from the earnest glances that were in-
stantly fastened upon him. Lord Moteombe
looked attentively at Louis, and affirmed that
" all those persons familiar with the features of
Lord Winborne would not be at a loss to -dis-
cover a strong resemblance upon the face of the
youth ;"- who doubtless at that moment vivid'
ly recalled the prediction of Weird Elsie con-
cerning the boots and spurs.
" Weird Elsie," resumed father David, with
a smile, addressing Louis, " promised you the
spurs of knighthood; and I will stake an hun-

dred iorins that the prophecy will prove no
falehood.  But to go on with my story: Upon
questioning Isandra in regard to her early life,
Found that she had but little knowledge of it;
for children of four years soon forget the tran-
sactions of so early a period of their existence.
She remembered, only, that many years ago
she had lived somewhere else ; but all the par-,
tieulars of the manner of living, etc., were
almost entirely obliterated; she retained no
knowledge of any other mother than the wife of
Peter Vidal, whom she had always considered
as such, until the time of her death, which event
occurred some four years ago; since which time
the care of Louis and the domestic affairs had
devolved solely upon her.. I exerted all my
powers to gain the confidence of Vidal, and sue-
eeede4 beyond my expectations. One night,
when deep in his cups, he confessed to me that
Isandra and Louis were not his children; and
that he received a yearly stipend for their
maintenance.I
"'They are'sprung,' said he, ' from a noble
house, whose ancestral glory has departed for-
ever. They are the children of Sir William
Winborne.'
":He died, possessed, I believe, of consid-
erable wealth," I remarked, carelessly.
"' He did,' replied Vidal, ' and the bulk of
it is now in possession of Stephen Landsmere,
a distant relative on my lord's side, who would'
have been the legal heir, providing the latter
had died childless.''%
"' These assertions,' he added, 'are not
mere:fabrications of my own; I have papers at
the cottage to prove all I say.' "
' Anddid you manage to procure those im-
portant documents ?" asked Lord Motcombe,
eagerly.
:" I did," replied the monk, " and here they
are; I confide them to the care of his highness,
that he may examine them when it shall be his
pleasure to do so.".
Father David (Lord 'Cranston) produced
from beneath his domino a bundle of papers,
and with a low bow, placed them in the lands of
thesdistinguished-looking youth, who had given

Casside the ring. At the word "highns'
Albert started in astonishment, as he had done
on the previous occasion when that term had;
been employed.
"Do not be surprised, my Lord-.Ethelbert,"
said the personage'referred- to, addressing himn
self to our hero. ".Ilam called Edward, and in
a few days, God willing, shall be crowned king
of England."
With glowing cheek and beating heart, Al-
bert hastened to throw himself at Prince Ed-
ward's feet--that distinguished personage who
was to be afterwards known as Edward III.,
and whose renown as a sovereign was destined
to spread far and wide.
" Arise, sir!" said the prince, graciously.
"I have not forgotten the important service
which you rendered me_ so recently. It shall
be mine to look into this affair which concerns
so intimately yonder blushing maiden and the
youth beside her, and to restore them to the
position which they should justly occupy. I
am glad that it will shortly be in my power tb
advance their fortunes and yours. The indi-
vidual'upon whom your eyes are now fastened,
is my uncle-.-the Earl of Kent."
Albert tendered his respects to the latter in a
manner becoming his rank, and according to
the custom of the times.
"By the way," added Prince Edward, mu-
singly, " as soon as our coronation has taken
place, we must mate out full and complete jus.
tice to Sir Hugh Sjencer and his reprobate son ;
the latter having seen fit,- in addition to his
other crimes, to join 'himself to this notorious
horde of ' banditti, and to ,cause to be carried
away a daughter of my Lord of Motcombe-one
of our most faithful friends and subjects. My
worthy Sir Charles," he continued, turning
kindly to the monk,."be good enough to pry
ceed with your tale."
"Shortly after making the important dias
covery already related," resumed Cranston,
"while I was devising means to restore Isandra
and Louis to thiir rights, and to bring Don-
head and- his fellows to speedy justice, in the
disguise of Strolling Willie, I first met th

OMng gentleman, who, at that-time, pleased to
cell himself Albert Casside. -Now it so hap-
1nedithat.I had 'heard, that very day, of the
unfortunate difficulty that had occurred in the
familyof Lord Moteombe, and also its cause.
B       .ing on intimate terms with'both Isandra and
Lus   the character of a ionk, I had learned
from.the latter that a young man of distinguish-
ed bearing, though clad in the manner in which
you now see Ethelbert, had often had stolen
interviews with his sister ; and he had every
reasonsto.believe that a strong friendship had
sprung up between them. This. information
interested me exceedingly, as may be supposed ;
inasmuch as it had a direct bearing.upon the
happiness of one whom I considered my protege.
"I requested Louis to describe the young
man as minutely as possible, and he did so.
The moment I saw Casside (for it must be- re-
collected that I was blind only when I chose to
be) at the Silver Bell, I recognized the subject
of the lad's description.  Schooled as I was in
the ways of the world, I needed no second
glance to tell me that he was not what his gar
noted. I was confirmed in this opinion when
I noticed more particularly the value and work
manship of the sword which hung at his side;
for it certainly was not in keeping with his rus
set coat. His moody and dejected-looks showed
me, at once, that he was laboring under some
heavy disappointment ;and this fact, added t
thev circustances already ,mentioned, gave mi
aiu instantaneous clue to his real name and char
aster.    .
"The conviction that next followed wa
equally natural ; for, if the young Lord o
Moteombe had loved imprudently, Isandra, o
aUl others, was most likely to be the object o
his affections; for, begging the damsel's pardon
she was exceedingly fair to lidok upon."
"eExcuse the interruption," said Lord Mot
combe, "but I would ask if you were known t
Joachim Capet, or any of the banditti, in tha
disguise'?"
"I was not," answered Cranston. "A
Strolling Willie and Weird Elsie, no one share
my secret, and I have the consciousness of fee

ing that I have accomplished some good' in,
these characters. Mark Donhead, struck with,
your fine athletic figure," continued the monk,
addressing our herb, " was anxious to enroll'
you among his men ; and with that object in'
view, planned the taking - of your purse, with
Joachim Capet, in order to compel you to some
decisive step. I frustrated the "scheme in a
manner already known to you; but on the fol-
lowing day you were robbed in the forest, with-
out my knowledge.    Having learned   more
perfectly the, designs of Mark in relation. to
Isicndra, upon mature reflection, I changed my
views somewhat, and resolved to advise you to
accept of his proposals ; in order that you might
be able to assist in baffling his intentions, so
that sufficient time might be gained for the men-
at-arms to arrive which his highness had already
*sent for."
- I am curious to know in what manner you
t learned the fact that any of the king's men had
been sent for'?" said the Earl of Kent.
I   " You shall be gratified ; Joachim  Capet
listened at your chamber door, and heard you
speaking to that effect."
" Ab, the scoundrel!" added the earl, with'
; a smile.
- " I am anxious to hear about this fair of
d Sir Hugh Spencer and the Lady Eveline;"
said the prince.
o    " Godfrey Ridenger, or more properly, Sir
e Hugh Spencer, planned and execite.d that vil-
- lanous enterprise without my knowledge; -ad
even Mark Donhead had little to say, or do, in
s the matter. 'Had I but had any intimation of
f what was intended, the transaction would never,

f Lady Eveline had been spared a most unpleasant'
, experience.. And now I believe I have :ex-

at " You have not alluded to the robbery of my

Zn due time our hero and heroine were united ;
amd the occasion was celebrated in a manner
bdedming their rank ; the young king himself
honoring the bridal with his presence.  Lady
Eveline eventually became the wife of a distin-

guished nobleman.
The Silver Bell passed into honest-hands;
and the heir of Moteombe Manor and his lovely
bride never mention it without peculiar emotions;
it having been the scene of so many strange

events bearing directly upo their present and
future happiness.
Lord Cranston, at the earnest solicitation of
all parties -concerned, took up his residence at
Motcombe Manor, where lie was greatly es-
teemed, especially by Isandra and Louis, who
entertained for him much of the affection which
they would have felt for a father. The predic-
tion of Weird Elsie proved sooth in all respects,
and some years after Louis received'the ac-
colade from the hand of his sovereign.
Peter Vidal was banished th4e kingdom on
pain of death ; consequently was never seen in
those parts again.
Thus, gentle reader; have all parties been. j
rewarded and punished according to their good-
ness or " badness ; and the great 'moral lessor'
inculcated, that honesty, in all the transactions
of life, is the wisest and best policy ; a truth
which will-no doubt be remembered by all those
who may read the tale of Tas SiLva BELL.
