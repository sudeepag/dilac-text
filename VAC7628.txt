CHAPTER.I.
THE FUGITIVE.-           -
The clattering of horses' feet, the ringing
notes of a trumpet, and the shouts of dra-
goons, suddenly disturbed the solitudes of tie,
Santee. A man with bare head and stream-
ing hair was seen to leap a wall and run
rapidly across a glade. Toiling up a rugged
ascent, he paused on the summit and looked
back upon his pursuers ; for the horsemen
were evidently such.  A glance sufficed, to
show that they were rapidly gaining ground.
A feeling of utter hopelessness for a moment
chained him to the spot. Large drops of
perspiration rained from his forehead; the
blood whirled wildly in his veins ; his chest
rose and fell violently ; and he panted like a
dog overheated in the chase.
The thunder of the dragoons rolled nearer
and nearer ; the sound struck ominously upon
his ears.
"Colonel Somerton and his dragoons !" he
muttered, drawing the palm of his hand across
his hot brow. "Brave as a lion and impetu-
ous as a whirlwind ! he, mu-t be fest of foot
who baffles him. I have dared his vigilance
once too often. How madly he rides-leap-
ing walls, fences, ditches, rocks, and fallen
trees! He is down-no, he is up ! It was but
a depression of the ground that hid him from
view. They see me ! I mu-t on !"
He ceased, pressed his hand to his beating
heart, and added, bitterly :
"I must on; but where? The hounded fox
may find a cover, and the hunted stag may
turn upon the pack ; but I can do neither."
The fugitive darted down the hill, an4pres-
ently reached the bank of the Santee, the
waters of which at that spot were deep and
rapid. He hesitated ; it required a strong
and bold swimmer to dare such a 'current.

The voice of Colonel Somerton came echoing
down the hill :
"Forward, men ! forwardI The villain is
ours!"
That shout quickened him to another effort.
lHe bounded froi, the bank, was submerged an
instant; but. rising, struck outfor the opposite
shore. The stream bore him downward with
irresistible force. le battled with the waters,
parting them with his strong, nervous arms.
Somerton'spurred his horse, and attempted
to follow ; but the animal soon lost his footing,
and was swept from his eourse. His dragoons,
less heated by the chase, or more prudent, re-
mained on the bank, watching anxiously the
progress of their leader, and the manly exer-
tions of the swimmer, who, notwithstanding
the difficulties with which he was obliged to
contend, finally effected a landing, far below
the point from which he bad started. For a
short space he lay exhausted upon the earth ;
then, staggering to his feet, shook the water
from his saturated garments. By this time,
Somerton was in the middle of the stream;
there was no time to be lost. He ran up the
bapk. Before him was an open field, with a
wood beyond. Hope animated his breast, im-
parting strength to his over-tasked limbs. If
he could cross the field and enter the wood,
he could defy pursuit. Stimulated by this
thought, he leaped a high fence. and was mak-
ing good progress, when, to his dismay, he
again henrd Somerton thundering after him.
.The wood was too distant to be attained. At
the right of the field there was a tract of
broken, ledgy ground, which be believed would
embarrass the movements of his pursuers,
and toward which he now turned, like the
wounded stag, which at every step loses a
portion of its strength with its flowing blood.
By efforts that seemed superhuman, he reach-

goodness prompted this visit. Who but thee
would have sought a wretch destined to die on
the morrow? Thou hast sweetened my cup o
bitterness, till the direful potion of death has

"How.dreadful is your position!" replied
Miss Redmond, with mournful vehemence.
Alas, Guy, for your memory when all is o- er !
Had you forfeited life in the cause of freedom,
this parting would have been less painful ;
but .to ge out of the world covered. with the

Have you not some powerful friend in the
Continental Army-or is there not some means
by which you can scale these wooden walls-
elude the sentinels-and leave the gallows be-

way-hit upon some happy invention-or, de-

'CHAPTER III.
HIRL, THE HUNoClnAot.
The soft and mellow haze of twilight was
descending upon the:camp, when the clear
challenge of an American sentinel rang out
upon 'the air:
- ".Who goes there ?"
" A friend."
"Stop, friend, and give the counersign."
The person thus challenged was seated in a
cart, which was drawn by a sorry-looking horse
-the thinness of which seemed to attest to a
long penance of fasting. The driver of this
animal was far-from prepossessing in appears
ance. He was of large, frame, but his figure
was rendered disagreeable by a painful stoop
and a monstrous protuberance between hit
shoulders. We cannot describe him better
than by simply affirming that he was a hunch-
back. His face, which otherwise would not
have been ugly, was made repulsive by a
wound upon the right cheek, imperfectly con-
cealed by a patch. He had apparently pass-
ed the prime of. life, for long gray hairs flu-
tered over his forehead. He wore a sut os
homespun, brown, better adapted 'for hard
service than show. His patriarchal head was
protected by a round cloth cap, which bore
unmistakable impress of long use.
A large powder-horn and ball-pouch hung
under his left arm; while 'beside him in the
cart, braced against the rude seat, was one of
those redoubtable weapons denominated the
king's-arm.'
Instead of stopping his horse when chal-
lenged, he jogged on, jerking the reins, and
muttering
" Go 'long, Crazy ! go 'long! A'n't afeard
o' nothin' you see hereabouts, be ye ?"
"Halt I". shouted the sentinel, raising his
musket.
" Git out the w y,' you ragged critter.
Don't you know b tter than to be standin'
right :in the way of a hoss and cart ?" cried
the hunchback, petulantly.
" Stop, or I fire !" said the sentinel, warn-
ingly.
'" Whoa, Crazy, whoa!" said the old man,
stopping his bony beast with much tugging
and sawing upon the bit. " Don't pint that
-gun. at me, you reckless divil! Why in the
name o' conscience don't you fight the inemy
instead o' your friends? Nobody'll coma
anighst ye bimeby, if you go on in this ry.
dicerlous way. What in time you want ?"
"' The'countersign, you old' fool-the coun.
tersign !" roared the sentinel.
" Hey?  What? Speak louder, if you

or up'ards."
The hunchback cocked his head upon one
side with that earnest vacuity of expression
indicative of the unhappy infirmity which he
had avowed.
" You heerd well enough jest now !" snarl-
ed the soldier. -
" What perduced it, did ye say ? God, I
s'pose, or it might been natural, leastwise.
The old woman says 'twas done by one the
Smith gals a singin' treble in my ears when I
led the singin' ; but that don't look reasona-
ble to me. Washington in the camp ?"
Tie hunchback looked at the sentinel with
an air of such perfect simpli ity, that he could
not refrain from laughing.
I reckon you know a precious sight about
military affairs, oil mn. Do you s'pose the
great Washington goes canterin' about the
country like an itinerantparson or a common
whipster."
They say he's a mighty good fighter, and
makes- the redcoats run like a flock o' sheep."
,Enough of this, old gentleman ! Give me
the countersign, or move off."
" My name's IIirl-old Hirl, ill-mannered
folks call me."
"Confound him!" muttered the soldier.
"What do I do ? Used to be a blacksmith ;
am a swordmnaker, now. Made quite a lot o'
weapons for Marion's men. Cut up old mill-
saws and si :h. Let me in, will ye? Can't
stan' here fooling' much longer."
"I've a mind to fire on the old chatter-
box !" said the sentinel, beginning to be an-
gry again.
"'Yes, I'm right handy with tools ; can put
-          an edge on your sabres that'll cut a hair.
Sog3r-feller, that bagonet o' your'n is blunt
as your thumb. How can you stick sich a
thing as that into a Britisher? Might as well
carry a b 'an-pole."
Losing all patience, the sentinel strode up
to the hunchback, anI1 seizing him by the col-
lar, howled in his ear :
"The password! the password !"
" Why the divil didn't you say so in the
fast place ?" screamed the old man, fretfully.
"Come down to bring a few sabres to Wash-
ington to, hash up the redcoats with. Guest
he'd swear some, if he knowed how you'd kept
me outside with your imperdence."
" I asked you for the countersign ten min-
utes ago.'"
"I hain't got it ;" and if I had, I wouldn't
deliver it to nobody but the gineral. I ain't
a man as seeks arter signs of no kind." '
At that juncture, Captain Rainford, who
had heard a part of this dialogue, stepped for-
ward and demanded of the proprietor of the
horse and cart what he wanted.
" I want to see the officer in command," an-

swered the hunchback, peevishly. " Been

I'm sorry to say, mister, that the regerlations

into the cart, and hurried right down with a
few o' my best razors, that'll shave a Britisher
'thout lather or hot water. Come and look at
'em, sir. Or, perhaps," added the hunchback,
reflectively, "you'd better take me right to
the gineral."
Then to the sentinel:
" Watch that cart, there, for you don't seem
to have nothin' else to do ; though if I's boss
here, I'd keep ye a shoulderin', and orderin',
and presenting' till you could scurcely st-m' on
your legs. I shall speak to Washington about
the gineral looseness hereabouts, in p'int o'
disciplyne."
" You've brought us some blades of home
manufacture, have you, my good man ?" said
Rainford, smiling.
"He's brought the High Hills of the Santee
on his back, I should think !" muttered the
sentinel.
"Yes, major, I'ye brought ye some good
'uns that I'll warrant to do the business, if
properly used."  Then to the soldier: " You
feller with the musket, you can have the pass-
'word now, if you want it; though little good
it'll do ye, for I's bound to see your com
mander, anyhow. Marion ! there, you hay
it ! I hope this'll teach ye to mind your own
consarns, and treat the friends o' Cgngress
with respect. Come 'up, Crazy, come up !
Guess, on the whole, we'll take the cart right
along, for somebody might steal' the razors,
you know; and I should be pesky loth to have
'em swingin' on the wrong side, hashin' up
our folks 'stead o' the Britishers."
" You are very welcome, my man. Bring
your horse and cart inside the lines. Whiat's.
your name ?" said the captain, eyeing his
strange visitor with considerable curiosity.
" My name is Hirl; though ill-mannered
people call me Old Hirl, Crazy Hirl, Deef
Hirl, and so on. You can take your choice,

now I'm a swordmaker, and can sharpen up

" Nothing of importance, excepting the cap-
ture of a tory spy," replied Rainford, care-
lessly.
" Come'long, Crazy ! The old gal's gittin'
tired. A spy, eh ?  Well that's good news !
You'll string him up right up, I s'pose ?" said
the hunchback, with a business air.
''He will be executed to-morrow morning."
"This is a nice creetur o' mine, major. You

A bitter smile swept over the prisoner's

"might have permitted me a few hours for
repose, uninterrupted by those dire notes of

ism."
"Repose, indeed ! Innocence itself could
not sleep in a situation so awful !"
Somerton spoke with the solemnity he
really felt ; while the prisoner's handsome
face lighted with some inexplicable emotion.
The wonder and bewilderment of the colonel
increased, communicating corresponding feel-
ings to the practical Rainford.
" We gain nothing," said the latter ; " and
the interview is becoming uncomfortable."
"Good night, gentlemen! We shall meet
again in the morning," said the prisoner, with
his peculiar look and smile.
" Whoever 'you are, I am sorry for you,"
answered Somerton, slowly following Rain-
ford from the cabin.
Sergeant Giles was standing near the door.
"Sergeant," the colonel began, " you saw

He suddenly checked himself, adding, in a
lower voice :
" Pshaw ! what nonsense ! There can be
no mistake. 'Tis the last trick of a gamester
who plays for life. Drowning nen catch at

As the officer walked away, he was followed
by the dissonance of the saw, and the 'dull
sound of the -hammer. He turned and be-
held, with an involuntary shiver, men raising
two posts with a transverse beam. He hur-
ried to his quarters ; but could stillsee, in
imagination, the skeleton frame looming grim
in the moonlight.     -   '

CHAPTER V.
THE   EX ECU T,1 ON.
Day dawned, and the Continental camp
shook off its slumbers. There was a stir
among officers and- men. Somert6n looked
wearily from his tent. ' He had passed a
troubled night. When, after tossing a long
time, he finally fell'asleep, his repose-was dis-
turbed by the same train of thought that had
kept him wakeful. He dreained of -is pris-
oner, the young wornan who had visted' him,
and Old Hirl, the hunchback.
The colonel arose, :depressed by' a heavy
consciousness of the disagreeable' duty which
the day would bring. Leaving his quarters,
-,e took a solitary walk around the outposts

of the little camp, still pursued by thoughts,
of Guy Deering, and the contradictory char-
acter of his last interiew with that misguided
person. As he slowly returned, he was mt
by Rainford.
I" I wait your orders, colonel,"lie said brief-
ly.
"There is no need of haste. Let him have
as much time as possible," Somerton replied.
" That was not thought of by our enemies
when Hale as minded the cart," returned
Rainford.
" To their shame be it spoken !" exclaimed
omerton. Then, after a pause : "Have you
s en him this morning?"
" I just looked in to see if he was there,'
"How did he appear? Wa3 he less coi
tradictpry than ]ist night ?"
" The same! 'the same! There was no
change in his deportment."
"1 I regret'it ! I hoped that solitude and
reflection would bring him-to reason."
"On the contrary, he was firmer-in his in
credible assertions than before. I really be-
lieve he thinks to escape, even at this late
hour. Truly, his composure is incompre-
hensible."
" Possibly," said Somerton, " it may arise
from a mistaken notion of duty."
" That is quite probable ; for the greatest
criminals have sometimes been the wildest
fanatics, dying-as they imagine-martyrs to
right."
--Go and ask him," enntinued the colonel,
thoughtfully, "if he wishes thio consolations
of religion."
"'The very question I proposed. He laid
his hand upon his breast, and replied that
he already experienced such consolation with-
in him."
"It is passing strange!  Send Sergeant
Giles to inform him thdt he 'has but dn hour
to live."
The sergeant being near, was immediately
dispatched on this errand, which he fulfilled
with all that military alacrity on which he
'prided himself.
"Well?"'said Somerton, interrogatively,
glancing at his messenger.
" He said," replied Giles, "that it was more
time than he expected ; and he hoped it would
be more than sufficient to prove his inno-
cence."
Captain Rainford, never celebrated for his
gentleness, on hearing this, made use of sun-
dry expletives bordering on profanity. Even
the-patient Somnerton seemed annoyed by this
reply.
" Did-he express any desire to see a clergy-
man ?" that officer demanded.
" When I ventured to hint, your honor,
that he ought to have a parson to tinker up
his conscience, he shook his head with a sol-

emn sort o' smile, and said : ' If I've neglect-
ed my soul till now, it's sartinly ,too late to
save it ; but if I've attended to it, it will not
be desarted at the hour o' death.' Them was
his words, and every one of 'em seemed to
weigh the matter of a pound."
'I have done my duty !" exclaimed Somer-
ton. " Captain Rainford, muster the dra-
goons. An hour is the utmost grace that can
be given. If Tarleton should get wind of
what is going on, it wouldn't be strange if he
should attempt to rescue. He and Cornwal-
lis have been closeted more than, once with
Guy Deering, no doubt."
Soon the blast of a bugle was heard,, follow-
ed by the clanking of sabres, the rattling of
spurs, the neighing of horses, and the heavy
tramp of dragoons. A part of the brigade
was drawn up in the form of a hollow square
around the gallows that had been erected the
previous night. Inside this phalanx, A cor-
re ponding number of more lightly aimed
troopers were paraded on foot. All being
ready for the terrible drama, a deep and ex-
pectant silence ensued.
Presently, Sergeant Giles entered the cabin
with a file of men, and brought 'out the pris-
oner, upon whom every eye was instantly
turned. His face was somewhat flushed when
he first appeared, but it soon became pale
and calm. He advanced firmly and stood in
the fatal square, when he paused, and looked
slowly around. His glance rested upon Som-
erton.
" Tell Colonel Somerton," he said, " that
I would speak with him a moment."
His desire was at once made known to the
commanding officer, who reluctantly ap-
proached.
" Mr. Deering," he said, Â°".I have been in-
formed that you have something to say to
me."
" Much! much!" answered the prisoner,
with emphasis.
" Say on, then, for the time is brief," said
the officer.
"'Brief, indeed!" said the spy, quickly. "It
would seem that there is but a short quarter
of an hour before me.   Although yonder
orb" (he pointed to the sun) " will rise and
set millions of times, I shall not see it set or
rise again. How should you feel, colonel, in
my situation ?"
"If," returned Somerton, earnestly, " I
were dying in my country's cause, with no
stain o' my name, I should feel that the smile
of God was on me."
- "I comprehend," said the prisoner, color-
ing.
"Mr. Deering-" the colonel began.
" I have told you that my name is Hender-
son," interrupted the spy, in a decisive voice.
" Henderson or Deering-for it makes little

19

difference what I call you-if you have aught
to communicate, come to the point and be
brief. I am disposed to be humane ; but with
me duty is imperative."
Before answering, the prisoner partially
turned, and looked anxiously toward the San-
tee, the murmur of whose waters could be
heard. Somerton noticed the action, and said,
warningly :
" Young man, I solemnly believe that you
are beyond human aid. If Tarleton and his
legion were to appear this moment, you could
not be rescued alive. A volley from my men
would end all before the foremost of our ene-
mies could come to the charge."
"I do not expect Tarleton," responded the
prisoner, with a smile that seemed a niockery
of death.
"Do I understand that you have spoken
what you wish to say ?" demanded the Conti-
nental officer, authoritatively.
" No, no !" exclaimed the spy, with a vehe-
mence that w'as in striking contrast to his for-
mer quietness.
"' In Heaven's name speak, then, for the
time draws n ar!"
" God forbid !  Never, never !" he cried,
with more feeling than he had yet exhibited.
" Your terrible situation has disordered
your mind," replied Somerton, in a troubled
voice.
"It may *o appear to you ; but possibly
the time may come-"
He stopped, and looked, once more to the
south.
- " Some false and deceptive hope still sup-
ports you. Reject it- abandon it-fling it
from you as the enemy of your future peace.
Employ the few remaining moments in
prayer. Yonder is the chaplain of the brig-
ade ; he looks anxiously this way. Permit
me to summon him. He waits but for a sig-
nal, and I will give it."
The colonel waved his hand, and the indi-
vidual referred to quickly approached. In
person and outward appearance, he bore small
resemblance to one's idea of a man of God.
He was a large, wiry-looking personage, with
brawny hands, thick neck, and swarthy fea-
tures, which, instead of that softness and meek-
ness generally supposed to characterize his
profession, were hard and severe in their ex-
pression. Instead of prayer-book or missal,
he carried a ponderous sword, and wore be-
neath a leather belt a brace of pistols.
The risoner regarded him with a faint
smile an was about to refuse his services,
when so e new thought changed hi, purpose.
" Hum brey," said Somerton, " but a few
moments a e left to this wretched man. Do

in a stra' like this."
"I an do nothing of myself," answered the

stroke across the shoulders ; and then' pro-
duced a large snuff-box, took a pinch herself,
and then significantly held the box toward
the offending Meg, who made a wry face,
shrugged her shoulders, and reluctantly took
a few grains of the obnoxious powder betweenn
her thumb and finger.
"Nose!I" said Miss Betsey, imperiously.
Meg's hand made a slow journey toward
the orgai so laconically mentioned by her
mistress.'
"She hates it," said the latter, explanator-
ily, to the colonel. "It's a way that I have
of correctin' her faults, which .are legion ; and
the most abominable of which is her entire
ignorance of the motions of the wheels o'
time."      -
"Karshew I" sneezed Meg, which action
was followed by a grin irresistibly ludicrous.
Somerton smiled-the, dragoons laughed.
"Time," observed the colonel,, gravely,
perceiving the hobby of Dame Grindle, "is
truly not a thing to' be trifled with ; for, be
it ever so ill-spent, we cannot recall it to live
it over.",                          '
The swordmaker, meantime, had drawn'
near Betsey Grindle ; and was continuing,
from a closer point of observation, the scru-
tiny which he had begun at a distance.
"Squire Redmond's sister a'n't ye, mum ?"
he said, carelessly  "Have seen ye at' the
plantation, though my face mayn't'be familiar
to ye."
Dame Grindle turned suddenly upon the
interrogator, whose simple words had evi-
dently excited so  interest in her mind.
"Don't rememb   seem' ye durin' the whole
course e' my life. Have so much to do that
I get precious -little opportunity to notice
folks that come to our place."
"Folks well? How's the young .women?
Used' to know Judith. Nice gal! nice gal! !
Knew whQ used to hitch his horse to her
father's door, but I won't call no names.
He's  took to evil courses, they say, since.
British gold oughter be like p'ison to an hon-
est man."
Dame Grindle's ghastly face became, for a
moment, red, and her large eyes seemed to
emit sparks of fire.
"You're not his judge, old man; and, let
me tell you, you're speakin' lightly of one-"
Betsey Grindle'stopped,
" Y,es, you say truly' he was an undutiful
son, although I can say, without p'evarication,
that he loved the gal. 'Twasn't  common
love, neither ; but that-kind that' never goes
out, either by fasting or prayer, but lasts o
the eend. The poor soul used to exclaim: 'If
she on'y knowed me as I.,am! If she eod
on'y read my motives ! But she can't-she
won't !' Ah, Goody Grindle, you'4 ough er
heerd him!"                       -   e

By this time the spinster was pale again.
A mist and dimness floated before her eyes.
She gazed at the swordmaker with wonder-
ful earnestness.
"I forbid you to speak his name !" she
said, with emotion.
"My name is Hirl, though ill-mannered
people call me Old Hirl, Deef Hirl, Crazy
Hirl, and sich," piped the hunchback."
"Colonel Somerton," said Dame Grindle,
turning sharply upon that officer, "take
these things away, if you want 'em, and make
judicious distribution of 'em among your dra-
goons. Meg ! stop grinnin', and think of the
wheels o' time that are every minute rollin'
ye to your grave."
" Karshew !" responded Meg.
"In behalf ofmy dragoons, I thank you,
Miss Grindle. God knows the poor fellows
need help !" said Somerton, with warmth.
"Oh, sir, that's all understood! Don't waste
the minutes, for they're 'muazin' short, and go
quicker this year nor they did last. There !
my business with you is done. Good day,
colonel ! Don't say anything more to me,
'cause words don't cost nothin', and stockin's
do. Next time you meet the Britishers, give
'em an extra cut or two for me. That's all I
ask."
The spinster at that moment appeared to
become conscious that many eyes were fas-
tened upon her.
- "Go off, you rude clowns ! Didn't you
never see a woman afore? Ruther run the
g'antlet than be stared -at this way.. Pack
off, the whole of ye, or not another sock will
ye git o' me, if I live to be as old as Methu-
salum. Oughter be fightin', too, when time
is so precious. There's tories and Britishers
enough to keep ye busy'every blessed min-
ute."
Somerton made a gesture to such of the
'dragoons as the scene had drawn together;
and they retired, jnuch amused. - He then
ordered Corporal Thornton to carry the pack-
age to his quarters.
"If you wish refreshments, or if I can do
you any courtesy," the colonel begat
"Don't talk to. me of 'refreshment and
courtesy,' when there's sch doin's through-
out the length and breadth of the land ! Do
you s'pose I can stop to eat and drink, and
hear fine speeches, when there's so much
knittin' to do, and your men eenamost out to
the weather for coats and breeches, and the
Lord on'y-knows who's, going' to make 'em, or
where there -to come from? Mornin', sir,

"Goodomorning," responded the colonel,
and walked away..

"Whatever you say to me, Guy Deering
'shalleear,"-answered the hunchback, with pe-
culiar emphasis.
' Old man, look at me!. Keep faith with
me as you hope to have it kept with you in
the most serious things that concern your life
and happiness. Take this 'saw and this 'purse:
pass the first through a creyice to Deering:
put the last in your pocket for the benefit of
your wife and children. You have said that
you shall work late to-night; udo so in Heav-
en's name ! The noise of your hammer will
drown the noise of the saw. It is but a small
favor for you to grant, but -mueh and momen-
totus iii its consequences to him."
While the womanwas thus eloquently speak-
ing in behalf of the spy, she drew a small saw
and a purse from beneath her gown, and prof-
fered them to the hunchback. He received
the saw, but not the purse. Tears stood in
his eyes.s
" Woman ! woman! take away your gold
I can sarve a feller-creetur without bein' brib-
ed to do it. I can~ and I will."
"And you will give him the saw ?"
"Be as sure that it shall reach the hands of
Guy Deering as that you see it in mine."
"Good, kind, generous soul! God forever
bless you Ah! how can we be conquered
when even poor men like you spurn gold.?"
"Spurn gold !" repeated the old man, with
a s irdonie laugh. "Some say"-he turned
from her to hide his emotion.i "Should I see
the hunted youth," he added, anon, in a shak-
ing voice, "might I ta~ke the liberty to tell
him that your niece thinks a deal of im, and
don't believe more'n half that is said consarn-
in' himV Might I tell him? It would so
cheer him-solighten, as 'twere, his'breakin'
heart."
The swordmaker had by this time turned
quite around again, and stood face to face with
her, with clasped hands.s.
"You ~  ay 1' you may! .ssiire him that

"Hush! 'Sergeanut Giles a mcs the way !"
int posed Hirl, in a wiispe . "'Twas very

piping tones, "tobring 'em  o camp, for hal
o' th brave lads haven't a stoakiai' to thei

drew near. "One with a contain on hi

"Good-bye to ye, Mr. Swordmnaker. Your

can do a good 'eal yet, if you' improve the
time. I'm in a terrible hurry, for there's a
power o' work to do when I git home.
"Birds of a feather flock together," quoth
Giles. "They appear to be very well mean-
in' people, but they'd worry me into a con-'
sumption if I saw 'em often.'
"Meg, horses ! Horses, Meg !" said Dame
Grindle.
"Nice 'mulatto gal ! Eyes like glass beads,
and teeth like pearls. What an old witch for
a mistress !" added Giles.
"Meg; hand !"
Meg held her hand for her mistress to mount
from, and received a suggestive stroke from her
switch as reward. She then Ieaped nimbly to
her own horse ; and after casting a coquettish
glance at the sergeant, ambled away after
Dame Grindle.
CHAPTER VII.
THE SWOnDMAKER AT HIS TASK.
The hammer of the swordmaker was heard
till the small hours of the night. Various
kinds of weapons passed 'through his indus-
trious fingers. Battered swords, blunted and
bent bayonets, ,and even damaged pistol and
gun-locks, were sent to his tentfor repairs.
ISeveral good-natured fellows offered to assist

ly rejected.
l "Every one to his trade," said the old man.
1  I might as well mount one of your heavy
dragoon horses and go sogerin', as for people
that never struck hot iron in their lives to
'think o' bein' any sarvice to me. If temper-
in' a sword, or restorin' a good edge to a blunt-
ed weapon is so mighty easy, there wouldn't
be.no need o' y trampin" from one part the
country to another. ' Jest keep out o' my way ;
t that's all I'll ask. Out o' my tent, every one
yon ye!"
So the hunchback thumped, and blowed,
" nd filed, and polished all alone. The 'senti-
y nels that guarded the prisoner looked in 'oc-,
i casionally, and when the swordmaker got tired,
f took a friendly drink 'with, him from a large
rt flask, which, whatever fluid It'contained,was
, clearly much to their liking'; for their calls
d became more frequent as the night progressed.

tied him at first; b1* quickly recollecting that
several fires were still burning, he believed,
that was a sufficient explanation of the fact.
He did not, howeverie dwagain; but, seat-'
ing himself upon a camp-stool, began to re-

these calculations, which possibly might have'

stupibled over a figure ; it was one of the men
who had charge of the prisoner, and who
roused himself, muttering a drunken objurh
action on whoever had disturbed his repose.
Somerton hastened. to the other side of the
cabin, and found the other sentinel seated up
on the ground, supported by a friendly post,
with a' strong odor of rum about his person.
The tent of the sword'maker remained where
he had reared it, but the sound of his 'ham-
mer had ceased. _Impelled by strong curios-

in the face, and drove him back. He paused
till the first gush' had passed, and the pent
gases had found 'momentary vent, and was
rushing in again, when the swordmaker-who
had followed him-caught him by the arm.
"Are you mad, colonel ?" he cried. "No
human creetur can live in there a minute."
"Let me go, old man ! The prisoner must
be saved at any risk, however great. It must
never be said that the Americans burn their
prisoners."
Somerton shook'off the grasp of the sword-
maker, and plunged into the whirling vortex
of smoke.
"Deering ! Deering 1" he called, and groped
from corner to corner.
He received no answer, and felt vainly for
the form of the spy. The carbonic vapors
went to his brain and lungs, and struck him
down in a moment.' A horrible gasping, chok-
ing, dying sensation overpowered him. He
seemed to be whirled to and fro like a feather
on the ocean. He felt himself death-doomed
. ands lost. ,There' was a footstep beside him ;
a strong hand lifted hini from the floor. It
was  Hirl, who had plunged after him into the
Tartarean bath of smoke and fire.
'omerton was conscious of, being dragged
a few paces ; that his deiverei appeared to
strike a passage through the wall with his
foot; that fresh' air rushed in ; that he was
, drawn through a narrow aperture, and placed
on the ground outside the blazing cabin. All
t this happened in less time than we have been
't relating 'it; and the colonel, after breathing
" the pure air a few seconds, was fully aware of
d the peril he had escaped, and to whom he
if owed his preservation. But Deering was still
- uppermost in his mind.
" Must he perish? ,Is there no way of reach-
. ing him?"' he cried, as soon as he was able to
a-speak.
The swordmaker was about to reply, when
r1 there was a deafening blare of trumpets, and
is the ground shook beneath the tread of horses.
"A charge'of Cavalry 1-a charge of eaval*
s, ry ! The enemy !-the enemy!" shouted Hirl,
in a stentorian voice.
n    "To horse.!-to horse !" thundered Somer-
ton, recovering his energies and self-posses-
d sion His 'voice was heard above the din of
a. trumpets  and 'the tramp of steeds. Almost
simultaneously was heard the firing of the
ld outposts, In a moment, the camp was astir.
ye There was a hurried seizing of arms, and a
g. headlong rushing'for horses. ~Somerton was.

of pain, and thought of his dragoons with in-
expressible longing.
"Go, 'long ! go 'long, Crazy !" said a voice,
that was familiar to the Continental officer,
who heard, also, the rumbling of a cart.
" Dontt 'magine you're goin' to a funeral, do
ye? Trhe rheumatics and neuralagy don't
trouble ye, do they,'old galf? Hirrup, I say!
birrup .'
" Tl  swordmaker !" murmured Somerton.
" What does he here? He is a false knave,
I'll swear!"
Meantime, Old Hirl trundled along to the
spot where the colonel was lying, and seeing
him, stopped his horse. Somerton lay quite
Motionless.
"One of the rebel creeturs," said Hirl.
"Cap'n Hadley's boys have made an eend of
him, I reckon. Well, all the rebels must
come to it,, sooner or later. The king's lads
are cuttin' 'em 'up like Satan ! Git up,
Crazy'!"
The swordmaker jerked at the reins, and
the cart rattled on again.
"Old Hirl! Deef Hirl !" cried several
voices ; and these exclamations, and others of
like character, passed from mouth to mouth.
"What you brought us now, old man"
demanded Captain Hadley, turning his sinis-
ter eyes upon the swordmaker.
"Bought a cow? No; there's none to
sell, as 1 knows on ! 'Tain't in my line," le
answered, with a slightly-injured expression.
Some of the tories laughed.
"Makin' fun of me, be ye? A  good 'eal o'
work 'shall I do for ye, if ye go on this way
Not a. puff will I blow for ye, nor a blow will
I strike !" added Hirl, petulantly.
"They don't mean any hurt," said Hadley,
soothingly. "What's the nEws from the rebel
camp ?"
Somerton heard this interrogatory, and lis-
tened with deep interest for the swordmaker's
reply
"'es, he was a great scamp," re lied the
hunchback, pointing to Somerton ;  ut he
'pears pooty well out the reach o' misc  f,
now."
"The old villain !" thought Somerton.
"I asked about the dragoons up t
river !" shouted Hadlev.
"Oh!I They're mightily cut up," replied
the old man,:rubbing his hands with satisfac-
tion. "There's scarcely one on 'em but got
an ugly cut from your fire-eaters, last night.
You made monstrous havoc among 'em, I tell
ye. There isn't twenty of 'em that can mount
a hoe., to-day, 'thout groanin'  You oughter
make another dash at 'em while they're stiff
from their wounds."
"I trusted that man !" murmured Somer-
ton. "In these troublous times on whom can
we rely ?"

"How do they bear the loss of their lead-
er ?" screamed Hadley.
"It works 'em .up 'mazin'! Cap'n Rain-
ford chafes to and fro like awild beast, swear-
in' that he'll have him, -dead or alive."a
"If he gets him, it will be as yosee him,
yonder," returned the tory with a shrug.
" Noticed him as I driv along. The breath
has gone clean out of him, and he lays there
stiff and ghastly. 'Tisn't a pleasant sight
about camp ; and it don't bring good luck to
have dead men so near, starin' at ye with
their glassy eyes." Â°
The tory leader glanced toward Somerton,
and then turned his face in another direction.
"I hate to have a body lookin' at me, as
'twere, when I work at nights in my little
tent," added the old man, with many dubious
shakes of the head. Then, with his eyes fix-
ed on the prostrate form of Somerton, he
went on: "How have the mighty fallen, and
the weepons o' war perished ! Yesterday
mornin', this rebel was in full strength, and
a terror to the royal troops; now he is cut
down as grass, and the cunnin' has departed
from his arm. I knowd his mother afore the
lad was born. For her sake, I'll jest give
him a decent burial; that is, dig a hole at
the roots of a tree, and kiver him with mo-
ther airth."
"Are you sure he's dead ?" asked Hadley.
"If you's dead as he is, cap'n, you'd thank
sombody to bury ye !" replied the sword-
maker impressively. ," If he's alive, I should
be the last one to get within reach of his
arm ; for he'd strangle me if he was ,,at his
last gasp! Seein' me here wouldn't make
him over friendly. I'll fling him into my
cart, and take him out o' the way ; for the
very sight of his body makes me shiver.
They say he was proper handy with the tools
--his aim was sure, and his blade sharp."
"Well, off with him, and make his bed
somewhere where it won't be seen too much,"
replied Hadley, carelessly, glad to be rid of
a dead enemy so easily.
Imagine the emotions of Somerton upon
hearing this conversation! Horror and in-
dignation struggled in his breast.
The hunchback turned his cart, muttering
s he did so : "If there's a few sparks o' life
in him, the clods '11 put 'em out. Yes, the
clods '11 put 'em out ; they'll put us all out
one o' these days."
Hirl turned his cart and approached the
colonel, mumbling to himself with the imbe-
cility of age.
"Rebels don't live long. It's a wicked
thing to turn against one's nat'ral king."
The wheels of the swordmaker's cart brush-
ed Somerton's garments, who had resolved to
feign death and trust his chance for escape
from the talons of this impromptu grave-C  -

darkness and uncertainty. Her terrors, which
had be   steadily increasing, could no longer
be concealed from Meg, upoa whom they acted
like a battery, each shock of which thrilled
her utterly.
"Oh, missus, I knowed somethin' drefful

too evi lent to need an interpreter. Instead
of inspiring confidence by her presence, her
company -was likely to prove anything but
-rc-assuring.'
"If you don't choose to follow me, you
can remain behind," replied Miss Grindle, in
as firm a voice as shecould command. She
touhe a her horse and moved on, but with a
dread and misgiving that fell little short of
Meg's.
The forest was at that point more dense,
and thc.soltude more palpable to the feelings.
The path, too, was less defined, and her horse
stepped with his nose near the ground. That
she had mistaken her way, was a conviction
that grew stronger at every step. That she
had ridden far enough to reach the planta-
tion, she could scarcely doubt ; but persons
who begin to feel themselves lost are apt to
persevere in the wrong while there is a single
shadow of hope. She could see no land-
marks to guide her ; she was conscious only
of a black wilderness of trees, which swal-
lowed up her and her maid like atoms of
sand, or two waifs of thistledown.
"aMissus," said the mulatto, with chatter-
ing teeth, "the path am 'tirely gone, an' we's
ridin' 'mong the trees !"
This announcement did not surprise the
worthy spinster, for she was already con-
scious of the fact.
"For once in your life, Meg, you're right.
We've either reached the ead of the path or
lost it. Now don't sit there shakin' like a
jelly, but try and be brave. If you don't,
I'll cut ye up well when we get home," an-
swered Dame Grindle, attempting to spew in
her usual manner.
"Deed, Miss Bessy, if you'll take one
straight hom1e to de plantation, ye may cut
me up and welcome ;dfor, ye see, I can stan
dat, but I can't stan' dis yer."
"Turn your horse, and we'll try and find
the way back to the path," said'her mistress
"Turn de hoss! Lor' lub ye, Miss Bessy
I's turned round ten times in de las' ten miw

An't no use. Might as well swound right
away whar we is as any whar."      -
"Swoon, Meg, if you think you'll get out
of the woods by it ; but I sha'n't give'up
without another trial."
Goody Grindle made repeated and con-
tinued attempts to recover the lost path,; but
every effort involved her in more inextricable
labyrinths, until the points of compass were
hopelessly'lost. It was at this juncture that
Miss Betsey proved herself a woman of nerve
and resolution. Doubt in regard to their
situation having yielded to certainty, she
struggled heroically with her terrors, and
tried onet rationally.
Perceiving that she was quite as likely t
go deeper into the forest as to extricate her-
self from it, she proposed to give the rein to
her horse, and trust implicitly to his in-
stincts. This experiment she at once put in
practice ; and the animal, abandoned to his
own guidance, snuffed the air, and smelled
along the ground, starting off at a moderate
pace. Miss Grindle had not proceeded fir
in this manner, when a shriek from Meg ex-
cited new alarm.
" Hush !" said hers mistress, imperatively.
"Your noise will bring upon us the very
danger that you fear."
"Couldn't help it, missus, 'fI's to die! 'a
heard somgbod walkin' for two, free min-
utes, an' I couldn't squiet myse'f no longer
It am right down drefful, missus ! Dar I
don't ye hear it ?"
"For Heaven's sake, be silent! Your folly
makes me angry! It was but a squirrel run-
ning over thec leaves."
Dame Grindleae'sped the colored girl by
the arm, and held it tightly.
i "There! don't speak above a whisper!"
she added.
"Dear me ! how you does take hold. Dar!
dar 'tis again! S'pect it am de Pine Rob-

bBetsey Grindle certainly heard a noise that
sounded like footsteps not far off.. She set her
fingers more rigidly upon the arm of Meg;
but physical pain could not neutralize or di-
vert her mental disorder; a tell-tale moan
-hastened the dreaded catastrophe. The foot-
steps which had leen uncertain and cautious,
immediately became decided. A figure sud-

the marvel had only begun ; the odd creatu
bits of iron, in company with hammer, tong
and anvil, had a merry dance, to the supreme
worriment of the person who ought to hav
been a corpse, but wasn't.
"Good heavens, old-man ! You might a
well put me in a mortar and pound me, as t
jolt me over the ground in this way ! Th
devil's in that mare !" cried the colonel, pit
eously.
"Yes, she is possessed at times. Used t
call her Mary Magdalen on that account. G
*'long ! Hi !hi !"
The eccentric creature seemed to be trying
to run out of her harness. The trees dashe(
by the cart, apparently like race-horses. A
steeple-chase was nothing to it. 3omerton
was obliged to grasp the sides of a vehicle
with both hands.
"On'y 'leven year old !" shrieked the old
man above the din and clatter. " On'y 'leven

The wounded officer looked up appealingly,
and saw.Hirt sitting unconcernedly on his
perch, with a rein in each hand, his musket
between his knees, and his great cart-whip at
his feet.
The morning sun shone on his hump, mak-
ing it look like a hot shot, or a bomb-shell at
a white-heat.
" People that don't know nothin' 'bout
houses, think she's fifteen ; but I know her
age to a day. I can trace her generology in
a direct line. Her mother was a long, slab:
sided, weasly-lookin' animil, and her sire was
the most vicious 'creetur that ever broke halt-

and there's danger afore, an' ahind, an' all

. Hirl stopped so suddenly, that every article
in the cart, the colonel not excepted, plunged
forward against the head-board. -Shriek after
shriek came from the forest ;'it was a woman's
voice. T'he hunchback sprang;fr'om hips heat
like a rocket, and the colonel saw him running
swiftly to the left, with his musket. His
curiosity rose above -his pains. He saw fig-
ures half hidden by the trees, and the flutter
of female garments. The forms came nearer ;
they were women flying from pursuers, and
the cries he had heard were uttered by them.
The swordmaker flew wildly to meet the
fugitives, who were no other than Dame
Grindle and her maid Meg. The cause of
theirterror was immediately manifest; the
two marauders, Martin and Flander&amp;, were
hotly pursuing them.
" Go on, gals! Go on !" said Hirl, passing
them, and stopping 'behind a tree. "Go on,

re and I'll have a settlement with these skin-
us ners."
's,  "'Tis the swordmaker ! 'tis the sword-
ec maker " exclaimed the suppositious Dame

cap, an  etreated again into the almost myth-
as ical dep hs of her bonnet.
o    "It am de debble,- more like, missus, id
.e all dat yer on his back !" asserted Meg, on
t- whose mind the startling incidents of the
night and morning had made deep impres-
o sion.
o   Both paused, partly from exhaustion, partly
from bewilderment. Possibly they feared that
g the old man could not contend with the two.
d While they stood panting and gazing at the
hunchback with swimming, dizzy incredulity,
 he aimed his musket and fired. When the
e smoke cleared away, neither of the villains
were to be seen, but footsteps' were heard
3 growing every moment less distinct. Judith
thought she heard groans, also, but was too
much disturbed to dwell long upon the subject.
The color receded from her face, andthe
swordmaker hastened to place his arm about
her waist to support her ; for Meg, in a military
point of view, was quite demoralized.
"Strange, strange, that I should encounter
you here !" murmured Judith, sighing and
trembling on the verge of unconsciousness.
" Nothin' extr'ordiner, Goody Grindle. My
trade carries me everywhere e'enamost," an-
swered the swordmaker, drawing Judith closer
to him.
"True! true !"~returned Judith, recovering,
and reinenbering the character in which she
was figuring. " There ! that 'll do, my good
man," she added, returning to the Betsey
Grindle voice and manner.
"Don't waste precious time in holdin' up a
woman when there's no danger of her fallin'."
" In the name of God-" began the sword-
maker, with remarkable earnestness.
Judith looked at him wonderingly.
" I mean - why is this, Goody Grindle ?
What in the name o' reason are you wanderin'
here for? Why ain't ye at home, at the
spire's ?" j
" We's jes' been el'ar done lost," interposed
Meg. " De Lor' only knows what missus has

Golly gracious, how we has been chased !"
The swordmaker trembled like a leaf. I is

indeed  It was well for them it was not made
;'                 too late. Judith sensibly beat a retreat with-

Meg had just enough discretion to keep close
(~  ~4~.to her mistress. The runaway black was cvi.
gently there for no good purpose. He was
either waiting their return, or making a sur-
vey of the premises with a view to plunder
and pillage ; very likely he had both these
objects in contemplation. It was necessary,
to avoid Jaffer, to make a long detour to the
Santee, and this they undertook to do, which
could have been accomplished with time and
patience, had not a new difficulty prevented, t
which took the shape of Christian Hadley and p
a dozen of his lawless followers, who-having t
arrived as near the plantation as' was thought s
safe,*'halted in a growth of express to makea ii
reconnoisance on foot. On account of this t
-        circumstance, mistress and maid found them- t
selves between two perils, neither of which e
were anticipated. They could not traverse w
the open space between- the      sses and 'a
plantation without bemg seen, and they could s
not very well make a circuit around the party L
by reason of a cane-brake in the rear; so be- in
tweenJaffer and Christian Hadley (who was p
not a bit of a Christian),, they were placed in p
a ver   embarrassing dilemma. It may be th

demands of appetite, had not weakness ad-    "
monished them of the fact. Hiding like par- sore
bridges in the bushes, they heard nothing for com

nd time but the thumping of their own hearts.
By-and-by, Judith's natural courage revived,
and she began to debate the best method of
reaching home. It was precarious moving in
any direction ; but Judith felt the imperative
necessity of warning her father and his house-
hold of the calamity that impended. Fears
for her personal safety were in a measure coun-
terbalanced by an unselfish solicitude for her
friends.nShe remembered that she had been
out all night, too, and that the greatest anxi-
ety must ie felt for her safety, which her press
enee would at once relieve.
She watched the cypress-trees and the bot-
tom-land a long time; but Jaffer kept at his
post, and she could see the horses of the
ories grazing near thecanebrake, and a man
standing guard over their movements. Jud-
th commenced a cautious retrograde toward
he wagon-road, where she had parted with
he sword-maker. Meg, though quitedejecth.
d, was guided by her superior judgment
ithout question.. They climbed a hedge,
nd stood in the road. They had gained .
omething,- being farther from both enemies.
looking up the wagon-road, Judith saw a man
n a slouched hat and blue camp-cloak, ap-
roaching with hurried strides. Her firstim-
ulse was, to fly ; but something familiar in
he gait and person of the new-comer cared
er to remain-irresolute. The mflnmsaw her,
vtered an exclamation of surprise, and eager-
* advanced. Various emotions chained her
the spot. She would have been troubled

Guy Deering sprang to her side, and took

" Judith," he said, "this is a pleasure that
did not expect."s              u
"You know me, then, through my die-

the old man Hirl. He gave you the saw, he
refused gold, and a strange emotion shook
him as I appealed to his sympathy for the
spy.,
"It was not an ingenuous question," an-
swered Deering, in a deep and kindly voice,
"to ask concerning this disguise. Yes, Judith,
I know what you have done. The old man
whispered it to me through the cabin wall,
and my admiration and gratitude were such
that I wished to lie down at your feet and die
for you. Did the old churl tell you ?"
"Churl! For shame, Guy! Call him not
such a- name," exclaimed Judith. "He is a
noble old man, and a deep. - He saved you, he
saved Somerton, and he has saved me ."
"1Sich a hoss as dat ycr mare is, nebber was

terposed Meg, who was disposed to be elo-

Guy Deering smiled.
" Those bright eyes were not given the

seriously to Judith, added : " Why are you

clearing, and reach home without delay?

Deering's head sank lower and lower,11
his chin rested upon his chest. He sigh
and looked at Judith as one asking pity a

sciences, what matters our employment ?"
" Leave me, Guy Deering! leave me for-
ever !" cried Judith, with sudden vehemence-.
"Never come into my presence again. You
are infamous ! you are infamous!"
Judith shrank from Deering, shuddering
and angry.
Deenn s face grew pallid.  All the life
seemed to have gone out of his athletic body.

eald and glassy, and fixed vacantly on Judith.

them/; that was what struck him to the heart.
While he felt the steel, he would have kissed
the hand that struck.
Judith grew handsomer, taller, stro _,
prouder, braver, and more adorable. Pres-
ently, Deering raised his hands with the .
palms turned entreatingly to Judith. The
3 motion was teribly eloquent.* She inter-
preted the meaning.
"Spare you? No! Have you spared me?
Have you not turned my love into a curse?

he suggested that he'd "better go and make

He retorted that his trade was not war, but

iss Grindle made answer that she approved
his conduct, and hoped that he would pray

at was worth praying for was worth fighting
r-which sentiments tended to assuage the
fended chaplain.
CHAPTER XVI.
IN WhiCa SOMERTON IS MYSTIFIED.
Somerton was glad to be left alone. The
st twenty-four hours had been with him a
riod of peculiar trial and danger. He had
en wounded, and in the hands of an un-
tying enemy, deprived of those cares which
s situation required, without medical aid,
d stretched upon the cold earth in an ap-
rently lying state. After a perilous and
citing escape, occupying several hours, he
length found himself beneath a friendly
of, upon a soft, inviting couch, with kind,
tentive faces looking in upon him.
The vomluilitJ of the, to him, inexplicable
a  - crindle,*had interested at first, as well
perpiexed him; but, presently, weakness
d sleep overpowered him. Dame Grin-
e's voice seemed to grow lower and low-
and recede in the distance; the hump
the swordmaker looked like a mountain in
mist, so far off that its summit could scarce-
be discerned ; the sergeant vanished with a
overb ; the chaplain went down through
e floor, or up through the roof, like a grim
agon, he could not tell which ; but the form
Judith Redmond now came, now went, now
urned and floated around him fantastically.
he soldier slumbered. The old-fashioned
l marked three hours of time. The dark-
ss of night had set in., A crash of musketry
ade Somerton start suddenly from his sleep.
.e sound called him to duty and to danger.
r a moment, he believed himself at his
arters, in camp, beset by the enemy.
' Mount, boys! mount, and at them !" he
uttered .
A soft hand was laid upon his brow, and
head pressed gently back to the pillow.
.e clouds of sleep were dispelled, and the
ntinental officer beheld a fair creature
endingg over him.
" Is it you? Is it you ?" he murmured.
" Yes, it is I," said a soothing voice.
"Alas! fair girl, you will make more
unds than you will heal!1" sighed. Somer-
n.

" You are pleased to be as gallant in lady's
bower as in the field," answered his charming
nurse.
" I am a soldier, and have not learned the
follies and flatteries of the courtier. My life
is an earnest and precarious one, which the
vicissitudes of my calling may at any time
shorten. I have neither leisure nor disposi-
tion for vain compliments. I trust I shall be
pardoned when I say, that our first meeting
made an impression upon me that I cannot
forget."
The young lady retreated a step, and look-
ed at the colonel, inquiringly.
" What did you observe, sir?" she asked.
"That our short and singular interview
produced feelings, that to me are new and
strange."
" Interv  -A do not comprehend."
His lovely nurse contemplated him as if she
feared he were losing his senses.
"Do not distrust my prudence, Mss Red-
mond. I will keep faithfully your secret; but
it pains me to the heart that your visit had
not a worthier object. I hope it was pity
alone for a human being in distress, that con-
ducted you to one condemned to death, and
branded with deserved infany."
Somerton's voice was low and earnest ; lie
watched Miss Redmond s couintSnace with
feverish anxiety.
"Be quiet, sir; your mind is distempered.
Believe me, all that you are saying is but a
dream. - This. to my knowledge, is the first
time you ever beheld me."
Miss Redmond had the manner of perfect
truth. Somerton's countenance changed.
" I am sorry," he said, with a disappointed
air, " that Miss Redmond should fear to trust
me, and resorts to prevarication with one
whose honor should not be doubled by her."
"I assure you, sir, that there is some mis-
take," she said.
' Mistake ? Impossible ! If I dreamed all
this, I am dreaming still. The dream must
have commenced at my quarters, at the mo-
ment when you came to request permission to
see the spy, Decring. The illusion went on
when Deering denied that he was Deering.
The burning cabin, the surprise, the man
riding at my side, my capture, my wounds,
my sufferings, my escape, were all of a piece,
and arrant deceptions each ! Pray, Miss Red-
mond, may I not be permitted to believe that
you are real, and that this scene belongs to the
waking part of my existence ?"
The colonel raised himself on his elbow,
and fixed his eyes piercingly upon the chang-
ing countenance of Miss Redmond.
"You-you confuse me beyond measure.
I know not what to say ; but rest assured,"
she added, with some hauteur, "that I never

visited Colonel Somerton's quarters for any
purpose whatever, or at any time in my life.
This conceit comes of fever and pain."
"I am mad, perhaps i" answered Somerton,
with an ironical smile.
"It is not singular that your mind should
wander somewhat after the scenes throutch
which you have recently passed," observed
Miss Redmond, quietly.
"I am mocked.!"
" Who mocks you ?"
"Deering, the swordmaker, Dame Grindle,
and you ! Yes, you, you mock me !" exclaim-
ed the colonel, impatiently.
" Nay, nay, good sir ! Be patient, and all
shall be as you say. If it be your pleasure,
I will assent that I have been anywhere you
wish. Be good, and take some of this liquid
which my aunt has prepared for you; it will
benefit you, I am sure."
" I am neither delirious nor wandering,"
replied Somerton, with empressement, " and I
will spare you the trouble, my dear young
lady, of treating me as if I were such. Par-
don me, let me understand you. You were
not at my quarters?"
"Consequently, e was no interview be-
tween us?"
There was not."
"You deny the whole transaction?"
,"I deny what you affirm."
"Then, by Heaven, I am mad !" cried the
officer, with vehemence.
There was another crash of musketry near-
er than before. The house shook-the panes
of glass rattling in the sashes. The well
known dissonance aroused the colonel's mar-
tial ardor.
"That volley was fired by my dragoons!"
be said. "There is a fierce engagement not
far from here. I must fly to my brave fel-
lows. Lend me your arm. Give me my coat
and sword !"
"My dear sir, you are wounded; you can-
not mount horse or wield weapon," remon-
strated the young woman.
I can do both! This couch is a bed of
thorns while I can hear my dragoons at work,
and not be with them."
Thc officer sat upon the bed, his feet rest-
ing upon the floor. le stood up and found
himself weaker than he had expected.
"I will compromise with you," said Miss
Redmond.   " Here is my father's dressing-
gown y put it on, and I will assist you to a
window, where you may see as much of the
conflict as the darkness will permit."'
"I believe I am in your power, Miss Red-.
mond, and I surrendered at discretion ; only
substitute my coat for the gown-for I hate
*dressing-gowns. The sleeve is cut open, but
you can pin it. You comply. Thank you,

miss ! How deftly you women handle us
awkward fellows."
" You love your buttons, colonel, as well as
a young girl her mirror. You are sure you
are quite rational? You won't harm me?"
Miss Redmond, with some lesitation, as-
sisted him to a window that looked toward
the Santee.
"IIHarm her !" muttered the officer, as he
walked by her side.
"Fear not," he said, raising his voice. "I
am rational, and truthful, also," he added, in
an aside tone.
The young woman heard him, and seemed
to feel the implication deeply.
From the window, Somerton beheld an ex-
citing spectacle. Some barns and several
negro huts had been fired, and the flames
lighted up with vividness the space between
Redmond's residence and the river, which was
now the scene of a fierce nocturnal conflict.
Parties of horsemen were seen charging this
way and that, sometimes in the full glare of
the flaming buildings, at others in the faint
and more distant gleam of the fiery illumina-
tion. There was a dropping fire of muskets
and pistols, while sabres clash d, and the re-
sounding notes of bugles rolled across the
field. The combatants swayed and wavered
to and fro. Now the tide of battle flowed
his way, then ebbed back with a sudden im-
pulse. Half-naked negroes were seen run-
ning to and fro in the foreground of the fight,
and riderless horses dashed frantically from
the melee.
Sergeant Giles, the chaplain, and a few
armed blacks, with a half-dozen dragoons,
constituted the sole guard and protection of
Redmond and his household. Dame Grindle's
voice was heard admonishing the slaves to
stand'their ground, and do their duty, on pain
of after penalties.
Colonel Somerton looked out upon the.
chaos of battle a few moments in silence.
"What do you make of it ?" asked Miss
Redmond, timidly.
"Rainford is engaged with the headlong
Tarleton. Those, are his fellows in the bright
coats. They are better fed and clothed than
our lads, but not so hearty. I hate scarlet
coats! There is a sort of vanity in them that
suits John Bull, but which I can never for-
give."
"The dragoons are giving ground ; they
are being overpowered by numbers," said
Miss Redmond.
" Yes, they are yielding ; but they dispute
every inch as they go. There! ~that was
Rainford's shout ; he hurls his dragoons once
more against the heavy ranks of the enemy.
Now, there is hot work ! They slowly re-
treat, pressed backward, by the solid masses
of Tarleton's legion. How vexatious to be

" I didn't say be could, chit! But he could
have it amputated. I'd have my revenge
on't, I'll warrant, if I had it. I'd set the sar-
geons at it, slap dab."
' "It involves the spinal column, aunt," said
Miss Redmond.
"1Who keers for the spiral column ! I
don't. It's Tarleton's columns that I'm afeerd
of. Poor Judith! I'm worried e'enamost to
death about her."
"Judith ?" repeated Somerton, inappre-
hensively.
" Goodness, Miriam! here's more'n forty
holes in the back of your gown. Stand up,
and let me pull it into shape. Odds my life !
how cur'ous! Here's a 1,ttle strip round the
waist as fresh as when it dome out the draw-
er !"
Miss Redmond blushed ; Somerton's arm
had puduced that phenomenon.
"Miriam !" echoed the colonel ; "Miriam !"
"What ails the mau that he keeps repeatin'
things like a Igrrot?  Lord, niece! why do
you tremble so ?"
"I tried to tell you," stammered Miss Red-
mond, greatly agitated-" I attempted to in-
fori you that I was not Judith, but Miriam."
"NotJudith, but Miriam!" echoed' Somer-
ton, dubiously. Then a joyful light broke
.over his countenance.
"-Forgive me! oh, forgive me !  Before
Heaven, I meant not to deceive !" protested
Miriam, hiding her face.
" The deception," ans-vered Somerton, " was
my own. Forgive you? Angels do not sin."
" There isn't an angel in the thirteen colo-
nies !" affirmed Goody Grindle.
" I must differ with you, madam," replied
Somerton.
"How ludickerous to stan' talkin of angels
in a woman's flannel petticoat ! Neither of
my nieces are angels, and they won't be, in a
hurry-though I've seen worse-lookin' gals.
She'd got her wings scorched to-iight if she
had been, Miriam would. They do look mon-
strously 'like ; and if I's a man, I'd lief make
love to one of 'em as 'tother. Much as I can
do to tell 'em apart. It's the fortinest thing
in the world that this one squints a little. I
should be bothered to death to 'stinguish 'em
if she didn't." .h
" Squint, aunt!'*
Miriam looked at Goody Grindle with some-
thing like consternation.
"I haven't observed anything of the kind,"
remarked Somerton.
"Noticed it the fust time I seen her. The
gal's eyes are a good 'eal,out o' plumb-some-
times," corroborated Hirl.
"-Go 'long, you old camef" retorted Dame
Grindl'e. "Child ! child ! vhat makes you
tremble?  What is the matter?    Colonel
Somerton, what have you done to my niece?"

" I have done what mortal man may be
pardoned for doing," he answered, with a
warmth and earnestness that appeared quite
uncalled for to the practical aunt.
" I fear," said Miriam, " that I have forfeit-
ed your esteem." She looked timidly into
his face.
" Pardon me, dame," replied Somerton ;
and, stooping, whispered in Miss Redmond's
ear :
" I swear to you it is the happiest mistake
of my life ! Be assured-be calm. Judith is,
perhaps, beyond my reach; but you, you I-
may hope for. God has not left me to de-
spair.
"There !" said Betsey Grindle, dryly, "I
can understand the phenomeny of the gown
not bein' burnt around the waist !"
CHAPTER XIX.
DEB HADLEY'S CABIN.
We return to Judith, whose sudden and
continued absence had created the greatest
alarm and anxiety among her friends, who
hailed her return with joy- after she had
been escorted by the swordmakcr within a'
short distance of the house.
In answer to the hurried questioning of
her father and aunt, she said that she had
been to 'Somerton's camp; to carry a few ar-
ticles of clothing which Miss Grindle had pre-
pared for the use of the soldiers ; and her ab-
sence would scarce have been remarked had
she not unfortunately become lost in the Pine
Forest, where she passed a night of perplexi-
ty and terror, from which she had, been re-
lieved by the friendly interposition of Hirl,
the Hunchback. She did not of course refer
to Deering ; and therefore, the real design of
her visit remained a secret, as well as the dis-
guise she had assumed. The times were so
fraught with adventure, so crowded with stir-
ring events, that the members of her house-
hold found little time to rebuke her rashness,
or talk of the risk she had incurred. In those
days, stagnation was unknown, and incident
followed incident in rapid succession; and
while Judith was yet engaged in relating such
portions of her mishap as she thought pru-
dent, it was announced by the frightened
slaves that there was trouble in the cypresses.
This, startling as it was, proved a present re-
lief to Judith ; for each hurried, as 'by one
impulse,-to'-positions from which they could
best observe the conflict. Then came Somer-
ton to make a new diversion, and put the phi-
lanthropic fingers of Aunt Grindle to active
service. That officer, having sank into a
slumber, as duly mentioned in the order in
which these events occurred, Judith availed
herself of the temporary lull of indoor ex-
citement, to seek that rest which her weary
and worn condition rendered imperative, while

her sister, Miriam, was left to watch at the
bedside of Somerton.
The din of battle aroused Judith, banished
the idea of further repose, and caused her to
hurry with the other members of the family
to learn the reason of this new and more thrill-
ing interruption. Soon the huts and barns
began to burn ; and she beheld the same
startling spectacle of warring horsemen and
flashing steel that Somerton and his fair
guardian witnessed from the window. Judith
and Goody Grindle were standing upon the
lawn at the left wing of the mansion, when
the attack was made upon Giles and his hand-
ful of dragoons. She was clinging to that
decisive lady, watching with filial interest the
emotions of her father, who, mounted upon a
fine horse, had joined the sergeant, with such
of his slaves as he believed would be of use,
when she was unexpectedly seized by rough
hands, and with Dame Grindle and Meg, hur-
ried to a distance from the house. When the
dragoons began to fall back upon the wood,
-and the scale of battle seemed no longer doubt-
ful, Dame Grindle was released, with many
jests and much merriment at her expense ;
for she had acquired such a habit of talking,
that nothing under heaven but a complete ex-
tinction of her being could stop her, when
fully launched upon the sounding sea of lo-
quacity. Judith and Meg remained with their
captors ; and presently the former saw, with
inexpressible sorrow, the flames curling from
the roof of the paternal ngansion. She thought
of her sister and Somerton, and begged the
ruffians around her to go to their rescue, who
heard her appeals with the utmost insensibil-
ity. While she was making these useless en-
treaties, a man in the uniform of a British of-
fieer approached. It was Christian Hadley,
that to'y-leader, whose name was at that time
held i} universal dread and execration by the
friends of freedom.
Judith knew him.; they had met before, and
parted with anger on his side, disgust and ab-
horrence on hers. He had paid suit to her in
his rough fashion, before he had become so
stained with crime and blackened with vil-
lainy. More than once in the past had he
placed himself in her path, and added terror
to repugnance. Of late, they had not met,
for he had been busy in making himself infa-
mous to all posterity ; while she had seldom
ventured from the paternal roof. As the war
rolled nearer, and finally encircled them, her
fears of Christian Hadley had grown stronger,
and secretly she had long expected a visit
from him at the head of his marauders. The
moment of vengeance and triumph had ar-
rived. The grim partisan stood before her,
not to sue but to command.
Judith saw exultation in his eyes, and knew
too much of his character to attempt to move

him. She fixed her regards upon the burn-
ing house, and affected not to notice him, al-
though she was trembling at his presence.
" Well, Miss Juditi, what do you think of
this?" he asked, with a sneer. She gave him
a haughty, indignant glance--a mute answer
that annoyed him more than words.
" You see the fate of rebellion and rebels,"
he added. "I told you long ago that it would
come to- this, but you spurned the prophecy.
If you'd ,taken my advice, you wouldn't be-
hold to-siight your home in flames, and your
household-scattered."
"Infamous !" murmured Judith.    -
"Infamous ! 'tis mighty well, Miss Red-
mond ! Your pride and scorn become you ;
but both will be humbled.P
" Whatever rigor or cruelty you may offer,
I beg of you not to speak, but to spare me
the sound of a voice that is hateful to me.
To see you and to- hear you, are two misfor-
tunes from which I pray Heaven to deliver
me."
" I am a British officer, Judith Redmond,
and have the king's commission in my pock-
et," returned Hadley, pompously.
"Say, rather, that you are a traitor, a rene-
gade, a marauder, a swamp-robber-anything
but a true and honest man!" cried Judith,
with a warmth of indignation that proved how
deeply she felt the truthfulness of what she
uttered.
" Traitor, renegade, marauder, robber !"
repeated Hadley, with a frowning brow.
"The terms are too mild ; they fall in-
finitely below my meaning," added Judith.
" If I am such-a monster, you have reason
to expect but little mercy from me," said
Hadley, with a menacing look.
" I anticipate from you all that is unmanly,
dishonorable, and evil, if God does not deliver
me from your hands."
" You shall not be disappointed in your
anticipations. I swear it!" replied the cap-
tain, his face reddening with anger.
" I have not tried to excite your compas-
sion, for I know how vain and hopeless would
beo the attempt. I put my trust in One strong-
er than thou. To Him will I make my prayer
and not to thee," answered Judith, impressive-
ly.
" I will not keep you long in suspense.
Men, put her upon a horse. Two of you
mount and attend me."
Miss Redmond, seeing the futility of resist-
ance, allowed herself to be placed passively
upon horseback. She was then escorted from
the scene of the late events by the captain
and two of his fellows-a proceeding much
against her wishes. Meg was taken up behind
one of the men. - Fear had thus far kept her
silent ; but now, finding her tongue, she began
to bewail her fate bitterly.

" We's jes' the same as dead, missus ; el'ar
done killed and murdered by dese yer n
'count tories !" she- said, turning a piteous
face upon her mistress, who made a feeble at
tempt to console her.
" No use to talk dat ar' way, Miss Judith
for dar ain't no sense in it. Dem yer wheels
o' time dat Miss Bessy talk 'bout so much, is
jes' turning' round mighty fast. It wouldn't
s'prise inc an artom, if we's clods of de valle3
afore de risin' of de blessed sun. Jest t'in
o' dat ! An' we's so young, too, and might
live so many years, if they'd on'y let us be!'
The tory behind whom she was seated, per-
ceiving her state of mind, took pleasure in
increasing her terrors during the remainder of
the nocturnal ride, by various appalling threats
and ingenious artifices. This journey lasted
about an hour, and wound eccentrically
through the Pine Woods by a narrow path,
at the expiration of which time they arrived
at a log-cabin, through the crerices of- which
the glimmer of a fire could be seen. Hadley
threw himself from his horse, and knocked
loudly with the hilt of his sword ; which sum-
mons wasinstantly answered by IL woman's
voice within.
"Who are ye, and what do ye want ?  This
is a fine hour to come disturbin' a lone wo-
man, who is neutral to both parties and hasn't
nobody to protect her, them as should be her
defenders bein' out o' the country, and gone
the Lord only knows where, for I don't, though
it's caused me oceans o' trouble and worri-
ment."
How much longer the woman would have
gone on, is pr blematical; for both lungs and
tongue seemed'in excellent order for running
a long time. Hadley interrupted her with :
" Come, come, old lady ! Hold up and be-
lay ; you're wasting a good deal o' breath, for
it is I that knock."
"Is it my son Christian ?" she demanded ;
and instantly there followed a rattling of bolts
and bars, and the door was opened.
Judith had felt somewhat encouraged when
she heard a female voice ; but when its pos-
sessor stood before her, her hope in one, of her
own sex receivegl a shock. Mrs. Hadley was
not a model of feminine beauty, -being of a
large and masculine frame, with an abundance
of bone and muscle,- prominent cheeks, a large
nose, gray eyes, eyebrows, and hair, and a
mouth of unusual calibre, rendered less at-
tractive by the lobs of most of her teeth. The
united expression of the various features of
her face was coarse, -shrewish, and deter-
mined.            -

r This incongruous article of dress was black,

- She held in her right hand a stout oaken stick,
for defence or aggression.

a and what do you bring with Tou'?" she asked.
s   " What have I brought, mother Hadley?

with filial familiarity.
' "Which one is it ?" quoth Mrs. Hadley,

Judith than at Meg. " Is it the yaller or the
white ?"
" This hop-o'-my-thumb little woman is the
f one,; but I warn you that you won't find her
the most 'tractable body in the world. She's
handsome and proud, and hates me, I flatter
myself, as cordially as a young lady ever hat-
ed her future husband," replied the captain,
I making a bearish attempt at playfuhiess.
" Hoity-toity !" exclaimed Mother Hadley,
placing her aims akimbo, and looking sharply
I at her prospective daughter-in-law. " Hate
my son Christian? How dare a gal hate my
son Christian ? How smart he looks in his
new regimentals ! A reg'lar officer, too, in
the British Armv., - Tote her in !"
Judith, who had'dismounted, was now cob-
ducted into the cabin, tremblin 'with fear.
"You are a woman," she E id. addressing
Mrs. Hadley, " and I throw myself upon your
protection. Shield me from hese wretches,
and heaven will' reward you for your kind-
ness."
" Wretches? That's what I call a sharp
beginning, I vow ! Wretches, indeed! Debo-
rah Hadley don't have no wretches about her
primises. Lord, Chris ! what did you bring
sich a baggage as this here for? I'll die if
'tisn't one o' Squire Redmond's darters ; and
the' Redmonds are the rankest rebels in the
country. Now, no son o' mine shall marry a
rebel !"
"It's no use talkin', mother ; I took a shine1
to lher long ago, and my mind hasn't been set-'
tIed and happy since. I know that she scorns
me, but I can't help it ; the more she disdains
me, the more I'm fascinated. If I ha e her

"Yes, mother," said the partisan, and
looked wishfully at Judith, who was bearing
this scene with what philosophy she could.
Possibly he felt a faint hope that she would
say something encouraging. If he did, he
was disappointed ; for she remained silent
and unobservant of him. His face was first
mournful, then angry ; he stalked from the
house with an oath, followed by his two at-
tendants. Judith heard them mount their
horses and gallop away. She was glad ; the
sound of their departing steps gave her inex-
pressible relief. She was left with one of her
own sex, and to her ingenuous and hopeful
disposition, it seemed impossible that she
could not melt Mother Hadley's harshness.
Time was worth too much to waste, and she
assailed the woman's better nature at once
with every moving argument that she could
think of; but she was made of sterner'stuff
than she had imagined, and her eloquent ap-
peals fell fruitless on the flinty substance of
her heart. She grew irate, at length, and
showing her a couch, peremptorily ordered
her to bed and to sleep.
- The log cabin was a common affair in those
days, and made a very comfortable home for
the early settlers. Mother Hadley's was di-
vided into two compartments ; one for sleep,
the other for all the ordinary purposes of life.
" Go in, gal-go in I" said Captain Deb, de-
cisively, pointing to the door of the first-men-
tioned room. " Go in, and #ream of bein' a
lady and the wife of my son, Christian, with
his royal red, and his long sword, with plan-
tations and slaves, and the confidence of the
king."
There was no help for Judith. The wo-
man's strength and determination overcame
her weakness and weariness. She and Meg
were pushed into the narrow room. It had
not even a window to admit the light of the
sun, or of the moon and stars. Tle slender
tallow candle which Mrs. Hadley left them
burned dimly, making dark and fluctuating
shadows on the walls.
Meg and Judith seated themselves upon
the bed, and looked at each other inquiringly
"We's done gone lost," said the former en
couragingly. "The Continental boys is whip-
ped,\the red-coats hab got de whole world, de
plantation is burned up, Mas'r Redmon' i
gone de Lor' on'y knows where, Missy Mirian
and de colonel am cl'av perished, and de Lib
erty am jes' nowhere 1"
Judith did not answer the lanentations o
Meg, 'simply because she knew not what t
say. She allowed her to go ofl, and gathe
all their griefs into one mournful heap.
" Whar's de use talkin' 'bout freedom

house to live in, an' plenty to eat and drink,
an' a squantity o' good clothes to wear, and I

Meg rocked herself to and fro on the bed,
and grieved over the fallen fortunes of the
Redmonds.
" Where's de hominy and de cornnkea?
where's de bacon and de egg? where's dd

plantation? Who'll take keer o' de corn, do

does, with a crown o' gold on his head, and a
power o' money. Better gib up, missus, an
turn tory wid de rest of 'em. I'm done gone
an' made up my mind to be a Britisher."
The door was heard to open in the other
part of the cabin.
" Be quiet,"said Judith. Both put their
eyes to a crevice to see who came, and both
were shocked at the sight of Jaffer, the run-
away, on the threshold. Captain Deb con-
fronted him with her oaken staff, erect and
stern. Clearly, his looks did not please her.
He was laboring under strong excitement, un-
armed, apparently, but sufficiently terrible
in his half-nakedness.
The two looked at each other a moment in
silence, as if each were trying to. discover the
1 vulnerable points of the other.
" What sent ye'?" demanded Captain' Deb.
" And why do ye open doors and come in
'thout knockin', like a prowling' thief of the
night?"
Jaffer cast a sullen, half-menacing glance
at Mother Hadley, shut the door, and slipped
the large wooden bolt into its place. His
person was now fully revealed, and formed as
- unpleasant a picture as the, eye could well
e rest upon. There were wounds and scratches
s on his hands, arnms, and face, which added
n much to the grimness of his aspect. Mrs.
- Hadley maintained her ground, but held her
staff more firmly.
f " Are you a dumb devil.?" she added, sharp-
o ly. " Has your thick tongue forgotten hu--
r man speech ?"
"She's here ; Cap'n Chris brought her."
?   He looked eagerly aboutthe room.
e   "Who's here, thick-head !" asked the wo-
it man, fearlessly.

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE:

OR, HIRL THE HUNCHBACK.

'Tother one's burnt up," replied*the negro, in
a muttering, jerking voice.
" There's no' Judy' here ; not for you, least-
wise. So if that's the arrand you come on,
you can turn and go back, and say Deb Had-
ley sent ye."
" Seed the cap'n take her from de planta-
tion. -Black Jaffer follered-tracked him like
a dog--run like a wolf with his nose to de
groun'. Cap'n stop here--leave Judy-go
way."
Jaffer glowered ferociously at Mrs. Hadley.
" What have you to do with my son Chris-
tian, with his sword, and his shoulder-knots,
.and his royal red? What have you to do
-with white natur, any way, white female natur
in partie'lar ? Out o' my cabin ! out into the
night, which is your own brother, and'into the
.swamp, which is your habitation.''
"Th er ! in yer !" growled Jaffer, pointing
to the door, the other side of which stood Ju-
dith and Meg, trembling with apprehension.
Mrs. Hadley promptly placed herself be-
tween the black and the point indicated by
his sooty finger.
" She's fbr my son Christian, and you'll
pass over my body to git her. I know your
malice, that you hate the Redmonds, and have
.sworn vengeance on the whole family; but
you'll do no murderin' and devil's-work here.
I'm Deb Hadley, and if you harm me, my son
Christian will hang ye higher than the seven
stars."
Imagine the sensations of Judith and Meg !
This danger crowned all the terrors of the,
night. They trusted in the prowess of the
brave woman, who was manifestly disposed to
resist the ruffian to the last.
The black stared at his antagonist a full
minute without moving a muscle of his great
body ; then chuckled, and looked inquisitively
around the room, as if in search of something.
His eyes stopped on a stout piece of rope
trailing from a peg near the door. Nearly
.over his head where he was standing, was a
strong iron hook, with a leg of venison sus-
pended' upon it, which he detached and flung
upon the floor. Seizing the rope, he made
one end fast to the hook, and formed a run-
ning noose of the other., His expression dur-;
ing this time was indescribably sinister, and
his sidelong glances at the woman were full of
evil.
"What now, Satan ?"
"He, heI ho, ho ! hangin' is the thing.I
Glad ye mentioned dis ver !"
"You're drunk, beast:!" retorted Mrs. Had-I
-ley, who felt uneasy, but was careful not toi
exhibit signs of shrinking.E
-" You's seen rebels hung, ole woman; good
for dem-good for you, too. He, he ! Jafferi
'hang Cap'n Deb, an' live here hisself !"

His nostrils dilated, and his eyes rolled in
his head with frightful glee.
"You're a fool !" said Mrs. Hadley. "You
can't hang a person there; the rope is too
long. Put a woman of my size in that noose,
and her feet would touch the floor."
" Come along," growled Jaffer, ." or I'll
throw ye on the fire and burn ye ! tie easy
this yer way ; hard t'other."
This, to him, novel way of hanging Mother
Hadley having once entered 'his head, grew
every moment stronger. No power could
have persuaded him to abandon his purpose.
He felt a phrenzied delight in the perspective
struggles of the woman who presumed to op-
pose his despotic will. That he could carry
out his diabolical design without a sharp con-
test, did not appear possible ; but that was an
item that the black had evidently felt no anxi-
ty about. He trusted to his great physical
strength, and the terror he could inspire by
menaces.
Daipe Hadley had been quietly studying
the human animal, and laying plans in agree-
ment with her conclusions. She saw his mus-
cles quivering with strength and impatience,
and knew that the crisis could not be long de-
layed. She thought of her son, Christian,
and listened anxiously to hear the- tramp of
his horse. To attempt to reason with the
being before her, she knew u as out of the
question.
" You may strangle me, Jaffer; yet, I won't
give up the gal that my son, Christian, told mc
to keep. But I never was hanged in my life,
and I don't know how to be no more 'n a child.
I've give you shelter many a time, and food
to eat when you's well-nigh famished ;' and I
hope you won't be cruel, with an old body
that never harmed ye. There's a drop o'
good liquor in that keg there ; take a sip on't,
and maybe it'll warm and soften your heart."
Jaffer caught the vessel, drained "it, and
hurled it through .the only window the cabin
possessed.
"Now for it, ole woman !" he shouted, put-
ting on all the ferocity of his repulsive fea-
tures.
"Not a bit on't, till you shorten the rope,
and tell me how it's done. If I've got to go,
I don't want to make a botch on't."
Jaffer wound a portion of the rope around
the hook, and pushed a chair under it.
" This way, you witch ! this way ! He, he !
ho, ho !"
He stepped into the chair, thrust his curly
head through the noose, and glared with fiend-
ish exultation at Mother Hadley. The chair
sank from under him; there was a creak and
a crash, and Jaffer hung suspended by the
neck.
Mrs. Hadley had touched a secret spring,

and a trap-door had fallen downward into a
cellar beneath the cabin. le was heavy, and
a sudden descent of three feet gave him a ter-
rific shock, confused his faculties, and drew
the cord chokingly tight. He quivered an in-
stant, clutched at the rope, and tried to gather
his limbs up to obtain a. footing upon the
floor; but, as often as he touched it, Captain
Deb pushed him back with her staff. He
lifted his body with his hands, and begged
piteously for relief.
"0 Lord, misses! 0 Lord! I's only fun-
nin'! Le' mai down-le' me down, an' I'll
go right away, an' neber, neber come back!
) good Cap'n Deb ! 0 good Cap'n Deb!"
In -answer to this appeal, Mrs. Hadley be-
stowed such hearty thwacks upon his fingers
that they relaxed their hold, and his arms fell
convulsed at his side.
"'Funnin', was ye ? you black Satan! Well,
I'm .funnin' now. How do ye like it, ch ?
Hanging' is fine sport, isn't it?"
Jatfer roared, begged, and struggled. His
gigantic frame writhed and quivered 'fright-
fully.
J adth and Meg beheld the shocking spec-
tacle with awe and astonish ent. When, in
the agony of suffocation, h made attempts
to grasp the rope, the remorseless staff of Deb
Hadley beat down his arms.
Judith could scarcely command her emo-
tions, and turned from the sight dizzy and
faint. The gasping respiration of the black
finally ceased ; his breast' no longer heaved ;
his limbs subsided into quietness, and he hung,
without motion, a dark and revolting object.
CHAPTER XXI.
IN WmICII A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS PERFoRMED.
" The race is not to the swift nor the battle
to the strong," moraligd Deborah Hadley, as
she surveyed the gigantic form of Jaffer.
" The brute had strength, but not the cunnin'
to match a woman. He was an idle, vicious.
prowlin' cur, as likely to shed royal as rebel
blood. Well, I've saved the hangman trouble
and done the country a sarvice. Heart alive !
how I tremble ! I haven't been so nigh my
cend in a long time. But I didn't give her
up ; no, I kept her for my son Christian.
'Twas white natur ag'in black natur, and the
white has carried the day. Well," she con-
tinued, looking at the remains of Jaffer, " the
creetur 'pears to be quite done for. The fool !
to try his wit ag'in Deb Hadley."
The clatter of iron-shod feet was heard.
" It's my son Christian !" said the old wo-
man. "If he has ridden far, he has ridden
fast. This won't be a pooty sight for him on
his weddin'-night, so I'll put it out o' the way."
She cut the rope with a knife, and the body
of Jaffn r fell heavily into the cellar.- She drew
up the door and fastened it. Why the trapI

was constructed in that peculiar manner, with
a stout hook over it, can only be guessed at.
If some of the dark - secrets of that period
could be told, conjecture would doubtless yield
to certainty, and the uses of that contrivance
would cease to be a mystery.
By the time Mrs. l1adley had concealed all
evidence of her work, her son entered the
cabin, followed by a man dressed in a suit of
shabby black, which appeared much too small
to fit his person, wluch was, rather tall and
athletic. His hat was in keeping with the
rest of his externals, showing 'signs of recent
brushing and smoothing. The frayed edges
of the brim seemed to have been polished
with blacking, to keep up its sombre respect-
ability. His neck-cloth was of white cotton,
and of remarkable width. His hair was long,
straight, nearly of flax color, and soberly put
away behind his ears. His whiskers, which
were rather sparse, were of the same hue, and
were noticeable because not generally worn
by clergymen at that time. His face was pale
and lugubriously solemn. Clearly, the man
thought the universal world was going to
wreck and ruin as fast as was conveniently
possible.
He carried a prayer-book in his hand, and
appeared ready for any emergency in the
legitimate way (f his profession. His gaze
wandered somewhat hurriedly around the
room, as soon as he found himself within it,
finally resting, with mild dignity, on Deborah
Hadley.
" Well, mother ?" said Christian.
" All safe an' snug, my soger-boy."
"Nothing has happened '" queried the cap-
tain, with hesitation.
" Much has happened, but the gal is thdre.
I'm sorry you haven't set your mind on a
willin' bride ; but what is, must needs be, and
what has happened, we must abide by," quoth
Mrs. Hadley.
" Verily, I am glad, sistEr Iladley, that thy
mind is so seasoned with grace," said the par-
son, "for resignation is one of the principal
virtues of a Christian. Sure-ly it is refresh-
ing to meet with one, in these degenerate
times, in whom the word is not the savior of
death into death, but of life unto life. I trust,

. "Still, madam, I may entertain a hope that
the seed, in your case, has fallen on good
soil. and brought forth the peaceable fruits of
righteousness," lie continued, in an edifying
tone.

Nerved with sudden strength, Judith arose,
and made a step toward the fugitive.
"I hear the tramp of horses. Fly, wretched
man, fly !" she cried.
"Fly !" he repeated, turning to her with a
bitter smile. " As well might an eagle skim
the air with a broken wing ! I am'hunted
down, have reached this cox cr, and can go no
farther."
Deering rested against the wall for support.
" They come ! they come !" said Judith
and, springing to the door, pushed the stout
bolt to its place.
" Well done, darter-in-law! 'tis a brave be-
ginnin' !" said Mrs. Hadley, approvingly.
Judith glanced at Deering, to see if his
count nance changed ; but lie did not appear
to heed the woman's remark.
"Will you hide me !" cried Deering ; " or
will you see me murdered ?"
e1Ye-, yes ! we will hide you," replied Ju-
dith. " Good woman," she added, " for Heav-
en's sake, conceal him !"
"If you mean it, gal, it can be done ; but
-       it will depend on you, and I a'n't sartin that
I can trust ye. Them that are coming' are
your friends, and how do I know but you'll
.tell ,I for the sake o' your own liberty, and
'ctraY this poor Id to death."
Judith was in a painful dilemma, but quick-
ly decided, between herself and her lover,
whose earnest eyes were upon her.
"If it rests with me, I swear to you that I
will save him !" she solemnly answered.
"Will you'trust her, lad ?" demanded Deb.
"With my life-with my salvation !" he
exclaimed.
The spurs of the dragoons were heard rat-
tling upon the ground as they dismonted,
mingled with the clanking of their heavy
sabres.'
"rFollow!" said Mrs. Hadley, seizing the'
candle, and striding into the sleeping-room.
Approaching the bed, she stripped it in an
instant to its straw-mattress.
"Jump into the middle, lad, and lay down
as close as if you's ready for the undertaker."
"I obey !" said Deering, stretching himself
upon the'mattress.           I
"Play dead well, or dead you'll be," said
the woman, tossing the feather-bed upon hin
as if it were light as air. Smoothing it down,
she laid the pillows and spread the coverings
t    deftly.  The last hurried touch given,- she
threw back the sheets, and snatching  a white
cap from a nail, thrust it toward Judith, as if
her arm was a spear to transfix her.
The girl's face grew deadly pale.
"Put it on !" hissed Deb, with terrible
energy.
While Judith stood hesitating and mute,
there was a thunderous knocking at the door.
" It's life and death," muttered Deb ; and,I

seizing the cap from Judith's paralyzed hand,
drew it over her dark curls, knotted it under
her chin,*then lifting her in her determined
and masculine arms, placed her upon the
bed, and drew the coverings over her. She
next caught Meg with no dainty grasp, and
seated her on the bed beside her mistress.
" Open ! open !" shouted the voice of Ser-
geant Giles. " Open, old hag, or I'll beat
your nest down about your ears.
" Gal," said Mrs. Hadley,-sternly, looking
at Judith, " if you've got narves, show 'em.
If you play the fool and the coward, he is
lost. Meg! sit still, and do as your mistress
tells ye. If questioned, let her answer ; and
what she says, say you."
" Down with the door-down with it !
roared Giles, whose stock of patience was now
entirely exhausted.
"Comin'! coming! " cried Deb, at the top
of her voice.
"Comin'! coming! " mimicked Giles. "Hur-
ry up, then, old magpie !" Mrs. Hadley de-
liberately opened the door, and, standing di-
rectly in it, demanded the, cause of the dis-
turbance.
" Stand aside, and you shall know our er-
rand soon enough," answered Giles. The
latter and Humphrey immediately drew their
swords, and pushed into the cabin.
. "Keep a good watch outside there, Tom
Thornton," said the sergeant. " If he tries
to escape through the window, cut him down
with your sabre ; if from the roof, shoot him
with your musket."
"Stop, my rough soger-lad, and tell me
why you rush, into a lone woman's cabin in
this blusterin' fashion?" said Captain Deb,
nothing daunted.
" A white glove," quoth the sergeant,
" often conceals a dirty hand, and a danure
face sometimes conceals a deal of wickedness.
Our time is short, and we can't waste it in
idle tulk with a witch-wife like you. We have
reason to think that you have given shelter
and concealment to one of the most danger-
ous men on the Santee."
Giles looked at Mother, Hadley, as if his
eyes were corkscrews to draw out secrets with.
She met his gaze with the utmost steadiness.
" Who might he be?' she inquired.
"The person we seek," said the chaplain,
" is probably no stranirer to you. Do not
keep us, waiting, but deliver him up at once,
that he may suffer even the -fate of Haman."
".Of whom do ye speak ?" demanded Deb.
"Woman of Belial, do not practice vain
and unavailing evasions ; for I do assure you
that we shall search every part of your dwell-
ing so thoroughly that not so much as a mouse ,
in the wall shall escape our eyes," returned
Humphrey.

less affected by the grizzly spectacle ; he was
visibly glad to see the trap closed.'
" It would appear," said the chaplain, " ifi
human eyes are to be trusted, that a fellow-
creature has here met his death."
"Fellow-creature !" repeated Giles, with at
strong expression of contempt. " You don'tI

mond's plantation, and a great villain he's
been. Vow, parson, we'll search my lady's
bower."
"You'll find as good a lady there as any in
the land !" retorted Mrs. Hadley. " And she'd
been in her innocent dreams afore this, if you
hadn't disturbed her by your thumpin', and
clatterin', and ill-manners giner'ly."
" Chaplain, look well to yourself when a
woman blusters. Open the door, Mistress
Deb ; I must c'en peep into this sanctuary of
beauty."
"a Spare your jokes, sergeant, for you'll
need allyour small shot when the Royal Amer-
icans start ye from your cover. The time was
when Deb Iladiley was as comely a gal as you'll
find in a whole colony of sieh. Beauty is but
skin deep, but wit reaches to the brain. 'Tisn't
for sick as you, sergeant, to be runnin' your
nose into the sleepin' rooms of young women
daintily brouht up."'
" Fling down the nests, and the rooks will
'be gone; so stan' aside, mistress, or oblige us
by givin' that door a fling, that we may have
a stare at that same innocence you have spo-
enf"
"1If ye must be rude, open the door your-
self; but I warn ye, if you insult the young
woman, you'll have to account for it to more
nor one."
The sergeant, having no great confidence in
Deb's veracity, and little reverence for beauty,
did not pause to pull the latch-string, but
burst open the door with a stroke of his foot.
His first emotions on entering must have been
pretty-lecided, for he stopped short and stood
as motionless as one of the old-fashioned bed-
posts, and quite as stiff. The chaplain, press-
ing hard upon him, looked over his shoulder,
while Deb brought up the rear like a veteran
grenadier.I
Judith raised herself a little in the attitude
of alarm ras the sergeant came in ; and it was
at her that that continental hero was gazing.
"How, - in the namedofvHeaven " lie ex-
claimed, " came this dove in this hawk's
nest ?"
" Comparisons," quoth Mother Hadley,
" are ojus. She's here under my ruff, and I'm
her lawful protector."

i" The countenance," said Humphrey, "is
fair and not altogether unfamiliar to my eyes ;
it should be, methinks, one of the daughters
of Squire Redmond."
"Both should band is ; and this is Meg,
the yeller gal that came to the camp with
Miss Grindle. Why one or the other is here,
is more'n I can tell," answered Giles, in some
perplexity.
pr Good friends," said Judith, " what means
this intrusion ? Is it any service to the coun-
try that my privacy should be intruded
upon ?"
"The sin of ignorance is winked at ; and
we dreamed not that a darter of Squire Red-
mond's would be found in this den of toryism
-this resort of Christian Hadley's maraud-
ers," replied the sergeant.
" Since you know that I am here, there can
be no further excuse for remaining. ;The
events of this night have already greatly dis-
turbed me, and truly I need repose. Should
you meet my father, tell him that I am safe."
" If God wills, I shall soon see him ; for he
is with Rainford, in a thousand troubles about
his darters. Tell me, Miss Judith, what be-
came of Somerton ? Was he consumed in the
house, or taken by the enemy ?"
"Much I fear that the unfortunate colonel,
together with my sister, Miriam, perished in
the flames.  Judge, then, sergeant, of the
state of my mind, and leave me."
" Pardon me, young lady," said Humphrey,
" and allow me to ask you if you are here of
your own will ?"
The eyes of Judith and Deborah Hadley
met. The girl was painfully troubled.
"Seeing how comfortably I am provided
for, I think you might solve that question
yourself," she said, evasively.
"She come here like a bird with broken
wings, and it would been a harder heart nor
mine to refuse her shelter. I took her in and
laid her in my own bed, and tried to comfort
the poor thing,; for much she stood'in need
on't," asserted Deb.
" Woman," said Giles, " if you've done this,
you've changed your nature ; and it'11 turn
out, in my opinion, that there's some diviltry
afoot that honest folks don't understan'."
Judith stole a grateful look at the sturdy
Giles ; she heard the stifled respiration of
Deering, andhsilently prayed that the scene
might be shortened. She felt a choking sen-
sation in her throat, and feared she should
faint, unable to sustain such a trying part.
She waved her hand for her two unwelcome
visitors to depart.
"A thousand pardons, Miss Redmond, but
we mustn't forget duty even for beauty. We
believe that Guy Deerin' is somewhere in this
cabin ; hence the cause of our intrusion. We
are makin' thorough search. Chaplain, look

in that box and behind them clothes. I'll
peep under the bed and feel about'with my
sabre a little, jest.for form's sake ; for Cap'n.
Rainford'11 question us up close, havin' 'made
up his mind to give the spy a good hangin',
sooner or later."
"Don't come no nigher Miss Judy !" said
Meg, menacingly. - " I'll -write the, ten com-,
mandments on yer face, if ye do !"
"My yeller charmer, your mistress is as,
safe as if she's in heaven," answered the ser-
geant, gallantly, stabbing thewall under the,
bed with his'sword.
", Odds my life ! what a brave rebel 'tis !
He's hackin' to chips the royal logs of the
cabin. A rigiment of sich would carry' the
house by storm !" sneered Mrs. Hadley, lift-,
ing her gray eyebrows and putting her arms
akimbo.                      .
Judith was nearly ~dying with suspense.
Love, fear, and timidity struggled. within her.
"Rail op,'woman," answered Giles, quietly,.
transfixing a petticoat with his sabre. "Your,
tongue is the worst part of ye, and'll never be
still till your feet p'int up'ard."
"It's the heart, man-it's the heart that's
desperately -wicked," corrected the chaplain.,
"As Paul says-"
11No matter what Paul says ; it's wlhat Rain-
ford says that I care about !" retorted Giles,
who now stood in the door, applying persua-.
sive friction to his head.
" Cruel, cruel soger-boy ! What a, wicked
wound- you've give my bettermost petitidiot,"
mocked Mrs. Deb, with a laugh that was; pe-
culiar both for its silence and significance..
The sergeant hung his head and walked.
thoughtfully from the little compartment, the
chaplain preceding him.
"Keep rubbin' your head, sergeant dear,
and you'll make it allstraight anon. There's
no harm in pokia' about the beds of timor-
somIe gals, and there's glory in stablin'.inno-
cent gowns and petticoats with your sabre !"
" Humphrey," said Giles, abstractedly; '" I,
a'n't satisfied.' That Guy.Dcein' come in, I
feel sart'in ; but that he's gone out, I'n "not
so sure. Come into'the open air, Humphrey,
and we'll- hold a council o' war.' Alb right
there, Tom Thornton ?"                '-
" All right !" responded con.,  '' '
" The butcher looked for his knife when he
had it in his moufb," moralizedthb'dsergeant,
and with Humphrey left the'e4bin ' The two
were heard conferring earnestly togetherr out-
side, while those within awaited 'the' result,
with all-those varied emotions which their re-.
spective positions rendered natural. 
CHAPTER XXIII.:'
. IN THE CELLAR.
Judith sprang from the bed the moment
the door closed upon Giles and Humphrey.

'" You have acted well'!' said Deborah Had-
ley. "Be quiet a few minutt s longer. There's
a wind-mill in the sergeant's head thnt' may
turn him round one revolution too many.
I've got ears as well as another, and must try
to, catch a word'of that buzzing' ; for a word
to the wise is sufficient."
The woman went softly to that side of the
cabin where the voices could be heard most
distinctly. Crouching upon the floor, she put
her ear to the wall. The sergeant and his
-companion were but a few feet distant. The
latter was satisfied with the search ; not so
with -the former ; a mischievous spite was
whiispcring suspicion.
" It stands to reason," he said, If that a man,
be he British or' American, royalist or rebel,
cannot sink into the earth or fly into the air.
Parson,';I've a feelin' that we've been in some
way carcumvented.'
"You were always a fellow of dull and
heavy comprehension, and like a vicious
horse, -ever ready to take the bit in your teeth
and go your, own way ; had it been otherwise,
you would long ago have been a subject of
grace," Humphrey answered.
"11'm nobody's' subject !" retorted Giles.
" I cast off my allegiance when I took up arms
'for Congress."
"'Twould be well for you to remember,
sergeant, that we're far from our broken and
battered brigade, and'our' return likely to be
cut off at any moment by straggling parties
of _tories, or the impetuous fire-eaters of
Tarleton. We've done all that, any one could
reasonably expect. As Paul says-"
- " As I've told you, parson, it is what Rain-
ford says' that I care for, and I would thank
'you to mention no other commander in my
hearin' ; although the officer that you speak
of may be very'good in his way. There's a
little insect in my ear that worries me. I
can't go away content till I've taken another
look. , I was a little too tender of the feelin's
of Miss Redmond ; and, by-the-way, Humph-
rey, I've heerd that there's somethin' atween
her and this same Guy Deerin'; though I
hope to the Lord it isn't true. As a thorough
soger, I should have passed my sabre Aown
through that bed a few times, with all delica-
cy and deference to the fair gal restin' like a
snow-flake on one side on't."
". Truly, thou art wanting in respect to the
sex. It-would frighten the poor child within
an inch of her life to see you thrusting and
lunging at harmless beds and bolsters. Veri-
ly, the 'profession of arms has hardened thy
heart." -
The chaplain clanked his sabre, and, beside
the sergeant, was as Goliah to David.
" Let not your tongue cut your throat ; for
you know there isn't a redder sabre in the
sheath than yours. In battle, you are Satan,

and all the rest of the time a saint. Saddle the
right horse, my man ! As for respect, to the gal,
I'll show her as much as if the's my own
sweetheart. She loves Congress and Washin'-
ton; and if I say 'In the name of CongrEss,
or in the name of Washin'ton,' it will be both
law and gospel. Did you notice, Humphrey,
that the gal had a wide-awake look, and was
sometimes white and sometimes red in the
face? Is it common, too, for young women
to go to bed with their day-clothes on ? And
mark you, sir ! I saw a little slipper peepin'
from beneath the bed-coverings, which strikes
me i out o' the common order, and ag'in na-
tur'."
Humphrey mused, throwing his weight upon
one limb, and then upon the other.
" In the excitement, confusion, and terror
of these times, the common usages of life are
often violated ; however, if you think it best,
'we'll return and go over our work again."
" A thing that is worth doing, is worth
doing well. Let us move off a few steps, and
then come back of a sudden ; if there is any-
thing in the wind, we may find them off their
guard."
The two men walked out of ear-range, but
Deborah Hadley had heard sufficient.- Judith
had observed her attentively, and now gath-
ered from her expression that there was new
danger.
"Come out, lad, come out !" she cried.
"They're coming' back!"
Deering sprang from his hiding-place,
where he had been half smothered. Drops of
moisture were onhis brow. He gave Judith a
look of unspeakable gratitude.
" Sweet girl, I owe you life !" he murmur-
ed, as he passed her in obedience to a signal
from Deb, who 'opened the trap-door.
" Why is this ?" asked Judith. "Was he
not safer where he was ? If so, to save human
life-"
" No, no! The s ispicions of the sergeant
are, already directed to the bed ; he'll probe
every inch on't with his long sabre."
"'Anal if he goes into the cellar, discovery
will be equally certain,"- said Judith, in much
alarm.
" Distress not yourself, dear young lady,
for one who lives in' daily expectation of a
violent death ; one who has counted the cost,
and will not shrink from the payment when
the bill of mortality becomes due. It is plea-
sant 1o know that I have your sympathy, and
that   withstanding I am infamous in Miss
Redn   l's eyes---"
" C  e, for Heaven's sake ! your enemies
are at'the door. Down! down! and God in
his mercy save you."
"The door is fastened," said Mother Had-
ley. " I can delay them a minute." She
thrust the fitful candle through the opening
6

f: i

,f

in the floor. " Look !" she continued, coldly
and firmly. " Behold that carcass ; a devil
once lived in it, but has gone out, not by
fasting nor prayer, but by the rope. Jump
down, and hide under that black lump of
mortality. Pull his great body and limbs over
you. Do not fear him; he is more harmless
now than for any time these twenty years.
Shrink not-all are of a color in the dark."
The spy threw a look of ineffable meaning
at Judith, and sprang into the vault.
" It never shall be said," muttered the wo-
man, " that Deb Hadley hasn't done what she
might for a friend in trouble."
- Then to Miss Redmond :
"Back to bed, gal, back to - bed lDon't
fear their swords, for your person's, as safe
with em, for that matter. as 'twould be at your
own h'arth-st one. Behave as well as you did
afore, and we'll outwit 'em, yet. Meg, you im-
age ! in with your mistress, and see that your
tongue keeps its place."
She closed the trap. The sergeant was by
this time kicking at the door.
" Who's come now ?" demanded Mrs. Had-
ley, ill-humoredly.
" Them that hasn't seen fit to go; so slip
the bolt, Cap'n Deb, and don't keep two hon-
est men on the wrong side of the door."
Deb bustled to the door with an affectation
of promptness, and pulled some seconds at the
bolt.
" Be patient, my dears ; it'll start presently.
There-here it comes !"
" She is too affectionate ; the wolf has crawl-
ed into the lamb's skin !" grumbled Giles.
" Don't mind disturbin' a lone woman, or
frightenin' to death poor Miss Redmond. Don't
be partic'lar, sergeant, because in war-time
murder, an' robbery, an' fright go for nothin'.
Spin this thing out as long as you can, for
presently my son 9hristian'll be here, with his
Royal Americans, and his long sword by his
side."
"The quicker he comes, the better!" re-
torted the chaplain, grasping, suddenly, the
hilt of his sabre.
"Pestilent hypocrite ! you're throwed off
your guard now an' then !" exclaimed Deb,
with an abrupt return of her fierceness. " I
know what ye come for, ye rebel hounds ! The
gal's in there ; go and murder her, if ye like ;
but remember that her father's a rebel and
she's of your own way o' thinkin'."
" Nobody talks o' murder, old woman !
'Tisn't the Continental boys that make war on
women and abuse .helpless gals. Away, you
sparrow-hawk !" answered Giles, gruffly. He
then raised his voice, and added: "'Tis I,
Sergeant Giles, Miss. Redmond. Don't be
afeard. The liberty boys know their friends
as well as they do their enemies. God knows
we wont disturb ye more'n we can help, but

the fact is, we a'n't yet satisfied. Rainford is
a devil pf a feller when his blood's up, and
you wouldn't want me faulted, I'm sure, jes'
for neglectin' to murder the bed with my
sabre."
Giles gently opened the door leading to the
suspected quarter.
" I had hoped," said Judith, complainingly,
"that after the terrible excitements of this
eventful night, I should be permitted a few
moments of undistrbed repose."
The pale face of Judith, the mournful se-
verity of her words, taken in conjunction with
her surroundings, brought Giles to a full-stop.
" Poor, dear lamb ! She can't stan' dis yer
muc'h longer !" whined Meg, dolorously. " De
life's jest about gone out her precious body.
I wish to de Lor' dar wa'n't no Congress an' no
liberty !"
"I beg prdon,miss-I really don't mean-
that is, I didn'tcome-" the sergeant began,
but the word stuck in his throat.
"I had' flattered myself," resumed Judith,
id the same deprecating tone, " that the
daughter of your friend, Sergeant Giles, would
find a place in every patriotic heart."
"By Heavens, Miss Judith, you have two
places in mine !" cried Giles. "If you wanted
it fo'r a pin-cushion, I don't know but I should
take it out and give it to fou. But I've got a
stern mistress, whose name is Duty, young
lady ; and, as a soger-lad, I must stick to her
through thick and thin. Duty, miss, says I
must search that bed you're layin' on ; and
on my knees, as 'twere, I beg of you to
rise."
" He's going' to steal the dientical bed she's
layin' on, and lie's going' to drife her up at the
p'int of his sword in her night-gown !" said
Meg, rocking her body to and fro, in much
apparent distress.
"I should suppose that my friendless situ.
ation," resumed Judith, determined to make as
much delay as possible, " would soften the
heart of Cornwallis himself, were he present, to
1 witness my distress."
Giles turned to the chaplipin for assistance,
for Tarleton's dragoons would not have been
so formidable as Judith's eyes.
" The duty is not a pleasant one," said
Humphrey, coming in a prompt and resolute
manner to the rescue, "but we know what is
expected Qf us. Miss Redmond is quitephwar
that we would shed our blood in her defence;
and her plausible words seem to me but an
idle pretext to gain time, for some object best
known to herself.".-
"Whatever may be your virtues, reverend
sir, charity does not appear to be one of them
] am in your power, and you can enforce youi
commands. I really feel- too weak to arise
' r me your hand, Meg ; these gentlemen
.  be obeyed. There must needs bet

85

British spy concealed in the bolster or in the
straw-mattress."
" Beauty is duty, Miss Judith," said Giles,
and the moment Miss Redmond's feet touched
the floor, stalked sturdily to the bed, and com-
menced a slashing assault upon it with his
sword.
" What bravery ! what courage!" laughed
Mrs. Hadley.-     .
The sergeant having probed the bed to his
satisfaction, turned from it with obvious dis-
appointment.
" I thought it meant something," he mut-
tered. " Her manner justified suspicion."
" I hope you are satisfied ?" otLserved Ju-
dith.
" We are convinced that the man we seek
is not here. I trust you will bear witness,
Miss Redmond, that we have discharged our
duty," said the chaplain, bowing, and retiring
into the next room.
" One more look into the cellar," added
Giles, " and I shall be satisfied."
" What !" screamed Mrs. Hadley. "Must
there be more botheration ? Iavmn' give ye
leave to s'arch my house like an honest wo-
man, can't, you go away decently, or must ye
hang round till morning , keeping' them awake
as sorely needs sleep, and burnin' out my
candles as if a lone widder hadn't nothin' else
to do but make 'em."
Humphrey, having the unpleasant recollee-
tion of Jaffer in his mind, added his voice to
the woman's, in an attempt to dissuade Giles
from his purpose. But he was a man not to
be turned aside when once resolved.' Deb, af-
ter some argumentation, reluctantly sprang
the trap.
"Down," said she, "if down you must;
but my word for't, it'll bring ye to grief."
" Give me the candle, hag ! Come on, par-
son."
" Nay," replied Humphrey, " I enre not for
a second look ; and you're such a brave lad
you'll do well enough without me."
," It'll be a fine story to carry back to our
dragoons that an able-bodied parson is afeard
of a dead darkey ! What's a man good for
that's scared' at the sight of a corpse ."
" Say no more, scoffer, for I am with you.
It's little that I care for men, living or dead,
armed as I am with the sword of the flesh and
the sword of the spirit "
The parson swung .is muscular body into
the cellar, and groped about after Giles, who
t poked in every corner with his sword, and
overturned everything that could by any pos-
I sible chance conceal a human figure.
"How is it ?" queried Humphrey, sarcasti-
r call. " Is that little insect still in your ear ?"
The sergeant looked over his shoulder to
n give Humphrey a sharp reply, and, coming
a unwittingly upon the body of Jaffer, tumbled

/

over it. The light was extinguished by his
fall, and he found himself upon the could lump
of mortality, in the midst of a darkness that
was most intense.
" By Heavens! he breathes - his heart
beat s -he is warm!" cried Giles. There was
a slence of a moment, in which the sergeant's
hands and senses. were busy ; then there was
a sudden outcry.
"Here he is! here he is! help, help !"
Immediately there followed a struggle, and
the trap-door was instantly closed. The chap-
lain stcood paralyzed with superstitious awe.
It appeared to him tlhat that .black horror,
Jaffcr, had revived and grappled with his
friend.
"Verily, we are best by the powers of
darkness !' he exclaimed. "Bring a - light,
woman, bring a light !"
Humphrey might as well have been in the
centre of the earth for all the eff et his words
produced. He heard the crack and strain of
. in.b opposed to limb and muscle to muscle,
as Giles and his unseen adversary roll d upon
the ground and tugged at each other in vari-
ous positions.
" Contendest thou with man or devil ?" de-
manded the chaplain, in an excit ed voice.
Before he received a reply, the invisible com-
batants had struggled to their feet and fallen
again heavily.
" For God's sake, Humphrey, help me !"
answered Giks, speaking with extreme diffi-
culty.
" A candle, woman, a candle !" roared the
chaplain.
"1Short'll be the bit o' candle that ye'11 git
from me, and long'll be the time ye'll wait for
it!" screamed Deb from above.
" Accursed witch of Endor !" exclaimed
Humphrey. "As I live she has fastened the
door upon us!"
" Ay, that I have ! and it won't open ag'in
till ye-re fine enough for the wind to blow ye
away."
"What means the sorceress ?" said the be-
wildered chaplain, feeling about in the inky
blackness.
Giles and his antagonist rolled to his feet.
" Avaunt ! man or dcvil, now I have thee !"
and casting himself desperately upon the
twain, seized one by the throat.
" Help ! help !" gasped Giles in a choking
voice.
"Be of good cheer, sergeant, for I am help-
ing thee mightily. I have Apollyon by the
throat, and if he have not an extraordinary
tenacity of life, I will soon finish him."
While the parson was speaking, he who
was uppermost disengaged himself and slip-
ped away, while the throttled man writhed and
twisted beneath the iron fingers that clutched
him.

"Fool!" said a voice from out the dark-
ness. " Wouldst thou strangle thy friend ?"
"Good God!" cried Humphrey.     " What
am I doing ?"
He rehnquished his hold
" By the Lord !" muttered Giles, the breath
rattling in his throat. "I'll have you hanged
in sight of the whole regiment! A moment
longer and my business would have been done.
What in the devil's name possesses ye ?"
" Friend Giles, it was a device of Satan, by
which I was to be made guilty of thy death."
" Device of Satan or not, if I could see, I
would plant as good a blow between thy two
eyes as ever felled an ox !" answered the mndig-
nant Giles.
"It was but a mistake. The best of us do
not always hit the nail on the head, nor is our
zeal at all times according to knowledge,"
replied Humphrey, apologetically.
"Parson, unwittingly youhive done me an
ill turn, which at present I can't forgive ;.but
what voice was it that relaxed your grasp at
my throat ?"
" I know not, if it were not thy late adver-
sary, which seemeth to me unreasonable."
" My late adversary," answered Giles, "was
no doubt him of whom we are in search, and
for the good turn he has done me he shall
hang the easier. I will cover the rope with
silk that it shall not chafe his neck."
"For which he will thank thee, no doubt,"
responded Humphrey, drvly. "Well, we have
him ; the next thing is to get out with him."
"Hillo, old woman ! let up-let up !" shout-
ed the sergeant.
" Do ye surrender yourselves prisoners of
war ?" queried Captain Deb, in a shrill voice.
" Devil a bit on't! so open, quick, or I'll
raise the very old Nick with your shanty.
You've tricked me once, but you can't do it
twice. I've got your tory spy fast and tight,
and advise ye, as a reasonable critter, to open
that trap to let us go out with our prisoner. In
case of your refusal, I'll cut the spy into inch
pieces, as true as I'm a sergeant in the Conti-
nental Army."
" As for the Tad, Guy Deerin, he can take
keer of himself  in a place so black that jou
can't see a hand afore ye. The lad wasn't
made for liangin', and hung he eha'n't be. He
shall burn first ! Ay ! I'11 burn ye all in a
heap, if ye don't stan' back and 'low him free
and unobstructed passage from the cellar. and
ten minutes slart after he leaves the cabin.
What say ye to that, ye hounds o' the Conti-
nental Congress ?" retorted Deb.
" You crow loud for an old hen," returned
Giles, " but it will go bard with us if we a'n't
up there of our own exertions in less tham a
minute."
" Try it, my dears, try it !" answered the
determined Hadley.

OfWoman,"' argued Giles, who saw the ne-
cessity of rendering her pliable, " you're a
reg'lar trump ; and I never thought the worse
of ye for havin' pluck. To be sure, I've ban-
died words with ye and had my jest ; but
that's human natur', and I'm sure, at heart, I
never meant ye any evil."
The sergeant's voice was quite penitent and
subdued.
" The devil was sick; the devil-a monk wouldbe ;
The devil was well, the devil a monk was he !"
replied Mrs. Deb Hadley, totally unmovedby
Giles' rhetoric.
" You are too hard on a body," rejoined
the sergeant, with affected humility. " You
are too sensible a woman to take'the rough
waysof a soldier in earnest. Come, now ; let's
up, that's a good old soul! Miss Redmond
wants to sleep, and we're content to go away
with our prisoner, besides givin' you a guinea
for your trouble."
"IA cunnin' knave has a cunnin' trick,"
quoth Mrs. Hadley.' " You'like proverbs, and
it were a burnin' shame if you didn't have
enough of 'em when you're stannin' as 'twere,
on the edge of etarnity. You've got a parson
with ye, niy dear, and you won't go out the
world 'thout the benefit o' clergy. So clap
down and at your prayers, for I'm gettin' the
kindlin's ready: and the whole consarn'11
soon be in a light blaze." '
A notable tumult immediately followed
above ; everything seemed relapsing into
chaos. The chaplain was holding hia wound-
ed arm and moaning with pain ; the blackness
of darkness was around them. Fear began to
creep into the stout heart of the sergeant.
" In the name of God !" he shouted, " what
are you doin' ?"
"rPiin' the table, and chairs, and benches,
and feather-bed, and straw-bed in a heap over
the trap, so's to make a jolly fire when it
starts," was the cool rejoinder.
",Heaven and earth !" groaned Humphrey.
"I believe the hag means it. We shall be
smothered here like rabbits in a hole. Truly,
burning is a death crucifying to the flesh.
We had better come to terms at once."
"GTom Thorntonf! Tom ThorntonI" shouted
Giles, at the top of his voice.-
" Little good will it do ye to call Tom
Thornton ; he's been snorin' for the last ten
minutes, and the door is bolted ag'in him, be
sides. - Make up your minds quick, for I'm
jest goin' to clap a coal into the straw-bed!1"
retorted Deb, rattling the fire-shovel and pok-
ing at the fire with the tongs.
" If we allow the spy to pass out unmolest-
ed, what assurance have we that you'll keep
faith with us ? Two to one, you'll shut the
door in our faces and keep us here till your
son comes, with his knaves at his back," in-

87

terrogated Giles, perceiving that the advan-
tage was wholly with the woman.
",Do as you like and nothin' on compuj'on.
Trust me, or fare worse. My son Ch   ian
will soon be here, and a fine bonfire he'll see
if he comes not with haste."
"Hark'ee, Mother Deb! Let Miss Judith
vouch for your good faith, and the rogue
shall go in peace ; but for God's sake don't
keep us here till the poor chaplain bleeds to
death."
"I will-I do vouch for her 1" answered
Judith, earnestly. "I feel assured that what-
ever treaty you make with Mrs. Hadley, will
be strictly carried out ; I pledge my word
that it shall be."
" That's the voice that I like to hear ! The
matter's settled. Cap'n Deb, I surender !
Guy Deerin', you sly, invisible fiend, luck
has stood your friend once more. You've
heerd what's been said, and how we're car-
cumvented. Mother Deb hovers ye as if you's
one of her own chickens. I'm sorry, mister,
you've got into such a brood, and if you ain't
hanged for't, it'll be no fault of mine."
Deering had arisen, and was standing near
the trap.
"There are few things that we see with the
same eyes," he answered, in a suppressed
voice. "You and I, Sergeant Giles, do not,
and may never understand each other.'
" I don't know as I greatly care to have a
better understanding. One thing, however, I
should like to know, and that is, why you
didn't let this blunderin' parson strangle me ?"
said the sergeant.
" My motives I have little time and less in-
clination to explain. When we meet again-"
" May it be at the foot qf the gallows 1" in-
terrupted Giles.
" You are, indeed, an unforgiving enemy,"
added Deering, sadly.
" Love of country is in my blood," quoth
Giles. " I hate everything that is treacher-
ous and underhanded, as 'twere. I've done
my best to take ye, and I think you won't ob-
ject as a triflin' favor to say as much, should
you chance to fall in with Rainford, which is
very probable."
vI can testify," responded the spy, "that
y e'have hunted me like hounds. Ay ! it ha%-
been the same thing over and over for months
*-flight and pursuit, pursuit and flight. I
*shall die one day, I doubt not, ignominiously ;
scoffed at by neighbors and kinsmen, despised
by those whose principles I respect."   -
" Then I eihort thee to turn 'away from fol-
- lowing after strange gods," said Humphrey,
with emphasis." As Paul says-"
" tAs I've often told ye, parson, it's what
Rainford says that does the business," retort-
- ed Giles, abruptly.

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTE

The trap-door sprang open with a creaking,
dissonant sound.
"Farewell," said Deering. " Iforgive you
as much as man may for the strait to which
I have this night been reduced. To the an-
gel who saved me from your misguided wrath,"
he added, as he sprang from the vault and
stood beside Judith, "I shall ever, 'ever be
,grateful."
" Speak not of it, but fly. I have listened
to the pleadings of mercy, for the pains and
penalties of thy trade shock me, and may not
be lightly borne by weak human nature. De-
part, Guy Deering, if the way be clear, and
let us mutually -pray that we may meet no
.more in this mutable world."
The accents of Judith were low and touch-
.ing.
The spy stood before her with an expression
'of indescribable melancholy.
"Such a prayer, beautiful Judith, I cannot
'offer. Thou hast been the one solitary ray of
happiness that has shone, through the dark
-cloud of my life."                  ,
"Marry, come up!" exclaimed Deb. "You're
makin' love to my son Christian's wife! But
that's not the game for you, lad. Come! it's
time you was movin'. I'll open the door soft,
so's not to disturb Thornton, and then, my
fine royal British boy, ti'ust to your legs."
" The wife of Christian Hadley !" murmured
Deering,.with less surprise than Judith ex-
pected to see him exhibit. "What mockery
is this ?".
" Stay not, I entreat!" cried Judith. "You
have heard the truth, terrible as 'it is. The
-door is open. Hush! sp itk not1"
"Come, my gallant boy!" whispered Deb.

chance. But the day of sich unnat'rals is
short, whiph is some comfort. Darter-in-law,
you're a brave girl; and it's a thousand pities
that you don't love my son Christian, with
his right royal red, and his commission in his
pocket."          ,
" Speak not of him-. Have I not enough
to think of-the destruction of my home, the
dispersion of my friends, and the doubt that
involves the fate of Miriam? Woman, the
north and the south are not farther distant
than your son and myself."
"I know that we aren't all made up alike,

p'ison for another. But it's a matter o' time,
gal; all a matter o' time ! A great doctor is
Time ; he brings round his patients arter
awhile, curin''em with doses of days, months,
and years. I've seen them as wanted to die,
reconciled to their fate, and made to rejoice
in it."
"I hear somethin'," said Meg.
" There's allers noises hereabouts. The
dead and splintered branches creak on the
trees ; the leaves go scurrin' afore the wind,
and rabbits and squirrels scamper across the
woodland paths," answered Deb.
"It's none o' them yer, but the rumblin' of
a wagon," replied Meg.
"Meg is right, I think," said Judith. "I
certainly hear the rattle of whee!s."
" I hear it; your young ears are sharper'n
mine. It seems as if we should have no rest
this blessed night ; fast as one goes, another
comes. Listen a minute !"
All were silent.
"Whoa, Crazy ! A'n't agoin' to r-un your
head ag'in a cabin door, be ye ? Hold up,
ne'tur !"
"It's the Swordmaker of the Santee !" said
Deb, joyfully. '- He's a simple-minded, harm-
'less old boy, and '11 do nobody any mischief.
He has often passed here with his horse and
-cart. He's pooty old, and has a monstrous
-hump on his back ; but is no fool for all that.
We've had many a good talk together about
the times, the king, the war, and the liberty."
Judith's heart beat fast with expectation.
She felt a secret assurance of assistance.

" Yes, I've come to your aid. I seed your

"A curse on that sleepy dog ! he didn't

blaze!  When the sun rises, Deb Hadley
won't have a place to lay her head."
The woman looked defiantly up at the roof,
down which puffs of smoke now began to
drive.
"Let it burn, Goody Hadley. There's
timber in the forest to make another, and
willin' hands among the Royal 'Mericans to
build if. Cheer up, old mother ! don't never
complain till you have the neuralagy and the
rheumaticss, and are as hard o' he.arin' as a
whale at the bottom o' the ocean," answered
Hirl, rubbing his hands, encouragingly, and
obviously mustering a great deal of philoso-
phy for the benefit of Captain Deb.
"It's easy enough to make comfort for
'others, old man, when you're goin' on smooth
yourself! But I'll have it out of 'em for this.
My son Christian shall cut 'em up, and hang
'em up, too. What a world 'tis, when men
forgit their 'leigance to the king, and go run-

The injured woman seemed on the point of
appealing to Heaven for help -against rebels
and 'wrongs.

jump right in, and away we'll trundle. Crazy's
a great creetur to go ! I'll take ye to a place
where a dog won't dare to move his tongue,"
replied the swordmaker, gently leading Ju-
dith from the cabin.
" That's right, grandaddy ! Be keerful o'
my son Christian's wife," said Mrs. Hadley,
approvingly.
" No, I can't hear no fife. Can't hear a
bugle 'less -it's pootty near. One o' my ears,
you see, is tore all to bits. IHeerd the groans
o' the wounded, though, when Tarleton tackled
Somerton's drag'ons. Bless me! how the reb-
els fit !  That devil,-Rainford, made a great
swarth right through the kurnil's calvary.
There was two royalists to one rebel ; but
I'll die if I didn't think, one spell, that the
rebels would git the best on't."
" No more o' that, if you want me to ride
in your cartI" cried Mother Hadley.' "Woe
is meI what a sad sight to see it burn.
What'll Christian do for the housekeepin' and
the wife? D'ye think I can leave it, man,
without grief ? And where will ye go ? What
spot of airth is there where D b Hacley can
find another home ready at, hand ?"
" Trust your brave son for that, and hop
into the cart. Miss Judith can set on the seat
with the old man, and you and the caller
creetur can stow yourselves 'mong the lug-
gage ; there's plenty o' room-plenty on t.
Come,:Goody, bear a hand! Don't be nus-
sin' your troubles; they'll grow fast .enongh
without care."
Deborah Hadley, with much complaining
and muttering, finally mounted the cart, and
rode away with her face 'turned sorrowfuly
to her burning cabin.
" You'll know how good it is, now, to be
burned out," said Hirl. " Many, beside your-
self, have been' made houselcss this night.
Squire Redmond's house, and stables, and
negro huts have turned to ashes since sun-
set."
"Tell me, good swordmaker," said Judith,
with trembling eagerness, "if you were near
during that terrible scene ; and can you give
me any information respecting my sister Mir-
iam ?"
"Thank God, I can !" answered the sword-
maker, with 'a fervor that made Deborah
Hadley start. "She was rescued from the
flames ; she is safe."
" Heaven bless you, old man, for this as-
surance I You relieve me of an op presive and
terrible anxiety. And Colonel Someton ?"
" He was saved, too. How young gals take
to handsome uniforms! Now, if it had been
an old man like me, no one would took the
trouble to ask about me. But that's natur', I
s'pose."
" Judge not so uncharitable, worthy sword-
maker," replied Judith. "Kindness is seldom.

THE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE;'OR, HIRL THE HUNCHBACK.

forgotten, and I trust my memory is good.
But where are you driving us ?"
To a place where you'll be safe enough,
I'll warrant."
The swordmaker touched his mare with his
whip, and she started- at a pace which soon
took them to the end of their journey, which
was an unfihfished and deserted house on the
marin of the forest.
It was built by a rebel," said Hirl, "who
left it half done to go a sogerin', and it's ten to
one if he ever comes back."
The first beams of morning were glittering
in the east, when Judith followed the sword-
maker into the dwelling. The first object that
met her view was Miriam. Goody Grindle,
who as usual was performing the office of
nurse, had fallen asleep upon' her post ; she
was brought reluctantly from her dreams by
the hurried footsteps of Judith, as she sprang
tot embrace her sister. Glancing about the
room, Judith saw Somerton approaching from
an obscure corner. There was a flush upon his
face, and unusual vivacity iin his expression.
The young lady extended her hand, saying :
"Surely, colonel, you have been the subject
of magical arts, else I should, see you en a
couch of pain."         -r
" I think I may affirm ,safely that I have
been under the influence of necromancy since
I rode in the swordmaker's cart to the present
moment."
He looked at Miriam expressively, who
averted her eyes..
"Not to your'harm, Ihope," replied Judith,
smilingly.
"To my everlasting good, I firmly be-
lieve !" he answered,,with a fervor that was
quite enigmatical to Judith.
"Don't look so puzzled-like, child 1" cried
Goody Grindle, who -was by this time wide
awake. " There's been queer doin's this night.
Bless us, Miriam! you needn't wink and blink
at me to keep me from talkin', for it's my
nature to be continually runnin' on. The truth
is, Judy-and the truth must come out when
I have anything to do with it-the colonel's
been and made love to Miriam, thinkin' it was
you;. and I'll perish if I don't think she's ac-
cepted him, burns, petticoat, and all, jest as he
stands."
At this juncture, Deborah Hadley, who had
stood in the back-ground, advanced,-and con-
fronted Somerton.
"Dear goodness ! here's a pair on us, I
should say. War sort of mixes up things
don't it ?" she said, with a.comical leer thai
was quite irresistible.
Somerton glanced at his novel toilet, for he
still wore the petticoat that Betsey Grindle, in
her superabundant kindness, had invested him
with, and joined heartily in the laugh that wa
raised at his expense.

" You're an odd figger to make love," added
Deborah ; " and it's the luckiest thing in the
world that' yqu, didn't set your heart on my
son Christian's wife."
"Wife ?" repeated Somerton, vaguely.
"Nothin' less nor more," answered Deb,
stiffly, then turning to Judith, added: "Ihave
pleasure in introducin' to you and everybody,
my darter-in-law, Mrs.'Judith, Hadley, wife of
Christian Hadley, captain of the Royal Amer-
icans, with his commission in his pocket,
signed by the 'king himself."
" What's the lunatic talkin' about ?" queried
Betsey Grindle, her pride beginning to mount
to her face. " This is my niece, and the wife
of nobody, much less of that infamous tory,
Christian Hadley, the mention of whose name
makes her pale as a lily."
" Ask the gal!" retorted Deborah, defiantly.
" She won't deny that she was brought to my
house, that a parson was sent for and came,
and the ceremony was performed."
"What means this, Judith ?" cried Miriam.
"Speak, Meg !"
" They've jes' done gone married her, whe-
ther she would or no. I heerd the whole cere-
mony ; but goodness, Miss Merry ! she was in
a dead faint, an4 I-don't believe sensed a dozen
words of it. I sot there a holdin' on to her,
and I prayed ; and I prayed ; and I prayed
that dem, yer wheels-o' time would roll 'em all
into eternity together."
"Know you anything of this ?" asked Som-
erton, looking at the swordmaker.
"I know what- they say, kurnil, and if the
marriage is binded, DebHadley has got a nice
darter-in-law."
Judith was by this time nearly insensible,
and Miriam and her aunt were hanging over
her in great alarm and bewilderment.
"These wrongs must cease," said Somerton,
with energy.
" And they will !" muttered the sword-
maker,
" Long live the king !" exclaimed Deborah
Hadley.
" Who'll take that masculine woman by the
shoulders' and put her out doors ?" demanded
Betsey Grindle, appealing to no one in par-
ticular.
" Yes, who'll do it ?" repeated Captain Deb.
" What'sthat ?" cried Meg, suddenly.
-   There was a pause. The distal t blast of a
bugle was heard ; the mellow notes drifted
into the open doors and windows like soft bil-
, lows of harmony.
t "I should know those sounds," said Som-
erton.
e "'Tis the blare of a trumpet ! said Mrs. Had-
n ley, quickly. "A guinea to a shillin' that the
i royal Americans are coming , with my son
s Christian at their head. What think ye, old
Hirl?"

" I can't hear much, but jedgin' by wha
little I can hear, I should say a company o
hoss was coming' this way at a clean gallop,
answered the hunchback, qietly. -
"Be they friend or foe ?" interrogated Deb
"I should think they might be one o
tetherr !" screamed the swordmaker. "In the
course o' natur' they must be for or ag'inst.'
".Any fool knows that !" replied Mrs. Had-
-   Icy, complimentarily.
The bugle-notes grew louder and louder, and
the heavy tramp of horsemen drew nearer
Manifestly every person in the dwelling await
ed the results with anxiety. The matter was
. soon settled ; Rainford dashed up to the door
at the head of his dragoons. Seeing Somer-
ton at the window, he threw himself from the
saddle, and hurried to greet him.
" My dear colonel," he said, "I scarcely ex-
pected this pleasure, although I have been in-
formed of your escape from Hadley, and his
ruffians, and of your being conveyed to Red-
mond's plantation. I knew the house was
burned, and feared the worst."
" Providence has kept me alive, gallant
Rainford, and I hope to ride again to battle
by your side. How is it? Are our poor fel-
lows cut to pieces? Have the dragoons lost
heart and courage ?"
"They have been roughly used, and are
terribly harried with fighting overpowering
numbers. But -the stout lads are good for
another day. A few hours' rest and a hearty
meal, will put most of them right ; but' some
of them are done with eating. Well, that's a
soldier's fate, Somerton. Whom hve you
here? Ahi! I see bright eyes, and others that
are not so bright. What is that masculine
creature in the black coat and red petticoat?
She looks like the devil's dam."
"And such she is ; she is the mother of
Christian Hadley," replied the colonel.
" Infamy enough for one woman. I see a
face that I know-that sharp'female, Betsey
Grindle. But who are those pretty creatures
who look as much alike as two peas in the
same pod ?" '
" The Redmond sisters," answered Somer-
ton, glancing at the twain with evident pride.
" The Redmond sisters," repeated Rainford,
- , musingly. " My gallant colonel, I shall watch
you ! With such fair nurses, I fear your'
wounds will not heal by the first intention, as
surgeons say. Well, Love and Glory are yoke-
fellows."
"'A rough soldier has little time for senti-
ment at such a crisis as this," replied Somer-
ton, coloring.
" Time ? you've taken it by the forelock, ere
this ; if you haven't, you've neglected your
. opportunity ; that's all I can say. Here's the'
swordmaker, too. A queer old body is the
swordmaker I By-the-way, I have rare news

Dj

t for you: Marion's brigade is thundering up
f from the swamps of the Santee. We'll drive
Tarleton into the river, and send him back with
banners trailed in the dust. This is not all ;
as I came up I saw a man running across a
r field. I put spurs to my horse, leaped fences,
e ditches, and gates, ana finally'captured him.
" Whom do you think it was? It was our old
- friend, the spy."
",The'spy !" said the colonel, with a start.
" The spy !" repeated Hirl, in a voice more
indicative of consternation than surprise.
"The spy.!" gasped Judith.
s " The same," replied Rainford. " And you
r may rest assured," he added; significantly,
"that he'll never be caught again."
" Have you murdered him ?" asked the
swordmaker, huskily.
- " A continental soldier, old man, never com-
mits murder," retorted Rainford, haughtily.
" Tell me, oh tell me, sir-have you-have
you-" began Judith, with strange vehe-
mence.
" Lady," answered Rainford, "be lives.
Giles-sergeant Giles, bring forward the pris-
oner."
The word was passed along ; and after some
commotion among the dragoons, Giles and
Thornton appeared, leading the unfortunate
Deering, whose arms were pinioned tightly.
His face was calm, pale, and melancholy. He
did not notice Judith, but a shudder passed
over his person when he saw the swordmaker.
For an instant he was affected, but presently
confronted Raiaford and Somerton with self-
possession.
" Rash, misguided man !" exclaimed Somer-
ton, sorrowfully. "I had hoped that we should
never meet again, and that the past had
taught you wisdom. You have tempted Prov-
idence one- time too many ; nothing can save
you."
" Of what am I accused?" demanded the
man, with an unflinching eye.
Judith looked anxiously from one to the
other of the two men.
"Every child on the Santee could tell you
your crime. The name of Guy Deering is too
well known," returned the colonel.
" My name is Henderson-Max Henderson."
" The same subterfuge and falsehood!"
cried Rainford, contemptuously.
" It is my duty to assure you that this will
not avail you," added Somerton, with firmness.
"I have not the slightest hope that it will,"
re lied the spy.
The swordmaker stood watching the latter,
and Judith ; his countenance. expressive of the
deepest interests
" Ah my boy, my poor boy, why didn't you
keep out o' their elutches arter you left the.
cabin ?" exclaimed Deborah Hadley, with evi-
dent sorrow.

THIE SWORDMAKER OF THE SANTEE;

"Do you hear that, your honor? She ac-
knowledges that he was at her cabin, to which
I can swear ; for I saw him there, and should
have taken him, if the chaplain and I hadn't
been carcumvented by that she tory. I can
testify, too, that she called him Guy Deerin'
more nor once. Lord, Colonel! we can swear
his life away in no time," interposed Giles,
with much zeal.
" Woni-in," said the spy, looking steadily at
mother Hadley ; " I have entered no cabin of
yours in the lat twelve hours. I have been
too busy to avail myself of the shelter of a
roof."
"Cool enough ! cool enough!!" said the ser-
geant, with an incredulous shrug. "Don't
know nothin' 'bout bemn' hid in the cellar, I
s'poise, nor what happened there, norhow you
got away at last ?"
"I protest, gentlemen, that I am utterly
ignorant Qf all this," answered the accused,
impressively.
" He knows no more about it than a child
unborn ! As for being' at my cabin, that was
mor n a week ago," asserted Deb, promptly.
"This lad isn't no more like Guy Deerin' than
a cheese is like the moon. His name is Hen-
derson, and nothin' else. Dear me ! I know d
the Ilendersons years ago, man and boy, wo-
man and child."
1Good mother," said the spy, calmly, "let
us have nothing but the truth, for I am placed
where the truth will serve me, as well as false-
hood; and neither can avail me aught."
-And it's the truth I've been tellin', which
I'mallers ready to tell for friend or foe. Who
can have the heart to bring sich a fine-lookin'
man to the halter?  But men become despe-
rately wicked when they forgit the king and
run art'-r liberty, Mr. Washin'ton, Congress,
and others."  -
Deborah shook her head regretfully, and.
sighed.
The swordmaker advanced a step toward the
accused, who said, quickly, in a deprecating
voice:
"Nay, old m'an, I conjure you not to speak !
The few feeble words that you could say in
my favor will not affect the fate that is reserved
for me, in the smallest degree. Your testi-
monymightinvolve another. For God's sake,
be quiet!"
Rainford and Somerton exchanged a few
words in low tones. The former then gave an
order in the same voice to an officer near him.
Judith cast herself at the swordmaker's feet,
and seizing his hand, cried :
"Oh, sir, ifyou can say any thing in favor
of this wretched man, I entreat you, by all that
you love, to say it!"
"What can I do, child ; what can I do ? I
am neither Somerton, nor Rainford, nor Wash-
ington," answered Hirl, mournfully.

" Do you know this lady, sir ?" asked Som-
erton, pointing to Judith, and fixing his re-
gards steadily upon tlie spy.
" I have reason to believe her to be Judith
Redmond ; but never had the pleasure and
honor of her acquaintance," he replied.
Judith arose, and gave him a reproachful,
sorrowful glance.
" It is Judith," said the swordmaker, in a
voice so changed that every one involuntarily
looked at him.
"I have heard much of her goodness. May
God bless her!"
Judith was bewildered. What did this
mean?   Was it a generous concealment to
save her name and fame ; or was it a justifiable
subterfuge, resorted to to weigh in his favor
by embarrassing the question of his identity."
An officer approached Rainford and said,
" We are ready, sir."
" Ladies," said Somerton, "you had better
retire into the house, and lose the doors.
The further examination of the prisoner will
be conducted more privately."
" Such is not your purpose," said Judith,
with empressement. "You have something
terrible in view."
" Mister," said the swordmaker, addressing
the spy, " what might be the matter with your
hands and arms? It 'pears like as though
you'd passed through a furnace."
Somerton heard the words,. and glanced at
what he had not before observed-the hands
and arms of the prisoner.    His manner
changed in a moment ; he sprang toward
Deering, saying :
'," I conjure you to tell me how you received
those injuries ?"
The man's hands were blistered and char-
red, and his coat and linen hung in scorched'
threads from his arms.
"Question me-not," replied Deering.
"I insist !" continued Somerton, emphati-
cally.
"In rescuing two human beings from a
burning building, I received these wounds
from the angry flames," answered the spy, un-
assumingly.
"I knew it! I knew it!" exclaimed Somer-
ton. "It was you who bore me from Red-
mond's house-it was you who saved Miriam.
I had an unaccountable apprehension of it at
the time, although my bodily faculties were
paralyzed by suffocating gases."
" Captain Rainford, I am ready ! I thank
you that this time it is not hanging," said the
prisoner, with a faint smile.
Sergeant Giles took him by the arm to lead
him away. Some ten rods distant, a dozen
dragoons could be seen in line, under arms.
While Somerton stood deeply affected by this
development, General Marion and two of his
aides arrived at the scene. His coming was

THE KNIGHT OF THE BLACA FLAG.

CHAPTER I.
"He was the mildest mannered man
That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat ;
With suchtrue breeding of a gentleman,
You never could divine his ieal thought."
-BmroN.
" Yes, noble lady, I am dreaming-dream-
ing of the day when I shall wear the spurs of
knighthood, be kind to my inferiors, courteous
to my equals, and acknowledge no superior of
my own sex but my God and the king !"
The spot where these words were spoken
was in a wildly beautiful valley in Wales, a
rocky, wooded dell, which lay beneath the
walls of an ancient castle, wh'se lofty grey
towers and rough battlements gave token of
its power, well garrisoned,-to 'withstand the
siege of an army. And it had withstood more
than one siege ; for its lordly gwnor, the Earl of
Caermarthen, had been true to Charles the
Martyr, scorning Cromwell and his bloody
protectorate, and now gloried in the favor of
the reigning monarch, Charles the Second.
The castle stood high among the craggy
cliffs which border the western coast of
Wales ; so near the sea that the roar of the
. ocean surges could be heard in its halls, when-
ever the spirit of the storm awoke them from
their slumbers. And down from amid those
crags, crossing the winding pathway to the
castle, where a rude bridge spanned it, rushed
the main fountain of the Towy river on its
foamy way to Cardigan Bay.
The speaker was a young -man, not far past
his twentieth year, in the flower of strength
and manly beauty. His fine form was plainly
but neatly clad in a fashion which indicated
his vocation to be a military one. A sword
rested in its scabbard on his thigh, and a dag-
ger was in his belt. A peaked hat with a
broad brim shaded his white forehead, over

which drooped a single ostrich ferither, as black
as night. ,From beneath this hat, his hair de-
scended-in glossy brown curls down upon 'his
shoulders, in true '.'cavalier" style, and the
lower pa   of his"finely-featured blonde face
was co ered with a . soft. and curling - beard,
which had neyer known the desecrating touch
of the razor or scissors; the one a most
barber-ous, aiid'the other, a most .treacherous
and Delilah-ian weapon.
That the young man wore arms, in that time,
was sufficient toprove that he either was of
gentle blood, or else in the service of one of
the nobility.  His manner to the lady, whose
questioning had elicited the words which oc-
cur at the opening of this story, was humble
and deeply respectful ; but yet he permitted
his blue eyes unabashed to gaze upon her
truly glorious beauty ; and though the color
came and went upon his face like the blushes
of a bashful maiden, there was no tremor in
his voice when he replied to her. She had
ridden up to .iim, followed by two attendants
of her own sex, while he stood leaning against
an oak by the side of the rushing stream,
in so deep a reverie that he had not heard her
approach.
I said she was very beautiful. Nor did I
err. Her noble bust was well displayed, as she
sat upon an Arabian courser of snowy white ;
and though a look of cold and haughty pride
somewhat marbleized her perfect features, an
illuminating smile so softened them, when she
spoke to the young man, that to him she look-
ed like an angel.
" Thy aspirations are lofty, Master Henry,"
said she, with a smile at his words.
" Very, lady ! so lofty that few ears will hear
me utter them. Excuse my folly in speaking
of them."
"Nay, I did not say it was folly, Master
Henry," said the lady, quickly, for he seemed
