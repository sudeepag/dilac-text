S-   TOM MTTLLER. I. THE. NEW HOME. "While some can preach the gospel with their lips, others can preach it only with their lives. Dear friend, there are, it may be, many-kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification." TOMMY MLLER was nine years old the day he landed ,in the city of Philadelphia. He had come from Ireland with his, father and mother, two brothers and two sisters. It was a very sultry morning in the month of August, 1833. But the air of the dusty and crowded city even, was a pleasant change from that of the hot and oyer-crowded steerage of the ship. which had brought them over. It was a great relief too, to set their feet on solid 9   10     TOM: jMVTrA TRET; OR, ground once more, after the long, monotonous voy- age. And best of!all, they met among the crowds upon the wharf their two eldest children, a son and a daughter, Vwho had come to America two years before. There were many joyful exclama- tions, and a great deal of hugging and kissing. Scres of questions were asked which did not get answered, and answers given which were not heard. After the first joyful tumult of the meeting was over, they all started together up the street. Each one carried a bundle in the hand, and two boys whom they had hired on the wharf, followed close behind with a hand-cart, containing the large wooden chest which held the remainder of the possessions, they had brought from the old home. The new-arrived looked about them very curiously at the strange city in which they had come to live, while Robert and Ann, in the pride and responsibility of their position as old resi- dents, brought out all their knowledge of its wonders and advantages to astonish and delight' them. Tommy's new shoes were a little too small, or   oAJETSR MA:sNY DAYS.      1 else his feet were not accustomed enough to such restraint to be comfortable in them; for he soon sat down on one of the clean, white marble steps (for which Philadelphia was as famous then as it is now), and took them off. With the shoes in one hand, and the other fast clasped in that of his mother, he went pattering over the pavements, eyes and ears wide open to the sights and sounds around him. Tommy was the youngest of this large family, and a bright, blue-eyed, flax-headed little Irish boy, full 'of life and fun. Now, however, his chubby face wore a very thoughtful and earnest look. It was a serious thing, this leaving old "County Tyrone" and sailing so many days over the great Atlantic Ocean, and landing at last in a new and strange country.  Everything he saw made him feel that it was really a new world, and a very important thing to begin to live in it. He did not wonder at all when Robert and Ann exclaimed, again and again, how much he had grown since they left the old home in Ireland.' He felt a great deal older'and more experienced after such a journey, and did not doubt that he was a larger boy than when he started!   12     TOM: 1XTTTF R,; OR, On they went up the street, Samuel Miller, the father, striding on in advance with his grown-up son at his side, while the three girls Ann, Mary and Katy made up a constantly shift- ing group close behind him. Next came the mother and Tommy, then the two half-grown sons John and Sam, while the boys with the hand-cart brought up the rear. It was a pleasant sight; for their healthy, happy, eager faces were full of hope and courage for the new life and its burdens. The father was a stalwart, rugged man, with trong resolution and iron will stamped upon a face which, under the influences of the occasion, had relaxed into more of geniality and kindness than it usually showed. The mother, Jane Miller, was a neat, trim- t looking little woman, slender in person, and with a pale and thoughtful face. There were traces of tears upon her cheeks, yet she had a warm smile for her little boy whenever he looked up to her with question or comment. A gentleman and lady met the little party as they were crossing Eighth street. "What a respectable-looking emigrant family,"   AFmTxER MANIY DAYS.      13 the former said, looking back at them. "Did you notice the mother? She wears quite an unusual expression for a woman in her station and circumstances."  "Yes, I observed it," the lady replied. cHer face reveals much of her character, I believe. Faith, patience and tenderness all speak from it, and make it beautiful in spite of her forty years, I should judge, of hard labor and care." "She must be a Christian," added her hus- band. "Nothing but a life near to Christ, and a heart at rest on God's word, gives such sweet serenity and trust as you see in that countenance." He was right. These Irish children, though rough in look and manner had yet been blest with one of God's best gifts, if not His very best next to that of His own dear Son,-a faithful, Christian mother. ax We're getting 'most there now, mother," Ann called out as they reached the next crossing. She and Robert had hired a house for the family before their arrival, and her mistress had given her a holiday that she might take them at once to their future home. Just then Tommy caught sight of something 2   "     TOM MLLER; OR, which greatly astonished him. It was evidently a man, but such a man as he had never seen nor heard of before. His face, neck and hands were black; his head was covered with short, woolly hair; his eyes were bright and curiously shining; and his teeth very large and white. Tommy was not a cowardly boy, but this was an unexpected, and, to him, unaccountable sight. He could not help trembling with fear as the strange man ap- proached, anpl when he attempted to cross to the side where Tommy was walking, it was quite top frightful to be borne any longer. Letting go his mother's hand, he ran screaming across the street. Robert ran after him and with much difficulty quieted his fears and brought him back. Tommy never forgot his first view of a 'colored man, and his brothers and sisters remembered it a great deal too long for his pleasure and peace. The little party soon came to the house, and as Robert and Ann had bought what articles of fur- niture they thought would be needed, they all egan to be very busy in unpacking their bundles and chest, and in arranging the house. Humble as the place was, it soon began to assume a com- fortable, home-like air, and when they sat down   AFTTER] MANY DAYS.      15 to dinner around the pine table you could have read satisfaction and contentment on all their faces. But in one there was also mingled humble gratitude to God, as the Christian wife and mother, amid all the din and chatter of voices, sat for a few moments in silent prayer and thanks- giving, before she tasted food in her new home. Samuel Miller was a weaver, and it was not long before he found work and bought and started his loom. In fact, very soon all the fam- ily had some employment; they did not expect to get rich in the new world without labor. Ann found places at service for her sisters Mary and Katy, and John and Saipuel hiied out to work. about the coal-yards and wharves. Even little Tommy was not idle, for before he left Ireland he had been taught to wind the bobbins, or spools which his father' put into the shuttle to weave into the cloth. Robert, the oldest son, was a car-   penter, and had work at his trade, and the mother had plenty to do to wash, iron, cook and mend for her husband and four sons, besides keeping her little house clean and in order. But for one thing Mrs. Miller would now have been happier than she had been since the time   16     TrOM MTTTsTRT; OR, when they first began to talk of emigrating to America. It had been very hard for her to part with her two oldest children two years before, when the brother and sister determined to seek their fortunes across the wide ocean, and she had- scarcely hoped ever to see them again. Yet now she had found them alive and well, and they were all together again in the land that had seemed so far away. When she thought of all this, her heart was full of thankful prayer. But one thing often made her sad and anxious,-she did not know where to go to church. She had wan- dered out on two or three Sabbath mornings, and gone in with others to the morning service; but no one showed her a seat, or spoke kindly to her, inviting her -to come again, and she did not feel like going a second time to those places. She longed for her seat in the little Protestant chapel at home. Her husband was not a Christian, but he had sometimes gone with her to church in the old country. But now he would not go at all, and spent his Sundays in walking about the city and seeing new things. Poor Jane Miller felt that she must not duly go to church herself, blut get her children under religious instruction and   I: AFTERI MANY DAYS.      17 influences. She felt very badly when  she thought of the effect their present disregard of the Sabbath would have upon them. Yet she did not know what to do. She was utterly at a loss in this great, strange city where to go for religious teaching or counsel. The few women with whom she had become acquainted were Roman Catholics. Thus months passed and still she had no church home. The effect upon Mrs. Miller herself was not so apparent, for she lived too near her Saviour to be affected much by these outward circumstances. But her children, not one of whom had ever yet showed any love for their mother's God, or for the things of His kingdom and service, were fast growing away from her control and influence. They all possessed strong, robust frames, and firmly set purposes, without much tenderness of nature, though they were not willfully unkind. In this they resembled their father, Neither he nor they saw anything attractive in the religion of the wife and mother, although they recognized her goodness and sweetness. They did not see that it was her reliance on Jesus that made her what she was. And now they were going farther 2         13   18     TOM  M:xLIjER; OR, and farther'from her. All their Sunday thoughts and conversation were of the work and plans of the week. The new country and the new life, so well suited to their busy, grasping views, made them daily more and more regardless of the soft, sweet influences of the little timid mother, who could live purely and humbly before Godl who could .pray fervently for her husband and^ chil- 'dren, but whose lips seemed to be sealed if she attempted to talk with them about the things she loved. There are more, such women than we deem, in all the walks of life; too fearful to speak before the bold and worldly, yet strong to do and to pray in silent hope. Sunday was a very busy day with poor Mrs. Miller. There were all the clean clothes to be got out, and the meals to be made ready. The girls came home in the afternoon, and she felt that she must speak a few words of inquiry and advice to them, as she saw them but once a week, though they did not much heed them. They all, however, both boys and girls alike, did appreci- ate the nice, clean room, the bright fire, the well- cooked, abundant dinner, and the warm welcome   AFVTER MANY DAYS.       19 'which the mother felt it a duty to prepare for them on their Sunday visits home.- Some might have thought that this was enough to occupy all the time and thought of one mind and pair of hands on Sunday. And so it was. But oh, how ardently she longed on Sabbath mornings to go to church, and hear holy and soul-stirring ,words to help her through the coming week of toil and care, and comfort her after the discouragements and disappointments of the one just past. How easily, she felt, she eould finish all the work and then prepare herself and her little boy for the Sunday-school, if she only knew where to find one which would receive them. This was thirty years ago, when, although Sunday-schools were to be found in all our cities, and God's people had felt that His blessing was accompanying their efforts, yet there was -no such deep and earnest appreciation of themn as we now see. Mrs. Miller had not only heard of them in the "old country," but, at the little chapel she had attended, one had been begun, At which for a few months before leaving she had placed her younger children. She had realized what an aid it would be in bringing her dear ones to love her precious   20     TOM  VTTrT RZP.; 01, Saviour, and she now earnestly longed to get them again into the Sunday-school fold. Alas! the poor, timid, hesitating stranger knew not where she might go for Christian sympathy and help in this strange land. Meanwhile her children were fast growing up into worldly, rude and noisy men and women, despising to bow to the yoke of Jesus. The mother worked, wept, prayed and hoped, while she seemed daily to be more disregarded by her husband and children, except for the material comforts which came by her effqrts. So it was a bright day for Mrs. Miller, a day iri answer to her most earnest prayers, when a lady and little girl called one Saurday t$'ask for pupils for their Sunday-school. The visitor, whose name was Mrs. Rushton, chanced to be the same who had met the family of the Millers on the day of their arrival, and she recognized the serene, patient face of Mrs. Miller, which had so impressed both herself and her husband on that day. A few words 'about the Saviour's love and care, a few inquiries as to her religious feelings and privileges, and the poor, waiting, burdened heart of the Irish mother overflowed. And in   A3TT1 ER, 1IANY DAYS-.     21 that humble home, with the heavy soundrof the loomiverhead, the wealthy, hap)py Christian lady held sweet converse with her sister in Christ, and learned lessons of long-sufferilg humility and patient frust from her lips. Meanwhile Gertie Rushton, a lovely little girl of about eight years, with soft, blue eyes, and brown curls, rosy-cheeked and bright-lipped, as a healthy, cheerful child should be, crept near to Tommy, who had finished his bobbins for that day, and was very unwillingly sitting on a stood in the corner, with his spelling-book. "Are you not glad you are going to our Sun- day-school to-morrow?" she said. "I don't know;"Tommy said doubtfully, "yes, I guess so. I'd rather go out to walk, as father and the boys do, but mother won't let me." "And why does she let them go, then?"  "Oh, they're bigger than me; big enough to do as father says, and he don't see no hurt in it, I heard him say." Little Gertie had never heard before of fathers and mothers differing on such points, so after a moment's thoughtfulness, she returned to some- thing she did understand. /   22     TOM IVTT TA nR; On, "I'm sure you'll like the Sunday-school," she said, "it's beautiful to hear them sing, and the teachers tell us about Jesus who died to save us. Don't you like to hear about Jesus?" "Mother tells me about Him sometimes," re- plied Tommy, unwilling to seem uninterested in that which seemed so important to here yet unable to say that he did love to hear of Him. " Yes," Gertie added,-" she is telling my mother about Him now. My mother, says Jesus is her best friend, and I guess He is your mother's, too, isn't He?" "Maybe He is," said Tommy, " but I s'pose He a'n't your father's best friend, too, is He? My father don't care much about Him." "Don't he? I'm so sorry. But my papa does. I've heard him tell the children in the Sunday- school ever so many times that He was his Redeemer, and everybody's best friend, if they would only love Him, too." . "Oh!" said Tommy, "I thought it was only women and girls who liked to talk about such things; and the ministers too, of course," he added, after a moment. "Did you? Oh no: there's plenty of men in   3AFT ER MANY DAYS.       23 the church and Sunday-school who talk about Jesus," Gertie said. "I'm sure they love Him as much as the women and children do." The thought crossed Tommy's mind that he wished his father was one of them, if it would make him kind and gentle like his mother; and yet, Tommy had begun already, like the other boys, to think it was manly not to care for reli- gion. This was the manner which Mr. Miller l had adopted since his wife became a Christian;- it was a very good thing for her; in fact, he rather liked her to be pious; but then for a man it was not woi'th while to be so particular about all these little things. It was no wonder that his boys, too, felt in the same way. "You must be sure to come," Gertie said, as she saw her mother preparing to go. "I'll ask papa to let you be in his class. You'll come, won't you?" "Oh, yes, my dear young lady," said Mrs. Miller, "Tommy will come. I wouldn't keep him away a day longer, now I know the place." "You will try to bring your older sons also, and your girls if possible," said Mrs. Rushton, as she rose to go.   24       TOM MLLER. "Thank you, ma'am," Mrs. Miller answered; "that I will if I can. But I am afraid none of them will wish to go except my little Tommy." 'I will get my husband to see your older boys," Mrs. Rushton said, "perhaps he can inter- est them and persuade them to come." And followed by blessings from the full heart of Tommy's mother, and by admiring and curious looks from the eyes of Tommy himself, the lady and her little daughter took their leave. "Now, mother, I can wear my best jacket and hat and shoes that you've kept in the chest so long, can't I?" "Yes, my boy, and ar'ii't you gladnow they've been kept nice and clean for you? I knew the time would come when we would find them that loved the Lord," she said to herself reverently; "I waited for the Lord; my soul waited patiently for the Lord;" she whispered softly, as she has- tened to put on the kettle for their supper. Tommy still stood by the window looking out at the snow-flakes beginning to fall, and wonder- ing if he should like to go to the Sunday-school, for he did not remember much about the one in Ireland, he had seen so manynew things since.   1.          n-II. PEAYiVa!?TRUAWT1. "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not."-Prov. i. 10. TOMMY did not go to school, for his father lsaid he could not be spared from his' work. Mr. Miller never thought it very important that his children should get much education. As soon as they were old enough he wanted them to be earning money. Tommy got some instruction in reading and spelling from his mother, in the evenings, and some from his teacher at Sunday- school; and as he had a good memory and quick understanding, he was getting along tolerably in learning to read. His mother had a good many plans for helping her son to get an education, .blt like most boys of ten years, he was very fond of play, and not very fond of study. He had found out that boys E            3 925   26     TOM MT.4TI-R; OR, in America and boys in Ireland were enough alike to enjoy a game together. Whenever he could get away from his bobbin-wheel for a while he liked to be out in the street, where he was sure to find plenty of play-fellows at any hour of the day. But the street is not the most suitable place in the world to make acquaintances, and Tommy's companions were not always such as his mother, or even his father, would have chosen for him.  At first all the boys had called him "Paddy," and been very rude and overbearing to him. But Tommy was physically, at least, a brave boy, and had so resented their insults and injuries that they soon ceased to ridicule him, and after a while were glad to get him to play with them. None of these boys went to Sunday-school. The Sabbath was their great play-day, spent in rambling about the city, or in games on the vacant lots. These plays were often noisy, and sometimes resulted in open quarrels and fierce fights which brought the police. Mr. Miller, though he had no great re- spect for the Sabbath-day, had yet a strong desire that his family should be "respectable." So he positively forbade his sons to join any of   AIVTE:I M ANY DAYS.      27 the gatherings of boys on that day, fearing that they would be led into some disgrace. Tommy had therefore but few opportunities of meeting his new friends, whose companionship he was sure he would like so well. The first winter of their residence in the city passed away. Tommy had been to Sunday-school very regularly ever since that first day of his go- ing, in December. He was learning to read the Bible now, and his mother felt very glad and- proud of his improvement in this respect. But he was also learning many other things. In the little time he had been able to get from his work on week-days, he had become more and more of a favorite among the boys. They had taught him, all their games with marbles and ball, and he had become quite expert in them. No boy was more popular or welcome on the play-ground than Tommy Miller, for he was good-natured, bright and active. And the more they liked Tommy, the more anxious they were for him to join them on Sunday afternoons, when they had their "best fun," as they said. They hung around the house, and, whenever they could, followed him to the door of the school   28     TOM: IVTTT TR; OR, to persuade him to come with them. At first Mrs. Miller used to go with him and leave him at the door. As soon as she was gone, John Ben- nett, Sam Burton and Jim Walker, the three of Tommy's friends whom the liked best, 'would come as near as they dared and make signals to him. They dared not go very near for fear that some of the teachers would see them and try to get them into school too. But they often succeeded in drawing Tommy's attention, and tempting him very strongly. But so far, he had never ventured to go with them, though they would join him on the way home, and again entice him. I wish I could tell you that the reason of their ill success was that Tommy remembered the words of his Bible, "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not." But this was not the reason, though he had two pretty strong ones. The first was that Tommy loved his mother, and hesitated to do anything to grieve her, and the other was that he feared his father, and dared not disobey him. Mr. Miller was a very stern and even violent man, and often punished his children severely, for their faults. He was very passionate, and when   AFTER3 MA:NY 3DAYS.     29 angry was greatly feared by them all. Tommy had more than once, during this very winter, brought punishment upon himself by staying out too long at noon, when he had a half hour- for play. Sometimes, too, hc would get a good many bobbins wound "ahead," as he called it, and then steal down to his mother with some excuse to dart out at the back door and be off with the boys. He always meant to be back in, time to prevent his father from getting out of bobbins, or missing him. But time passes fast with boys at a good game of play, and Tommy often forgot 1himself. When Mr. Miller missed him he would be very angry and start out to find him. Tommy seeing him coming, would dodge round the nearest cor- ner, get behind his father and run towards home. The wrathfulf man would start in pursuit, and picking up stones by the way, would throw them at his boyxas he ran. Tommy, darting through the little wooden gate at the side of the house would close it upon the angry missiles that some- times rattled against it. But the gate could not protect him from the w;hippings he got inside the house. His dea  r other was always greatly distressed 3-   30     TOM: MLLE   O; 0R when these things occurred, and would afterwards talk and weep and pray with Tommy until he promised not to disobey his father again. Perhaps he remembered her words and prayers and tears longer than he did the blows of his father's rod, though he was sadly forgetful of both, more than once in his life. After a while Mrs. Miller did not think it necessary to go to Sunday-school with her boy, as at first; She hoped that he was beginning to be proof against temptation. But as soon as the boys discovered that be was alone, they began to join him on his way, and talk over their plans for the afternoon. Tommy held out for a long time against all their solicitations, and against the secret inclina- tions of his own heart. But when the spring weather came, and the beautiful sunshine and soft, refreshing air made it so -pleasant out of doors, his resolution began to weaken. Finally, one lovely Sabbath-day in May, he allowed himself to ques- tion in his own mind if he might not stay out just this once, and go to see a famous match of ball which would come off at three o'clock on the grounds beyond Broad street. Sam Burton had   AF-*TEl  M ANY DAiYS.     31 told him all about it the night before as they stood by the wooden gate a little after supper-time. While he was debating the subject, Sam Burton came along, and the question was soon decided. That was not a pleasant afternoon to Tommy. He was afraid that he would not get home by the time Sunday-school was out, or that his father might happen to pass that way and see him. He was very glad when he found himself inside the door at home, at the usual hour, His mother had a head-ache, and was lying down. "You are home just in time, my son ;" she said as she heard him enter, "will you put on the kettle for mother? Did you have a good time at the school to-day?" "Yes, ma'am," said Tommy faintly. He was afraid that the next question would be, "what, was the lesson about?" But his mother was feel- ing too ill to say more, or to notice his guilty, crimson face as he went to do what she asked. Playing truant passed off so well the first time that he was emboldened to try it again. And so very fast do sinful habits grow, that before the summer was over Tommy had formed a plan for   going regularly to school one Sunday, and to play the next. He did not dare to leave the school altogether, for fear his teacher might come -io his mother to inquire the reason. So he gave ex- cuses of various kinds for the Sundays on which he was absent, and Sam Burton helped him to think of answers to give his mother when she asked about the lesson on the days when he went to play. Two or three times, too, he had been fifteen or twenty minutes later in getting home, and was obliged to invent some story to account for his delay, and prevent being found out. Ah!  poor boy! Tommy was not naturally dishonest or un- truthful. But one sin always leads easily into others. In fact, no sin ever comes, or can come, into the heart alone, and this is one reason why sin is such a fearful thing. Wherever it is allowed to come it always brings a troop. If one is con- tinually "striving against sin," however, while it may not entirely leave us, yet it will not be strong and bold enough to bring other sins with it. Tommy Miller had consented to admit the sin of disobedience into his heart, and now  it had brought with it lying, Sabbath-breaking, and   deliberate planning of deception towards his parents. One day early in the autumn there was to be a grand game of cricket out on some open fields near the Schuylkill River. It was not Tommy's Sunday for playing, for the week before he had stayed awaiy from school and gone down on the wharf with thie boys. But the attraction was so strong that lie thought lie would venture to go this day also. His sin had escaped detection so long that he was growing very bold. It was a long way off, farther than he had ever been on Sunday before. He and John Bennett started on a run from the corner of the church just as the bell rang for Sunday-school. Most of the boys had gone earlier, but John waited for him. In fact, John Bennett was now Tommy's favorite among all the boys, and he seemed to think a great, deal of Tommy also. Three months before, conscience would have kept Tommy from enjoying the play, but he had become so accustomed to deceit and disobedience that lie entered heartily into all the sports. A great many boys were there, and tfleir game was very interesting and exciting. He made many C   34     TOM MfL ILElR; 0R, new acquaintances whom  he liked, and- who seemed to like him, and the time passed very swiftly. He did not hear a clock strike at all, and forgot entirely about going home at the usual hour. Suddenly he noticed that the sun was getting very low in the west, and knew that it must be at least two hours later than the tiA for closing Sunday-school. He began to feel frightened and uneasy. He knew that he must have been missed at home long before, and that probably his father and brothers were all out looking for him. - He was afraid to stay there any longer, for they would hear of the game and come there to seek him. He went to the boys from his neighborhood and begged them to go home with him, for besides all his other troubles he did not know the way through the strange streets by which they had come. But the boys were too busy at play to pay much attention to his distress. Bad boys are always ready enough to lead others into sin and difficulties, but are generally too selfish to help them out again.  After waiting in great anxiety and uneasiness until sunset, Tommy was obliged to start for 6   AF' IR inVA--Y DAYS.      35 home alone. And in his confusion and haste he was so bewildered that when he got down as far as Broad and Market lie turned east instead of south, and after walking a long time very fast, he found himself down on the wharves by the Delaware, after damrk. He knew the place now, however, as he, had 'been there before. So he' started again for home, and got in sight of it just as the clocks were striking eight. Tired, hungry and cold as he was, he did not dare to go in. He crouched down by the side of a large box on the corner, nearly opposite, and watched the light in the window. Oh, how un- lhappy and frightened he was! How many times he wished that he had gone to Sunday-school that day! ' The house seemed very still indeed. He won- dered if his father was there, or out hunting for him. If he only could be sure his mother was alone, lie would dare to go in, And then the poor boy burst into tears as lie thought of his dear mother. He remembered how lovingly she had kissed him, as she smoothed' his hair and put on his cap, only a few hours before, little suspect- ing the wicked purpose that was i'm his heart. !   36     TOM M3TILLjER; OIR, The wretched little boy sat there sobbing for a long time. His clothes were thin, and the night was growing cold and chilly. A policeman went by, and he crept as far back into the shadow as he could, lest he should be seen by him. What would not his father do, if his boy should be brought home by anll officer? For Mr. Miller thought it a most terrible disgrace to be seen in the custody of a policeman. It was long after nine o'clock when Tommy saw his mother come to the door and look up and down the street. How pale and sad she seemed! I-e began to think she was probably alone, and that all the rest were out in search of him. So plucking up courage 'he went across the street after she had gone in, and listened at the door. He heard no sound, but a long, deep sighing groan from his mother. So he opened the door and stepped into the room. There sat his father by the stove! He darted at the boy with a fierce and angry oath; but Tommy escaped out of the door, and ran back into the night again. There was a vacant square opposite on which he hid himself among a great pile of hogsheads. He heard his   AFTER MANY DtAYS.       37 father stumbling and swearing and calling, but he lay still and was not found. At last Mr. Miller went in again. It was getting very late. Oh, how long the time seemed to the boy, 'lying there ,on the ground, not knowing what to do! HHe wondered if they would put out the light and all go to bed and Jeave him. By-and-by he heard his mother's voice-that sweet, loving voice he- knew so well-calling, "Tommy! Tommy!" He came out from his chiding-place and went up to her. Oh, how bitterly she cried over her lost boy! And how sorry Tommy felt at that moment for his sin and folly. He was sure that he would never, never again be tempted to do wrong. Mrs. Miller took her boy in at the back door, and hurried him up-stairs to his bed. He under- stood that she had- persuaded his father not to punish him that night. But he could not sleep. His mother brought him a piece of bread, and then left him alone. It was almost morning be- fore he went to sleep, and he awoke at breakfast- time feeling sick and ashamed, but did not dare to remain in bed. 4   38     TOM MLLER; OR, After breakfast, Mr. Miller sternly told Tommy to come with him up-stairs to the room where the loom was. I cannot bear to tell you about the whipping the truant-boy received from his angry father. I would be glad to say that it made him a better boy. But it did not. Perhaps punish- ment given in anger never does do good. Tommy had been sorry for his fault the night before, and ready to promise amendment. But the severe blows and excited words that accom- panied the correction in the morning only made him sullen and bitter. He forgot his sin in his resentment. 'All that day he nursed his rebellious spirit and refused to eat or talk. He did not notice his mother's anxious, loving eyes following himn constantly. He thought Only of his father's taunts and stinging blows. He began to feel that he was much abused, and that his fault was a small one. John Bennett had told him that his mother once tried to make him go to Sunday- school, and when he ran away, his father only laughed and said he "liked the lad's spirit. It was just what he would have done when he was a boy!"So John said his mother soon gave up trying to look after him every Sunday.   AFTER  1 ,IANY DAYS.     39 Tommy said to himself that it was no worse for him to play on Sunday than for his father to  take a walk as he often did, and it was very cruel to punish him for it. So he took counsel of his own wicked heart, and grew more hot and re- bellious. After he had gone to bed that night, his mother came up softly in the dark and knelt beside him. He knew she-was crying bitterly, for he felt her sobs, though he heard no sound. He knew; too, that she was praying for hiim. How many times she had prayed for him before! But although he loved his motherland was sorry for her grief and pain, he did not love the Friend to whom she went in all her trouble. He had never really prayed for forgiveness or help, though he had re- peated his prayers at night and morning. And lately he had even neglected that, for he had grown careless, and ashamed of praying. He had heard the boys make sport of such things, and called those who said prayers "milk-sops" and {"babies." But he could not bear to feel his mother's sor- row now. He put his arms around her neck and kissed her, and began to cry, too.   40     TOM. MLILER; OR, "Oh, Tommy," she whispered, "if you would but be a good hoy and mind father!'" "But mother, father hates me, and whips me so hard!" "He means it for your good, my 'son." "No, mother; I think he only cares for me not to disgrace him. He doesn't love me a bit. He S1n't want me to go to Sunday-school and love Jesus like you do. He only wants me not to play in the street for fear I'll fight and get the police on me.' 9' ' Hush, hush, Tommy! you are not old enough to know:all that your faither wants. But he wants you to mind and do as you are bid. You can do that, and you will, won't you, my darling?" "But mother, what if father should bid me not to go to the school, but stay home and clean the loom on Sunday? He said he would, if I did not let my book alone in work-time." \"I don't think your father will bid you stay from school, Tommy. He only thought so for a little. You must take care not to read your book in work-time." Poor wife and mother.: Who could wonder that her children's hearts were like the wayside,   &i"rJL'Jh J{ANJY DAXYS.   41 anal that thorns sprang up and choked the seed she sowed in tears and agoiny of prayer? She kissed her boy once more, heard him say his evening prayer, and told him again of the Re- deemer who keeps from sin and danger all who trust in him. The story was very familiar to Tommy. But it never sank into his heart. He made many promises of future good conduct, but he made them for his mother's sake, and in his own strength. And so, though at that moment lihe really meant to be a good boy, and obey his father, and never leave the Sunday-school again, he had not courage to confess how many times during that summer he had been a truant. After his mother was gone, he fell asleep very soon, for the fatigue and excitement of the two days were telling on him. He made up his mind that lie would be a better boy in the future, and lie did- not doubt that lie would be able to follow out his good intention. We shall see. 4 . l  I   llJ T PR EPARING TO  UXN A WA Y. "I was a wayward child, I did not love my home, I would not hear my father's voice, I longed afar to roam." WHLE  Tommy was dressing himself the next morning he remembered his resolution of the night before. But he did not kneel down and ask his heavenly Father for help to keep it. He did not feel that this was necessary. So it is not strange that when he had gone up-stairs to his work, immediately after breakfast, the first time that his father spoke harshy to him the old hate- ful feeling came back into his heart. lie turned the wheel swiftly and spitefully - it was the only safe outlet for his impatient, heated spirit. When he had filled all the bobbins in his box and had to wait for his father to empty and return them, he got up and started down-stairs. "Don't ye dare to go roami%^ off now!" called  42   . ,   AF:ER MANJY DAYS.       43 out his father sharply. aI can't troost ye out o' me sight, it samnes! Ye 'll catch sooch a thrashin' as ye niver yit got, if ye go give me the slip agrin!" He had a strong "Irikh brogue," partic- ularly when excited or irritate.  Tommy went dQwn into the yard and leaned against the little side gate. He felt very reckless and wretched just then. It was very hard to be a good boy, after all, lie thoughtj but he did not see the right way to make it easier. Just then he spied John Bennett coming up the street. He liked John, for he had been one of the first to befriend him when he was a stranger, and the other boys made fun of him. John was not a really vicious boy, and was rather good-natured and kind, but he had been all his life in the streets, and had learned there many sinful lessons and con- tracted many bad habits and erroneous notions. He was two years older than Tommy, and like most boys of twelve years had his own notions pretty firmly fixed, and was not slow in acting upon them. Most people seem to forget that even at this age boys have a mind of their own and hold opinions and views with a clear and positive grasp.   "     TO\M MLI-R ; OR, "Halloo Tom!"John called out as he came     up. "I ha'n't seen you since we lad that good old time last Sunday. What made you run off and leave us? Did your father whip you, Tom? Mine wouldn't, I knew, and yours a'n't one of the church folks, is he?" L "No, but he whipped me; and I don't believe I can go to play with you fellows any more. He'd nearly kill me if he knew how many times I've gone off on Sundays with you." "Well, that's what I call pretty tough," said John. "You have to work hard all the week, and then can't play a bit on Sundays! If he thought 'twas wielced, now, like you say your mother does, I could see what it was for., But he don't, and it's mean in him to be so hard on you." "He's afraid I 'll get into fights, and get taken up by the police." "That's all stuff!" said John, contemptuously. "The police never touches us boys. That's all nonsense!" It was very wrong for Tommy to allow John to speak to him in this way about his father, but his own heart was so full of rebellion that he not   AFTER MANY DAYS.        45 only' permitted it, but went on to tell John how severely he had been punished, and to express his own feelings about his father's injustice and cruelty. "I wish my father was like. yours ;" he said. "I can't never do like the other boys, and I'm so tired of being kept down so close." Now John's father was in fault quite as much as Mr. Miller, though in another way. He was a jolly good-natured man, who never got in a passion, or punished. his children for anything. But he let them "run wild," and did not even try to exercise any control over them; so that they had no home influences to keep them from evil habits. His wife was very much like him, though she had once or twice felt a little anxious about her children, and tried to get them under some religious teaching and influence.  She seemed to realize her responsibilities as a parent a little more than her husband did, but not enough to make any firm effort to discharge them. . John, brought up under such lax discipline, or rather lack of discipline, was a poor adviser for Tommy in his present state of feeling. He grew very indignant listening to his friend's story.   it     TOLU MQ -lLJUl4. ; O,         i "I'll tell you what, Tom," he said, "if I was you, I'd run away! That's what I'd do! Bill Saunders has run away from home for less than that, only just because his father would not let him go out of nights with the boys. - Yes sir, if my father was like yours, I'd run away quick enough?" "I would, if I knew where to go to,"' said Tomy stoutly, for John's sympathy and advice made him feel very bold. "I'll tell you where to go," said John; "I know where Bill went. He said he was going up on the canal. They pay you three dollars a month to ride the horses on the tow-path. Just go up there and get work for yourself, and let the old , man find out what it is to wind his own bobbins." "A'n't I too little for them?" asked Tommy. "No, I guess not. Bill's older than you,-as old as me, but he a'n't muc bigger than you are. You see, it takes small boys. I'd coax father to let me go, if he didn't let me have such good times here." "I guess you are too big," said Tommy. le knew John's desire to be considered large and manly, and said this on purpose to please him.   Tom had begun to chew tobacco, thinking it would make him seem older and more important among the boys. "Well," said Tommy, after a pause, "I believe I'll go. I won't be whipped that way again, and I a'n't a going to be shut up in the house all the tihe when the other boys can play as much as they want to. What time would you try it, John?" "Oh, at night, of course. Just pick up what clothes you want to take along, and make 'cm up in a bundle, and hide 'em in the yard or in your bed, and then when they're all abed and asleep, get up and climb out of your window on, to the 1I  kitchen-roof, and so on to the fence, andc jump down outside of the gate." How many foolish boys have reached twelve years of age without having perfected a theory of running away, in all its details? "But mother keeps all my clean clothes in her chest, and it is locked up," said Tommy. "Well, can't you find out where she keeps the key?" "Oh, yes; it always hangs on a nail in the closet."    48     TOM MTTTR R; OR, "That's easy enough, then. But you'll want some money to bu something to eat before you hire out. I've got twenty cents I'll lend you." "And I've got a shilling of my own in my best trousers-pocket," said Tommy. "A shilling! what's that?" said John. "It's money," replied Tommy, "like we had in Ireland. But it's good here, too, mother says." "That's all right then,"/' said Jolhn. "You'll get along first rate. I wish I was a going with you, but father lets me do as I've a mind, and there's no use in my going. I can enjoy myself here!" Just then Mrs. Miller came to the door, and called her son. His father was asking for him up-stairs.     I "Which way shall I go?" he whispered, as she came towards them. "Oh, right up the canal,-you know where that is," said John hurriedly. "Good-bye, Tom. I'm coming by y ur house to-night at supper- time." So Tommy went into the house and back to his work with the neNw purpose pretty firmly fixed in his willful head.-It pleased him all day, when- ever his father spoke harshy to him, to think   AFTIr R MANY- DAYS.      49 how frightened he would be when he found he was really gone. "I guess he'll think that is dis- - grace," he muttered to himself, "and everybody'll know why I went, for John wrill tell them." Hle would not allow himself to think of his mother's feelings. "All the boys say a fellow shouldn't be tied to his mother's apron all his life," he said to himself. "She's got to part with me some time. Besides, I'll come back one of these days with plenty of money, and buy her everything she wants, and she'll be glad I went away." Tommy's mind being fully made up to run away, he at once began his preparations. After thinking it over, he decided not to go at midnight as John advised, but to wait until the next eve- ling, which was Wednesday, and go while his mother was at prayer-meeting. Tommy had a good deal of shrewdness, and he thought that if a policeman saw a boy jumping over the fence, or walling swiftly with a bundle, at midnight, he would at once conclude something was wrong, while at eight or nine in the evening lie would not be noticed at all. The only difficulty-now was to get away without his father's knowledge. I.    50t was very seldom that Mr. Miller went out in, It was very seldom that Mr. Miller went out in the evening. He stayed at home, smoking by himself, and generally went to bed early. After study  on it a while, Tommy thought he would ask permission to go to the meeting and come home with his mother. This he was sometimes allowed to do when the night was dark, anl no other women went with her from the neighbor- hood. He thought, too, that it would be best to wait until his mother was gone, before getting his clothes out of the chest in her bed-room. He saw John Bennett on Wednesday morning, and told him of the change in his plan, and John promised to mneet him on South street, at half-past eight, and walk to the caiial with him. Now, that his plans were all settled, Tommy did begin to feel a little worried about leaving home, though, as we have seen, lie did not mind leaving his father. And yet Mr. Miller really loved his children. He worked very hard for their support, was very anxious to lay up some money for their future, and meant to bring them up rightly. But he had never made them feel that this was so. He showed no interest in their daily life or amusements; in fact he never seemed   AI'TER MANY DAYS.       51 to think they needed amusements at all. His advice or commands were almost always uttered il a harsh, unsympatlhizing tone. It may be that the older children could realize that underneath all this sternness their father loved them and cared for their good; 'but Tommy was not old enough to understand how that could be. He did not suppose that his father would be pained or grieved by his going away; and the thought that he would be dreadfully frightened, and that all the neighbors would blame him for being so cruel to his child, gave secret pleasure to this sin- ful young heart. Tommy tried not to think at all about his mother, or how she would feel when she found that her youngest boy, her "baby," as she some- times llayfully called him, had run away from home. He crowded back the thoughts of her whenever they came. But they would return. His loving, gentle, tender mother! How she had worked for them all during that first year in America. She was not strong, but only a slen- der, frail woman, and Tommy knew that she often suffered acute pain from weakness and weariness. Yet she had washed and ironed and  52     TO: M1rrIl; OtR, scrubbed and cooked every day, trying hard to save the money that was earned, and to lake them comfortable. And how patient and faithful she had always been! How soft and pleasant her voice was! How ready her hands, how willing her feet! How she tried to make the family cheerful and peaceful and to teach her children to respect their father. And then too, how she prayed for them! Tommy knew the very spot where sheso often knelt beside the chest from which he must get his clothes that night. Not in these words, for he was not old enough to think them in this way, but id feeling, all this came over Tommny's heart many times on that day, which hee had deteirmined should be his last at homee. The tears started to his eyes as he saw her put on her bonnet and shawl, after washing tie supper dishes, and prepare to go to the praYr- neeting. ie tAhought how long it wol be before he saw her again. But there was no time to lose. As soon as she was gone he hurried to get the key and go to the bed-room to make up his bundle. It was a very simple affair, and took but a few minutes to tie   AITiR MANSt DAYS.       53  together. He came down-stairs, and slipped out slily behind his father's chair, as he sat smoking in front of the stove, and hid the bundle in the   i back yard. It was now half-past seven o'clock. He returaed to the house to wait until eight l and then ask leave, to go for his mother. He took his book and sat down opposite his father behind the stove. I do not think he read much, and the minutes seeimed to move very slowly. He watched the hands of the clock and listened to its ticking. He had never heard it sound half so distinctly before. "Don't-go-Tom-my!- Don't-go-Tom-my!" the old clock seemed to say. But Tommy was determined that he would go. Hte had some of his father's inflexibility and deci- sion, and had no idea of giving up his plans. lie was bold, firm and persevering, and had made up his mind. He would show them  what a boy could do! It wanted but five minutes to eight. The im- portant question must be asked, and he had not yet made up his mind what course to pursue if his father refused to let him go after his mother. lie got up and yawned. 5 :   54     T0M MLLER; OR, "I'm tired sitting so still, father," he said, "can't I go 'round to the meeting for mother?" "Your mother'd ruther you was in bed," his father answered. "It's pretty dark out of doors," ventured Tommy, "and Miss Jeffries did not go with her. She's all alone,. I guess. Maybe you'll go after her, father?" That would suit his purpose quite as well as the original plan. "No, I'm too tired. If she will go to meeting, she may get home without me. But you can go, if you won't play by the way, and keep her waitin' Maybe she'll expect you, for Sam brought her home last week." - Tommy drew a breath of relief, and then as his eye fell upon his shoes he thought he would go and put on his best ones. He went'again into the bed-roon His father thought he had gone for his hat. He sat doiwn on a little foot-stool he had made for his mother out of some bits of blocks, and began hurriedly to change his shoes. It was almost dark in there; only a faint light shone through the crack in the door. Just then the 'thought came into his mind,   , AFITER IrAxY DAYS.       55 "Right here is where mother kneels down to pray for me!" He almost realized that the God to wholm she prayed, the dear Jesus who was her best friend, was there now. He remembered how many, oh  how many times, she had told him about that loving Saviour who knows when we do wrong, who loves us and helps us when we try to do right for His sake. Was it all true and real? The boy began to feel it, for the first time in his life. Might this Friend be his also? But He seemed to be so far away. He could not tell how to find Him, how to go to Him, and ask Him to be his friend. Then he remembered that she said He knew all he thought as well as all he did, and sent the Holy Spirit to persuade and help us to do right and to love Jesus. Was it that Spirit which was whispering all these things to his heart now? Sometaing brought his mother's teachings, and the words he had read and heard from the Bible, into his mind as they had never been brought before. These thoughts,-feelings rather, for the boy was too young to think clearly on these things,- passed very quickly through his mind.   56     rTOM MTTTjERP,; OR, How could he go?  Would it not break his dear mother's heart? Would it not grieve the Saviour who loved him and watched over him, illn answer to his mother's prayers? The sin he was about to commit appeared to him now so clearly and plainly that he dared not go farther in it. A moment more, and Tommy Miller was on his knees beside the chest, sobbing, but also praying, really praying, for the first time in his life. When his mother came home, half an hour later, she found him still there upon his knees, crying. His father had fallen asleep in his chair, and had not even noticed that Tommy did not leave the house.    Mrs. Miller was frightened at first, on finding / her child in such distress, and feared that he had received another punishment from his father. But listening a moment she heard him say, "O God in heaven, forgive me, and help me to be a good boy!' The joyful thought came into her mind that perhaps the Spirit had impressed a sense of his sins upon his young heart, and she was glad. How glad, let mothers tell who have for years prayed and agonized over their loved ones before Gol,-   AF-TER]  MANY DAYS.      57 and after long delay and fear and anxiety, have seen the first glimpse of the coveted blessing, the first drops of the long hoped-for shower! Tommy's heart was softened in the great strug- gle which came to him that night. He felt the sinfulness of his course, and how he had b eO grieving his mother by his disobedient and st b- born conduct. Duiing that solitary half houi '1e had been nearer to God than ever before, and 1 Ad felt that his sins made him unfit for heaven. He had resolved to tell his mother as soon as she came, not only of his plan for running away, but also of his frequent deceit and disobedience dur- ing the summer. Mrs. Miller said nothing to Tommy unltil she had wakened her husband. The boy, hearing her voice, rose from his knees and sat down on his little stool. Then his mother called him to go to bed, and went with him up- stairs. There, kneeling before her with his head in her lap, he told her all. She was at first quite shocked to know where her boy had been, when she had thought he was at Sunday-school, on all those bright Sabbath afternoons of the past summer. But it was a great comfort to see him so penitent and ready to   58     TROM: MTT,TjIE; OR, confess his fault. On the whole she felt happier and safer about him, even while she was hearing the story of his wrong-doing, than she had ever felt before. Her feeling was not strange, for in true repentance before God lies our only hope of safety, and Tommy did seem to be truly re- pentant. Mrs. Miller tried, oh how earnestly, now, to lead him to the Saviour. There was time only for a few words, however, for her husband was fastening the doors and win- dows, and calling to her to come down and go to bed, muttering something to himself about "spoil- ing the boy with her endless nonsense and baby- ing." But the faithful mother lingered with her boy. She told him once more that dear "story of the cross,"-how God's own Son came down to die in our stead, for our sins, and that God will only pardon and accept us as His children when we come in Jesus' name. Then she prayed for him and left him, with a hopeful heart, believing that one, at least, of her children would be a Chris- tian. "John Bennett knows about my going away,   AAFTER MCA NY DAYS.      59 nmother," Tommy whispered, as she was about to leave him. "What shall'I tell him?" "Can't you tell him just the truth, Tommy?" "I don't know," he said, hesitating, " he'll laugh at me, and call me a coward, and say I a'n't - brave enough to do anything I try to do." That was Tommy's greatest trouble. His mother had felt it before. He was not brave enough to submit to be called a coward, which is perhaps one of the severest tests of true bravery. Mrs. Miller reflected a moment. She must help her boy through this trial if she could. "His laughing and calling you a coward will not hurt you," she said; "but if lie asks you why you did not go, invite him to come and sleep with you to-morrow night and he shall know." l"    IV. RESOLUTIONS-NOTlFIYG lTOROE.  "Till to Jesus' cross you cling By a simple faith, 'Doing' is a deadly thing! 'Doing' ends in death!"         ] THOMAS thought so much about John Ben- nett and of what he would say of his failure to go, that his mind was diverted from  the thoughts and feelings of the evening, though they were not forgotten. He tried to pray for himself is his mother had directed, but soon fell asleep and dreamed that as he was going to Sunday-school all the boys he knew stood on the pavement and pointed at him for a coward, hooting and hissing as he went by. In the morning he felt that he ought to try to overcome this feeling of shame, that he had not been successful in carrying out a wicked act, and he partly succeeded in doing so. 60   / After thinking it over many times, he concluded to follow his mother's plan, and ask John to come and sleep with him. He doubted whether he would come, or have anything to say to him. Still, he knew that John was kind at heart, even- though he was sometimes rude, and he hoped he might not despise him for not leaving home. If he could only get John to agree not to tell the other boys about it it would not be so bad. It was a hard task for Tommy, but the sooner he saw John and had it over, the better. He hurried his work so as to get permission to go down to the gate. Ie felt certain John would be waiting somewhere near to find out what was amiss with their plans. He was right, for as soon as he appeared at the gate, John came up. Poor silly Tommy! His knees trembled and the blood rushed up into his face till it was crim- son. The foolish boy thought there was nothing so bad as to be looked upon as a coward, but he was experiencing something much worse in being one. "Well, Tom, what was the fuss last night? They ha'n't found you out, have they? Couldn't ' you get off? Going to try again to-night?" 6    62     TOM MTTTFnR; OnR, Tommy was sorely tempted to say "yes," to this last question, and to act upon the suggestion. It seems hard to believe, when we think of him on his knees only the evening before, praying for forgiveness for this very sin. All! it is only one proof more of the deceitfulness of the human heart, and of its unwillingness to yield uncondi- tionally to the terms of pardon. He resisted the temptation, however. That night of repentance, tears and remorse, had at least made him afraid to tell another lie. But his tongue almost refused to move when he tried to speak. "I made up my mind-that is-I thought-I had rather not-I did not care about-"' He could not finish the sentence; the contempt- uous expression on John's face was too much. The most pitiable coward in the world is the one who dares not do right for fear of ridicule. "Whew!" whistled John, "I really did not think you were such a spooney as that! I s'posed you had the clear grit in you! Even if you got found out, I(ight of course you'd try again." Tommy did ot reply. "And you've give it all up, have you?"John   AFTER M:AIN-Y AAYS.      63 went on. "If I a'n't dead beat! Stay at home and be licked every time you stir out o' doors! I'm ashamed of you. I thought you was more of a man, or I'd never 'a had anything to do with you. If you can't take your own part, a little, I won't never come taround you again!" Tommy got desperate and spoke out. John could not think any less of him than he did, at any rate, and he would just let him know some- thing about how he felt, and how the thing looked to him last night. "I knew you'd think I was a coward, John," he said faintly, "but my mother is good to me, if father isn't, and I couldn't go and leave her." "How the boys would laugh at you for saying you couldn't leave your mother!" sneered John. "Well," said Tommy, "I don't care so much for myself, but it would most kill mother if I was to go. She's sick a good many times, and she might die before I got back." "Then you don't stay to home on your own account, hey?" said John, a little mollified. "No, I don't," said Tommy, "I stay for her sake. If "twa'n't for her, I'd go quick enough." "I didn't know as your mother was sick,"   "    'TO*I MTT T,PTER; On, John said; "that alters the case. I wouldn't advise any boy to go and leave his mother, if she's sick." "Oh, John," Tommy replied, "I shall be so glad if y6u say I done right. I didn't s'pose you'd see it, but I couldn't go and leave my mother, when I came to think about it." Tommy was beginning to learn the lesson it takes us all a long time to learn: that a good cause, and truth in its defence, will always make an impression even on the hardest hearts. "Yes, I guess you are right, Tom," and John t ennett actually wiped his eyes with his 'coat- sleeve, as he said it, "I'd -stay, if I was you. There's plenty of time a comin' to spite the old man in! If you're brave enough to stay and bear his thrashin's, I dun'no' but you're braver 'n you would be to go." Tommy took courage and delivered his mother's invitation, though it was now scarcely needed. The dreaded interview became pleasant and conifi- dential after the utterance of those few words of truth, even uttered in weakness and shame, and John Bennett respected Tommy Miller as he never had done before.   * AFT13R M:ANY DAYS.      65 He had always liked Tomniy's mother, for she spoke kindly and respectfully to him, as if she thought him worthy of notice. He liked to go to the house, even though they did have to keep pretty still, looking at books, or talking in whis- pers, for her smile was always kind and cheer- ful, and he felt that she wished to make them happy. So he readily. promised to come and stay with Tommy that night. It was about eight o'clock when he knocked at their door. Mrs. Miller opened it and made him welcome with a few pleasant words and a smile. She gave him a chair near Tommy, and then told the latter there were some nuts in the back room, which they might crack and eat. Mr. Miller sat by the table mending a shuttle, and spoke to John as- pleasantly as -he ever spoke to any boy. The fact was that Mr. Miller's mind was almost entirely set on one object, and that was to make money, and "get on" in the world. And this object had come to look so large to him that everything else had grown proportionally small in his eyes. He had come to America on account 6  'v:    E   "     TOM MXJtX fL- OR, of the wonderful stories he had heard of the high wages here, and he was trying very hard to earn and save all the money that he could. Thre love of money always grows stronger very rapidly when once it becomes the chief desire, and it was so with him. lie thought he w  as only doing his duty by his family, and did not realize that day after day he lost his interest in everything that could not directly put money in his pocket. Tommy's brothers, John and Samuel, were now working at a livery stable, and had to sleep there at night, So he was the only one of the children who spent the night at home, though they both came there to their meals. His oldest brother was now married. After John and Tommy had eaten their nuts, and looked over a book Mrs. Miller gave them, which had several pictures in it, Mr. Miller said it was time they were in bed. They took off their shoes by the stove for the nights were now getting quite cold, and Mrs. Miller brought a candle from the back room and went up-stairs with them. She set the candle down on a chair, and then sat down herself upon the bed.   AFTER MANY 3DAYS.       .67 t "Tommy says you know all about his plan for running away from home," she said to John. "Yes, ma'am," he replied, looking a little frightened, "I said it would be better than to be  yes, ma'am, he told me he was going up on the ca/nal." "You are older than Tommy is; did you think it was right for him to make up his mind to go?" "Well, yes, ma'am, I told him I would go if I was him. I thought it was too bad for him not to have any fun like the rest of us boys, or else get whipped if he did." "And you thought it was better for a little boy like my son Tommy to go off among strangers, to have no home, no father and mother, brothers or sisters, than to do without a part of his play- time?" "I didn't think about it in that way, Mrs. Miller; I didn't think about you at all when I told Tommy to run away, for it was me put him up to it. But if I'd thought about you, I wouldn't have done it." "Then you think it is right for some boys to run away?" Y -*   68 W    rmTOM MTT r sT,! ; OR, "Why, yes, ma'am, I never thought it wasn't, when they wasn't well used to home." "Don't you think it is better to bear some hardships, even what you may think is injustice and ill-treatment, and obey your parents and try to do right, than to risk what might come if you left them?" "I don't know -  n-guess it is," said John. "I told Tommy is morning, though I never thought of it that way before, I told Tom that maybe he was braver to stay to home than he would be to go." "How do you think I would have felt to- night, John, if my little boy had gone off into the world alone last night, and I did not know where he was?" "I'm real glad Tommy did not go, Mrs. Miller, indeed I am," John replied with trembling voice and moist eyes. "And now, John, I want you to promise that you will never advise another boy to run away, until you know how his mother feels about it. Will you?" "Yes, ma'am," after a pause. "I never thought about it that way before, Mrs. Miller. I won't   A-T:EwR 1VtANY DAYS.      69 never tell any boy he'd better run away again, especially when he's got a good mother." "What do you think about it, my son?" she asked, turning to Tommy. "Oh, mother," he said, "you needn't be afraid of me ever wanting to go again. Father may whip me every day, but I'll never leave you as long as you live." "That's right, Tom!" said John, approvingly. "I wish my mother loved me as well as yours does you," he added, half sadly. "No doubt she does, John," said Mrs. Miller, "only perhaps she has not the time to talk to you about it. But now there is another thing, John. Tommy goes to Sunday-school. It is a very nice school, and he has a good kind teacher. Wouldn't you like to go?" "I went to one once--"John hesitated. He lid not like to refuse, but no idea was more epulsive to him than that of a Sunday-school. "And didn't you like it?" "No, ma'am, not much. It was so dull. 'We ad to sit very still, and the teacher was cross, nd I didn't know what the words meant, and I lid I never would go again."   70     TME MVILIL]TER; 01R, "Suppose you try going with Tommy next Sunday," said Mrs. Miller, cheerfully. "This one may be,-in fact I -know it is, very different from that you speak of. Go just once, and see if you don't say so." "Oh John, I wish you would," said Tommy. "You don't like it, do you?" inquired John. "Well, yes, I like it when I'm there," replied Tommy, remembering, as he did so, how many times he had said to the boys he hated it, for fear they would consider him silly and babyish if he owned to liking it. ' "I really do feel good when I am in my class," he continued. "Mr. Rushton is very pleasant, and tells us a great many nice stories. I ha'n't been half so happy since I began to run away." How strange it seemed to Tommy, talking in this way to John Bennett, the boy of all others he had always felt afraid of when anything was said about religion or Sunday-schools! "Well, John, what do you think? You know it will be very easy to leave if you really can't stay.- Won't you go with my boy next Sun- day?" "I don't know but I will-yes,-I guess I'll   AFTER MANY DAYS.       71 go,/seeing I have plenty of time to play on other days," said John, at last. "But I don't believe I'll like it." "I hope you will, I believe you will. Do you pray at night and morning, John?" "No, ma'am, I don't know any prayer." "Would you like to know one?" "Well, I don't see the use of it," said John frankly.    k "This is the use of it. God in heaven is our father, the father of every human being. He takes care of us all our lives. Isn't there use in thanking Him?" "Iie does it just the same whether we thank Him or not, don't He?" answered John. "But He has told us to thank Him, and to ask Him for what we need. Should we not obey Him?" "Yes," said John. "If anybody's done us a great deal of good, and asks us to thank him, or tell him what more we want, I think we ought to do it." "That is just it," said Mrs. Miller. "Now Tommy prays every day, at least I hope he does, he has been taught to do so. I'am going to pray   72     ITOM MTjILER; OR, with him to-night before I leave you. Will you kneel and join in prayer?" Probably for the first time ':l his life John Bennett fell on his knees while Mrs. Miller prayed simply and earnestly, for Jesus' sake to the Father in heaven. And satisfied now that her boy was safe for the present from evil influence in this direction, she bade them good-night. She had met and dis- armed Tommy's dreaded foe with loving, earnest words on her lips, and God's grace and truth in her heart. John Bennett was soon asleep. But Tommy seemed to grow more wakeful and uneasy as the house grew quiet, and the stillness of night set- tled down upon the streets. Ever since he knelt beside the chest that night when he gave up run- ning away, he had had a strange feeling of sad- ness and agitation whenever he was alone. The teachings of his mother, all the invitations of the Saviour which he had heard from her lips, all the promises of God to Christians, and the terri- ble punishment for unbelieving sinners, came thronging into his mind. And now as he lay upon his bed beside his   AI R IANY DAYS. 73 sleeping play-fellow, his heart grew very heavy, and he was full of fear. The burden of his sins lay upon his spirit. Hle felt very guilty in the sight of God as he thought of his past life. He was afraid to go to sleep lest he might never wake' again. How black and dreadful did his sins look to lhim then! It seemed as if God never could forgive him. He had been taught so faithfully, so tenderly, so steadily by his dear mother, and yet the older he grew the more wayward and careless and rebellious he became. He had chosen a few hours of play, and the good-will of some rude, bad boys, rather than the love of his parents and the salvation of his soul. In the darkness and silence of night the Holy Spirit was showing him his great guilt in the sight of God. He was in an agony of fear lest he should be sent to the eternal punishment re- served for unforgiven sinners. These terrible feelings kept increasing until he could bear them no longer, but sobbed and cried aloud. His mother heard hiln and came to see what was the matter. She told him again of Jesus, the blessed, loving Saviour, for whose sake only, God will forgive sinners.' She prayed with ?    74     TOM MTT2T 7FyR; OR, him, and when he grew calmer, left him alone with his convictions. Once more his intense suffering made him cry aloud, and again she went to his bedside, and before morning, still a third time she returned to comfort, pray with and point him to Jesus. When the morning dawned, Tommy was very glad and thankful. All night he had felt as if he dared not expect to see another day. But when it came, and he arose and went down stairs, although he was still thoughtful and sad, he found it easier to drive away these feelings. And this was what he tried to do, instead of asking Jesus to take them away. He began to think that he was too young to be a Christian, and again he yielded to that foolish- fear of what the boys would say. They would laugh at him, he thought, if they know he was trying to be a Christian, and never play with him again. Then he thought that he would try to be a better boy, and obey his parents, never get angry when he was scolded, and go to Sunday- school regularly every SundAy; but he need not do anything else different from the other boys, or that need be known by them.   AF^TER M:ANY DAYS.       75 ,Thus Satan tried to turn him away from the Saviour and to keep him from yielding his heart, by making him think that he could become good by himself. As the day passed on, his deed sense of his great sinfulness in the sight of God gradu- ally wore away. Less and less he thought about the Saviour through whose intercession only he could be pardoned. He formed plans and resolu- tions to make himself better and acceptable to God, putting farther away the thought, that his mother had tried so hard to make him realize, that first of all he must come to Jesus and be for- given, for His sake. After that his good resolu- tions and efforts for a better life should be made, from love to Him who died for us and saves us. So, though the Holy Spirit had been pleading with him, and showing him his guilty heart, yet Tommy allowed Satan to persuade him to neglect Jesus, and to try to save himself. His conscience grew more quiet after he had promised himself that he would be a good boy in future, and his painful anxiety about his salva- tion wore away. It certainly was not wrong for Tommy to re- solve to improve his conduct.' Oh, no. But he   76     TOM: M[II j1Er, OR, did not begin right. He should first have ob- tained forgiveness of his sins, by giving his whole heart to Jesus, and through His merits have been accepted as a child of God. Christ would not have diedfn the cross to save us, if we could have saved ourselves in any way. I have now given you the history of Tommy Miller's first year in America. He was a member of an excellent teacher's class in Sabbath-school; he had a loving, faithful, Christian mother; he had been brought to see his sinfulness; he had resolved to be a good boy in the future. Surely there was much reason to hope and believe that the next time we take up his history we should find him growing in wisdom and goodness, a far better boy than we left him. For has he not made the most faithful promises, the most earnest resolutions? But, even supposing that he had made his out- ward life correct and obedient, had he become acceptable in the sight of God? What do you think who are reading this story? No! There is but one way whereby we may be saved. Tommy had not taken that way. Jesus says, "No man cometh unto the Father, but by   AFT3ER :MAINY DAYS.      " me." He says again, "I am the way." Tommy had not gone that way, but had tried to climb up another way. So he was as far from God as ever. We shall see how he succeeded in his efforts to become obedient, truthful and honest toward. his parents and teachers. Worldly and selfish motives will sometimes keep one firm to such a purpose. Surely in his sufferings and punish- melit Tommy had seen that "the way of trans- gressors is hard." Even for this world only it pays to be upright in conduct, faithful, honorable, trustworthy. Perhaps if Satan were not always tempting us through the inclinations of our wicked and deceitful hearts, we should always be able to see this. truth, and act upon it. Some people do seem to do so, and so become very good people in all outward acts, without being Chris- tians. If they do it from  worldly motives, "Verily they have their reward." But if they are seeking by their "doing" to enter heaven, we can only point them to the words of Jesus: "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved ;" but "he that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but elimbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber." 7 *,-   V. PREPARING TO GO WEST. "Dear children. here are dwelling Neglected and astray, Whose little hearts are swelling To learn of Zion's way: We bear to them the treasure, Bid youthful exiles come; There is no sweeter pleasure Than preaching Christ at home." FOUR years had passed since the events of the last chapter.  It was again autumn, and a clear, chilly evening late in September. A bright fire glowed in an open grate in the spacious sit- ting-room of Mr. Rushton's house. It was a handsomely  furnished apartment, every  article bearing witness to the presence of wealth and refined taste. A second glance was not needed to establish the fact that it was a Christian home, for the Bible lay upon its own stand, ready for 78   AF: TER MANY DAYS.       79 morning, and evening prayers, and Scripture scenes and characters appeared in many of the fine engravings upon the walls. Tea was just over and the family gathered around the table for the evening. First came the reading of Scripture, a hymn and an earnest, simple prayer. Mr. Rushton did not delay family worship to a late hour, when the younger children were either in bed, or too sleepy to. attend properly, but made it the key-note to the pleasant, social evening. After it was over, Gertie, now twelve years old, but wearing still the same sweet, innocent face, with its frame of soft, brown curls, got out her books and began studying her school lessons. Her little brothers Robert and Eddie played very quietly, but hap- pily, with their blocks and pictures at the oppo- site side of the table. Mr. and Mrs. Rushton sitting near each other by the Bible stand, were talking of the Sunday- school, of which he was now superintendent. At a time when very few Christians had learned the importance of this work, these two had for several years been growing more and more impressed with it, and   were earnest, zealous   laborers in its uncultivated fields. Week by week they went out into alleys and courts to gather in neglected little ones, and taught them patiently and hopefully in spite of all discourage- ments. To support the school they gave freely of the abundance with which God had blessed them. They loved it and sought its prosperity with -an interest scarcely less earnest and warm than that they felt for their own family circle. They often talked and prayed over it together, and on this night they were speaking of its past, and calling to mind one by one many of its earlier pupils. "Do you remember," said Mrs. Rushton, sud- denly looking up from her hemming,-for, wealthy as she was, she had always some bit of work at hand, "do you remember that it was four years ago this fall that John Bennett entered the school?" "So it was; just about this time. What a hard task I had to interest and keep him! Sev- eral times I thought he must be given up, it was so hard to get him into regular attendance." "He could not bear restraint of any kind, never having been used to it. There was nothing but his own desires to guide him, no influence   AFTER} MANSY DAYS.       81 bat his own wishes to appeal to, and those desires and wishes seemed to lead him anywhere but toward the school." "Yes; - for k long time I almost gave him up; and see what he is to-day! A   Christian, a church member, an intelligent, influential boy. No youth in the school exerts so wide and good an influence." "He has a strong, decided character. How quietly, but how constantly he has worked dur- ing this last year to get his parents to come regularly to church. And he is succeeding. His mother comes very often and is, I think, anxious about her own salvation." "Yes, and his father was there on Sunday evening. John looked up at me so bright and happy as they came in. Mrs. Miller tells me that the family are so different at home, too. John reads the Bible and has prayers at flight and morning, and they all respect him. Even his father and mother support his authority and teaching with the children, and are so proud of him, Mrs. Miller says." "Poor Mrs. Mtiller!" Mrs. Rushton spoke very tenderly and colnpassionately.   82     TOM MLLjER,; OR. "Poor Mrs. Mille!" echoed her husband. "So many years she has waited and hoped and prayed for her husband and children and yet has seen no change." "It almost broke her heart when Thomas was drawn away again and lost his interest in religious teaching," said Mrs. Rushton. "She has not seemed to me to be the same woman since Thomas was, apparently, so near giving his heart to Jesus, just about the time that John Bennett was so indifferent. Now  he seems perfectly unconcerned, while John at sixteen years old, is preparing for a life of Christian usefulness." "Papa," said Gertie, who was listening now, rather than studyink, "what has become of Tommy Miller?  He has not been at Sunday- school for a long time, has he?  I never see him."  "He is still at home, daughter, but I fear is growing more and more careless and wicked. I think there are sometimes violent quarrels between him and his father, and harsh as the man is, he fears his. boy's temper, and avoids offending him of late." "His mother says he is always kind to her, at   A:IT:ER MANIY DAYS.       83 least never openly unkind," said 1Mr1 Rushton. "He listens when she talks to him of religion, but is perfectly cold and unfeeling on the sub- ject." "She is so good to him that I don't see how' he could be unkind to her," said Gertie. "He deceives her, however," replied her father. "He is now connected with a gang of idle, wild boys, whose opinion is worth more than anything else to him. I have good evidence that he swears and, breaks the Sabbath habitually, now, but I suppose his poor mother does not know it." Mr. Rushton, like some good teachers and superintendents at this day, was thoroughly acquainted with the history and habits of mos t of the boys in the neighborhood, even those who had never been his scholars, though they knew nothing of his interest and observation. "It is only another proof that no one can stand still in this world," sighed Mrs. Rus'hton. "Tommy would not go forward, so he has gone backward. I think he tried for a while to be *regular at the school, and dutiful to his parents, but such efforts made in his own strength were   84     TOM MLLER; OIR, weak as a rope of sand when tested by the sneers and temptations of wicked companions." "Yes Thomas Miller at fourteen is a very different boy from Tommy Miller at ten, and all for the worse;" said Mr. Rushton. "But we must not give him up. I am- sometimes utterly discouraged as to getting him back to his place in school; but I shall keep trying." "It seems as if so faithful a mother's prayers must be answered some time or other," rejoined his wife, "but I must confess that if there ever was a seemingly hopeless case it is in the family of Mrs. Miller. They appear to be growing more hardened and callous every year." "Tommy was such a bright, pretty boy, papa," said Gertie. "You know we all used to think he would soon be so good and useful." "True; I thought him much nearer to the fold than John Bennett. He has been so well taught by his mother, and loves her so well." "We must keep him in sight," said Mrs. Rushton. "Oh,-what-did you find out about that Purdy family?" And so the conversation turned to other subjects.   AFTER MA=:NY DAYS.       85 / But in accordance with a promise made to her- self at that time, Mrs. Rushton went to see Mrs. Miller very soon after. She had always, felt an unusual interest in this family, and was resolved, to be of what assistance and comfort she could to that faithful moQther, in keeping watch over the spiritual interests of her children. They lhad failed to get the girls to attend Sabbath-school. Their mistresses would spare them only every other Sunday afternoon, and they were not willing on that half-day to be shut up in the Sabbath- school. The new acquaintances they had formed went out to walk or visit when their Sunday came, and Mary and IKaty liked to do the same. Ann had now been married more than two years, and was living in Kensington, where Robert and his wife also lived. Now that Tommy had left the school, there was not one of the family who paid the slightest attention to religious duty except the mother. Mr. Miller was to all appearance just the same. Hard-vorking, free from the vices of drink and gaming, devoted to what he believed were the interests of his family, yet stolid, unsympa- thizing, violent and arbitrary, his was not a 8   86     XTOM M3IILER; OR, happy life, nor did he contribute to the happiness of others. When Mrs. Rushton entered, she found the faithful wife and mother sitting alone, looking very sad and anxious. She was busy sewing, and had the full basket of shirts and stockings to be mended, by her side. The kind visitor saw at a glance that although Mrs. Miller tried hard to receive her cheerfully, yet the tears were almost blinding her, and she was sure there was some fresh trouble. It soon came out. "My husband is making up his mind to go to the West," Mrs. Miller said, after a little. "To the West? Why, I thought he was doing very well here," said Mrs. Rushton. "His wages are good, and he is very steady." "Yes, ma'am, but he thinks he'd get along faster there. He's very anxious to get money, and it comes so slow here, he says." "To what part of the West does he think of going?" "To Illinois, 1 believe he calls it, ma'am." Illinois was a long way off in those days of slow travel, and it was a much more serious thing to emigrate than it is now.   AFTER MANY DAYS.        87 / "What will he do 1here?   I fancy there cannot be much weaving to do in those new coun- tries." "He is crazy to get on a farm, ma'am. He says that land is so cheap, that any one can own a farm for himself." "How do you feel about going, Mrs. Miller?" "I'd rather stay," she answered promptly, but with a trembling voice. "I'm just getting used to it, and I don't like to be changing my home." "Perhaps it will be better for the children there. There cannot be so much evil company where they have to work hard, and live so far apart." "Begging your pardon, ma'am, I don't think there's much difference in places about that. If the heart is set against Jesus and a Christian life, it will find opportunities for showing it any-' where." "Don't you think the temptations and snares of the city help to set the heart against re- ligion?" "Maybe they do. But there are often oppor- tunities for learning about good things in the   88     TOM; MLLElR; OR, city, which we do' not expect to find in a new country." "-So you think if the heart is given to Jesus, the temptations of the city are easily resisted, and if it is not given that the country life will afford abundant means for evil courses." Yes, ma'am, it seems so to me. And the city has the ministers and the schools and good peo- ple's influence to help one along in a Christian life, while in the new country often there's no preaching nor Sunday-schools." "Will all the children go with you?" asked Mrs. Rushton after a little pause. No; Katy will go, and the three boys. Robert, Ann and Mary will stay here." Just then Mr. Miller came into the room. Mrs. Rushton shook hands with him cordially, and he seemed more animated and sociable than usual. "Your wife tells me you are thinking of emi- grating again-?" the lady said inquiringly. "Yes, ma'am, I does that," said le, lhis broad, rough tones and Irish brogue contrasting strongly with his wife's quiet voice and almost pure English pronunciation.       MEN Down the Ohio. Chap. VII.    AIF'TErE, MANY DAYS.     89 "What has made you think it best to go?" "Why, ma'am, soomn ov me friends is gone, last year, and they bought farrums chape on the peraries, an' the land is very fine too." This was the great attraction to Mr. Miller: The idea of owning a farm seemed to be the height of earthly bliss. It is frequently so to people from the old countries, where it is impos- sible for the poor to own land, its value is so great. "It's a great country is the West," he went on, "and especially Illenoy. The peraries are grand, and the soil so deep and rich, they say. It's the place for a poor mon, sure; and I think we' ll be goin' as soon as the things can be sold an' the rist packed up." "Well, if you are determined to go, Mr. Mil- ler, I hope you may do well and be prospered in all things. We shall be sorry to lose you and your family. Every steady, industrious man is a credit to his neighborhood, and you have always been sober and respectable. I do not doubt you will do well anywhere so long as you remain so." "Thank you, ma'am. I shall niver do aught ilse. No doubt I shall git along well, if I can 8 *   90     TOM MLLER; OR, once own a bit o' that perarie. Why, ma'am," he added, getting warmed with the subject, "they say the grass is as tall as a mon on a horse's back! I'd ruther ha' tin akurs an' a coo's grass, than to ha' all Filadelfy!" "Your wife is not strong, Mr. Miller; re- member, farming will be hard work, and you must be careful of Mrs. Miller in that new coun- try," said the lady. "Yis, ma'am, of coorse, an' the counthry air'll do her good, I belave. She is always thin an' pale like, but she's stout for all." Mrs. Rushton sighed. "If you had only so good a Friend as she has to go with you, -Mr. Miller, I should be glad." He knew what she meant, but did not answer. "A friend that sticketh closer than a brother." "A very present help in trouble," she added. "Surely, Mr. Miller, if you would but make Jesus your best friend, you would be more blessed than to own all the fertile prairies of Illi- nois." "I always thries to do my dooty," muttered the man, "I wrongs nobody, and worruks hard   AFTITSR M-NY DAYS.      91 for the wife an' childher. If he's not my friend it's not the fault of mesilf!" "Oh, Mr. Miller, it is not what you do, but where your heart is, that God looks at. If you don't do these things for His sake, you might as well leave them undone, for all the aid they will be to your soul's salvation. If you do well from earthly motives, you may get earthly rewards, but if you work for God's glory, He will bless and glorify you forever." It was very plain he had heard it many times, but he had suffered "the god of this world" to blind his eyes, and would not receive the truthl. "I hoped to see Tommy," Mrs. Rushton said as she rose to go, "but as he is out, I will not wait. Tell him that before you go away, we shall expect him to come to the house and bid us all good-bye. You are fully determined on going West, are you, Mr. Miller?" "Yis, ma'am, I shall go." "God bless you, then, and bring you all to a knowledge of Himself." "Amen," sighed Mrs. Miller, and Mr. Miller said "Thank ye!" not ungraciously. Yes, Mr. Miller had fully resolved to go West   92     TOM vt MTTER,; OR, and buy a farm. He had not got rich so fast in Philadelphia as he had hoped; but yet in the five years since he came-he had, with the help of his boys, laid up nearly a thousand dollars. This would move them, and pay for their land and necessary implements of farming. After that Mr. Miller was certain of growing rich very fast. In fact it seemed like riches to him to own land at all, and he little thought of the difference in value between a new, wild country, and one which had been settled and cultivated for years. Mrs. Miller, feeble as she was, and sorry to leave the old home and her children again, never thought of objecting to her husband's plan. He knew best about such things, she thought. The children were eager to go, for like most young* (people, they liked change and adventure. Seve- ral other families were going at the same time, with some of which they were acquainted. They packed what things they were to take in strong boxes, Tommy helping his mother all he could. He knew better than the rest just how she felt about going, and he was kinder and more thoughtfiul than usual, and seemed to try to make the work easy for her. And though it was a \   AFTER]t MANY DAYS.       93 long time since he himself had prayed, he could hardly help crying when he saw his mother kneel in her little bed-room for the last time to pray that God would watch over and guide the chil- dren she was leaving, and direct and bless them all in the new home they were seeking.   VAI BEGINNING THE JOURNEY. "Now in thy youth beseech of Him Who giveth, upbraiding not, That His light in thy heart become not dim, And His love be unforgot." HAD you seen Thomas Miller the evening before they started on their journey, as he went to say good-bye to his Sunday-school teacher, you would have called him a fine-look- ing lad. He was very neatly dressed in a suit of dark gray clothes made by his mother's hands; his hair was combed back from a full, white forehead, and his cheeks were rosy with exercise, while his eyes were bright with excite- ment and pleasurable anticipation. He looked like a boy of whom good things might be confi- dently prophesied, and yet in reality he was far from being such a boy, as we have already seen. "   AFTTER MAN-Y DAYS.     95 True, Tommy had enjoyed very few advantages compared with some boys. He had been to school less than six months during all the time they had lived in Philadelphia. But he had not improved even that time as he ought to have done. He might at least have learned to read and write, but at fourteen he knew very little more than at ten. The fact was that he had too great fondness for play and for the companionship of idle, disorderly boys, and paid very little attention to the wishes of his mother or teachers. He was a bright, ac- tive boy naturally, but was fast growing willful and obstinate in heart and manner, because he had deliberately chosen to do wrong. For the last few days he had been a hero in the eyes of the young companions who made up his world. A journey of a thousand miles was not so common then as it is now, and a boy who was to travel such a distance was regarded with re- spect. This suited Tommy's ideas very well, for he liked to feel important among his associates. Although he had so long stayed away from Sunday-school and avoided his teacher, he really liked Mr. Rushton, and was glad to accept the invitation left by his wife, to come and bid them    96     TOM MTTjTER; OR, good-bye. His visit was a short one. Mr. Rush- ton spoke very kindly to him of the future, and of his opportunities for beginning right courses in a new place. "Whatever this step may be to the rest of the family," said he, "{for you, Thomas, it will be a good thing. You can begin anew, and have no companions to hinder your efforts. Try to make the best use of this opportunity. And may God bless you, my boy!" Mrs. Rushton gave him a handsome Bible, and said, "You are the youngest, Tommy, and will perhaps be most with your mother. Be kind and obedient to her. You have a good mother, who may not always remain with you." Gertie gave him a card upon which a beautiful little hymn was printed, and each of the little boys had a gift for him; Robert a picture-book, and Eddie a box of water-colors. "I expect you will want to make pictures of the strange and beautiful' things you see," said Gertie, "and you will find pencils and colors in Eddie's box." "We, Gertie and I, will come to the depot in the morning to see your mother off," said Mrs. Rushton. And then they all knelt down while   AFTEr:E :M ANYx DAYS.      97 Mr. Eushton, in a few earnest words, asked God to bless the boy and his family in their far away home. They thought it was best in this leave- taking to overlook all Tommy's late truancy, dis- obedience and wickedness, and treat him as if he were a scholar of the Sunday-school still. They were to begin their journey by rail. At that time there were but very few miles of rail- way track Jin the whole United States. A road had been built however from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, and these emigrant families were to go that far upon it. None of them had ever been inside of a car, and Tommy was not alone in his fear to trust himself behind the screaming, steam- ing, snorting, iron horse. If there had been a railroad all the way to St. Louis, as there now is, their journey would not have been such a serious undertaking. Tommy was so much taken up with the novelty of his position, that he did not find it very diffi- cult to say good-bye to his older brother and sis-- ters, and other friends. Not so his poor mother. She had learned to love her home in Philadelphia, her seat in the church and in prayer-meeting. She had some 9   98     TOM: VTTT,IR, ; OR, kind neighbors, some good friends, and saddest of all, she was again leaving her older children. She could not drive away the conviction that she should never see them again. She had grown too old to be attracted by the novelty. Her frame was not strong, and she shrank from the hardships and fatigue of the journey. Of the trials and sufferings of pioneer life, in a new and unsettled country, she as yet knew nothing. Could that have been foreseen, she would have been still more distressed. As it was, the bitter tears ran down her pale cheeks, even while she tried to pray for strength, courage, and faith in God. Mrs. Rushton and Gertie, in their carriage, were at the depot almost as soon as the Millers were, and stayed to see them off. Mprris, the coachman, brought a large, square, covered basket and set it down beside Mrs. Miller. It contained a new warm wrapper for herself, and numerous -delicacies to make her journey more comfortable. "There is plenty of tea, a tea-pot and cups, with sugar and crackers," Gertie whispered to Katy. "Mamma said your mother would often find a cup of tea very refreshing on the road, and you must make it for her."   A-IFTER MANY DAYS.       99 "Have you any special luggage to carry, Tommy?" said Mrs. Rushton. "No, ma'am, nothing at l11." "Then you must take charge of this basket, and see that your mother uses its contents for herself. There is a small, soft pillow under the wrapper, which you will find use for when you stop to rest. Once more, Katy and Tommy, be kind to your mother on this journey." And the lady kissed them both as she gave them this charge. After that she stood apart with Mrs. Miller, talking gravely and sweetly of their hope in Jesus, the promised rest in heaven, the tender care of our Father for His redeemed ones, and the com- forts of his service. Mrs. Miller always remem- bered the dear lady as she stood there in her sim- ple morning dress, her lovely face so beautiful with Christian love and sympathy. The bell rang, the whistle sounded, they crowded into tls cars, and so were off at last. Their speed was not so great as that of rail cars now-a- days, but they went fast enough to make Tommy's heart beat wildly with fear as they rode rumbling I and rushing along. After a little time, however,   100     TOM MILLER; OR, he began to get used to it, and to enjoy himself looking out of the window, as they passed rapidly along. It was a great while since he had seen the country, and he had very little remembrance of it. Besides, the country in America is very different from that in Ireland, and the scenes upon which Tommy looked were entirely new, and very interesting to him. He sat beside his mother, while Katy and the basket occupied the seat op- posite. John and Samuel were sitting with some other young men, and talking earnestly about the new country to which they were going.  His father was still more eager and animated in con- versation with some emigrants on the other side of the car. Mrs. Miller only sat silent, while Tommy and Katy under the pressure of their new train of ideas, q1atted as fast as possible, and al- most forgot her presence. It took them only about half a day to reach the end of the railroad, and they had expected to travel next by canal. But they found that there had been such very heavy rains the week before, that the canal banks were torn and washed away by the floods, so that no boats could run upon it. This was serious trouble to our six families of emigrants, but there was   AFTER MANY DAYS.        101 nothing to be done but to hire wagons to take them on their way. This took all the afternoon, for it was not very easy to secure so 'nany wagons at once. So they were obliged to stay that first night in Harrisburg, at a small tavern, where the women and girls slept on the floor all in one room, and the men lay about in the bar-room below, with their coats under their heads for pillows. Early the next morning they started again on their journey, in heavy lumber wagons drawn by strong horses. It took four wagons to hold the entire company with' their boxes, and then they were pretty closely packed. It was a beautiful October day. The trees had just been touched with the first autumnal frost, and the most brilliant colors were glowing on the hill-sides. Nowhere in the world, perhaps, is autumn so beautiful as in the Pennsylvania forests, and on her mountain-sides. Scarlet, crimson, gold color, green, and orange branches mingle with others of dead sober brown tint, all waving in 'the sweet, cool, bracing air which the frosts have purified. Overhead, the bluest of skies looks down, and soft, white clouds chase eacll other across it, making those ever-changing shad- 9*   102     TOM MTTl r R; OR, ows which children love to watch. The sun is no longer an enemy to comfort, as in the scorch- ing summer days, but a cheerful, friendly giver of soft warm beams to light and cheer the whole. The beauty of the day and of the landscape helped greatly to make the journey pleasant. Still it was very tiresome riding hour after hour over the rough roads, in the great, jolting wagons, especially for those women who were not strong, and for the little children. They stopped at noon by the road-side, under the shade of some trees, and one of the men built a fire of sticks which they gathered in the road. Three or four had been gathering these sticks, as they came to them, for the last hour. The women cooked some bacon they had brought with them, and potatoes which they had bought in Harrisburg, and all ate dinner. Katy got out the tea-pot from Mrs. Rushton's basket, and made a nice cup of tea for her mother. But the party only stopped a very short time, for they were anxious to get as far as possible on their way while they had good weather. Tommy began to think it was not so very pleasant to travel after all, when he climbed down   A FTETR M:MAANY"DAYS.   4103 out of the wagon that night, and felt so lame and sore that he could hardly walk. He had not rid- den all day, but he was no more used to walking on rough ground than riding over it, and he felt the fatigue very much. They cooked their supper out of doors that night, buying some milk and eggs from a farmer near by, which with their bread and meat brought from home made a good meal. As they were all clean, respectable-looking people,k they had no difficulty in getting the farmer to let them come into his house to sleep. It was a log-house, with but one room, and a loft or garret over it, in which they all slept on the floor, with their clothes on. Mrs. Miller now found use for her wrapper and pillow. The former was loose, and made soft, and warm with lining and wadding. By going up to bed a little earlier she could remove her day-clothes, put on the wrapper, and fold the former for a bed, where with her pillow under her head, she was far more comfortable than you would imagine. But before she did this, Tommy saw her leave the rest as they were sitting round the fire eating   104     TOM  ML IIFR; OR, and talking, and go alone opt to the row of wag- ons. After standing for a few moments to look at the setting sun, toward which they were to travel so long, she softly moved into the shadow of the great boxes, out of sight, and kneeling down prayed for them all. She always found a place for secret prayer. The next day, and the next, passed in about the same way as the first, and they still travelled on in their wagons. The country grew wilder, the roads rougher, the mountains higher, and they toiled up one steep mountain road after another. Near the close of the third day after leaving Harrisburg, they reached Altoona, situ- ated at the very foot of the Alleghany Moun- tains. It had been a hard day's journey, going up and down, up and down, until just as night came on, they arrived at the foot of the chief range, and were to spend the night "under the mountains  as Katy said. Altoona was then only a little town with few inhabitants, and they stopped just outside to cook their supper as usual, while some of the men went into the village to buy milk and fresh meat. Mrs. Miller looked very pale and weary. Katy   AxFITER MANY XDAYS.     105 declared she was "tired to death," as she went to the fire to cook the supper for their family. As for Tommy, he had felt really sick all day, and when they got out of the wagons at Altoona, he was glad to lie down on the ground, with his head in his mother's lap. The nights were cold in the mountains, and in fact it was getting late in the fall to be out of doors at night, though ever so warmly clothed. But this exposure was only one of the many trials to which emigrants to the West in those days were subjected. Tommy's head ached, his limbs were tired and lame, and he felt Very weak and sick. How he wished that they were at home again in the snug little house in Philadelphia. "Oh, mother," he said7 "I wish we had never started! It is so far. I heard Michael McHue tell father that we were just well started now, and I'm sure we sha'n't live to get there!" "Oh, yes, we shall," she answered as cheer- fully as she could, though no doubt she felt as badly as he did in mind and body; " oh, yes, my boy, we shall get through. I knew we should be very tired, and am not disappointed." Well, I am," Tommy grumbled. "I did \   106     TOM jiVTTTRTR; OR, not expect such trouble. I thought we should have a grand time every day. If there was any boys along, I wouldn't mind it so much, but they're all grown up, or else just babies. Oh, !mother, I'm so sick-I wish we had stayed at home!" - And big as he was, Tommy Miller was crying like a baby. But it was' too late for regrets. The journey was scarcely begun, and it was much the wisest way to be lhopeful and patient now, and not give up to weariness, or even sickness, if it were pos- sible to avoid doing so. It was some excuse for Tommy that he was really sick;, for the first time in his life, and he felt frightened and peevish.  They slept that night as they had the last before it, in their wagons, from which they lifted out some of the boxes, and then shelter d them as much as they could with a few boards and blankets. Tommy continued to feel very sick all night, and his mother sat by his side a very long time without trying to sleep. Her own fatigue and ill-health were forgotten when she saw her boy suffering. During the long and silent hours of that night, Thomas felt as he had never felt before, the   ABTrE3E, M-AY DA YS.      107 power and sweetness of his mother's love. As he lay there he remembered her unwillingness to go to the West, and realized that she was not sustained by the same motives and hopes that buoyed up the spirits of the rest of the family. Then he thought 6f her patience and fortitude in leaving without a murmur the home she loved. He thought how she sat pale and weary in the wagon day after day, and how her lips sometimes moved in silent prayer, as she gazed away from all around them at the mountains and sky. He felt, dimly it is true, but yet he felt that there was some strength beyond her own which bore her up through these trials. Thomas could not sleep. His pain and fatigue kept him wakeful. It was a good time for reflec- tion. The lonely, moonless night seemed so sol- emn and impressive, the silence broken only by the distant hooting of owls among the forests. Though he had wandered so far away from the right, his heart was not yet so hardened as to resist these influences. He thought of that other wakeful night, long ago, when he had been so near becoming a Christian. He remembered how terrible his sins seemed to him at that time. How   108     TOM MILJL^El; OR, black they must be now, he thought, with all the added misdeeds of these last four years. The deception, the Sabbath-breaking, the profanity, the neglect of opportunities for instruction; he knew all these things were wrong when he did them, but he had driven away the thought. Now the accumulated evidence of his conscience all turned back upon his mind in a resistless flood. Once more the burden of his sins was rolled upon his heart. Once more, though for two years- he had avoided the subject, he turned to his mother for aid.  L, "I wish I was a different boy, mother," he said, after a long silence. "I wish I was a Christian; then I should never do wrong." "That is a mistake, Tommy," she answered. "You would often do wrong if you were a Chris- tian; at least, most Christians do. "Why, mother, doesn't it keep any one from doing wrong to be a Christian? I thought that was what it was for." "If we look to Jesus for help, He will keep us from sin, it is true; but very few Christians look to Him so constantly that they never do wrong, though they ought to strive to do so."   AFTER MANY DAYS.       109. "Then, mother, how are they better off than sinners, if they can't keep from sin?" "If the child' of God sins, he can go at once to his Saviour, and through Him be forgiven. He knows the way to Jesus. If he sin, he has an 'Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,' as the Bible says." "But, mother, I don't understand. I think I should like to be a Christian if it would keep me from sinning, and then my wrong-doings wouldn't come up to haunt me whenever I am sick, or can't sleep at night. If it won't do that, I don't see the use." "Tommy, suppose you were a Christian, and so true and faithful a one that you could live without sin; what would you do with your old' sins?" "My old sins, mother?" "Yes, these same sins that as you say, haunt you at night. How would you get rid of them, even if you should be a true Christian and never committed any more?" "Why, mother, if I was trying to do better, don't you think I would forget them after a while?" 10   "O     TOM MLIER; OR, "Sometimes, when you have tried to do right, did you find that you forgot them?" "No, I did not.  I thought of them the more." "Yes, and you would continue to do so, the longer you tried to become good, until, as the minister used to say, you would turn back to your sins to escape from your sins." "That is just what I did do, mother. I thought the other boys didn't seem to be troubled about doing wrong, and I would do as they did, and drive off the feeling of guilt." "It. is the old sins, Tommy, that we must attend to first. How are you going to escape from the vengeance of God, when he says 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die?'" "Oh, mother, I never can escape! It is of no use to try! It is all so dark to me. God will surely punish me fearfully, because I knew better than to do as I did!" "Oh, my dear boy, can't you see that you haven't got to try?- You have only to go to Jesus, who took that fearful punishment for you. If you will only accept Him as your Saviour, He will save you. He has borne your sins on the   AFTERI  MANY DAYS.     1" cross, and all He asks in return is, that you will love Him, and obey Him the rest of your life." Tommy was silent. - Ahy is it that it is so much easier to try to make ourselves better, than it is to trust the Saviour? Why is it so hard to love Jesus? Why does not the heart at once leap up at the sound of His voice in wondering, grateful, adoring love? Can there be any other answer than this?"The natural heart, or the 'carnal mind is enmity against God!' " The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked!" Jesns knocks at the door of our hearts, and alarms the sleeping man- hood within, but Satan has possession, and per- suades us to believe that some preparation is necessary before He will enter and receive us. So we doubt and hesitate, and go on listening to the deceiver until we are led into greater sins. If we would only believe Him, when He says, "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from .all sin!"   VII. FLAT-BOATING DOFWN TBH OHO. "When morning sheds its gorgeous dye, Our hope, our heart, to earth are given: But dark and lonely is the eye     4 That turns not, at its eve, to heaven." JT was some time before Thomas spoke again, after his mother urged so strongly the neces- sity of looking to Jesus. He did not love Jesus. He felt no thrill of joy on hearing of His readi- ness to save sinners. If she had told him of some difficult way of toil and danger whereby he might save himself, it would have pleased him better. He saw his sins; he believed God would punish them; he wanted to escape. For the second time in his life he was burdened with a fearful sense of guilt in the sight of God. "What is the reason I can't do right when I make up my mind to, mother?" he said at last. "2   AFTER MANY DAYS.       113 "Because you have a wicked heart that will not help your mind to keep its resolutions; a heart so prone to sin that you cannot overcome it." "Then of course I can't help it," said Tommy, quickly, "and it isn't my fault if I don't become good." "If there was no way for you to help it, my son, you would not be in fault. You could not be blamed at all. But there is one way for you to do right." "What is that?" asked Thomas. "Ask God to help you, for Jesus' sake. What we cannot do for ourselves He has promised to do for us, if we only ask Him. Oh, Tommy, it is so easy to say '0 God, forgive me for Jesus' sake! O Jesus, accept my heart, and help me to trust in Thee alone for forgiveness and salvation!' Can't you do it?" No, Tommy could not do it, simple as it seemed. He was silent again, unwiiliing to see the Saviour as his only hope. Strange inconsis- tency! But how often is it shown. Mr. Miller, at the other end of the wagon, now turned over and raised his head to look at them. 10*   "4     TOM: MLL..E; OR, "You'd better go to bed, Jane," he said; "you're doin' that boy no good, babyin' and cod- dlin' him. Tornm, make yer mother lie down and go to sleep."  They tried to obey, and both succeeded in get- ting a little sleep before the day broke. As soon as it was light, they were all astir. The fires were rekindled, and the breakfast was hurriedly prepared while the men were busy in returning the boxes to the wagons for the last time; for one more day's journey would bring them to Johnstown, from which they were to travel by the caaal to Pittsburgh. They arrived at Johnstown late that night, and dismissed their wagoners, who were to return to Harrisburg, and the next morning were early upon a canal boat. It was a very slow way of travelling, but yet it was much easier than the wagons had been. They were crowded together on the boat, and it was very dirty and uncomfortable. Still they were thankful for the change. And during the ten days which it took them to reach Pittsburgh, Mrs. Miller and Katie, assisted by Tompy, had moved their own boxes to one side by themselves,   AFTTER M A-NYT DAYS.     115 which made quite a neat little space, or room, as they called it, where they ate and slept, and lived by themselves as much like a famnily as pos- sible.  .            RI I would like to tell you something about the other families who were travelling with the Mill- ers. But it is Tommy's life I am trying to tell you of, and really, during their long journey, the other emigrants had very little to do with Tommy. There were no boys of his own age among them, and the older men and boys paid very little atten- tion to him. They were too busy with their farm- ing and money-making schemes to think much about anything not connected with them. The women were busy cooking, and taking care of the little children, and sometimes in talking over things in the "ould counthry," and their life in Philadelphia. So the days passed very monoto- nously as they were towed along the canal, near- ing Pittsburgh day by day, until at last they ar- rived at that city. You all know how Pittsburgh is situated, even though you have never been there. Your map shows you how it stands at the junction of the two rivers, Alleghany and Monongahela, and at   "6  /  TOM MLLER; OR, the head of the noble Ohio. Down the Ohio river our travellers had to go next, and they found that it would be very expensive if they took pas- sage on one of the steamboats which were run- ning upon it. Mr. Miller and all the other men said they could not afford to pay the prices asked for taking their families to St. Louis. Tommy wondered what they would do. They were not long in deciding. Several other families happened to be at Pittsburgh, also wait- ing to be carried further on their way westward. After talking it over together, they decided to buy a flat-boat, and go down the river to Cincin- nati. I do not know that it will be easy for me to make my readers understand what a flat-boat is, if they have never seen one. To th6se who have seen such a boat no description will be necessary, but to others I will only say that it is a very low, broad boat, like a raft, with only one surface or deck, quite close down to the -water. The water in the Ohio was at this time very low, so that very few steamboats or barges could go up to Pitts- burgh; and this was the reason of the high prices D for passage on the few which could run. But a   AFTER MANNY DAsYS.      117 flat-boat lies almost on the surface of the water, and so can float where it is not at all deep. Tommy was very much interested in this plan of making their own way down the river, and talked of it to Katie and his mother all the time during the day they were waiting. Late in the afternoon he ran shouting to his mother, as she sat knitting on one of the boxes by the side of the canal, "John says they have found a boat to suit!" They had all made themselves as comfortable as they could out -of doors, while the men were busy with their arrangements to go on. It was now nearly sunset, so it was very good news to learn that a flat-boat had been found. "Have they bought it?" asked Mrs. Miller, and the other women crowded around, very much interested, for they were all getting tired of wait- ing there by the side of the canal. "Yes, they've bought it. They had to give a hundred and forty dollars for it, but they say they can sell it again for fifty or sixty when we get to Cincinnati." "That a'n't much, divided among so many," they all said, or thought. "It's a dale better than payin' fifty dollars a piece to go on the stameboat   "8     TOM :MaER; OR, that might bust afther all, an' sind us to purga- tory," the oldest woman added. So when the men came up, all excitement and hurry, saying that the boat was theirs; and that they must get their things loaded on, and ptovi- sions for the trip bought before nine o'clock, they found every one ready to assist in getting embarked as soon as possible. After two or three busy hours, there they were, about forty persons in all, settled down upon the broad surface of the flat-boat, ready to float down the rivbr. They had supplied themselves with potatoes and pork, some bread and oatmeal, and had bought a large, second-hand cooking-stove for the common use, which smoked away in the middle of the boat. Tommy, now entirely re- covered, began to think this was something like fun, and to be glad that they were going West, after all. It was very slow travelling, however, slower even than the canal-boat had been. Yet there was a sense of freedom and independence about it, that made them all enjoy it. The river was still very low, and their boat often struck upon snags, or grounded on sand-bars. Dozens of times they   ,AFT:EE MANY DAYS.      119 found themselves fast on these bars. At suchl times, all the men, taking the long poles which they had brought with them for the purpose, would jump off into the water which was some- times above their knees, and pry and push until the boat floated free again. Tommy was very fond of getting a pole and assisting in this work, until it had happened so often that it became an old story, and then he rather preferred keeping his feet dry. The weather was now getting really very chill- ing and dreary, and they all began to look forward anxiously to the end of their journey. Two of the little children among the other fami- lies died, after suffering for some days with cold and fever. Mrs. Miller comforted the poor, dis- tressed mothers, and read her Bible beside the little dead bodies, to all who would listen. They died but a few hours apart, and they stopped the boat at the edge of a forest the next afternoon, and dug the little graves side by side on the bank of the river. The sight of these little dead bodies brought back Tommy's serious feelings for a time. He was forced to remember that he, too, must die   120     TOM M1IILER; OR, and be left alone in the grave. But he drove away the thought as quickly as he could, for it made him very uncomfortable. His brothers John'and Samuel had begun to notice him more since they had been on the flat- boat, and to act as if they liked to have him come among the men, and Tommy was really forgetting many of his boyish, idle ways, and learning to think that play was not the most important thing for a boy of fourteen years to do. As he grew more and more interested in their accounts of the new country, and the new life to which they were going, he put farther and farther away the thought of his sins, and of thevrath of God which abideth on the ungodly. "The water is rising!" was the cry one morn- ing about sunrise, and as they all looked at the river they could easily perceive that it had risen a good deal during the night. There had been heavy rains back in the country, from which tributary streams had brought the waters to the Ohio. The river continued to rise until in two or three days it began to be covered with boats going up and down. They had now been out firom Pittsburgh about two weeks, but had still   A4 'T R MAISxY DAYS.     121 another week of floating before they could reach Cincinnati. They got along very slowly, because they were obliged to stop every night and fasten the boat until morning. One night, instead of going to the shore, they obtained permission to hitch their craft to a keel-boat, which was going to remain running slowly through the night. So instead of stopping, when the twilight came on, they were still out in the middle of the river, which was now growing wide and beautiful, looking at the moon and stars as they shone through the clear November air. They had built a good fire in the big cooking- stove, and piled their boxes to make a warm, sheltered- space around it, and then they fixed beds for the children, and wrapped themselves in blainkets and over-coats to keep out the cold and dampness. When the darkness set in, one after another lay down to rest until only a few were left awake. Tommy and his mother sat quite near together, with their backs against a large chest, looking out over tie river on the southern side. Through the darkness they could hear occasionally the shrill whistle of a steamboat, and see her flashing "   122     TOM MTTTAJER; OR, lights as she went swiftly by them, her wheels throwing up the foaming waters all around. It was a beautiful, as well as strange and solemn scene. Mrs. Miller felt its influence, though she could not have expressed it, unless some text of her only book, the Bible, had seemed to de- scribe it. Just then, however, thinking of all that had happened since the day when she left her home in Ireland, she was wondering over the provi- dences of God, and repeating to herself "He leadeth me by a way which I knew not of." She felt as if she were again going to a new world, more strange and trying than the other had been. Tommy was nearly asleep, and in fact only one or two of the men were awake, and they were sitting on the opposite side of their boat near where it was fastened to the keel-boat. Mr. Miller had laid down beside Katie, and both were fast asleep. It must have been ten o'clock when a strain of sweet, soft music floated out on the air, arousing Tommy from his doze. "What is that, mother? Where is it? Oh, I think it must be on the other boat,' and he turned to the opposite side to listen.   AFIPTERn MAWNY DAYS.     123 "It is a violin, mother; and 'hark! they are dancing. It is on the keel-boat. Oh mother, may I go and see them?" -No, Tommy, no indeed! Stay where you aire. You don't know what mischief they may be doing." Mrs. Miller, like most Protestant Irish, had a strong dislike to daincing, and even to light or trifling music. Dancing was in her eyes very sinful, and the sounds of mirth and revelry, which had so suddenly broken out on the other boat, made her very uneasy. ?. The stillness of the night had soothed her spirit into a sweet calmness and trust, a solemnity and reverence, upon which the noise grated harshy. As it increased she became more and more dis- turbed, and rising, walked backward and forward impatiently. She had been communing with God through the silent darkness which wrapped his works, and she felt as if the legions of Satan had suddenly invaded his presence. Though this would have been superstitious weakness in some, and perhaps Was so in her, she began to tremble for fear. An hour passed on, and still the revellers con-   124     TOM MLEIR; OR, tinued their amusement, growing constantly more noisy. They were evidently bent upon keeping up their sport until morning. Most of the persons upon. the flat-boat were too tired with their long journey, or too much occupied with other thoughts, to pay much atten- tion to it. Some of the younger ones, among whom were John Miller, and a young girl named Hetty Clark, to whom he-was going to be married when they arrived in St. Louis, went over to the other boat to look at the dancers, and would . probably have joined them had they been invited to do so. Poor Mrs. Miller's distress increased as the hour grew later, and there was no sign of their becoming more quiet. To add to it, she began to notice that the boat made more noise in passing through the water, and occasionally loud cracking sounds were heard from its timbers. The truth was they were passing into deeper water and a stronger current, which caused their boat to sway and crack as the waves struck it. She controlled her grief and fear as long as she could, but at last she had not a doubt that they were about to sink as a punishment for the sins   AFTER MANY DAYS.       125 of the revellers on the other boat, and began to cry and shriek aloud. "We shall surely die!" she screamed. "Oh Lord have mercy upon my husband and children! Have mercy upon all. Oh, spare them until they repent and turn to Thee!" Her husband was now awake, and tried in vain to quiet her. The wind was rising, the waves ran higher, the loud cracking of the boat increased. "It is a great sin to disturb the peace and holi- ness of the still night-God's night-in this way," she said, as they all anxiously gathered around her. She was a quiet, silent woman, scarcely ever speaking when not absolutely necessary, and her companions looked with amazement upon her agitation and excitement. "I tell you we shall all sink!" she repeated. "Don't you hear that crack? Judgment is com- ing upon them for their, ungodly doings, and we shall sink with them!" "No, no, Jane," Mr. Miller said, as kindly as he knew how, for even he was alarmed at this unusual state of feeling in his wife; "No, no, Jane, we'll 4 "   -   126     TOM MoIXJI EBR; OR, not go doon the night! It's only the wind and the deeper wather!" - But she would not be pacified or convinced that they were not in danger. "Oh, God, save them that know Thee not! Oh, make them turn to Thee, lest they be lost forever," she continued to cry out, moaning and weeping, while the sound of noisy revelry and profane oaths mingled strangely with her voice, and over all the midnight sty with its myriad stars looked down. All on board loved and respected Mrs. Miller, and one after another, the women broke out into sobs and tears, and the children waking, joined, until the men, overcome, some with pity, some with superstitious awe, and others still with real sorrow for their sins, at seeing this good woman so distressed for them, actually unfastened their ropes from the keel-boat, and with difficulty making their way to the shore, fastened their boat as usual to some stumps and logs. Soon all were quietly sleeping, while Mrs. Miller, thankful and relieved, allowed her husband and Katie to ar- range her bed for the night, and composed herself to rest also. To her the danger had been immi-   AFITER MANY DAYS.       127 nent, and she did not forget to thank God for their deliverance. And although there was not besides herself a Christian, at least a Protestant Christian, on board, no one thought of smiling or ridiculing her fears. The scene had been too solemn, and she evidently too earnest in her con- victions to be trifled with. Not a word was spoken the next morning in reference to the cause of their lying up for the night, but none of that little company ever forgot the thrilling reality of that midnight protest against sin. "We shall see Cincinnati to-day, John says," remarked Katie, as she hurried to put away their cooking utensils one morning, three or four days later. "Yes," said Tommy, "father told Mr. McDer- mot we should be ol land to-night, with good luck. Sha'n't you be glad, Katie?" "Yes, indeed, glad enough, I tell you. To tell the truth, Tom, .I've been more afraid since mother got so scared the other night, than I ever was before." "Mother used to say you were just as safe one place as another, and I suppose it's true," answered Thomas.   128     TOM MX4I ER; OR, "Yes, I suppose so," said Katie, thoughtfully. "I say, Tom, don't it seem very strange to you, if all is true that mother talks about, that there a'n't more Christians?" "I don't know as I ever thought about it, but it does seem so," said Thomas; "but it must be true, Katie." "If you think it's true, why don't you be a Christian, then?" said Katie. "For my part, I don't see how it is that everybody a'n't one, if they believe it." "Why a'n't you one then, Katie? You believe what mother says is in the Bible, don't you?" "Well, Tom, sometimes I think I believe it, but I don't know. I don't believe it as mother does. It is just as real to her as it is that we're going  st. Sometimes I do think," she con- tinued confidentially, seeing that -Tommy was really listening in earnest, c"sometimes I do think that I will pay attention to it, and that I won't rest till I've found out what religion really is. Did you ever feel so, Tom?" "No, I guess not," said Tommy, slowly. He did not like to deny it, nor could he tell his sister how he had felt during those two nights that he   A ?FTER MA35 oDAYS.     129 could never quite forget, though he tried very hard to do so. "Motler was talking to me last night," con- tinued Katie. "I used to turn it off, and think there wasn't nothing in it when she talked about such things. Ann used to say that nobody else could be like mother, religion or no religion, and we must all be our own selves; only not stealing, nor lying, of course. But I begin to believe it is the religion that makes mother different.", "I think it is too," said Tommy. He and Katie had drawn nearer together during the days of this long journey, and he spoke more freely to her than he once would have done. "I suppose we all ought to be Christians, Katie, I really do; but some way. I can't see just how." "Mother says if we see our sins and are sorry for them, and believe God will punish sin, that then there is nothing to do but to give up all to Jesus, and ask forgiveness for his sake. That is what she said last night. But I don't see, Tom, as I have been very wicked;-I never stole, nor told a lie, nor disobeyed mother, though to be sure I would not go to Sunday-school, for I thought I was too old; but I don't feel as if God   130     'TOMV ViTT T ,E', . would punish me very much; and I can't feel very sorry for what I've done!" Tommy felt that he could explain to her from his own experience what it was to be and to feel one's self a sinner, but he did not want to revive those old guilty feelings, so he only said, "I don't think you are very bad, Katie; you've always been a pretty good girl. I wouldn't think any more about it." But he felt guilty all day that he had not only refused to come himself to the Saviour, but had helped to keep his sister back when she was groping for the light. "There's Cincinnati," shouted Samuel, "we shall be there-in less than an hour!"   VIII. A RI3 V1ED AT ST. LOUIS. "The Lord is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy; He hath not dealt with us after our sins; Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities." OATS were freely running on the river before our emigrants arrived at Cincinnati, and the party found no difficulty in securing passage to St. Louis on reasonable terms. Although most of the men travelling with the Millers intended to become farmers in Illinois, it was thought best that they should all 'go to St. Louis, the largest city in that region, and from thence go out to look for farms of the fertile prairie land, of which thousands of acres yet lay unsettled and wild. They sold the flat-boat at Cincinnati for forty dollars. Thus it had cost the ten families only one hundred dollars besides their provisions, to travel from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati. 131   132    rOMj  MTTTAR; OR, "The name of our steamboat is the 'Tributary,"' said Thomas, running up to his mother and sister, late in the afternoon; "we can go on board to- night, and start early in the morning!" This was welcome news. They were getting tired, and very anxious to finish the journey. But all the hardships were not over yet. Going from Cincinnati to St. Louis on the "Tributary" was a hard trip in more senses than one. The captain was a cruel, wicked, violent man, and his crew were also very quarrelsome and profane. Every day there was some new scene of wrangling and violence among them, and the most horrible oaths were always sounding in the ears of the passen- gers. The boat was over-crowded, and the emi- grants had very little chance for retirement. The women and girls of the party we have been fol- lowing were all neat, cleanly, and respectable, and they suffered much from the filth and noise, while they were shocked and frightened by the frequent dangerous quarrels. The cabin passengers were not so much annoyed and pained by these things, for they could retire to their state-rooms or to the saloons, but these emigrants never saw the beautiful interior of   AFTER MANY DAYS.         133 that part of the boat. They were only deck-pas- sengers. However, they were going much faster than they had been, which was one comfort. In a few days they were nearing the mouth of the Ohio, where it joins the great Mississippi. But just before they arrived at Cairo, an incident occurred which again set Thomas thinking of his eternal interests. As they were running rapidly along, one clear, frosty morning, they saw just before them a flat- boat, like the one they had left at Cincinnati. The captain saw it, as did some of the crew, but they recklessly ran on, leaving the flat-boat to get out of the way as it could. Its crew did their best, and nearly succeeded in escaping a collision, but the steamboat struck one end of it, and dam- aged it quite seriously, although it was in no danger of sinking. The men on the flat-boat, seeing that the steamboat had not tried to avoid running upon them, were furious with rage. In a moment a scene of tumult and angry contention began. The crew of the flat-boat shouted out loud and angry curses, and the most horrible wishes as to the fate of the steamboat. The 12   134     TOM MILISIf; OR, emigrants, in frightened groups, stood upon the deck, while the captain of the "Tributary," on the upper deck, loudly returned their oaths and execrations. The quarrel grew more violent and furious, until at last the captain, drawing his pistol, fired directly at one of the men on the flat-boat. In- furiated at this, they instantly returned the fire, from guns and pistols, and for a short time the shots were rapidly exchanged. Tommy was standing beside his mother watch- ing the flat-boat, when a bullet came whistling through the air close by his head, so close that his hair was singed as it passed over, and buried itself in a heavy box behind them! Pale and almost fainting with fright, he could only stand still until the two boats had got so far apart that they could no longer carry on the quarrel. Fortunately no one on board the "Trib- utary" was killed or injured.. One of the men on the flat-boat had fallen on the captain's first fire; whether dead, or wounded, they never knew. Death had never been quite so near to Tommy Miller before. He now realized that had he been half an inch taller, or the range of the bullet   AJFTER MANY DAYS.      135 half an inch lower, he would have been instantly killed! Had they stood a foot farther to the right, it would have struck his mother's head, and killed her! Could they call it chance that they had escaped? Had he been taken, where would his soul have gone? Had not God been very good, not only to spare him, but to leave him his mother also, who was prepared for death? All these and many other thoughts passed through his mind during the day. Mrs. Miller, seeing him so thoughtful, had not spoken of the event since her first joyful words of thanksgiving when she found he was unhurt. She thought perhaps it was best to leave him with his own thoughts and feelings, trusting and praying that God's Holy Spirit would im- press the lesson upon his heart. Towards night, as they stood together looking out over the broad river, first at one shore, then at the other, and then on ahead where they could almost see the two great rivers uniting their waters, she said softly, "Thomas, don't you think you ought to thank God for saving your life?" "Yes, mother, I have thanked him."   136     TOM  ILIlERt; OR, "If that bullet had passed a very little lower, you would now have been lying dead. And where would your soul have been?" "I don't know, mother." "Have you any reason to think it would 'have been with God in heaven?" "No,-I don't suppose I have." "Then it must have been sent to punishment. Oh, Tommy, although you are such a great sin- ner in His sight, and thbugh you have seen your sins to be hateful and grievous to Him, and yet will not ask Jesus to be your Saviour; in spite of all this, he has given you one more opportunity of coming to Him. Dare you refuse?  Woh't you come to Jesus withLyour sins, and give your- self up into his hands?" "Mother, what makes you always talk as if I was such a great sinner?" said Tommy, a little impatiently. "I a'n't near so bad as some boys are. I know I used to stay away from Sunday- school to play, and I don't always mind, but if you could see the way some boys do, you'd think I was good." "All sins, even what you would perhaps call little ones, are alike in God's sight. And even if   AFTE]R MANY DA-YS.      137 we could not see anything wrong in your outward acts, your heart might still be full of evil purposes and motives." "Don't you think I am a better boy than I was before we left Philadelphia, mother?" "I think he is,-a great deal better!" said Katie, who had come up just in time to hear the question. "He don't run away, and he hardly ever swears, and he has been kind to you and me, mothet, 'most all the time since we started." "And I haven't been saucy to father, nor diso- beyed him hardly once since we started, either," said Tommy. "Mother/you ought to praise me when I do improve." "I am very glad you have done so well, lately," said Mrs. Miller, "but then don't you think that circumstances have something to do with that? You have not had so many temptations to do wrong; you have had something to interest you nearly all the time, and you have not been told to do anything that you did not want to do, very often." "You don't give me as much praise as father does,' muttered Tommy; "he says I am getting to be a fine, manly boy, and will be a great help - 12 -   138     TOM M LLI ER; OR, to him very soon. You don't give me any credit when I do try to be good." Thomas spoke bitterly; half angrily, for to tell the truth, he knew it was just as his mother said. But he felt so badly when he thought about his sins, that he was determined not to look at them, and had spent the afternoon trying to persuade himself that he was not so very bad, after all. He was fast becoming successful in this self-de- ception, for as the old adage says, "none are so blind as those that will not see!" "Children," said Mrs. Miller, "when you do those things for which you think you ought to be praised, or when you keep from doing things which are wrong, is it because you wish to serve God?" Katie spoke first. "Because I want to be good."  "Why do you want to be good?" "So that you will be pleased with us," said Tommy, "and so that we will not feel guilty, nor be blamed, or scolded." "It is better for everybody to be good," said Katie, "they get along better, they ale better liked, and they will go to heaven when they die.   AFT3ER rMANY DAxYS.     139 }'m sure there is reason enough why we should want to be good." "Do you think you can be good enough to be sure of going to heaven when you die?" "Some folks are," said Katie. "I think you expect to go to heaven, mother, and I am sure you ought to, for you are always good." "Katie, if I ever get to heaven, it will not be on account of any goodness in me, but because I trust in Jesus, and God has pardoned me for His sake. I try to obey Jesus because I love him, not because I expect to deserve heaven by doing good." "But, mother," said Katie, "I can't understand how it is you think we are so wicked. I don't feel as if I do anything so very bad." "Not so very, bad in the sight of men, perhaps, but 'God looketh on the heart.' He has com- manded us to love Him first and above all else. If we do not do this, we are sinners in His sight, though for worldly or selfish motives we may do right in the sight of men." Tommy remembered, though he was always try- ing to forget it, how plainly he had seen all this long ago, and how near he had been to God's   "O     TOIM VrTT.,T,T-R; OR, presence on that terrible night when he first saw his sins. He would not think of it now. His heart was not ready to yield to Jesus, and yet he saw that there was no other way. So because he was not willing to yield, he. had begun to talk and think to himself many things he did not really believe, and try to convince himself that they were true. This kind of self-deceit is very common when a sinner has become convicted and knows the way, but will not give up. He "will not have this man to rule over" him. Many an avowed skeptic stands just on this ground. As for Katie, she was sincere im saying that she did not see herself a sinner. She was not guilty of any gross misconduct, was a cheerful, healthy, active girl, not sensitive and not ill- natured, and had always been called a good girl by her employers. During this journey she had been a good deal with her mother, and had been led to think more about religion than ever before. But she did not see the necessity of repentance, or the need of a Saviour. Mrs. Miller scarcely saw her husband, or the two elder sons John and Samuel, except at their meals. She could only pray fort them, but she   wAFTER MANY DAAYS.     141 never forgot to do that. She was getting very anxious to have a home again. It seemed so long since they had started on this journey. It was now December, and although they had been going southward for many days, and the weather was iot much colder than it had been two months before; it was rainy and unpleasant, and her health was very poor. The exposure ever since they started had been very great and dangerous for one no stronger than she was, and she felt as if God had been especially merciful in preserving her from severe sickness or death. They were now going up the Mississippi river, and expected to reach St. Louis in a very few days. "Can't we stay in St. Louis for the winter, father?" said John, on the last day as they were rapidly nearing the city. "It is too late to hunt lands, Jim Roorke says." "And even if we got a place, mother isn't well enough to go out on the prairies this cold weather," said Katie. "She'd die of cold in one of them houses made of logs, they tell about." "I s'pose we could stan' it as well 's other folks," grumbled Mr. Miller, who never would   believe his wife was not as strong as anybody, "but I've bin thinkin' we might as well stay in the city, that is if we can git onything to do there. We must all go to worruk; for our money, what there is left, must all bie saved to buy the ,farrum." They reached St. Louis at last, having been- more than two months on the way. We could make the same journey now in about forty-eight hours. I cannot begin to tell you how glad and thankfill Mrs. Miller felt at the prospect of hav- ing a home again, even for a few months. It was the day after Christmas when they landed, and they found some people from Phila- delphia, whom they knew, and went home with them to stay until a house could be found. And here, at last, the mother found a little rest, and began to recover from the fatigue of her long journey. It was several days before a house of the kind Mr. Miller thought they could afford, was found. Meantime he had hired out to "break rocks" on the road, John and Samuel had found work about the warehouses, and Katie went out to service.   During the first week in January Mr. Miller came home one night with the news that he had secured a house and they could move right away. "Where is it, father?" asked Tommy, who had been exploring the city, and began to feel that he knew all the localities. "In Cincinnati row," said Mr. Miller. "They are all frame houses, and you must be careful not to set anything afire. They a'n't like Filadelfy bricks." It would have done your heart good to look in a week later at Mrs. Miller's little home. She was one of those women whom we meet some- times among the rich, sometimes among even the very poor, who would make a cheerful home anywhere. The house was very small; they had bought just as little furniture as possible, and that was of the rudest kind. Butd after all, as Mr. and Mrs. Miller and Tommy sat around the little pine table after supper in the evening, with a tallow candle in one of the shining brass candle- sticks she had brought from the old home, and a cheerful fire in the clean, though broken stove;   "4     TOM M ILLTE; OIL, the floor scoured so white you would never think of a carpet, and the green paper curtain; let down before the windows, it was a pleasant, home-like picture. There was no neat bed-room opening from it like the one at the old home. Only a closet in which their dishes could be kept, and if you went tip the little winding stairs in one corner, one more room, with two clean beds, with a box at the head of each, and nothing more. They had all begun to feel that it was home, humble as it was.  That indescribable charm which a neat, thrifty, loving wife and mother spreads over all around her, was as visible and perceptible there as it would have been in a cost- lier dwelling. And that is what creates the feel- ing of satisfied regard for a lowly home more often than anything else. Some poor women would have thought that because they had so little furniture, and so poor a house, and were to stay so short a time, they might be excused for untidiness and careless housekeeping. Not so Mrs. Miller. She was just as methodical and neat in all her work, as she expected to be if they ever lived in that large, beautiful farm-   AFTER, M ANIY D-A3YS-.    145 house, surrounded by flocks of sheep and cows, and fields of waving grain and orchards, which her husband sometimes talked about when in unusual good humor. 13   IX. PAT DEGAN'S GROC ERY. "Drink!" said the Demon, " drink your fill,- 'Twill fill your homes with care and grief, And clothe your back with tatters; 'Twill fill your heart with evil thoughts, But never mind! What matters?" "f T'S time that boy had something to do!" I  said Mr. Miller one night at the supper- table, as Tomnmy hurriedly ate his meal, annd' then rushed again into the street where he had spent the afternoon.   X "That's tiru  for ye, father," said Samuel, "he's gettin' too fond o' the street, and he 'll be goin' back this old tricks again." "Now John's got married an' got a wife to support, I must count on you two for help," con- tinued Mr. Miller. "I must find something for Tom to do right away." "6   AXFTER MANYr DAYS.      147 "I wish Tommy could go to school this win- ter," ventured his mother. , "He's too old for schoolin', an' never got no good o' what he's had," said his father. "I sha'n't send him no more." "It will be his last chance," urged Mrs. Mil- ler, "there won't likely be any school out on the prairie; he's older now, and will heed better." Ic tell you there's no use of talkin' of schoolin' for him this winter," said her husband, "if he can aim onything he's got to do it, even if 'ta'n't much. He must make a beginning and waste no more time." i "Pat Degan wants a boy in his grocery," said Samuel. "I've heard tell 'twas as good for a boy in a store as goin' to school. They have to use 'rithmetic, you know." "Yes, an' they get pay instead so' losin' their time," said Mr. Miller. "I 'll takl Tom 'round to-night an' see if he will do.", And he went out to hunt up the bby. ,   ) Pat Degan's grocery was really a whisky shop. There was, to be sure, a counter for  e of sugar, candles and such things, but the bar on the other side attracted the most of the custom-   "O    TOM MiIIILLER; OR, ers. Even Mr. Miiller would have hesitated about placing a son in such a situation and under such influences, had not his judgment been blinded by the pro0spect of the money lie would receive. There were very few things that a boy of his age, ignorant as he was, could earn wages at. It did not take long to reach' the place. Tommy had been there once or twice on errands for his mother, and when his father explained to him now the object of their present visit, he felt pleased at the idea of tending grocery, and hoped Patrick Degan would take him. The grocery stood on Broad Street, between Morgan and Cherry Streets. It was a low, one- story, wooden building, standing with the end to the street, with six high steps to mount before you could enter the door. On one side of the door as you went in was the " grocery" counter, and on the other 'the whisky bar. It was not hard to see from the character of the custom- ers, which one of these they had come to patron- ize. In the middle of the -room was a large, round stove, with just enough room to pass on each side of it. There was another room back of   'a Jt '.lt V-t..-.I . J- ..V JL .A.. ./  this into which they saw several of the men go, and which Thomas afterwards learned more about. Pat "Degan was a little surprised to see Mr. Miller. He had never been there before in the evening. He had no taste for that kind of amusement, and was too fond of his money to waste it in that way. Perhaps had he really known the scenes that were enacted in that place almost ever'y night, and the bad company with which his son must associate, he would have hesitated about placing Tommy there, even for wages. ," Samuel Miller, my son, says you're wantin' a boy," he said, going up to Degan, who had slipped around to the grocery side of his store. "I've brought my Tom around tp see if he 'll do for ye." Thomas was a bright looking boy, with clear honest-looking eyes, and always kept clean and neat by his mother's care. BDegan was pleased with the prosDect of getting him to wait on his customers, but he was as fond of money as Mr. Miller, and looked at the boy some time without speaking. 13 -   50     TOM MLLER; OR,  "I'm ruther afraid he's too small for me," he said. "I'd thought of a big boy or a young man to help." " If his size is your throuble," said one of the men, who was smoking by the stove, " he's get- tin' better o' that every day." "That's thrue for yees 1" said another.  He's a loikely lad, to be sure." After pretending to hesitate for some time, Patrick Degan finally made a bargain for Thomas to work in his store, and board and sleep at home. He was to receive as his pay the sum of three dollars and fifty cents a month. "When he larns the business, he '11 git more wages, ov coorse," he said, "but at first he won't be much help to me." Mr. Miller was, on the whole, satisfied. He had not expected that Tommy would earn much, but he wanted a beginning made. So the next morning the boy entered on his new duties as bar-tender and clerk for Pat Degan. This was very painful to his mother, who had Been hoping to get him into school for the rest of the winter. But she had to submit. She had long ago learned that it was of no use to say any-   AFiTER MA-NY DAYS.      IuI thing in opposition to any plan when it was once determined upon by her husband. She was thankful that Thomas was to board and sleep at home, so that she could see how he was getting on every day.  During the day Thomas frequently wondered why Patrick Degan had wanted a boy, when there was so little to do. There were not more than half-a-dozen customers all the morning, and the few cents' worth of tea or sugar, molasses or flour, which they wanted was soon given them. About one o'clock quite a crowd of men came in for a drink before going to their afternoon's work, and kept them both lively for a little while. After that the afternoon was as dull as the morn- ing. But when he went back to the store in the evening there was a change. Half-a-dozen men were smoking in a row on the grocery counter, and others kept coming in, some only for a drink and out again, some to remain with the company there. By-and-by three men came in and stop- ping at the bar for whisky, passed into the back room. Patrick Dcgan was a bachelor who made the store his home, and had his bed in one corner of this other room. In the middle of the apart-   152    rTOM MTTTEItER; OR, ment stood a heavy table at which these men sat down and began to play cards. Tommy had seen cards in the hands of other boys in Phila- delphia, and had learned some games with them when playing out in the afternoons. But he had always been kept in so strictly in the evenings, that he had little idea of the extent to which gambling was practised. As one after another went into the back room, and the table was filled up with players, they began to call for liquor, which Degan sent in by Thomas. He soon be- came a favorite in both rooms, and was noticed " and flattered by all the men until he began to feel quite important. Ten o'clock, eleven o'clock came, and still the store was full -of men, .who had now become noisy in both apartments. It was a new sight for Thomas Miller. Eight or ten men were sitting around the table in the back-room quarreling over their cards, and accusing each other of "chating," already so drunk as to be unable to sit straight, yet calling frequently for more whisky. In the front-room as many more were loudly debating political questions with oaths and fist- shakings, stopping to take another drink after   AFTER IMVANY' DAYS.     153 each harangue. Towards midnight some began to get stupid and sink down in drunken slumbers on the floor or counter. These Pat Degan would lead to the door and push out without farther ceremony. About twelve o'clock the front room was nearly empty, those who could" still walk having received strong hints to leave, and those who could not being summarily turned out to get away as they could. Thomas now received per- mission to go home, and Degan himself retired to the back-room to join the five or six who still remained there. Thus ended Todmmy Miller's first day at his new business. You will be surprised when I tell you that he was rather disposed to. like it, on the whole. He had been a little frightened at the rough conduct and awful profanity, and somewhat disgusted at the sight of the drunken men, but after all there was an excitement and interest about it which he relished. In fact, Tommy's character was fast losing the smoothness and thoughtfulness it had gained during the journey. It had taken another direction now, and instead of being infatuated with boyish sports, he was desirous of being considered a man. It was something like the importance he   154     TOM ITT[TTPtR; OR, craved, to be treated with so much attention and flattery, coarse as it was, at the grocery. Still it seems hardly possible that a boy taught as Thomas had been by a Christian mother, and who had at different times been so deeply im- pressed with the truths of religion as to feel him- self a sinner, and tremble at thoughts of the judgments of God, could forget it all and plunge into scenes of sin and folly with a relish. We must not forget that Thomas had chosen to re- main a stranger to the Saviour. He had been for several weeks trying to drive away serious thoughts, being unwilling to give up all to be- come a Christian. And there is no deception so easy as self-deception. The depraved heart is always ready to believe a lie," and be quieted with sophistries. Tommy was now willing, yes %nxious, to do anything, say anything, go any- where that would help to stifle his conscience, and conceal from himself his wickedness in reject- ing Jesus. Mrs. Miller would lhave sat up for him that night had her husband allowed her to do so. But he had ordered her to go to bed, saying he would let the boy in when he came. He knew it   AFTEJX  vIrANY  DA YS.  155 would -be late, but did not know how late it really was when his wife waked him saying that Tommy was at the door. She had not slept. Mr. Miller did not like the idea of getting up regularly at midnight to let Thomas in, and began to think perhaps he had better not let him stay. But at breakfast time/when Tommy handed him the three dollars ant a-half in advance for his month's wages, and sad, "Mr. Degn thinks I had better- stay in the store at nights, after this, father; it is so late when we get through," the sight of the money made him forget his doubts as to its being a good place for his son, and he replied, "Yes, I think so too.- If he has got a bed for you there, you'd better stay than be runnin' through the streets afther it's- so late." ' It was twelve o'clock when Tommy came in last night," said his mother, turning round from the stove where she was taking up the breakfast. "Oh, now, ye're tellin' it too strong," said Mr. Miller, "I don't belave it was past tin, or may be half-past tin; there's no clock in the house, so how could ye know?" I heard a clock strike," she replied.   156    TOM: MLLER; OR, "Ye coonted wrong, thin, that's all. I'd but jist shut me eyes to slape, an' it couldn't be late." Tommy knew his mother was right, but he did not say so. And much against her wishes it was settled that he should sleep at the grocery in future. The scenes of that first evening at Pat Degan's were repeated on each succeeding one, until Thomas became quite accustomed to them. I cannot, I would not if I could, tell you the many wicked things he saw and heard during all the time he remained there. The worst of it is, he not only saw and heard, he was learning to participate. Not that he ever got drunk or gam- bled for money. He had no taste for whisky and had no time or money for the other. But he was, learning to feel perfectly at ease amid these things, and to laugh as heartily at their jests and wicked stories as any of them. Every week he staid there he grew better acquainted with all the forms of vice and iniquity that cluster around a low grog-shop, and more forgetful of the pure lessons of his mother and Sunday-school teacher. How much of this did his mother see and know?   A AFTER. MATXANY DAYS.   157 She suspected and feared a great deal, though I suppose her ideas of the place where Tommy spent his time were, nothing like as bad as the facts. Tommy was at home but very little; only to his meals and back again as soon as possible; and she had little opportunity to talklwith him 'on any subject. He was not unkind to her, but he managed to give her no chance to talk to him alone. His Sundays were spent in sleeping until noon or after, and then going out with other boys until bed-time. One Saturday night he was at his place at the whisky bar as usual. Saturday was their busiest' evening, and the store was crowded with men With their week's wages- in their pockets, the greater part of which would be in Pat Degan's money-drawer before morning. One group after another retired to the back- room, chinking their money, and challenging each other to a game of " folty-fives," which seemed to be the favorite among Irishmen there. Some of the men however did not leave the bar-room. They seemed to prefer whisky alone to whisky and gambling combined. Two of these, Dennis Toole and Jim O'Brien "   appeared to have some old grudge against each other. They both drank deeply and often, and the more they drank the faster they talked, and the more anxious did they seem to become to find some occasion for quarreling. Whatever one said was sure to be picked up and found fault with by the other. Tommy was very much amused    ! at their drunken confabs, and listened to the  rising altercation as after each drink it became  more furious and noisy. "Have another drink, Jim," said one of the other men, going up to the bar where Tommy stood mixing the beverages called for. "No-guess not," said Jim, with a ludicrous, drunken attempt at dignity. "I've had 'nuff for t' night. Mustn't take too much, or I'll be droonk!" "'It's afraid of his quarthers he is," said Den- nis, "he'd. be expicted to trate, belike; Jim O'Brien's niver too droonk to be stingy!" "Ye blatherin spalpeen ye!" said Jim, indig- nantly, reeling round towards him, "sure ye know there's no mon so free wi' his money as Jim O'Brien! Didn't I jist give five dollars to   Father Ohone for the new church this blissid day? "An' the more fool ye are!" retorted the other, wastin yer airnin's that way, 'f I 'as fool 'nuff to give me money to a thavin, desateful 6praste, I'd kape the fact t"mesilf!" "Ye protistant thafe o'the worruld!" shouted Jim, "is it that way that ye insolt the Holy Mither Church, and a thrue son o' the church, like mesel! and Father Ohone? Ye contimptable, heretic blackguard, that's what ye are!" "Ye poor, degraded Catholic!" responded Dennis, "ye knows no better nor belavin' all the desavin' worruds of the snakin, whinin' prastes like Father Ohone!  Didn't he take the last fufty sints old Judy McCone had, pratindin 'twas for the church, an' she starvin' on her bed? 'f he's a thrue sod of the Holy Mither Church, bad luck I say to sooch a mither, an' all her brats!" "Och, murther and Purgatory!  Hear the heretic talk! Take that for yees-an' that-and that!" And the two drunken disputants began a fist- fight, the blows soon tumbling them both upon the floor, where they rolled, and clinched, and   160    TTOM MVIILVER ; OR, swore at each other until, Pat Degan happening to open the door, coming in with some fresh cards, just as Dennis was trying to rise, that worthy rolled out of it, down the six steps into the gutter, and was seen no more. Jim, finding himself too drunk to regain his feet, lay muttering and curs- ing his adversary, until Tommy, tired of his pro- fane language and beastly appearance, again opened the door and applying his foot vigorously to the prostrate man, rolled him also down the steps into the street. And this was not an un- common way of disposing of troublesome cus- tomers at Pat Degan's grocery. When their money was gone, or they were too drunk to be longer profitable, or when, as (now, they grew quarrelsome -and uproarious, Pat or Tommy quietly rolled them out, and the six high steps made it quite impossible for them to get in again that night. One would not suppose they would be foolish enough to go again, where they had been thus treated, but I have been told that it made no difference. They loved whisky too well to let any little personal feelings stand in the way of their devotion and worship at his shrine! What a pity that in the cause of Temperance,   AF'TEtR iMANY DA YS.     161 and even Religion, we do not always see a like devotion! Well, this was the sort of scenes with which Tommy Miller was getting familiar. This was the way in which his evenings were spent. And when after clearing out and locking up the front- room of the grocery about twelve o'clock, he retired to the bed in the corner of the other room, which he shared with the proprietor, his' sleep was disturbed for an hour or two longer by the profane and angry ejaculations of the group around the- card-table. Sometimes he started up in affright as they grew violent and knives would flash, o' blows resound through the room. About two o'clock Pat Degan would let out the last of them, put out the light and come to bed. And thus the days and weeks went by, and the time when he thought about becoming a Christian was almost forgotten by Tommy. What would Mr. Rushton have thought to see him thus? If he had been nearly discouraged in the days of his comparative innocence, he would surely have given the boy up now. But there was One, long- suffering and slow to anger, who did see all. He watched over his daily acts and words. He saw ^ 14    162     TOM MXILLER; OR, all the vileness and iniquity of that low drink- ing-shop, all the hardness and depravity of the young heart which turned away from his mother's pure teachings, from the Holy Spirit's pleadings, and the Saviour's outstretched arms, and chose- this. It is a solemn thought that when we forget and neglect God, He does not forget us. He is ever watching us, day by day, and the recording angel is writing down in that great book out of which we must be judged, all our thoughts, our words, our actions. You too, my reader, if you are trying to put away your serious im- pressions and turn again to sin and folly, He is watching. He sees you now, just as clearly as lie saw you when on your knees before Him you were almost a Christian, but alas, arose in your own strength, not Christ's, and so fell in the next day's battle. Tommy had to rise early while his employer slept, and sweep the grocery, put everything in order after th4 last night's rioting, and prepare for their few day customers. One of his early duties was to flean the lamp which hung from the ceiling by a chain, and fill it with oil for the next evening's use. This lamp was a large   AF'TE3R MANY DAYS.     163 one, and Pat Degan was very proud of it, as the one handsome article in his place. When Tommy had been there about three months he was cleaning this lamp one morning, after having been up later than usual the night before, and in turning to get the oil-can he knocked it off the counter to the floor where it was shivered to fragments. Pat Degan was a very violent man, although he had never yet found occasion to wreak his wrath very severely upon Tommy. Now how- ever the boy knew he was in bad humor, having lost money at the gambling-table the night be- fore, and he did not like the idea of braving the consequences when he should come in and find the lamp broken. Tommy's resolution was' quickly taken. He knew that Degan owed him money for nearly a month's services. He might keep that for the value of the lamp, and he would go before he was up, and not return. So he put on his hat, went home to breakfast half an hour earlier than usual, and told his parents that he had left Pat Degan.  His father was satisfied when Tommy assured him that with his present   164!     TOM MLTILER. experience he could get higher wages elsewhere, and his mother was glad to have him leave the grocery on any terms, trusting that his next employment would be more respectable.   X. vA Nj E3W SITUATION. FEELING the want of sleep the next morn- ing, after the late hours of the three or four pights just past, Thomas thought he would go up stairs and lie down an hour or two after breakfast before going out to find a new situation. His father and Samuel left for their work, and the house was very quiet. It had been a long time since he had spent an hour at home. He had eaten his meals there, it is true, but he had eaten as rapidly as he could and hurried off again. His mother said very little to him this morning, but her eyes followed his every movement with that wistful tenderness he knew so well, and he went up-stairs partly to escape orom them. Thomas had tried to avoid his mother for a long time. Even ler face and presence reminded him of things he was trying to forget. He had not been 165   166     TOM RMTTET,RR; OR, in his old room up-stairs since he went to Pat Degan's to sleep. How long it seemed. He seemed to himself to be years older than he was the last time he lay upon that bed. And yet it was only a few short weeks. Just as he was lying down, after taking off his coat, he noticed a little gilt frame hanging over the head of his bed. He got up to examine it, for he had not seen it before. Within the frame was the little orna- mented card with a hymn upon' it which Gertie Rushton gave him when he left Philadelphia. He knew that his mother must have bought the frame, and hung it there. With a feeling he could not have defined, he took it down and began to read the hymn:- "Holy Bible, book divine! Precious treasure, thou art mine." "I wonder where my Bible is?" thought Thomas, "Mother's got it safe, I suppose, though ;" and he read on,- "Mine to tell me whence I came; Mine to teach me what I am. Mine to chide me when I rove, Mine to show a Father's love;   AFITERI MANY DAYS.        167 "Love," thought Tommy, "love? yes; and after roving, too. I should think it would be 'a Father's anger' after that." "Mine to guide my doubtful feet, Mine to judge, condemn, acquit." Acquit-acquit-" thought he, " oh yes, that means not to blame, to let any one go free from a charge of doing something wrong.   Ben Brown was acquitted when they tried him for stealing Tom  Little's pocket-book; and they found out afterwards it was Larry Smith did it.   But I didn't know the Bible would acquit. I thought it always blamed folks." "Mine to comfort in distress; Mine to cheer, sustain and bless; Mine to-show by living faith Man can triumph over death. "Mine to tell of joys to come, And the rebel sinner's doom-" "That is the reason you stopped reading yours ;" conscience whispered to Tommy,- "Oh, thou precious Book divinb, Holy Bible, thou art mine!"   168     TOM: ISTTIT ER,; OR, ' I wonder if anybody does feel that way about the Bible!" said Tommy to himself. I believe mother does." The card had set Tommy thinking.   And there alone, with the sweet home influences silently at work around him, all taking shape from the loving heart and patient faith of the mother whose gentle steps he heard below, it was not so easy to stifle thought as it was in the ncsy grocery. Still he did not go very far down into his rebellious Lheart. It was stirred only a little on the surface, that was all. I believe I'll try and find a place in a grocery where they don't sell whisky by the drink," he said to himself, and then losing consciousness in sleep he drifted off into dream-land. He did not forget this resolution when he awoke. He knew of a man named Kennedy, who kept a grocery, but did not sell "by the drink" or lep a gambling-table. He had heard some days before that he wanted a boy. So about eleven o'clock he went around to this place. Ken- nedy had just turned away a boy he had had three or four days. "Re wa'n't spry enough," he said, looking sharply at Tommy.   AF ITER M3A NY DAYS.     169 "Come from Degan's, have. ye?" he went on, when Thomas had told his story. "It's a low, nasty place; but I've heerd 'em say you was a right smart boy; I guess I'll try ye. What pay did he give ye?' "(I want five dollars a month," said the boy. "Five dollars! Well, I'll give it to ye, if yer worth anything, an' if ye a'n't, I won't have ye at any price. Pat Degan never give ye that, though." "When shall I come, Mr. Kennedy?" "This afternoon airly. Yer work 'll be in the day-time here, d'ye understand? Weighin' out sugar or drawin' molasses, and whisky by the quart, and puttin' up tea-'n' coffee and so on. I hope ye know ye 've got to a respectable place now! "Mother will be glad, won't she though?" said Tommy to himself as he walked home to dinner. And somehow the thought of-pleasing his mother gave him purer satisfaction than he had felt in anything for a lng time. His mother was glad. Though she had never known of the dreadful scenes enacted at Degan's every night, still the' knowledge that he sold 15   170    nTOM MILLER; OR, liquor and kept a gaming-table had made her sure it was no place for Tommy. As for Mr. Miller, the enlarged wages made all right in his eyes, and though he scolded some over the broken lamp, he became calmer on reflection that without this accident the change of places would probably not have occurred, Kennedy's was a much more respectable place than Pat Degan's, and Mr. Miller had always a desire for "respectability," however hard he might have found it to give a clear idea of his understanding of that word. Tommy entered upon his new situation that afternoon at two o'clock. Pat Degan, knowing that the wages due Thomas were abundant recompense for the lamp, and finding he had really gone to another place, said nothing about the matter. Two or three weeks went by, and nothing of note occurred in Tommy's life at the grocery. He was sufficiently smart and spry to satisfy even Mr. Kennedy's ideas. For now that he had turned his attention to business instead of play, fThomas Miller was not by any means lazy or idle. On the contrary he was becoming very ambitious of the reputation of a hard-working,   AFTER MANY DAYS.      171 industrious boy, and so suited his presents em- ployer very well. iV[r. Kennedy did not keep open late at night, nor did he have men lounging in his place beyond bed-time. But his own evenings were spent away from the store almost always. He fre- quently did not return until very late. Tommy never knew where his time was spent, whether simply in social pleasures, or around one of those gaming tables which he himself was too " respect- able" to keep. But as it was very lonely stay- ing at the store by himself, Tommy often got a friend to spend the night with him. He had now a good many friends, or at least acquaint- ances, with whom he was nearly, if not quite, as popular as he had been with the boys in Phila- delphia. John Grant, his most in timate associ- ate, was a wild and reckless, though not known as a positively vicious, or dishonest, youth. Mr. Kennedy did not find fault when he came home and found that his clerk had company, but went to his own bed in the otler corner of the room. So it came to be a common thing for John to stay there at night. "Have you been to the money-drawer this   172     TOM MLLERZ; OR, morning, Tom?" said his employer one morning after he had come home late the night before. "Yes, sir," promptly replied Thomas, "twice." "To take out or to put in money?" "I took a picayune out for the ice-man, and I put in two bits I took for some sugar." Is that all?" "Yes, sir, that is all." Mr. Kennedy said no more, but acted particu- larly cross and suspicious all the morning, and Thomas began to feel very uncomfortable. He wanted to ask his employer what he meant by those questions, but he did not dare. At last, just before he went to dinner, he said, "What made you ask about the money- drawer, Mr. Kennedy?" "What's that to you, if you don't know nothing about it?" quickly returned the man. "Well, I would like to know; you seemed worried about something," said Tommy. "What's that John Grant a-stayin' round here o' nights for?" said Kennedy. "I never told you nor him he could stay." "You never seemed to care, and I got so lone-   A:FTER MANY DAYS.      173 some when you were out," said Tommy, thinking it strange that after allowing, it for ,two months, lie should object now. "I don't want no loafers hangin' 'round here nights," said Kennedy, "nor I won't have 'em, neither." "Well," said Thomas, "I would'n't have asked John if I'd s'posed you'd care; but you never seemed to object. But what is it about the drawer?" I'm near five dollars short o' my reckonin'," said Kennedy, looking Thomas in the face. "You certainly don't think - I stole your money," said the boy. "I don't know anything about it, Mr. Kennedy." "Perhaps it was done when you was asleep," suggested Kennedy, still watching his face very closely. "By John, do you 'mean? Why you know you carry the key yourself at night."  "There could be other keys." "Mr. Kennedy, do yo: mean to say you think that I or John stole that money?" 'No, I don't mean to accuse nobody, nor I don't; you asked about it yourself. Go home to 15 :   174     TOM MLLERl; OR, your dinner, and don't say no more about it, unless I do." Tommy went away only half satisfied. A day or two passed and Kennedy still acted surly and constrained, though he made no farther reference to the missing money. InJfact the man was not perfectly sure he had lost any money. He kept his accounts so loosely as not to be able to satisfy himself about it, and it only seemed to him there was a deficiency. He knew, however, that he could not prove it, and besides he was too anxious to retain Thomas in his service to offe4 him by any accusations. But the feeling that he had probably-lost money, and the suspicion that either Thomas or John might have taken it, made him watchful and unpleasantly cautious in all his intercourse with Thomas. Thomas was particu- larly sensitive on such points, and liked to be treated with confidence. He had always been strictly an honest boy and liked to have the name of being one. So although Kennedy made no charge against him, or even against John, directly, he felt irritated by the manner of his employer, and began to think about leaving him. John Grant came in about nine o'clock one   AFTER i MANY DAYS.     175 night, evidently expecting to remain with him as he so frequently had done. It was a hard trial for Thomas to tell him that he was not to stay any more, but he determined to do it. The last customer had gone out, and they were sitting on the counter, eating pea-nuts. "Let's go to bed," said John, "I've been sleepy all the evening. It's awful dull in here, and it's a shame you have to stay so close, when the boys outside have such fun. They wanted me to go to Britton's with 'em to-night, but I thought you'd be lonesome." "I don't care so much about company to- night," said Thomas, catching at the chance, "if you'd like to go-" "Oh no, Id as lief stay," said John, yawn- ing, "you never get no fun since you left Degan's, and I can stand it once in a while." "But I'd just as lief you'd go as not," urged Thomas, "I've got used to staying alone now, and it a'n't as it was when I first came. Go along with the boys, and \have a^good time to- night as you always do." John looked suspiciously at Thomas, and just' then a real suspicion of John crossed the young   176  6  TOM MLLER; OR, clerk's mind for the first time. Was it possible that he really did take the money? "I'd rather stay," John said after watching Thomas's face a moment, and concluding he was not suspected, "as I told you, I'm awful sleepy to-night." "What shall I do?" thought Thomas, "I don't dare tell him the truth, and he won't go, I'm afraid." "I kind o' thought -I'd go around home a little while to-night," he said finally. "Well, I'll stay and keep the store, then," said John quickly, "It will be better than leaving it alone. Kennely mightn't like that." "I'm afraid he won't like it to have anybody but me stay, either," said Thomas uneasily; he could not say anything to induce John to go, and he had not the morai courage to tell him he must go. "Oh, I'm just the same as you-he's seen me here all night lots o' times. He knows I'm all right, or he'd 'a' said something," persisted John. "I don't think he'd like it now," said Thomas, growing very uneasy. "Now see here, Tom Miller," said John sud- I X   AFITE3R MANY DAYS.      1" denly, " what's the fuss? you a'n't used to talkin' in this way about my stayin' here. Does Kennedy suspect---I mean has he lost anything, or wlhat is it?" "What makes you think he's lost anything?" asked Thomas, hardly knowing what to say. He was too much afraid of John to talk plainly to him, although he now strongly suspected him of stealing the money from the drawer, "'Cause you act so strange. Out with it, Tom, you know we are friends. What is the matter?" "Kennedy Ias lost some money," said Thomas. "And does lie think we took it?"John asked uneasily. Of course if he suspects one, he sus- pects both. We must 'hang together, Tom, if there's anything brought agin us!" "No, I don't think he suspects me," said Thomas, " and I don't think he really knows he's lost any. He can't prove it) anyway, for he said so, and that he shouldn't make no accusations. But he acts queer and looks suspicious all the time, and I don't like it." \ "I shouldn't think you would," said John. "And if he's got such a notion in his head, he thinks it's you just as much as me." John felt   178    rTOM ITT ,T ,rn; O01, quite relieved by the knowledge that Kennedy couldn't prove the loss and intended to make no charge. But he saw that his chances there were over, if Kennedy had missed money or was sus- picious in his direction. "I tell ye what, Tom," he said, starting up and putting on his hat, forgetting about his sleepiness. "I wouldn't stay here to be accused of stealing, if I was you! I can get you a better place than this, easy enough. Britton said if he'd known you was goin' to leave Pat Degan he'd 'a' took you. An' there's lots of fun there. I'll go right around and see him about it to-night, if you say you'll go." Do you suppose, my young reader, that Thomas let John go, now that he was. willing to do so, and resolved to cut his acquaintance, now that he saw reason to believe he had been robbing his employer? That would have been the course of a truly upright, honorable boy who valued principle above all else. But when Thomas Miller, months before, deliberately turned away from his good angel, and refused to do what he saw plainly to be his duty and only safety, he put himself in   Ax'rJ2 i; x MA:NYT DAYS.  179 the power of evil passions, motives and counsel- lors, and there was nothing in the boy so long as he trusted to his own strength, to depend upon in a moment of temptation. An impulse, a feeling of resentment, false pride, or friendship for a bad companion, could very easily overcome any reso- lutions he might make in his own strength. So, although since he had been at work for Kennedy he had resolved never again to enter a drinking and gambling den, though he had been trying to establish the reputation of an honest, industrious boy, and had succeeded,-for Mr. Kennedy, while he distrusted Johh, did not think Thomas guilty,-though he had felt proud of his new position, and glad of his mother's satisfaction in it, all these feelings could not keep him from yielding to his desire for John's com- pany and friendship. He allowed himself to be drawn into a long conversation upon the plan proposed by John, wlfict ended in his consent and even anxiety to go to Britton's; although he knew that place to be one of the worst in the city, more degraded and abandoned than even Pat Degan's. John said he was sure Britton would give him seven dollars a month. That would   180      TOM MTT TIMZR. satisfy his father about the change. John repre- sented that there was "lots of fun" at Britton's, and that Thomas would have the liveliest boys for companions. The truth was, he wanted to get him there as a tool for himself and others in the same business he had begun at Kennedy's- that of robbing not only the mnoney-drawer, but the decanters and cigar-boxes. Britton was glad to get Thomas into his em- ploy. The boy had become popular with the class of men who frequent such places, and he had often heard him praised, and envied Degan for having him. The change was made the next day, and Thoma$, having once partially escaped, was again in the worst snare of the great enemy. Poor, weak human nature! How sorely it needs to rest upon "the Rock of our Salvation!"   'XI. ANOITHER CHANGE. Get thee behind me, Satan!- I know no other word; We each have a battle that must be fought, And alas, if we lack the sword!" IT is very frequently the case when one who las been going on in wrong courses stops in his evil career, does better for a little time, and then again relapses into the sins he left, that he becomes more reckless than one who has gone on in sin persistently from the first. It was so with Thomas.   His self-respect had been awakened for a short time, and other good impulses and fdelings seemed about to resume their long lost influence on his heart duing his stay at Ken- nedy's. But when he deliberately turned back and tool a step toward ruin, by the advice of his false friend John  Grant, the evil propensities 16                  181   182     TOM MLLER;, OR, came trooping back, triumphing over him more completely than ever before. I have not courage to attempt to portray the scenes that surrounded him now. Britton's, as I have already said, was one of the very lowest dens of vice in all the wicked city. Scenes of violence and crime springing from profanity, drunkenness and deceit were of daily, nightly occurrence. In connection with the bar, they also kept a "dance-house" where rude and aban- doned creatures revelled every night in noisy and disgusting orgies until daylight. It does not seem possible to us that there could be anything attractive in such haunts of degradation, but among the very poor and ignorant these places, by the allurements of music, warmth, light and brilliant coloring, become indeed the very gate of hell, and are sometimes the strongest influence against which the Sunday-school has to contend in seeking to save this class of young persons. And this influence is often the more insidious and pernicious that it is unsuspected by the faithful teachers who strive to win the heart to the love of truth and a knowledge of Jesus. This house of Britton's was also frequented by   AITF ER MA-NY DAYS.      183 pugilists, or prize fighters, who spent most of their time practicing their arts in some fencing- rooms near by.  In them  and their pursuits Thomas soon became greatly interested.  He would listen for hours to their accounts of "the. ring," and their feats in boxing and fencing, until he began to feel very anxious to see for himself all their wonderful performances, qnd perhaps to learn to emulate them. Thomas was now becoming acquainted with sin in its worst forms very, very fast. He could play at cards and dice with the best of them. The accomplishment of tobacco-chewing he had mas- tered while at Kennedy's, under the tutorship of John Grant. He could now smoke a cigar, and take a drink of whisky with the greatest ease, though of the latter he was not fond, but drank for company's sake and for fear of being called "spooney."  Profanity and Sabbath breaking had long ago become habitual with him. His serious feelings on account of his sins, or in view of death, very seldom disturbed him now. He was not often alone, and when among the customers, or his own chosen companions, was always full of mirth and jollity. He had not   184    'TOM  rJT.,T ,.-t; 0t, been long at Britton's before he stopped getting his meals at home, and spent his whole time at the shop. After that he very seldom saw his mother, and managed when he did go home never to be left alone with ther. He had always an excuse ready when she asked him to stay.  With all his bravery in subduing his own conscience and the memory of his Bible and Sunday-school, he felt afraid to meet her questioning, loving look, and Ender, heart-searching words. So he kept out of her way. As for Mr. Miller, the money Thomas earned, and his brisk, business-like, manly ways satisfied him that the lad was doing finely. To do him justice, never having been accustomed to spend his time at such resorts, he had very little idea of the extent of the iniquity perpetrated in them. His own faults lay in another direction, and he was too much absorbed in his money-saving plans to understand the danger his boy was in. He knew that some men wasted their money and dis- graced themselves by drunkenness and gamibling, but Thomas had never to his knowledge been drunk, or failed to bring home his monthly earn-      Almost Oere Chap X'1  Alotttee Ca!   r - I f-   AsTERe moM:AYleffey DAYS.   185 ings. The moral effect he never once considered. His boys were too sensible to fall into vice, and waste their hard-earned wages, he said. It was all a matter of dollars and cents with him. The original plan of going on a farm had not by any means been given up by Mr. Miller. His son John had early in the spring gone out into the State of Illinois, and after looking about for some days, had selected a fine tract of land lying on the edge of " timber" as they called the forests. He had removed there with his wife early in June, and Samuel had been married and followed him a few weeks later. The money which they had accumulated before going West had been much of it laid up by these two boys, who had always followed their flather's example of industry and frugality. When they married and set up for themselves they claimed froni the general fund the share they had contributed, which left the father without sufficient money to bAy and stock a farm for himself, and in fact without any help to ' clear it or build himself a )louse. So his present plan was to remain in St. Louis, where he was getting good wages as a laborer, and lay up his own and Thomas's earnings until the boy was old 16i '   186     TOM nTT,TT.5R; OR, enough to help him in setting and working his farm. Katy was stil at service in the family to which she had been. hired on her arrival. They were not religious p' .ple, and she seldom heard the Bible read, or went to church. She sometimes thought of her mother's geitle, patient piety dur- ing that tiresome journey, and of what she had said of Jesus who alone can make us fit for heaven. But REaty too, had that hard, unimpres- sible nature possessed by her father and elder brothers, and the sweet story of the Cross did not move her heart to love. She had no conception of self-sacrifice-there was little in her own nature to respond to such an emotion. With people of this temperament it sometimes seems almost in vain to plead the merits and tenderness of the great Sacrifice for sin. Yet the command stands, "Go preach the gospel to every creature," and God has his own ways of applying His truth to darkened and indifferent souls.. Katy too had inherited the "constitutional vir- tues" of industry, economy and honesty, and was a valued servant. Only Thomas, of all Mrs. Miller's children, had ever seemed to possess her tender conscience and quick, warm, affectionate   AFTFrt MA NY  'Aj1YS.   187 heart.' And he, of whom  until the last few months she had cherished such pleasing hopes, was now, to all outward appearances, farther from the paths of righteousness and peace than any of the others. They had never realized, even for a moment, that there was in the religion their mother loved and practised, food sweeter and more satisfying than all their earthly toil could gain; but he had seen his state of starvation, knew of the bread of life, yet refused to taste. With two of the most noted, pugilists who came to their place, Thomas soon became very well acquainted, and they with many others, "Iiked the spirit of the boy," and showed their liking by numerous favors and praises. He Was very successful in securing and serving customers, and his employer prized him accordingly, and granted him many privileges. John Grant had not profited as much as he hoped by Thomas's removal, for the flatteries of older men soon made the boy feel sufficiently proud to dare to keep him at a distance. John/ had at one time tried to induce him to aid in a plot'for systematic pil- fering of tobacco, liquors and spending-money. But though he had not sufficient moral courage   188     TOM MTTlT-T R; ; OR, to make a decided refusal, or to expose John, he managed not to be of much use to him. Thomas had very little temptation to -dishonesty of this kind, for he received more in the way of presents and treats from those he pleased by promptness and good nature in serving, than he could have secured by dishonesty. He often received more money in this way during a month than his wages, and his father, knowing nothing about it, gave himi great credit for his promptness in bring- ing his earnings home to him. After a little, Thomas began to go occasionally to the fencing-rooms and became quite familiar with the things and scenes there. A great prize fight was soon to come off between two pugilists whose names were Dillon and Pheelan. In bet- ting on the result, and discussing the merits of the fighters, more whisky was drunk, more oaths uttered, more quarrels got up and settled by blows than ever before, even at John Britton's. Even Thomas had " taken sides," and was enthusiastic and vociferous in praise of his favorite, Pheelan, and if Britton himself had not seen the danger in time, and become equally enthusiastic over Dillon, that worthy with his adherents would   A  cFTER :MANY DAYS.     189 have bought their whisky elsewhere. As it was, both parties cayne to the house, business flourished, money and whisky changed owners, and Britton rurbbed his hands with great satisfaction after shutting up every night. "I tell ye Tom," he would say, "'twas a bright thought in us takin' both sides. Afore this fight is over, I'll make a fortin' if they keep on this way." "But I took the right side ;"Thomas said stoutly, for he was terribly in earnest in his par- tisanship. "Pheelan is the best man, and he 'll win of course. I could fight Dillon myself-he's no bigger than I am-at least not much!" "What do you suppose I care who wins?" Britton replied with a good-natured laugh. "I dare say you're right. But keep it up my boy, you for Pheelan and I for Dillon, strong, and I'll make you somethin' worth while when it's over." Thomas heard so much from the friends of Pheclan of'Dillon's entire unfitness for the honor of contending with his opponent, that he really believed it to be all true. Dillon was a small man, scarcely larger than Thomas, who was very tall and stout f6r his age. It had been reiterated   190     ToOM MTT,TTWER; On, so many times in his hearing that Dillon had "no strength and no training," "a boy could upset him," that Thomas began seriously to entertain thoughts of entering the lists with him himself, and saving his favorite the ignominy of a contest with one so inferior. The idea was not immedi- ately carried into effect, but was pondered over more and more as he became familiar with the exercises, and his courage, strength and skill were praised by his friends, the Pheelan party. It is not probable, however, that the feat would ever have been undertaken, had it not happened one day that Thomas, after having been two or three times flatteringly included in a "treat" and taking his liquor as strong as the rest did, to be manly, had leave to go out for an hour or two to the fencing-rooms, where they met Dillon and some of his adherents. The whisky he had taken had mounted to his head, and set his tongue in rapid motion. He was loudly boasting, and practising feats of strength and agility, openly applauded but se- cretly laughed at by the men in the rooms. John Grant was there too, and the brilliant idea of conquering Dillon in his presence, and thus show-   AFT3ER M AN&Y DAYS.      191 ing his superiority over both, took fast hold of his beclouded intellect. He walked up to Dillon and began to chal- lenge him to a trial of prowess at boxing. That "hero," however, paid very little attention to his overtures for some time, laughingly returning his excited blows. Thomas, heated and crazed with drink, became more and more earnest and insult- ing in his manner, until at last stung and irritated to a sudden fit of anger, Dillon turned upon him like a lion. The first blow sent him reeling to the floor, but the angry 'fighting man" continued to pound him until the others interfered and rescued him. Thomas always afterwards remem- bered a distinct view of thousands of stars, but had no farther memory of the encounter. He was taken, bruised, blackened, bleeding and insensible as he was, home to his father's house. They had carried him first to Britton's, but he said he had "no use for him" in that state, and directed them to his own home. It was about three o'clqck in the afternoon, and Mrs. Miller, having washed her dinner dishes and swept up her floor, was sitting patching a pair of over-alls for her husband. She had not   192    TOM 1 MLER;; OR, hlard or seen them coming, and when in answer to a loud knock at the door she opened it, the sight was alarming. Four men were carrying her boy, whom she recognized at once, notwith- standing the blood and dust, dead, as she thought. Heart-broken and suffering as she was, her first thought was a prayer. There was a little wooden settee in the room on! which they laid him and hurried away. One remained long enough to put a pillow, which she brought, under his head, and assure her that he was not dead. "Plenty of cold water will soon bring him round," he said, and then followed the rest, and Mrs.- Miller was alone with her still insensible boy. It was the first time she had seen him in two weeks, and she had just been sitting there yeariling for a sight of the face of her boy; that bright, young face on which she, with a mother's keen instincts, had lately read the signs of dissipation and reckless- ness, though most persons said it was growing-so manly and handsome. She brought water and washed away the blood and dirt, and arrnged his hair lovingly and ten- derly, stopping many times to kiss his forehead and cheeks. His face was terribly bruised and *    AiFTER MVIANY DAYS.     193 swollen, his eyes discolored and entirely closed. Nobody but a mother could have kissed that repulsive face. She did not know what had hap- pened. The men said he had been "upset in a fight," and she supposed he had been near where others were fighting and been thrown down and trampled upon, or something of that kind. And yet her heart felt that all his surroundings were evil, that her boy was being carried away by some sinful influences, beyond her power to rescue. Her love and tenderness had ceased to restrain. She could only sit at home and pray, while he was, she knew not where.  Not one of her numerous family had come to know her Lord, or to have hope of eternal life. And she had prayed so many years, had watched and waited for the work of redeeming grace so patiently. Yet here was her youngest, her most hopeful child, only sixteen years old, dying, perhaps, at any rate living in the road to eternal death. But she did not distrust her God. "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him," was thdlanguage of her heart. It was cruel grief to feel that her beloved must be lost, yet she thought of what Mrs. Rushton had once said, "He knows what paths to Lead 17   194     TOM MVILLER; OR, you by; He knows what you need. Keep close ,to him in every trouble. It softens the blow to stand near to Him who holds the rod." She thought over all these things as again and again she bathed that blackened, swollen face, and chafed those helpless hands. His condition revealed much to her love-sharpened senses. His breath was unmistakably laden with the fumes of whisky. In one pocket she found the half of a cigar, in another a paper of chewing-tobacco. In removing his coat she displaced a pack of dirty cards which fell scattering to the floor. And when after an hour of effort she at last recalled him to partial consciousness, his first word was a horridly profane oath. He did not at first recog- nize her, but glared around with his blackened eyes half-opened and uttered angry threats mixed with vile, low epithets. She put the water again upon his face, and made him drink some, and after a few minutes he looked up and knew her. "Is it you, mother?" he said, and then over- come with shame and confusion, he closed his eyes and turned his head away, groaning with pain.   AFTER   I MANY DAYS.    195 She brought some quilts and pillows, set some chairs before the settee and made him as comfort- able a bed as she could. Her heart was too full. She could not talk to him. She had no questions to ask. She knew too much already. Her heart was all the time lifted up. in silent, agonizing prayer, and she felt as if it was the only way she could live, to keep close to Jesus-hold fast by his promises, and trust in Him. And there she was still sitting, weeping and praying, when her- husband came in at night. She roused herself to answer his questions so far as she was able, and remembered that she must prepare his supper. Thomas pretended to be asleep, and his father in compliance with his mother's request did not disturb him, but after looking at him for a few minutes stepped towards the door. "I'm going down to Brittons to find out about this," he said. "Do you know where 'tis, Jane?" "Yes, at Third and IJocust Sts.," she said. The mother had long ago found that out, she hardly knew holw, and kept it in her memory ever since. It had been something to her to know   196     T  VOME MTTTE:RT; ORI, where her darling son was, when she saw him so seldom.  Mr. Miller walked in to Britton's very ex- citedly. He had not got as near the truth as the mother, and he believed his son had been set upon and beaten by some one while in the per- formance of his duty. And in his blind rage he attacked Britton so roughly that he retaliated by throwing all the blame on Thomas. And when the father stated his belief that the boy would never get well, all in the room anxious to screen themselves, joined in Britton's statements. The boy drank, gambled, fought' and disgraced the place generally, the proprietor said. "I used to think he were a fair boy," added one of the others, " but he's been going on dread- ful these last months." "I wonder you didn't see it, Mr. Miller, but I suppose you didn't see him much," said another. "He took no less than four drinks from the bar before he went out to-day," said a third. "I thought 'twas a wonder Britton allowed it." "'Twan't no use to try to stop him, an' I got along with him as well as I could," Britton ex- plained.   ALIi'T'ER .M:ANY' DAYS.   197 "He was a hard boy, an' no mistake," said Pheelan, "about the worst boy for his age I ever seed. A perfect tiger, as I said to-day when he pitched in, determined to fight with Dillon." "You see he began the fight hisself," said the landlord, "the boys all said they never seen a body bear more than Dillon did afore he laid a finger on him." "If the boy was mine, I'd as lief he'd be dead as alive," growled Dillon, himself, "he'll never be nothing but a disgrace to ye. The wickedest young varmint I ever set eyes on. He worrittod me an hour, and if he ever gits up I'll prosecute ye for havin' a boy that 'll commit assault and battery on a peaceful individual." And so poor Mr. Miller returned home fairly persuaded that Thomas was a young ruffian of the deepest dye. These men were the very ones who had most flattered and petted Thomas, but they were afraid that if the boy died there would be an investigation of the affair, and thought it was safest to talk in this ray to keep his father from prosecuting any further inquiries. Thomas was, or seemed to be, still asleep when his father returned. But though he did not b  17'   198     TOM MLLER; oI, directly address him, Mr. Miller could not refrain from angrily going over all he had been told at the grocery, to his wife, and the unhappy boy heard it all,. At last he could bear it no longer. ," It is not true, father, not a word of it!" he burst out, "the contemptible, sneaking --  "You're awake, are ye?" said his father coming up to the settee, " it's well for ye, ye got sooch a batin' and are lyin' thar; to think of the likes of ye, to go disgracin' a respictable family a drinkin' an' fightin'." Although Thomas had been deceived by the men who had made so much of him, and now turned against him and laid all his wrong-doing upon his own shoulders, still when he came to think about it, there was very little he could deny in his father's statement. He had been drunk, had played at cards, and had attacked the man who had beaten hiem. So he lay still and listened to the angry man's violent threats, thank- ful that his bruises saved him at present from their being carried out. There was at least one good effect from the whole affair. Mrs. Miller had for some time, for Tommy's sake, been very anxious to leave the   AFTER MANTY DAYS.      199 city and get out into Illinois. That night she urged it so strongly upon her husband, that she succeeded in convincing him that they had better go at once. And as we have seen that when Samuel Miller's mind was made up he was not long in acting upon it, before Thomas was re- covered from his injuries the arrangements were all made and they were to start in a week's time, and join the older boys in the country where they were living, forty-two miles from St. Louis. Thomas was, on the whole, glad to go.  He dreaded meeting again any of the men and boys who had seen his encounter with Dillon, for fear of their ridicule, and he was too angry at Britton to return there, though when that bad man found he was getting well, he would have been glad to get him back. / * r   XII. SER3KINyG A PRAIRIE Bf02rE. EARLY   the next week the furniture was packed up and the preparations were com- pleted for their removal. Mrs. Miller did not mind the trouble and discomfort of moving now; 4 she was glad to go, for she hoped the change might save her boy. She remembered what Mrs. Rushton said about being out of the way of temptation in the country. The day before they started, Mr. Miller bought a cow which was to be driven out with them to the farm. He saw a man too, who said that his house was very near. where his sons lived, and as he was in town with a wagon and horses, Mr. Miller hired him for five dollars to take them and their goods to the place. It was a beautiful summer morning when they started,-Mrs. Miller and the boxes in the wagon with the man, and her husband and Thomas 200   ATEfTER :EA{Y DAYS.     201 driving the cow behind them. They rode all day, Mr. Miller and his son "taking turns" rid- ing on the back of the wagon when they got tired. It was not such rough, hard riding as their long journey over the Pennsylvania mountains had been, for the road was smooth and almost free from stones. Still it was a very tiresome day for Mrs. Miller, and when, just before sunset, the man pointed to a house in sight and said it was his, she felt very glad, for she thought it likely he would invite them all to stop there to supper be- fore going to their own home. He drove straight to his barn and began to unharness the horses. Mr. Miller hurried up to say, "Look here, sir, hadn't ye better leave yer horses oni, an' take the woman an' things over to John's; after they rest a bit? We're very anxious to get on." "I a'n't a' goin' no further to-night, nor no other time," growled the man, going on with the work. "Well now, it seems to/ine that's not just the thing," said Thomas, coming up in time to hear him, "I thought you agreed to take us to our own place."   202     TOM MLLSEPR; OR, "I supposed of course you would take me and the things to my son's," said Mrs. Miller. "But perhaps it isn't far, father, and John can come over after the boxes, and we can walk." "How far is it?" asked Thomas. ' Where to?" muttered the man. "Why, to my son John's-John Miller's-on Elk-Horn perary where you've hired to take us to," said Mr. Miller. "You bgreed to take us there for five dollars, and here you take us to your own house instead." "I didn't 'gree to no such thing," said the man, I told ye I lived near your son's, an' so I do, for 'ta'n't mor'n twenty mile, an' we call that near, out here on the perary, and you asked me what I'd take you home with me for, an' I said five dollars, an' I've done it!" "You don't mean to tell me we are twenty miles from John's, and you won't take us no further?" said Mrs. Miller, frightened at the thought. "Yes, ma'am, I do. I 'greed to take ye home with me for five dollars, and I've got home. You did not say nothing about my takin' you to your sOlnS.?   AFITER MVANY DAYS.      203 It is of no use to attempt describing the wrath of Mr. Miller when he discovered the wicked deception that had been practiced upon him. He raved and stormed, forgetful of everything else. The man coolly put his horses in the barn, fed them, and walked into the house, leaving the strange family around the wagon. They looked about; there was no house within sight. The sun had set, the dew was falling, and they were hungry and tired. What was to be done? Mr. Miller was too angry to consider the question; his wife and Thomas could think of nothing but to hire the man to go on with them. Thomas said he believed that was just what he wanted, and sure enough, after a few minutes he came to the door and called to them. "I say! you can't go on to Elk-Horn perary to-night, anyhow. You can sleep in the barn if ye want to, and I'll take ye over there to-morry for three dollars more!" Mr. Miller danced with rage, and said with an oath that he would neveripay it, never, if he did not get to Elk-Horn for a year. The man went backlinto the house. Thomas buili a fire and got out his motier's   -204    TOM MITjEn; oOn, big basket which carried some provisions they had bought in the city before starting. After they had eaten their supper, which Mrs. Miller cooked by the fire that Thomas built on the side of the road, and were sitting talking over what they should do, Mr. Miller still refusing to pay the man any more money, they saw a boy with a yoke of oxen going across the prairie a long way from the barn. Thomas ran out to him. In reply to his questions he found out that the man had not only deceived them about the distance lhe lived from the Elk-Horn prairie, but the direc- tion also, and that they were now forty miles from St. Louis, and full eighteen miles farther north than they should be to go to their son's place. Thomas felt very indignant, but it was all of no use. They had been deceived and could only submit. He asked the boy if he or his folks could take them to his brother's, but he said they could not. Mr. Morgan, the man who brought them, was the only one about those parts who had a team and wagon. Thomas walked slowly back to the barn where his poor mother was sitting on a stick of timber, trying to rest herself after the long ride. It was   A3iFTER MrANY DXAYS.    205 now getting quite dark. He wondered if that man really meant to let her sleep in the barn, while he had a comfortable house. His father and he could get along well enough, but he felt very angry to think that they should not' offer his mother a,comfortable supper and a bed. Finally he resolved to go and ask the woman whom he had seen several times at the door, to let his mother come in and lie down, and went to the house for that purpose. "What do you want, you young Irish thief?" called out Mr. Morgan as soon as he saw him. He was sitting at the supper-table, and the room looked neat and cheerful. "I came to see if you would let my mother come into the house and rest. /She is very tired, and will be sick if she stays out all night." "No," said the man, "I told you -you could sleep in the barn. It's good enough for dirty emigrants." "You know my mother isn't dirty," said Thomas, his face hot witJl passion, "she is as good as you are, and never lived low in her life!" aLet the woman come in, Tim," said the wife, 18   "v vJUV -l'.LVV  . LJLj-VtU'lllJ ; O-P. "she looks delicate, and as neat and clean as anybody." "Oh yes, you're always pleadin' for every old tramp," said her husband roughly. Somebody has said that we always hate those we have injured, and I suppose that was the reason Mr. Morgan felt so unkindly toward this family he had deceived. "They'll get along well enough in the barn. Be off, you young rascal, and see that you don't leave the. barn door open! Yer father's out of tobaccy, I heard him say, so he can't set it afire, smokin'!" And with his blood boiling and his fist clinched, really aching to strike the selfish, hard-hearted man, Tommy went back through the darkness to where he heard voices and found his father and mother sitting still on the timber. She was trying to persuade him to hire the man to take them on in the morning, as there was no other -way. But though he could not tell what else to do, he still sullenly refused. The barn was not so very uncomfortable after all. The hay was fresh and new, and as the night was not cold, Mrs. Miller slept comfortably and   AFTTER MA^INY DATYS.    z207 awoke refreshed. They had expected to be only one day on the road, and therefore very little food was left for breakfast that morning; not enough to satisfy hunger, and there were no more sticks to be found to build another fire. Thomas had re- membered how cheering a cup of tea used to be to his mother on their long journey, and as she had some with her, and a little tin tea-pot, he was very anxious she should have that,at least, to sustain her. So he watched until Mr. Morgan had left the house to see about his horses, and taking the tea-pot in his hand, went up to the back-door and asked foW a little hot water in it and the privilege of setting it on the stove. The woman shook her head and pointed to the front-door, through which he could see AIorgan approaching. But she snatched the tea-pot, poured it full of boiling water from the kettle, and hurriedly handed it back. "Set it down a few minutew and it 'll draw," she said, (and boy, you might just as well let him take you first as last, For there's nobody else can do it!" Tommy found the tea really quite good, and felt great satisfaction in seeing his mother drink   it. He had been so thoroughly subdued and ashamed at the time he was hurt, and felt so grateful to his mother for her care and kindness, that he had been very thoughtful for her ever since. He avoided talking, however, and was very shy of being alone with her, for fear she would speak to him about religion. He told them what the woman said, and finally they per- suaded Mr. Miller to hire the man to take them on. Hunger, and the conviction that there was no other way, made him yield, though he did it very sullenly. He would not go near the man, but consented that Tommy should, to tell him that they were ready to go. Mr. Morgan would not harness his horses until he had been paid the three dollars, but then he hurried around, and they were soon on the way again. It was nine o'clock before they got started, and at noon they arrived at a stream on whose farther bank was a cabin with a sign; of whisky for sale, opposite which there was a flVt-boat used as a ferry, to carry teams across. They crossed upon it without difficulty, and as soon as they arrived on the other side Morgan began putting the boxes out of the wagon by the help of a man he called   from the ferry, and asked Mrs. Miller to get out. "Why, are we there so soon?" she said; "then it wasn't twenty miles after all!" "You're nearly there," he answered, "and I must get back, for my work's all stopped for you." Mr. Miller and Thomas wNre both looking after the cow, which had become frightened on getting off the boat and had started to run away. Before they secured her and got back, Morgan was nearly over the ferry again, and once on the other side drove off rapidly. Mrs. Miller told her husband what he had said about their being almost there. "What place is this?" he asked of a man who just then rode up on horseback. (Pulham's Ferry," said-the man; "where be you a goin'? Is them your traps?" pointing to ;he boxes. "Yes," said Mr. Miller. "How far is it to Elk-Horn prairie?" "A matter of about twelve mile," said the nan. "I live on the Elk-Horn; my name's iunningham." s18    210     TOMu MiTILLTER; OR, l"Do you know John Miller, or Samuel Miller?" "Yes, sir, both of 'em. They live two miles beyond me, a matter of fourteen mile from here." "That man has cheated us again, father," said Thomas in great excitement. "Here we are, nearly fourteen miles from home yet, and he's put mother out and left us! Isn't it too hard to be left this way?" It was too true. The money was all the man had cared for. He thought they would get through some way. .They could walk, he thought, if there wasn't anybody about they could hire to take 'em. If Mr. Miller had been angry before, he was now enraged, furious. It was impossible for him either to contain or express his rage and chagrin. To be twice cheated by one selfish, wicked fellow, was a little too much. "It's an awful mean trick," said Cunningham; "the meanest I ever heerd on. Tell ye what I'll do. I've come in to get some whisky for my harvest hands, an' I'm goin' right back. Yer old woman can ride with me on the boss. He'll carry double first-rate. Pulham 'll take care of   AiTFTE M3:ANlY DAYYS.   2" yer things till John can come for 'em. Youn' the boy kin walk." The man was really kind-hearted, and it was the best that could be done. So they started again, with the mother on the horse behind Mr. Cunningham, and the father and son driving the cow. But not till the family in the cabin had given them a good and plentiful dinner of corn cakes and fried pork. For four miles beyond Pulham's ferry it was woods, or "timber" as the settlers called it. There was no real road, b* a tolerable path, along which Cunningha/n rode ahead, and the others followed on foot. Mrs. Miller was a good deal frightened, for she had never been on horseback before in her life, but she managed to hold on to the man before her and keep her seat. The woods were very beautiful indeed. Plants and flowers which they had never seen were growing and in bloom on every side.  The branches of the trees hung down around them, making a cool shade, and sometimes brushing their faces as they passed. It took them about an hour and a-half to get through the timber, for it was slow travelling along a wood-path.   212     TOM MLLER; OR, When they came out of the forest it was upon the edge of the great Elk-Horn prairie of which they had heard so much. It was indeed a grand sight, this great waving sea of grass and flowers. The season of its greatest beauty was past, for the early growth of May and June is far more lovely than any that comes afterwards upon the prairie. Still there were a great many flowers even yet, of beautiful forms and brilliant colors, and Thonmas thought he had never conceived of anything half so charming. Oh mother," he said, running up by the side of the horse on which she was riding, " did you think a prairie, a real, wild prairie, could be half so nice as this?" "No, I did not," she said, her eye kindling as she looked over the waving expanse. "It makes me think of the plains of heaven and their never- dying' flowers." Oh, them flowers a'n't no 'count," said Mr. Cunningham, who had been very chatty all the way, "nasty weeds every one on 'em.  'Fore you've been on your farm a year, you'll hate the sight of a perary flower worse 'n pison!" Mr. Miller began to grow good-natured for the   AJTiER MANY DAYS.'      2i3 first time since he had found out Morgan's deceit- ful trick the night before. "This is jist what I heard about," he said ex- citedly, "don't you remember, Jane, what I told ye? The grass as tall as a mon on a horse's back!" Sure enough it was very nearly so, and though very pleasant to look at, it was not very pleasant to travel through, along a narrow path by the side of a plough-track, or "furrow." It required a good deal of skill to keep the tall, seed-laden heads of the grass from striking them in the face as they walked.  With' his double load, Mr. Cunningham's horse did not travel very fast, and it was not hard to keep up with him all the way across the prairie. After nearly three hours more of travel, they came in sight of a "clearing" which he said was his place. It was now sunset,'and this man, much more kind and humane than the one the night before though he wiaseMdr no pecuniary obligation to be so, insisted on their gdlng in to supper with him, and staying all night at his house. But Mr. Miller, now that he had got so near to his son's, was determined to go on without stopping   214     TOM MLLER  ; O:R, for anything. It was now only two miles, he said, and they could walk that before it was fairly dark. So not waiting even for his wife to rest, he helped her down from the horse, and offered to pay Cunningham for bringing her, while she walked on with Thomas. But the man would take no money. "You've lost enough," he said, " by that mis- erable sneak over the river. I ha'n't done much for ye, but such as 'tis ye're welcome to." Thanking him, Mr. Miller hurried on to over- take the others. There i-something very peculiar about travel- ling over the prairies. Although it really is level, you feel all the while as if you were just going to ascend a hill. Especially in, walking, this sensation is very strong, and the traveller will actually lift his feet as if he were going to step up. This makes it more tiresome than other walking, and our travellers found it more and more fatiguing as they went on. It grew dark very rapidly too, and the dew was falling quite heavily. The long grass swept against them with its burden of drops until their clothes were really saturated and heavy. It began to be very diffi-   AFT:ER MANtr DAYS.      215 cult too, to keep the path, for it was much less travelled than it had been the other side of Cun- ningham's place, and the darkness almost con- cealed it at time. Still they managed to keep in a track which they supposed to be the right one, and toiled on. But when they had been walking a very long time they saw no signs of a house or cultivated fields. On and on they went, for there was nothing else they could do. The poor mother's strength was nearly exhausted. Her clothes were completely wet through with the dew; her face and hands irritated and smarting from the switch- ing of the tall coarse grass, and her feet so weary that it seemed as if she could scarcely raise them. Still she did not complain, and Mr. Miller did not seem to think her fatigue or discomfort any greater than that of the others. Thomas thought of her, and spoke as kindly and cheerfully as he could, but he was himself so tired with the long walk added to the fatigue of the day before, that he felt as if he could nat hold out much longer. At last, when they had been walking so long that it seemed that it must be midnight, they saw a log house just before them, and on beyond it a   '216    TOM IMTTiT,FiR; OR, dark line which they knew must be the 'edge of another forest. "Here we are at last, at Samuel's," said Thomas, "but that last man must have told us wrong as well as the other, about the distance. I know we have come more than two miles." Mr. Miller walked straight up to the door and knocked very loudly. "Who's there?" called out a sharp, but not unpleasant voice. "Who lives here?" asked Mr. Miller in reply. "Archie McLane!" "Oh dear," groaned Mrs. Miller; "ask him where Samuel Miller does live," she suggested. "Do you know where Samuel or John Milller lives?' inquired Mr. Miller again. "Yes, they're both near neighbors of mine, 'bout three miles off. You're their old folks, 'n't ye? I heerd tell they was expectin' ye." By this time the man had opened the door, and now urged them to come in. "Ye've come right by their place," he said, "for I s'pose ye've come from Pulham's ferry. It's three miles back. Lots of 'em does get lost crossin' the perary."   AFTER MA;NY DAYS.       217 Three miles back! Mrs. Miller felt as if it was impossibleto take another step that night, and sank down exhausted upon the chair set for her by Mr. McLane. As for Thomas, forgetful of his age and manliness, he sat down on the floor and cried like a baby. He was so tired, so hun- gry, so wet and discouraged. They had met with so many disappointments since they started, that now, when they supposed they were at home, to be told that they must go back three miles over that same prairie, was a little too much. By-and-by Mrs. McLane came in and set about getting them something to eat. Both she and her husband were very kind and insisted upon their staying there all night. Mrs. Miller and Thomas would have been glad to do so, but late as it was, and it was now nearly midnight, Mr. Miller insisted on going back to Samuels, and his wife was obliged to submit. He was so indig- nant at the treatment he had received, and so cross about the mistake they had made in losing their way, that it was net safe to oppose him in anything just then. And the more difficulties he met, the more determined he became to accom- plish his purpose. 19 X   218     TOM: MTILL ER; OR, Good Mrs. McLane bustled around, talking as fast as she could all the while, and made Mrs. Miller lie down on the bed while she boiled? the kettle and made a cup of tea. She threw down a big woollen blanket by the side of the stove for Thomas, and he stretched himself out, thinking that nothing had ever seemed quite so pleasant before as that warm stove, the soft blanket, and the smell of the tea and fried pork. Mr. Miller refused to rest, and walked the floor grumbling and telling his troubles to Archie McLane, until the supper was ready. He would hardly sit down to the table at all, but hurried them to "be done and be off." "Ye'd better ha' staid," said Archie McLane, e but if ye will go, I'll put ye on the furrow, an' ye'll go straight to Samuel's door." And, sure enough, there was a single track of the plough stretching straight across the prairie, so that there was no farther danger of getting lost. Keeping close by the side of it they again walked on and on for nearly two hours longer, when they came in sight of another house which proved to be the right one at last. But oh, what a toilsome, painful walk that was to the poor, weary, patient   AFTER MANY DAY-S.      219 mother! She had not spoken a word since they left Archie McLane's, but had plodded along sadly and painfully, sometimes reeling and faint, but with her heart lifted constantly to God for strength, and her lips murmuring snatches of ejaculatory prayer. Well, they were there at last, and Samuel's wife made them as comfortable as she could, putting her mother into her own bed, for she had but one, and sitting up the rest of the night herself. It was long before Mrs. Miller could sleep, for her feet were blistered with the long walk, her limbs aching with chill and fatigue, her face and hands smarting with the scratches from the grass and weeds she had waded through. But as she lay awake thinking of it all, she only said, "Rest at last, thank God, rest at last!" Thomas, too, was very tired, and so no doubt was Mr. Miller. But they both soon fell asleep, and woke up in the morning stiff and lame, but refreshed and cheerful, while the mother was obliged-to keep her bed for two or three days. Early in the morning Samuel started after the goods with his oxen and wagon, and before night he arrived safely at home with them. The house   220     TOM: iJrurTR.; OR, was rather small to accommodate so large a family, being built of rough logs, twenty feet long and sixteen wide, with only one room, and a ladder in one corner leading to a sort of loft or garret. So as soon as Mr. Miller had selected his land and decided how much to take, the next thing would be to build a house for himself. It took him only a day or two to decide. There could not be anything more satisfactory to his mind than this rich waving prairie, and he "took up" eighty acres adjoining his son's farm, and like it, lying next to timber on one side. The house was soon under way. It was to be the same as Samuel's in size and material. Mr. Miller, John, Samuel and Thomas went to work very zealously, cutting logs and hewing them into shape for the walls. And as it was not a very busy time with the farmers just then, wheat harvesting being over and other crops not ready .for gathering, they "changed work" with some of the neighbors. That is, the men worked for them with the understanding that when the house was done they would give as many days' work in return. Yet after all it was nearly three months before the house was ready for occupa-   A FrTrE M ANY DAYS.    221 tion. It had when finished one room with two small windows and a door. The bed was set up in one corner, a stove in another, and a pine table and some chairs completed the furniture. There was a low garret where Thomas had his bed, which he reached by a ladder. It was a rough, rude place in which to live, but it looked very pleasant and bright to Mrs. Miller when she moved in, for it was their own home, and the first one they had ever really owned. Thomas's life was now very different from what it had been in St. Louis. Besides his two brothers there were no neighbors within two miles of them, and there was frequently a week or two at a time that he saw no one but the family. Thus he was effec- tually removed from bad companionship, and could not escape from daily intercourse with his gentle, Christian mother. Mr. Miller bought a yoke of oxen and set himself and Thomas at work to fence the land and prepare it for plough- ing and raising crops the next year. It was not pleasant or easy employrent. Besides the cold and exposure to storms, they were terribly an- noyed by ticks, or small insects, which lived in the wood, and when disturbed, would bury them- 19    ^il  .M      mTOM MLLER. selves in the flesh of the choppers. It was almost impossible to remove them without cutting them out, and they caused great inflammation and pain unless removed at once. But with all the priva- tions, discomforts and hard work there was some- thing pleasant to Thomas about this pioneer life, and he worked willingly and hard at cutting rails all that first winter. His father regained his lost confidence in him, and his mother once more hoped and prayed with some degree of as- surance and faith, that he might be brought to Jesus. -         XIII. THE ACCOIDJENI- "Yet hath he not root in himself." WAS Thomas Miller a better boy than when he left St. Louis? He was not now in the habit of profane swearing, for he had never dared to use such language before his father. Although when angry Mr. Miller was himself sometimes profane, he had always punished his boys for swearing. Neither did Thomas now   drink liquors, for he saw none except on rare occcasions, when there was unusually hard work to do. He did not even have a longing for ardent spirits, for he never liked them, and only drank because he thought it manly. He still used tobacco, and that habit once formed is not so readily laid aside, lut nearly all his other evil practices he seemed to have abandoned. Besides all this he was now very seldom disrespectful or unkind tohis parents, 2 OO   224     TOM MtTTTjEiR; OR, True, there was little temptation to be so, for all their thoughts were alike fixed upon the new farm and its improvement, and the common interest made them talk and act in unison. Thomas was very industrious during all that first fall and winter and into the early spring days, and real hard work is a great enemy to evil habits. He had been, too, where he could not escape the daily in- fluences of his mother's pure and holy life, or refuse to listen to her few, but always timely words of warning. The words of Jesus were her only weapon, and many a text fell upon his indifferent ears during the quiet days of which I write. All this should have made him better. Had it done so? Most persons, looking upon the wicked young bar-tender in St. Louis, and then upon this industrious, ambitious young farmer, would have answered this question very empha-. tically in the affirmative. And no doubt some of my young readers will be surprised when I say that I feel obliged to answer it in the negative. But is there any proof of his having made any effort to do better, and if so, was that effort made from the right motive? True, he was outwardly   AFTwER M   'ANY DAYS.    225 much better. But circumstances had made him so. "Out of the heart are the issues of life." There is no evidence that his heart was' changed in regard to his former sins. He had not heartily. repented of them, nor felt their burden upon his conscience for a moment. He had been ashamed but not penitent. Had he remained in the city,- and it was not a desire on his part to do better which took him away from it,-there is no reason to suppose he would have refrained from any of his evil ways. He had not been softened by his mother's tearful distress sufficiently to feel its true cause. He would not be willfully unkind to her; he loved her and dreaded to see her suffer. But he more and more persistently refused to think of his conduct in the light in which she saw it. Day after day he noticed that she silently withdrew to some lonely place for secret prayer. He knew that she there communed with Jesus, and pleaded for him. But he was utterly indifferent to that Saviour, he would not think of His love for sin- ners, or of his own fate without that pardoning blood. Are you surprised that Thomas could thus utterly refuse to acknowledge what he knew to   226     TOM MLLER; OR, be true? Are not many of you, dear young readers, doing the same thing? From earliest childhood you have been told of the dear Re- deemer who died for you; you have heard from the pulpit on every Sabbath-day the story of His love; you have sat in the prayer-meeting and the Sunday-school, where others gave their hearts to Him, yet you have been unmoved and rebellious still. How do you differ from this rough, un- learned Irish boy, though you may live in beau- tiful and luxurious homes, wear costly clothing, and sit daily in commodious school-rooms under the most carefil and skillful teachers? "Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." Tommy Miller had not yielded his heart to Jesus. He refused to ask Him to be his friend. Therefore he was at the mercy of circumstances and became iwhat they conspired to make him. You have not yielded your heart to the Saviour, perhaps, you refuse to acknowledge Him as your only helper. Is it anything but, circumstances that keeps you from the sins into which he fell? As the spring advanced Mr. Miller and Thomas prepared for plowing and planting. They had   i       AFTER MANY 'DAYS.      227 now fenced in four fields, and had also built a small log stable for the oxen and cow, and a pen for two pigs which 'they bought of a neighbor, and they had a dozen hens running about every- where during the day and roosting at night in the stable. I wish you could have seen their little home when the grass was springing and the trees putting out their delicate oung leaves, and the first young prairie flowers blgan to bloom. Rude as it was, it was a very leasant sight. And the perfect neatness that prevailed within, added to the charm. Mrs. Miller was the same orderly cleanly housekeeper, she had been in her comfortable little home in Philadelphia. Thomas felt a great deal of interest and ambi- tion in the spring work ,on the farm, and was glad when the warm weather promised to come early. But on the very first lovely spring morn- ing that they began their preparations in earnest to put the seed in the ground'for their summer crops, his expectations and calculations were sud- denly dashed to the ground. He was riding on the heavy farm wagon, the wheels of which were cut out of broad plank so that they would not sink into the' soft prairie soil. He had been   228    TOM MT,TT ER; OR, gathering up the various tools they had used in building the fences, and was about to store ,them away in the log stable. He never could tell just how it happened, but a sudden jolt made him lose his balance, and he fell just between the oxen and the broad, heavy wheels. He tried hard, to roll himself out of the way, but was not quick enough. The wheel came crushing over his foot, bruising and mashing it terribly. The pain was worse than any he had ever felt before. When Dillon had knocked him down, he had been in- sensible at once, and the pain afterwards though severe was heavy and constant, but not sharp and agonizing like this. He could not bear to have his father touch him at all, and he lay there on the ground suffering intensely, while Mr. Miller went after John or Samuel to help to take him home. He shrieked and cried with the pain when they lifted him and carried him to the house. His mother saw them coming and hastened to arrange the bed for him. And when they brought him in, his ruddy face all white with the intense suffering, and laid him down before her, she thought of that other time when he was brought   1i      AAFTER1  MANY DAYS.     229 home to her nearly a year before.  She was grieved and anxious now, and pitied her boy most tenderly. But she did not feel as she had felt then. His hurt, whatever it might be, had befallen him in the performance of his duty, while earning his daily bread. It was not in any way the result of sinful practices on his part or the part of others. There is a great difference in the feeling with which we bear a trouble or calamity which comes to us as a part of God's providence, without any positive guilt of our own, and that with which we receive one directly springing from disobedience and wrong-doing. Sad and frightened as she was, suffering and impa- tient as Thomas was, still Mrs. Miller felt that this grief was not to be compared with that she had known on that other dreadful day. As soon as he had helped to lay his brother on the bed as comfortably as they could, Samuel went for a doctor to set and dress the wounded foot. But there was none within ten or twelve miles of them, and for -fearly five hours Thomas lay moaning in agony, the foot becoming con- stantly more and more inflamed. When the doc- tor came, about the middle of the afternoon, the 20   230    TOM MXIvLER; OR, inflammation made the operation much more painful than it would have been at first. But it was finally over, and with his whole limb tightly bandaged, and bathed with a soothing liniment, and after taking a sleeping draught that the doc- tor prepared, he began to feel a little more com- fortable. "How long will it keep me in, doctor?" he said, as the physician was about leaving. "You'll do no work this summer," said bluff Dr. Todd, who never thought it worth his while to disguise, or to break news gently, how- ever bad it might be. {What will the farm an' the crops do without him?" inquired Mr. Miller, anxiously. It irritated Thomas to think that his father thought more about the farm than about him and his suffering, but he said nothing. "Will he suffer much, doctor?" asked Mrs. Miller. "He'll be bad enough for a while," said he, seeming to look at her for the first time. "You are not strong enough to take care of him; he'll want a great deal of waiting on-run, run, run all the time, I dare say. These boys seldom think   i          Ai ATER MAN3VY DAYS.    231 of anybody but themselves, when they are laid up as your boy is. "I can wait on him, doctor, but will he have to lie in bed long? If he could only get up and not be suffering so much." "He a'n't a baby," said Mr. Miller, "he'll get along vell enough, I ;dare say. Only I don't know what we'll do with the work. He's all the help I've got, doctor, an' you must get him up as soon as iver ye can!" "It's nature that?" have to do that," said the doctor; "it takes time for flesh and bones to mend. You can't patch 'em up like other things. The boy's foot is badly hurt, and it will take all sum- mer to restore it, unless he's smarter than I think he'll be." And with this comforting assertion Dr. Todd went home, promising to see him again in about a week, unless he grew worse and they sent for him sooner. There was no help for it. There he was, a strong, ambitious, restless boy of sixteen, with the prospect before him of lying there in that one room all through the beautiful, glorious summer, his first summer in the country. Thomas had   232     TOM MTTTEVR; OR, not cried since the night that he broke down with fatigue and hunger at Archie McLane's, but he could not-help it now. The pain, the disappoint- ment, and the suddenness of it all made him turn his face to the wall and sob for a long time. "Don't be so wake, Tom," said his father, "bear it like a mon! Only for the work, it would be better nor it is. If you'd only-broke it last fall, I could have got other help wi' the rails. You wa'n't hardly strong enough, onyway. Well, I must go and do what I can. It's all on me now," and off he went to the fields again to do what he could to redeem the broken day's work. Mrs. Miller went up to the bed and put her left hand under Thomcss cheek while she wiped his tears away with the other. Then she stooped down and kissed him, whispering, "Don't grieve, Tommy dear, it's all for the best, or God would not have allowed it." "How can it be all for the best, mother," said Thomas fiercely, " what good can it do anybody for me to lie here in pain all summer instead of helping father?" "I don't know, Thomas, but God does."   AFTEER M:ANTY DAYS.     233 "I don't believe anything of it, I tell you, mother," he went on, so violently that he winced with pain from his foot, which he had moved in his angry excitement, 'I don't believe it is for the best, and if God loves us all, as you always said He did, this is a strange way to show it, I think!" "Hush, hush, don't talk in that way, my son; it is sinful. We are not fit to judge of God's doings. When you were a little boy did you not feel sometimes when I whipped you that it was not kind? But you know now that I loved you all the time, and only hurt you for your good. God is our Father, and He punishes us when He- sees that we need it." "But mother, I have been a better boy lately than I ever was before in my life. I have worked hard, and helped to fix the place, and I wanted to raise good crops this summer. It seems to me that it makes no difference whether you are good or bad, these things are just as likely to come one time as the other. "  "You are too tired and sick to talk about it now, Thomas; the doctor said you must try to go to sleep: to-morrow we will talk again about 20 -2   J tJ '    'L'UlVl .VI i .I rlst; .-1 X Jalc it, and see if what you say is true. It does seem so sometimes, certainly. Now I will get father's supper ready while you sleep, and then you can have a cup of tea and a bit of toast." The opiate soon, began to affect Thomas when he was left to himself, and he fell into a refresh- ing sleep, which lasted until his father came in to supper. The next morning after Mr. Miller. had eaten his breakfast and gone out to work, and the dishes were washed and the room made neat, Mrs. Miller was busily preparing as nice a breakfast as she could command for her boy. He had been restless nearly all night with pain and fever, but toward morning had fallen asleep so soundly that she had not wakened him when she rose to get breakfast, and she had done it so noiselessly that he still slept. She had lain across the foot of his bed all night, and his father had slept in Thomas's bed in the loft. There were never any, delicacies in their house. Their daily meals were made of fried pork, corn bread and potatoes, with a cup of tea at supper time. But there was generally a little sugar and sometimes a small package of rice in the corner   AFTTER MANY DAYS./      25O of the cupboard. They had milk and eggs too from their own cow and chickens. Now she cut a slice of bread from the loaf, toasted it nice and brown before the fire, and then laying it on a plate to keep hot, she broke two fresh eggs into a little saucepan of boiling water where they soon cooked very delicately, the yolk just showing through the pure white. She took them into a saucer carefully, put a little cream, salt and pepper over them, and set them beside the toast. Then she poured out a cup of tea into which she put a heaping spoonful of sugar and some thick cream. When it was all ready she went to the bed and listened to Thomas's breathing, hesitat- ing whether to wake him or wait till he woke of himself. Just then he opened his eyes, and she brought the bright tin wash-basin and bathed his face and hands and smoothed his hair as she used to when he was a little boy. When he was ready she brought his breakfast on a piece of thin board with a clean newspaper over it in place of a waiter and napkin. It was a very simple breakfast, and rudely surrounded, yet so neatly and lovingly served that I think any of us would have enjoyed it almost as much as Thomas did. After he had   236    TOM MAL ER; OR, finished it, she raised hip4illows and put a chair behind them so that he could sit up and look out of doors. But the sight of the fresh, green prairie, and their own neat scqiare fields surrounded by the new rail fences, and shining down on all, the golden sunlight, brought back to his face the peevish, rebellious look of the night before. "I think it is hard," he said, "that I've got to lie here so long. I don't mind the pain so much, though it's bad enough, but I did want to get our farm fixed up this summer. I don't believe father will be able to get along without me." "God knows what is best for you, my child." "I wish you wouldn't say that to me again, mother; how can this be best? It certainly was not wrong for me to want to work hard and get us a home, and I don't see how it can be right to keep me from it." "It is not necessary that you should see how it is right, Thomas; I wish you would not think of it in that way." "I can't help it, mother. If God had made me sick, or sent some accidEnt to lay me up when I was in St. Louis, and doing things I ought not   AIATER MANY DA YS.      237 to do, I could see the justice of it. But now when I am a good boy and trying to do good things, I don't see why He should bring this on lne.)l "Thomas, what was it took you away from St. Louis, and from your evil ways there? Was it your own will, or God's providence?" "Why, why,-you and father took me away, but I didn't care about staying, you know; I'd rather go away than not, and told father so." "Yes, but why were you willing to go? Was it to get away from sin, or from ridicule?" Thomas was silent. He knew well enough that it was the love of change, together with the resentment and shame he felt when he thought of going back to BrittoA's, which made him want to leave the city. Had he stayed then, there was no reason to think he would have done any better. "What makes you think you are now a better boy than you were before you came here?"Mrs. Miller asked after a pause. ' "Well, that is a curious question I think," said Thomas, 'you know I don't do anything bad now. I sold liquor and drank it, and smoked,   238     TOM MXILL3IZ; On, and swore sometimes, and gambled too, and lived in that low place where they did a great deal that was wrong. I don't suppose, mother, you ever guessed how they did go on there." "I know enough about it, my son. But why don't you do those things now?" "Why, there's no chance for it, if I wanted to, there a'n't a grocery within six miles of us." -"IThat is it exactly, Thomas; circumstances prevent, and not your own will. Now tell me the truth, if there was a place like Britton's within half a mile of us, and there were men there who praised you, and wanted to make your acquaintance, and treated you like a man, would you stay away from it?" "I might go sometimes," he acknowledged after a little waiting. If you were really a better boy, do you think you would go at all?" "May-be not. But I tell you what, mother, it's awful discouraging not to have you think I am better than I was. Everybody else does." "I do think your conduct is better, and no one can be more glad and thankful for it than I am. I did not think about it in this way myself at   AFTrER:rn MAtNY DAYS.    239 first, but one day the thought came to me, what security have you got that Thomas wouldn't do it all over again if he had a chance?' I want to feel sure that you would not do a wrong thing if you were tempted ever so strongly. I want you to ask yourself the question and answer it to your own heart, how much of this improvement is to be credited to you, and how much to the change in youfcircumstances." Thomas did not speak, and after a minute she added, "You know if you had yourself deter- mined to leave St. Louis, because you saw that you were sinning against God in your daily life, and you wanted to get away from temptation, that would have given you more of the credit. But I am afraid you did not want to go for any such reasons." But mother, I am not fond of drink or any of those things. I just did as the others did. I don't care if I never see whisky or cards again in my life." "So much the more sin when you do such things. A poor man or boy whose love for them overcomes his principles sometimes, may be pitied. But one who does not love them, and yet hasn't   240     TOM MTTT T.ERI; OR, principle enough to refuse to'do wrong, is in the greatest danger." Mrs. Miller spoke very clearly on the subject, for she had thought it all over a great many times during that winter, reading her Bible and praying for light. It would'seem a singular thing to those who do not know the softening, refining, strengthening power of God's Spirit upon the human heart and understanding, that this poor, simple, uneducated little Irish-woman, with her disadvantages and rude associations, grew daily more elevated in thought, language and manner. Yet it was so. "You- always make me out so bad, mother," said Thomas, fretfully. "Father is satisfied with me. He told John the other day that I was as steady and good as a man on the farm. But you are no better pleased than you were a year ago, as I see." "I am pleased to have you away from tempta- tion, my son, and that you are fond of work, and suit your father. But I shall never be satisfied until your heart belongs to your Saviour, and you love Him so entirely that you would not knowingly commit sin under any temptation   AFTER M  AN3Y DAYS.    241 whatever. Then I shall feel safe about you wherever you are. There is a passage in the Bible that I want you to think of--"Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."-And she laid down her knitting- work, and arranged his pillow and bathed his foot and ankle again. 21   XIV. TIME .FO-R REEFLECTION. "If I could choose what would be most delightful and use- ful, it should not be genius, power, wit or fancy, but a firm religious belief. It is above every mental and intellectual gift. It is God's choicest blessing even in this life." ALL through the delicious spring and early summer days, with their wealth of bloom and verdure, their wild bird-notes and soft, sweet, fragrant air through which the golden sunbeams fell like heavenly benedictions upon the beautiful earth, Thomas lay at home in bed. He was not yet able even to step upon his wounded limb. He had been very impatient, restless and rebellious, and his poor mother found it no easy task to take care of him.  When the accident first occurred, she had hoped it would be instrumental in lead- ing him to deeper thoughtfulness and to a view of the Saviour.  But after that first day, he had seemed to shut up his heart against religious truth, 242   AFITEr, sMANY DAYS.     243 and refused to reply when she talked to him on the subject. An old man who lived on a neighboring farm came to see him sometimes, and pitying his con- finement and loneliness, had taught him to make baskets from the willows which grew on the banks of their brook near the edge of tie woods. He amused himself with this work whenever any one would gather the willows for him. Mrs. Miller had hoped, too, that he would turn his attention to books, and cultivate a love for learn- ing, even yet. But it had not been so. Once or twice he had looked at her Bible, for a short time, when she left it near him, but not with interest. The store-keeper at Pulham's ferry sent him some foolish, yellow-covered story books by Samuel one day, and he read them all through several times. But from what his mother saw of them she knew they would harm instead of benefitting him. She would have taken them away, but he complained to his father, who ordered her to let the boy read what he pleased. When mid-summer came he was able to go about on crutches a little, but he could not leave the house, and was very lonely and petulant all   244    TOM MTTl. TFR; OR, the time. His mother could not even yet give up her hope of improving his long confinement by adding something to his very deficient educa- tion, but he did not show any desire to do so. She got his father's consent to buy him a few new school-books, and to have ayoung lady teacher from the nearest school-house, a mile beyond Archie McLane's, come to help him with his lessons. But he had no taste for such things, and so neglected his books day after day, even when he had no better employment than to watch and feed the hens, or fix traps for the' birds which some- times lit on the windows, and the teacher soon felt there was little use in coming. In fact it had always been Thomas's way to follow his own desires and inclinations, rather than the dictates of good sense and reason, as to what was best for him. He was now old enough to understand that he would need some know- ledge of books in the future, but he could not overcome his habit of doing as he liked. And the golden days of opportunity slipped away one by one, unimproved. As the summer went by, Thomas's foot grew stronger and he could go about the yard and out to the stable, by the aid   AFTER MANY DAYS.      245 of his crutches. But it was not healing as well as it ought, the doctor said, and it pained him. very much, sometimes. After a while he found that it was greatly relieved by pouring cold water upon it, and he used to go out to the spring behind the house and sit with a tin dipper in his hand showering it for an hour at a time. Early in the fall he began to lay aside his crutches, and was soon able to walk again; but now nearly all the work was- done on the farm, and though he could accompany his father while digging the potatoes and doing the other late work, he found that his long confinement in the house had weakened him so much that he could not work more than an hour or two without get- ting tired out. As the cool weather came on he continued to gain strength, however, and was soon considered entirely well. In his anxiety to get to work again, for laziness was never one of Thomas's failings, he determined to hire out for the re- mainder of the fall, and thus earn some money which would help to imprpve the farm next year. There had been a brick-yard started a few miles away, and he found that he could get employment 21 a   246    rOM MTT T4Fc, OR, there. For a few weeks he succeeded very well, being employed in- what is called, " off-bearing," or carrying the bricks when taken from the mould to the kiln where they were to be dried. But it was not long before his foot began to be lame again and very painful, and he was obliged to go home and remain in the house with his mother for the whole winter, most of the time getting about only on his crutches. So when the spring time came again, he had spent nearly all the year indoors. To a boy naturally bright and intelligent, as he was, how usefully this time might have been occupied. How much progress in various branches of study might have been made. But it had been time wasted to him. Years afterward, when it was too late to recall the opportunity, how much would he have sacrificed to be allowed again even the advantages of that time, meagre is they were. Many a school-boy would smile at the thought of calling the circumstances that surrounded him "advantages" for education, yet how many self- made great men have achieved distinction with lesser ones! During the third summer Thomas's health and   A-FTER EMANY J DAYS.     247 strength seemed perfectly restored, and he worked hard with his father on the farm. There were no incidents of any importance. Their whole thought and attention were still upon the farm, which was fast becoming productive and amply repaid all their outlay of money, time and strength. Mrs. Miller still lived on her lonely, self-forget- ful life. Day by day she seemed to grow farther and farther away in spirit froni all the rest of the family, yet she was their reliance for all the home comforts and cheerful neatness which, at least, they could prize. John and Samuel's wives were hard-working, and tolerably amiable women, but worldly and unsympathetic, coarse in nature and growing coarser by contact with surrounding influences. They felt afraid of their mother-in- law, for she talked to them of religion in a way that made them feel unpleasantly as they thought of their sins. Five miles away a small church had been organized in the school-house, and they had preaching once a month. Though not of her own denomination, Mrs. Miller never missed these meetings if the weather would in any way permit her attendance. Sometimes she wQmlld get   248     TOM MTTT,TR;. OR, a ride with some more distant neighbor who went with his oxen and wagon to carry his whole family, but oftener she walked the entire distance, stopping at Archie McLane's for dinner on the way back.  The country was getting settled rapidly, and there was already talk of a school- house on the prairie near them. Mr. Miller and Thomas never went to church, or to meeting, as they called it, at all. There was iio such attraction in the dear name of Jesus, the sinner's friend, that they would go such a distance to hear of Him, and to commemorate His love. As we have said, there was no event of any note in their lives that summer, and so leaving them in their quiet little prairie home, which might have been such a happy one with God's blessing resting down upon the hearts within it, in answer to faithful prayers and earnest desires for His guidance, we will look back to the friends they left behind in Philadelphia and see what changes these three years have brought to them. Mr. Rushton is still superintendent of the Sunday-schodl in Eleventh St., and we will look into the Chapel at the hour of its session. Two   AFTER lvMANY  DAYSs.    249 hundred children with their teachers are before us. A large school for the days of which we are speaking, but the constant efforts of MVr. Rushton and his wife and daughter, aided by some of his corps of teachers, have not gone unrewarded. Mrs. Rushton is surrounded by a large Bible- class of young ladies. Gertie has the infant class of about thirty little ones. Now in her fifteenth year, and for two years a member of the church, she is trying to lead these little lambs to the Good Shepherd. The librarian wears a face which looks familiar. It is John Bennett, the idle, ungoverned truant boy of six years ago. His radiant face shows the heartiness and freshness of his zeal in labor- ing for Christ, while every word and movement shows not only religious earnestness, but a degree of culture and literary attainment we should not have looked for in him. .But John's nobler nature once aroused, his heart once opened to re- ceive the heavenly gift of pardoning love, he has gone steadily onward, omitting nothing, discour- aged at nothing which will advance his usefulness and Christian enjoyment. During the day he worked at his trade of carpentering, and in the   250     TOM MrTT T,i; OR, evenings after his days' work was done, he studied hard and carefully all the common branches of education. Passing on from these he mastered a good deal of scientific and literary lore, and studied his Bible by the aid of the researches of others, found in the best commentaries and text- books. He has not labored alone and unnoticed for self-improvement, for Mr. Rushton  has watched and aided his steps until he has learned to regard the boy with almost parental love and pride. And the church, observing the unaffected piety and well-improved talent of the young man, for he is now nearly twenty years of age, are planning his support at college to prepare for the ministry so soon as his apprenticeship expires. He has been very useful in the church and Sab- bath-school, and has great influence among those of his own age. Contrast John Bennett as he stands there, at- tending to the duties of his .office, energetic, intel- ligent, full of interest and ready for self-denial in anything that will advance his Master's cause, his bright, handsome young face glowing with enthusiasm and earnest, working love for Jesus, with Thomas Miller as he goes about his daily   AFTER; MANY DAYS.       251 work. He too is energetic, active ahd ambitious. But it is only for the things of this world, and even those are of the most material nature. He has inherited industry and thrift-but what has he done for himself? What trait of character can he claim to have acquired, by choice and per- severance? Not one. As we look at the two boys, both now fast verging upon manhood, is it not evident that the great difference between them lies in the fact that one has chosen Christ and Duty, the other Self and Pleasure? Thomas was the more promising boy, and had most in his life and circumstances to encourage hope. But he would not yield. He saw the path but refused to walk in it. He heard the Saviour's pleading at the door of his heart, but bolted it against Him, un- willing to resign self-will. As year by year goes by, the rust is gathering over the lock, the hinges move heavily, the heart is shut in and darkened against God's blessed sunlight of truth and mercy. When shall it be opened?  Where shall the contrast end between these two? One has chosen the good part, the other has refused it. That one act has shaped the course of each life, and their ways are rapidly diverging. Shall the   252     TOM MTTTT'R; OR, separation go on widening until one reaches the bliss and fullness of heaven and the other sinks into the dreadful abyss of hell? We are told that there is a place where two clear, beautiful springs of water gush out within a yard of each other. A stone lies between them and turns their course in opposite directions. One flows to the placid and beautiful Pacific, its banks crowned with flowers, verdure and golden stores. The other winds through bleak and barren ice-fields to the frozen ocean of the North. Yet at first only a pebble lay between them! Ah, in how many cases the stony heart lies between a soul and God's boundless peace! He has pro- mised to remove it for Jesus' sake, but we will not ask, and so our life winds off in its own deso- late way to ruin. Lives that began in the same family, school, or neighborhood, under the same influences, have such different endings! It is always this rock of self-will that divides them. We cannot remove it, but we can ask God to do it, and He has promised to save all those who come to Him in Jesus' name. The school has closed and the teachers gather in groups to talk of the events of the day and of   AiFTEIR MANY DAYS,      253 their own fears and hopes in reference to their classes. Every one has something to say to the beloved Superintendent, some incident to relate, some converted pupil to rejoice over, some care- less one for whom to plan new modes of interest- ing, or some absent one to be visited and re- claimed. "Did you recognize my new scholar to-day?" Mrs. Rushton asked John Bennett.  "It was Mary Miller, your old friend Tommy's sister." "Didn't she go West with the family?"John asked. "Oh no, she remained here at service with Mrs. Hope, in Walnut St. But though I called to see her two or three times, for her mother's sake, I could never get her to promise to come to Sunday-school. She thought she was too old." "Well, how is it she is here now? She has not grown any younger, certainly," said Mr. Rushton. "Oh, you know this new class of mine did that. I thought if I could form an adult class of young women, I could get some of those girls. That was my plan when I gave up my class to Mrs. King, and began again with only Jane 22   254     TOM MILLER; OR, Brown and Susan Ellis. You know they are both good zealous Christian girls, and by their help and influence I have now ten new pupils, nearly all of them won by the idea of an adult class, for the purpose of conversing of religious things. "Do you think you will be able to keep Mary? You know they were always so unsteady at school," said John, doubtfully. ' I can try. It is something to get her here, and she seemed pleased and interested." "Did you ask her about her mother and Tommy, mamma?" said Gertie. "Yes, but she has not heard for a long time. She says that Katy wrote to her a year ago that they had left St. Louis and gone into the coun- try." "Katy could not write when they went away," said Gertie. "Perhaps she has learned, or else got some one to write for her. Mary cannot write either, and I suppose they get news from each other very seldom." "This reminds me," said Mr. Rushton, "of something I meant to have told you last week. I   \AFTER MANY DAYS.       255 saw a gentleman from St. Louis on Tuesday, who was connected with the Sunday-school of the church to which Mrs. Miller went. He gave me quite a detailed account of the family while resid- ing there. The older boys are both married. Thomas has been a clerk or bar-tender in two or three of the lowest groggeries in the city, and had become a very bad boy. They could not succeed in getting him to Sunday-school or church. He was utterly indifferent and hardened to anything on the subject of religion." "What did he say of Mrs. Miller?" asked Mrs. Rushton anxiously. "I should think she was the same patient, lovely Christian as ever; silently working and praying, and with-no more to encourage, in fact much more to discourage, than ever." "I can never forget that night I stayed with Thomas when we were little boys," said John Bennett. "He was so distressed on account of his sins and seemed so near real conversion. I was perfectly indifferent then, though I could not help being impressed by the solemnity of the scene-he so overpowered and agonized at the view of God's wrath and justice, and his   256     TOM MLLERj  ; OR, mother, in the darkness of midnight, pleading and presenting Jesus as his only Saviour. Long afterwards, when the Holy Spirit moved my heart to conviction of sin, every word she had uttered came back to me and helped me to find and accept the Saviour. I shall never forget Mrs. Miller, for I believe it was her influence in getting me to the school, and her words that night that saved me." i Thank God she will have one star in her crown!" said Mrs. Rushton. "I think I never knew such faith and patience as hers. For years she has been waiting for the salvation of her chil- dren and husband, and not one has ever yet given any evidence of a desire to come to the Saviour, except Tommy, and he turned back to greater guilt than before." ' You must do all you can for Mary, mamma," Gertie said with tears in her eyes. "May be, now that her mother is gone, she will be softened by the remembrance of her prayers and tears for her children." "And we must remember that the end is not yet," added Mr. Rushton. "Nothing is impossi- ble with God. She may live to see them all   AFUTER MAWNY DAYS.      257 gathered into the fold. But come, it is getting late. John, you will go home with us to dinner, will you not? I want to talk with you about those Atley boys. They have so much of ridi- cule and insult to bear in the shop where they work, that we must watch very carefully lest their faith be shaken." So they left the school-room and passed up Eleventh St. toward Spruce, Mr.. Rushton and John walking in advance still talking earnestly of the school, while Gertie by her mother's side was revealing all her little anxieties and trials in teaching her little ones, and receiving advice and ,suggestions as to future effort. What sight is more beautiful than that of a group of faithful teachers counselling together over the interests of a Sabbath-school? No selfish thought, no mercenary plans have induced their zeal and enthusiasm, their faith and hope. It is the true spirit of Jesus that a6tuates each heart. In its conception, in its progress, in the character of the effort demanded, the Sunday-school work is one of the noblest to which Christianity has given birth, and while it goes on prosperously throughout the length and breadth of our land, 22 *   258     TOM MLLE  R; OR, pure and undefiled religion cannot be a rare thing. There are, no doubt, teachers who do not merit such wealth of encomium, but there are, on the other hand, thousands who do, of whom the world knows not. Arrived at home, Gertie Rushton went to her room, and as soon as her bonnet was laid aside, took out her little Sunday-school journal, and sat down to enter in it the events, the encouragements, the fears, the thoughts of the session. Her mother had taught her that this was a great aid to the teacher, and she carefully followed her advice in this as in other details of the life she was just beginning-that of an earnest, Christian woman. Very sweet and lovely was Gertie's face as she sat there by her little table intent upon her record. Holy, tender thoughts were her companions, for her heart was full of love for Jesus and a desire to labor for the salvation of souls. Her hair still hung in ringlets over her shoulders, her eyes were as blue, and as gentle in expression, as on the day when she sat pleading with little Tommy Miller to come to Sunday-school. Her face was just rounding into the fair sweetness of girlhood, her   AFTER MATNY DAYS.      259 lips and cheeks just tinged with rose-buds from the exercise of her walk. A beautiful girl she promised to be, as she passed into womanhood, and she was amiable as beautiful, and brilliant in intellect as in goodness. But to those who knew her best the greatest charm about her was her pure faith in the Saviour, her sweet trust in His love, her faithful effort to walk daily in His com- mands, and to bring others to a knowledge of the dear Redeemer through whom only they can be saved.   \ XV.

Unutterably blind, they will not see the angel that folds its white wings by their fireside. They brush roughly against it, they turn coldly from it, until the white wings droop and the angel fades away for- ever!" HE autumn following Thomas's recovery was very cold, damp and unhealthy, and a fearful malarious fever broke out and raged in nearly every house for miles around.   At Mr. Miller's house they all remained well, but the families of his sons were not so fortunate.  At John's, where there were now two children, the mother and both her little ones were stricken in one day with the fever. Samuel's baby, too, lay very sick, and its mother watched constantly over its cradle for many days. So there was no one to depend upon for help at 260   AFTER MANIY DAYS.      261 John's but his mother. The houses stood about half a mile apart, and the ground between had always been low and moist. Under the effect of the long-continued rains of this fall it had become very wet and swampy, and almost impassable. "Here comes mother, Hetty," said John, as he stood in the door looking out, on the third morn- ing after his wife and children had been taken ill. He had been up nearly all night taking care of them. Hetty was feeling some better, but the little ones were worse. "I didn't think she would come so early this morning," Hetty said; "she staid all day yester- day, you know. 'She is so good to us in our trouble, John; what should we do without her?" Mrs. Miller came up to the door just then, and John stepped aside to let her pass in. She went at once to the bed to see how the patients were. "Your feet are wet, mother," John said, kindly, you will take cold." "Yes, I know it, John, they are very wet. But I will change my shoes and stockings at once and not take cold. The water is above shoe-tops now, and the rain not over." She sat down by the stove, remioved her wet shoes, and put on   262     TOM MTTT,ER; OR, some dry woollen hose and a pair of home-made slippers which she had brought in her hand. "Now they are warm and comfortable," she said, putting the wet ones where they would dry. "It's too much for you, mother, coming over here every day," said Hetty; "I am sure I don't know what we would do without you, but yet you oughtn't to come." "What's father and Tom doin' to-day?" asked  John.  I can't do a thing on my land; it's so wet that 'tan't safe to walk in most places." ", They are getting the last of the potatoes in" said Mrs. Miller. "'Our land lies a little higher than yours, you know, and they said they could just manage to dig them if the rain held off to-day." "Who is to get 'em their dinner?" said Hetty, "I am sure you can't go back to-day." '"I could go back well enough, but I don't want to leave you, till night. There is some washing to be done here to-day. But I've left things so that Thomas can finish getting the din- ner for his father and himself. I was up at four o'clock to get their meals ready, all but boiling the kettle, and setting it on the table." Mrs. Miller. took up the baby as she spoke and   AFITER, MANY DAYS.      263 fed and soothed it, and then the other child began to cry and had to be taken up and fed also. It was nearly an hour before they were both quiet again, and then there was their mother to take care of. John helped what he could, building the fires and bringing water, but he knew very little about making himself useful in the house. When she had made some tea and a piece of toast for the sick woman, and given them all another dose of the medicine the doctor had left, she began to prepare for the washing, which with the attention she was obliged to give the sick ones, and getting the dinner for John, took her until nearly six o'clock. Then she made them as comfortable as she could for the night, showed Johnuwhere the gruel was for their drink, and what medicine to give until she came again. "I'll be over as early as I can in the morning," she said, "the doctor will be coming pretty early, for this is 'most the beginning of his rounds, and there are so many sick on the prairie." "I am sorry to have you do so much, mother, and the water so bad between us. I'm afraid you'll get sick too," said Hetty Miller, really grateful now to the kind mother she had often   264     TOM MLL^R; OR, thought tiresome and over particular. Even John, though he had a great deal of his father's gruffness and want of tender sympathy, felt touched as he thought of the last three days, and insisted on her putting his boots over her shoes for the walk home. "Now take good care of the little ones and Hetty," she said to John, "and I hope the doctor will say they are better when he comes to- morrow." Slowly and wearily she made her way home, the heavy boots making the walk still more toil- some; but they did prevent her getting her feet wet, though she was -more tired than usual from their weight and from the washing she had done. Thomas had built the fire and put some potatoes to boil for their supper. She attempted to finish it after she had made her feet warm, but was obliged to sit down again by the stove, pale and faint. "You won't stand it to go over to John's this way every day, mother," said Tommy. "You a'n't strong enough for it, and you'll get sick yourself. Let me set the table and make the tea.",    The Prairie Home. Chap. XV,     AFiTEU MAsirNY DAYS.     265 "You may do it, if you have a mind, Thomas," she said, "and cut some slices of pork off the piece in the crock, to fry." By the time that supper was ready Mrs. Miller felt better, and the tea revived her still more. ' Now you look a little more like living," said Thomas, "you begin to look comfortable, mother." "Your mother don't look so strong as some women, but she'll stand as much as any of 'em," said Mr. Miller, scarcely looking at his wife as he spoke. "She's worth more now than Hetty or Margaret, if she is growin' old." And feeiing that he had said a Very flattering and kind thing, he began to talk about some pigs he was going to sell to Cunningham, not even thinking to ask after the sick at John's. But Thomas could nqt help noticing that his mother continued to look pale all the evening, and he knew she was not so strong as his father believed her to be. And for the first time in his life he began to think seriously as to what his feelings would be if she were to be taken away from them by death. Thomas truly loved his mother, and whatever of love and tenderness was in his nature welled up at that painful thought. 23 , /    266     TOM MLLER; OR, Yet it was too painful to be long indulged, and he put it away with a strong effort. These three days were but the beginning of the hardships which that autumn of sickness and death brought to Mrs. Miller. For six long weeks she scarcely missed a day of going either to John's or Samuel's to take care of. the sick, after doing her own work at home. Through all the storms of wind and rain, away into the dreary November days, still she toiled on under the burdens of the two, and sometimes three, house- holds. When the winter days were come health again returned to the pale and wasted ones who had escaped death from the malignant fever. John's eldest child had died, and they had buried her one wild, blustering day with only a prayer from a pious neighbor, making the little grave under one of the oak-trees on the edge of the farm. When the necessity for constant effort was over, and the pressure a little removed from her bur- dened head and hands and heart, Mrs. Miller began to show unmistakable signs of weakness, and a degree of fragility never before seen in her, delicate as she had always looked.   AFTER, MANY DAYS.      267 Thomas was, however, the only one who really saw that this was the case. "Mother, is begin- ning to fail," he said to himself as he looked across the table at her while he sat at dinner one day; " her face is so pale, and the wrinkles are growing deeper. Then she walks so slowly and painfully, and her voice sounds weak. 'I wish father would see it and have the doctor for her." But Mr. Miller did not see it. He was'glad and satisfied to have her at home again, for he appre- ciated the careful housekeeping and well-cooked, neatly served meals. He would not have per- mitted her to go to nurse the sick, only that they had been his own sons' families. But the restric- tion of her labors to her own home would have been on his account, not hers, and made with a view to his own comfort and convenience. As long as there was no change in the house and she went on her daily round of duty, it was not likely that he would be quick to notice the change in her look and manner. But she was failing. She felt it in her own consciousness more and more from day to day all that winter. More and more the glories and joys of heaven uwere present to her thoughts, and   earthly hopes and anxieties faded into a sweet resignation. Her eyes, which had ever been beautiful with the radiance of a heart at peace with God, now kindled into rapturous loveliness with the sweetness and preciousness of hr trust and faith. In that rough log-cabin, wearily and painfully often, going about the most common and laborious details of its housekeeping, a soul drawing near eternity held sweet communion with its Maker, and felt that the walls of that humble earthly home were as the very gate of heaven. Thomas dimly appreciated these things at the time, though he tried not to think about them. As for the rest it was with them as with the dis- ciples who ate with their Lord after the resurrec- tion; afterwards they remembered how her face had been as the face of an angel, and that their hearts had burned within them, but then they saw not nor dreamed how surely she was hastening to her God. Her few daily words of advice, exhor- tation and entreaty had long fallen as the good seed among thorns, producing very little visible effect. It has been mentioned that she had always some place for secret prayer to which she resorted three times daily for communion with her Saviour.   AF TER MXANY DAYS.      269 Little as Thomas had treasured in his heart of the teachings of the Bible, he could not help thinking, as he saw his mother seeking her closet from day to day, of what he had read at Sabbath- school of the Saviour going alone into the Mount of Olives to pray. She had always a Mount of Olives, he thought, wherever they had lived; and even on their journeys, she had ever found a spot where she might be alone with God. All through that winter, noticing his mother's pale face and thin form, dimly discerning the signs of coming death, Thomas's heart grew ten- derer, and solemn impressions would force them- selves upon him at times. But he was too proud to let her know that he felt more deeply than usual. His kindness and thoughtful care touched her more than once, and she would look into his face with a questioning, yearning expression which almost brought tears to his eyes. Then he would'turn away and try to hide his emotion. The perversity of the human heart is more plainly shown in this than in perhaps anything else, that it is ashamed of its best feelings and impulses and 'endeavors to hide them, while it seems proud of sin and bold in its display. 23 e   270     TOM MLLtER; OR, Feeble as Mrs. Miller was all winter, as the spring came on she rallied and seemed to be grow- ing stronger again. She had so far done her housework with the assistance which Thomas had voluntarily given, that when the spring work began to claim his attention, she was able to go on as she always had done, seemingly, and Thomas thought her well again, and that his fears had been ungrounded. That was a very busy sum- mer with them all. Help was scarce and the crops bountiful on all the great Elk-Horn prairie. Mr. Miller and Thomas worked very hard from May to October, and were rewarded with an abundant harvest. Thomas forgot his anxiety of the previous winter, about his mother. He had become accustomed to her white face and feeble step, and as she had their meals always ready in time, and kept the house in cleanliness and order, besides milking their two cows and making the butter, there did not seem to be any cause for his forebodings. She never complained of illness, and her husband had not noticed any signs of it in her appearance. Once Thomas had said. to him, when she was looking so ill at mid-winter- "Father, don't you think the doctor ought to   A  FJTEIMn MANY DAYS.    271 come and see mother? She is not well, and I am afraid she is breaking down this winter." But Mr. Miller replied with much surprise- "Breaking down! I'd like to know what is to break her down now, when the work's lighter than common and you waitin' on her besides. I ha'n't heard her say she was sick." Don't you think she looks bad, father?" "No worse than she always did. She never made no great show o' strength, but she's able to do with the best of 'em." Thomas thought his father must have been right about it when the warm weather came and she was able to perform her usual work. Neither of them knew of the hours of suffering she endured, the weakness and faintness of the long hours when she was alone in the house. Mrs. Miller was by nature silent and' uncomplaining in personal trials. She would have been so to a great degree had she not been a Christian. But being one, her anxiety for the salvation of the souls of her rfamily made her look upon her own pain as trifling in comparison. For herself it was but a small mttter that her body was failing day by day, and she must soon be laid in the   272     TO:M MTTTRF,'; OR, grave. She was going home to God. All was bright and beautiful before her, not a doubt ever shadowed the clear skies of her hope. As her days on earth grew few, and she was conscious of the wasting of her physical power, she was anxious only to do her last work in calling her dear ones to Jesus. Daily she grew more resigned to leaving them in God's hands, even unreconciled as they were. "Not my way, but Thine, my Father," she said one night, as she knelt in prayer at the twilight hour in the little garret closet, to which she climbed with weary .limbs after the day's toil. "Not my will, but Thine. Thy ways are not as my ways, nor Thy thoughts as my thoughts! Thou seest all my children's hearts! Thou knowest all their needs! Save them in Thine own time and way, and oh, make me will- ing to wait for Thy salvation, and trust Thee in what my eyes may not see!" The next morning was a clear, cool and bright one in October. The family had risen early, as was their habit. Mr. Miller was in the stable feeding his oxen and a horse he had lately pur- chased, that they might be ready for the day's work at hauling the loads of yellow corn-ears to   AFTERt MANY DAYS.      273 the new granary beside the house. Thomas was chopping wood near the door, his usual work be- fore breakfast. Mrs. Miller had put the potatoes to boiling and cut the slices of pork to fry for the morning meal. The table, too, was set, its coarse but white cloth and neat arrangement giving a tempting look to the brown bread and butter and dish of stewed apples upon it. The sun had just risen above the horizon as the mother stepped to the door, with the milking-pail in her hand. She stopped a moment to look at the scene before her-of their neat fields smiling under the early sun, with an aspect of self-congratulation at hav- ing done their best in the, past summer. There was poetic appreciation as well as satisfaction and thankfulness in the emotion which swelled her heart at that moment. The words of the "Sweet Singer of Israel" were all she knew of pbetry, and softly repeating to herself, "Oh Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches," she went oif to where the cows were waiting to be 'milked beside the stable. "It's a finemorning, mother," Thomas said as she passed him, "and if the weather continues   274     rOM: MTTT IR; OR, so pleasant we shall get in the last of our corn to-day." She smiled in reply, one of those smiles which Thomas had always loved, they said so much, and he continued his chopping. Scarcely five minutes had passed after this greeting when a faint scream was heard ly both Mr. Miller within the stable, and Thomas at his chopping. The latter was the first to see what had happened. One of the cows, a new and unruly animal, had kicked Mrs. Miller in the side, and she lay on the ground bleeding and insensible. "Oh, mother, mother!" he groaned as he hur- ried to her side. "Father, mother is dead I she is dead!"Mr. Miller also was, for once in his life, really alarmed. His wife lay dead, to all appear- ance, and in the first moment that he gazed upon her more of feeling thrilled his heart than ever before. The blood came from a wound near her temple made by a sharp stone upon which her head had fallen. The father and son raised her and carried her to the house. Just as they crossed its threshold she opened her eyes and a groan of agony escaped   ATij k';+ K MANY3ss JDAYS. 275 her lips. They laid her on the bed as gently as possible. "Where are you hurt, mother?" asked Tommy, bending over her. She could not speak, but pointed to her side, and they knew the wound on her head was not all. "Saddle the horse and ride to Sparta for the doctor as quick as you .can, Tom!"Mr. Miller said, and his voice was so strange, so husky with grief that his wife gave a quick glance and one of her sweet, meaning smiles as she heard it. It was sweet even in her agony to know that she was loved by him after all the indifference and coldness of these many years, and she felt that the touch of remorseful tenderness in that tone did spring from love, though long dormant. Thomas needed no second bidding. He was dashing away over the prairie in less than five minutes, and Mr. Miller was left alone with his dying wife. She was still speechless, but he saw that she was conscious. He brought cold water and bathed the hurt on her forehead which though it bled profusely, was not deep. His hands were awkward at such offices, and now they trembled   276     TOM MLLER; OR, with fright and grief. Samuel Miller had loved, did love his wife, strangely as his conduct had corresponded with such a statement. He had a cold, undemonstrative temperament, was fond of money and property, and possessed little appre- ciation for refined feeling or sympathy for any trouble not 'outward and visible. But underneath all the stony exterior of his na- ture, which his wife's gentle goodness could not melt, he had a heart which this shock, sudden and horrible, had reached. Sitting there beside her,. expecting each breath to be the last, he realized how very much dearer than land or money she was to him. He felt what a blank would be left in his life if that meek face might never more be seen in his home. The depths of his nature were broken up by the sudden whirl- wind of calamity, though they had been inacces- sible to the still small voice of daily example and entreaty. She was groaning now with every breath. He knew that her ribs were some of them broken, from the slight examination he had made of her side, but there was nothing he could do but to sit and watch her agony.  He had never looked   upon the death of any one, but he felt that she was dying. It was many years since a tear had stained his cheek, but as he sat there great sobs shook his broad chest, and the tears rolled down his face unchecked. Once he cried aloud in his great fear and terror, and she opened her eyes again with that strange, sweet smile, and spoke for the first time. He bent down to catch the words. "lMy life could not bring you to love Jesus," she said, faintly, "may be my death will make you see Him-'- 24   XVI. THEr DYING .  OTB1GER. "- We may not prize the active worth Of those who, day by day, Tread with us on this toilsome earth, Its devious, stormy way: But charms deep, hallowed and profound, By purer feeling led, Our hearts must ever cast around aS*     The memory of the, dead." THE time seemed to Mr. Miller to pass very slowly as he sat waiting for the doctor. He dared not leave his wife long enough to go to John or Samuel's to tell them what had hap- pened. Some of them came in nearly every day, however, and he still kept hoping for them now. But nine and then ten o'clock came, and left him alone beside the sufferer. She had spoken only once or twice and then with great difficulty. At half-past ten he walked to the door to see if some one was not in sight, as he had done many times 278   AFTiR CMANY DAYS.       279 before, but no one appeared. What a mockery the bright October day was to his heart! lie turned back into the house. The table still stood as she had set it for breakfast, and he took a piece of bread, feeling faint with hunger. How cheer- less and desolate the preparations for breakfast looked now. Grief and self-reproach were busy with the heart so long filled with selfish coldness. " oughtn't to have let her milk, anyhow," he muttered, "she wasn't able. But it's too late now!"  Alas, how often our kindness is "too late!" All this time Mrs. Miller lay, evidently in ter- rible pain, yet with patient, even joyful serenity shining from her face. Her eyes, whenever she opened them, were fixed upon her husband. She was reading, pitying, yet rejoicing in, his feelings. Oh, those hours of lonely watching and waiting were something new to Samuel Miller. He could not himself understand the flood of bitter memo- ries that rushed over his soul as he met again and again the look of her expressive eyes. He had, in his own hard, undemonstrative waqy, loved his wife, and really thought her superior to those of his neighbors. He had too, a sort of a pride in   her goodness and gentleness, but now, now that: she was dying and leaving him forever, he saw, very dimly perhaps, but still clearly enough to appall even his stout, hard heart, what her life had been, and what he had made it. Words which had scarcely found an echo in his heart, words which she had spoken years before, came thronging and ringing through his brain. The wretched man sat by her bedside with his head bowed upon his hands, listening to her stifled groans, until overcome with the sense of his un- kindness and guilt at last, he threw himself upon his knees at her side and caught her left hand, the only one she could move. "Oh Jane, you must not die without forgiving me!" he said. "I have been a cruel husband to you! Say you forgive me, Jane, for the sake of our old days in Ireland! You've been an angel to me, Jane, and I've been hard and harsh! For- give me, oh, my wife, forgive me!" She looked up again, that mysterious, tender, holy smile still breaking over her whole face. "I do forgive, Samuel, God knows I never thought. you meant me ill! But, oh, Sammy, you remem- ber how you loved me when we were married;   2..J'J' ' .Lt- X.,.( Jl. ll Y. aJ t .JL . J'.. . It you must meet me in heaven, Samuel!, Jesus will forgive; ask him!"And again her voice refused utterance, but her finger still pointed up- ward, and the beaming smile spoke of unutterable peace and joy, Her last night's prayer came back to her. She had asked for "God's way," not her own, to bring her dear ones to the cross. Perhaps this event was God's way, and her hus- band was even now coming, through her suffer- ings, to the light. Her anxiety and trouble were all gone. She was willing to leave,them in God's hands, and go home, knowing that He would do what was best for them. She had "done what she could." About twelve o'clock Mr. Miller heard foot- steps approaching, and soon Samuel entered the room,having come on some errand. He was very much shocked when his father told him what had happened. Sudden death has always greater terrors for the unconverted than lingering disso- lution. If Mrs. Miller had been taken sick and slowly wasted away to death they might none of them have been so much affected. But the shock of the sudden and cruel accident broke up the frozen, sluggish current of their natures, and re- 24 -a   zOz ,   TOMA: ITTrTrI-'FM; OR, vealed depths of feeling which even they had never realized as belonging to them. "She is not dead now, is she, father?"Samuel asked tremulously, bending over the bed, her white face and motionless form striking a chill to his heart. As the mother lay there, her earthly labor done, her sn felt something of what she had been to him, and his hot tears fell upon her wasted hands. She looked up into his face with the same serene, holy faith shining from every feature, that had marked her expression during all the morning. "Is it you, Samuel?" she said, faintly. "I am glad you came to see me. I am going home soon, my son; you must bring Margaret and John and Hetty and the children over to bid me good-bye." "Oh, mother, perhaps the doctor will help you; he will come now very soon. Maybe you will get well again. Don't talk about dying?" She shook her head a little. "No, no, Samuel, I  am going to Jesus. I should have gone very soon, if this had not hap- pened. Call them all, quick-," and again the   A FTERI MANXY DAYS.     283 sharp agony prevented her voice from being audible. After a few minutes she looked toward her husband, and whispered, "I forgot my pain and slept a few moments before Samuel came. I thought I was in heaven, and you all came,-not one was left. Oh, how sweet! You will come to Jesus and be saved when I am gone?" "You must not die, Jane, you must live and let me be kind to you! You have worked so hard; I ought to have saved you from it. I thought of nothing but the farm!", And the strong man wept lile a little child over that small, prostrate form, which he had so long allowed to bear the burdens and hardships of life without sympathy, or help from a loving word or act. "Tom and the doctor have come," said Samuel, as two tired and heated horses were reined up at the door. Not stopping to speak to father or son, Dr. Todd began at once to examine the injuries of his patient, his face growing more and more grave as he did so.. "Where is your wife?" he asked at last, turn-   284     TOM MTT TVTi:R; OR, ing suddenly to Samuel. "Bring her at once. Stop at John's and tell them to come over here." Samuel hastened away, not daring to disobey, though he wanted to know the doctor's opinion of his mother before he went.  "Give that youngster," pointing to Tom, who sat exhausted by the stove with his head leaning against the rudie chimney, "give that youngster something to eat. He's ridden over thirty miles without a mouthful. We want no more sickness here." Mr. Miller also did the bidding of the bluff doctor at once. "Now can you," looking keenly at the husband as he came back to the bedside, "can you help me during the operation that must be performed? I ought not to wait until the women come. She may die first. At any rate the suffering is wear- ing her out and decreasing her chances." It was a new spirit in Samuel Miller's heart which prompted that low but firm reply, "I will do anything you wish, Dr. Todd." "Good. I' see you are able to do it." And the doctor gave his orders for what he desired and went at once to work. Excruciatingly painful as the next half hour   AAFTER MANY DAYS.       285 was, Mrs. Miller passed through it with no expression of her agony but her stifled moans and half audible prayers for the presence and help of Jesus. She had not yet spoken to the doctor. She was assured in her own mind that she must die, and submitted to the operation only to satisfy him and them that all was done that could be. It Was only after it was all over and she lay exhausted and fainting, but less agonized with pain that Mr. Miller ventured to put the question which had been on his lips ever since the doctor came: "Can she live, doctor?" He had followed the physician to the door, out of her hearing. "Shy can never get well, Mr. Miller." But she will not die to-day-she seems better, you can save her, doctor?"The unhappy man spoke pleadingly. "She may live a few days, perhaps with the greatest care a few weeks. Her mind is calm, her heart at rest, or she would have died at once."   '  "Oh doctor, she must not die! I can't spare her!" x   1(}    TOM MLLER; OR, The doctor looked at him sharply; he had never liked him much, and had not believed the man could feel like this. "She's been dying this year past," he said, briefly, "it has only come a little sooner. What-' ever you've got to do for her, or say to her, had better be attended to." "I've been a hard, cruel, selfish man to her, doctor," said the softened man, humbly. "I don't blame you that you speak sharp to me. But what I can do to make up for it I will." "I can do no more for her to-day," said the physician, with a little more sympathy in his tone. "I shall be by here to-morrow and will see her before noon. Let nobody disturb or excite her, though that won't be easy to do. She's got the true anodyne for a trying hour. If more of my patients had her calmness and peace they'd be more likely to live, as well as more prepared to die. She may go any time, but I won't be surprised if she lives a month." He had got upon his horse as he spoke and now rode away. Those were not idle words of Mr. Miller's when he said he would do what he could to atone   A"t'i=  MAX YAN Y DAYS.  287 for his past neglect and coldness. He knew how often the mother's heart had yearned to see all her children together once more, and this was his first thought as he went back to her bed. "Wouldn't you like to see Ann and Mary and Robert, Jane?" he asked as he bent over her. The mother's eyes unclosed with a swift eager- ness which showed how deep the words had gone. "Robert, and Mary are coming in the spring; you know he said he had better not come this fall. But tell them to meet me there," she said, pointing upward. "Robert and Mary shall come this fall," he said hurriedly. "Robert said he would do as I said about it, and I shall tell him to come now. Cunningham is going to Philadelphia after his mother, and I can send wovd by him, to-morrow, and not wait for a letter to go. Don't you think Ann could come with them?" "Her husband is poor-I am afraid she hasn't money to come with." "I will send the money. You know I've laid by for a new wagon and harness and another horse. Oh mother, you shall live to see all your   288     TOIM MLILER,; OR, children again before you die! I'll do that much at any rate!" "God be praised for your kindness, Samuel. You have been so good to me to-day, and now this is s'tch good news." The stimulants the doctor had given, and the absence of the acute pain from which she had suffered all the morning, made her voice stronger, and her face more natural than it had been before. Thomas stood at the foot of the bed, wondering so much at the change in his father as almost to forget his grief and terror over his mother's in- juries. The morning had been a fearful one to him. The long, lonely ride had been full of bitter memories and sad reflections. But now, seeing the change in her face, he felt new hope  for her, and spoke for the first time since his  return. "Mother is certainly better, father; didn't the doctor say she would be better? How soon can Robert and the girls get here?" His thoughts going back to the strangeness of his father's new manner and look. "In less than three weeks, if they start as soon as Cunningham sees them. They ha'n't got to   AFITER MA NY DAYS.      289 come all the way as we did. The river is high and there are railroads half the way here now." "To think that I shall see them!"Mrs. Miller said. "It seems too good to believe. I thank you so much, Samuel, for doing it." She looked up to him so tenderly that the old man bent down and kissed her lips for the first time in years. Both the other families now came in, and had not the mother's serenity been founded in divine strength, the doctor's directions that she be kept quiet and undisturbed would have availed little in the general tumult of their excitement and grief. Hetty installed herself as nurse and house- keeper. Margaret took both the children home with her at night, that there might be no unne- cessary noise, and thus an arrangement was begun that continued for three weeks, at the end of which the children from Philadelphia arrived. Mrs. Miller lay with but little change from day to day, always cheerful and patient, but still the  doctor gave no hope of her recovery. Her hus- band, though less demonstrative than at first, was still kind and thoughtful. It was a new life to 25   290     TOM MILLER; OR, the poor, weary little woman to be thus loved and tended by all about her, and sometimes she felt happier than ever before in her life in spite of her pain and weakness. She was very glad to welcome her older children, but there was no change in her, no more hope. She never talked to any of them personally now of religion. She seemed to have left it all to Jesus, and to feel that there was no more that she could do. Ann and Mary took charge of their father's house after their arrival, Robert remained there also, as his wife and children were yet in Philadelphia, and the whole family gradually took its character more and more from that of the helpless, patient wife and mother, whose every day among them might be the last. Perfect peace and joy shone from her face continually, but she spoke very little to any member of the family, except to thank them for kindness and attention. I do not think she herself understood this great peace and calmness that had settled down upon her soul. There was no evidence of the conversion of one of the family to Jesus. There was still as much reason for solicitude on her part as ever. But she did not feel it. She could only   AF'TERI MANY DAYS.      291 say and feel with a deep, overwhelming, joyful sense of its blessedness, "Thy will be done." The physician had said she might live a month. Week after week went by until more than three months had passed since- she was hurt, and still she lingered with them. It was now mid-winter and the snow lay deep over the vast prairie, and weighed heavily upon the oak branches in the forests. One night she seemed better and stronger, and calling Ann to her bedside said she wanted to be lifted up and placed in the large chair by the chimney-corner, where she had always sat with her knitting in the winter evenings. "I feel so well to-night," she said, "and John and Samuel and their folks are coming over, you know. I want to sit there once with all of you around me." Katy had come from St. Louis a few days before for a holi- day visit, and they were all together now. "Are you sure you can stand it, mother?" Katy and Mary both asked, coming up joyfully. "How good it will seem!" continued Mary. "I believe mother is really getting well. Doctors don't always know, I've heard Mr. Rushton say."   292     TOM MLLER; OR, They bustled about with more cheerfulness than had been exhibited there for a long time, and soon had her bolstered up in the chair in the chimney-corner, as she had desired. Mr. Miller and Robert first came? in, and were as much pleased and surprised as the girls had expected. Then Thomas, now as large as any of his bro- thers, came from the stable, and started forward joyfully at the unusual sight. John and Samuel, Margaret and Hetty and all the little ones soon followed. Ann's two children were kept at John's, lest their noise should weary the sick grand- mother. The room was full when they were all gathered in, and they seemed very glad at seeing their mother up once more. Still there was something so unearthly in her steadfast, solemn eyes, such a touching sweetness in her smile as she welcomed them all, such a brightness on her brow as she sat with them, that they could not talk and laugh loudly, or speak of their work, their cattle and horses as usual. It was not long before almost perfect silence reigned in the room, and all eyes and thoughts seem to be turned towards the pale invalid in her favorite corners, with emotions not easily expressed   AFVTER MAANY DAYS:      293 in words. Each face seemed softened and spirit- ualized by an influence from that quiet figure, until you would not have recognized them as the hard, worldly faces of Samuel Miller and his children. It needs a hard and sudden stroke to rend a rock, and such a stroke had the mother's accident been to them. In the midst of the still- ness she spoke, her voice clearer than before since her illness: "Samuel, my dear husband, come here and sit at my side. You all think I am better to-night, but I feel that I am dying! Don't speak to me; I must talk while I can. I have waited long, but I am going now, very soon." They all tried to interrupt her with assurances that she was better, certainly better. "No," she said, "my time is come. It is not hard to die, but I must, oh, I must see you all there, when I get home. My husband, promise me that you will come. You know the way. 'Jesus said, I am the way,'-read that, and ask Jesus to help you to go to God for forgiveness and salvation. Oh, Samuel, I have waited so long for you, and now I must go alone. But you will come." She paused a moment, but not from 25    294     TOMo MXILLER; OR, weakness, for her voice sounded clearer and stronger as she went on. "It seems such a great mercy that Jesus forgave me and blessed me. And my heart has been so happy ever since, only when I thought of my husband and my children. I wanted you all to know Him and be saved. It seems long when I think how I have prayed and waited for you. Must I go without one of you? Must I tell my Saviour that you would not come? It can't be-no, no,-it can't be! You know you are sinners-you all know it; you know the Bible says, 'There is none other name given under heaven or among men whereby we must be saved,' but the name of Jesus, and 'He is able to save unto the uttermost all who come unto God by Him.' He died for you,-oh, how many times I have told you that! Ton't you believe in Him? Robert, my first boy, come and sit by your father. Your mother is saying her last words to you and they are these:-' Pray to God for Jesus' sake to make you willing to serve him."' Robert took her hand and knelt before her. She stooped and kissed him. "Bring your wife and children to meet me in heaven," she whispered as he burst into tears. Ann came next.   AFTER MANSY DAYS.      295 She was growing very much like her mother in looks as she grew older. She threw herself sob- bing on the floor beside the chair, and kissed her hands over and over. "You, too, my daughter, oh, why won't you come to Jesus? Oh, if I could but leave you all Christians, I could die so easy!" "I will come, mother, God; helping me! I am a lost sinner. I don't know how he can ever for- give me, but I will go to your Saviour!" All in the room were weeping now. Religion seemed another thing-so real-so important, when death calne. "Oh mother," it was Katy who spoke now, "take me with you! I can't find the way to heaven when you are gone!" "Jesus is the way. Just go to Jesus and ask Him to help you." "I am so wicked," sobbed Katy, "God will punish me; I cannot speak to Him!" "He says He will not cast out those that Jesus brings. Put your hand in His, and you may go safely." I will, mother, I will!" "Yes, mother, and I too!" and Samuel also   296     TOM r MiLER; OR, was kneeling before her, with a broken heart and streaming eyes. "Oh God, I thank Thee! Here are three of my children at Thy feet at last! John, Mary, Tommy and Robert-four more-will you stay behind?"They were weeping bitterly, but made no reply. "Oh, Samuel," turning once more to her husband, "will not you come too? Now, while He is waiting. When the angeis come for me let them carry the news that you are all coming!" I'll try, Jane, I'll try to do as you bid me," was all he could say. The other children re- mained silent, but crowded near her, sobbing. One by one she took them by the hand and ten- derly kissed them. "Now kneel down all of you, while I ask God to bring you all to see my face in heaven. Tommy, my youngest boy, come here close by my side. You have been very near to God, my son. He has made you feel your sins. Why will you refuse to give Him your heart? Your mother is going now, Tommy; will you not try to meet me? You know the way!" They all knelt around her. It was a solemn scene in the little log-house that winter night.   AFVTER MANY DA-YS.       297 Impressed by her words and manner, they all felt that she was dying. Ever since that terrible day on which she was hurt, their hearts had been, yielding slowly, secretly, to the influence of her life. Had she talked much to them since that day, Satan might have rallied selfish feelings of resentment to his aid, and still kept his rule over their souls; but with her lying there silently as a reminder, and remorse once aroused by the start- ling shock, ceaselessly knocking at their hearts with records of sin against God and thoughtless neglect of one of the most devoted of mothers, the stout bulwarks of self-will had yielded with some of them, and they were ready to " become as little children." But, alas! Thomas was not one of these. Grieving bitterly as he did at his mother's danger, he had too many times rejected Christ and hard- ened his heart against His offers of mercy. It seemed now as if he could not feel any desire for salvation, but only a selfish grief at his mother's loss. The prayer of the dying woman over her family was the outpouring of a faith that would not be denied, and she pleaded with tears and   298      TOM MLZIER. cries that they all might be brought to the foot of the cross until exhaustion forced her to be silent. It was her last strength. When they had risen from their knees she was speechless and fainting. They carried her back to the bed and all watched around it till dawn, when without farther word or sign she breathed her last. But three forgiveo sinners-Ann, Katy and Samuel, knelt around that dying bed. They had given their hearts to Jesus and found acceptance with their heavenly Father through the blood of Jesus Christ His dear Son.   XVII. ," Knowledge by suffering entereth,; And Life is perfected by Death!" THE funeral of Mrs. Miller was held on the next day but one after her death. The min- ister whose preaching she had attended at the school-house on the prairie was invited to conduct the service. She was to be buried in a new lot which had been fenced and set apart for a bury- ing-ground during the fearful sickness of the pre- ceding year; and as this was four miles away, the service was necessarily short. But the neighbors for miles around followed her to the grave. She was loved and respected by all, and her sad acci- dent and long illness had touched many hearts with sympathy. Not only this, but the Christian faith, the Divine presence, that had sustained her were seen and recognized by many thoughtful 299   Uvv     TOM MTT,TTIR; OR, hearts outside of her own home. Religious feeling began to prevail upon the prairie, and much of theo influence at work might have been traced to the bedside of that silent, patient woman waiting for her appointed time. It was a clear, cold day, when the snow lay three feet deep over all the ground, that they left her to rest beneath it, and the large family of mourners returned to their desolate home at sunset. Changes had soon to be made. They had all remained waiting at their father's house until now. Robert had come West with the intention of settling near his father and brothers, but had left his family at the old home until the new one was prepared. He selected a tract of land two miles beyond Samuel's place, and stayed with this brother while building his house. Ann was to remain until spring and then return to her hus- band in Philadelphia. She brought her children home to her father's house, and kept it for him and Thomas while she stayed. Mary returned to St. Louis with Katy, to find a place for herself at service. Thomas missed and grieved for his mother, but it was with a rebellions, repining spirit. He was   A1'fcLkc MA NY xDAyS.     301 as bitterly opposed as ever to the thought of yielding to her prayer, and seeking the Saviour. Ann was now a Christian, trying to walk in her mother's ways, but she had not confidence to speak to her father or brother about their souls. Perhaps it would not have been of any use had she done so, for they were both in that unsatisfied, restless state of indecision, when importunity and observation from others sometimes rouses evil passions, and intercepts the work of the Spirit in "convincing and persuading."  Mr. Miller had been very much changed during all his wife's ill- ness. He was how very different from his old self. But he had not found peace in believing, and was gloomy, irritable and peevish much of the time. His hardness and cold selfishness were gone, but the broken heart was not yet healed by g the touch of the tender hand of the Great Physi- cian. As for Thomas, this trouble seemed to have driven him bfarther from God instead of drawing him nearer. His heart was fill of bitter, rebellious thoughts, and he said to himself that it was very cruel in God, if there was a God, to cause his mother so much of suffering and to take her away from her family. John was thoughtful 26    since her death, but still unrepentant and worldly. Samuel was trying to live as near to his Saviour as he could, and striving to follow his mother's example in all things pertaining to the Christian life. He had many trials and temptations, but he went in prayer to the true source of help and strength. In the spring, when Ann and her little ones went away, Mr. Miller and Thomas were left alone. Both were still unsettled and unhappy, and had lost their interest in the farm to a great degree. Perhaps it was in consequence of their unhappiness that the health of both was failing all that summer, and they were at last attacked by the great enemy of all Western settlers, chills and fever. Thomas was very sick-for some weeks, and his father too miserable in health to take care of him, or attend to the work of the farm. So in the fall, as the cool weather began to set in, they decided to rent the farm, and leave the home they had worked so hard to secure. Both felt it could never seem the same to them again as it had while the mother had been with them. Mr. Miller went to live with John during the winter, and Thomas made up his mind to return   to St. Louis as soon as he was able. It was the middle of January before he was strong enough to leave Samuel's, but when he had once com- menced getting better, he was soon quite well and able to work. On arriving in the city he visited his sisters Mary and Katy. The latter he found a joyful Christian girl, a member of the church which her mother bad attended while there, hav- ing been baptized immediately on her return from the country.  Her heart was full on seeing Thomas, and she talked long and eagerly to him of their mother's teachings and wishes, and her own happiness in the service of Christ. "Oh, Tom," she said, "if you only knew how happy it makes one to love Jesus and feel that he has pardoned one's sins! Do you remember how we talked about it, you and mother and I, that day you came so near being shot on the boat? I never could forget things that mother said on that journey, though I wouldn't heed them at the time. But when mother was dying, and I thought of Jesus who was so good to her, and would save me if I would submit to His rule, I couldn't hold out any longer. Oh,Tom, if you would only come to Jesus!"  And Katy Miller,   304     TOM TMTTin; OR, once so cold and unfeeling, wept tears of mingled grief and joy under the subduing, softening in- fluences of the Holy Spirit and the memories of her sainted mother. Thomas did not like to hear of Jesus. The name was distasteful to his heart, and after a few more words with Katy about their mother, and his father's health, he took his leave of her. His sister Mary had been very busy when he called on her in the morning, so he went again in the evening after leaving Katy. "I have just got a letter from Mrs. Rushton," were almost her first words to him; "you know I told you that Mrs. Orton wrote to her for me and informed her of mother's death, and this is the answer." "Well, what does she say?" asked Thomas; "all about religion though, I suppose, and no news." During her stay in the country Mary had told her mother and brother many things about their old neighbors, and especially concerning the great change in the Bennett family in consequence of John's becoming a Christian. "There's a good deal Doutt John Bennett in   AFT EER MA*NY DAYS.      805 it," said Mary ; "you can read it if you would like," and she laid the open letter in his hand. Thomas could not read manuscript any too readily, but he had little trouble in deciphering the plain, neat hand of Mrs. Rushton. PHLADELPHA, January 12th, 1845. "MY DEAR MARY :-I received your letter and a note from your new mistress, Mrs. Orton, yesterday. At first I thought it very strange that you had not written to me sooner, but I freely excuse you in consequence of your troubles and many changes since you left us. I miss you from my class on Sabbath afternoons; you came so regularly during the last few months, that the vacancy strikes me the Inore forcibly. And when I see your seat and miss your face, I always think, 'Oh, if I could only have seen her a Christian before she went!' and then I fear it was some want of faithfulness in me that prevented it. And now, when I learn that your dear mother has, after her patient, toilsome, faithful life, gone home to dwell with the Saviour who was so dear to her here, I feel thatt i i impossible for you longer to refuse to love One Who was so loving 26 O   306     TOM MLLERE; OR, and tender a friend to her, and made her linger- ing, painful death so peaceful and happy. Mary, why is it that you do not yield your sinful heart to be washed and made new in His blood? How can you refuse? Will not your mother and your Sunday-school privileges rise up to condemn you at the last day? Think how dreadful that would be! May the Holy Spirit impress you even now with the truth of what you have been taught, and the necessity of obeying it! I pray for you, by name, every day, and shall continue to do so until I know that you are praying for yourself, as a redeemed and accepted child of God, There has been very little change here in the year and a half since you went away, except that our school is constantly growing larger. Mr. Bennett is now Assistant Superintendent, and besides what he does'in our school, he has established another in Southl street, which he attends in thp morning, and has also a class of poor, hard-work- ing boys who come to him an hour every evening to learn to read and write. He is studying now at home, preparing to enter college and study for the ministry. Is it not wonderful to thinl what that boy has accomplished, by the help of God,   AFTEr R MANY DAYS.      807 in these last eight years? Speaking of John re- minds me of your brother Thomas; they used to be such good friends, and John often speaks of him. Give our regards to him and your father when you see them, and tell us more about Thomas when you write. I was very, very glad to hear of the conversion of your two sisters and your brother. But I cannot forget that there are still so many of you out of Christ, who have had the same instruction and influences. What excuse is there for you in the day of judgment? Mr. Rushton, Gertrude, Robert and Eddie all send kind remembrance to you and your family; so did John Bennett when I told him I should write to you to-day. Very truly your friend and teacher, 'Vt( "EDITH RUISHTON." Thomas held the letter a minute without speak- ing after he had read it to the end. "They make a great fuss over John Bennett,' he said at last; "I don't see what there was in him when I knew him, to turn out this way." "I don't think it was in him when you knew him," replied Mary. "It's his religion, Tom, that's done it all."   308     TOoM MvILLER; OR, Thomas was silent and soon rose to go. "I am going to prayer-meeting with Katy to- night," said Mary, her voice trembling and her face reddening, but yet firmly resolved to speak to her brother of what was in her heart. "I am going to try to be a Christian, Tom; in fact I  hope I am one now, for I think Jesus has for- given my sins and given me a new heart. When that letter came, I couldn't help crying over it, and almost before I knew it I was on my knees begging God to pardon me for the sake of my mother's dear Saviour. And I have been so peaceful and happy all the afternoon. I love Jesus now, but I never did before. Think how He died for us, Tom, and has borne with us so long! Won't you go to the meeting with us?" "I have promised to go somewhere else; I can't, Mary," he said hastily, and 1hurried away. Poor Thomas!  He felt that they were all leaving him, but his heart was no more softened toward the Saviour than before. He felt some emotion-he could hardly have told what was its nature, as he walked rapidly away after the inter- view with his sisters. Go to a prayer-meeting? No, indeed! The thought was repulsive.   AFaTkR MANrY DAYS.      309 He spent the evening in company with rude, rough and profane loungers in a bar-room, listen- ing to stories of fights and feats at pugilistic en- counters, trying all the while to drown the memory of his mother's last words and the accu- sations of his own conscience. Thomas was now twenty years of age. In ap- pearance and strength he was a man, and his father had allowed him on leaving the farm to become his own master. On his second day in St Louis he sought for work, and before night had hired himself to a woodcutter to sell wood for him about the city. In this situation he remained until spring, spending his evenings in resorts something like the one where he had first begun to serve cus- tomers. Not that he cared so much for the com- pany or the drink, but he must go somewhere. He had no taste for reading, to keep him at home .in the evenings, and these places were mnore con- genial than any others, for in them his wayward, rebellious heart was not reminded of the things he was determined to forget. Three or four months of this sort of life was not without marked effect upon his character. He tvas fast becoming reckless, and having no counteracting influences,   810     TOM MIL:LERZ ; On, profanity, gambling and other vices were drawing him into their, toils very rapidly. He seldom went to see his sisters. Since they had become Christians their company was distaste- ful, for they were always talking to him of his sins, and begging him to go to church. In May he received a letter from his father. His health -was restored, he was boarding with the family who lived on their farm, and was able to work again on his own place. But the object of the letter was chiefly to tell Thomas and the girls that a church had been built on the little hill be- yond John's; that meetings had been held every night for some weeks during the Winter; and that Hetty, John, Margaret and himself had been among those who had "passed from death unto life," and were ncwliving witnesses of the mercy and grace of God. Robert had been away dur- ing these meetings, having gone East after his family. But since his .return he too was now anxiously seeking the Saviour, and earnestly mourning over his sins. All this had been most laboriously written by the old man, who had hardly penned two Jletters in his whole life, and this one was scarcely legible.   AF'TER: .MANY DAYS.      3" But the spirit of "joy in the Holy Ghost" peer- vaded it. "We couldn't none of us forgit," he wrote, "your mother's looks and words when she said we must all meet her in heaven.  And now, Tom, we're all trying to fulfil her wishes and her prayers, but you. I write to say that your father don't want you to be left out." Thomas fold ed up the blotted and misspelled letter after making out its contents, and put it in his pocket. Again the same feeling that he ex- perienced when Mary told him she hoped she was a Christian, came over him; a feeling of loneliness and gloom, but yet of utter repugnance^ to religion and Christ. He went round to see Katy that night for the first time in weeks. But he did not show her the letter or tell her its contents. "I'm going away to-morrow," he said, as soon as he was seated, "and I've coine to bid you good-bye." "Why, where are you going, Tom?" asked Katy in surprise. "Oh, I don't know exactly where; down tl e river, to New Orleans, maybe,"   "12   TOM M3ILLjER; OR,  "Why, Thomas, what for?   Can't you get work here?" "Yes, work enough, but I'm tired and it's dull here. I want to see something of the world, and there's nothing to keep me to one place." He rose and held out his hand. "Tell Mary good-bye for me if I. don't see her. Maybe I won't have time." And he hurried off, lest his sister should try to talk seriously with him. And the next day he had hired as fireman on a steamboat going down the Mississippi. He had never felt so restless and reckless before. His clothes had been hurriedly made into a bundle which he had taken on board in his hand. In the afternoon of the first day it was knocked overboard from where he had carelessly laid it, and lost. The officers (would not stop the boat or allow any time to fish for anything so insignificant as a fireman's clothes. He had laid up no money-in St. Louis, so now all he had in the world was his worst suit of clothes, which he hpd put on to work in. So miserable and des- perate did he feel that he scarcely cared for the oss. -The next day he stood leaning carelessly ?   AFT'U1R RMANY DAYS.     313 against the side of the cabin as they were leaving a landing where he had been helping the other firemen to put in some wood. One of the hands passing pushed violently against him, and he was thrown overboard. Being considered rather more valuable than his bundle had been, he was soon picked up. But he had now no change of cloth- ing, and was obliged to sit down shivering and dripping, and dry himself before the fire. The next 'day he lay shaking violently with a chill of "fever and ague,' from xVhich he passed into the stage of burning fever and delirium. There was no comfortable bed or quiet place for him to lie down, and for two or three days he suffered intensely from sickness and privation. He was a stranger to the other firemen and deck hands on the boat, and received very little notice or kind- ness from them. He was not able to go to the table and had no appetite for the food they brought to him.   Without medicine or attention, day after day he crawled or lay about on the 'lower deck, alternately freezing and burning with the paroxysms of his disease. The captain grumbled and swore because he was not able to w6rk, and had no money to pay his passage. And besides 27   314    TORV MTTTT.,TER; OR, all his bodily suffering Thomas felt wretched, unhappy in mind. Wicked as he had been, and willfully and obstinately as he had refused to heed her instructions, he yet mourned his mother. And now, when he knew .that his father and all his brothers and sisters were trying to live in such a way as to meet her in heaven, and he only was a wanderer from God, he felt a sort of blind rage and selfish despair, though he was yet determined l not to yield. But who can follow the unreason- ing, willful waywardness of the unregenerate heart, or estimate the power of Satan over it? We can only know that God has given us the power to choose salvation through His Son, and refusing or neglecting to make that choice, we know not where we may be led. Certain it is that a more miserable wretch could scarcely be found than Thomas Miller was, on the day of their arrival in New Orleans, Dirty, sick and emaciated in body, discouraged, soured and reck- less in mind, he walked,'or rather staggered, off the steamboat and up the street, not knowing, and scarcely caring, what he did. He found an acquaintance from St. Louis liv- ing near the levee, who took him home with him.   AF:T}ER MANY ZDAYS.      315 His home, however, wasl a poor and filthy hovel.  Here Thomas lay'sick for some weeks. Getting a little better, he crawled out and tried to find work. He hired out to a drayman, but his ague returning, he was forced to go back to his friend's  shanty again and lie down on his old bed in one corner of the room, where the wife and five chil- dren lived constantly, and three men came in for  their meals. They were as kind to him as was in their power, perhaps; but the noise, confusion and dirt made him almost wild. How many times the thought of his mother's neat house- keeping and appetizing food tantalized his fevered  senses!  "I shall never get well while I stay in New  Orleans," he said to Dennis O'Byrne one night.  He had lain all d4y burning with fever and tortured with thirst, and longing inexpressibly for coolness, quiet, and a mother's or sister's presence.  "That same is thrue for yees," said Dennis; "I  said it to the old woman this mornin' mesilf. An' I said to her, says I, 'Molly, I've got twinty    ' dollars saved up from me wages that I was goin' to buy mesilf a dray, but I'll sind the poor lad  t H   316     TOM MLILER,; OR, to his folks with it, and he can pay when he likes!'" ( "You are very kind, and I thank you for it, Dennis. I hope I shall soon get well, and be able to pay you. I hate to take your money, even to pay my fare home, but maybe it is best for you as well as me." "It's welcome ye are to the loan of it. It's for yer mother's sake we'll do it, for neither me nor Molly can iver forget her doin' for us when we had the faver in St. Louis. Sure me boy Teddy, as was only six year old, talks about her yit, and the stories she told him about Jesus when he was sick!" So one of the many unobtrusive acts of Chris- tian love in Mrs. Miller's life came back to bless her son in this his time of need. In his weakness and partial delirium Thomas had thought much about his oldest sister, Ann, and fancied that if he could get to her, she would be most like his mother. The feeling still had such strong possession of his heart that he de- termined to go to Philadelphia instead of back to St. Louis, hoping as he got better to get work as fireman, to pay the additional expense. He   AF'TER MANY DAYS.       317 became much better as he went up the river, the fever and ague seemed left behind, and he started up the Ohio on another boat, sufficiently well to work for his passage. 27    XVIII. "Wanderer from God, return, return; Renounce thy sins, thy Saviour lives; Go to His bleeding cross, and learn How freely, fully He forgives " THOMAS'S health did not long continue to improve. They had a tedious and toilsome trip up the Ohio, and before the boat arrived at Cincinnati he was very sick again. He had a few dollars left of his friend's loan, and on reach- ing that city he resolved to go on shore and find some place of shelter more comfortable and quiet than the noisy deck. He was unable to walk alone; but, by the aid of one of the hands, he reached a boarding-house near the'landing, where they consented to take him in. The boatman helped him to the room given and then returned to the boat, leaving him alone on the bed. His disease had now become typhoid fever, and this 318   A"Ux J:K MA ANYX DAYS.   319 removal had exhausted almost the last effort of his reason. -He sunk into insensibility, from which he at times awoke to partial consciousness, in which he keenly realized his sufferings and wants. For five days he lay in that small fourth- story room of the noisy Dutch boarding-house. Once a day a woman came in, brought drink or food, looked at him, and went out. He could not understand her, nor did she seem to hear what he said to her. He had given them all of his money the first day. It was only enough to pay a week's board, the landlord said, so he had not sent for a doctor. What he would do with the sick man when the week was up he had not de- cided. If he should die, the city would have to give him a pauper's burial, because that would be an expense the landlord could not bear. It was the evening of the fifth day since he had come there, when a young gentleman entered the bar-room of the house, and after looking around for sonie one whom he did not find, sat down as if to wait till he came in, moving his chair near the door, and taking out a newspaper from his overcoat pocket. Before he began to read his attention was arrested by a conversa-   320     TOM MLLjER; OR; ,  / tion going on between the landlord and a man at the bar. "How is the sick man?" the latter had asked. "Very bad-very bad, indeed. He will die soon, I think," the landlord replied. "Don't you know his name? Has he no folks in the city?" "No, he is all alone. He got off from a boat going to Pittsburgh. I have kept him ever since." "Had he no money?" "Yes, a little, but it is all gone now. I wish he would die, if he is going to. I can't afford to keep him and take care of him without some more money." "Who is the sick man you speak of? Is he in your house?" asked the young gentleman, rising from his chair and walking up to the land- lord. "Yes, sir, he is here. He is a stranger, and he has a very bad fever, and will die." "Young or old?" "Young, sir-not more than twenty-one or two at the best." "He may live, then, with good care. The   AFTETR .MANY AN IDAYS.   821 young do not die so easily. Can I see this young man? Perhaps I can do something for him." "Yes, sir, certainly. Katrine, bring me a candle. I'll take you right up, sir." And, candle in hand, the fat, burly Dutch landlord led the way to the top of his house, where in a low back room lay the sufferer. The young gentleman shuddered as he thought what it must be to lie there alone and dying, in the darkness. "This is the room, sir, but I don't think he knows anything now. He just lies and calls for his mother till lie is clear beat out, and then sleeps, the woman says." "Thank you!" the strange young gentleman said, taking the candle, and the landlord went clattering heavily back down the narrow stair- way. The young man paused a moment at the door to listen to the incoherent mutterings of the suf- ferer, then walked in and up to his bed. "Dying, I am afraid," he said to himself; "still Dr. Brown shall settle that question. He shall at least have clean clothing and what comforts I can procure while he does live." And setting   322    TaOM M  jILLER; OrR, down the candle, he hurried again down stairs and at, once left the boarding-house, telling the landlord to send the woman up to stay until he eturned.       ' Dr. Brown, came, and on going away sent a urse-a strong, good-natured Irishwoman-to take care of his new patient. He was a young but faithful and charitable physician, who spent the time while waiting for practice in gratuitously as- sisting the poor.  "We must call on the Belmonts for what we need for this case," he said to the young man who had called him, and with whom he seemed very intimately acquainted; "they've offered to help us, and here's a chance. You and I are not rich, old fellow, but we can stir up those who have got money, to a sense of their duty. This poor young fellow shall live, if nursing and treat- ment can save him." Two days after, as they both sat beside Thomas, watching till he should awake from a sleep which the doctor said was a crisis in his disease, he opened his eyes with a look of intelligence. His gaze rested eagerly on one face after an other of the two strange gentlemen and the nurse, and   AE'TE1  MANY D3AYS.     823 then he turned his head away, and murmured wearily and sadly, "No mother!" "Where is your mother?" asked the young doctor, taking his hand. "Perhaps she can come to see you.' \ ' .  "She is dead. All of them are in heaven but me!" he whispered. "All your friends dead?" asked the other young man. "No, not dead, but they have left me alone. They are all going to heaven without me." This idea had never wholly left him since his first sickness, and now was the first to come to his. half-conscious thought. "He is a little delirious yet, I think," said Dr. Brown. "What is your name, my poor fellow?" asked the other, bending over him tenderly. "Thomas Miller, sir," listlessly and wearily. As consciousness returned, the old pain and bitter- ness surged back into his heart. "Thomas Miller! Did you ever live in Phila- delphia?" "Yes, sir, when I was a boy. Your father was a weaver and went West?"   324     TOM MTTTTiKR,; OR, "Yes, sir. Did you know him? I don't know you, sir." Don't you remember John Bennett, Tommy?" "Yes. Are you John Bennett? Where am I? In Philadelphia?" And something of interest lighted up the wan, thin features. John Bennett, for it was he, told Thomas how he had found him there sick, and memory soon supplied the missing links in the story. "And how came you here?"  He asked this question the next day of his old friend. "I am here as a student, Thomas. I have been spending this summer reading with the Rev. Dr. Wise, and sometimes in my leisure hours I hunt up some poor fellows to whom I can be of ser- vice." "And so you found me?" "Yes." John did not tell how many such as he he had helped to relieve, or how many children he had gathered into Sunday-schools, while visit- ing just such localities. "You are getting ready to be a minister, are you, John?"  "Yes, I hope to preach the gospel in two or three years more."   AFTER V. IANY DAxS.     325 "It's a great change since we were boys, John." Yes, a great change." John said no more, for his knowledge of human nature told him that Thomas's own thoughts were his best preach- ers in those days. He did not need instruction, nor conviction, but only softening and persuading. And some people are very hard to persuade front the outside, and must be left to their own con- sciences at times. A week or two later and Thomas began to get about a little, and one day the doctor took him in his carriage to Mr. Bennett's room to spend the day with him. Perhaps we had better call him Mr. Bennett, rather than John now, for he was highly respected and honored by many of the best and wisest people in both Philadelphia and Cincinnati for his unselfish, useful Christian life, his fine talents and education, and his high spi- ritual attainments. "I must study some this morning, Thomas," he said; "after dinner I will be at liberty to en- tertain you. Here are books which you can look over. There is a port-folio of drawings, some of them made by a young lady that you may re- member-Gertrude Rushton." 28 L   326     TOM: MTT:TI TER; OR, A faint flush came over the young student's brow as he pronounced the name, though he tried to speak carelessly. Thomas saw it and solilo- quized-"What does that mean, I wonder?" Mr. Bennett watched a little to see what his visitor would take up from his table or book- shelves. He was studying Thomas attentively, and had been ever since he discovered his identity, to see how and where he might begin the work of leading him to be reconciled to God. It may seem strange, but he had so far avoided speaking to him of religion. He knew he was not perish- ing for lack of knowledge, but from the persistent holding out of stubborn self-will. And he knew, too, that injudicious interference might prolong the struggle. He was waiting for indications where to strike the blow which should help to free him. But in his prayers he wrestled with God for wisdom and grace for hours together, and implored the Spirit's power to soften and sub- due the obstinate, rebellious one. Seemingly busy with his own book, how re- joiced he was to see Thomas, with a furtive glance toward him, choose the Bible from the table and retire to the sofa at the other end of the room.   AFTETR  MVI MANY DA-YS.   827 A pillow and blanket had been placed there for him when he first arrived. Knowing that he needed nothing, Mr. Bennett forebore to speak to him for an hour or two, and was apparently ab- sorbed in his studies. Thomas turned slowly and uncertainly from place to place, making out with difficulty to read the verses to which he opened. After a while he took out some paper and a pencil from his pocket, and spreading it on the arm of the sofa, began to write very laboriously, copying from the Bible which lay open before him. As he still seemed anxious to avoid notice, John seemed not to see what he was doing. It was nearly dinner-time when he closed the volume he had been reading, and turned to Thomas. He too had just finished his task and returned his pencil and paper to his pocket. "You have been well occupied, I see," said John, glancing at the Bible which still lay open on the sofa. "Yes, mother would say so," answered Thomas. "She loved that book." John had so uniformly avoided conversing with him on religious topics, that he now really began   328     TOM MTrTRR; onR, to wish that he would say something to him. And this was just what John wanted, for if Thomas could be led to begin thegeonversation, he would not feel that he was attacled or be ral- lying to defend himself. John knew that the Spirit had been striving with him ever since his sickness, and that the memory of his mother's teaching was busy at his heart. So he only waited and prayed. "She did indeed!" he replied to Thomas's remark. "And she was very familiar with it, too." "Yes, she could remember it without writing down," said Thomas; "but there was some things she used to repeat that I could n't quite forget or quite remember, and I thought I would take your Bible and find them and write them down." "Have you no Bible?" "I have one in St. Louis." "Here is one you can use while you stay here," said John, still carelessly, as if he did not intend to press it. "Thank you. I wanted to see those things mother used to talk about." There was so much emotion in his manner that   AXT:TER :MANTY DAYS.     329 John ventured to say, "What were the things you were copying?" There was a visible struggle, but Thomas si- lently handed the paper to his friend. He had felt that morning as if he mnust have help, though had it been urged upon him, Satan might still have tempted him to turn away. John could scarcely make it out, the writing being half manuscript, half printed, and small letters and capitals strangely mingled. But after looking at it a moment he read aloud: "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin." "Mother used to say that over, always when -- she was talking about Jesus," said Thomas. John read on: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world." "There was a good many more," said Thomas, as he folded up the paper, "but I couldn't find 28 * v   830     TOM MTTT F.R; OR, them. Now I've got the book I mean to look all of the things out that mother used to say about Him." "About Jesus?" "Yes. I used to hate to hear her speak His name. I don't know how it was. I believed the Bible was true, and that God was angry with sinners and would punish them, and that Christ died for for them, and all that; but I couldn't bear to give up and be saved by Him. I don't know why." "Do you feel so now, Thomas?" "Sometimes I do, but more times it keeps com- ing into my mind what she said: 'There is but one way in which you can be saved, and that is by faith in Jesus;' and she used to read this: 'We love him  because he first loved us.' I couldn't find them two places." "I will find them and mark them for you. So you think you love Jesus more than you did? Or rather, that you don't hate Him so much as you did?" "I don't know. I think about Him all the time. But I don't believe that He will forgive 'me, I have been such a great sinner."   AFTER, MANY DAYS.      831 "'He is able to save unto the uttermost.' He saves the chief of sinners. 'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.'" "Yes, I wanted to find those places too," said Thomas eagerly, "and something about sins like scarlet being forgiven by Him." "You heard all of these years ago, Thomas?" 4  "Yes, but I wouldn't mind 'em. Do you think it is any use to think about it now, John?" And the proud, rebellious, stubborn heart melted into tears as he spoke. "Are you certain that you can't save yourself without the Saviour, Thomas?" "Oh, you know I can't! The Bible says so everywhere." "And you want to be saved?" "Yes. I must be saved. If I had died, I should have gone to hell. I must repent-I must be a Christian before I die." "Do you believe that Jesus is able to save you?" "Yes, I do. He is God's own Son, and God has promised to forgive those that Jesus pleads for." "Do, you think He is willing to save you?"   332     TOM: MTTjT;,  ; OR, "He says he will save all that come." "Is there anything then for Him to do to save you?" "No. He said 'It is finished' when He died. I remember mother said, 'He is waiting to be gracious.'" It was wonderful how all the words of that mother, spoken amid the coldness, indifference and scorn of all around her, came back to her re- pentant son now from the depths of his memory, fastened there by their divine power. "Then it is all for you to do, isn't it?" said John, still questioning, not dictating. "If you go to Him and ask Him to save you, He will do it." "Yes, I suppose so, but---" "He is able, He is willing, He is ready and waiting. How much longer shall he wait?" The look, the impressive tone of his friend, aided the Spirit to remove the last barrier. A moment's silent struggle, and he sank upon his knees beside the sofa.. John knelt by his side, and with earnest, child-like faith pleaded with God to aid the decision. Thomas broke out into audible prayer as he concluded, calling for mercy   AFTDER. MANY DAYS.      338 and pardon through the blood of Jesus, whom he had so long despised and rejected. Tears and sobs choked his utterance as he faltered out these words, "A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise!" but there was faith and triumph in his voice when, rising to his feet, he exclaimed, "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!" Mother, take courage! That precious Bible, never voluntarily opened or heard by him, but constantly upon his mother's lips through all his wayward boyhood, had saved him at last!   XIX. A MOITBFET S FMZT IT HONORED. "I think that God our heavenly Father, in His infinite love for us, and His bqundless sympathizing tenderness, re- ceives and blesses the work of our hands according to the love that prompted, and not according to the skill that wrought." "T MUST go back to St. Louis and to Illinois, I to see my sisters and my father," said Thomas Miller to his old friend, as soon as he had become able to undertake the journey. "They are all grieving over me and praying for me, and I must tell them as quick as I can what God has done for my soul." "Yes," said Mr. Bennett, "I thought that would be your first wish. I told Dr. Brown so." "I don't know how I shall ever be able to pay you and Dr. Brown for all you have done for me," said Thomas, his voice trembling with emo- tionl; "but it shall be as soon as I can, so far as money goes.  The rest can never be paid." 334   AFiTER MANY DAYS.      335 "I owe your mother a great debt," said John Bennett, his voice, too, growing a little husky- "a debt which I have been glad partially to re- pay to her son." "Owe my mother a debt?" "Yes. She first invited and persuaded me to go to Sunday-school, and under God, I owe all I am-and all I hope ever to be, will be due also-to that Sunday-school. I have one piece of advice for you, Thomas, when you have chosen your fti- ture home. Find a Sunday-school, or if you can't find one, make one, and go to work in it." "Oh, John, what can I do in a Sunday-school?" "You can find something which will help in it, if it be only to stand outside in the street and per- suade idle children to go in. Go yourself every Sunday, and whatever you find to do, do it with your might." The next morning, the doctor having given his permission, Mr. Bennett accompanied his friend to the depot, and placed in his hand a ticket for St. Louis and a five-dollar note, as he bade him good-bye. There was great joy in the hearts of all his brothers and sisters, and fervent thankfulness in   336     TOM: MTTTT PTR; OR, that of his father when Thomas reappeared among them, and they learned that this last and dearest of all the mother's flock was gathered into the fold of the Good Shepherd. He was received into the church to which his sisters Mary and Katy belonged, and began a Christian's life in the city where so lately he had mingled with the low and wicked frequenters of drinking dens and gambling houses. With some assistance from his father he began life as a drayman, and was within a year or two married to a Christian girl who had been a warm friend of his younger sister Katy. But for sev- eral years he struggled with poverty, sickness, and severe losses, and was scarcely able to provide comforts for their home. After many reverses, however, Providence began to bestow not only comforts, 'but competence and wealth. He did not forget the counsel of his friend, even in his destitution. A small Mission School had been formed near them. For many months he stole in every Sabbath, shabby and shamefaced, and sitting in the most retired seat, behind the door, listened eagerly to the lessons. One day the superintendent came and begged   I , A1iFT:EuR NMAty DA YS.    387 him to take charge of a class whose teacher was absent. What! 7ie become a teadr! He shrunk back abashed and dismayed. But the superintendent insisted, and he went and sat down with the boys, who all seemed to be just such boys as he had been and known. This touched his heart and opened his lips, and he began to tell them the story of his own boy- hood, of his mother, of Jesus's long suffering with him, of the blessedness of his present hope. His language was earnest and simple, and such as they could understand. The story of the Cross had seemed wonderful and beautiful to them from the lips of the gentlemen and ladies who taught them, but from those of this rough, ragged, honest drayman it came with new and strange power. Some of them were sobbing before he concluded. Passing over a period of twelve years, Ive will again look in upon that Mission Sunday-school in 1858. It has largely increased in numbers. Three  hundred children from homes of poverty, degrada- 29   338     TOM 1 TTTAR; OR, tion and crime assemble in it every week. A faithful and efficient corps of teachers are striving to bring them to a knowledge of Him who taketh away the sins of the world. The school has been removed from its first location to a commodious hall over a market-house, and is rapidly yet steadily extending its influence. In its active and energetic superintendent are you surprised to recognize Thomas Miller? Yes, Tommy, the little bobbin-winder--Tom, the grog-shop bar-tender, the young Illinois farmer- boy, and the poor, hardworking drayman-is be- fore us. He has been all these, yet now stands here an earnest, practical, useful laborer in the Sunday- school field. His wife and children are here also, either as teacher or scholars. In their appearance we read evidences of worldly prosperity as well as Chris- tian grace. God will withhold no good thing from them that love Him, unless deprivation be our needed discipline. For some years Thomas Miller has been blessed "in basket and in store." "The hand of the diligent maketh rich," and the diligent industry and economy of his father have been imitated by him wherever it did not conflict  ^   AFT'TER 3IrANY DAYS.      339 with Christian benevolence and duty to God's cause. From a successful teacher he became the assis- tant superintendent of this school, which post he filled for six years. When the former super- intendent was removed by death he was selected for that position. Nor does this school embrace all the work his hands have found to dp for Christ. In other charitable and beneficent enter- prises he'has been prompt to do, active to search for opportunity, liberal to the extent of what God has entrusted to his stewardship. His whole life gives evidence of the heart truly regenerated by the Holy Spirit, the man "baptized into newness of life," and made perfect unto every good word and work. On the Sabbath on which we have chosen to *look in upon the school, Mr. Miller, as we will call our old friend, seems peculiarly anxious for the best of order and the most credible appearance possible to be attained. Perhaps a note received by him through the post-office the evening be- fore may explain this anxiety. He takes it out and glances over it once more, as he stands by his   340     TOM  MILELJFRn; OR, desk waiting until the teachers have begun the lesson with their classes before going his usual round: ST. LOUIS, October 15, 1858. MY DEAR OLD FRIEND:-I am, with my wife, staying at the Washington Hotel for a few days, and would like to see you once\more. Can you come and see us, or let us know where to ind you? By the grace of Christ our Saviour, Ever faithfully yours, JOHN BENNETT. They have never met since they parted in Cin- cinnati thirteen years since. During the next two years, by the closest economy, Thomas dis- charged the debt to his friend and the young doctor, and received their acknowledgment of the receipt of the money.  He had not written again, for he had little ability or facility with his pen. Alas, his lost opportunities in boyhood re- proached him every day. He felt bitterly and constantly that, whatever he might do or become, it would never be without their improvement what it might have been with it. Perhaps there was a little, a very little, of "vain-glory" in the thought which prompted him, late on Saturday night, to answer this note   AIFTER MANY DAYS.        341 and leave his own at the hotel personally, without waiting to see his old friend. He wished to be sure of its being received by Mr. Bennett on Sunday morning. ST. Louis, Saturday, Oct. 16, 1858. REV. JOHN BENNETT:-Dear Sir: I received your note, and will be at the -  Market Sunday-school to-morrow afternoon at half-past one o'clock. If you and your wife will come there to see me you. will very much oblige, Truly yours, THOMAS MLLER. As he stood waiting his heart thrilled with gratified feeling, which we will hope was not  quite unpardonable, as he remembered the last advice of John in parting with him: "Go to work in a Sunday-school." There was a little stir near the door, and one of the teachers came forward conducting a gentle- man and lady, who were followed by two beauti- ful children. "Mr. Miller, the Rev. Mr. Bennett and his wife. He tells me he was to see you here." One swift glance around that spacious hall filled with orderly and studious children and faithful teachers, another at the man who stood 293 '    342     TOM M:ILE:ER; OR, before him, evidently the ruling spirit of the work, and John Bennett read it all. Grasping the hand of his old playmate he exclaimed, "Thank God, Thomas, that I meet you here!"' Mrs. Bennett was, as Thomas had anticipated, she who had borne the name of Gertie Rushton. Her girlish bloom and roundness had scarcely begun to leave her face, which was still framed within soft masses of brown curls. She had grown very much like her mother, Mr. Miller thought, and wore the same spiritual brightness on her serene and lovely face. She had been married for ten years, and the little boy and girl were her children-Ernest,and Eva. She greeted Thomas Miller very warmly, re- membering her mother's warm interest in the family and loving sympathy for his mother. Mrs. Miller, the teacher of a large class of girls, came forward and was introduced to these old friends of her husband. By Gertie especially was she cordially received,'as she read in her fair, earnest face evidences of the same humble piety and unfaltering faith that had so distinguished the life of her husband's mother. Mr. Bennett's heart was at first too full for ex-   AFTER MANY DAYS.       343 pression. He had believed Thomas's conversion to be sincere and thorough, and had therefore ex- pected to find him living a consistent Christian life. But he had not thought of meeting him in a position like this. He had not known the strength of that nature which he had seen yield itself to Jesus. "You are at work in a wide and promising field," he said, as soon as he could trust himself to speak of what he saw around him. "Yes, a noble and extended field indeed," said Mr. Miller. "We are near the centre of the most densely populated part of the city. Those residing about us are chiefly German and Irish Roman Catholics and infidels. The nearest church or Sabbath-school of any evangelical de- nomination is three-fourths of a mile distant." Mr. Miller could always talk freely when the sub- ject of his school was broached, for its interests filled his heart. "You must find in such a locality many strong opposing influences." "Yes, we-do indeed. Not only Christianity, but morality and decency, are opposed by nearly all around us."   B44     TOM MTTSTARR; OR, "' I need not ask as to your success," said Mrs. Bennett, who was an attentive listener; "this school is evidence of it. It must be now a well- established centre of good influences for this com- munity. But I see you hate still room for more pupils, and no doubt there are hundreds close around you to be gathered in.' "A  school of a thousand scholars could be raised right here, I believe," replied: Mr. Miller; "and we shall try to swell our number to that in a year or two. Will you look through our school now?" Mrs. Bennett preferred to stay beside Mrs. Miller, and was soon engaged with the class, while its teacher sat listening to her charming in- structions and illustrations. Gertie had been brought up in the Sunday-school, and was famil- lar with all its needs. She had for years studied the work under the tutorage of her parents, and a more efficient teacher could scarcely be found. Mrs. Miller gained new ideas and learned fresh modes of interesting her pupils during the half s hour her visitor talked to them of Jesus. Mean- while the two reunited friends were passing through the school,   AFTER MANY DAYS.       8345 Perhaps, if ever mortals might be proud of any position or achievement, these two might justly have been proud of theirs on that day-one of them, as Christ's ambassador to men, preaching the tidings of salvation; the other, in the noble station of a Sunday-school superintendent, seek- ing out neglected, destitute and vicious little ones, and directing their wayward feet into the path of safety. But I do not think it was pride, but rather in- tense thankfulness and grateful joy, which swelled their hearts as side by side they passed around the room, talking together of the things that per- tain to the kingdom of God. After the lesson was finished in her class, Mrs. Miller sent to the teachers of her own children a request that they might come to her and be pre- sented to their father's old friend. They were three in number, John, Jane and Willie, all healthy and interesting children. "When papa was a little boy this lady got him to go to Sunday-school," she told them. Willie stared. 'Don't she never get old, mamma?" "Oh, I was a little girl then, Willie-a very   little girl. Your papa was the largest. Do you love the Sunday-school?" and Mrs. Bennett laid her hand caressingly on the little boy's head, which was very like what his father's had been when she saw it first in the early home in Phila- delphia. "Yes, ma'am. It is our Sabbath home. 'We live in the house other days, but Sundays this is our home, papa says." Mrs. Bennett smiled. "I hope you will always love it, Willie, and you too, John and Jane, and that you will all grow up to be very useful in it." Mr. Bennett and Mr. Miller were coming up toward the desk again, still conversing in low, earnest tones. "You do not ask about my work," the former was saying, "but I must tell you what I am try- ing to do, nevertheless." "I heard, some years ago, that you were in charge of a church at Nelson, Ohio." "Yes, that was immediately after our marriage, and I stayed there four years. The next four I was in Cincinnati as pastor of the church to which I belonged while there as a student. I   have resigned there also, however, and am now to spend one, two, or more years in travelling for the Sunday-school cause, aiming to establish mis- sion schools like this of yours, and arouse a spirit which will sustain them, in every town in the great and growing West, where they are not already organized. Religious people everywhere need to be awakened to the importance of this department of Christ's work." "Excuse me, John, but how can you afford this?"Thomas Miller always came directly to the point. "My father-in-law, Mr. Rushton, who you know was early wealthy, and whom  God has blessed more abundantly as years have passed, together with another equally pious and generous gentleman of Philadelphia, has proposed to sup- port me and defray the expenses of such a work so long as I will devote myself to it. You know how entirely his heart has been in the work, for years, and his faith grows stronger in this instru- mentality for bringing souls to Christ." "It is a noble enterprise," said Mr.' Miller, his heart dilating at the thought. "God will surely bless it to His honor and glory in the   salvation of thousands. Who would ever have thought, John, when you and I were boys together, running away from Sunday-school, breaking the Sabbath, profaning God's holy name, and dis- obeying our parents and teachers, that through God's mercy we should stand here to-day? But your sin was not like mine. You yielded early to the Spirit." "To your sainted mother, Thomas, I am in- debted for the earthly means of my conversion. I never forgot that night she prayed for us be- side your little bed." "And you had but one night of her prayers to remember, a few hours of her influence, while I resisted both for so many years! Oh, John, I be- lieve God has forgiven me, but I shall never cease to wonder at it or to mourn over my lost boyhood. If I had only yielded that night! If my mother could only have lived to know I was a Christian!" "She left you in the hands of God. Doubtless her glorifiedg spirit has rejoiced over you in heaven, and is watching your chosen work. Your father too, is gone home?" "Yes, he died two years ago. I wish you could   have known him as a Christian, John. He was so changed, so happy on his death-bed." "And all your brothers and sisters are living in the fear of God and a hope of salvation? How much you, as a family, have to be thankful for! You are still a young man, Thomas, and with such a work as this before you, the future may be full of blessings for you, and Heaven reward you with a crown in which shall shine many stars of rejoicing." "But, John, my neglected education? What can I do without the knowledge I so recklessly refused to gain? I mourn every day over those wasted privileges. If, by the Saviour's mercy, I am permitted to see heaven, it will be too great forgiveness for such a rebel as I have been." And tears stood in the strong man's eyes, as they often did when he thought of his mother and her trials. "But come, John, you must tell my boys and girls the story. They have heard it, often-per- haps too often--fr6om me, but it will have new interest when they know that you were the com- panion of my erring boyhood, who saved my life when I was dying." 30   350     TOM MTTTITER,; OR, And there, with a hundred boys just such as they had been before him, each one of whom might be thrilled with emulation and touched with conviction, and as many girls who might learn to be in a hundred homes what Mrs. Miller had been in hers, and be encouraged never to be weary in well-doing, John Bennett told the story. It has been blessed to the hearts and lives of many who have heard it in that school-room. That patient Christian woman's life of self-denial, faith and hope has touched many a selfish heart with a sense of its need of Jesus, while its glad fuiition has encouraged many a mother to "labor and to wait" amid darkness and discouragement. When He maketh up His jewels, that lowly and meek toiler will shine in radiance as one of those who turn many to righteousness, though she was not permitted to see of the travail of her soul and be satisfied. Christian men and women, laborers in daily homes and Sunday homes over all this 'broad land, is our faith of the kind that can unfalter- ingly labor for twenty years without visible token   AFTER;  MANY DAYS.      351 of success? To our weak senses the reward is sometimes long in coming, but let us ever feel that the testimonies of the Lord are sure, VERY SURE. THE END.
