CHAPTER I.
ON the outskirts of the forest of.Hallate
resided Pier-re Aubin, the gamekeeper of
the neighboring wood of. Bsassseuse. His
sinall but comfortable dwelling was not far
from the banks of the sweet little stream the
Aulnette, and at no great distance-from the
city of Paris.
Through the vista of ,the forest might be
seen, approaching the house, -a laughing
merry group of peasants who were retui-ning'
from the Parish church of Flewrines, where
they had been in procession, to present at
tgie Baptismal Font, ;the first-born :babe of
the gamne-keeper, and hil spouse, the pretty
Ogcile Robert. ,
Had the infant been .the long-desired' heir
to riches and grandeur, its entrance on the
theatre .of existence, could not have been
greeted with a warmer welcome than -was
bestowed on the girl Philiberte. Yet was the,
little one not of the sex that had been ar-
depitly desired by the husband or the father
of the young wife and m~othet .
This rural festival was attended by young
and old from all parts of the neighborhood,
and the whole day was -a succession of
dances, laughter, discharges of musketry, re-

lieved by- refreshments, and plentuous liba-

tions of the light wines of the country.
:The weather .was gloriously propitious (pr
this merriment, which was carried on without
doors, on the .green sward, under the shade
of the magnificent, trees-whilst within 're-
clinaed the delighted mother of three days
on a couch of snowy whiteness., She wpis
coquettishy dressed, for the occasion, in her
most ihecomning cap, ruffled to the throat -ini
fine linen and lace gind adorned with a pe
fusion .of jribands, and on her hands wee
white gloves, as though she were a: bride.
At her feet reposed her little girl softly eli-
soonced in eider-do.gn.
Hlbw beautiful and interesting Cecile look..
ed in her 'yew happiness, as she smiled on
the pledge of conjugal affection.
-Pierre Aubin seated by their side regarded
hlis wife and child, alternately, with proud
satisfaction-and well he might do so-for
he had braved the 'threat of death and de-
2strtiction to obtain the charming Cecile, for.
his~bride !":- Frequiently during the enteia~r
nient' did he leave his guests awhile, thus to
contemplate these dear objects of his love'.-
So heapipily had time ypassed awayt~
evening arrived before any'oriethoughtit so
late, 'Then in thsalargest apartment ofit
'house was apgead out a feast 18r whicl thk

present manor called 'La Grange' had fidence he rejoined his company saying to
been laid under contribution; but as the j himself,-

fashion of the country required that it should
be within sight of the convalescent, in whose
honor it was given, the door of Cecile's
room was left open and the company at table
were seated within view, in order to afford a
prospect of their enjoyment.
With rustic, national, politeness, the hap-
py guests posted themselves around the well-
covered board, one expecting a night of' in-
nocent hilarity and good cheer, to 'terminate'
a day of pleasure.
A thick fog exhaling from the low rich
marshy ground added to the darkness of the,
night and east ~t murky veil over the game-
keeper's hoiis~ Whilst, however, without
all' was silent and dark, within was light,
~h'eerfulnes5"and merry noise. The i~inging
'of 'glasses, 'the crack 'of the, fire, and
above all the 'thousand little pleasantries of
word and deed-so foolish to repeat, to retid,
or if out 'of place and unsuited to the occa~
sion.-.-.but which not only seem, but are in
reality so' delightful and eOtertaining when
*hen they are opportunely brought forward.
PierreAubin alone seemed restless, and he
frequently left his place at the table, under
various little pretexts, to satisfy himself~ that
his Cecile and babe were safe and well.
:'- Think not that it was merely; as he assert-
ed, to retail to her the witticisms of the
guests that he so often repaired tct the chain-
j~er. No! whilst the smile was on his lips
and affection in his eye, his heart was a prey
t9 a sad presentment.
~ ~oftly, he murmured to himself' as he bent
oyer his sleeping b~be'and. smiling wife
'May God. grant me vigilance and strength
to guard against the hatred y.'hick is on tile
~watch, and i~he vengeance s~eking. to 1k sated.'
In imagin~ition, Pierre mn4e his lpve a:
s~ield of protection for these helples~objects
of, his lender solicitude, and regaining cort-

'I defy both hatred and revenge: they
cannot deprive 'me of wife and child!
The father of Cecile, 'a worthy old veteran,
had drank the health of his idol Napoleon,
and of his former Colonel,.so often that he
had becom~ inebriated, but very joyous, and
he proposed singing the popular revolution-
ary air-the Marseillaise Hymn. When at
the second verse, distinctly was heard in the
distancec, the dismal shriek of a screech-
owl, twice repeated.
'Who is the ill-omened musician who
dares to accompany me in this strain? 'in-
quired the singer, Decadi Robert, stopping
abruptly and looking angrily around' for
Nicholas Godard, a notorious jester who had
eontributed much to the entertainment of the
company by his practical jokes. Had~ he
been absent, Decadi would have' been at no
loss to whom to 'attribute the unpleasant in-
terruptuon, and would have known how to
pay him off for it, but the facetious plough-
boy had not staTted from his place.
~ I will go on with my song,' said the old
soldier.
'Do so, by all means;' exclaimed' every
one except Pierre Aubin who, though none
remarked, had started and turned deathly
pale at the cry which had stopped the sin~ih~
of his father-in-law. Looking 'towhrds' the
chamber where his young wife was reposing,
Pierre repeated quite lOw, the Words already
used-
'Hatred and i'evenge I defy you! You
cannot deprive rite of w~fr and child.'
'The 'chorus to 'the' second verse was just
ended, and, like the 'crow in 'the fable, the
grandfather r of baby'Philiberte waS opening
his large mouth for the 'third stanza, when
'again came the dismal cry of the owl, sound-
ing nearer than before.
' 'Ah, indeed ['The crean~re is 'determined

REGINA.

not to let me sing by myself,' remarked Dc.
cadi Robert. Then for the first time observ-
ing thi~t his son-in-law was greatly disturbed,
he said: 'Why, Pierre, you are trembling,
you shake like an aspen leaf.'
'I tremble indeed, say you? Not in the
least,' so saying, Pierre seizing hold. of a
glass of wine to show how steady his hand
Was, raised it to his lips-but set it down un-
tasted~ for he felt it was impossible.
'What wonder that he is put out a bit,'
said the Godmother. 'Is there not cause
for it? This is a bad omen on a christening
day. The almanac says,-When the owl
sings at the feast, beware, for death *is on
the watch!'
'Yes it isquite true that we may fear the
owl, Every one knows that. hut then
there is no danger when some one imitates
its cry. I would lay a wager that what we
have just heard comes from some one, some
wag who is amusing himself as a screech-
owl-that's all, depend upon it,~ sai4 Nich9-
las Godard.
'Are you sure of that?' inquired Cecile,
*whom the floise had alarmdd also, and who
raising herself up had drawn the sleeping
Philiberte to her side.
Certainly I am very sure of it,' replied
the clown, 'and to prove it I will reply to
the call, and I flatter myself I can do the
thing a little more naturally than that laugh-
ing fellow, whoever he is.'
Before Pierre Aubin had time to forbid
him Nicholas, uttered such a tremendous cry
and made so comical a face, that the laughter
interrupted for a time was renewed by the
whole assembly who burst fok~th in. shouts of
mirth.
Notwithstanding the uproarious hilarity,
Cecile's husband, who was listening atten-
tively, caught the sound of a third cry-but
this time evidently at a greater distance from
the house. He aros~, saying, in an offhand

sort of nianner, int~nded'.to prevent his wife
being uneasy.
'flow can you all be talking so about dwIs
and screech owls? The fumes of wine hive
reached our heads and made us hear strange
things. I know what makes the noise. The
stable door at the other end of the court
yard has been left open~. and the least wind
makes it creak on its 'old rusty hinges,' said
Pierre. AulAn.
'The stable door,' repeated Nicholas,
'That's' a good one I It is another tune It
will sing when it wants to say-' shut me if
you please.'
'The fact is,' gravely remarked Decadi,
'there in no re~embli~nce between the ci'~y
that we heard, and the creaking 0r a doot~'
'Can' it be any thing elsn?' anxiously in-
quired Cecil~.. '  '          ' ' 7
'Bali!' replied Pierre,' yo~ tire mistaken~
all of you. I am right in my conjecture, I
know. Let us wager that you will hear ijo..
thing more after I have shut the stable door.'
'But will you 'agree not to' speak to the
owl if I bet with you?' asked Nicolas.'
'Certainly I will promise not to speak t~
it,' answered the game-keeper, assuming~ a,
ludicrous serio-comic look.
'Very well sir, in that case I bet yOu a
leg of beef, to be eaten on Sunday next at
Vandore's, in Prambourg, that it is a person
who is counterfeiting an owl out there.'
"Done! I take the bet!' said' Pierre'
Aubin shaking the extended hand of Nichias'
Godard.
The affair of the wager being settled, the
game-keeper was' going out of the' house,'
when a thought coming to him he turned back'
to Cecile's room and tenderly embraced ' hi~
wife and Child, then went forth into the yar4~
As he was crossing the threshold, Nicholas
called after him,-
'Remember, if you speak to~ theoWi, ~r
rather, to the pretended owl, the wage~ 4k~


/ ~m~cWded and I win my leg ~mf'beeV
'Pierre Aubin made no reply bnt.wa!kedi
phtowards the place he' had designated.
The company Soofl set agoing- by some
pleasantry of Nicholas', ceased -to hi~tei~ t~
the retreating foot-steps of' the game-keeper,
bnt songe and jokes r~ipidly suceeedihg-e~ch
ntlier, more than a quarter of an hour' elapsed
before any one remarked the length of time
that Pierre had been absent. At lt(st some
one expressed wonder as to what, could be
keeping him so long, and each of the gm~ests
instantly looked as if the same question had
just occurred to him or her.
- -Decadi Robert, setting his glass upenthe
table~,- exclaimed,-.-' I don't approve of this
fun at all, when we are met together to' he-
sodial, n6 slipping away say I. It is y6ur
fault, Nicholas, that Pierre has played us this
~rick,? continued the ex-grenadier of' the
first Consul's guard.'
'Mine l' cried Nicholas astonished at the
accusation.
'That is very unjust. Did I ask him to
go? 'Was it n~t he who bet that it was not
s4~rne joker who was playing s~reeeh-owl,
when-it was quite plain and certain that-.--'
* 'l3e quiet' interrupted Decadi--.' I drink
no more until Pierre is among us and in
or4er to bring him back I will g0 and-look
for him'
As 'Decadi. arose from table on' announi~-
ing his intention, the guests could -d~ -ne' less
than imitate the example of the director' of
the Fete.
What is the matter said' the deaf old bell-
ringer who was quite puzzled to account for
his being left alone at - the 'festive board
where he-h~d eNculated all would 'h~veIre'.
irmined for hours.
'~Wh'mW are -you going to-do?' he"enquir.-
ed.
-- We are~ gQin'g to dance,' shouted Nicho-
las in his ear.

The old'rrman did not hear what Nicholas
said, but as usual ~Ath him he-pretended he
did. On more than one'occaskui that ve~y~
evermiixg- the plougb.boy had made sport of
the bell-ringer's deafness-but in this 'in-
stance those of the corrtpariy who did not
participate in the charm~of Decadi took up'
the-jbke arid repeated the ~words of the jester,
we are going to-dance" so loudly and so
loudly and 'eo often, that they ultimately pe-
netrated the' tympandm~ of the deaf man.
'Very well; I' understand,' said he, 'one
cannot dance without music. Pierre is gope
for the Fiddler.'
Pleased with his penetration, he secured a
fat old body, nearly as deaf as himself, fdr'
his partner in the first cotillion. The women
then repaired to the inner room where Cecile
was in strange agitation at her husband's un.
accountable absence, and the men followed
the old soldier Decadi into the court.
The whole party searched around every-
where; but in vain, and only in whispered
accents had they spoken, fearing to add to
the' alarm of th~ I wife -- when suddenly
Nicholas shouted at the top of his voice-
'Halloo, Pierre, we aratired of seeking you
-speak-tell us where you are.
Decadi rushed on him and covered the
mother of the inconsiderate bawler with
both his hard hands, saying..-.
',Fool that thou art-.-thou wilt terrify my
poor girl.'
The ulisehief was already done, and to the
grief and annoyance of the father, Cecile ap-.-
peared at the door of the house.
In' spite of the entreaties of her friends she
had-thrown off the counterpane and spring.
~ng out of bed, bare-foot and lightly clad~
she reached tie outer door. Her father, with
rough tenderness, caught her in his arms,
saying, as he carried her back t~ bed,-
'What are you thinking of, Lihi? Do you
~pe~t to be a good mother if you take sueb-

freaks -as these? There, take your little pe
and nurse hex; that will be much better that
joining~ in our sports?
'&amp;o. let m~ go father4 There is no spori
in this; something has happened t~ Pierre
and I must know what it is.'
'Nonsense, child? said Decadi, striving t
hide his own rising alarm. 'Nonsense
don't you understand the bellowing of Nicho.
laa? It is only for fun that he goes on so-
he kitows well enough where Pierre~ is, t~pd
so do I. Balanchet told me just now1'
'Well, then,' responded Cediledoubting.
ly, 'if you know, why can't you tell me.'
'No, my darling, I will not tell you any-
thinguntil you are snug in. bed and your
sweet infant in your arms; see, she is awake
apd crying for you.
Greatly puzzled what to saynext was De-
cadi,. but he had gained his point. The
young mother had done as her father insist-
ed, and he had also gained time to re-
flect.
'Now, then, tell me as you promised.-
Where is Pierre gone? You see I am herp,
calm and comfortable.'
'He is gone to St. Frambourg for suga9
and nutmeg to make some punch-.--.that is
all.'
Nichola~ was about to speak, but Decadi
trod heavily on his toe and sternly whisper-
ed,-.-.
'If you cry out or speak a word I will
kill you.'
Cecile seemed dissatisfied with the expla-
nation, so, to pacify her, her father wished
to send off the guests to meet him, for he
sai%1 gaily,-
'Cecile is afraid she may lose her good
man.'
But~no one stirred, and Nicholas, quite
mal-.a.propos, as usual, inquired4-...
',Where must we go for him~ii'
'Where neighbor Balanehet told us, to be

t sure,' said Decadi,, pushing the un1uel~y'
speaker out~of the room, and that with n~
gentle hand.-
'Oh, father!' exclaimed Cecile, 'I know'
that you' are afraid' some evil has befallen
him.'
'If that is the case,' cried the- coward
I Nicholas, '~, for one, will not venture after
him.'
'What, are .you not gone?' interposed
Decade. *I see how it is. You- must have
weapons and lights, soft-hearted chickens that
you are.'
So saying the veteran got a couple of axes,
* a scythe, some cudgels, and a few torches,
and distributing them among the party-so
lately joyous, but now so timorous and de-
jected-.--.he dispatched them on their relu~--
* tant expedition, whilst he remained, he said,
to guard against such another prank as Cecile~
had just played them.
In vain the kind old man tried to soothe
the fears of his daughter, whose anxiety 2
seemed so much greater than so short an ab.
sence would appear to warrant. Her alai~nV
became contagious and her sympathisirig
friends looked upon her compassionately, as
if certain some misfortune had actually' hnp."

Clasping her infant to her breast, at let~~th /
Cecile cast a look of despair on her silent

'It is from thm~t quarter that trouble will I
come. Already has death nearly' reached
us from that side.' .
'Death!' gasped out her aifrighted corn-
panions.
'Great God! is my child going out o
senses?'
Cecile understood her father's meaning,
and replied,.-

did noi.~knoW of it, father, for Pierre wished
me iiot'to tell. Stay, do you only raise the
little picture of the Virgin. There, where
the iiead'of my bed used to be. That ~ic-
tu~'e~h~etds something, doe&amp;it not V
The father removed the picture, but as
the wall was in the shade he did not discover
anything, so he replied,-.-.
'No, child! I see nothing.'
'T~ake the light, then, and look again; I
promise you will see something.'
'Decadi brought the light and holding' it
dlose to the wIAall, he exclaimed, in utter
amazement,
'Sacrc-bteu! why here is a rifle ball sunk
in the wall. What wretch took aim at such
a mark?'
* '~1'hat is what Pierre must know, but he
will not say. As for me, however, I can
guess.
Oh, for goodness sake! do tell us,' cried
the assembled group.
'Yes, Cecile-speak. Let us hear the
name,' 'added Decadi.
'No, my dear father, I can not-I must
not, until Pierre ,gives me permission. I've
promised him not to name any one whom 1
may suspect.'
'This is showing too much pity for a mi~-
erabie wretch-a Awould-be' murderer, me-
thinks,' observed the old soldier,. 'However
powerful he may be, Pierre need' not fear
him. One man has as good a chance as
another.'
Cecile only replied, in alow voice,-..K
"Perhapp it was 'not a man!'
No one spoke.
Decadi Robert remained some time gaz-
ing on the ball, then placing the light on the
table,"he'iit to the little window and stood
looking into the thick darkness that envelop~
ed the"bnilding.
&amp;~dre~ry hillf hour passed thu~ in agoniz-

in~ .suspense,' which momentarily became
more intense.
At length the words, 'They come-they
are returning!' broke from tIm lips of the
listening either, in feverish accents.
The lights drew nearer rapidly.
Cecile, withoutt rising, t~oked at her father
beseechingly, and in stitjed tones, said,-
'Pierre, my husband; is he with thee?'
The old man' leaned out of the window, the
better to~ be able to distinguish those who
were advancing.
'And my husband?' again implored Ce-
eile.
Decade Robert, who' could not see more
than the outline of the figures, would have
,called out, but his voice failed him, he was
speechless from emotion-for, alas, the ab-
sence of alacrity and exultation in the ap-
proaching party proclaimed too clearly, to
the anxious watcher, the want of success they
had to announce.
'And my husband?' ejaculated Cecile, for
the third time.
I do not see him yet,' replied her father,
~ evident emotion.
Again the agitated young woman sprang
from' her bed.
The old man quitted his post at the win-
dow and rushed to oppose the entrance of
the crowd into his daughter's presence until
he should have learned the result of their
search.
But he was too late. Cecile in her eager-
ness was not to be baffled. She caught
I~icholas, who was foremost, by the arm,
and demanded,-
'What has happened? What have you
seen?'
The plough-boy was pale as a corpse, and
Ipoked terribly scared. Heeding not the
signalss made by Decadi Robert, for~ him not
to tell, he bluntly'answered,-
'The fact is, we do not know what has

become of Pierre. He has not been at S~.
Frambourg, at all events, and at the 'cross-'
roads near the forest, we saw the hedges
beaten down and traces of men and horses,
in mnch confusion, as if there had been a
terrible scuffle going on in that place quite
recently.'
'0 Heaven! robbery or murder!' cried
Cecile, in' bitterangaish.
'No, the rascals were not robbers,' rejoin-
ed Nicholas. 'Pierre had no money about
him, or anything worth stealincr. but his
handkerchief he has lost, for we found it in
a ditch close to the place of the squabble, or
fight, or whatever it was. See, here it is,
there is no mistake but it is it, look and you
will know it.'
As he spoke, the fellow drew from his
pocket a neck-kerchief, twisted, knotted and
torn in many places.
Father Decadi stretched 'out his hand to
get hold of it, in hopes of'persuad'ing his poor
daughter that Nicholas was mistaken; but
Cecile, quicker than he, seized on the crimi-
nating article.
With trembling fingers she unfolded it ;
then, 'examining it at 'the light, she discover-
ed the marks of the teeth and traces of foam
and blood, indicating that~' in a desperate
struggle, it had b'een used as a gag to stifle
the cries of the victim.
As this conviction forced itself upon her,
a cry of agony' and despair escaped the mis-
erable wife, who pronouncing, with ineffable
terror, the name, 'Regina Gazeran,' fell ~
fainting and senseless' into the arms of her I
commiserating and astounded friends. '' t
The father lett her to the care of these
kind 'folks, and in a frenzy 'of fury 'he caught ~
hold of the~'bearer of this ill news and al.. -

you no bowels of compassion, no spark of~
courage and humanity? I will show' y~3iP

This spoken, the 'old soldier released

The rest, stimulated by the excitement antI'
determination of the old man; thought not of'
his insulting reproaches and each seeing 'in
the eyes of his associates that 'they were all
of one mind, they 'followed iu the rear of
Cecile's father, to participate in this strange
nocturnal chase.

time, recovered the vigor of youth, so agi~e~y

s~nne little distance from the ground, and
w~s steadily moving in the direction of the
village.
Without heeding the repeated calI~ of his
eornrades, Decadi follows the wandering
light ~~oma distance until he judg~d that it
was within range of his gun; then, acting
without reflection, under the savage iuiputse
of~his excited 'feelings, he took good aim at
t~ light and pulled the trigger.
The report resounded through the valley.,
th~ light was extinguished, and a cry, as of
sudden pain was distinctly heard in the dark..
ness.
'I have hit the bird, and must wait for my
cox~rades to confe up with their torches, so~
li~oquized Decadi.
t'I~h' party soon hurried up, and together
they all hastened to the spot from whence
* tl~e cry had proceeded and where the' light
vanished.
Nothing was to be found but a lantern,

appeal., he had abruptly quitted the christen-
ing festival.
But, before explaining the cause of this
~r~y~erious disappearance, permit us' to. re-
late what occurred to him on that memorable
night.
When Pierre Aubin, in great emotion, had
taken leave of~ his wife and babe and quitted
the cottage, as already mentioned, instead pf
going to the stable-~-.as his fatiher-in-law and
the. guests supposed was his intention, being
misted as to the true object of his absence-
Pierre passed through the outer gate of the
court-yard and was at once in the open
country.
The night being so very dark, or~ coming.
from the light within, it took some time be-
fore he could make his.way through the sur-
rounding obscurity.
Behind, his cottuge-honie shed its friendly
rays, lil~e a Pharos of the deep, and by this
aid he trusted to be able, on returning, to
guide his steps to all that his heart held
dear.
PIerre had proceeded but a shot t dist~mJ4ce
when he saw, not far from him, a light.--
Three times it slowly raised on high, and
three times it is as slowly ~owdred.

'Good!' thought he, 'I am not far fron

no sound was to be' heard.
At this straiige silence he became perplex-

his steps on the 'slightest' 'suspicious move-

was heazd cjpse at han~l.

So saying, he i'ose up, hid, the lantern un-

treaties of Pierre, he fled like a deer, and~ was
i~istantly lost in the idarkn~ss
Le~t thi~is sud~ply alone, without having
7'
heard a word of the importan~ int~lIigence
which he sought to learn, Pierre bent his ear
the ground to ascertain whether the noise
which had' put to flight the foolish boy did
'proceed from h0rse's hoofs, or was
m~e1y produced by the wind through the
trees. Nothing but the howling of a siriart
0.
breeze, at first met his~ ear, but after a mo-.
merit he 7.distinctly heard the neighing of a
1~orse-4hen all was again silent.
'~'h~ l~ors~mer ave halted, thought Pierre,
a~d reverting to the singular demeanor, and
abrupt departure of Petit Chauvel~he became
i~neasy. He looked towards his cottage, the
light f~orn which was barely visible' and he
approached himself for having imprudently
wandered so far from it.
For a second time did the stout-hearted
g~mmp~keeper feel ,the fearful presentiment
wWch had drawn him~ to Cecile and Phili-
berte, but resolutely be began to walk home-
'v~~ards. As lie was going he heard a sound
as of stealthy'steps on the grass, and the
c~ack1jng of dry br~iches, sometimes on
onps~de and then on the other-but it was
i~1e~s straining his vision, nothing could he
4iscetn except once? a shadow seemed to
g~im~e aloi~g the ,path-way.
'Who g~es'there?' said the gamekeeper
boldly, ,as he walked towards the moving
figure. No. answer~ was returned ..r- the
sha~lo~ se,~med to have sunk into the earth.

Pierre advanced a step nearer the s ot and
again challenged with the practiced v~ice of
a ~oldier-' 'Who~goes there?' .
Hardly had he uttered the last word when,
from different points four men rushed on him,
surrounded, and violently assaulted him.
The husband of Cecile was uncommonly
tall and, what is rare, strong in proportion to
his height. He had mote than once had to
contend with the most athletic and most des-
perate, poachers, and had'taught them that in
a handeto hand encounter, when he could
see what he was about, he did not fear two
foes at once. But what could he do when
taken by surprise, in the dark, and attacked
'by four resolute assassins'?
The almost superhuman efforts of despair
cotild not save him. Being convinced that
he must be overpowered, iPierre, after fighting
manfully for some time in silence, attempted
to call for help, but a gag stopped his m~puth.
Putting forth all his strength in order, if pos-
sible, to free himself from, the suffocating
impediment, the game-1~eeper by a mighty
effort freeing one hand for a moment, he
tore away the gag.
This was his own neck handkerchief,
which Nicholas Godard found shortly after-
wards on the scene of strife, and which he
bro~ight back to the young mother.
As soon as Pierre Aubin recovered the
power of frep respiration, he felt stronger,
and with a fearful blow in the chest of, one~
his adversaries, he felled him to the ground
-but unfortunately the man in falling had
caught hold of the game-keeper and drag-
ged him down with himself.
Pierre was uppermost 'and kept the other
down, who not vanquished, though under.
neatl?, clung so firmly to, him as to' prevent
his rising up. Thus interlaced in a nervous~
embrace, equally trying to both; they rolled
and struggled on;the ground.
Each could count the deep-drawn respira-

with knee to kn~e,'breast to bi~e~st, and fa

ed hitn to let go his hold and tied his han
behind his back, and stopped the victim
mouth with another gag. The' man thus r4
leased by comrades was able to arise, and
his turn assist them.
Pierre Auhin, still Iaying'oh the groun
and kept in a painful position by strong cori
found it impossible to give utterance to mor
than stifled sighs. Two of the men no~
to4k hold of his legs, as yet unfastene(i
whilst the other' two supported hi~ head an
'shoulders. Sometimes carrying, sometime
dragging him along the 'gr'ound,'they got hin
to a short distance where the party h'ahed.'
One of them gave a whistle and alinost in
stantly a fifth (masked~)' person, appeared
leading a horse by the bridle.
This latter accomplice was 'small, thick-se'
and short. He seemed to move with diffi'
culty. possibly y it was' on account 'of hi's in
firmity that he had not taken part 'in th'c
struggle. He held the bridle whilst the 'cow.

the villains, the very hor5lis -assisted in pre.
serving the 4eath-Iike silence. No neigh, or
restless stamping betrayed to the anxious
searchers their vicinity.
* The last hope of deliverance ~lies in the
heart of the captured man as the lights re-
cede, and the voices of the noisy party led
by Decadi are faintly borne on the night-
breeze.
Once more the midnight marauders are
under way,, they have returned to ihe path,
the leader has re-lit his torch, and away they
gallop at a pace that will soon put them be-
yond all danger of a rescue.
As for Pierre, each moment he expected to
*draw his last breath. His head swam, his
eyes were extremely bloodshot and painful.-
1~l~e clouds, seemed to fly above his head, and
the trees were dancing in confusion, as, lay-
ing in that uncomfortable position, he whiz-
zed pa~t theufi. He seemed transported to
an unknown worht, where everything was
strange, fantastic, inverted, and in constant
motion.
For ~vo weary hours did this unnatural
,Cour~e last, at the end of which time they
halted.
Pierre was released from the horse and laid
on the ground.-Then his feet were tied to-
gether, and he conjectured that his riding was
over, 'But whn~t,' thought he, 'are they
going to do with me?'
The leiu~Ier of the masked party pli~ced his
hr~nd on the heart of tbe prostrate man, to
ascertain if he yet breathed.
This certainty obtained, Pierre was imme-
diately blindfolded. Then four of the men
raised him from 4te gr9~nd ~nd ,9!irried him,
he~d~o~em9st, after having turned themselves
around with their burden several times, to

prevent the unlikely possibility of his having
had presence o(mind, or perception enough
to recognize the route they -had come. tI'he
'deformed one remained
of the horses.~ , probably to dispbse
Pierre Aubin, exhausted by the rough
transportation and the struggle that had pre-
ceeded it, as well as the whirl in which his
senses had been kept-utterly weakened in
body, but fearless in mind-listened with in-
tense curiosity for some indication of what
kind of a place he was in.
At first, as they proceeded (carrying him
along) he knew by the footstep~ that the soil
was sandy.
Presently they trod on harder ground, and
after a while'firmly, as on flagstones.' When
they had advanced a little farther they stop-
ped, but it was only to change the position of
the prisoner.
Two men went in front and took firm
hold of his feet, and the other two supporting
his head and shoulders, they resumed their
march.
By the slanting position of his body, and
the jerks he felt at each step they took, Pierre
surmised that they were descending a stair.
way. ~He was sensible of the cold, damps of I
a subterranean passage.                  4
He no longer felt the outer air breathing
on his face, and drying the perspiration that
rolled profusely from' his forehead, as at'in- I
tervals, during the transit, had been th~
ease.
Now, indeed, was the bold huntsman seized
witha shiver of terror. He thought they I
might be bringing him ALIVE to this place,
to let him die of hunger and despair in a I
j** tomb!
Onward they moved in the depths of this
long, subterranean vault, and by and by, the t
distantt strains of joyous music reached the ii
ear of the b~iwildered Pierre.,     '  '
'Can this be possible, or is it but the' ilIu- a
sion of a confused brai~i? Am I going crazy?'
thought he. '
But nearer and clearer does the music b
sound, and at length there could be no doubt h
on the poor fellow's mind that he actually a
heard a full orchestra-yet how strange I- d
where could he be?          .
Again his' posture was shifted, and tIi~
gui'me-keeper was 'carried horizontally. 'lie d
felt that his 'bearers were walking ott level ei
ground, but their feet slipped, as ifit Were ti

darn p and slimy. A smell, as if light and air
frtd long been excluded, pervaded the place,
and ~was 'almost'suffoeaming.'
Here the four 'men paused, but within
setting down the heavy burden they had car-
ried so far..
Pierre could distinguish a key grating in a
lock, then belts creaked in the rusty staples,
and a door o.'as forced open.
From the different sound of the echoing
footsteps, and the stoeping'gtit of his captors,
it was plain that they were passing through a
low door-way which, it appeared, led into .a
vaulted passage, somesteps below that 'thro'
which they had just come.
A second door was opened with a similar
noise. 'They crossed another threshold, after
which the four enemies of the game-keeper
of the forest of Brasseuse, stopped 'for the'
last time.
The victim of the ambush was deposited
on the damp ground, his eyes were unban-
daged, and as soon na Pierre recovered from
the dazzling light of the torch, distinguish.
ad the masked figures who stood around hjrn,
contemplating hirni' in silence.
Lie next turned to survey the place where
he had been thus ~forci bly conveyed, 'and
Ireary was the spot.
It was a vault, the shape of which was
)ctagonal. The only door was narrow and
ow.
Pierre felt convinced that this was the first
ime he'd ever been in it, but, from the gene~
al resemblance that such places so frequent.
y bear to each other, he could not gleam any
information as to whose castle he mi~ht
ue in.
still was to be heard, overhead, resound.
ng in the gloomy stillness of the. dungeons
he harmonious cadence of ~he music that
ad already caught the' attetition of the cap-
itte.-.and also the regular 'measured move-.
aents of a dance.
After the rnaskers 'had regarded Pierre for

;:Noticing, shortly, ,a glimmer .of light pro. ~
feedingg .frtm without and visible beneath the s
door; an invincible desire to ascertain, what
~wi%~oing 6n there, prompted the prisoner to
.inttkie, a'nattemnpt'to find it out, S
By the help of head and knees, his hands
un4' feet being tied, he managed to move
.along, somewhat in 'the fashion of a worm, ~
toward the open space l~elow the door.
Placing his'.eye against the, aperture, he
saw the ft~ur masked men seated at a stone
table, evidently in deiberation. They spoke
one after another, in low tones, as if each was
deJiver~ing an important opinion. Then' they
were silent, and appeared as if expecting the
entrance ofsonie one.
~sV~f might Pierre imagine that the con~
versatiorf deeply concerned himself, but in
vain he tried to catch a word of it.
It was but a few minutes ere the fifth ac- 4
coruplice joined his associates. This was the
dwarf who had, with a refinement of cruelty
and malice, acted the part of nightmare 1
during the journey, and had 'been left to take
care of the horses.
fle seated himself beside the other and
spoke vehemently, but inaudibly to Pierre.-
When he had7 finished his, harangue, which
was listened to with great attention, the party
arose.' The nocturnal council seemed to be
terminated.
At this momelit, so interesting and excit-
ing to the spectator of the scene, he heard a
rap on the outer door of the mysterious coun-
cil vault.
The most powerful-looking of the five men
had left'iiis place and was advancing towards
the door of the prisoner's cell when this oc-
curred, ~a~d Pierre, fearing to be surprised in
his indiscreet capacity of eaves-dropper, and
thinking that his life, might depend on his ig-
norance of what had just passed, drew back
as;quickly as 'he was able, to the place where
he had been left.
it may be assumed that situated as was
R~ierre Aubin, and with such intemltions as he
peeds must attribute to his enemies, he had
little hope of life-~.but yet for 'the sake of
wife aud'~child he was willing' to endure a
great ,deul rather than~die. '
Having regained his place he waitedin
in breathless suspence.~-but iw one enteted.
Nothing hut.the'strains of loud 'music and
cadenced steps above, met his' strainedl e~r.
I'he light still showed beneath the~door, and

L5~IOUS curiosity prevailed over evei'y con-
ideration, so again his painful way was
na~le to the ill-fitting door.
This time he found a new personage was
Ldded to the masked party-A ,woman~(
Pierre could not see her face, for it was
urned towards the men to whom she was
peaking, to low, however, to be heard by
uin~, though her gestures denoted auge: and
~ resolute imperious will.
The lady was in aA'ashionable ball-dress,
dazzling, covered with diarhonds, her hair
was ornamented ~vith rich and rare flowers,
.n her hand was even yet the Bouquet de
Ball, and her magnificent shoulders were
lisplayed by her low-necked dress. This
splendid creature must have stolen away
~rom the assembly over head to be present
it the secret council which probably was to
Kiecide, for life or death, the fate of the
wretched man
When the lady had finished speaking ~he
Lowed graciously to the five masks, and left
the vault.
The heart of Pierre Aubin bounded with-
in his bosom as he saw her fhce; it confirmed
his, suspiciQns. He uttered in under tones,
and with violent emotion, the same name
that Cecile in her despair had involuntary
spoken-' Regina Gazeran!'
The leader of the party accompanied this
lady to the floo?, locked and bolted it after
her, then pointing to the vault where Pierre
was confined he took hold of the lighted torch
and moved towards it. No sooner did the
captive-game-keeper seen this motion than he
regained his station and awaited his fate.
The five men entered together. A ring
it appeared was fastened in the wall, and to
it Pierre was quickly fastened with a strong
chain,:they all then drew up before him, and
the chief stepped up to the victim and gave
him a blow on the cheek~
At this unmrinly insult the blood boiled in
the veins of the injured man, he foamed at
the mouth, but the excess of indignation de-
prived him of the power of speech. To such
a brave and worthy man as Pierre 4ubin, to
bear this wtta indeed torture. As he trem-
bled with impotent rage he heard a derisive
laugh; it proceeded from the mslicious
4warf.
'Eacli successively approached, and in like
manner gave the unfortunate man a blow,
even the hatE~ful little man, but when his

U

REGINA.

turn came, the better to enjoy the atrocious
* pleasure of the insult, he stood looking m
Pierre earnestly, then with mock pity h
wiped, with his own handkerchief, the col
sweat of anguish from his brow and the tear
of blood from his eyes, then completed a]
by the shameful blow.
This strange and ignoble infliction ended
the four .strong cavaliers knelt in the centr
of the vault and by their united efforts, am
with help of an iron bar, they raised a ston
which had been concealed under the well
packed earth which formed the floor of th4
vault.
A dark gulf was opened beneath. and
mephitic vapor exhaled from the aperture.
Pierre uttered a cry of horror. rfhe musi
and dancing were still sounding with over
powering din. But ere the cry could be re
pleated, the wretches seized their helpless
victim, suspended him by cords attached tc
The t?~ongs which confined his arms and legs,
and slowly lowered him into the dungeon-
abyss.
When Pierre. reached the bottom of this
horrible pit, the stone that had*covered it
was replaced, and the unfortunate man fonnd
himself alone, and now, at last hopeless!
'My wife! My child!' he exclaimed; but
this was all that escaped fro118 his almost
bursting heart.
During the xvh'1e of this~ foul transaction
the prisoner had been unable to recognize
his tormentors, whose voices he had not
heard, and whose features had been effec-
tually concealed by the masks. Nevertheless
suspicion of certain persons most likely to be
the actors or bettors in the dastardly deed,
would intrude, but he repulsed the idea, that
it could be them, with horror.
After the receding steps of his foes ceased
to be heard, all was silent. This silence was,
however, but of short duration, and he could
make out that some one was in the vault
above him. Then he distinguished~ that the
stone over his sepulchre was shaken, as if by
some one whose strength was unequal to the
task of raising it up, for it resisted the efforts
to displace it.
Hope, the sufferer's steadfast companion,
whispered in the ear of the buried-alive. Is
it a deliverer?
Re-animated by this idea, Pierre aroused
himself.
The efforts of the person, to move the

21

s stone, continued. At length it is partially
tt displaced, and the light of the torch which
e the stranger had brought, shed its rays into
~l the gloomy dungeon. 'Courage friend,'
s cried Pierre looking up to' his supposed liber-
1 ator. The stone gives way, but instead of a
friendly face, as the game-keeper had hoped
to discern-behold a hideous mask. Doubt-
e less it is one of the wretches returned to feast
I his eyes on his victim, for he holds the light
~ over the yawning chasm and peeps into the
- gloomy death.
3   ' Cowardly assassin,' cried Pierre, £ At
last tell me thy name that Imay curse it.'
t The sneering laugh which was the sole
reply to these words, revealed the malicious
Dwarf who had already caused him so much
suffering.
* The monster of cruelty rts if, for the time
satisfied with the spectacle he had been en-
joying was withdrawing himself, when his
mask came off and fell at the feet of Pierre
Aubin.,
The dwarf hastily sprang backwards-but
quick as was the movement, he was recog-
nised!
Antoine de Labourdilliere,' cried the
game-keeper, 'Remember that from the days
of Gain-God punishes the fratricide I'
CHAPTER iii.
BEFORE proceeding any farther with the
story it may be well fo affix the date of it,
by mentioning that at this period Charles the
Tenth had been five yekrs on the throne of
France.
The eldest branch of the house of Bour-
bon was verging to a fall-thanks to the
combined efforts of those who wished, at
any cost, to destroy it, and those who, un~jer
pretence of' preserving it from unseemly
contact, kept at a distance all who were
inclined to afford it substantial support.
It was about fifteen years since the new
alliance had proclaimed, by its heralds, ~o
the absentees, the last lingerers of the
great emigration-'Donnez nous la peine
d'entrer,' which may be translated 'Be pleas-.
'ed t~ come back.' '
From 'that time a goodly number of the'
noble descendants of ancient races had re-
turned to live on their estates, for the most
part in a pitiful condition. They were as
one may say, wedded to the past, and could


not be brought to understand the changes
and revolutions that time had wrought in
social life and public opinion. Acting as
thoug.h~ these things were not, they obsti-
nately retained their old ways and customs
brought back, intact, from exile:
In their simplicity these providcial gentry
and nobility expected to see renewed the
splendor and the arbitrary usages of abso-
lute monarchy. They refused to comply
with the fashion of the day, even in the
natter of dress. Some repaired their delap-
itated castle-towers and re-erected the sig-
niorial gibbets.
The latter-an object of derision ~o those
who, passing the castle, perceived it through
the court-yard gate-was not altogether. an
unused plaything. If deprived of the right
to exercise sovereign power, the dispossessed
noble could rio longer jiang on it a truly
refractory tenant-he consoled himself for
his loss of power over the lives of men, by
hanging, now and then, some intractable
hound to serves a warning to the pack~
Amongst these incorrigibles-who made
it a point of honor not to admit the march
of improvement, and to protest, by their
influence and practise, against all innova-
tions and every species of reform-it con-
cerns us to instance, as foremost, Emeric, Ne-
pomucene de Labourdilliere, Marquis of
Yalgenist.
The domain possessed by his ancestors
was so vast, that it was said, that from sun
rise to sunset, a ho;se urged to a gallop, and
continuing at that pace, could hardly make
th~ circuit of it. But the evil days that-
came on the territorial Lords had so often
and so effectually clipped here-and there
from the manor of Valganest, that when *h~
Marquis found himself, at the* restoration,
again in possession of the 'estate and title
of his fore-fathers, the inheritance was re-
d~iced to such a degree, that- a very mod-
erate walker would, have gained but a poor
appetite~ if he satisfied himself with making
the toiit~ of the* new Valganest, before his
breakfast.
The Marquis derived but a very small
income from his curtailed estate but, proud
and poor, he would have considered his dig-
nity compromised had he permitted hi~ far-
trier to cultivate the smallest portionn of the
ground assigned, since, his return to Valge-
riest, to his game. Whilst he exacted rigid

respect to the boundaries ~f his preserves in
order to secure his own sport, he was utterly
unscrupulous about the rights and property
of his neighbors, and Emeric de Litbourdil.
here encroached perpetually, with spade and
plough,' on the limits which he deemed too
circumscribed.
As all the land that could be seen around
the castle had once belonged to his ances-
tors, the Marquis called encroachments en
the adjacent fields-practical experiments of
counter-revolution. By little an(I little he
would, no doubt, have got back all the
patrimony of the Labourdilliere family if
those whom he ik~rong-ed, by putting in prac-
tise his political theory, had not loudly
spoken of having recourse.to law, to obtain
justice, and ascertain how far this system cf
appropriation and aggrandizement would be
sanctioned.
The first peasant who had dared to com-
plain to the old gentleman had done so on
the occasion of chancing to meet him. Very
greatly astonished was the Marquis at his
presumption and audacity. This surprise is
easily accounted for.' He had returned to
his old castle after an absence of thirty
years, and -understood not the vocabulary
i~rhich the French people had -composed for
themselves whilst passing through-Repub-
lic, Gonsuh~te and Empire! -
The Marquis de Valganest, challenged by
the old clown, looked at him with an air as
much as to say, 'I do not understand ~ou:
Then as he had no desire to waste time in
listening to claims put forth in terms equally
new to him, he shrugged Ii is shoulders and
turned on his heel.
After going a few steps the Marquis hap-
pened mechanically to look back. - The
claimant was still standing where he had
left him-but cursing and shaking his braw-
ny fist in a threatening manner
It was not long before the countryman
felt the ill effects of this significant but dis-
respectful - gesture, which was more intelli-
gible to the Marquis than had been his
language.
On the evening of that very day, as the
man was going front the Hamlet of Bras.
seuse, through thi wood of Haut Martel, he
was assaulted by some persons, so disguised
that he could not recognize them, anu
beaten with clubs till he was completely
senseless. To crown his misfortune, a short

REGINA.                      23

time afterwards, his finest stack of cora was
struck by lightning (it was said) and con-
sumed. As the night was free from thunder
or storm, some of the oldest and most inde-
pendent minds in the place would not believe
that the interposition of Heaven caused the
disaster-but the servant girl of the Priest
of St. Frambourg took her oath,. that she
saw the avenging lightning descend from
Heaven on the doomed stack, and on the
following Sunday the miracle was proclaimed
as Sacred 'Truth.
This occurrence, which might have been
~u effectual warning to the malcontents, - did
not prevent another peasant, more audacious~
even than the former, from doing that which
the one who had been so roughly beaten had
only threatened to perform.
Complaint ~vas carried before the prose-
cuting attorney for the crOwn, at Senhis.
The unlucky constable who was not afraid
to carry to the Marquis the summons to
appear before the court to hear himself
condemned to keep within his own bounda-
ries, could not boast of the result of this
daring exploit.
The easily irritated pride of the old gcn~
tlenran, who was altogether ignorant of legal
proceedings, took umbrage when be saw a
fellow present himself to enunciate an order
in a castle (where, except during the revo-
lution when things had to be passed over,)
no one had assumed the right to enter, save
to humble themselves before their master.
When the constal)le entered the saloon;
Emeric de Labourdilliere was surrounded by
his five grand-sons-William, James, Fran-
cis, Honore and Antoine. -
We ought here to observe that it was no
parr of the intention of the official, entrusted
with this delicate mission,- to adventure into
the interior of the castle in the execution of
his duty-on the contrary he only desired to
deliver his summons into the hands of the
gate-keeper.
To this effect he had already, in this lady's
kennel, produced his inkstand, and, the pen
in his fingers, -was beginning to write in the
prescribed French form- 'Speaking to the
gate-keeper who has declared herself unwil-
ming to sign the--' ~vhen an old servitor
appeared at the gate of the lndge and
invited maitre Bonaccueji to follow him into
the presence of Monseigneur. ' --
The invitation was so politely worded and

I

delivered in such mild tones, 'that 'it cduld
not fail to succeed in entrapping him. -
Eustache Jlonaccueil, the contable, a~as
i.~aught by it. He ascended the grand~ stair- -
case with unfalte~ing step, passed through -
the large apartments, that led to the saloon
where the old man, awaited him, without
hesitation-but no sooner was he ii, the ~e-
sence of the Marquis than -his confidei~e
began  to  fail.  '    -  -           -  - -
The aspect of the grandsoii~ 'df the Mar-
quis made the constable uneasy, and' the
haughty ironical looks of the old matf~
caused iiini to dread soxiie evil intentich on -
his part. Very soon was he enlightened oTh
the subject, for hardly had maitre Bonaccueil -
presented, with fear and tremeling, his ciii-' -
tion, to his lordship, when he found himself -
pinioned in the strong embrace of vigdrous~
arms. In a second he was stripped (,Fhi~S
clothing, then he was pitilessly fiog~ed~ a~d~
without giving him time to dress himself, the -
five young men, with shouts of lau~lhter,
turned him out of doors. -
The cold was intense, 'but th~ constable
felt it not, thanks t6 the kind attention of th&amp;"'
old domestic who let loose a couple of
hounds which worried and harassed him fob' -:
a quarter of a league.
This repetition of an infamous amusement, ,
which had often been acted in old times -
with success, cost the Marquis dear, in thq
present instance. In the meaiitime how- -
ever, he was glad to h~re an ojportuhity'-
ci showing~ the heirs of his name - hoiV this
sort of thing used to be aranaged.
The poor devil of a constable tva~ hunted
by the dogs so far' that- even after they had
ceased to persecute him and' he was beyond
their reach, he continued his xac~, thinking
they were at his heels, and smaiting from the
wounds their pangs had infliefed, utitil he
fell exhausted and senseless at his own
door.
The neighbors raised him from the ground
tad' placed him in bed. Nine days alter
hat the unfortunate man died ot dd~rious
fever.
In days of yore it 'wouk~ only have cost
the Marquis some twelve hundred francs to
put a stop to the hub-bub excited - by sui~h a
result to a similar pleasantry.-.--but time ha~I
made every thing' dea.rer, even to the life of - -
a constable~ So much - so that the old
Noble, - who had not calculated the eff~ts

of revolutions, saw himself on the point of
piiying with his liberty and honor, for this
error in his reckoning.
A criminal trial was in store for him, and
the Gendarmerie had already crossed the
threshold of' the castle to arrest its lordly
owner~.
Emeric de Labourdilliere saw, from his
windows, the police penetrate insolently even
to the court of Honor. He turned a look of
despair on the portraits of his ancestors as
though to implore aid to repel the intrud-
ers.
Some ages back, in the good old times,
ih9trumpet's spund from the towers of Val-
gariest would have sufficed to call numbers
to the defence of 'the castle, and prepared to
hold out to the death, or at least to fight
long and valiantly before they yielded. But
now resistance iva s impossible from without
-and within the Marquis had not even his
five grandsons to assist him-they were ab-
sent on a hunting party.
As the Brigadier and his men mounted
the steps of the hall-door, indignation and
shame at his lost power and present impo-
tence caused the bl~od to mount to the head
A' the old man. Regret for past times was
is last thought-he exclaimed-' Unhappy
rance 1-Unhappy age 1' and apoplexy e-
guished his life on the spot as these words
assed his lips.
When the Gendarmes entered the room
hey, found only a corpse, the clenched fists
nd curved lips of which seemed yet to pro-
st against the sacrilegious proceedings of
evolutionary justice.
This event put an end to judicial action
the matter, for Eustache Bonaccueil had
ied without being able formally to declare
at the grandsons of the deceased Marquis
ad taken an active part in the brutal treat-
ent he had experiencqd. Besides, the old
rvant,' Bartholomew, (out of respect to the
emory of his late master) deposed on oath
at the constable went away from the cas-
dressed and unhurt, after leaving the
tatior. He, also, took the precaution to
atter in the woods through which the'
~used man fled~ the missing garments
ore~er the public vQice accused the de-
ased of no~ having ~qxercised his authority
ry leniently1 s~ that a11 put.~ together, it
gait t~ be generally credited vh~t the con-
ble had been way-laid,) by some one who

bore him ill-will, and thus cruelly treated on
his way back from the castle.
The widow who had flattered herself with
the hope of obtaining heavy damages, reaped
nothing from the event, bat freedom to take
a young husband, which, shortly she did, in
the person of the head-clerk of the deceased
maitre Boneccucil.
We will now go back to the period when
th~ old ~Iarquis with his five grandsons,
just returned from exile, we' e again in pos-
session of Valganest. Thus re-installed, the
proud old gentleman Aelighted to sit in state
in the largest reception room, (as his fore-~
fathers had done,) even when there was no
no company at the castle.
One evening, as he and his family were
thus seated, Bartholomew came into the
apartment and respectfully whispered to his
master.
The valet seemed nervous and embar-
rassed. The Marquis knit his brows at the
communication. Surprise, indecision, an'
ger, all were depicted in his countenance.
Some violent struggle convulsed his features
and lit up his little grey eyes with fury.
Meanwhile Bartholomew awaited patiently
the answer which his master hesitated to
give.
At length the faithful domestic was dis-
missed, the Marquis, saying, 'Mind that he
waits until I ring, before he enters here.'
Then it was a visitor whom the man had
announced. Yes! an embarrassing and un-
welcome one, as will be seen.
The five brothers looked with 'impatience
at their grandfather~, but restrained by the
habitual respect to which he had accustomed
them, they did not venture to interrogate
him-and yet they were no longer youths.
William and James, twins, had entered on
their twenty-ninth year, and Antoine the
youngest, the deformed, the same who had
been recognized by the captive game-keeper
was about twenty-four.
The Marquis at last thus deigned to ex-
plain-' This is an unlucky day for us, gen
tlemen-for I have just had an extraordinary
~mnd vexatious visit announced. If the man,
who is about to present himself, really be
the person he represents-then the late Mar-
chioness of Valganest shed torrents of~ tears
without cause, arftl for nothing have you
worn mourning for these eighteen years.'
T~e brothers trembled at this announce-

REGINA.

ment, and notv their looks demlinded explicit
information, to which mute appeal the Mar-
quis responded in ~tones of vexation.
'He who is coming calls himself, Etienne
de Labourdilliere.' 'Our Father!' exclaimed
each of the young men risifig up.
'Yes, truly, if' he be not an impostor, we
are compelled, once more, to see the wretch-
ed man who has disgraced our name.'
'He must be an impostor,' quickly replied
Antoine, the dwarf His four brothers
catching and applauding the idea, repeated,
'He must be an impostor-He shall be
an impostor.
The whole five gentlemen then approached
the old man's chair and ranged themselves
about him, as if to show by this action that
they made common cause with the head of
the fa'nUy against this new comer, be he
Etienne de Labourdilliere or not.
Well pleased to see those whom he had
taken such pains to inspire, from infancy 1
with pride of birth, love for the old systeur,
and hatred to Republican and Imperial I
Frauce-Erneric smiled his satisfaction, and "~
pulling the bell, muttered between his teeth
'This man may come.'
To make the scene, that is to follow, in- I
telligible, we must premise that Etienne de
Labourdilliere, who emigrated in 1791, left I
his 'vife Marguerite de Gazeran and his three
sons, with his father, in England, and him- c
self returned to his native land as a spy and t
secret emissary to aid the restoration of r
Monarchy.
That the hopes, honors, and emoluments r
held out as inducements to this perilous un-
dertaking (liable to be repaid by ignominious
death) lirompted many to adventure in the t
cause' of the Bourbons, is very probable, t
But that some few were actuated by the
purest motives of loyalty, sw~iyed by convic~ p
tion, and uninfluenced by selfish or interested, ~
motives, it can not be denied-and these u
accepted the commission of Espionnage as
a glorious one, and regarded death in this p
connection as martyrdom. ' ' c
Of this class was the only son of Emeric. tI
When he quitted l~ngland to' counter-revo-
lutionize France-he believed lie was obey~. ~J
'ing a chivalrous sentiment agreeable to Qod ci
and beneficial to hiseountry. But the pre- d's
juice of education gave way before the r
glorious 'tictS and deeds he witnessed or tli
heard related on his way to~Paris. Long he ai

struggled consejentiously to repress the eh-
thusiasm which by degrees took possession
of him.
A plot, to murder his first consul, one in
which he was compromised 'without having
participated in it'-.-finished to disgust hidj
and detach him from a cause which allowed
of' assassination as a means to attain success.
He had the courage to express his indigiia
tion at the conventicle from whence the
death-signal was to be issued. His accom,
places (who had in the first place deceived
him as to their true intentions) fancying
themselves betrayed by him on whom they
so much relied, came very near making hifit
pay with his life, his rupture with therri
Etienne de Labourdilliere was tiot 'th~
man to be easily intimidated, and when he
beard, murmured in the assembly of conspi-
rators-' He is a traitor-let him die tk~
~leatlr of a traitor.' He imposed on them,
by the reply,
'If within one hour from the moment thai

you hither? Methinks both of us could
have dispensed with this meeting.'
'I imagined sir, '~epiied the major) 'that

therefore, to place my humble fortune at

The Marquis suffered his son to finish
this generous speech, but the flush of indig..
nation which mantled his cheek, and the
uneasy convulsive twitches of his body
showed the difficulty of sitting it out. At
the conclusion of it he sprang to his feet in
a perfect fury, exclaiming passionately,-
'It is the price of the blood of our party
that you dare te offer me, despicable wretch
that you are l No, never will I touch it!
Begone sir, begone!'
Etienne de Labourdilliere stood calmly
under the explosion of paternal wrath and
replied not. After the pause of an instant
the old man apostrophising his grandsons,
thus delivered himself.
'Should any one of you ever accept but
a glass of water from this man, that one
will I disinherit, and on whomsoever of you
who shall except a legacy from him, is my
mak~diction already pronounced.'.
'My Lord Marquis,' remarked Etienne
vith respectful firmness, 'will please to re-
member that Major Seignerohles resides at
Haut Monte!, near Brasseuse. He will there
find him a~ favorably disposed in future, as
at present.'
Then bowing and saying, 'Father I salute
you!' he was leaving the room, but at the
door he halted and turned back.
'Gentlemen yot~r duty is te accompany
me to the stair-case.'
The sons looked at each other, but obey-
ing the magnetic influence of his eyes, they

tuottly yielded obedience, and followed hy
all his sons, Etienne de Labourdilliere
reached the foot of the stairs.
'Gentlemen I thank you,' said the father
as they had gained the castle steps.
The young men bowed their heads, as if
were, in spite of themselves, and each mut-
tered~-Father I salute you! and thus ended
this singular meeting of the long-estrangen
r alatiyes.
CHAPTER IV.
Etienne de Labourdilliere, after this visit u..
Valgenest, returned to the dwelling he inhab-
ited at Ilaut-Montel-under the designation,
Major Seigncrolles, and resumed the almost
solitary life he had led there previously.
His mornings were devoted to field-sports
and evenings to reading. His only domestic
was Catherine Chauvel, the mother of the
little shepherd boy who was instrumental in
leading Pierre Aubin into the snare, as
already described.
The Major and Decadi Robert, having
both served in the Imperial Army, a kind of
acquaintance naturally sprang up between
them. Time and mutual esteem converted
this into actual friendship.
It was after the disbanding of the army of
the Loire that the person known as Major
Seignerolles had come to reside at Ilaut-
Montel, where he had been for about eight
years, when one day he said to the old
soldier-' Father Decadi I need your assis-
tance.'
Greatly surprised was tne worthy fellow at
these words and he looked puzzled.
'Well, will you not grant it?' continued
Etienne.
'You surely must be joking Major-
'you who obtained my pension for me-you,
who lent me two thousand francs to repair
my house and stock my Iitt'e farm, can want
no aid from meunless it be to shoot some
game for you, or execute some commission
at Senhis, in which case I am most completely
at your service.
'You are mistaken, Decadi. It is to
~obtain a place for me!'
'A place is it? In what Diligence then,
you have but to name it.'
'Wrong again; I want a permanent situa.
tion.'
'For yourself?'

It is tiearly the same thing as for myself.
He fer whom I wish to procure it, interests
me nearly as much. I need not say what tie
binds me to him.'
'I do not ask you to do so, Major, but to
whom am I tt make application?'
'To Mademoiselle de Gazeram She has
considerable influence and power in her
Uncle's house and I know that they are
dissatisfied with the present game-keeper.
This is the appointment I should like you to
procure for my p~'otege.'
Pardicul' said the old grenadier, 'you
would have better success yourself, 'if you
would only speak to the lady, for mi~ny times
have both Uncle and Niece said to me,
"Why does not Major Seignerolles come
like a neighbor and visit us? In the country
it is well to see one another, we shall be glad
to receive ~
'I go no where-least of all to the house
of a Gazeran,' replied Etienne in a gloomy
tone.
'That settles the matter. I will speak to
the young lady myself.'
After the silence of a moment, Decadi
Robert hazarded the inquiry,
'Who may the person in the neighbor-
hood be, for whom you want the situation?'
He is not of these parts.'
'Ahs, I see what you'are about. Some old
soldier, like you or I, for whom you kindly
wish to secure a good berth in his age!
Diable! rph)t will make it more difficult to
obtain the situation-for youth is a recoin-
mendation at Gazeran.'
'Then our claimant will suit, for he is but
twenty-three. lIe has returned from Spain:
and wounded too,' said the Major replying to
a contemptuous shrug of Decadi's shoulders,
at the mention of a campaign, which was
generally considered by the people as little
more than a military parade-th'ough in
reality it had its heroes and its victims.'
'Is it possible he has' then seen service
and been in battle. I did not know there had
been any blood shed, but since you say so, I
am convinced such has been the case.'
The result of this conversation was that
Decadi was fortunate enough,' (as he then
considered it,) to interest the Mademoiselle
Gazeran in the stranger for 'whom the desired
situation of game-keeper was promised, and'
thus he announcect his success. 'The place

'Then, my friend, you may have the pleas.'
ure of informing him that he is thus provided
for.'
'Why, where is 'the young man?'
'At yourown hou'sel'
'How soat my house!'
'Yes, indeed, Decadi, he has been there foi~
the last three hours.'
'Then you sent him?'
'Who-I? I never saw him. He know
me not, nor do I, as yet, wish myself to be
known by him.'
'lie must, however, I suppose, know,
that.'
'He knows,' interrupted the Major, 'that
Decadi Robert, to whom his Mother has sent
him, means to get' him some good employ'~
ment, if possible, because, she said, Decadi is
his worthy Uncle.'
The ex-grenadier looked at the Major in
surprise, as his words' were so completely.
enigmatical, and he inquired,-
'Come now, Major, are you in' earnest,~?
What is the 'meaning of this? Am I uncle,
to the young man in question?'
'Yes, without doubt, that you are mos~
assuredly. Was not your Mother married,
(the second time) to the keeper of the con-'
ciergerie qf Paris?'
'True, Sir.'
'Had she not a daughter by that second
union?'
'Yes.'
'And the name of that daughter was
Euphrosine Aubin?'
'It was.'
'Well, she was thy si.
had she riot?'       ster, and had a son,
'I must again reply yes,. lInt the father
no one knows, he must have been some
Noble-an aristocrat I suppose'-.--muttered
the old soldier.
Decadi Robert, however, was not one of
those who carry their respect for family'
honor to that pitch which heaps execrations
on the nearest relatives who may, years ago,
have brought disgrace on the name they'
bear. Nor was it an age or a country,
where and wherisuch things were viewed by
the generality of people, in any station, in the
heinous light that serious christians coil
sistently regard such improper occurrences ~

When Decadi Robert returned home,
Pierre Aubin was there, as the Major had in-
formed him.
The young man had one of those open,
manly countenances which inspire confidence
and affection at first sight. his manners
and conversation ~vere pleasing, and his air
even noble and commanding. In short, he
soon made such a favorable impression on
the old couple and their only Living child, t~ie
pretty Cecile, that in a very few weeks the
future marriage of the young people was a
settled thing.
At the time when Pierre Aubin was am
pointed to the office of protector of the game
in the forests belonging to th~ Gazeran-
family, at the recommendation of Regina de
Gazeran, that lady ~vas in her twehty-seventh,

the full perfection of her great beauty, ttnd

wealth.
'Phis restriction to celibacy had, hitherto,

lion regarding a matrimonial tie. But from
the day on which she first beheld the young
and, handsome Pierre Aubin, a change came
over the haughty dame!
A sudden, violent passion took possession
of her heart; and she did not even seek to
expel or combat it after she had discovered
the nature of her interest in the new game-
keeper. All she attempted' to do, was to
conceal her insensate fancy from the obser-
vation of her doting uncle and the public.
Months passed ere her preference was al-
lowed to be so visible, to the object of it,
that he could attribute the flattering interest
she bestowed on him nu longer to simple be-
nevolence.
Pierre Aubin was, also, preoccupied with
his own tender passion for the pretty and
amiable Ceeile, which caused him td be less
clear-sighted in remarking the love which he
had unintentionally excited. Nevertheless,
he could not always remain ignorant of the
impression he had made on the high-born
beauty. game-keeper trembled at the prospect
of 'the miser~i his prophetic fears foresaw
this love would draw down on his gentle
Cecile and himself. He tried to disbelieve
the evidence of his senses. He gave no ~n-
couragement to her advances, and would not
understand the language of her beautiful,
eyes when they betrayed the intensity of her
admiration of him.
How well guarded was his heart by the
image that reigned in it-that of the modest
loving countenance of his affianced Cecile~
At last came the moment that 'was to try
the power of principle 'and virtuous love 'to
resist the temptation of the syren's delirious~
passion for him. There was no longer a pos-'
sibihity of pretending to mi~nnderstand that
the niece of his lord and master chose to"
overlook the, usually considered insuperable,
difference of birth and station.
Pierre Aubip could not return this love ; '1

tured the experiment, - 'If Miademoiselle
could but know how very dearly I love my
c~9usin Cecile!'
At this announcement, Regina de Gazeran
fell ~ the ground, as though she had been
shot!
Possibly, the seeming swoon that ensued,
mi~ht have been a snare for Pierre Aubin, a
last hope for Regina! She might have
instantly perceived, that at once to kindle
the torch of love in his pre-occupied heart,
was out of the question; but that pity once
excited, love might succeed.
Frightened, beyond measure, the faithful,
betrothed lover of Cecile bent over the noble
lady, and regretted having spoken out so
bluntly; and he eagerly tried to restore\ her
to consciousness.
It is perfectly true, that Pierre was vehe-
mently in love with his affianced' one, and
prided himself on remaining constant find
true to her; nevertheless, it was not in his
power to help feeling admiration, in gazing
at the beautiful woman before him.
Must we confess it? Candor compels the
avowal, that, in the secret recesses of his
soul, Pierre's vanity began, to be agreeably
flattered at the persuasion, that he, the game-
keeper, had actually smitten the heart of the
beauteous, accomplished, -and much-sought
heiress, to such a degree that she was dying
of love for him!
If this were a weakness, at his age, it was
but natural.
'Oh, ho~v magnificently beautiful she is!'
he involuntarily e~tclaimed aloud, as, with
palpitating heart and feverish delight, he
looked on her reviving color. 'No, I must
not, cannot love thee !-yet how shall I ever
be able to forget thee?'
As these words were-pronounced, Regina
slowly opened her now languishing eyes.
The surprise affected by the lady on find-
ing herself supported by Pierre Aubin, was
expressed so well, so naturally, that he began
to fancy he was somewhat astray in his con-
jectures, and that his vanity had deceived
him when he attributed her fainting to his
confession of love for Cecile.
Regina had recovered her sense of dignity
and decorum, and, withdrawing from hi~ re-
spectful support, she said,-
'Pierre I thank you for your attention.
No doubt it would have been desirable that
on s~uch air occasion of1 ilbiess, Louise ray

own maid, or Cecile your cousin, had been
in the way to render assistance, however, it
could not be foreseen-and in future should
such a faintness come over me whilst in your
presence, I' have to request, beforehand, that
you do at once hasten to the nearest habita-
tion and bring the first peasant girl you meet.
Any woman understands what to do, under
such circumstances, infinitely better than a
This was sai4 in a tone that might well be
mistaken for the coldest indifference, mmd
she also continued in a similar vein, as if the
thought had just occurred to her mind.
'I do not nsl~ you to keep my sudden faint-
ing-fit, a secret. It is known that I am sub-
ject to this unpleasant occurrence, besides
were you to endeavor to preserve silence on
the. subject, your manner might be embar-
rassed, and carry an appearance of there
being a secret between you mind ~- whilst
between Pierre Aubin, the game-keeper, and
the lady of Gazeran Castle, there can be
no such thing.'
Regina made this speech in the haughtiest
manner conceivabk~, and in strange contrast
with her previous t~ondescention, then with
a patronising, rather than obliged manner,
once more expressing her thanks, she walked
homewards.
At the last words and parting looks of the
lady, the whole brilliant fabric, that had been
erected by vanity on th~ supposition of her
love for him, fell to the ground, and Pierre
remained 'stupefied with amazement, he was
vexed at himself for having ever supposed it
possible.
Shouldering his gun, which he had propp-.
ed against a tree, when he flew to raise the
lady from tho 'cold grass, he exclaimed
mentally as he walked away in a disconsolate
mood.-
'I was a presumptuous fool-an ass! She
cares not for, me after alL l3ctter though,
that it is so.' Nevertheless he said to hint-
self' once more-' How very beautiful she
is I'
Althoug'h Mademoiselle had permitted him
to sp~ak of the meeting in the wood, and
what had passed there, Pierre Aubin did not
~neflti9n it to~ any one.,. He would even
glady have forgotten that in Regina's pres~
ence dazzled by her attractiptls he had twice
beesi obliged to invoke thoughts of Cecile to
pr~veiit his eyes misleading his heart.

More perhaps to obliterate such ideas than
as the result of his love to Cecile, on the
evening of that day. Pierre redoubled his
attentions to her. The innocent confiding
girl, rejoiced visibly at this more than usual
display of feeling, and her affection made him
experience remorse for his fleeting admira-
tion of Regina, as though he had really been
faithless in heart.
Not long did this cloud overcast the peace-
ful vision of the game-keeper's love which
reverted wholly to his Cecile, the true mag-
net.
As for Regina, she now avoided, as much
as heretofore she had sought, meeting Pierre,
and when accident brought him into her
presence, her dignified look~ and distant
manner confirmed the impression, that he
must have been mistaken in the supposed
nature of her sentiments towards hii~m.
Thc part which the lady was acting, how-
ever, was not sustained without considerable
effort. ~Many times had she, when alone,
felt indignant to think that, with her be
and rank, her first look had not brought to
her feet. the man ~vhom she, so elevated, had
deigned to honor, with a preference! Car-
ried away by a passion, which the indiffer-
ence of Pierre heightened instead of extin-
guished, she was almost tempted to cast
aside disguise and let her words express the
feelings of heart, saying, ' Oh, love me as I
love you!'
Such an entreaty, as from the lips of her
~migh-born suitors, she hud received with dis-
dam, but which she would have' hailed with
delight from the humble game-keeper.
However, for a time, she managed- to tri-
umnph over these wild impulses, but, in
secret, she shed tears of rage and shame as
she thought of Cecile, her innocent and
unconscious rival.
'Oh, to think that I should not be able to
supplant her, ~nd yet be unwilling to relin-
quish the hope of prevailing over the con-
stanef of Pierre Aubin!'
Thus spoke the proud beauty to her
omost self, and the exclamation which had
escaped from the man whom she fondly
luv~d, 'Oh, how magnificently beautiful she
is!' sounUed in her ears and kept alive her
hopes of ultimate success.
Regina had 'flattered herself that Pierre
would have felt the loss of favor, and been
anxious for a renewal of her previously gra-

cious and attractive manner. But her co- I
quettish hauteur had failed in its object, and J
she saw that she must change her plan of'
attack, make a compromise with her prid~
and dignity, and advance to meet the hear
reluctant to respond to her own. In accord-
ance with this resolution she contrived to
get Cecile to the castle under the pretence
of wishing her to execute some delicate em-
broidery.
On her return the pretty rustic spoke of
her delightful visit in terms nf rapture, and
the flattering distinction bestowed on her by
the Lady Gazeran, was hailed with pride and
pleasure by the parents of Cecile.
Pierre Aubin, alone, was dissatisfied and
unrejoiced, he felt that son~e fresh snare was
concealed, by this sudden advance, and that
it boded another struggle for which he had
no desire. He had come off victorious once,
but he feared to renew the risk. He had,
therefore, declined going to the castle to ree
his betrothed safe home, as had been ar-
ranged by the condescending mistress of the
Lordly HaIls, ai~d well did he kuow how to
interpret, the circumstance, that the charm -__
ing lady, Regina, had suddenly been taken
with a fainting fit when it was announced
that Decadi Robert had come (instead of
Pierre Aubirt) to escort his daughter back
from the castle.
It was, indeed, a blow alike to the love
and the pride of the infatuated Regina, for
she did not deceive herself as to the motive
that kept Pierre away.~ It was not his duty,
as game-keeper, that could cause him to
substitute Decadi for himself on such occa-
sion. What coutd it be but to avoid meet-
ing her? Thus was she foiled1 and unable
to put in practise the acts by which she had
fully intended to set herself off to advantage
by contrast with Cecile, who, guileless and
and totally devoid of suspicion, was filled
with gratitude for the l~indnss and attention
which had been shown her, and she expa-
tiated to her cousin Pierre on~ the beauty,
talents, and gracefulness of Regina Gaze-
ran.
In vain did the young man strive to turn.
the conversation. Cecile was so touched
with the kindness lavished on her by the
great lady that, (as Regina had calculated)
she could speak to her lover of nothing else,.
and her praise and admiration were couched
in the language of youthful enthusiasm.

Once, during the dangerous commenda-
tions of her new friend, Pierre Aubin man-
aged to silence his fair cousin completely,
hy saying to her,-
'It seems to me, Cecile, that 1 love you
less the more you discourse about your visit
to ~iazeran.'~
Cecile did not inquire of her lover how
her enthusiastic praise of the lady who had
received her so kindly, was displeasing to
him-but, loving so warmly, so tenderly, she
would scrupulously avoid mention of the
name Regina de Gazeran.
it has been remarked, that the noble
dame of the castle waited but an opportunity
to renew the perilous attack, on the game-
keeper, which she discovered (with woman's
keen perception) that he feared to encoun-
ter.
Much time did not elapse ere an event
occurred which was favorable to the wishes
of the enchanting temptress.
Philiberte Robert, the mother of Cecile,
was attacked with a grievous sickness, in
fact, of such a nature, that her life was
despaired of. This served as a pretext of
which Regina eagerly availed herself, to
make a show of interest in the peasant girl,
by daily visiting the sick' mother, and thus
she secured a daily meeting with Pierre
Aubin.
Death speedily seized his destined prey.
With kindest protestations, and every ap-
pearance of sincere affection towards Cecile,
Mademoiselle de Gazeran insisted on remov-
ing her from 'the house of mourning to the
castle, whither she and her father, Decadi
Roberts, took up quarters for about a month.
The repugnance which Pierre felt at the
ideii of visiting the abode of the Syren, wa~
overcome by consideration of the afflictior
of his beloved Cecile, who could best~ b(
consoled by the sympathy and kindness o
his sincere regard and affection. Tbns, lov(
and' duty combined to lead him where h
was obliged to meet the redoubtable Regina
Between the mistress of the lordly halL
and ~hcr dependent, the game-keeper,
strange species of contest ensued dunn!
this period.
Deeply enamored of the handsome youn~
man, and completely infatuated, Regin
gave the strongest and most visible evidence
of the state of her feelings. The warmt]
of her manner was habitually met with th

icy coldness of respect; but the steady con
centration of the sun's rays will dissolve the
stubborn chillness of the frozen mass. Des-
pite, therefore, of good resolves and virtuous
intention, backed even by sincere love for
another,-the. respect was, on one solitary
occasion, obliterated.
When Cecile, on the succeeding day,
received the customary attentions from these~
two persons, she little suspected that the one
was suffering the pangs of shame and re-
morse, and that the other had added a fresh
stain to her tarnished conscience.
For six months, from that time, Pierre
Aubin contrived to avoid meeting Regina
alone, and the pure love which he bore
for the innocent Cecile had hut . increased,
if possible, by the, contrast of hei purity and
virtue, which he would feign emulate.
At last he found himself one day face to
face with his evil genius, ~vho thus addressed
him,-
'Pierre, I can, I will become free. Mv
uncle, the Lord 6f Gazeran, is about to make
a jous'ney to Italy for, the benefit, of his
health, atid he proposes to take me with him.
His fortuneshould devolve upon me,-J)ut I
am willing to renounce it-to break my pro-
mise of celibacy. You know that I love
you. I will no longer admit the control of
an~~ person (save you) over my action.
Will you marry me?'
He regarded the determined and impas-
sioned beauty with a mournful look of
astonishment.
'Will you mary me?' she repeated, ad-
ding-
'I will brave public opinion and reproach.
I will sacrifice every thing for the man I so
warmly love-but if my position should be-
come too irksome we xviii depart hence.
You are silent l Well, I give you two days
E to consider what I hqve said. Mind that I
receive your answer before the expiration of

'You shall have it to-morrow,' replied
s Pierre.
~   The next day was Sunday, and the curate
~ of the parish of Brasseuse, (according to
the custom of the country) announced from
~ the pulpit-the betrothal of Pierre Aubin

pi~h the violence of his secret 1~ve for Regina;
and whilst his brothers, regardless of him,
entered into the compact to secure the prtze~
he cherished the wish he dared not hope to
see. realized, and experienced the miserable
feeling arising from consciousness of per-
sonal deformity, a~d consequent inferiority,
which in his breast engendered self-hatred
and rancorous envy and malice towards all
those who were open to love, with hopes of
success , and he swore vengeance, sure and
secret, on ~zny, favored rival.
For months, had the coquettish Regina,
who delighted in the homage of all m~n, en-
couraged, by turns, each of the four brothers,
without giving any decided preference to
either.
During this period of uncertainty, Antoine
s~zffered the pangs of jealousy from her ca-
pdcious indecision. Unsuspected and Un-
~jtied, he endured the bitter feelings of hatred,
mortification, and eniiy. He could norbrook
L.~,idea of a favored one;. he shuddered at
the thought; yet, at the expiration of mouths
of vacillation, when all the brothers seemed
likely to be rejected, by the lady of his secret
love, Antoine was dissatisfied. The slight.to
them he resolved to treasure up, to be re-
venged upon whoever should happen to be
preferred to them.
The compact antI the courtship here spoken
cf, it will be understood, had taken place be-
f~re the visit, to Haut'Montel, of the brothers,
whom we had just ushered into the, presence
of their u~williugly-acknowledged father.
The haughty and rebellious young men
had come at the summons of the Major, but
were ignorant or his motive in sending for
them. They dared not refuse to attend, yet
w~s 'their salutation disresjeetful and scorn-
M; and their manner plainly showed a pre-
determination to make no concessions to their
rejected parent.
,~reat was the astonishment of Pierre, the
bid~.ien witness, pn hearing the Major address
these young noblemen as their father, and
~ft'er t9rehnquish his claims to the, property
of. tl~e old .I~~Iarquis (deceased) in thei~,14vor
to allow them to enter into possession of th
Labourdilliere inheritance., as though be, iht
~p~aker, had ,i~i reality passed away f~9In. ex
istence, as was generally supposed.
~tiedne. de, Laboprdilliere also xpressec
his willingness to retain his present incognito

leaving to. his Sons their political opinions uti-
questioned and unfettered. To do all this he
promised, in return for their simply granting
him the satisfaction of passing the residue of
life in the society of his sons. Also, to let
the past be obliterated from recollection, and
the future be spent in such amicable terms
as became their relationship.
With gloomy brows, and t~tern, unmoved
countenances, had the four young men lis-
tened to the advances so nobly made to them.
The dwarf, however, had manifested a dis-
respectful irritation, which was checked
several times by his elder brother. He now
insolently and ironically put the query that
the Qthers hesitated to speak,-
'Are these your only demands for resign-
ing your rights? ~s this, then, all you have
to say to us?'
'No; it is not all!' was the quiet reply.,
'Ah! Ab!' 'exclaimed the sons,, simulta-
neously, each hoping that some inadmissible
proposition would give a color of justification
to themselves for the refusal on which they
were deterrninnd.
'Out of ~the fortune I propose giving up to
you,' continued the kind old man,. 'I wish
you to set apart any sum you may see fit, as
an allowance, in token of your favor and as
an evidence of good will towards the indi-
vidual, for whom I would besp~ik it. No
matter how small the amount you may de-
vote to this purpose, that~ is of little impor-
tance in my sight: it is, the principle on
which you act. My earnest desire is to se-
cure for him your regard, your friendship.'
~ Who is the person in question?' inquired
William.
'Your brother!'
'How so? Who? What brother?' burst
from them, in accepts of a4onishment,,
'If lie of whom I speak has not borne my
rt~me since the death of your mother, it was,
my children, out of consideration to you;
but if I have thus deprived 'him of the title
of son, so much the more am J bound to se-
I cure him an honorable position; an'd,, what is
still better, and dearest to my heart, your
united friendship. Truly, I assure you, he is
worthy of it.'
Again Antoine was spokesman, rudely
saying,-
'Does the Major believe that friendship or
I affection is to be commanded?, and ~ilI he
inform us who i~ the individual whom he

In spite of the efforts' of Etienne de La-
bourdilliere to restrain himself in presence of
his7insulting sons, he mechanically raised his
hand in a threatening manner, as the .young
man finishedd this aggravating speech.
The brothers instantly assumed a hostile
attitude, and, with united voices, exclaimed:
* 'Beware, sir! We will repel violence.'
Atthefi~~t movement of his aristocratic
brethren,'Pierre~as about'to rush from his

the Major spoke:

'extend indulgence towards you. It is the

remarked:'
'You will be none the less a stranger. Ai

The Major, though~ deeply~ wounded anc
sorely grieved, didn't -reply to 'thfs addition

given?
'The five brothers, with formal bows am

The afflicted parent, no longer obliged ti
restrain his feelings, sank on a chair, cover'
his face with 'his hands, and murmured, in th~
accents of 'bitter irnd touching reproach,-

Stretching our his hand to' Pierre, the
Major kindly said:
'My son, I see in you one who is to con-
sole me for the sorrow which the. others Jiave
caused me.'
Pierre clasped it energetically, pressed it to
his lips, and exclaiming, 'Father! father!'
sank on his knees before him.
The Major raised the son of his loved
Enphrosine, and bidding him sit beside him
-as soon as they had regained composure to
speak-~.thus addressed him
'Had I foreseen this result, I should not
have made you a witness of this scene. I
expected some remonstrances, but I calculat-
ed on ultimate success. I had, it seems, too
good an opinion of the pupils of my *ife and
the Marquis, my father,'
'I hope that you will not seek another in-
terview, my dear sir. It is so distressing.'
'I will not promise that.'
'At least, I beseech you not again to so-
licit them for friendship towards me. Am I
not well enough provided in possessing
yours?'
'Yes, Pierre, you deserve alone to possess
all my love; but shall I avow it? In spite of
myself I feel affection for those who ungrate-
fully spurn me from their hearts. Alas l we
do not with impunity descend from a noble
race, or cherish the pride of birth, without
I cost. Regard for the name one bears, will
force one to overlook and forgive the injuries
of thos~whom we would not have disgraced.'
'It is not for me, sir, to reproach you for
this leaning towards those of ~rour own blood,'
replied Pierre. DoI not see in it a guaranty

'No doubt,' replied the Major, pressing
c, his hand.
'No doubt, but listen to me. These five

of satisfaction, 'that you will never forget-

'Oh, my son, thou art the only one whc

'Add to that-and for my brothers,' so.

As Pierre approached the door for this

the adieu of her betrothed.
'Apleasant 'journey to you, Pierre,' said
she, 'then closed the door so quickly that, to

~ Ah, ~he 'gipsey. She has not been to

Full of joyful~ anticipations for the future,
the'~game-keeper set out for Paris.
- The Major dismissed' his sole attendant,
't'he"old 'house-keeper, who was the mother
of Petit Ghauvil-and was busy all that
~diIy (dii which Piar*e was journeying to th9
'Metropolis) 'preparing to quit Haut-Montel.
When evening came he set out to~inake one
'inorey experiment oil the feelings ~ his
qons.'

it was supper-time at the castle of Valga-
*st, and the five grandsons of the. dec~sed
'Marquis were seated around a sumptuous
'table, when the bell of the great gate re
sounded through the halls. Bartholomew,
the old servitor, already mentioned as so
'unscrupulonsly devoted to the family honor
it was, who opened to the unusually lat"
summons. 'He was so surprised at sight
of the visitor that he hesitated, in confusion,
whether to aimit him or not.
Taking advantage of thi's perplexity, th~e
Major brushed hastily past the porter, crossed
the court called the Court of honor, rapidly
ascended the stairs and entered the dining
hall unannouncedd.
On beholding their father, the assembled
children shuddered, and simultaneously arose
-but not, alas! out of respect.
'For what purpose came you here, sir!'
inquire l Antoine.
'1 come to dWell amicably with you, my
sons,' calmly replied Etienne de 'Labourdil-

'Make room for me at this table where I
have a right to sit, and be pleased to resume
~your 'places, gentlemen. I wish rite family
to be complete, and henceforth it will be so
since I, its chief, 'am added to you all.'
To this the' eldest son replied :-~~
'Take the place wftich belongs to you,

Command at Valgenest. It is your right.
We shall respect your rights. But you. can-
not force us to live under the same root
with you.. The day on which you enter
here is the day on which we feave.'
The five brothers then threw their nap~
kins on the table, took their hats, and silently
walked out of the dining-hall.
The Major was' not prepared for this sud-
den revolution; he was disturbed, agitated,
'and for some time.knew not what to do.
- We will now revert to 'the game.keepei'.
When Pierre Aubin, on~ hi~ return from

Chauvel the departure of the Major from

The question, uow will probably arise.
Where~ during this time, was Major 'Seigne-
wiles? He was a prisoner in the castle of
Vaiganest
the    CHAPThR     VI.
castle of Valganest the Major
p~~sed many niotiths, in conformity with a
eoiupact he had made with his disdainful
seas. Unwilling to resign the casfle.'home,
fheir rank and tbrtune, by really carrying
out4he, scornful resolve they had expressed
on quitting the supper-table, they had suffered
themselves to be induced to remain.-pro-
vided that their father would agree to con-
ceal himself,' and not let it be known that he
was alive and a resideizt beneath his own
t'eof.
Not as a.master or guest did Etienne de
Labourdilliere take up his abode at Valga-
nest, his lawful inheritance-but as a self-
immured'prisoner!
* To ~these - strange conditions the Major
consented, in .the hope of ultimately obtain-
ing~a~ portion of the affection of hjs. sons.
Fancying that his captivity was a laudable
uwetl as voluntary ~acriflce to them, he
'was satisfied'with being thus tolerated. The
~nly thing that the old man c~rtld not bear
patiently was, being compelled to forego all
Iw~erconrse with Pierre, Decadi, etc.~ at
-Brasseuse,' and as latterly happened) being
~4ebarred all knowledge of their welfare.
This yearning towards his only affection-
ate child became more intense, ~nd, after a
time, almost unbearable, as from a lofty tur-
Tht~ which overlooked t~e surrounding coun-
try for miles; 'he witnessed, wlth pain and
~a4asm, the frequent ineendiary~fire5 which,
lat this~ period, devastated the land,-spr~ading
terror, ruin, and digtruction, far nd n~r.

who might be depended on as unwilling to
connive at the Major's' escape, should he be
'weary of his solitude and long again to mix
in the worl4-or simply sigh to regain free-
dom.
Now on this side, and then on the other,
would the frequently occurring and appalling
ccapflagrations arise. The merciless flames
spared neither rich or poor, levelling all dis-
tinctions, as, in turn the miserable hovel of
the peasant, or the stately baronical halt,
was marked by an unseen hand, for destruc-
tion.
Isolated and far apart as were most of
these' habitations, mysteriously doomed' to
be consumed without ii~krning, and in the
lead df the night-many of the confl~igra-
lions were attended with an awful loss of
life, and the victims were born to their last
resting place amid large concourse of the
panic-stricken inhabitants of the district,
who quailed at the thought-' Who will be
the next to suffer ?'
As these melancholy funeral processions
passed within sight, the lonely watcher on
the tower would kneel down and pray that
the inhabitants of the game-keeper of Bras-
seuse might be spared!
It becam~ noted that the dread visitation
vvl~ich had in more or less degree, afThcted
all else, within many leagues, had but one
total exception. This being the Castle of
Val~anest, whose occupants, the five bro-
thers, were far from being.. in good qdor
with theIr neighbors-all manner of sur-
mises and ill-natured remarks were, in con~
sequence, freely circulated.
This rather remarkable exemption was
about to cease in an appalling manner-bnt,
meanwhile, an incident of equally awful
airport( claims our attention.
'Late in the still night, as the Major was
quietly pacing his lQnely round,.on the tur-
ret, (his vigdanr eye caught sight' of' the
terror-boding ~mnoke ascending high o'er the
~wood of Brasseuse. 'His alarm was intense;
and thus hespoke his thoughts aloud.
'My worst fears are realized! lzlis turn
has, ~rt1iesgth, come! Oh I Pierre, my son!
Would that-I could aid or save you! And
ye ruthless 9nes-ye will give me no intelli-
gence of his fate. Ye accord' me not your
'love,'a9d but rarely your society even, and
for this have I relinquished kim and all that
man holds dear !~

Bitter must have been the reflections t
that solitary being at the time of' the
~posed peril to Pierre Aubin.
It was, however, the neighboring house
and barns of La Grange farm which wer
then burning, though he knew it not; fo
that time the game-keeper's dwelling wa
safe-Yet i was not spared from motivO
of' mercy, but in furtherance of a plot in
evolving the destruction of Pierre's' gooi
name, he being missing-unaccountably t4
his neighbors,-thongh the reader is awar4
that he was the occupant of a dungeon
whither his abductors had conveyed him
from the scene of festivity which was inter
rupred by the .treaeherous scxeech-owl sig
nal.
To return to the Major.-He could bea'
the' torturing uncertainty no longer. At a!
hazards to himself he m'.ist inquire the fat
of his son, Pierre. From his pocket-boot
he tears a leaf, writes a few 'lines on it,' re
questing, the finder, whoelrer he 'may be,-
if Pierre Aubin be living, to pass down th(
avenue in front of the castle, and cut
branch from a sapling on the rigkt lnanc

ped around two 'pieces of gold, ~mnd tyin~
them' in the cornerof his handkerchief,'hi
twirled thi9 with the motion of a sling, and
thus launched the'missive in the air.
Away flew the cloth and its enclosure
beyond the bounds of the imprisoning
walls.
Alas, for Etienne do LabourdilIier~, these
articles were picked up, the next morning,
by Bartholomew, who handed them to his
young lords.
In a body these~ five men repaired to' the
turret, where the despised parent was on the
look-out for some one 'tO come along and
make known whether anything'f'atal had hap-
pened to Pierre- 'i'hey upbraided thefl"pri-
sorter' for this infringement of his contract,
feigning to believe he had some ded~er, mo-
tive than appeared, and was ~desiroiis of
compromising them and freeing himself.
This the o14 man denied, and he besought
them to give him the satisfaction of know-
ing the result of the last fire, and the tide of
Pierre. This~ they, inhumanly, would not
do, but left their father in' an ag~n~r of sus-
pense.
After this interview~ a' consultation w~s

held between the brothers, as to what c~u~i~
they should pursue. '
'Oar common ir~terest~ requires that ~t~M
's should not oecutr again,' said F'raneois,'th&amp;

~ F'rancois, who thus" spoke, was, front his
superior, mental, and personal qualifieati'oi~s,
- the ruling head of the house of LabourJi~-

'Undoubtedly, you are i'ight!' bo1di~
replied the dwarf, Antoine.

I in a decided tone,~-'-- "
'Let it be done. I take it-upon mys~1f."'
'lie .it so!' re~ilied the rest.
The dwarf then dragged a large 'cakeil

and amongst them they carried it up stairs-.

thus spoken, F~rancois rushed
~~ving
~~tily up statra. The Major had r~ot come
- ~Iowji from the turret at the moment wheft
nte~ded parricide set his foot on the
first step of the spiral stair-ease.
,~You will be too late-he is coming
do~n,' exclaimed the dwarf.
'' ~q, I shall not. I can reach the room
be~orehe will V i'eplied the ~vre~ch, and he
~i~ppcared in the darkness.
The brothers, below, listened intently.ro
tli~, ~teps ~f these two men approaching,
opposite qitarters, the appointed place
ofthe death which one was carrying to the
other.
It was a. moment of interest and excite-
w~z4~ fraught with crime l
'Francois has reached the room, and the
9t.I~1er is not yet down. He will have time to
conceal himself behind the arras,' said Wil-
Iti~
Now the Major is at the door-he 'is open-
ing it-he is in the room-he has locked
the door-now coine&amp; - the moment of con-
flint.
Eonore could say no more;, WillianT and
Jarne9 trembled and turned pale..
One, only, of the brothers retained his
ferQeious spirit unrtdngled with pity or re-
morse. This was Antoine, the fiendish
~4wj~rf. He-fearing lest the others~ might
relent, should they hear their fathers voice
entreating help-took down ~ hunting horn
t~pm the wall, and blew a blast so long, so
loud, and fearful, that it soumled, under t~ie
4~rea~l excitement of the moment, like some
u4earthly demon-yell.
A pause in the horrid din, and a scuffle
was heard overhead-~-then a shriek-and, all
wa~ silent as the grava l
Presently a whistle was heard on the
stairs, The twins arose~ but could l~ardly
stagger along. Antoine and, the remaining
brother were firm, ajid. together. tlio four
~i~p~ted the stair~ and entered the upper
ro~x~. There they found Fran~co~s atone,
feeding g and ghastly pale. '
'It is over I'. said hepointing the chest
whioh st~od in the corner V He is dead l
He is in it!'
Net without horror could the guilty men
Mi~ on ,tlie~ fatal ~wst.' A lon~, ~treum ~f
blood stained the floor, and Willi~u~, touch-

ing his brpther~s arm, inquired-' Are you
not wous~ded ~
'Yes, in the struggle he turned the poig-
nard on me-but it is only a trifling scratch.
Nothing now is to be don&amp;-.save to burn
myclothes, andwash away the stains from
the boards. All then is safe!'
'Dat what are we to do with~ that-that
chest V asked ~Honore, with? averted gaze,
pointing to it.
'Never mind, I will see to it,' 'replied
Francois; 'I will dispose of' that myself.'
From this fearful scene we must revert
again to Regina. When, pressed by the
brothers to select one of them as her future
husband, she had told them"that she would
be the wife of no man until she had been
avenged on Pierre Aubin, whom, she alleged,
had insulted her with his base love.
This they readily undertook to do, and we
have seen how they got him in their power,
and conveyed him (as hey thought) to a
living tomb in the vaults ~ Gazeran castle.
Glad were they to find it was C man whom
they previously hated, that ~va~ o he the
victim of' this wori~ijm's revenge.
Besieged, by suitors, and loving only
Pierre, Re~iha, to be rid of importunity,
agreed,' e e long, to become the wife of
Francois de Labourdilliere. The brothers
being satisfied that the coveted property of
Gazeran' would thus come into the family,
the three unsuccessfi~tl wooers withdrew their
pretensions with a good grace, and renewed
their vow-that their paterna~.feeIings should
remain undisturbed by this preference.
Antoine, alone, was free to act. He had
not entered the lists as competitor for the
lady's favor, therefore he took no part in the
renewal of the brother's compact. Yet, he
was resolved, if possible, t  prevent 'the
nrntch, which, however, it will shortly ap..
pea'~, was fearfully obstructed.
It was a festival at Yalganest, a grand en-
telileOt given to celebrate the bet'ro~haI
of Fraf1co1s~ and Regina. All the aristocracy
of the neighlio'rhood was assembled and

~O1' the party, he, Francdis, the most guilty,
seemed unconcerned. flis head was eree*,
a ready smile played on his lip~, and his
heart seemed at ease.
We will pass over the ball and supper
without description, to narrate the startling
event that shortly after occurred to disturb
the, scene of joyous festivity.
Suddenly arose the alarming cry of fire!
High above the gay music of the baud
sounded the words-fire! fire! On the
instant of alarm, as the guests hurried to the
windows, was to be seen, the ancient pavi-
lion, at the end of the path, glowing in a
brilliant blaze-the flames already bursting
through the roof.
'Cahn yourselves, ladies and gen~tleinen,
,there is nothing to be feared! Let it burn!
said Antoine; 'It is only a miserable stru&amp;-
tare which the fire will save us the trouble
of pulling down. It only wanted"a bo~n-ffrr~
to complete the rejoicing, and the incendi-
aries have taken on themselves this addition
to surprise us.'
l~he panic of the company ceased on
this remark, the brothers inwardry applauded
the presence of mind of the dwarf, and they
also said-' Let it burns'
The sight of the burning pavilion dis-
pelled the gloom that oppressed some of the
sons of the Major, and a weight was instantly
removed from' their guilty' minds. They
blessed the hand from whence the kindling
spark proceeded-for within that blazing
pile lay the coffin-chest, which how they
thought wouki be effectually disposed of-
'But the alarm had spread amongst the ser-
vants~ and Vetainers of the' gitests. The
cOmmands of the lordly brothers, to let' the
building be consumed, had notreached their'
ears, and in a body they had ,gone to endea-
vor to1 put out the tIre.
The great bell of-the castle was loudly
tolling, and in aC incredibly short time
people rushed f:rom all quarters to thd ooi..

Those who 'had first arrived at the

The confusion incident to the oceiision ma~
it a difficult job to save th~ odd med1~y t$f
articles here stored away; and, in truilithe
old-fashioned lumber and family ~urio~iti~s-
did not ~seem worth the risk, to life' aft~1
,limb, of the busy hard-working crowd.
The pavilion was totally' ruveloped in
flames when the owners arrived, but '~li~r
rushed into it as precipitately as if it con-
tained something veryt precioCs wh~cli ~
were anxious to save. As they reached Abe
interior, two stout foot-men were~ trying ~
~oroe open the lid of a large chest, ap~it-
rently too heavy for them to carry out, in
or'ler to get at the opposeded valuable con-
tents.
'Leave it, I command you%' cried Wiltiajit
in a thundering tone, and he repulsed'tii~

condolence.

to the death of the murderous incendiaries.
It sometimes happened, though, tfrat these
barbarous c~rousals were interrupted by the
tocaln's sound, or the sudden blaze of a new
coz4lagration.
The most favored of the victims, of the
unknown band of depredators, suffered only
~n their possessions-their stocks of hay or
corn,1 their barns or out-houses, being destroy-
ed by the fiery scourge. But if these disas-
ters were less fatal, they were numerous, and
seryed to keep up the general and continued
terrorr and alarm.
As the place of a murder i~ marked (in
I~OmaII catholic countries) by a cross,~o per-
petuate the remembrance of' the deed, and
suggest pious reflections and prayers,, on the
spot where it ot~curred-so was it resolved,
Lllat a monumental tomb to the unfortunate
~'rancoie' should be erected over the place
where he perished,
Accordingly the ruins of the pavilion were
clearedd away, and a nei~ hunial..vault con-
on its site, under' th9 intmedi~te
~st4tetvisi6n of ~he brothers:
"During'thistiine they took i$ by turns to
watch (with'ihe relay of priests) beside' the
coffined-remains of kim whom they knew as
the ill-fatedp ,!ieid4'V.vbo had been struck,

in, presence of 1his victim,, just as they dread-,
ed exposure of the awful crime to which
they, hardly less guilty than the deceased,
had constructeil, and actually connived at.
For two days had the body thus lain in
well-guarded 'state; and the e~remplary per-
formance of this fraternal duty with the ap-
pearance of affliction and tender solicitude
which the aristocrats displayed -(though in
reality Antoine was callous to all good feeling)
contributed not a little' raise the ill-liked
fraternity in public estimation.
It had not been credited that they were
capable ef real attachment even to each
other.
The great entrance to Valganest was open
to all comers: 'for any one was free, for the
time, tO enter there withoutt ceremony. Su
it happened that no notice was taken of a
certain person, who came for a veyy different
purpose than to evince respect fhr the dead.
This person was evidently a stranger to
the castle: for he had no little difficulty in
making out the way to the chamber which
he sought. However, he seemed at length
to have found the right place, for he halted
at a door, on which he knocked, in a very pee.
culiar manner, three several times.
Antoine, the occupant of the' room, had
just been released from watch over the re-
~mains of his brother, and had disposed him..
self for sleep, when his acute earuetected the
raps which were 'so ,timidly or cautiously
made. He raised his head, rubbed his eyes,
looked wildly around, and in'uttered,-
'It caujiot be possible!'
The man who stood in the corridor, listen-
ing attentively for some sound within the
room, having heard the slight noise made by
Antoine, repeated not the rapping, but
scratched four~ separate times (with a mea-
sured pause between each) on a panel of the
door.
'It must be so! It is one of them!' ex-
claimed the dwarf, half aloud; and greatly
an~~yed, it' lint also, alarmed, jie hastily quit-
ted the bed on which he had flnng himself for
a brief repose, ,a~td opened the door.
The stranger who met his view was a man
of imposing height. and fine proportions. He
was dressed in the long blue surtout, with
black collars that denojad the half-pay officer
of that Feriod. A smallpiece of red~ribbon
'decorated a button-hole of his coat; he wa~
booted, spurred,'~and traVel-stained.

Antoine most probably expected to hat
seen some one else, for he appeared ove:
come with astonishment; and not until di
new-coiner had closed the door and seate
himself, did he recover the power of &amp;peecl
Then mastering his agitation, he hurriadl
and imperatively put these questions to ih
unknown
'Who are you?' Whence cameyou?-

With a' waive of the hand, expressive c
the necessity for composure, the strange
whispered his interrogative reply,-
'Can we converse here safely 'P
'Converse, say you? First have the good
ness to tell me who you are, and from whon
you come?' replied Antoine.
'I come on my ewn account. As . to whi
I am, ypu shall presently be informed o
that.' \,
Thus speaking, the strange intruder, open
ing a memorandum-book, took out of it
*&amp; playing-card-it was the ace of spades-pre
sending it to Antoine, he inquired,-
'Do you know that, Mr. Mathien?'
This name, which we have used for thc
first time, to the unworthy hprig of a noblc
t~ree, did not appear to cause any surprise tC
the person thus addressed. He glanced al
the card, and an expression of ~mistrust writ
legible on his ill-favored features.
As if to remove all doubt and suspicion,
the handsome, visitor held up the card be-
tween him and the light. Immediately it be-
came plain that'the figure on the card was
perforated 'by pin-holes, at the angles, the
rays of light penetrating through the minute
orifices, rendering ~these marks visible.
'Now, then, perhaps Mr. Mathien can
guess who I am!' coolly remarks the un-
welcome guest.
'You are one sent to me to settle some old
accounts. Tell me the figures and I will set
them down,' cunning replied the dwarf,,thus
pointing out tFie part.for the stranger to act
in case any one should disturb their inter-'
view.
'Very well; that will explain, without
risk, that which ought not to be 'overheard
by any 'listener at the door, 'if such should be
there.'
Antoine then took paper iind pens from. a.

dictation, until the whqle sjde, of a ~sheet
was filled with these symbolical cyphers;

The house of Pierre Aubin, Which, on.
the occasion of the baptism of Philiberte,
was so resplendent with light, and so full of
jojt~ussound, was silent' and dismal as the
grave. One little lamp ajone sent its feeble

rocked it, with a sorry smile, as if the object

quil sleep!
This 'idiotic woman was the once gay,
intelligent and lovely Cecile!'. This sad
wreck was the work of that fearful disap-
pearance of her husband, Pierre Aubin,
related in the first chapter of our tale.
Poor Cecile had not been in her senses
since that memorable fete. Philiberte, the
,little babe, was. sent to nurse, and during the
day the mother of the unconscious innocent
would pass her time with it at the nurse's
cottage, but every evening at nightfall she
would return home'to see if Pietre had come
back. When the unfortunate woman found
him not, these same words were used : A
'I must wait up for my dear Pierre!'
Nothing would induce her to go to bed..-
She would place herself in a chair beside the
vacant .cradle-which it would seem she
imagined to contain her darling girl-.and
sing to its fancied occupant, until, overcome
with weariness, she dropt asleep.
The kind-~earted neighbors, who had loved
her from tier infancy, took it by turns to
watch for thi&amp; moment of oblivion of her
sorrows, and seized the opportunity to carry
her gently and place her quietly in her own
bed, where every morning she would find
herself, without question or surprise.
Sometime, however, it happened, in con-
sequence of the confusionn and dread' that
reigned around, that the poor harmlessmaniac
was~ neglected by these generous women;
but this, it must be said, was a rare thing.
This night she was thus unwatched; andy
as we have said, it was indeed a dark and
dreary night.
In the otter.rooifl was but one individual,
the only sentinel at hedd-quarters. It was
our old acquaintance, Nicholas 'Godard, the
plough-boy' and jester, whom neither past ex-
perience or present danger had cured of 'his
facetious' pranks and love of joking.
The present occupation of Nicholas, how-
ever, seern~d to 'be anything but of an agree-

Courage, as we have already seen, was not
the distinguishing characteristic of this rti~tjc,
and this formidable equipment was not enough
to put him at ease; yet, to wile away the
time, keep up appearances, and re-assure him-
self, as best he might. Nicholas kept whistling
the same tune over and over without cessa-
tionsave the interruption of a few tremendous
yawns and grunts.
Suddenly this hero hears a rap at the
door.
Wlto-who-who-goes there?' with fal-
tering voice he faintly murmured, and takes
refuge beside the gun, presenting his pitch-
fork.
'It is only I, you fool, you! It is Jacijues
Chanul'
As soon as Nicholas knew who it was, he
put on a bold kihk, brandished his fork and
opened the door to the peasant.
'I believe I frightened you, not a little,' said
Jacques.
'That is a good joke! frightened nm, in-
deed! Say rather how well I acted the part
of a brave soldier.'
'To admirationT truly!' was the mocking
assent.
Did 1 not speak out boldly and gruffly. I
can assure you tl4at I am' txo chicken-hearted
fellow to be so easily scared. You must
have heard my formidable challenge, 'Who
goes there ?'
'Certainly; having uncommonly sharp
ears, I confess that I did hear those warlike
words.'
'How strangely you -talk, man! Why, I
tell you if~ the whole band of the incendiaries
were to come here and attack me, I would
not give way one inch.'
'That is perfectly true, Nicholas: for 'of
course your back would be resting against
the wall. You would not retreat. You would
hold your ground, or your wall would hold
you. It is all the smime."'
Nicholas, finding it impossible to remove
the impression of cowardice which the newly-
arrived evidently ascribed to him,' was very
much vexed-for Jacques lived at Fleudnes,
not at Brasseuse, and the tale would spread-
but, without debating the point, changed the
subject, by saying,-
'Has anything new occurred,' that you have
come here to-hight?'
'No.' I had a load to take to Brasseuse,
so I thought I would just come over here and

such a savage, violent man.'
'Plague take the old wretch, with his night-.
watches and patrols, which he has brought
into fashion,' said Chanu, apparently satisfied
with'the lucid explanation given by Nicholas.
"I won't' say but walking about all night
with lanterns,' he continued, 'is a good'thing
'to terrify the villains who' are ruining the
country with their fires; but since'we~ are 'to
have all this labor, I think the Major 'ought
to pay the cost.'
'But,' rejoined Nicholas, 'we must all jdih
in this soldier-work: for' it is all of us who
are being burned 'out of house and home,
and cattle, and everything; and besides that,
some people already, you know, have lost

'Why, then, are not these villains ariest..

"No, I know better than that. It is no~ to

'Not I, indeed,' replied the peasant of
Fleurines. I am not the' fool. You say no

?eople may. pretend not to see who is con-
cerned in this horrid incendiarism; but they
know well enough. I could name one, at
any rate, if I chose to spt~ak; but you have
called me a fool: besides, that haM customer,
I~ecadi, might ruin me if I spoke out.'
'BahI impossible! You could do-no such
~hing. Yet, I don'tknow;, perhaps you..are
right,' said Nicholas Godard, passing at ouch
4rorn astonishment and positive denial to
doubt and ready credulity.
'I tell yoi.. it is just as I have stated.'
'Yes, indeed, it. may be, so,' thoughtfully
replica Nicholas. 'They ought surely to
have taken one or two qf the incendiaries by
~this 1mw, if they had really been in earnest.
~Unn there be anything underhanded that we
bave not thought of, 1 wonder.'
'There. is a name which, if I weren'tt
afraid of somebody, I could mentiQll as .one
of the terrible gang.'
'surely you are not 'afraid of nw, .yQur
&amp;iend, are you?'
The loQk which Jacques Chanu turned and
fixed on the speaker was eloquent in the ex-
land served for sufficient reply to this
qyestion.
So Nicholas continue4,-
'Well, my good fellow, do tell me whom
you suspect.'
Lowering his voice, the countryman from
ur.ines replied:
:' My opinion is, that Pierre Aukin .is one
of them.'
Qraj~ious Heavens! Pierre Aubin?' ex-
claimed Nicholas, in utter amazement.
'Yes, I rep~tt the name, Pierre 4~bin,

'Well, .1 believe that you have the best of

'Have not all these fires taken place since

months.'
'During all of which time Pierre Auhin

'Yes.'
'How comes this ?-and why has the name,

'Indeed I cannot say; but are you sure o4'

Also, it is only three 'days since Pierre's hat

of the house that was consumed near
Fleurines.'
'So-so! It would seem that the old
soldier is in league with the devilish incen-
diaries !" observed Nicholas, quite staggered
with The new aspect of affairs; 'if not, why
did he make a secret of his son-in-law's shoe

case.'
'I do not say~ positively,' rejoined Chanu;
I but I think that more improbable things have
happened~'
'It is a pretty joke, certainly? that we
should'stay here to guard his house, while he
is away ponrtiying at those who are burning
Qur qwn houses,' said Nicholas, indignantly.
'Yes, under pretence of taking care of a
sick woman,' continued Chanit; and he
added: 'I should like to know what for she

'Perhaps ~ remarked Nicholas Godard,
quite unsuspiciously.
Two o'clock' struck at this ji~nct!.ire, and

the voices of Decadi Robert and his detaoh-
ment were heard approaching. the house.
Chanu felt alarmed at' his accusation of
Cecil&amp;s father.
'Good-night! I must be off!' said he;
'but I advise you not to repeat what I have
been '~aying to you, or mention my name in
the m~itter, or I -will break every bone in your
body, as sure as there is a single bone io it.'
With this threat, the peasant disappeared.
Nicholas 'Godard ,needed' not this denuncia-
tion, to keep him silent, for intuitvely he
knew that direful consequences to himself
would attend his opening his mouth, which
he inwardly determined to keep closed, if
possible, dreading, above all things, the ange
of Decadi.
As the party reached the house, the clown
appeared at the door, yawning and lazily
stretching his tired limbs. his listless looks
relieved the mind of the anxious parent, who
thus expressed himself:
'The stupid animal would not have dared
to await my return if anything had happened
to my poor girl. Nicholas thinks too much
of his ugly carcass, to put himself in my
way when I am justly enraged. No-she
must be safe.'
Thus the good old man reasoned aloud,
and allayed his fears.
Nicholas made his military salute, more to
show his skill and fine figure, than out of re-
spect to his superior, who just at that very
instant heard his name called in loud and
piteous tones,, at some little distance. lie
turned with undefined nervousness to see who
at such an hour was calling to him.
It was Genevieve Morvan, the nurse of (
little Philiberte. Her. hair was streaming in
the wind, her arms spread out wildly, and t
her whole appearance indicating great dis- t
tress. .
Ror a moment, Decadi was thunderstruck;
he trembled with dismay at the foreboding v
sensation he experienced.
As he advanced to meet the woman, he ~
exclaimed,-                              s
'Is your cottage on fire? Speak! . Yet
that cannot .-be, or else you would. have l~

'What I you robbed 2 Wfrat can they hay.

Alas, alas! Philiberte.'
'Stolen from your ho~ise, my darling?

'To-night.'
'By whom?'
'I know not.'
'You must then have gone out and left the
infant alone?'
'I only went for a few minutes to take1a
little drop of'krandy to my good man w$o
was on guard.'
'Wretch!' cried Decadi, transported wi~1i
rage, and raising his hand involuntarily, asjf
to strike her, then recollecting himself ai~,d
checking the violent and disgraceful demon-
stration -'--' We must inquire of all the neigh-,

'I have done so,' sobbed the poor woma.p,'
'already, and no onehas seen or heard ~m~y

'Who could have any interest in stealg

'The fact is,' replied the agitated 'nur~e,
'that not once only, but more than ten tirn~s

'Who?'
'Her mother.'

side her own.
The indiscreet visitor, instead of accepting
the offer made-we will confess solely out of
politeness, and not from any desire to detain
the unloved 'bridegroom-motioned his ac-
knowledgment, but remained standing.
Regina was delighted: for she concluded
thence, that the visit would be short; so
smiling graciously, she remarked:
'I see I shall not have the pleasure of de-
taining you long at Gazeran to-night.'
'I say not that, dear cousin.' I had the
honor, on first presenting myself~to mention
that I wished for a short interview with you.'
Agatha kept her post.
Honored looked at the abigail, and then at
the mistress, expecting the dismissal of the
former, which he had not, as yet, the 'power
to command. It was quite plain that the
waiting~maid was a restraint that, he wished
removed. But Agatha only laughed in her
sleeve, without budging; and though Regina
knew very well his r*ieaning, she pretended
not to perceive his drift, and looked as if she
expect'~d him to explain.
Honor sighed, took her delicate hand, and
pressed it awkwardly to' his lips.
Regina laughed outright; the gentleman
was disconcerted.
'Well,' said he, 'what is there so amusing
that you mock me thus?'
At the same time, Jlonore cast a glance at
his figure, as reflected in th~ splendid glass,
to see if anything, in his well-ordered ap-
parel, was unsuitable or amiss; or if there was
anything ridiculous about his appearance.
The examination was satisfactory to his
vanity: for he was a noble-looking man; but
he caught the reflection of the impertinent
smile of Agatha. Ha! thought he, you shall
walk pretty soon after I shall have become
master at Gazeran!
Honore had retained the pretty little hand
of Regina during this short interval. She
drew it from his amorous grasp, saying, play-
fully,-.' Truly, if you have nothing more
pressing to say, and only such flattering
little gallantries to demonstrate, it would be
as well, methinks, to postpone them till
to-morrow-so now I will wish you good
night.'
There was no mistaking the lady's wish
to terminate the visit, nevertheless thic-cava-
her replied :- and dear cou~ln~
'Pardon me, my fair                but

engaged as we are, I thought ~[ might in~.
trude this evening, to ask leave to introduce
my companions-my three brothers,-wh~
have accompanied me to your castle.'
Regina looked surprised, and' cooJy re-
sponded.
'I am very sorry that they should bave
taken this trouble, but at this l1'our it is out
of the question for me to receive them.'.
'By Jove, Madam, I am fully sensible of'
my importunity,' persisted Honore, 'but I
am bound to tell you that we cannot return
without having held a conference on a really
important subject which has occasioned this -
inopportune visit.'
'Why cannot your business-since busi..
ness it seems has brought' you hither-be
put off until to morrow?'
"To-morrow will be too joyous an occa~
sion to deal with any thing of so serious, so
painful a nature, a matter, in fact, which it
is necessary should precede the happy cerc-
mony 'of our nuptials.' -
At this grave speech Regina's counte-
nance became clouded, a vague uneasiness,,
pervaded her mind, though she could not, as.
yet, penetrate the motive of this visit, or
the meaning of these ominous words. Still,
as she spoke not, the intruder continued,-
'You see, therejore, that whilst I regret
disturbing you, I cannot delay the intervte~.
I solicit for my brothers and myself-'
but I promise to limit it to that only about
which it is strictly essential to come to ax~.
und~rstanding-and to that we doubtless .
shall arrive.'
The conclusion of this sentence was em-
phasized in a manner, and. spoken with: a.
look' which denoted some hidden meatting.,
Regina regarded the speakerr with a fixed,.
piercing look; but the prudent Honore had
resumed his ordinarily smiling' and ,placid.
expression of countenance-so that tbe ~ob-
ject' of' the ' brothers, in this uncooked for
visit, was still unsurmised, and sh~ ~aid,-
'As your business is so pressing ap4 im-

The silence whIch er~sued was etTabar-,

the imagination of the bride at this 'myste~

heye they come!'
I shall soon know, thot~ht the anxious
lady; and with a forced smile she addressed
the brothers as they entered
'Will you explain, gentlemen, what has
procured me this honor 'I'
They looked surprised, for they had taken
it for granted that he whom it most con-
cerned would have explained the purport
of their visit. They were there not to speak,
f/ut to act.
Honor was ashamed, yet finding him-
self called upon to say something in expla-
nation, he made an effort-but his natu~a1
timidity prevented his utterance, and with
an appealing look to' his brothers to come
to his aid, he remained silent.
'Do you know,' said Regina, in tones
which she meant to be playful, but which
betrayed her nervous excitement (caused
by the1 terrible alarm which she really felt)
-' Do you know, my gdbd sirs, that so
much hesitation and mystery are very alarm-
ing? The affair you come about must be
very unpleasant to' speak of- as Honore
dares not utter it! If you, who are men,
have not courage to speak-I begin to fear
that I, being but a mere woman, shall not
have the nerve to listen.'
James, who was a blutit-spoken man-a
ivan of middle size, with a narrow fore-
head, small eyes, his features rendered harsh
by deep marks of small-pox, besides hav-
ing his left cheek scarred by a sabre-cut-
took upon himself to address the lady of
Gazeran,-~-
'Why, you see, cousin, it relates to a
veiy plain matter, a matter of course, and
one which Honore .ought to have mention-~
cii to you, himself, since~it is he whom
y0u are about to marry, and, consequently,
4'hom it most concerns. He. has scruples,
or is afraid to speak, he is bashful-though
so near the wedding this delicacy is folly.
There ought to be an end to it, and
I' will be plain and candid. I am a free-
spoken man.' -
'Can "any one overhear . us?' inquired
flonore, looking uneasily around.
'No, it i~ impossible-continue, I be-
sceech you!' said Regina wiih feverish mo-
tion, and addressing James, who accord~
ingly proceeded, though in a somewhat
1ower tone.
'We have come to speak about the man

who is here.'
Stunned by this announcement, and speak-
ing as if she had not "rightly understood,
Regina ejaculated-
'What did you say?'
~The prisoner whom you have had here
for two months, we mean,' said William.
'Well, what of him?' gasped the lady,
supportng herself with difficulty on the
back of a chair.
Antoine, the shrewd dwarf, who had stood
aloof, in a corner, noticed her troubled
manner, an~ muttered very low-
'It is as I guessed.'
Honore now spoke to his betrothed in
his softest tones,-
'Well, my beautiful bride, this man has
been a prisoner long enough; he cannot
remain forever, where we left him!'
'No doubt he is weary of coufinement,'
observed the dwarf with a cruel sneer.
'In short, I have said it, my lady of
Gazeran-there must be an end made to
him. We must finish him.' brutally blunt-
ed out the former speaker, James.
'Finish him! What do you mean, gen-
tlemen?' said Regina, with such visible
anxiety that it could not escape the vigi-
lant notice of Antoine.
On my soul, I,      think there could
be no mistaking the meaning of these words,
no two ways about it!' drily remarked
William.
'Yes!' continued James, 'the existence
of this man is an insult to you, Madam.
To us it is an annoyance, and we have
come to remove the cause of embarrass-
ment.-He must die.'
Regina shuddered, and exclaimed,-
'Die! It is murder!'
'Listen to me, dearest,' said Honore,
persuasively modulating his accents-' You
need not be frightened~ my love; you are
not called' upon to take any part in that
which has to be, or even to know any
thing about what takes place. This man,
you have', informed us, has dured to insult
you with' his' love, to persecute you with
his scandalous passion. Your courage alone
preserved you from being dishonored. This
man~ deserves to be punished. *This man

'Then you have resolved to put him to'
death ?' asked Regina, looking from one to
another of the brothers, who remained un-
moved.
James ,-not knowing what to make of
the Strange expression of her features, which
Antoine readily comprehended,-bnisqueI1~
replied,-' Of course, Madam, you will not
wish him to be taken hence, eh!'
'No, I would have him remain where you,'
yourselves, my avengers, placed him; b~t I
would have him left alive.'
'A woman's plan I-' object~l William,
shrugging his shoulders. 'Revenge is sweet-
er for being prolonged-but you must be
content with having enjoyed that pleasure
for the last two months. It is not proper,
under the circumstances, to continue it
longer. Once again, I siy, there must 'be
an end to it.'
'It is plain,' added the dwarf, in his little
shrill, harsh voice, 'that each hour of this
man's life is dangerous to us.'
'Lower, brother! Speak lower!' said the
timd Honore, fearful that the terrible 'con-
versation might, in part, be heard from with-
out. 'Of course it is all settled, and' the'
lady of ~iazeran will give us the key of the
dungeon. The game-keeper, I suppose, is
still in the Same place?'
At this question a deep blush arose to the
very forehead' of the lady, though' none of
them attributed it to the true cause.
'All that we want is this key-the rest
follows, of course. We should not have
had to tease you with the unpleasant subject,
had you left it with us as we desired. The
thing would have been done by now, and
you would have known nothing about it,'
remarked William with perfect sang-froid!
Regina shuddered with horror as ~he
ahstractedly regarded the vile wretches who
spoke, and flonore nervously added-A.
'The night is dark, the wind blows a hur-
ricane. Every body in ~he castle will ~soon
be asleep, so we need fear nointerruption in
this indispensible execution. Besides, the
dungeon is in the other wing of the castle,
under the gi~and saloon which is ui~ocou-
pied.'
'Certainly,' said Antoine, 'the old dt~n-
geons are situated on the other side. Below
this, Madam, I suppose tbere are none '?'
'None!' falsely affirmed' Regiua.'-.bub h~r
voice was unsteady, and a deadly paleri~ss

came over her.
'Then every thing is favorable,' repliedV
flon~te.

needed!' bluntly remarked James.
'Yes; truly,' was the dwart~s answer.

st~pi'mered.
'How dreadful!' said the really frightened
Pierre. Then after'listening a moment with'
breathless eagerness, he added,-

'I tell you tome one is coming. Alas,
they must have discovered our flight!'
Who?'
'Those who carried you off.'
'It was not by your orders, "then, Mad-

'I was obliged to permit it, but it was not
my wish. I am at their castle.'
'At V~dganest?'
'Yes, at Valganest,' she boldly affirmed.
'How came you here, yourself, Madam?'
Instead of replying, Regina pretended
a fre~h alarm.
"'1~hey are coming, I am sure. Fly that
way, until the danger is past. It is your
only chance.'
As the artful woman said this she pointed
in the direction she wished him to take, and
Pierre, misled by her well-acted terror did
as he was desired.
'Go on,' said she, 'I will wait a moment
to listen whether they have hit upon our
track.'
Soon she was flying 'after him. Agony
was in her voice~ as ,on reaching him she
exclaimed,-
'F'ly quicker, they are at hand. I would
have saved you I .They will not spare me
now! It is over with us both!'
There was such, an appearance of sin-
cerity in the delivery of this speech, and the
voices and footsteps of the two. fugitives
reverberated with so confused and echoing, a
sound, that it was not haid 'to V

Regina was now sure of having her prey

rough st6ne wall,' with marvellousagility she

Truly should I have been foolish to permit
you t6 learn from other lips than mine-that
you are not at Valganest, but at Gazeran.'
Then to give' her conduct the color of' a
recent change of intention, she~continued,-
'Happily your ingratitude opened my
eyes, in time, to the imprudence which 'I
was about to commit. Now, and forever
are you in my power, obdurate man!'
Confounded by this bold deception, and
fallen from such bright hopes to the depth of
despair, the wretched man was, at first,
unable to move or speak. He was over-
whelmed by this apparent refinement on
cruelty-raising hopes purposely to disap-
point them, and thatwith no visible motive-
for Regina withheld the fact that this change
of' prison would, at least, secure him from
the attempts of others, on his life.
As soon as the. unfortunate Pierre recov
ered from the first shock, he used his now
unmanacled limbs, in violent efforts to burst
the door-but it resisted all his power. Fu-
rious at his impotence to escape, he vocife-
rated a torrent of invectives on his tormenter
and betrayer.
To which the only reply she vouchsafed
was-
'Pierre, you may one day learn that 1
spoke but the truth, in saying that I came to
save you!'
Regina then withdrew, the captive watch-
ing her retiring figure (through the key-
hole) until the closing of a second door,
which was at the end of the corridor, ex-
cluded him from the rest of his species.
We have thus' seen how the game-keeper
had exchanged one dungeon for another,
where he had languished ever since, seeing
the face of no living creature, not even that
of his beautiful' j~tilor, who attended dail~r,

~gina adventured on the e~e of her bridal.
Thi~ determined woman had settled in
her o~vn' tidod, how to act according to
whichever., alternative' the 'c~~tive might
choose to adopt. She had closed all the

doors behind her, as usual, except the last,
that already spoken of at' the end of the
corridor. On this occasion her agitation
was not counterfeit-even, she trembled, at
the possibility that Pierre might refuse her
offer, knowing the fatal consequence-.-his
intended immediate destruction. She 'felt
that sho had need of all her indomitable
spirit, to sustain her in this trying hour.
No sound could the agitatedworutin de..
tect by placing her ear to the door of his
cell! Silence reigned as in the grave!
'Pierre! Pierre!' she crIed, in her sweet-
nest and most impassioned accents.
No answer was returned.
Regina was alarmed at the complete ab-
sence of all movement or sound within.
Clambering up to the wicket, by help of the
irregularity of the damp stones of which the
massive wall was built, she directed the rays
of the lantern, 'so as to get a view of the
tuterior before opening the door.
The prisoner was quietly seated on the
miserable bed in the corner of his cell.
Looking up. he cast a glance of disdain at
Regina, who exclaimed,-
'Pierre, oh my dear Pierre, why do you
preserve so long a silence-silence to me so
painful! Still mute I But you cannot help
hearing me. This even is a consolation to
mc. Besides, I see you, and I blush not to
avow that my happiness depends on this
satisfaction.'
.Still no reply, and Regina continued,-
'I would much rather heat' your angry
reproaches, than~ endure this maddening
silence. I suffer as well as you. Indeed
you may believe mel Your fate is bad
enough, but mine is infinitely worse '1
know you have lost confidence in my pro-
fessions-because you believe I have already
once betrayed you. But whether you believe'
~me or not, I assure you~ with sacred truth,
that to this forced treachery you owe your
life-for your abductors would have mur-
dered you. But for me you would not, at
this instant, be alive! I only deceived in

Regina expected that this declaration
w9uld have produced some' effect. in het~
favor, and to observe, if possible, what sort'
of feeling her touching address had. pro-
.duced, sh~ peered intently through the
grated aperture.
Pierre merely shrugged his shoulders, and.

turned away his head contemptuously.
'Oh, but this is dreadful! He will ,no~
listen to me! He does not believe me I
how shall I. gain credit for my assertions! *
Pierre, I swear, by every thing that is sacred.

night you would have been murdered.'
'No, not so!' replied he. 'To do that
they must have caught me napping,-~--an4
this night I could not sleep! There is no
sleep for me!'
Without noticing the ironical tone of these
words, and their ambiguous sense, Regina~,
too happy to think of aught else, cried out1
joyfully,-
'Thank goodness I hear you speak once
more! No, Pierre, they cannot 'kill you~
for I will not have it so. I will guard your
life,, for it is more precious to rue than my,
own existence. You are my property-my
treasure-and to none but to me shall you

inors were rife against them on so many
grounds.
It was not difficult to scale the outer. wall
and gain admittance to the dwelling which
~bey had never entered but once, which was
on the memorable evening when the singulmir
proposition of their father was made known
-to them.
'Here we are, and there is time enough
before daylight for us to make thorough
rummage in ~vcry nook and corner-but
what are we 'o do for a light ?-it is pitch-
dark within,' said Antoine.
'It cannot be,' replied Honore, 'that he
who left such a sum of money behind him
could be so' stingy as to have used up every
bit of candle in the house, or carried off the
last match; and if the bId woman has pot
stolen it, there surely ought to be a tinder-
box somewhere.'
This seemed plausible, so they descended
,~' to the kitchen, and began groping about to
discover, by feeling, the means Qf striking a
light. As Antoine was stretching up to the
chimney-piece, the toe of his boot happened
to touch the ashes on the hearth, and dis-
covered some live coals~' The brothers, were
amazed and startled at this phenQmenon.
James laid his hand on the ashes-they were
hot Trembing all over, at this discovery,
Ilonure said, 'some one must inhabit this
house at the present time-and yet it was
but yesterday that Bartholomew assured us
that it h~d been vacant ever since the disap-
pearance of the Major, which we know is
more than a year.'
'We shall soon ascertain, for certain, for
prudence demands that we search every room
above and below, to discover whether there
is any one in the house besides ourselves,~
firmly spoke William.
'What if we should encounter a stran-
ger?'
'No matter, we must say that we have
lost our way, and are seeking shelter until
morning.'
This point settled, ther&amp;was no diflioulty
in kiiidliag a blaze, by the light of which
they discovered a piece of a candle, and
then they commenced a regular, but unsuc..
cosaful, research ,for the two hundred thou~
sand francs.
Ja vain they sounded the waIls, and peered
into every place capable, or likely t~ con-
ceal the missing treasure or a ~myste~ious

inhabitant. Saving the glowing embers
everything betokened that the place: had
long been, and still remained altogether
uninhabited.
'We are alone in the House!' said James.
'And yet,'; replied Honore, 'some one
must have been here, and that lately, for the
fire could not have kindled itself-or the
ashes 'retain heat for a year. To believe
that would be to give credit to fairy-tales.'
'Or to believe in ghosts,' murmured
Honor, with a singular expression of voice.
He' wished to appear brave and scepti5al,
whilst, in reality, he was a coward'.
Antoine bad been silent and thoughtful
for some moments, apparently absorbed ip
unpleasant reflection. lie was, in truth,
passing in review all that occurred in the
late visit to Regina, and the belief that they
bad been iniposed on by the beautiful lady of
the castle, Was' rapidly gaining strength and
shape. Suddenly he exclaimed ~
'Gentlemen, we have been duped'! I
would lay my life on it! Our sister-in-law,
that is to be, has deceived us! Pierre Anbin,
you riiay depend on it, is no longer at Gaze-
ran!'
The brother s could no~ credit this a~sei~-
tion. What motive could Regina hai~efor
doing so'~ This they though;, and to this
effect they expressed thcms~lves.
'Blind must you be not to see that she
madly loves the game-keeper. Each lo6k
'and word betrayed her, and yet you~ sus-
pected It not.'~ So spoke the dwarf.
'Can it be possible?' exclaimed the'in~dig-
nant bridegroom. 'The question 'at pres-
ent,' continued Antoine, 'is not how this
affects you individually, brother; we must
only consider how to discover what haw be-
come of the wretch whom you ,spared~ why
I know not, when it would have been so easy
to have settled him for ever I'

tion was not ~qnick enongh, at once, t~i s~ige

so speedily to a conclusion-' but what ~

can I inceount for h~r tinwillin~ness to per-

which, ostensibly, she acquiesced.' AL~other,

'Too true!' gloomily responde4-the others.
'Bt~t before saying any thing to Regina
on the subject,' interposed Honore, 'it would
be well to make ~ure, positively, that the
man is actually no longer in his dungeon.
We have yet' two hours to day-light, and
Gazeran is but three quarters of a league
distant hence.- To korse--- To Gazeran.'
- Silence again reigned within the deserted
rooms, as the excited party rode rapidly
back to the castle they had visited once
before on this eventful night.
The ashes were still hot on the forsaken
heirth, how they became so remained a
mystery!
* Well did the brothers remember the vari-
ous turnings and windiiigs, which Regina
had directed them how to follow, beneath
the inhabited part of the castle, in order to
reach the dungeon-vaults wh~re they were
to deposit the unhappy victim-the game-
keeper-.--on the occasion of their carrying
him off-and easily did they force admittance,
for what scruples could they have about
scaling a wall or forcing locks, who had
none in taking the life of a fellow-creature,
and he, moreover, the beloved son of their
father?
We have seen that the lady had refused
them the keys of the three intervening doors,
but these obstacles deterred them not, each
successively gave way to their united efforts
and the brothers reached the corridor that
led to the original dungeon of Pierre Aubin.
Here there was rio lock to force-the door
was open-~--the flag-stone displaced-the
prison-vault empty V.
James and William uttered exclamations
of rage. Honor became pale and speech-
less with mortification and jealousy.
'As to Antoine he spake not a word
but immediately let himself down into the
yawning tomb. He determined to make
sure of the worst,
'Well?' eagerly called his brothers from
above.    -
'No one is here!' was the instant r~ply.
'Then come up Antoine,' they said,
str~tching down their arms to assist his
ascent.       was about
-The  it~ar~f         to com~Iy, when
suddenly l~e shouted-' Wait.'

'Have you made any discovery? What
is it?
'Perhaps so-but wait I say-we shall
soon see:'
The -light vanished and the figure of
Antoine disappeared from the view of the
three brothers.
Twice the impatient and astonished Ho-
nore called for the dwarf-but no answer
was returned, and they, all, were at a loss to
account for this strange disappearance.
'We most follow lest any mischance befall
him,' cried James, leaping down into the
lower vault, tind his brothers followed his
example. The darkness did not admit their
distinguishing any object, but they felt
around the damp walls -of the six - feet
square, dungedh-over the rugged floor and
across the empty space.
Honor speedily remarked, that the air,
instead of only coming down from above,
blew on hi~ cheek from one side.
Having their attention turned to this little
circumstance, the rest agreed that so it was.
Let us leave th~in-to seek an explana-
tion of this current of air, and the sudden
disappearance of Antoine-and return to
those whom we left in circumstances- so
perilous and seemingly desperate. -

THE Lady of Gazeran and the gam~-keep-
er of the forest of Brasseuse wer~i alone and
locked up in the most secret dungeons of the
Castle, at the very time whilst the aristocrat
brothers were exploring the deserted cell in
which 'they had deposited their victim.
In the delirium of her passion, the beauti-

and high rank, was here self-immolated, and

formidable and relentless, joined her hands in
earnest entreaty,
Pierre, 'in surprise and perplexity, gazed
on her suspiejously, to discover if she was
speaking in sincerity or mockery.
When'the words really proceed from the
heart, they find a response that carries instant
conviction, of their, truthfulness. Pierre dis-
trusted her no longer.
With renewed hope and ardor, he once
more ventures into the narrow outlet, which
would lead to safety or tke grave.
Thp key turns again in thebock. R~egina,
by a sudden inspiration, throws the mattress
over the aperture, and extinguishes the light.
The rusty ,wards have at length been. over-
come, the door is unlocked, and yet it does
not open.
'It.must be held from within,? said Honore.
'Of course, he is trying to keep us Out,?
remarked Antoine.
'But we are four to qne,' continued James;
and with his powerful fist he struck the door
a tremendons blow.
It gave way, but instantly re-close5l.
Antoine, in~tead, of lending his assi~tanc,
to this effect, clambered up once more to the
bars, and, casting the rays 'of the lantern on
the interior of the cell, called out,-
'Pierre is not there! It is our cousip who
is holding 'the door l'
The last words of the dwarf were unheard,
for, pushing with all theirmight, they burst

Not suspecting that Pi~trre Auble wa

to revive the fainting lady, who, knowing th
value to the fugitive of every montent's de
lay, was in no haste to recover.

at the door, whilst the other two were ocen

ance, and eager to be the one tolay hands oj~
the hated game-keeper, rushed towards the
prisoner's bed. Raising the mattress, he per-
ceived the excavation beneath, .at which sighi
he uttered, a piercing cry. of baffled rage.
Like a wild beast entering its.deji, did the
dwarf disappear in the narrow subterranean
passage;. but he soon, returned, and announc-
ed, in tones of disappointed hate, that there
was no outlet to the hole, thathe had follow'-
ed the p~issage until fitrther progress was ob-
structed by a large flag-stone whieh he had
found it impossible to re[nove.
Regina, whose anxiety had been intense
during the exploration (by ,the dwarf) of the
avenue to escape and freedom, now raised
her eyes, with gratitude, to Heaven, and
breathed freer. She ret~diiy guessed that
Pierre had taken the precaution to 'interpose,
between him apd' his adyersaries, the .obst~-

Re-called, by the speech of the wood-cut-

inquired the 'way to Brasseuse. Having ob~

thoughts still bent on 'the child h~ had seen,

beings the dearest of all on earth to him; and
he felt not the 'length or loneliness of his
journey.

er, the village of Brasseuse, in all its altered
aspect. So great was the change since the
burning'of 'La rangeg' farm-house, that he
fancied he must have mistaken the way, and
that it 'was some other village that he beheld
in the distance. During his captivity,' the
fires had, unknown to him, been doing their
devastating work.
Ignorant of' all that had passed beyond his
prison walls, no wonder that Pierre Aubin
was confounded with astonishment as he
looked around 'him. Enough of the ruined
houses, however, remained standing, to satis-
fy him that he had not gone astray, and that
the dwelling of his loved ones was before him.
But soon a new cause of wonder presented
itself. His progress was suddenly arrested
by a fixed bayonet thrust right before him as
he musing'iy sauntered along, and a voice in
quaking accents nieiiaced him with death.
'Halt! Approach a step, and I fire.'
Pierreat once recognized Nicholas Godard,
the plough-boy and jester, in the would.be

soldier.

babe theie, whilst on her w'ay' to Gar~erari,
which they had made out from her incohe-

There was 'great and fresh &amp;ause for alarm!
Had the unf~rtuna'te woman reached her ii-
val's castle previous to his quitting it? Was'
this the solution of Regina's permitting him
escape? Perhaps she knew full well the

What dreadful' doubts to assail an affec-
tioruate and devoted husband! Poor Cecile!
so gentle! How would her crushed spirit
bear this additional misery, if indeed, sepa-
rated from child as well as husband, she were
captive to' the fierce and 'vindictive lady of
Gazeran, and perchance now an inmate of
that dreadful dungeon from which the game-
keer had but' just' emerged!
Pierre Aubin determined, at all hazard to
himself, to return and learn the 'worst. Ilair-
ing with difficulty obtained permirr~ion, from
the old woman, td'embrace the in~nt.le~ in

once again set out' on his travels.
Disappointment 'still awaited him. On
reaching 'the castle he learned to his dismay
that' Regina had left at dawn fbr Paris! In
reply to his eager and almost frantic inquiry,
whether Cecile had been 'there, he was as-
sured she had not-but she had been seen
wandering in the forest like a crazy woman.
It was, by this time, evening, and faint
weary and sorrowful Pierre retraced his steps
to the hut, where hi&amp; child had been left,
trusting 'That maternal instinct' would bring
the wanderer there, 'i*~ unharmed 'and at Ii-
be~'ty. -
It happened that the old couple, who lived

Pierre had requested permission to await
the return of the mother oCthe child entrust-
~d them, and they dared not refYise him.
Truly they fancied it was but a pretext, and
that he was one, of the band of incendiaries,
whom it would be as dangerous to affront as
to retain. This was quite natural and made
them, whilst fearful, assume to be hospital~le.
Feeling hungry, and wishing to propitiate
the'poor people, the gamekeeper' pouredd the
contents of his leather purse on the table,
and begged the woman to give him some
supper and allow him to lodge with them for
the night. Now this purse whs pretty well
filled, containing the sum provided f6r the
minor expenses of the christening, having
remained untouched in his pocket ever since1
that disastrous occasioti.
This liberal payment, for wretched fare,
confirmed the prejudiced mincA of his hosts,
against the man so meanly clad. Every ex-
cuse was made to get rid of him. They said
that the had nb spare bed-but he replied
that he i~ouId willingly sleep on the 'floor by
the 'fire.
Ak ! thought the aifrighted paid-out fate
is settle! Our humble abode is marked out
as the next prey to the devouring flames!
They resolved at all events not to pass the
night with this terrible man. 'So they con-
sulted, apart, and riade up a little plot for the
h~isband to denounce him whilst pretending
t~ be seeking a bed at the nijller's, that t~e

usually prolonged absence of Antoine, audhe
gan to be uneasy on his ac~ount. The letter,
perhaps might explain the cause and enlight-
en them. At all events they decided that
the circumstance justified opening a letter
plainly intended for him.
How were they then surprised at the con-
tents, which Honore read aloud, as follows-
'The burning of the woodman's hut is
to' lead to the discovery, of the instiga-
Iik:ly you, whom it most concerns~ if found
orsof the other conflagrations. I hasten
out, that Clodomir was caught on the spots
and is in the keeping of the Gendarmes. The
wood-cutter also is in custody, and the in-
habitants of Brasseuse are coming en masse
0your castle. If you have any papers that
~n compromise yourself, or any of us, de-
stroy the documents immediately.-..an hour
hence will be too late.'
This revelation of a secret, which Antoine
had kept from his brothers, tilled them with
indignation and concern. They had admit-
ted him into their fullest confidence, and now
they accidental learnt his participation in a
crime, that had devastated the country, of
which they were guiltless. For though these
men scrupled not to~ use any means to further
their own interest or gratify revenge and
hate, yet they were not familiarised with
guilt, simply for the pleasure of inflicting
misery on others. But right or wrong, An-
toine was in danger, and his peril night af-
fect themselves also.
'If the people force an eritranqe here' oh
served Honore, 'there is something tjnmt np
one ought to see-and yet It is liable ,t~ be
found.'
He spoke of the chest whjch had been de-
posited in the room which Antoine had not
used since. Many times they had resolved
to remove it, and yet had always put it off,
a feeling of horror making tb~m dread to

CHAPTER XIV.               - -
It is time now to e~tplain how Pierre, his
wife, and her unknown protector, came Icr
meet on the eminence adjoining the village
of Vilvert at the critical time of the confla-
gration of the woodman's hut. ' -
At day-break of that morning the present
guardian of Cecile, whilst wandering about
the skirts of the forest on the Vilvert side,
ha~discovered -the unfortunate woman in -a
fain~iing condition, at the foot of a tree where
she had dropped down overcome with fatigue
and alarm.
All night, after leaving her child at the
wopd~cutter's, had she beenT in the damp airy
She had been captured by a party of .tbe
bandits, and was terrified almost to d~ath-at
their. srreech-owlcry, which vividly - brought
back the events that had driven her to rnadr'
ness.                                L.
The signal, this time oft repeated, brought
around her, such. a fierce group that, she
flung herself at the keeper's feet -and wildly
pleaded Coin her, life. -
Convinced that her insanity was not as~
sunied, they took phy on her and revoked
their purpose of-death, but impressed on ~her
feeble senses-that if she, would save her
hu~band'~ life, and if she hoped~ ever tq see
her child~again,.shemuust repeat-to every body
the words they tel4 her, namely- -
There is~ut -Pie' incendiary~ and that is
Pierr~e Aubin-L h~v0 seen him~' ' , --
Having-thus. pinovk~ed for their owp secu~
rity and the furtherance of the enmity ag~n~
her husband, Ceoile was escorted -for som
hours, by two hf the men, through ~o ~n~py
paths-ef-the forest that, even had she posses-


R1~O~A.                         7tt

sed all her faculties as fully as eVer, she could
tiot have guided any one 'to the secrefrendez-
vous of the incendiary-gang.
When found by the stranger, the poor
creature was senseless and" nearly frozen.
He knelt beside the forlorn one chafed her
hands in his own, and recalled her to life by
whispering in her ear 'the names of her hus-
bend and child.
Cecile opened her eyes at the appeal, and
looked without alarm on the face of her pro-
tector, whom she knew not. To induce her
to go with him, her preserver told her he
would conduct her to her husband. So she
arose, and leaning on the strangers s arm in
full confidence, went willingly along with
him.
On the way to the cottage, near the vil-
Itige, where the old man dwelt alone, he ga-
tliercd, from the mass of her incoherent 'dis-
course, the object of her intended~expedition
to Gazeran,. and he learnt the place where
she had deposited'Philiberte.
Having thus enticed her within his lonely
dwelling, the old man changed his tone from
gen'tlene~s to that of stern authority, for he
had powerful reasons for not taking her
either to (azeran or Brasseuse, to one or
other of Which places she implored him to
guide her. These reasons he could not 'ex-
plain/1 tc~ the unhappy Cecile, therefore he
was obliged to intimidate her into acquies-
ence with 'his wish that she should, for the
~reAent, remain with him.
Sternly' then the really kindheartedd old
man assured the poor wearied ineaniac that
she must~ not attempt to leave the house or
make 'any outcry to attract attentida, for if
she did either-never more would she see
husband'~r child.
From that moment Cecile Wa~' quiet and
resigi~ed.' '
Towards evening a peantint came to the
cottage vith a supply of" provisions' 'for' the
old man, ~vho gave him some seCret order,
Which Cecile could not hear, and soon after
the countryman went away saying,-
'It shall be done as you direct., sir.'
The messenger took tJ~e 'direction to the
forest of ilallate, and arrived at the wood-
maui'sh~t juSt after the a~ed' couple had
ipiitted it. He was sent by the 'friend of
(~cile to bring aWay the child from th'ose'in
*1te~e care the little one 'had been l'efl.
Great Was this maWs astonishment~to meet

Pieri-e, in this place, for he had known the
gamekeeper of old, but had not heard of his
return.
No sooner had the man told his errand and
where Cecile was, thaxi sure now where to
find his unhappy wife, Pierre Aubin snatch-
ed the babe from the cradle, and without
asking if the honest peasant were willing to
return without rest or refreshment-he com-
menced a rapid walk towards Vilvert, leav-
ing the man to follow at his leisure.
Thus' it was that Pierre Aubin escaped the
death prepared for him 'by the revengeful
dwarf.
To explain this we have only to mention
that the aristocrat brothers being aware that
the escaped gamekeeper could reveal their
dastardly capture and imprisonment of him,
and their murderous purpose, were most an-
xious to have him again in their power.
To this end, Antione volunteered l)i5 ser-
vices. His jealous heart suggested that the
beloved of Regina would linger in, or return
to the vicinity. He 'was repaid for his vigi-
lance by seeing Pierre (though on a different
errand t6 that which he expected might at-
tract him there) at the castle-ga.e, of Gaze-
ran, inquiring for Cecile.
How bitterly the dwarf regretted his im-
portance, alone to cope with the object of
his hatred on~whose traces he followed in
hopes of tracking him to his hiding place.
But as the wolf follows in the rear trusting
that accident may furnish an opportunity of
a~itacking atno powerful prey, unawares-so
did Antoine dodge the unconscious object,
hoping that Bdrtholomew, the faithful and
unscrupulous old servitor of the family, or
Clodomir, chief amongst the incendiaries,
might 'accidently come t~ his aid. But no
one appeared to help him, ~ai~d he saw Pierre
enter the wood-cutter's hut.
Antoin&amp; did~net' apply' for admittance, but
he~ peered thrc~1igh &amp; crevice in the rude build-
ing,. and 'listened until he was assured that
~the game-keeper intended to pass the night
there. "With ~endieh joy he overheard the
phiL o~the old~peopIe to denounce their ttn-
bidden gwest ~s'an incendiary, and he laid
his plans on the suggestions 'which it in-
spired.
It will readily be imagined, therefore, that
it' Was Antoine de~Labourallierc who pur
chased the hovt~l, meaning' to burn it; with
the uucohscioue father and child, hoping

thus to rid himself of the man whom' he fear-
ed and hated-and at' the same' time cdstihe
blame 'of the crime on the innocent Pierre,
by having hig name called out, as usual, ~t
the burning of the dwelling. tiC concluded
that the old couple, being missing,' would be
supposed to have been consumed in the
flames.
We have seen that Clodomir was taken on
'the spot with the name of his supposed ac-
complice, Pierre Aubin, on his tongue. The
~bargain had been revealed, and the same-
keeper had escaped the intended destruction.
It would seem as if the diabolical plot' was
about to recoil on the head of its projector,
and that Antoine, instead of Pierre, would be
sacrificed to the popular fury.
It is now appropriate that we revert to the
party which we left marching to Valganest,
and see how they were received, whilst Ce-
cile, her husband and child are sojourning
with their protector, to whom she shall pre-
sently refer.
It cannot be forgotten that the ocCasion of
the tumultuous excitement of the populace
of Brasseuse against the inhabitants of the
castle, and Antoine in particular, arose from
their identifying the dwarf as the purchaser
of the wood-man's hut. They were deter-
mined on sacking the house, should, he not be
delivered up to them.
As for the brothers, notwithstanding th&amp;
consternation they felt 'on discovering the
abstraction of the important coffer and the
substitution of the menacing letter-the im-
minence of the emergency restored their
courage and presence of mind. '
The angry mob'were close at hand. They
were to be seen, from the windows, fiercely
gesticulating. These men must not be ~rri-
tated by oppcsiition, they must be courteously
reo~ived, imposed on by apparent frankness,
tind the absence of all appearance of appre-
hension. This course alone would give any
chance of~ allaying suspicion and
a ~search.                      avoiding
Had it not been for the dread that the'
c/~est of mystery might still be in the castle,,
and that the cover might be raised; to seek
the missiiig Antoine in its 'dark recess, atid
reveal the skeleton remains 'of anotkeminstead I
of the living object of their search 'th
haught~r lords of Valganest Would doubtless
have dared and defied scr~thi~'
~Acting on 'this wise impuistythey gave 'di-

rectione for the gates to be thrown open to
the turbulent visitoi~s.
The three brothers then met the intruder's'
and blandly iriqul~red ,what was desired.
The peoplewere unprep~.red with a reply
suited to ~the unexpected suavity and' unco4-
cern of the brothers. 'The reasoOs they' aS-
signed for the absence of Antoine passed as
valid, and one by one all their prejudices and
convictidna vanished' for the time. The
doors having been opened withoi~t dCt~urt,
had dispelled a portion of the anger of' the
crowd, who debuting a small portion of their
number to enter, the rest remain outside, and
after the conference-they all slunk away
stammering excuses, embarrassed and ashain-
ed of their temerity and audacity.
Three weeks passed away, during which
no further manifestations of ill feeling had
been evinced towards the masters of Valga-
nest-and Antoine had not yet returned
home. It was not to be imagined that he was
inactive, but of what he was about, his brow
thers were ignorant, ~and were'anxious about
his fate, dreading also the 'clisgface to the
noble name of Labourdilli~re, should it tome
out on the trial of Olodomir, the incen4iary,
who had 'been arrested, that Antoine was one
of the principal leaders of the atrocious band.
The three weeks during which the iiit
lasted, were an age of torture, and to secnre
correct and speedy information they sejit

To the great relief of the aristocrat' brow

'And is it for the accomplishment of'this
great work that bandits, such as Clodomir,
have devoted themselves?'
No indeed, only five men in France know
the true meaning of what is doing and the
high object at which we aim. I am one of
these five! As for the instruments we em-
ploy, weak or wretched, hey obey the prompt-
ings o~ revenge or repine. If taken, so' be
it. We can find Qthers to replace the vic-
tims of the guillotine.'
As Antoine gave this explanation, the three
brothers passed from horror of the crime to
respect for the motive that scattered disaster
and destruction over France.
'Now,' continued the dwarf, who sudden..
ly appeared so great in their eyes as one of
the secret but mighty prime movers of a
great political party-' Now I have only to
speak of myself. You have' not questioned
me as to the cause of my absence.'
'That is what I was just about to do,' said
William.
Antoine deliberately emptied his glass
and gave a long narration of his late proceed-
ings, the brief summary ~f which we shall
present to our reader.
The dwarf having witnessed the capture
of Clodomir, to avoid risk to himself in case
of betrayal, had retreated to the cellars of
ilaut Mantel, where he had been securely
concealed, and had prepared a fresh plot to
gratify his party against the game-keeper of
Brasseuse-which he assured his brothers,
to their great alarm, he was pretty cem~tain
would ensure his destruction by means of the
law.
Antoine also stated that he had greatly
bettered their fortune whist thus' in hiding,
in proof of. which he produced the identical
sum, two hundred thousand francs, once prof-
fered by major Seignerolles, and rejected, by
the -old Marquis, as also subsequently by
themselves. '
To their eager queries a~ to h~w'and
where he discovered the ~treasnre, he told
them that having ventured to light a fire, one
cold i~ight on the hearth of the kitchen, of
'some oldb room handles etc., when being a  a
loss to keep it up-he took hold ~of' an old-
fashioned chair 'and broke it up to bzrn.
From a cavity in the back of this antiquated
piece of furniture the roll of bills fell out;

which he now handed over for' general use.
In their delight at this seasonable increa~
of' funds the brothers forgot their alarm about
Piem~re, but wondered how Antoine had si~
lenced Coldormr.
'Tell us quickly what you have done, and
theti we will explain much that concerns you,
said Wllliam.'
'Well, then, as Clodomir knew that I wa~
the so-called Mr. Matthien, from wj~om this
division of the band received orders, 1 had
fears that he might compromise me at~ the
trial. I therefore repaired regularly at night
to the place of rendezvous in the fore~t,~n4
at last I found a billet in the hollow elm, eu.~

maintain strict silence regarding me, proitid~

whom he had formerly loved,, but had for-
saken, and whom he now wished to secure
from indigence.

'Alas I unhappy man I' said William ;' 'yor
have lhrought us all into danger.'
'How so!!' inquired the dwarf.
They then told him of the coming of th~
mob to the castle-the visit to the closet-
the disappearance of the chest. They put
inio his hands the written threat against
them, should' they' ever' again molest their
brother, Pierre Aubin.
The paper fell from the hands of Antoine,
andhe muttered,-            '

against him was altogether fauLty, contadic-
tory and inconclusive. Some swore positive-
ly tQ his being present at fires at such time
and place; whilst others as positively; depos-
ed, that he was at some other burning, far
distant, on the same day and at the specified
hour, which conflicting evidence it was~ im-
possible to reconcile to truth.
Although Pierre would not explain where
he had been for the last two months, Mr.
Simeson credited his assertion that he was
bound to secrecy by an oath unconnected
with the incenpi~iries or their wicked doings.
Poor Cecile believed the tale that wa~
invented to pacify her shattered intellects-
that the neighbors had assembled to celebrate
Pierre's return.
Decadi se~~orded the magistrate's advice,
to Pierre, to retire from Brasseuse for awhile
to the asylum of his own residence, i, e, Mr.
Sime.ioiis, for the sake of his wife and ~hild,
but relying on his innocence Pierre resolved
to stay and face the calumny. When, how.
ever, at d irk, the house was fired, it was
time to flee, aud secretly~ by the garden
they escaped.
Quietly had they stayed in their friendly
refuge di~rhtg the trial of Clodomir, whichof
course Pierre could not suppose would effect
as he had never seen the man. Neither was
there any further notice taken of Pierre by
the people of Brrssense who were satisfied
with having destroyed his 'dwelling and got
rid of' him.
During those~ three ivee~s the game-keeder
&amp;as exempt from popular indignation, but
when the false accusation ot Clodomir, in
his last moments revived in full force the old
belief that he was one of the miscreants, he
felt that the magistrate's house would no
longer affi)rd him protection, nor could he
hope to contint~e to be secreted by him.
The intelligence of this fresh irritation of
the 1)ublic mind against, the victim of cir-
ctimstances, was brought by Decadi whp had
remained at Brasseuse, but hurried to~ warn
Pierre of the an' 'nymous advice. (aent\by the
brothers) to escape, and of Clodomir's accus-

Of course no one suspected that the crim.

of pardon, to this perjury, therefttre the dis-
closure was believed to be conscientious and
true.

for her and the dear little Philliberte.'
Decadi, who thus spoke, would gltidly have'
removed his 'cherished ones instantly from
the impending danger, but he had to s~ek a
horse and cart, and that so discreetly that no
one should suspect he was going to help
Pierre to elude justice.

Nap~deon, ' I will he at the entrance of the~

At Gazeran Castle there has been a wed-
ding, Regina has. this day given her hand to
Uonbre de Labourdilliere~ They had become
reconciled and had publicly solewuinzed. a
marriage, although each knew that love was
wanting, and they had entered into an agree-
ment mutually never to upbraid each other
in private) arid before the p~bli~ alwaysto
preserve the semblance of conjugal esteem
and affection.
Splendid had been the feast from which the
numerous guests had arisen to proceed to the
bulk-room where the nobility and gentry of the
neighborhood, and others, were assembling
fast and thick, for the joyous dance.'
Truly it was a princely sight. a noble ap-
tertairiment!
Presently the orchestra struck up'the most
enlivening sounds, the dancers took their
pIae~s, and the bride opened thehall. Frc~m
a~rece~s in one corner, Antoine, the deformed
and'gialevolent, cast invidious gl&amp;uces on the
newly married couple.
,~Tlie hilirity and excitement had reached
it#~ highest pitch, when all &amp;t once; in' the
midst of the intoxicating~ebdllitions of pleasure
a man-who certainly is not one of the in-
vited-presants himself ifl the ball-room.'
'iThis person's dress is soiled and 'dusty, his
features,.are distorted, he is pale and out of
Iur~fnh. With a bound he had sprung through
the outer enteranCe, and rushed violently past
every one until he arrived at the saloon, and
mnter;upted the dancing by widly demanding
to see the Lady of the castle.
'Fear seized on the astonished company.-
They regard the intruder with curiosity,
emotion and even with sympathy, as they
perceive the tears rolling down his, cheeks
and his knees knocking together. In his
trembling hands he holds something wrapped
up in a sheet.
Every one expects some dismal disclosure
All eyes are turned on Regina as she advan-
cesitowards the man, who is calling for 'her
with the authority derived frorti grief and
deeper tioui.
'As soon as ~Pierre Aubin, for he it Was, per~.
ceived Begina, he darted angrily forward tb
rweet'her. Casting a look on the lady, that
rooted her to~ th~ spot,' he opened the ~rheet

end held up toher view-a dead infa,~t. It
was Pidliberte!
Behold your work, madam,' shid he to'
the bride, with a hoarse, deep voice. 'It is
you who 'havekillad my child!'
Having said this, the bereaved father co-
vered the inanimate corpse with kisses and
tears.
Regin~t uttered a cry of horror, and with
her' hand pushed away the dead little one
preserfted to her; then. as she staggered
'badkwards, she stammered-
'The man is mad-turn him out!'
The spectators of this mournfully inter-
esting scene were petrified with astonishment.
A' dead silence prevailed as they contemplat-
ed the unhappy parent and the strangely-ac-
cused bride.
The three brothers alone looked elsewhere.'
Their angry regards were simultaneously
'turned upon~Antoine. Before the mute ap-
peal, th&amp; dwarf was confused, pale, and
guilty-looking.
As for the assemblage of the lofty and
high-born, it may well be supposed that they,
being ignorant of the love on one side and
aversion on the other, were unable to con-
ceive 'any grounds of accusation.
Pierre Aubin, the game-keeper, seemed by
his social position so far removed from the
beautiful and aristocratic bride, that no ac-
quaintance or 'cause of hatred could be ima-
gined to actuate her to such a crime.
The actual belief that the noble lady's
pride and self-respect would necessarily have
kept her aloof from any familiarity with a
man in his station, made them accept the few
words that had escaped her as the true ex-
planation o'f the melancholy and incredible
assertion of her guilt.
'He is mad I' she had said, in reply to the
grave charge of murder; and many believe
this to be the case.
However, in the opinion of some of the
company, Regina appeared more surprised
than indignant~ She had denied the charge,
but not with' the energy of voice and look
that might have been expected from an inno-
cent person; whilst the tone and manneY of
her ~ccusei had, the unfaltering imnpress~ of
truth and confidence.

'I shall prove what I say, Mr. Simeron.-

'Justice shall be done to every one,' was
the emphatic reply of the magistrate, who,
nevertheless, placed no faith in the shocking
intputations against the lady.
'rThanks, kind sir. After this promise, :1
am content to be taken wherever you -pl~ase.

thing. Provided the death of my child is

tthen it i deemed right to have the investiga-
ion you demand, it will take place. Mean-
while, yoLe must be taken into custody, to
render an account to society for the crimes
of which you, yourself, are accused.'
'Ah! yes; I remember! They pretend
that I am one of the incendiaries; and you,
Mr. Simeron, have come, at last, to cr~lit the
abominable calumny? Would to God that I
p'iight speak !-that I were permitted to tell
all that has befallen me!'
I And who hinders you?' asked the magis-
trate. 'Both law and conscience make it' a
sacred obligation to disclose the truth. But
would it not he the truth to confess yourself
guilty, and to say that you are overwhelmed
by the accusation of your accomplice, Clo-
domir?'
'Clotlomir? Who is he, sir? I assure
you I never heard of him until you mention-
ed the name!' said Pierre.
The truth was, that the trial at Beauvais
and its results, had not reached the ears ef
the game-keeper in his seclusion at Chamecy,
and Decadi, when warning him to escape,
had, in his hurry, said nothing about Gb-
domir.
'You inquire who Clodornir is V rejoiced
the' magistrate. 'Well, he is the man 'with
~hom you ~vent to Fleurines on 'the sixth day
of November.'
"The sixth of November?' repeated Pierre
eagerly. 'I could not have been at ~'leurinc~
on that day. This I can prove.'
- 'How ?-by what means?'
'Let me be confronted with Madame de
Gazeran I-and she shall acknowledge that I
was here-a prisoner in this very castle at
that identical time !'
must remark, that what you assert is
highly improbable.'
'Nevertheless, it is the truth. I accuse
no one. I am not breaking my o~ith! said
Pierre, looking significantly at the legitimate
sons of his father. 'I will not tell how er
by whom I was brought to Gazeran; but I
may declare that I was here, in confinement,
at that date; and I invoke the testimony of
Aladame de' Labourdilliere, since it seems
,tkat now is the name of the Lady of Gazftan.
I beseech you to consult her, Mr Sime'on. [,

who thought that Pierre had ~become corn

therefore spoke compassionately to him.-

disturbed theni hy the arrest, prepared to

The brothei~s, seeing they were about t
have Pierre Aubiti removed oat of thei,
way, and firmly entangled in the meshes o.
the law, expressed hypocriti&amp;al pity for th~
poor deluded man; and Antoin~, eager t
account for th~ murder, ventured to say,-
''~'he poor devil who accuses every body~
has, perhaps, in a fit of insane frenzy, him.
self been the death of die little innocent
whose fate ho now so pathetically bemoans.'
'Horrid wretch! Dare you say that I
could kill my own sweet Philiberte?' shouted
Pierre, trembling with rage, and with a vio-
lent effl~rt escaping from his guards, and rush~
ing towards the villainous dwarf.
At this instant, Regina, uneasy at the long
conference with the delegates of justice, ap-
peared, bedecked in bridal attire0!
CHAPTER XVI.
IT must be granted, that the victim of so
much persecution, the unfortunate game-
keeper, judgiug from the past, might well be-
lieve Regina capable of any ~ct of violence
and cruelty; yet in the present .instance he
wronged her.
This crime was committed by Antoine, al-
though it 'was not premeditated on his part.
His only object was to delay Pierre one day
longer at Chamecy, in order to secure his
arrest.
The discovery of the ehest in the 'pavilion
-sepulchre having, as already noticed, re*
moved the superstitious dread of the denun-
ciation of the paper found in the closet, re-
newed the hostile feelings of the brothers
against Pierre, whose death they now again
desired.
Antoine, who doubly hated the game-keep..
er as the beloved of Regina, was even more
desirous than Honore that this man should
perish on the scaffold as an incendiary, lie
therefore determined-to destroy the effect of
the warning that had been sent to Pierre to
escape, by stealing the child and th~rs de-
'tainiig the father in the ieighborftood., -
-It will now be understood #ho was the

under his cloak, he returned to tha lio&amp;ise,

Cecile.
It was a bold step to vanttire back wi4i
the inanimate babe, but Antoine was
turous in crime, and had faith that his eyil
genius would not' desert him. Indeed, every
thing seemed to be favorable to the s'4c~e~

courage, and 'again assured Mr. Simeron that
the man must be mad. Then casting a con-
temptuous glance on Pierre, said it was time
for her to re-join' the company in the ball-
room.
I'Iumbled, scorned, and disbelieved by
everybody, Pierre, foaming with rage and
goaded by despair, exclaimed,-
'Wo betide my wicked persecutors! Thib

pretends not to have written-this letter -
'Well, that letter 'P. interrupted the law-

cribe, would clear you, I grant; but perhaps
you will tell us it has been destroyed.'
"No, sir; no such thing. It still exists.'
'Does it?'
'Yes'; I am sure of it.'
'Why not produce it, then? or do you

dungeon, in the second dungeon to which I
was transferred. .1 put it there for safety
intending to carry it away with me if ever I
should leave t~e castle alive. But my flight
was so sudden, and attended with such hci-
dents, that, when leaving my terrible prison,
I did not think of the letter-I only thought
of preserving my life and regaining liberty.'
rI~he Messieurs de Labourdilliere had not
followed the bride, wishing to see their enemy
fairly in custody and removed from the pre-
mises; and on hearing Pierre's assertions
they looked at each other in consternation.
The worthy and humane mnagist rate, busied
with turning over in his 'mind the strar;~
charges of the game-keeper, did not observe
their troubled mien, as he replied to the
prisoner,-
'Admitting that what yoy say is true, my
poor fellow, it seems very unlikely you should-
'leave so important a paper behind you, in a
castle where, according tO your account, you
were imprisoned.' -
"It would appear quite natural, sir, if I
might tell under what circumstances I escap-
eel from mn~y dungeon; but I must not, I ought
not, I 'cannot reveal.'
Mr. Simeron, riot knowing what to think

of such contradictory statements, turned t.
Honored, and inquired, saying,-:
'What am I to make of this 'I'
'Truly, this is a pretty question to addres~
to me, sir!' was the bridegroom's sarcastic
reply. 'What must you believe respectjn~
the accusation against my wife? Has nol
every bad action' some powerful motive 01
interest to instigate its commission? Now
what motive or reason could the lofty Regina
de Gazeran have had for persecuting Pierre
Aubin, the game-keeper?'
'Besides,' added William,' if the shadow
of a doubt could exist, our sister-in-law will
doubtless consider it her duty to throw open
the interior of the castle to the examination
of the officers-of justice.'
The magistrate being satisfied, was about
to withdraw, when 'Pierre again earnestly im-
plored him td make instant search.
'Oh, sir, if you go not at once and seize
upon this precious letter, it will have disap-
peared ere to-morrow, and I shall be ruined.
I demand, in justice, to be taken at o'ce to
the subterranean dungeons of this castle. I
will show you the letter where I have told
you I buried it.'
The subterranean dungeons!' thought-
fully repeated Mr. Simeron, aloud. 'How
comes he to know that there are any such
here?'
'Pqrbleu I' sneered Antoine; 'there is
nothing strati ge about that, seeing Pierre is,
as it were, one of the household of Gazeran
-"--he was game-keeper when the old lord was
alive.'
'Yes,' added James; 'he had every op.
portuatty, as a domestic of the late lord, to
become, in the execution of his master's
orders, thoroughly acquainted with the secret
places of the castle.'
'Ah !-indeed! Then how happened it
that Madame de Labourdilliere disclaimed all
knowledge of the man?'
'Sir, do you mean to cross-questioii us?'
said William, haughtily.
'Certainly; it is my right and my duty to
do so,? was the firm rejoinder of the magis-
trate.
'It is very plain, that, in your official ca~
paucity, you are not u~ed to dealing with
honorable men,' said James, in a loud voice.
"Silenc~; you will spoil all,' whispered
Honore.
'Gentlemen,' continued Mr. Simeron, 'the

unseemly tone of your remarks, ~nd your.
very improper manner. of treating n~e haves'
induced an 'alteration of my views, and iii.'

'As you please,' said William, ~ litd~

*   'I accept your offer.'
'You will permit me to assist your in~es~
tigation ?' said Pierre, whose cotinteaaz~
was radiant with joyful hope.
'Certainly; you shall go with us to 'mdi--
cate the spot.'
Torches were instantly brought, a~d whilst
Regina, all impatience and anxiety was com-
pelling herself to act the apparently uncon-
cerned part of amiable hostess with the briiI~b
party, the bridegroom and the game.~keeper,
with the officers of justice, were descending~
deep below the festive-halls, into the gloom~r
vaults, before entering which Ilonore h~id-
contrived to send word of what was
pining to his anxious bride.
On learning that a search was actually~

The-dwarf therefore tried hard to advance

proved the strength of the obstructions above
and in front of him.

Surely now it is all over with the guilty

Not so I fly good-luck, or rather by, per-

of this stpne which overwhelmed him and
seemed to ensure destruction, was tl~e means
of providing escape.
The enormous weight of the stone urging
the body of Antoine forward, as the passage
inclined downwards, and the jar produced

choked up the inner mouth of the excava-

Notwithstanding the perilous and agonis-

wiped the clammy death-sweat of horror from
his brow-the determination of Antoine de
Labourdilliere to carry out the purpose for
which he had penetrated thus hazardously
to the late prison of Pierre, was not in the
least shaken.
Having r~cover&amp;d a little by the faint air
that entered the cell through the iron grat~

by a few short minutes of rest, he, flung him-
self on the stone floor and began eagerly to
scratch in the corner that Pierre had indi-

CII APTER XVII.
Whilst on the one han&amp;Pierre Aubin, a
prey to sorrow and despair, was being con-
ducted by the Gendarmerie, ~o the prison at
Senlis, and Antoine* de Labourdilliere was
fighting his xv~iy to the dungeon, as describe~
ed in the last ch~ipter, the ball-room in the
castle of Gizerai~ had resumed its gaiety,
the music resounded as before the embarras-
sing interruption,, and the company assembled
to celebrate the nuptials, returned with fresh
vigor and animation to the festivities of the
night.
Madame de Labourdillere having been in-
formed of the inability of the game-keeper to
find the letter, and of his departure for a jail,
recovered her self-possession, and by her
flow, of spirits, grac~, urbanity and beauty,
attracted the attention, and commanded the
admiration of her numerous and- distinguish-
ccl guests.
Notwithstanding this appearance of ease
and unconcern, Regina felt the time long
until she was at liberty to retire. -
At length the moment arrived when Re-
gina could set abou*he important undertak-
ing, on the success of which depended her
dignity, her reputation,, her honor!
With a lamp in one hand, and the keys
she required i0 the other, this bold woman
made her m'duiight-journey. through the sub-
terraneous intricacies which led to the vault
in which was concealed the imprudent avow-
al of her guilty and scandulous passion. This
tell tale paper she was about to recover, and
it. destroyed, nothing would he left to sus-
tain the blighting imputations of Pierre.'
Thus thought Regina, who knew not that
to recover, it would be requisite to ptrrchaso it
With a shudder of inward exultation she
applied the key to the lock of the secret
dungeon in which she had for so long a time
immured the- man who had despised;and re-
jected, her love. Still she hesitated an in-
stant, before opening the dood, to cast a look
hehing, in orded to ascertain . whether any
one had followed her.
It was of Honore that Regina thought;
and yet why should she dread his espio-
nage or presence? Was he not- informed

of the past? Had ~sha not' that - e~mening,
even, adm~tt~d her former love? - - - -'
This was perfectly, true, nevertheless4 Re.
gina did not wish the love-letter to fall into~t~
hands of her husband. She - intended to t9U
him in the first instance that~ she had not.
been able to find it; and to reserve to hera
self the power of using it at a future period,
according -to circumstances-either to put-
an end to the persecution of Pierre 'by Rn.
nore-or in case the former, by fresh insults
and humiliating disclosures, should drive her
to extremities, to produce this galling epis*le
as a means of causing the death of the game,
keeper through the invitation of her husband. -
Being satisfied that she, was alone ip the
corridor, Regina entered the cell aud' fI~w
towards the spot where she expected to fipd
the letter.
Instantly she recoiled with horroi,'shriel~-
ing involuntary ! - al;ne in the -~
- Regina was not             dungeon!
On the ground lay a man in convul~is.
His clothes were torn and covered with di'r~.
His lips were covered with foam, his e~s
bloodshot, and almost- starting out of their -
sockets. His contortions and apjrent, - a~., -
gony were fearful to look upon. The soPrAds
which proceeded from his mouth. were nam--
telligable, but expressive, in the greatest 4e~
gree, of fear and rage combined. - -
What could this mn'ean? Who c9uIdt~1is~
manbe? -
Notwithstandirsg her own terror, R9g$~a
drew near, and holding the light in hi~ face,
she recognized, inthis miserable object, An-.
tome de Labourdilliere! -
The wretched creature appeared to kniw
her also, .Liut his agitation was too great t~' -
allow him to express what he was Jabourij~
to say; and the astounding spectacle depr~t
ed Regina, for a few moments, of the power
of speech.
As soox~ as Antoine was able to make ar-f
~icglate - sounds, he exclaimed over' and oi~eri
again, ~in rapid succession, and a vivid ext
pression of horror-~-    -
- 'The phantom, the phantom-l It was i~1~

Yes,;he has, the~spirit!'
'The phagom, the-phantom-!' was all tl~at~

'~4Ail that the lady of Gazeran 'could make
out,, from this incoherney was-..--th'at some
stage event had very lately occurred in this
r~rriote and se~iret place, and that some mys-
te*iot~i personage had appeared to her bro-
tfier-in.isw. Without staying to puzzle 'her-
self about this strange matter, she hurried to
the corner where the letter was said to have
been, Plainly she saw that it had been'but
r&amp;~ent1y removed, the earth was fresh that
had, covered it, and appeared beyond doubt
to 'have just been scratched out.
Yes, indeed, but a few minutes 'previous,
Antoine had held it ii~ his frenzied fingers,
a~i exulted at the anticipation of his triumph
over his coveted -idol-and yet the paper
hi~d vanished, and he seemed maniac.
How this had hiippened.~-what had taken
pizice-who had parried off the missing let-
ter'~on which so much depended-remained
for the time an impenetrable mystery.
Tte~ina, in this dile~nma, was obliged to
acquaint her husband immediately with a
true statement 'of her adventure in the dun-
g~ibn, and he, with his brothers, hurried down
t~ remove the miserable dwarf, who was at
or~ce carefully escorted to Valganest.
'1*'or eigbt days and nights Antoine was in
a raging fever, and completely delirious, ta-
ving ineessently about-' the letter' and 'the
phantom!'
I~uring the whole' of this time, one or
other of the brothers, kept vigilant watch
and guard at his 'bedside. The disappear-
ani~e'of the Fetter was a constant source of
uneasiness to them, for whilst it would esta-
bhish ,the~ innocence of Pierre Aubiri, it
wbuid,' as we have seen, as effectually dis-
grace the lady who had become the wife of
oil~ of the aristocrat brotkei's, and of course
ttr6 sister-in-law-of the rest.
li was impossible for them, in the mean
time, to 'obtain any clue as the person who
had ~bstra&amp;ted the letter,' n~ light having
been thrown on the subject. by' the dw~irf
*ho could only say- ' ' '
'It was he !-It was the phantom! He
todc 'the letter!' ' ' -
liav'iizg made these exclamation~ the deli-'
rious wretch would, in his paroxisms, refer to
the'xnurder of their father, and the chest that
was ernploy~d to coneal~his remains.
- These dreadful revelations were ~f too
~ei~,u~ a' nature to be allowed to reach other
ears kiian their' owii, therefore the' brothers

took the precaution' riot to allow any one
else to enter -the sick man's chamber under
any-pretence.                 S        *
Once, and once only, had they departed
from this rule. Honor had called in a doc-
tor to see his brother!
Doctor Pascal 'ivas eminently successful
in his profession,' and was highly esteemed,
throughout a large extent of country, by
high and low, to whom he devoted his rare
skill and care indiscriminately. Thus he
waS a favorite every where, ,and did not fail
on all occasions, save one, to be well and
cordially rec4ved wherever his valuable ser-
vices were required.
The ezc.~ption, to this universal~ welcome,
occurred to Valganest, on the occasion of
his calling to pay a second visit to Antoine.
James-'who had giving his opinion, that
it was better to allow the fever to take its
course, should it even carry off their brother,
than admit any one to see him whilst thus
raving-had encountered doctor Pascal, and
refused him admittance to his patient. The
doctor insisted, an altercation ensued. From
being rude, James became absolutely inso-
lent, and ended by imperatively dismissing
him.
Immediately after, James entered the (oom
where William and Honore were sitting at
the bedside of Antoine. ~'Iis' face was still'
flushed, and the traces of his 'late anger were
visible.
'Well, James, what is the 'matter? Who
has been vexing you?' asked his elder bro-
ther, who had indistinctly heatd the sounds
of wrath.
'It was that rascally doctor, who would
come in here~wh'ether or no. in vain I tried,
bysoft words, to dissuade him, saying it was
too early-, etc. He replied that 'a doctor
mus't consult the state of his patient, and 'not
the' time 'of day. At last I lost all patience
with hirri, I had a great mind to pitch him
out of the window.'
'Gracidus Heavens l exclaimed the ever
timid Honore;-' I hope you did nothing of
th~ kind.' -
~ Miorbien, I almost regret that I did not.' -
'You would have done very wrong. I
think as you 'dothat it was a~n unwise thing
on our part to call in the' doctor, because
Antoine 'babbled worse than ever, arid there
is no knowing what suspicions it might cre-
ate, nevertheless, the doctor ought not te

have been dismissed without the greatest po.
likeness and precaution.
Thus said William-- and ftegina's husband
added-
Yes, indeed, it becomes us, above all
things, to try and raise up friends.'
A That, I think, is not our fate ' replied
James,' in proof of which, know that the ac-
cused doctor dared almost to threaten us.'
To threaten? With what? What does
he know? What ~n lie do to us? Surely
you have not compromised?'
'Why, Honore you are always a fraid,"
remarked William. ' What can signjly, the
words or actions of this Esculapius? I va-
lue them not a pin. But though I am 'not
uneasy about so trifling a matter, I should
like to know what the man threatened.'
He muttered, that 'he was driven away
from Valganest because he was attending
Cecile, the wife of Pierre Aubiii, whom he
called our victim,' said James, carelessly,
and he continued-
'.It appears, that old Decadi Robert, the
father ot' this woman, is straining every nerve
to substantiate the' innocence of his son-in-
law. Doctor Pascal also told me that this
devil of a Decadi asserts that we well know
that Pierre is not guilty, and that we could
prove it, only that the whole of us have
sworn the destruction of the gdme-keeper of
Brasseuse.'
Honored shuddered at each word, and
William, who had become uneasy, and very
attentive, asked his brother- -
'Did doctor Pascal say nothing at all a-
bout Antoine then?'
Oh yes, but I- had nearly forgotten it, for in
truth I did not pay much heed to his imper-
tinence. He said we were afraid to let him
approach the sick man on account of the re-
velations which he was making under the in-
fluencc of lever. In short, in his rage at
being turned out of doors-he called ot4,
when beyond my reach, something about
the law-that the law knew .9othirig about
nobility, or gentry, or commoners, that 'the
only distinction in i~s sight was guilt or in~'
nocence.'
'God help us, can this doctor know ?'-
exclaimed ilonore, in utter dismay.
'What can he, know, you frightened fel-
low, except flying, reports? Had he the
slightest suspicion of the truth, he would n~f
have scrupled to have cast it up to me in his

passiqn-and then gentlemen Ithink it would
have been un~Vise to have allowed him to leave
Valganest in a hurry.'
'I think, with James, that doctor Pasca1~ a,
only an echo of the family of Decadi Robert
by whom we need not expect to be held W
the order of sanctity. Any evil that the)r
may say of us can only be of little impor-
tance. Pierre Aubin, denounced as an iu.~
cendiary, has assumed the 1)ositiofl of ac~ii.
ser of Regina. Nowas Regina has become
allied to us, so long as the accusation ~'
against her remains unproved, we can not

it is in vain to talk so,' replied Honore7.
'I am not satisfied. James was too hasty.
Lie ought not to have turned out the doctor
so unceremoniously.'
'Say rather that we ought never t~ have
sent for him,'
'Then perhaps Antoine would not be 'a--
live at this time,' remarked William.
'This' may be 'true,' continued Honore,
nevertheless it would haw~ been the moat
prudent course for us to have pursued.'
£ Let us be (lone with this. Wh~t I ~li~
I do not regret,' said James, and to put an
end to the conversation, he walked out of
the sick room.
At breakfast time James re-appeared,
but he did not appear as easy and satisfied
as when he had left them. He hel~1 in hi~
hand a newspaper, folded in i~ wrapp&amp;~tl~
address on which he read, with evident sur~.

'In the name of the law I insist upon your

At this loud noise and fresh commotion,
Antoine once again raised himself up, and
catching sight of the unexpected visitor-he
pointed at him with his attenuated fingers-
and with the most sp~alling 'ook of horror,
he exclaimed-

'It is he!' l7hepharztom!'
As the dwarf pronounced these words, he
fell backwasds, gave a last groan, and ex-,
pired!!
'Walking up to the bed', 'the new-coriier
took hold of the hand of the corpse,' and
pressing it with emotion, exclaimed-
'My son! OIimyson!'
Then turning ~to the bewildered specia.
tors of the extraordinary scene, this person
thus 'addressed them-.
'Gentlemen, I have learned that my sons
were accused for Parricide-therefore am I
here. .0ehold 'me I-Recognise me !-I am
Major Seignerolles-or, rather, lam Etien~c
de Labourdillere!'
CHAPI'ER XIX.
As there could be no doubt ~f the existencs~
or identity of Major Seignerolles, the magis.~
trate and his suite soon took their departure.
There, in the chamber of the cltty~.coM
dwarf, the brothers stood, self-condemned
and utterly humiliated!
The father's heart had compassion, 'even
for his wicked children, whom h~ m9utned
with bitter sorrow-and for a'time all Were
silent.
Through the opportune appearance of tiv~
Major, that is, Etienne de Labourdillere, his
sons were preserved from public punishnient,
-but not from the disgrace of having l*e-
meditated the crime, which the dying wtn~ds
of Anoine proved his belief had been
treated.                  '        prp
Pierre Aubin was cleared from the 'stigma
that had been attached to his name, andthe
danger that menaced his life, when it Was
ascertained wher0 he had passed his tinie
during the absence whiQh it had been sup-
posed Was spent amongst the incediaries-~--
not in the dungeon-vaults of Gazeran Castle.
But, he too, wus in trouble, on account of
his child's death, and his wife's impaif~d
health and reason.
Decade, however, the old soldier, and lie
alone, seemed tofeel pleasuraNe feelings on
the occasion. He was unteignedly glad~ i~
find that his old commander, the Major, was
still 'alive.
Etienne de Labourdilliere then gave a ~-
lution of the mystery 'of his escape frotwthe
death they believed F'tancoi~ had infli~ted,
and to this, all 1istene~d with attention. '
'Ma foi,' said' the old soldier, we'behieY~'d


I~G11~A.

that you had repented ofyour resi~lve to. ac~
linoi#i4edge Pierre, and had abscouded to get
eleuir ofus!' ' '
'You wronged me Decadi, and this my fu.
sure actions will declare better~ than words-
but my sons 1 see are anxious to. learn how
it comes that' I am luckily alive to save theta
;not onI~y from condiga punishment, but, I
Would fain hope, from the~pangs of remorse.'
You speak truly, father!' said Honore, ti-
midly. 'Indeed we have known no peace
8mce that dreadful hour, when our brother
Francois re~appear~d from your chamber,
wounded and bleeding-with, as we believ-
ed~ your blood on his hands, and your death
on all our guilty consciences.
Honor paused, and shuddered at the re-
collection; and William added-
~ We heard a fearful struggle, too, as it
Rpppared.'
'I will relate what occurred,' said Etienne
* de Labourdilliere-
' When Francois entered my apartment,
(saw from his livid look, and the desperate
exression ot~his countenance, that his pcir-
r.pose wasto put an end. to my existence,
wl~ich I knew, my sons unhappily considered
a burthen to them. I saw also that he was
~s~ot altogether so hardened as to have no
~ornpunotions about the dreadful deedhe had
4ndertaken to perform, and resolving to
8pare him the certain remorse that would as-
j~uredly follow and avenge such a crime, I
said-
'Beware! I am armed! Approach not a
step nearer at your peril I'
'Disregarding my warning, Francois rush-
e$ upon me, and the dagger which I' had
drawn to protect myself,~and deter him, un-
mte~nipnally wounded him. I threw the wea.~
pon from me, and grappled with my adver-
sary, determined, it' possible, to overpower,
a$ then. force him to listen to wy plan for
his salvation.
.i This 1 managed to effect, and easily, for
my arms were ~erved with the courage of
section and a good pu~pose~-whilst his
were enfeebled by the wickedness of his ob-
ject.
When I had mastered and pinioned my
unhappy son, 1 implored him to listen to me.
~ assured him, that notwithstanding this out-
rage, he was too dear for me t&amp; h~rm, and I
placed his conduct in such a light as drew
tears from the eyes~ of both of us.

"What shall J do t6 make atonement for
thjs~ sin, oh my father,~ said he, penitentially.
You must allow your brothers to believe
that you accomplished your mission. To
keep up this appearance, we will bring out
that chest, which you can privately fill with
stones, at your leisure, and you will persuade
them that you have put my mangled corpse
into it, as you doubtless intended.'
,'The horn which your brother were
sounding down stairs, in order, I suppose, to
drown my cries, and which fortunately hin-
dered their hearing your appeal to them for
aid-has ceased, we will therefore make a
noise, as if scuffling, which will account for
your sound.
Obey m~,'I continued, and I will be as
though dead/to you all in future, as much so
as if I really were an inanimate occupant of
that chest, whose very sight, I prophesy, will
be torture to your brothers. Never shall I
re-appear unless to save or serve! On these
terms he went. down unstained by a father's
blood.
Alas! it is too true-but I forgive him,
and Pierre also will pardon him, I am sure.'
~Antoine is gope to render his final ac-
count,' said William, solemnly, ' Let us not
judge the departed. As for me, I will hide
my shame within a cloister's walls! To-mor.
row I will take refuge from poverty and con-
tempt in the solitude of the great Cliatreuse
of Grenoble.'
'I will accompany you wherever you go,
said James, ' we4inave never yet been sepa-
rated, and I am sick of a world where every
thing is t~mrned topsy turvy. There will be
none but upstarts in high places soon, I ama
weary of this miserable state of things, .1 will,
with you, withdraw from the world.'
Having thus given vent to his spleen, James
inquired of his brother Honore what he
meant to do?
'Valganest is no place for ~me,' he replied,
'I am no longer it~ lord-I will at once leave
it, and give place to the present Marquis,
Etienne-Ae Labourdilliere, whose rank and
title none can dispute.'
Whither will you turni your steps?'
I must, without delay, hie to Gazeran, to
break 'this, intellig~hce to Regina, and consult
with her about our fttttmre mov~nicnts. You
know that being married, I am n~t fr~e to act
so independently, as you, brother~4' he a~ded,
noticing their looks of surprise.

A surely you will not live with her after the
public are aware of her prior, love and in~
trigues?'
~It is rather embarrassing and unpleasat~t,
but' doubtless some means may ~e found to
hush up the matter and 'avoid scandal. My
wife is rich, young, noble 4n4 beautiful; we
may make some kind of a compromise; for I
am almost entirely dependent on her.'
Having thus explained his views, Honore
ordered his horse, add taking leave o~' his
forgiving parent with more cordiality and
good feeling than he had ever before express-
ed or felt, he left the castle of his ancestors
for ever.
On arriving at Gazeran, he found that Re
gina had fled from thence on the day follow
ing the announcement of the newspaper Cod-
cerning the discovery of the fatal letter.
It appeared that she had hurried to Paris,.
settled her afThirs with the utmost dispatch,
and with a large amount in cash an~d jewels,
had proceeded to a seaport, whence she em-
barked on board a vessel bound for the
Brazils.
All this the determined spirit of the woman
had infected, while the brothers were supinely
watching the progress of events, py the bed
side of th~ir conscience-stricken brother.
Regina left a letter for ~her husband, in
which she stated her reasons for taking the
step of expatriating herself without consulting
him Thus 'she skilfully avoided the un-
pleasant sce~ws which she well knew would
be inevitable if she remains. The letter
concluded in these words,-
"It' you really love me, Honore, and choose
to follow as soon as your affairs in France
can be arranged-I promise, sacredly, you
shall. htve no reason to regret having made
Regina do Gazeran your wife, if the most
complete devotion and the strictest constancy
with 'a never failing desire to please on my
part can secure your happiness.'
Honor did not hesitate. He had no
longer any estate to embarrass his move~
ments, and but little property of any kind.
He sailed-but the vessel did not reach its
destination and he was never more heard
of!
The other brothers put their intentions into
practise, but, ore their noviciate concluded,
a contagions fever, sweeping with destructive
fury through the cloistered cells, assailed life;
without allowing preparation for death, and

speedily tI~ey were no more.
None but Etienne de Labourdi1lier~, thJ
aggrieved father, and Pierre Aubin, the di*~ 2
owned~ and persecuted brother, were round
to regret the extinction of tke~ aristni*~r~
brothers.'
But little now remains to relate, thQugh
that little can not well remain untohi.

turn from the date of his acquittal, an~l he
was looked upon as a noble martyr 'to p~rse.'

ance and hpnor, in thathe had not betr~.yed
those who had so shamefully ill-treated him.
It may readily be surmised, by the reader,
who was the (to her unkno~vn) protector of
Cecile-and why Pierre was so delighted'to
see that old man on the nigljtt of his es4ape
i'rom the woodman's burning hut.
In Vilvert, had the supposed victim ~f
par~'icides, remained in seclusion, watchitig
over the lives of his children. He had. ob-
tamed a promise from Pierre, not to prosef~ute
or accuse the aristoc~i'at brothers, when he
received him on his escape from G~zera~i
dungeons.
This sacred promise it was that caused the
giiine-keeper, to endure the suspicion~ ~and
calumny-of his neighbors, without making
known the truth, which would have 6xeu~*
ed him.
When, at length, Pierre Aubin was s&amp;t
free, in virtue of the alibi which Regina's let-
ter established-.~-he found Cecile at her fathers
(for his house had been burnt down by the
indignant peasantry) a prey to grief, sickness,
aa4 delirium, and under the care of D0ct4*~'
Pascal.
Qa the first visit which The Doctor paid,
subsequent to his ignominious expulsion 'fr~om
Valganest, he detailed the treatment he;~ha~d
received at the hands of James de Lahour-
pilliere, and related the terrible ravings ~ff
An~ine, which' confirmed the suspicions 'f
old Decadi Robert that the Major Seignerolle~'
had mpt with foul play.

5~f 1~tenne, th~o4ackn owledged Maxquis
de Lab~,urdiIliere, had left him to his solitary
grarideur the gamr~-keeper was heartily
welcomed by the old man.
'i'he Marquis resolved, without delay, to
set about making atonement to his long-neg-
lected son, and to the exemplary mother of
thai son.
TQ this end, he made use of his recovered
titl~T and consequence to obtain a decree 'le-
~git~mating that son, Pierre Aubin; and he
determined to marry the unfortunate mother,
for which purpose h~ journeyed to Paris.'
,Thisobj~ct was not so easil~1 attained as
he had expected. It took the iu~ited entrea-
ties ~of Decadi 'and Pierre~ besides his own,
to induce Euphrosine to accept the tardy act
;of justice, which would. render herthe sharer
o~ hjs name and rank!
'lThwever, Euphrosine did consent that the
~e~rnony should be performed, which made
hem' Marchioness de Labourdilliere! She,
who had toiled, with her needle, for years,
W give, bread to her son!
Once, mid for a long time, Euphrosine had
patiently looked forward with delight tb the
nuptial day; but it came so late, it found her
~ahiv~mnd sad. The romance of feeling was
ov'ei~Z~the 'romance of reality -was taking
pI~ce! She was at once raised from mdi-
gemice to ~vealth--from insignificance to a
lofty position.
'This marriage also restored her tG'h~r
soh's society, and that of her brother Decad i,
-1'or which she was truly gr~teful. Ere long,
'her tender care and judicious nursing, ~lded

Thei~', al~6~th~' party remained for a consi-
derable time, as it was resolved that until
Pid~re Aubixvcould be received at Valgnnest
as .th'e'legitimate heir of its lord, he should
not enter-the halls of his ancestors.
This delay was profitably spent by the happy
family, the newly 'adopted members of which
were gradually prepared by the eccentric but
accomplished Etienne, to lake their. places
creditably among' the magnates of the country.
The game-keeper of the forest of Bras-
seuse and his dear Cecile, furnished occasion
for another christening festival, which was
celebrated on a grander scale than that with
which our story commenced, but which we
will forbear to describe; suffice it to say, that
the whole country participated in the joyful
fete, at which Pierre Aubin appeared no
longer as the game-keeper, but as the heir to
the property of his brother, now no more.
The republican bias of the nobility, even,
as well as the other classes of society, caused
'this triumph, of the- plebian-mother and son,
to be looked on with complacency.
The rejoicings on the return of Etienne'
with his f~a~riily to take possession of Valga-
nest, with the christening of the grandson Qf
the Marquis de Labourdilliere, were univer-
sal and sincere; for few, if any, regretted
t*he change of masters which had taken place.
Etienne, known and esteerried formerly as
Major Seignerolles, passed his last years
happily, in carrying out his republican prin-
ciples, in ame~orating the condition of his
tenantry, and in the quiet domestic' circle he
had wisely gathered about him.
Decade Robert and he, used, together, to
talk over their old campaigns and the glories
of the consular days, and amuse themselves
with the grandchildren successively present-
ed~to them by the faithful and ever-loving
couple, 4?ierre and Cecile.
Rventr~ally, on the death of Regina,
Gazeren Castle' and estates came into the
possession of Pierre as the lawful heir.
Thus was the game-keeper rewarded for
his constancy to Cecile, and uis generosity to
the unworthy aristocratbrotkers, by a' very
unusual share of prospehty and happiness.
