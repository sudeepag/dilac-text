THE Author is compelled to ask a gentle judgment from the readers of Rose Milton, in consequence of its - numerous typographical errors; such, for instance, as calling Richard I., William Coeur de Lion, and the fre- quent substitution of common words for proper names. The time has gone by when a writer, like old Ramsay, could tell his readers that-" in the meantime william henry lyttleton being appointed governor of Jamaica, the charge of carolina devolved on william bull."* But it is due to the publishers to state, that they had a most impracticable chirography to overcome; and that, whilst the work was passing through the press at Philadelphia, the author was reposing amid the mag- nolia groves of the sunny South. * See Military History of South Carolina, 1670-1776. AUGUST, 1855.     PREFACE. IT may be necessary to say one word in reference to the following romance, as it is one of real life, and paints, the manners of O society the most opulent and refined in our country. The good and the evil of such a society are apparent to the most casual observer;, for who can fail to perceive, that where wealth elevates young men above the necessity of labor, they will in- evitably fall into habits of dissipation, and that the vile practice of duelling, which has prostrated so many families in the dust, and blighted the prospects of so many young men, who might have adorned society, and lent lustre to the young republic, will pervade, pervert, and prostrate the whole social system? It was to portray these evils that I wrote the romance of Rose Milton, and to present the picture in its real colors, I was compelled to introduce one or two cha- racters, whose integrity and celebrity have won for them a position which is imperishable in the annals of the South. But I have not trenched on their reserved rights. They have been represented in a way that   viii          PREFACE. does them no dishonor; and with these brief remarks, I close this preface, trusting to public opinion for my justification, and bidding my gentle readers adieu, for the present, in the words of Sir Walter Scott, To all, to each a fair good night; And rosy dreams, and slumbers light. THE AUTHOR. June 28, 1865.   ROSE MLTON. CHAPTER I. TWELVE months had elapsed since the grand ball at General Sherbrook's,* and in those twelve months what changes had taken place! Florence Craven, Flora Sherbrook, Bruce Mel- rose, and Berkeley, the brother of Florence, had been swept down from the sweet scenes of celibacy, and were engulfed by the gloomy waves of matrimony.- Meeta, the sister of Bruce, had turned poet, and was fast eclipsing Felicia Hemans;. and poor Jack Rattle! who had galvanized the thin gentleman, that looked like an empty vinegar cruet trying to replenish itself with a sunbeam-poor Jack Rattle had " fallen asleep." But the scene shifts from Rosamond. It was near the close of evening when I arrived at the Stag, in Afton. My servant having preceded me, I found my rooms in order, and shortly after tea and toast I was delighted to greet my old landlord, Angus Scott. He apologized for his intrusion, giving as reasons his desire to welcome my arrival, and to deliver a communication from young Plantagenet, both of which achievements he accomplished to our mutual satis- faction. But, as he was a character in his way, I shall describe him before deciphering the letter. Angus Scott was, at the time to which I refer, about five-and-forty years old, but in good preservation, except his hair, which was of a sable sil- * Memoirs of Henry Lexington-unpublished. 2   10         ROSE MLTON: vered. In person he was thick and short, his utmost height being about four feet four inches; and his rotundity--his girth being great-was not less than five feet, so that he might have rolled as well as walked, without detriment to his physical con- stitution. But his rotundity was a part of his system, for his head was round, his eyes were round, his nose was round, his mouth was round, his chin was round, his face was round, and his voice rolled out with a rotundity that was beautifully broken by the Scots' brogue. It is true that his nose, mouth, and chin were round, but then they turned up, and if it had not been for his large firm feet, he might have turned over in a somerset backward, like little Master Willet, the famous circus rider. But his feet kept him down, and preserved his centre of gravity from the vaulting ambition that throws so many men " on the other side." But for a publican, he was exceed- ingly generous and indugent, keeping a capital table, and gratifying every wish of a guest, if he was able to " foot the bill ;" but woe to the unlucky wight whose consumptive purse denoted a broken fortune! A galloping consumption would be slow travelling to the exodus of that witless wight from the dominions of the Stag. Not that Angus Scott had a hard heart; not that he was imperious by nature; but, if he was true to himself, it must follow, "as the night the day, he could not then be false to any man." Such was Angus Scott, the most popular publican in Afton. Of his fondness for trotting horses, sherry wine, turtle steaks, and terrier dogs, I shall speak elsewhere; but for the present the current of this his- tory flows among "the green braes" of sweet Afton. I have mentioned that Scott brought me a letter from young Plantagenet. At a glance I perceived that his nervous system was suffering from some indiscretion, and, dismissing the rotund publican, I hastily broke open the letter, and read as follows:- "I anticipate your arrival in the city," so the letter began; "and therefore request that you will drop in, and 'snap fingers' with me at once, or, if delayed by press of business,   A ROMANCE.            " - that you will assist me in 'slaughtering' the first evening that 'turns up.' I have a world to tell you-not now, but when I can collect my senses, which have been running about at ran- dom these ten days; but you must be secret, for, if my con- dition transpires, and Fanny hears of it, I shall be a banished man. I have been making love to her more than a month, but for the life of me I can't find out what she thinks, or, indeed, if she thinks at all about me; she is so circumspect, for fear of that detestable Augusta Beresford, who is always prying into other people's business, and not neglecting her own, if there be a rich 'single gentleman' looming above the hori- zon of her hopes. What do you think she told Maria Gadsden the other day about me? Why that, when taking a gallop with her, she said, 'Oh dear! I can't breathe;' and that I replied, ' Don't try, Miss Augusta.' Now, I declare no such dialogue took place; that is, as she reported it. But then, you know, Lexington, what women are. Why, even Maria Gadsden, who is a bird of the same feather, was taken in, and reproached me for my cruelty to the fair sex. Poor thing! men are always cruel to them-the innocents. I wonder that they should talk so about me, who have been their victim since I first made the rhyme of ' lady and baby.' Do you remember Hortensia Wayne? She was the first; as to the second--but never mind the second now, for, if I can only escape the perils that environ me, I shall give up the sex, for who would think of love after one's twenty? . But I have said enough to let you know that I don't know where I am, or what I am about, except that I am yours-as witness my hand and seal." This letter was signed, in great large characters, Richard Plantagenet. Indeed, I should have known its author, even had there been no signature to the letter; bet for which Fanny was he now "suffering love?" Was it Fanny Gaillard, or Fanny, the sister of Aubrey Beauclerk? But here a sudden thought flashed upon me. It must be Fanny Freemantle, 'the friend of my sweet sister, Hortense. The moment her name   12        ROSE MLTON: occurred to me, I perceived the danger of Plantagenet's posi- tion, and determined to go at once to his residence in Legare Street, and confer with him on the subject of his grievance. The evening being cold, I dressed myself in cap and cloak, and walked to his house; but, to my surprise, he was absent, having, as his servant said, gone out about an hour previously. I returned, but, on turning the corner of Tradd, I encountered a gentleman, cloaked like myself, and walking rapidly. He did not look up, but, keeping his eye on the ground, continued his rapid walk, until arrested by my voice, and turning, we recognized each other by the light of the lamp. We returned to his house. Plantagenet placed his chair close to mine, in front of the fire, and said-But before stating what he said, I must give you a description of this son of "the sweet south, that breathed against a bank of violets"- for he was ever up to the eyes in love. Richard Plantagenet was just twenty-one years old, hand- some in form and features, highly accomplished for one of his age, gentle- in his manners, brave as a lion, but so irresolute, so impetuous, and yet so loving, so inconstant in his conduct towards women, that he was either up to the ears in scalding water, or reposing on a bed of roses like a luxurious Sybarite. His manners were indescribable-for who can describe that which is indescribable? But whatever made their charm, gen- tleness and manly delicacy constituted their essence. His person was above the medium height, well made, active, and elegant; but his face had a particular fascination in its smile, which was really lovely, and seemed to add a certain lustre to the full gray eye that would look into your own, in his moments of abstraction, as if his soul was seeking for some hidden treasure, oPthe realization of a cherished dream. The nose, mouth, chin, and brow were instinct with nobleness and intellectual vivacity, and even without the aid of'his forehead -for he commonly wore his hair brushed negligently over it- would have singled him out as a being destined to play no   A ROMANCE.           13  insignificant part on the public theatre, but what that part would be, no one could determine from the fascinating fervor of his features. "Lexington," said he, "I wished to see you, and obtain your advice in a piece of business that is killing me." "I hope your case is not so bad." "Yes, it is," he continued; "don't you see how I'm wasted away? My physician has advised me to try Madeira." "O, the Madeira, of all things," said I; "it is an enemy to colds, and on such a night as-this a glass of it would make one as poetical as Lorenzo and Jessica in the 'Merchant of Venice.'" "If I could only escape into poetry," said he, sighing, "I should be the happiest man in the world; but it is the infernal prose that breaks my Pegasus at the knees. But we'll try the wine, in any event. I wonder how I came to forget it. But you see how distracted I am." With a ludicrous expression of mischief, he paused and pulled the bell, as if it had been the last night of December, instead of the first of that month. The Black Prince-for so he called his servant-made his entr&, and receiving orders to -bring in "the island of Madeira," we wre soon engaged in discussing its vintage, and discoursing at large of things in general, for there is nothing in heaven or earth, or under the earth, like wine, to brighten the brain, or touch the tongue with "rattling and audacious eloquence." "What I wish to say to you is this." Here he paused, and after looking into the fire thoughtfully, rose up, and placing his hands behind him, paced up and down the room, as if debating with himself. "What I wish to say to you is this-that I am in an awful predicament." "Well, you told me that already; but what is the predica- ment that annoys you so much? State your position, and well. try and solve the riddle." 2t'   "        ROSE MLTON: "You must know," continued Plantagenet, " that I am in love." ("That's natural enough to one of your temperament," said I; " but who is the fair Calypso that has entangled you?" "O, the loveliest girl you ever beheld-the sweetest crea- ture in all the world!"Here he paused again, and recom- menced his promenade.  "Lexington," said he, "I may confide in you, for, if I am not mistaken, you are paying your addresses in another quarter. Now listen to me. I love Fanny Walsingham as never man loved woman." "Fanny who.?" said I, in astonishment, for, to my certain knowledge, he had been "sighing like furnace" to a Fanny of a different name. "You seem to be astonished, and I acknowledge that you have some grounds for your amazement. But when you saw me last, I had not encountered Fanny Walsingham. I will tell you," continued he, pausing, and looking me full in the face. "I met her at Talbot Shrewsbury's-last w'eek, and as there was a misunderstanding between a certain young lady and myself, I determined to excite her jealousy by a little flirtation with Fanny Walsingham, but she received my atten- tions with so much coldness that I was piqued, mortified to the quick. But, having commenced the game, I was loth to give up the pursuit, and -mustering all my assurance for a grand assault, I asked her tQ dance. If she declined, I was dead; but if she consented, my point was gained, as in affairs of love the first step is half the battle." "In a dance?" said I. "The first step- in a dance, or in diplomacy, is that which makes or mars our fortune. You comprehend my position? Well, she consented, with the most condescending simplicity, and, the most bewitching modesty, that you can imagine. We danced, and I was transported with her affability, with her wit, her worth, and, in a word, she fascinated me to such a degree that I forgot all about my former love. I had found the angel   A ROMANCE.           15 that was to lead me to Paradise, and I poured into her ear the 'thoughts that breathe, and words that burn,' for when did eloquence desert a lover? Even a word, a look, a sigh, speaks a thousand volumes, and every volume is a book of beauty. You smile. But words are things, and of all things the words of one that loves are the most powerful, when poured into the heart of those whose life is love." "You describe your love so eloquently," said I, "that 'Cupid must have clapped you on the shoulder.'" Ah," said Plantagenet, witl a sigh, "you give me cold comfort." "Cold or hot, comfort is something to a lover," said I, "but I am in the dark as much as ever. What is your present position with the lovely Fanny?" "I am coming to that. Don't you surmise?  You shake your head. Well, I thought you better versed in the ways of women. But you shall hear, and then judge whether I have not sufficient cause to drown myself. We danced, talked, walked; and the moment she resumed her seat, that moment she resumed her cold demeanor, and to all my remarks she replied 'no,' or 'yes,' with her sweet lips, as if a simple assent or dissent was food enough at one time to satisfy my burning appetite. And will you believe it possible? When I asked her to dance a second time, she declined, without giving any reason whatever, merely requesting that I would excuse her I But her looks spoke more than her words. There was a certain something in her air, when declining, that was indescribable- a haughty courtesy, mingled with gentleness and simplicity- that left me no alternative but submission for a time. I say for a time, because, subsequently; and on three other occasions since the meeting at Shrewsbury, I pursued the same conduct, and with precisely similar results. Now, Lexington, that girl loves me! but what am I to do? What course am I to pur- sue? I have exhausted my ingenuity-what's your remedy?" It was evident to me that Plantagenet had overstepped his   16         ROSE MLTON: mark. In the vehemence of his passion, he forgot that pru- dence was the touchstone of all human affairs, and in nothing that concerns us poor mortals is prudence so requisite as in affairs of love. There is pride even in love--a defensive pride, that guards a noble woman from becoming the prey of the man she loves. And it was eviden't to me that the fair young creature who had charmed my friend-whether, she loved or no--was acting with the delicacy that became her beautiful sex. But, then, why was this affair confided to me? What part did Plantagenet wish me to perform in a play where he was the chief actor? To be his Mentor would be hazardous, for I was scarcely older than himself; and I told him candidly that, in this business, he resembled the steed of the king of old, and needed the bit more than the spur. But the com- parison did not flatter his pride, and I perceived that he was anxious to engage me as his attorney--to plead his cause, and represent him at the court of love! In this,-however, he was mistaken, for I flatly refused to interfere, suggesting the pro- priety of his taking the field again, like a brave soldier, for love is warlike. Without assenting, he took his seat at the table, and filling a glass, challenged me to "wine with him." The conversation now took a different direction, and when we parted, it was with a promise to meet again on the next eve- ning at the Honorable Mr. Lansdowne's, to whose grand ball we had special invitations. CHAPTER II. I EMPLOYED the intervening period in reading poetry and politics, and attending the courts of justice.; and here, before proceeding with the current of this history, Ishall pause to re- late an anecdote that occurred on a certain occasion, when I was present, in one of the courts of common pleas. In a cause   A ROMANCE.            17 of some personal interest, a lawyer of distinguished attainments frequently asked the question, " dui bono? cui bono?" when his antagonist, who, by the way, was named -Dominic Hall, rose, and bowing respectfully to Judge Bay, remarked "that it was necessary to place himself right before the court, inasmuch as his client was not named Cui Bono, but Sims Bonneau." The scene that ensued defies description; judge and jury, the bar and bench, being convulsed with laughter. Nor was the learned judge himself deficient in humor, for, on another occasion, a young attorney asked for a common-the legalbrief of the word commission-to examine witnesses. "A common to examine witnesses?" inquired Judge Bay. "Yes, may it please the court," replied young Coke. "Are your witnesses numerous?" asked the judge. "Yes, may it please the court." "Why, then," said the judge, " as your witnesses are nume- rous, and you wish a common to examine them, you are at liberty to take Harleston's green i" But we must now hasten to the party at Lansdowne's. That gentleman, as his name indicates, was of a distinguished English family, and he retained in his manners, tone, and style the elegance, and occasionally the ostentation, peculiar to the-aris- tocracy of the fatherland. As he was a large landed proprietor, he could easily retain his supremacy; for, in the social system of Afton, the commercial and mechanical interests are entirely subordinate to the Agricultural. His position being recognized, he could without censure display the pride of wealth in its scorn of everything tainted with democracy; for, in his opinion, man- kind generally, and his-poor neighbors particularly, were merely the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the noble, the generous, the wealthy men of the soil. Indued with these sentiments from his youth, and impressed with them by the evidences of subserviency which he witnessed daily and hourly in his intercourse with the cringing cowards "who bawl for freedom in their savage mood," he did not hesitate to assume   18         ROSE MLTON:        ' the imperious tone, temper, and bearing of. a tyrant in his in- tercourse with the common people, as he contemptuously termed his countrymen. Neither could he "bear a brother near the throne," as his inveterate hatred of the Pringle Balls-not the cannon Balls, who built the famous Cannon's bridge-bears ample testimony. - To ape the manners, the customs, and affect the prejudices and peculiarities of the London oligarchy, in a land where simplicity is the chief ingredient of greatness, was in his opinion merely keeping up the respectability of his descent from the old conquerors who followed "Billy's banners," and insuring him against the fire of those levelling principles which would burn up his barns, that the people might warm their hands at the blaze. It is true that he was born in Ame- rica, but then it was much against his will-or would have been, had he been consulted-and to judge by the names of his plan- tations, and children, and horses, one would imagine that, in revenge for his birth, he was determined to obliterate his exist- ence as a freeman by surrounding himself with the forms of royalty, forgetting that in this he did violence to the' public opinion, and rendered himself obnoxious to the noble sentiment of Lord Bacon, "that the sum of behavior is to retain a man's own dignity without intruding upon the liberty of others." Such was Henry Petty Lansdowne, the proudest aristocrat of Afton, and as such I single him from the throng that sur- rounded him on my arrival at his house. But, as we naturally desire to know something of the personal appearance of those who 'are noted for some peculiarities of habits, manners, or opinion, I shall pause for a moment to touch him with my pen. He was about forty years old, tall and stout, with what some one calls " a family air ;" that is, he looked like a man who had a wife and children. But, when among his own sex, his bearing was extremely proud, formal, and imperious, as if- he had stereotyped, and set apart in one of the recesses of his brain, the emphatic line of the famous old ballad- "I am monarch of all I survey."   A ROMANCE.            19 - His face was thin, pale, and handsome, his eyes black and glancing, his chin and mouth really beautiful, if I may apply such a term to a man. But it was his hands that indicated the gentleness of his birth; they were so small and so fidelyrounded that one recalled the remarks made by BEtsy Balcomb to Na- poleon: "Your hands are so small that I wonder how you can wield a sword!" He stood in the centre of the room when I entered; his wife was leaning on his arm, replying graciously to some inquiry by one of her sycophants, for she too had her little court and maids of honor, being cousin-german-so the rumor went-to the Queen of England. There was a movement, then quite a sen- sation, which was accounted for by the appearance of the young Lansdownes; the first being a cherished rose leaf, named Vic- toria Adelaide Mary Louisa, named after her cousin, the prin- cess royal; then came Albert Edward, a boy in curls; then followed Alice Maria Mary, and Alfred Ernest Albert, arm in arm  next came Helena Augusta Victoria, and Louisa Caro- lina Alberta, as like and lovely as two roses; and lastly, marching " alone with his glory," like Sir John Moore, at Co- runna, came the youngest of the Lansdownes, Master Arthur Patrick William Albert, the hope and glory of their line:- "Heaven send it happy dew!" I had scarcely surveyed the scene around me, when, feeling the top of a fan on my arm, I turned and recognized Grace Chatterton, the liveliest and most talkative little creature in creation. The encounter was lucky, for there are times when one, however impulsive and spirited, would prefer a little gossip with a girl in a corner to all the sentimental nonsense in the world. Nay, the great majority of persons present were per- fect strangers to me; and, Grace being a guest everywhere; I knew she must be acquainted with every character of any con- sequence or notoriety in the room. I therefore took her to a seat from which we could observe all that was passing, the   20         ROSE MLTON: dancing-for we deem it plebeian to dance before midnight- the flirting, the assumed consequence, and the numberless in- gredients which constitute a ball in high life--high indeed, since its actors seldom come down to common sense. "Ah, Mr. Lexington," said the lively Grace, "where have you been? I have not seen you for a month, and began to think that you had vanished like the ghost in Hamlet. You have missed a world of amusements, for what with routs and races, we have had a rapid time." "You know, Miss Chatterton, that although I am not 'Young Rapid,' yet I 'keep moving,' for I have my landed interest to look after." "Pray, how do you continue to amuse yourself in the coun- try? It must be so dull up there alone, with nothing --- "But myself, you would say; but I assure you that there are times when I feel 'never less alone than when alone,' particu- larly when I am alone with you." "Bravo! you have a turn for fine sentiments, but pray don't let us be sentimental, 'tis not the fashion; so let us drop the Ro- mans, and stick to the moderns. We who enjoy life know the value of company, and you should have seen the company that was assembled at the fancy ball on Friday. Why, there was Cor- nelia Cornwallis, in a white gossamer, having three skirts edged with pale blue, bespangled with silver; a crown of stars, 'ever trembling and incessant' on her head, and a snowy veil half concealing and half disclosing her lovely face."' "Perhaps she took the veil as a choice of evils?" "O, she is a sweet girl! Buit your friend, Bay Middleton, was the observed of all observers, being equipped in a suit of blue velvet, trimmed with silver lace; sleeves open with scarlet silk let in, and lace ruffles; pants slit at the sides, and looped with scarlet ribbons, with lace frills below the knee; light slippers, with rosettes; short cloak of blue velvet, lined with scarlet silk, and a black cavalier cap, with a single white plume. Don't you think his toilette was in excellent taste?"   A ROMANCE.          -21 "I do indeed, if the man was a woman who wished to adver- tise herself in propria persona, as the Mock Duke says in the Honeymoon. But, pray tell me, who is that lady in the plain white dress and auburn tresses? She seems to be sim- plicity itself." "That lady is Charlotte Surry, and the deepest blue! Don't you know her? Why, she rises before the sun to read Spenser, and all the other poets, Byron, Milton, Moore; and then she is such a scholar! Oh, it is said that she understands Greek and Latin; and as for German, she reads Goethe's Faust and Wil- helm Meister, in the original. There is no knowing how much that little head of hers contains. I saw her pulverize Henry Vane, that insufferable coxcomb, the other day, by asking him the meaning of some Latin sentence. ' Excuse me, Miss Char- lotte,' quoth he, ' for I don't understand dog Latin.' 'It is trulywonderful,' replied Miss Surry, ' that puppies don't under- stand their own language.' Don't you think she was severe?" "Not too severe when addressed to such a fopling, but then I doubt her taste; and it gave me once great pleasure to hear Godolphin say that no woman had ever written a satire?" The lively Grace bowed to the compliment, for a compliment to the sex, in general, is viewed as homage to some fair crea- ture in particular. But I noticed that at the name of Godol- phin she started, and her eyes actually flashed a volley of elo- quence. In the course of this history, I shall have much to say of Henry Godolphin, who was a man of considerable genius; "the poet of all circles and the idol of his own,".as Lord Byron said of Anacreon Moore. But to return; Charlotte Surry sat quite demurely, almost alone, and apparently abstracted from the buzz of small talk and bustle of the waltzing crowd, ind seemed the most quiet, unobtrusive body imaginable, until a wild-looking gentleman approached, and made some dashing remark to her. In a moment her whole being seemed changed as if by magic, and the light of her dark eye beamed with in- telleotual radiance. 3   22         qOSE MLTON: "Well," said Miss Chatterton, "have you satisfied your curiosity?" "Perhaps; but who is that wild-looking person that is-speak- ing with your literary lady? I would know that man in a thousand, and yet, believe me, I never saw him before this moment." I thought his appearance would strike you; why, don't you know him, then?  That is Lovat Frazer, a great inventor."* Inventor! what has he invented? pray inform me." "(That is beyond my power; but he has a scheme for uniting Europe and America by means of a rubber road." "A what?"I asked in amazement "I fear you think that I am quizzing you; but the fact is just what I have stated. He has conceived the project of an Indian rubber road, so broad that the waves shall not overturn the track, and cast the locomotive into the sea; and, to guard against storms, each engine is to be provided with an apparatus for discharging oil on the ocean." "But how is he to prevent the engine from submerging the track?" "Oh, I thought you would ask that question, it is so like you! But he has guarded against that catastrophe by attaching a balloon to the engine. You laugh! Now, I assure you that * He was a descendant of that George Villiers, Duke of Bucking- ham, who wrote the "Rehearsal," and was satirized by Dryden, in ,' Absalom and Ahithophel," under the name of Zimri:- "In the first rank of these did Zimri stand, A man so various, that he seem'd to be Not one, but all mankind's epitome. Stiff in opinion, always in the wrong; Was everything by starts, and nothing long; But in the course of one revolving moon, Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon! Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking, Besides ten thousand freaks that dy'd in thinking. Blest madman, who could every hour employ With something new to wish or to enjoy!"   A ROMANCE.           23 -he has been in Washington city these six months, seeking to obtain a patent for what he calls a new motor." "Excuse me, Miss Chatterton, but----  "No," said she, in her good-humored way; "I will not ex- cuse you, for you were going to say that I must be as mad as he is to rattle on in this wild style. He is, however, a gentle- man of genius, and persists in the practicability of his scheme, perhaps, because he meets with so much ridicule and opposition on all sides." That this is the age of inventions and the rage for inventions, no one will deny; for who would have dreamed that a young, beautiful girl-just sweet seventeen-would take -so much in- terest in a wild, chimerical scheme, for uniting two continents separated by three thousand miles of bounding billows? Heaven help us and the age in which we live! If the schoolmaster is abroad, he has certainly turned engineer, and will, ere long, turn the head of every woman in the model republic. Who knows but that Lucy Stone and Lucretia Mott may yet succeed in inventing a system by which the world may be peopled with- out the aid of those trumpery things-the men! Five to one on Lucy!* "Yes," continued Miss Chatterton, " this is the age of in- ventions, as you have justly remarked; and further to impress you with the ingenuity of Lovat Frazer, I must tell you that, during the late cold, he cut six inches from the bottom of his cloak and sewed it to the top of it, boasting that he had length- ened his cloak six inches by the operation." It was impossible to resist this last " sally" of my " ally," and I was yet laughing when I heard my name audibly pro. nounced, and turning, saw young Archibald Hamilton making towards me. I shall have much to say of this gentleman, since so distinguished, but then just on the verge of manhood,. and in the first blush of those military honors which were poured upon him in sparkling showers; it is necessary, there- * This was written before that luminary was eclipsed by marriage.   24         ROSE MLTON: fore, that I should describe his appearance. He was of the medium height, handsomely formed, graceful, and possessing the most elegant manners of any man. His head and face were perfect specimens of intellectual beauty; the forehead broad and full, eyes black, bright, and reading your thoughts at a glance-and for his nose, mouth, and chin, I can only liken them to the nose, mouth, and chin of Napoleon-or, rather, the General Bonaparte of Paul-De La Roche. But it was his voice that made me love that man; it was so rich, so sweet, so manly, and yet so womanly in its elegant and exqui- site eloquence. To judge him merely by his manners, you would supptse that he was designed to be the accomplished Sybarite of society merely; but your supposition would have been entirely at fault, for he was designed by nature to be a chief of men, and he had already, for he was only a lieutenant of infantry, acquired considerable &lat as a brave and skilful soldier. Clouds may pass over the career of such a character, but native energy and unflinching integrity regard nor shine nor shower, but steadily pursue their way to honor and to fame. That he had difficulties to contend with, that they swarmed around him for a time, that he had former friends for foes, it is not my purpose to palliate or deny. But it is impossible for a man of mark, a man with strong points of character and steadiness of conduct, to pass through the human shambles without being assailed, reviled, traduced, and denounced. At the moment, however, that I have introduced him to your acquaintance, he was in the bud, the bloom, of his life and labors; and there was a. certain freshness in his appearance, and occasionally spiciness in his conversation, that was really captivating; at least so the women said, and they are goodjudges of a man, as Charles Chatterbox observes in his famous speech. When our greeting was over, and I had introduced him to my lively little friend-there is no friend like a woman--"we   A ROMANCE.           25 -three" knocked about the ball of conversation with consider- able vivacity. "I have," said Hamilton, when there was a pause in our talk, "just had an interview with one of the most remarkable men that this age has produced; a character so great in its first developments, as Jefferson said of Lafayette, that they would honor the close of any other." "Your praise is nectar," cried Miss Chatterton, "but are you, like Mr. Lexington, a Jeffersonian?" "I am a soldier," replied Hamilton, "and not a politician, but I have been strongly solicited to discard the sword. You know the old saying about soldiers in peace, and chimneys in summer?         .  "True, general, I mean lieutenant," said Grace, taking her- self up, and bowing gracefully, " but soldiers are our guard- ians." The compliment was received by a bow as graceful as that of Grace herself, and, perceiving that they were fast gliding into each other's good graces, I slipped away, for the purpose of paying my respects to the great white chief of that hunting ground, the Honorable Mr. Henry Petty Lansdowne, cousin- german to the Queen of England, by his marriage with the Honorable Mrs. Lansdowne, of Bowood Park, Wilts.  At the moment of my approach, he was conversing with a young lady whose personal beauty was a thing to dream about. I am not a great admirer of what is called female beauty, your Venus and Minerva of society, with their nose, and lip, and chin, of the same "formal cut," like the beard of the justice in the "Seven Ages of Man ;" for-I have never yet seen the woman that could stand inspection. The face, whatever may be its lineaments, is absolutely nothing, if it be not set on a noble neck, and that neck the column of falling shoulders, and rounded bust. Where had I seen that face, that form-that lovely form, so full of the silent poetry which has intoxicated the poets of all ages? and her manners too, so well bred, so 3*   26         ROSE MLTON: aristocratic, and yet so full of sweet suavity that they seemed to have magnetized the Honorable Mr. Lansdowne? for he was bowing and cooing like the mighty cock pigeon described by Washington Irving. I had scarcely heard the concluding sen- tence of her reply to some exaggerated oompliment, when con- siderable commotion- appearing to prevail in a distant part of the room, the Honorable Mr. Lansdowne inquired of Mr. Plantagenet, who was escorting the beautiful stranger, "what the matter was?" To which Mr. Plantagenet replied, "that Miss Lansdowne had fainted." ' Fainted!" exclaimed the honorable gentleman, advancing grandly to the scene of disaster. 'Ah! I see! as my Julia is, my Cornelia was!" With the aid of salts, the young lady was restoredand with her restoration, order resumed its reign. I therefore presented myself and my humble respects to the man'who was "spacious in the possession of dirt." He received me cordially, as cor- dially as such a character could receive any one, and actually condescended to converse with me on various topics, particu- larly those relating to his imported horses, dogs, and sheep. I did not dare to ask after his Berkshire pigs, for the very name of Berkshire gave him the horrors. He, like my friend Cap- tain Bolyn, already described in my memoirs, had exhausted immense sums of money, to say nothing of the ducks consumed as food, in attempting to demonstrate the fact that Berkshire pigs could be made profitable if he could but once succeed in inducing them to live. But with all his experiments the facts would prove false, for the pigs would die, in spite of all his orations at the agricultural boards, and all the long articles, headed "longevity of Berkshire pigs," which he caused to be printed and published, north, south, east, and west, and in every agricultural and political paper, besides having them in- serted in that invaluable work, the Patent Office Reports, which has enlightened the country as if a great ball of fire was rolling down from Maine to Mexico.   A ROMANCE.           27 I had occasion frequently to notice, during my interview with the honorable and distinguished gentleman, the sycophancy and subserviency of his guests. A stranger to the society of Afton would have imagined that the host was his "grace, the Duke of Grafton," or some power between "the devil and the king," as mentioned by Pope in his epistle to Bathurst. We make a great fuss, on our national anniversary, of liberty and independence, and senators in Congress, and politicians out of Congress, prate about democracy, freedom, and equality, and multiply without end all the public and republican cant phrases and catch-calls. But who with a head to think and a heart to feel is not on fire with indignation when he surveys our social system, and witnesses the utter prostration, Wody and soul, of our great republicans, to some vile and worthless villain whose only merit consists in his contempt for the cowardly wretches who cringe and creep before him, and' lick his feet like dogs? Is this the young republic, the hope, the stay, the Saviour of sinners, the refuge of the broken heart, the universal church of freedom? O, thou heavenly goddess, thou blue-eyed maid of heaven, grant me the shares of Fate, that I may cut into mince-meat these subservient scoundrels who fawn like spaniels on the worthless and the wealthy, and tyrannize like cowards over the honest sons of science and of song! The first that came was Mr. Izard Izard, who bowed, coughed, and hoped his excellency-Mr. Lansdowne had some years previously been governor of the State, and was, therefore, mentioned on all occasions as "his excellency," as if the insig- nificant office of governor of a State were really something ex- cellent-he hoped his excellency was well; it would afflict him to learn that his excellency had been indisposed; his indisposition would affect the health of the State; the State would be totally ruined should any accident happen to his excellency; and Mr. Izard Izard passed on, the Honorable Mr. Lansdowne merely giving him a cold formal bow, not deigning to speak one word!   28         ROSE MLTON: Why should he? Great men received their health as a special deposit, to be used on great occasions only, such as political barbacues, and the race-course, when Scarlet wins the field. We had scarcely resumed our conversation, when six young ladies, having occasion to cross the room, paused as they passed us. I knew them all to be birds of a feather, and removed a little that they might display their charms in the approaching interview; there was not one heart in all the six, and all their diamonds were paste. Their name were Julia Uxbridge, -Mary Stuart, Anne Northington, Augusta Beresford, Clara Middleton,* and Maria Gadsden.* "Your grace will pardon us," said the fair Clara, with a coiutesy which might be called "serving on the knee," that being the true regal style in the old time, " but we could not pass by without trespassing." (I might commit another Rape of the Lock' for that pun," replied the great man, with more adroitness than I thought he possessed; Obut there can be no trespass without tribute." And so he kissed them all, beginning with the fair Clara, Who had spoken so well, and ending with the five who had not spoken at all; bowing and cooing among the women seemed to be his vocation, occupation, and avocation. And what per- haps may puzzle the sensibilities of some, the fairest virgins appeared to regard it as the highest honor that their cherub lips should be touched by his handsome mouth. "I wonder," said Gamage Bull, "if Cotton ap Rice has succeeded in making a crop?" "He don't deserve to succeed, sir," replied- Mr. Lansdowne; "the man who won't irrigate his lands deserves his fate. He deserves his fate, sir. He deserves that the water, which is designed to refresh and renew their fertility, should stagnate, and turn sour. Rice ap Cotton is just such another.' * Neither of these young ladies were daughters of our late minis- ters to St. Petersburg and Mexico; they were collaterally, not imme- diately, related to those public characters.   A ROMANCE.            29 C( He has turned politician lately," remarked the Honorable Mr. Bull Frog, a distant relative of that Frog of whom Judge Johnson tells the anecdote. Mr. Frog, going to church to have a son christened, called at a friend's, requesting him to furnish a Christian name for the infant. This friend being a wag, suggested the name of John Bull, that being the name of the most popular of all the royal governors. The friends proceeded to the christening, and it is actually a fact that, on the name of John Bull being communicated to the officiating ministeri the child was christened by the ludicrous name of Bull Frog.* But on the other hand-and to show the power of names-the Frog family have risen up in the world, and now hold their heads pretty high, the most striking difference between our Mr. Frog and the frog of the fable consisting in this, that the frog of the fable was swelled in the body, but our Mr. Frog is what is vulgarly called a swelled head. "He has turned politician--has he?" remarked Mr. Lans- downe, with a sneer; " and much good win it do him. He is arepublican, sir-a rank republican. Now, sir," said he, turn- ing to young Drayton Hall, a relative of the once famous Mrs. Daniel Hall, "I won't trust a republican.  They are all Tories. The Tories of the American Revolution are the repub- licans of our revolution, for we are all turning over by the operation of the free suffrage bill. The free suffrage bill, sir"--and he directed his remarks to Mr. Harry Gibbs, an old aristocrat, who praised the lords and damned the commons- "the free suffrage bill, sir, will destroy the country, for what * This anecdote was as follows: Governor Bull was a great favor- ite, and parents frequently named their children after him. There was a tailor named Frog, who, influenced by some kindness of Jqrn Walters Gibbs, asked that person to be the godfather for his son. When the parties were going to the font, Gibbs asked permission to name the child after the governor. Permission being granted, the child was baptized John Ball; hence the Bull Frogs of. Afton.   30         ROSE MLTON: is that country worth where every man has a right to vote the property from my pocket into his own, sir?" "That's the obVious operation of free suffrage," said the Honorable Mr. Frog. "Yes," continued Mr. Lansdowne, puffing himself up as if he had some near affinity to the frog in the fable, " there you hit the mark, for that is the obvious operation of free suffrage. The republicans are great rogues, sir, great rogues-they are free suffrage men." "I don't think/' said Wilmot Tidy aan* to Moultrie Mani- gault, " that the republicans have ruined the country." The remark of Wilmot Tidyman fell like a thunder-clap on the ear of Mr. Manigault, who had been drinking in every word uttered by his idol as if it had been nectar; and he actually recoiled a pace or two, as if expecting that the walls would fall, and crush the audacious plebeian who should doubt , the wisdom of the aristocratic Mr. Lansdowne; then drawing himself up to his full height, five feet nothing, he clothed his face in so much scorn that he might have made a milk-woman turn to vinegar. "What," thought he, for he was too full to speak-"what, have you the, impudence to express your opinion in tis presence?" But he mel the gaze of an honest man-full of his own sex-and proud of that integrity which had won for him a position as far above the cringing cowards of society as the eagle of Jove towers above the cravens of the earth. What a contrast they presented as they regarded each other! The-old aristocrat, full of stupid amazement, and the young republican, fired with that glorious spirit of independence which had warmed the heart of Jefferson, and nerved the mighty arm of the matchless Washington. Sud- * This gentleman once had a bitter quarrel with Ladson Smith, who, relating it to Godolphin, said: "After that, I gave him a Smith look." "Indeed!" quoth G., " and what kind of a look is that?" "Why," replied Ladson, "a Smith look, you know, is very contemptible!" (for contemptuous.)   A ROMANCE.           31 denly the brow of Wilmot Tidyman turned as dark as death. He, the honest son of gallant sires, who had spent their last dollar in obtaining freedom for America-he whose bread was earned by the sweat of his burning brow, for midnight found him often at his desk, striving to enlarge the sphere and use- fulness of man as a legislator-he who saw in the horizon of his hopes the prize of excellence as his reward for days and nights of labor, burning, blasting labor-he, to be spurned by this " painted child of dirt," whose trifling head and corrupted heart disgraced the new world with the follies of the old- "fop at the toilet, flatterer-at the board"-'Sdeath! his heart was in his throat, and raising his clenched hand, he held it before the eyes of his antagonist, saying, in a voice of irrepres- sible bitterness: "Remember! thou white curd of asses' milk," and passing by the old aristocrat, he joined a circle where John Beresford and Robert Montague were trying to eclipse each' other, and win a smile of approbation from the beautiful Celestine Queensbury. "You must permit me," said Miss Queensbury to Tidyman, as he approached her, "to thank you, cordially, for the copy of poems you were so good as to send me. But who is Edward Coate Pinckney?" "He is a young poet of Maryland, and son of the great lawyer," replied Tidyman. "Or rather," said Miss Queensbury, " the great lawyer is the father of the greater son, for the last will survive the first. I am much pleased with his 'Italy.' "But what say you," observed Tidyman, to his descrip- tion of a lovely woman?" 'Exchanging lustre with the sun, A part of day she strays-- A glancing, living, human smile, On nature's face that plays.' "I like that 'human smile,/" remarked Miss Queensbury; "for to me there is no magic like a smile; let me have the   82         ROSE MLTON: powers of smiling, like Mary Washington,.and I would ask no other gift, for it is the only magician." "Say, rather, the greatest," replied Tidyman, "for the 'shore' and sand' have their smile; and to quote from the Italy'- It looks a dimple on the face of earth, The seal of beauty and the shrine of mirth.' That dimple is, indeed, a seal and shrine!" said the sweet Celestine, and smiling, she produced what Tidyman thought far sweeter dimples than the poet's " smile." My attention was drawn at this time to a byplay which was being acted elsewhere-the parties being Mr. Plantagenet and Miss Fanny Walsingham, who was the beautiful stranger that had attracted my attention by her captivating address. He had led her to a seat from the dance, and was trying to ingra- tiate himself by those little attentions that a lover pays to the idol of his heart. But, on taking her seat, she had resumed her cold but gentle courtesy of conduct, assenting gracefully to his remarks, but still limiting the bounds of her conver- sation by simple monosyllables. There was, however, a charm in her air and style that was truly bewitching, and I did not wonder that Plantagenet was fascinated by her exquisite per- sonal attractions. Of her mental superiority I was convinced, for I had seen enough of her demeanor to assure me that it was not inferior to her personal charms. There are individuals whose whole character is developed by a single glance, or the slightest word, and Fanny Walsingham was one of those inte- resting characters. Born of opulent parents, the proud heiress moved in the first circle of society, receiving homage as her inheritance, and flattery-as the current coin due from man to woman. She did not doubt the superiority of her sex; how, in- deed, could she doubt? She saw men ever at her feet, striving to serve her in every possible way, and it would, therefore, have been truly wonderful in a young girl of eighteen if, judg- ing from all that she had ever seen or known since coming   A ROMANCE.           33 into the world, she had not regarded men as the first of created beings-after woman. Alas for woman and her fortunes! Little did this fair young creature dream of the misery that was in store for her proud and princely heart-the mortifi- cation, the more than death, that was to crush her spirit, her hopes, her health, and her happiness at one fell swoop. And of all that proud throng, the Beauforts, the Rutledges, the Ellenboroughs, the Granvilles, the Washingtons, and the :'Pinckneys, what remains? Who can portray the disasters that consigned them and their sorrows to the vortex of misery? My heart beats with anguish as I record these words, for the friends of my youth-where are they? Where those generous hearts that made the sunshine of my society?--where the fair women who were the passion of my soul? I see them now in my mind's eye, full of life and love, full of hope and health and happiness; but for the present, let us view them by the "Iight of other days;" the terrible future will overtake and overcome them soon enough. I had drawn myself apart,and was silently contemplating the scene presented by these lovers-for .I did not doubt the nature of Miss Walsingham's feelings towards Plantagenet- when I was pained to notice that he suddenly put his hand to his head, and then rush from the room like a madman. Miss Walsingham gazed in astonishment at his retreating figure, but, recovering herself, she bent her eyes to the floor for a mo- ment, but in that moment what a change had taken place! A sudden consciousness of cruelty, the firstpang of the heart that she had ever felt, seemed to strike her with the weight of iron; and she gazed at the door through which Plantagenet had retreated, as if her heart, and sense, and soul were in that searching gaze. But he came not. He had fled like a mad- man, he knew not whither, and I had already turned to follow him, when Hamilton placed his hand on my arm. "This is lucky," I observed, " for you are the very man I would wish to speak with in private." 4   34         ROSE MLTON: "I understand you, Lexington," he replied, "for I witnessed the conduct of Plantagenet, and as I know his impetuous nature, the sooner we seek and save him, the better." And arm in arm Hamilton and myself left the room together. "Ah me!" said Hamilton, as we descended the steps of the splendid mansion, "what a tangled net we weave when first we venture, not to deceive, but to win a woman!" CHAPTER    III. THE residence of Plantagenet being at the foot of Meeting Street, we had a long chase, 'but, wrapped in our cloaks and walking at a quick step, we did not feel the cold, which was really intense. When we reached his residence, we found the front, or street door open, and, without pausing to ring the bell, we hastened to the sitting-room, which was on the base- ment back from the street. 2 Tit door was open, a light was burning on the centre-tabl6, a wood fire was blazing in the chimney; and standing near the fire, with his hands in his pockets, and his eyes nearly out of their sockets, stood Rich- mond, the trusty valet of Plantagenet. "Well, Riohmond," said I," where's your master?" The frightened servant would have answered if he could, but he could not. "Don't you hear?" said Hamilton, shaking him, "or have you lost your voice?" Richmond tried to speak, but his voice failed him, and  taking one of hiands from his pocket) he slowly pointed to the door. "Gone?" asked Hamilton, who was warming his hands by the fire.   A ROMANCE.           35 "Lord bless you!" cried Richmond, like a young cataract just broke loose-'"yes, sir-gone!" "Where to? can't you tell us? Did he leave any message for me, or did he say where he was going? Can't you speakl?" Richmond having recovered his scattered intellects, now in- formed us that, only a few moments before our arrival, his master had returned home, armed himself . ith a brace of pis- tols, and departed again, saying merely that Richmond should call for him next morning at Mr. Cavendish's. "I know there's something wrong," continued Richmond, ' and when he goes to Mr. Cavendish's, he always drinks. For God's sake, Mr. Lexington, you and Mr. Hamilton go there, and bring master home again; if you don't, he'll shoot hisself, or kill me, when I go to Mr. Cavendish's for him in the morning. Do, pray, sir; let me beg you, sir." "Very well, Richmond," replied Hamilton, "as we are in pursuit of Mr. Plantagenet, we may as well encounter him at Mr. Cavendish's as here, or anywhere. But can you tell whether or no the pistols were loaded?" "I drew the loads this morning myself, but master may have loaded them since."  "MJay have?" said I; "why, then the chances are in our favor, and the sooner we are off the better." It was now about midnight. The streets were deserted, ex- cept by the sleepy watchmen, who slowly paced their guarded round. To all our inquiries, the guardians of the night gave indistinct replies. One had seen such a person as we described; another had seen no such person; he had seen a short man without a cloak, but had not seen a tall man with a cloak. A third had seen both tall men and short men, and some had pistols, and some not; but then most of them had walking-stieks, and those that walked with sticks' generally bad lighted cigars in their mouths; cigars and sticks being the insignia of "the sons of night." In a word, we soon perceived that the only way to satisfy our curiosity was to proceed at once to Caven-     36         ROSE MLTON: dish's; accordingly, we walked up Meeting Street, then we walked into Queen, from Queen into King, and after walking about a mile we turned into Rule, and from Rule we got, not to Cow, but Cannon's bridge, but it didn't look much like a cannon-and wheeling ourselves, and then marching forward, sometimes deploying to the right, and sometimes to the left, we found ourselves at length directly in front of the mansion owned and occupied by Mr. William Cavendish. He was- but I sha'n't describe him; he will occupy a conspicuous space in the canvass of this picture, and will therefore have every opportunity of introducing himself, his acts, his deeds, his thoughts, his opinions, moral, religious, and political, to all those gentlemen who are "curious in fish sauce,' and all those ladies 'who die of a rose in aromatic pain." I rang the bell, and a servant appearing, stated in reply to our inquiry that Mr. Plantagenet was with Mr.' Cavendish. We therefore determined to announce ourselves, instead of sending up our names, and accordingly directed. the servant to lead us to the apartment of his master. When we entered, we discovered Plantagenet sittidig at a table with his pistols lying before him. Standing in front of the fire, with a skirt of his coat in each hand, was Mr. Cavendish, smiling and jest- ing in his usual way. I have said that his character will dis- play itself in the course of this history, but it is necessary that some description should be given of his personal appearance. He was about five feet ten inches in height, neatly and nicely formed, for he was a Corinthian, or blood of the first water; his dress was elegantly fitted to his person-a blue coat and pants, a white vest, white cravat, and a red scarf slightly dis- playing its folds beneath the rolling collar of his waistcoat. His face was striking, oval in form, of great mobility, and ad- mirably in keeping with the abandon of his manners. At a first glance, you would be prepossessed in his favor; but, when you noticed his eye and lips, you observed a certain something lying in wait, and lurking to find occasion for ridicule or    A ROMANCE.           37 revenge. fHe had, too, great gifts of conversation, so far as slang phrases gof expressing himself with fluency and with the easy volubility of a man of ton, which he was, every inch of him, for he had as much brass as would make a kettle, and sauce enough to fill it.* "Ha, my Pips-Lexington and Hamilton!" exclaimed Mr. Cavendish, advancing and shaking hands with us, "you have just come in time to witness the final exit of oup friend Plan- tagenet." Heavens! what a pang his -levity caused me to feel at that moment! I gave him a look of withering scorn, and turning to Plantagenet, placed my hand upon his brow, for he had not moved, but still sat, and looked at the-pistols before him. His head was hot as fire, and I could feel his temples throbbing with intense excitement. He had been drinking, for I no- ticed a bottle of wine standing near the pistols. Still holding one hand to his brow, with the other I recorked the bottle, and then spoke to him. But he made no reply. His thoughts were elsewhere. He did not seem to recognize my presence, but kept his eyes on the pistols, as if in them alone were solace and relief from the vulture that was torturing his heart. "Plantagenet," said I," will you not speak to me?" He made no reply, but placed his hand on the bottle. I put my hand on his, and said, "Will you not speak to me, your friend, Henry Lexington?" "O!" said he, in a tone that went like an arrow to my heart, "I have had such a dream;" and, looking up as if he saw a vision in the clouds, he burst into tears, and hid his face in his hands. * He was a lineal descendant of William Catendish, the first Duke of Devonshire, who died August 18, 1707. A younger son of the Duke settled in Afton. Those who are familiar with the personal reminiscences of Sir John Nesbit must have a lively remembrance of this younger brother. 4*   88,        ROSE MLTON: For the life of me, I could not resist the sympathizing tear that fell upon that noble head. But with the flow of tears I knew that his senses would' return. I therefore made a sign to Hamilton, who removed the bottle and pistols-those scourges of mankind-and gently raised him from his seat. I now noticed, for the first time, the change that had taken place in his features. O they were changed! the soft hue of youth had vanished, and in his lineaments I traced the primal eldest curse, the hue of Cain-for blood was upon that brow. Blood! I felt my breath suspended. Had. he then attempted to com- mit suicide? In defiance of every law, human and divine, goaded by passion, and stung by jealousy and love, for there is a sting in love that breaks the heart, he had sought to de- stroy that life which was created to perpetuate the glory of the universe. I have looked on blood shed in battle, and gone my way, but that small red spot on the brow of my friend glowed like the eye of a demon, and appalled my sight. Till then I had not dreamed what love or woe could inflict on the heart of man or woman; but I must not anticipate. "Yes," said he, observing my consternation, "it is all over. I have turned it over in my mind. You may reason, argue, remonstrate, expostulate; but I tell you, Lexington,that you reason, argue, remonstrate, expostulate in vain. Why should I live? The fates have decreed it otherwise. Fortune is against me! It is useless to swim against the tide"- "Cease your raving," said I, "and listen to me. You must return home." "-Never-never!" exclaimed he; " the very sight of home, is hateful to me." Alas, thought I, what must be the feelings of that man whose home is hateful to him! The great world of society may have its charms; great thoughts, great deeds, may tempt us to emulate the warrior and the statesman; but what are all these worth when compared to the silent scenes and sweet society of dear native home?   A ROMANCE.           39 "Why do you urge him to return?" asked Cavendish; "I take it very unkind of you, and regard it as a reflection on my hospitality." "Cavendish," said Hamilton, who noticed that I did not desire to withdraw my attention from Plantagenet, " you must be aware that the only object of our visit was to recover our friend, and restore him to, the quiet of his own home; and this we will accomplish." "And this you shall not," replied Cavendish, assuming an air of offended dignity. "This is my house, and if Planta-. genet prefers remaining here, he shall do so, in defiance of any interference on the part of yourself and Mr. Lexington." The face of .Hamillon flushed crimson at this speech, for really despising Caventlish, he felt the indignity of such lan- guage being addressed to him. He raised his hand to strike; but the pride of propriety, which so strongly marked his cha- racter, induced him to pause, and turning from Cavendish with contempt, he approached the table by which Plantagenet abd myself were standing. "Plantagenet," said he, in that melodious voice which falls like "the sweet south," "I have come here with Lexington, for the purpose of desiring you to return to your own house. In your present condition, we insist that you accede to our re- quest, for you shall not remain in this place." "Don't mind what he says, P.," exclaimed Cavendish; "you are well enough where you are. I can give you a bed, and Hamilton can give you no more." "A No, indeed," replied Hamilton; "but you can, and that marks the difference between us." The insinuation implied in the speech of Hamilton, instead of exciting the wrath of Cavendish, had just the contrary effect, as it seemed to restore him to perfect good-humor, for. he laughed, rubbed his hands and spit between his fingers, in imitation of Sir Julius Caesar, the low comedian. Whilst Hamilton was expostulating with Plantagenet, I took   40         ROSE MLTON: up the pistols, and discovered that they had both been dis- charged; but whether by Richmond, or his master, I could not determine, but perhaps the latter, as the cocks were in the pans. "Do you wish to load them?" asked Cavendish; if you do, I can furnish you with Dupont's double eagle-superfine for sporting!" "I regret extremely," said I, "that you speak to me in this tone of levity-at another time I might resent it; but for the present you must excuse me from retorting;" and read- justing the locks, I placed the pistols under my arm-they were long duelling pistols, with saw handles-and retired, fol- lowed by Plantagenet and Hamilton. CHAPTER IV. IT was so late when we arrived at Plantagenet's that we concluded to pass the night at his house. From the time of leaving Cavendish's, to his arrival at his own house, Plantage- net had not uttered one syllable; nor could we, after our arri- val, induce him to utter one word, notwithstanding our united efforts to engage him in conversation. A reaction appeared to have taken place in his system, and, instead of the excitement which he exhibited when I met him at Cavendish's, his nerves were unstrung, and he sank into his seat with the helplessness of a child. This prostration, however, did not extend to his organs of vision, for his eyes were brighter than usual, and their vigilance unceasing; not a word, look, or action escaped him. We advised him, therefore, to take a composing draught, and to retire for the night, which he did, Richmond being par- ticularly attentive to his afflicted master. As soon as Planta- genet had left the room, Hamilton and myself consulted as to   A ROMANCE.           41 -the course we should adopt in the present emergency, for it was evident that Fanny Walsingham had unsettled the wits of poor Richard Plantagenet, and the question was, what course was necessary to be pursued by Hamilton and myself. "It is evident," remarked Hamilton, " that, unless the mind of Plantagenet receive some diversion, he will destroy himself. He must be removed from this place." "That may be necessary," I replied, " but it occurs to me that there is another step equally necessary, and perhaps more politic, as concerns the parties, for my observations at Lans- downo's leave no doubt on my mind as to the real sentiments of Miss Walsingham. She is not coquetting with Plantage- net, but is really shielding herself with the reserve that is a part of the modesty of her sex. That she may be a little too cold, occasionally, is not only not unnatural or unreasonable, but results from the same system-the desire to preserve her pride, and. to keep the sentiment of love from being degraded." "Do you think, then," asked Hamilton, " that Miss Wal- singham loves Plantagenet?" "If she doesnot, then there is no truth in love, logic, or anything else. In fact, I think that she is the deepest of the two, only that her love finds its vent in tears, and his in storms." "If your observation is correct," replied Hamilton, "it may not be difficult to effect a reconciliation. But here we have a choice of difficulties." "The chief difficulties," said I, laughing at his quotation from the military dispatch of General Wolfe, and at its quaint applicability on the present occasion-" the chief difficulties are you and myself." "How? what do you mean?" inquired Hamilton, quickly; "I do not understand you; what impediment do we form to their reconciliation?'" "None, that I know of," said I, laughing again; but, as I saw that Hamilton thought I was merely jesting, I continued   42   '     -ROSE MLTON: by saying: "The difficulty that I speak of consists in this, that it is necessary one of us should speak to Miss Walsingham, as the delegate of Plantagenet." "If you think so," observed Hamilton, " why, then, do you not see her on the subject?" "I have already refused to do so," said I; "nor shall I do so on the present occasion. In the first place, I am a perfect stranger to Miss Walsingham; and in the second place, I don't like the business. With what face could I have the assurance to call upon an utter stranger, and remonstrate with her on account of her conduct to a friend of mine?" "Well, you may be right," quoth Hamilton, smiling-he never laughed "but, as I am well acquainted with her, I shall venture the experiment." "Faint heart, you know, according to King Gomez," said I, "never won fair lady." Adieu, then," said he, " for the present; I shall return in the morning;" and saying this, he put on his cloak and cap, and left me solitary and alone. I sat by the fire for some time, reflecting on the various events of the previous night- for day was speedily coming up this way-and passing in re- view the scenes that I had witnessed at Lansdowne's, the grand, entree of the young Lansdownes; the lively Charlotte Chat- terton; the six belles who were honored with a kiss by the great landed proprietor; the cringing crew of sycophants; and lastly, of the beautiful stranger, who received the courteous gallantry of Plantagenet with all the grace of a lovely woman. I thought of these things, and then followed a confused re- membrance of pistols, wine, and watchmen, when suddenly I heard a tremendous fall, and from certain symptoms of pain in my elbow, I discovered that I had been an hour asleep, like King Charles, under the old oak tree." When I had recovered from the shock of my downfall-not quite so shocking as that of the grand Napoleon's-I took myself up to the chamber of Plantagenet. To my amaze-   A ROMANCE.           43 ment, I found him striding up and down, as if the opiate had not subdued, but increased his excitement. As soon as his eyes encountered mine, he stopped, and for a moment he seemed to menace me with personal violence. But I resolutely kept my eyes fixed in his, and perceiving that he paused in his de- sign, I approached him and took him by the arm. He was trembling with emotion. "Plantagenet," said I, " are you not better now?" He looked at me long and wistfully before he spoke. "I have known- you from my boyhood," said he, "and yet you were the first to desert me." "Desert you! What are you dreaming about?   So far from deserting, I have done all in my power to aid and' assist you." "Then I have wronged you, Lexington, for I did think that you had abandoned me to the demon." "What demon?   I do not understand you. I have seen no demon." "It is here-here!" he exclaimed, beating his breast with his clenched hand. "I feel it tearing, torturing, rending my heart and head!" 'Why, this is fantasy! Your nerves are excited, and un- less you take some rest--" "Rest! I cannot rest! I have tried to sleep, but my dreams create visions that are terrible, too terrible to be endured. I see her waking or dreaming, here, there, everywhere, pursuing me, upbraiding me! * I knew how idle it would be to reason with one in his state of. mental and bodily excitement, and therefore I endeavored to restore him to his senses by those little attentions which go so far to soothe a proud and wounded spirit. I rekindled the fire, trimmed- the lamp, placed a comfortable chair for him, and invited him to take a seat by my side. He gradually relaxed from his hostile attitude, and took the chair I had selected for him, but sighing at times as if his heart would break.   "        ROSE MLTON: "You are calmer now," said I, as he sank back in his seat, and covered his eyes with his hand, as if he would court the sleep I so much needed. "Yes," said he, "your presence obliterates the vision, and I feel that I am free once more. Do you know what has oc- curred this evening?" and taking his hands from his eyes, he gazed at me as if reading my very soul. "Do you know what has occurred this evening?" "I do not know all, but I can imagine that some powerful cause impelled you to place your life in jeopardy." "It is strange," said he; "I cannot comprehend it!" "What do you mean by it ." said I, perplexed by his remark. "Why those pistols! I discharged them both, placing the muzzles against my head, but the balls would not penetrate; they must have glanced;" and placing both his hands to his head, pressed his fingers as if trying to trace the track of the balls. Little did he know that the balls had been extracted, but I, did not venture to undeceive him. Still I could not account for the blood upon his brow. In passing his fingers round to his forehead, they touched the bloody spot. He must have felt some pain, for he immediately held his fingers to the light, and saw the blood. His look of wonder at the sight, for the blood had tinged his fingers, made me think for the mo- ment that the wound was accidental, but a sudden gleam of intelligence lighted up his handsome face, and he said, "Oh, I remember now!" How came it there?"I asked. "Why, you must know," said he, "that I made a bet with Cavendish that he could not hit me in the head at ten paces." "Merciful heavens!"I exclaimed, "and did he inflict that wound?" "He missed the first shot," continued Plantagenet, "but drawing blood at the second fire, he won the bet."   A ROMANCE.           45 "The execrable assassin!- I will have him arrested before twelve hours roll over his .head!" "Not for the world," replied Plantagenet; "it was at my instance that he fired, and you must promise me that you will not pursue this affair." It was useless to argue with him in his present condition, and in truth, as I perceived that he was gradually recovering his faculties, it would have been extremely wrong in me to withhold the promise which he exacted. But my opinion of the character of Cavendish was now confirmed; and I deter. mined that henceforth I would do all in my power to dissolve the unnatural intimacy which existed between them. I had long dreaded the influence of a man like Cavendish over the quick, impulsive temperament of Plantagenet; nor could I ever account for the friendship which existed between them-they were so opposite in their natures, habits, pursuits, and charac- ters. But I had yet to learn, that men of the most opposite natures will assimilate on some one point, and that one point become the centre of the firmest friendship. But, in aceding to the request of Plantagenet, I enjoined upon him the neces- sity of avoiding the society of a man who, under the disguise of frivolity, concealed a deep and subtle villany, whose game was woman, and whose instruments were the unsuspecting and impulsive youths whom he lured within his toils, by affecting to promote their pleasures. Having spoken t Plantagenet as freely as I could venture at that time, I finally succeeded in calming his feelings, and inducing him to seek the repose his system so much needed. i    '5   "        ROSE MLTON: CHAPTER V. WE must now trace the conduct of Hamilton. He had left me, expressing his determination to seek an interview with Fanny Walsingham, and as I knew him to be resolute, I felt. considerable solicitude for the result; but then I was well ac- quainted with the chivalry of his character, which would sus- tain him in any contest with the sex. There stands a brick house near the foot of King Street, just sufficiently retired from the street to permit the cultiva- tion of a few flowers. The house was very old, had the ap- pearance of having been once very red, like, the face of an old toper; but now it was blacked and battered by the hand of time, and scorched to boot by the sun of the south. You might have guessed that it was not inhabited by some " mush- room new civilian," but that it was. owned by one of those old families who trace their ancestors to the time of William the Conqueror and William Coeur de, Lion. Hence it is that in Afton one can judge of the family by the house; for it is true that, the older the. house, the older the family. Paint is an abomination in the eye of the old regime; it views all things through the vista of years, and what time has not sanctified, it discards as " base, common, and popular." But we must enter the house, instead of discoursing of its exterior, for there is, in one of the apartments of that same old house, a young lady who was destined, ere long, to become con- spicuous in consequence of her variety of fortunes. It was night. A single lamp was burning on the centre-table. Sit- ting at that table, with a copy of Shelley's poems in her hands, was a beautiful girl; she had chanced to turn to "Juan and Madallo" and, after reading the opening lines, she paused to   A ROMANCE.           47 recall the image of Byron, the Madallo of the poet. "What a fascinating person he must have been!" said she inly, " to charm at once the fairest woman and the sweetest poets of hit day-of any day!" she thought, as her eye caught the name of Shelley on the title-page, for there is truly something exquisite in that poet's softer strains: "But why," said she, thought- fully, "were these immortal men banished from society? They must have been reformers!" and, looking up, her eye encoun- tered the picture of Pope the poet, who, with his hand to his head, and his arm on the Iliad, was gazing at her with those eyes that were a glory in the reign of Anne. He had been a reformer too, but then how different had been his fortune, courted, caressed, not banished, like Byron and Shelley. She was perplexed, and, before she works out her sum, I shall steal the opportunity to present her picture. Her face was fair, with dark 'blue eyes and dark hair, which, contrary to the odious custom of the day, she permitted to float at liberty around her neck and shoulders. Her face wasaround, not full, the chin exquisitely modelled, and her lip glowed as if a "bee had newly stung it." Her' age, if I may venture to mention the age of a lady, was just seventeen; that is, I have heard so; but I shall not be so bold as to afirm that it was on my own responsibility, for no man knows what future has in store for him when he ever begins to talk about woman. For her per- son, it was neither tall nor short, but with a'blending of female elegance that was really eloquent in its proportions, and she had the great good sense to exercise modesty in her dress, in defiance of the law of fashion which has banished modesty long, long ago. En passant, the prevailing mode just now is to wear the dress so long that it would render the employment of street-sweepers by the city fathers superfluous, were it not for the fact that, to save the dress, the wearer holds it up so high that "garter king of arms"-but I sha'n't say any more, but return to my bird of beauty as before, or rather Plantagenet's, for the young lady of whom I have been prattling, with her   48         ROSE MLTON; eyes of blue, and floating tresses, was no other than Fanny Walsingham, ote of the fairest flowers of Afton, and the pride of its aristocracy, the old rjgime, with its ancestors still fight; ing for my Normandy, and "Charley over the water." She had not yet recovered from the puzzle of Pope and Byron, the first having been caressed, and the last banished, when Hamilton was announced, and entered the room with that smile on his face which never failed to secure him a most cordial welcome; nor did he ever receive a nore sincere recep- tion than that which was accorded to him by the beautiful Fanny Walsingham, on the present occasion. "You have just come in time," said she, laughing sweetly, "to help me through my difficulties." "Difficulties!" exclaimed Hamilton; "is there a difficulty which yotucannot overcome?" "That you shall learn presently," said she; ' but you must help me; will you do it?" "I will replyto you," observed Hamilton, "in the language addressed by a gallant gentleman to the Queen of France: If it be possible, it is done; if it be impossible, it shall be done.'  "Pray, then, tell me this: Why was Pope caressed; and Byron banished?" "That is one of the impossible difficulties that shall be over- come; but for the present, as you talk of banishment; let me plead the cause of one who deserves to be caressed instead of banished." "I do not understand you, Mr. Hamilton," replied Fanny, whose whole demeanor changed in a moment from cordial familiarity to cold formality. It is with no little apprehension that I venture to speak to you on a matter of such grave importance," said Hamilton, bowing; "' but your good nature will pardon me if I pass the bounds of prudence or of propriety." These words astonished Miss Walsingham so much, that it   A ROMANCE.           49 was some time before she replied. There was a certain diplo- matic ambiguity in the language of Hamilton, which left her in doubt as to the fact whether he was speaking for himself, or for another. But, luckily, her prudence-of which she had enough for twenty women-protected her, and prevented her from advancing until she could perceive whom, or what, she was to encounter. "If you have anything to communicate, I shall esteem it of the first importance, as it comes from one who has so long honored me with his friendship." Hamilton bowed to the splendid compliment with the chi- valric gallantry of a cavalier.  "The communication;" said he, "is sufficiently important of itself, without the extraneous aid of my humble abilities; but I must acknowledge that the solicitude I feel for my friend may result in causing you to discard me from the circle of your admirers." This reply gave a new turn to the thoughts of Fanny, for it was now evident that Hamilton was not speaking for himself, but for another, and as she looked' at the handsome young soldier the sweet smile returned to her face. "Mr. Hamilton," said Fanny, "I know the warmth of your nature, and have ever admired the steadiness of your friend- ship. How, then, could I, feeling thus, ever think harshy of you, from whose acquaintance I have derived so much plea- sure and instruction? You speak of admiration; pray do not let me forfeit your good opinion by doubting my desire to hear the communication you wish to make."  The eyes of Hamilton flashed with the fervor of his nature, as he listened to the honest speech of this noble girl. le in- stinctively rose to his feet, and approaching her, took her hand, kissed it respectfully, and seated himself by her side, resolved to speak when she was in the humor, "I trust, Miss Walsingham," commenced Hamilton, "that 5*   50         ROSE MLTON: you know me too well to suppose that I would approach you in behalf of any person who, was unworthy of your notice?" To'this cautious speech, by which Hamilton meant to feel his way, Miss Walsingham bowed, and Hamilton proceeded:- "We all at times yield to influences the most pernicious in their consequences, unless our good angel steps in to pacify and restore us. It is said that there is nothing stronger than man, except his own passions; and you may occasionally, young as you are, have witnessed the effect of passion on a proud and sensitive, but loving and adoring heart." Miss Walsingham again bowed to the observation of the ac- complished courtier, but heaved a sigh that struck the attentive ear of Hamilton. "It is of such a man that I have come to speak; it is for such a heart that I have come to plead. You will be generous in your sentence." "I trust, Mr. Hamilton," said Miss Walsingham, "that cruelty has no place in my nature. It is true that I have my likes and dislikes, as other women have; but you forget that as yet I know not, for a certainty, to whom you allude." "To avoid all ambiguity, then," and he bowed to her with respectful deference, "the person to whom I allude is Mr. Plantagenet." He paused to notice the effect of that name on the fair young creature, but she had apparently sunk into a reverie, though, from the quivering of her eyelids, he detected the in- terest she felt in the subject of his discourse. "I do not doubt; nay, I am certain," continued he, "that something has recently occurred between you which has ex- cited. your displeasure. His impulsive nature, and his deep abiding love for you, have perhaps induced him to be im- prudent in his conduct. If such has been really the fact, I truly regret it, for his better nature would revolt at the sus- picion of having been rude or unreasonable to the sole object of his affections."   A ROMANCE.           51 "I thank you, Mr. Hamilton, for the interest you exhibit in behalf of your friend, for I know that he is indued with all the qualities that you ascribe to him. But what would you have me do? I cannot yield to importunities that may be deemed impertinent. That Mr. Plantagenet has recently ex- hibited a passion for me, I could not fail to perceive, and that he may have touched my heart, I shall not deny; but his im- pulsive nature has constrained me to adopt a line of conduct that would preserve us both from the fatal precipice oi passion. If I have said aught to wound him, you may rest assured that it was not prompted by indifference, but rather from a desire to save him from himself, for he has but one enemy, and"- Here she paused, her feelings getting the better of her self- possession. "And one friend?" inquired Hamilton, deeply agitated; "may I place that construction on your words?" She made no reply, for her heart was full to overflowing. They were silent for some time, as he did riot dare to trifle with her emotion. But she was the first to speak. "Mr. Hamilton," said the lovely girl, "you may place that interpretation on my words' which your partiality for Mr. Plantagenet induced you to anticipate." "I feel grateful for the privilege," said he; "but will you increase my gratitude by granting me permission to convey these sentiments to Mr. Plantagenet? If you knew the present state of his mind-distracted to the very verge of frenzy, and tottering on that precipice of passion to which you alluded with such beautiful propriety-you would not deny me the grateful boon of restoring a heart now crushed and broken. I would not violate the sanctity of your love by impertinence, but still, my sweet friend, there is something due toone whose very existence is threatened by his deep' devotion, to you, and you only." "I know, I feel that you are right," said Miss Walsing- ham; "but I feel here," and she pressed her hand th her   52         ROSE MLTON: head, "that I am not wrong in withholding the permission you request. I am a woman, young, too young to be the ob- ject of so much attention; but-still I am a woman, and what- ever I may feel, and whatever I may suffer, I must bear 'the badge of sufferance' as becomes a woman. Believe me, Mr. Hamilton, I have felt far more than I have the power of inflict- ing, and in saying this, I reveal to you the secret of my heart, for I have that confidence in your friendship and integrity- endeared to me by so many tokens of regard-that I do not hesitate to trust you with a secret, which I have sharcely dared to reveal to myself. You have my. permission, therefore, to make any communication to your friend that you may justly infer from what I have said in this interview; but I enjoin upon you, by the friendship you entertain for my family, that you will not convey these sentiments as coming directly from myself. Will you not promise this?"And Miss Walsingham rose and placed her hand in those of Hamilton. "I promise," said he, pressing her hand with fervent grati- tude, and retired, glowing with the rapture of success. Fanny Walsingham remained as if rooted to the spot,. until the echoing steps of Hamilton aied away; she then turned her eyes from the door, and, resuming her seat, found relief from the intense agony which she had been suffering during the latter portion of her interview with Hamilton, by giving vent to a flood of tears. During the presence of Hamilton, she had felt that her prudence would -shield her from any im- propriety; but now that she was alone, she became alarmed at her temerity, and would have given worlds to recall the per- mission granted to the importunity of the gallant young cava- lier. "Oh, what have I done!" she exclaimed, in the fervor of her simple and sweet nature. "How could I be so impru- dent? A secret that I scarce breathed to myself will now become his property, and I shall be despised! I must see- ho, that will only make matters worse. I will write to Rose. Ohlf she were in Afton, instead of being at Lewisfield!"   A ROMANCE.            53 Trembling with anxiety and fear, she was soon busily en- gaged with her writing materials, hoping, in her distress, that the genius of her friend would save her from the imprudent step she had just taken, but how, or in what way, she had not the most distant conception. Rose had been the friend of Fanny from the earliest infancy; they had grown together, and the one seemed as much a part of the other as it was pos- sible for two girls to be. And. yet how different in their cha- racters! But of that the reader will judge, as he scans this little history, in which we propose to record some scenes of the great world of Afton, that were peculiarly adapted to portray the character of woman and her fortunes. And yet I have some hesitation in recording the letter of Fanny Walsingham, nor could I venture to do so, were it not for the fact that its publi- cation is absolutely necessary to explain certain circumstances of vital importance to this narrative. I shall be censured in certain quarters for this, and for the publication of many other facts; but, as I have a solemn duty to perform, Ishall proceed with this memoir, without fear or favor.  "My sweet Rose," said Fanny, tracing that name with her pen, "you will wonder that I have not written, ere this, to complain of your absence from town. What you can find at- tractive at Lewisfield, or Dean Hall, is quite a mystery. Are you studying botany?  I must confess that I would rather botanize in a ball-room, among the belles and beaux, than in the fields among the buttercups and balsams. I entreat you, then, to return to Afton. If you knew the anxiety of young Anson Ball, and his rival, Delancy Izard, you would 'fly away home,' like the lady-bird. Julia Livingston says that you have triumphed over the 'proud set' from B. to Z.* * Miss Walsingham makes a mistake in attributing this saying to Miss Livingston. To understand the allusion, it is necessary to relate the anecdote. Mrs. Bee and Mrs. Izard accompanied their husbands to Philadelphia, when Congress convened in that city, and being   54         ROSE MLTON: Apropos, speaking of these Cupidons reminds me of - young friend of theirs. Do you remember a gentleman who paid me so much attention at Mrs. Bethune's, that Bessy Beaufain said, 'There's another Richmond in the field?' which made me laugh, for his name is not Richmond, but Richard. But I suppose that you have forgotten the party to whicr I allude, and all the fun and frolic which kept us up until day began. to break. And, in truth, I must confess I would have forgotten it too, but for one or two witty things which were whispered to me by a certain young gentleman. These so clearly indicated the object he had in view that I pretended not to comprehend him, and endeavored to repulse him in every way that a lady may repel a gentleman whom she does not actually hate. But, you will ask, did she love him? No; not at first, for he had been equally attentive to half a dozen others, and I believed that he was pursuing the same game with me. What was I to do? I could not be rude, and I would not compromise my dignity. Tie only prudent course left me, therefore, was not to hurt his feelings, and yet preserve my pride; in other words, I had to use the tact which men attribute to our sex. Not that I desired to win him: not that I was ambitious of seeing him at my feet; but because I believed that at heart he was imbued with the noblest impulses, which, if properly directed, would lead to splendid results. The more I saw of him, the more I was impressed with this opinion of his cha- racter. It was in consequence of this opinion that I humored him at one time, and repulsed him at another, but without vio- lating the proper dignity of my character. In truth, the course I adopted was the only one by which I could hope to retain his regards, without leading him to hope that his suit would be successful. He said that my conduct was heartless; highly commended for their polished manners, "Oh, yes," said Mrs. Bache, the daughter or grand-daughter of Dr. Franklin, "but they are all a proud set, from B. to Z."   A ROMANCE.           55 but what right has any gentleman to appropriate me to him- self? Is a young lady to have no opinion, no option, no heart for herself? If it were otherwise, a lover might well say to the object of his affections, as a certain man said to his wife, ' What's yours is mine, and what's mine is my own.' But I shall not attempt to deny, my sweet Rose, that what began in friendship has ended in love. Indeed7 as things now stand, I am more attached to him than if I had loved him from the first. You will be pained to learn that he is seriously ill-. almost insane, according to Mr. Hamilton-in consequence of my reproving him for some too loving: speech at Mr. Lans- downe's. He left the party like one distracted, implored some acquaintance to shoot him, and is now confined to his room, deranged, distracted, nay, mad. This induced Mr. Hamilton to call on me this evening, who implored me to save the life of his friend by, saying that I had not utterly discarded him. I was taken so much by surprise, and really was so much affected by the cruel intelligence, that I felt my heart bleeding for its idol. -What was I to do? If I really loved him, why not? But let me come to the point. I gave permission to Mr. Hamilton to reveal the secret of my passion for his friend. I scarcely knew what I said. I felt bewildered. It occurred to me that,.if he died, I should, at heart, be guilty of his death. In this bewildered condition, and overcome by the touching eloquence of his advocate, I granted the permission, as I haye said. In a moment I would have given worlds to recall my words, but in that moment Mr. Hamilton was gone. Gone to tell Mr. Plantagenet that Fanny Walsingham was wooed and won! What am I to do? I know, because I feetl that I have been indiscreet. You must advise me in this difficulty. I entreat you to come to town without delay. I am con- vinced that a net will be thrown over me-not by Mr. Plan- tagenet, or his friends-and without your assistance, I shall be compromised, if not destroyed. You know the scandal of   56         ROSE MLTON: Afton, and I need say no more than that I am ever your affectionate, "FANNY WALSINGHAM." She sealed this letter very carefully, and having superscribed it in a neat legible hand-I mention this for the benefit of the sex generally-she placed it carefully among her papers, closed her desk, and stole up to her chamber. Her maid; Silvy, was nodding over the fire with a cat in her lap, but the cat was only napping, for she raised' her head as Fanny approached, and stared with both her eyes, as if wondering what was the row at that time of the night. But, having conducted our fair young friend into her chamber, politeness bids-us to pause, and close the door, which we shall do accordingly, stating merely that, with the aid of Silvy, our fair friend soon ma- naged to be in the way that ladies like who love their beds-- namely-sound asleep. CHAPTER VI. TE morning after his interview with Miss Walsingham, I received a note from Hamilton, stating that a friend or two of himself and family, were to dine with him, and requesting that I would join them on the occasion. I had previously deter- mined to pass the day with Plantagenet, but, knowing that Hamilton desired to consult with me about our friend's affairs, I accepted his invitation, and entered his drawing-room at the hour appointed. I was exceedingly surprised to find a number of persons, ladies and gentlemen, assembled; for, besides Hamilton and his sister, there were Robert Wharncliffe, and his sister Oc- tavia; Mary Washington, Hortensia Wayne, Isabella ITuntly,   A ROMANCE.            57 and Paulina Argyle, the granddaughter of Mad Archy Camp- bell,* who was cousin to Smart Archy, and Crazy Archy; this last being the person who captured Col. Isaac Hayne at Mr. Ford's, during the revolutionary war. The gentlemen present on the occasion, if my memory serves me, were, Henry Godolphin, Hugh Saton Legrange, Talbbt Shrewsbury, and Robert Wharncliffe i Hamilton has been sufficiently described in these pages, and if any more details are necessary to make up his picture, he must furnish them himself, for which many opportunities will be afforded him, before the conclusion of this history. The first persons whom I encountered on entering the drawing-room, were Henry Godolphin and Aubrey Beauclerk, who were engaged in discussing the merits of Collins' "History of John of Gaunt," and to me they appealed whether that celebrated character was, or was not, given up to Jack Straw and Wat Tyler. Their earnestness-amused me not a little; in fact, they were enthu- siasts, but so opposite in their natures, that no two men were ever more dissimilar; the one being all imagination, the other all mind, if I may be allowed to draw a distinction between these attributes, for I do not dispute the doctrine of! Johnson, that imagination is mind in action; but that it may be more truly called the creative power-that is, imagination gives us something where nothing previously existed; whereas, accord- ing to the definition which has been so very generally received, * The following anecdote is told of Mad Archy. He went to a parson's, accompanied by a young lady, who appeared to be alarmed, and calling for the reverend gentleman to come out, asked to be mar- ried to the lady. The minister hesitating, Mad Archy produced a, brace of pistols, and swore that he should marry them, or suffer death; consequently, the marriage ceremony was performed. But it was a case of abduction, the lady stating to her friends that she had never promised to marry him, or intended to do so, not consenting ex- cept when terrified. This lady, Paulina Phelp, was the grand- mother of Paulina Argyle. 6  \   68         ROSE MLTON:- it merely propels something already in existence. The .one, therefore, was a genius, the other not. The one all imagina- tion, the other all calculation. The one a poet, the other a statesman; and if judged according to- the rules adduced by Lord Bacon, would give to each a fame as lasting as time; but in a degree as ir asunder as the 1&S. "'Founders and uniters of states and cities, lawgiveraxtirpers of tyrants, fathers of the people, and other eminent persons in civil merit," says Baao n, 'were honored but with- the titles of worthies or demi-gods; such as were Hercules, Theseus, Minos, Romulus, and the like; on the other side, such as were -inventors and authors of new arts, endowments, and commodities towards man's life, were ever consecrated amongst the gods-themselves; as were Ceres, Bacchus,- Mercurius, Apollo, and 'others; and justly, for the-merit of the former is confined within the circles of an age or a nation, and is like fruitful showers, which, though 'they be profitable and good, yet serve but for that season, and for a latitude of ground where they fall; but the other is, indeed, like the benefits of heaven, which are perma- nent and universal. The former, again, is mixed with strife and perturbation, but the latter hath the true character of divine presence." Henry Godolphin was entirely a poet, a character as far above the common herd of mankind as an eagle, towering in his pride of place, is above the cozmmon cocks of the barnyard. He seemed ever conscious of his superiority, as if a certain di- vine presence guarded his spirit from contact with the working world, and that his mission was to elevate and advance the great cause of humanity. He felt this, and he gave full sway to his feelings, by attacking every existing political institution in the world, and calling the people to repentance, like the voice in the wilderness. This is the true mission of poetry, and to effect this, the Almighty has breathed into the poet the breath of life. In his person, Godolphin was strikingly handsome, being   A ROMANCE.            59 elegantly formed, but his eyes gave at a single glance the his- tory of his life; and cold must that heart have been that did not feel warmer for a beam from those glorious eyes. He-was young, not more than twenty-five, but with a certain air of maturity that made him equally the companion of the old and the young; in fact, it was among the old that he was mostly es- teemed, the maturity of his mind and the themes which engaged his attention, placing him entirely in a world above the young men of his own age. But there were exceptions, and among these were Hamilton, Beauclerk, Shrewsbury, and Legrange, who were each distinguished for some peculiar accomplishment or characteristic. Aubrey Beauclerk was, as I have said, a statesman, if the term can be properly applied to- one so youthful. But a seat in Congress had placed him in the familiar society of the ablest men, made him conversant with the great affairs of state, and our systems of co-ordinate governments. If I add that, without being a man of genius, he was possessed of the most brilliant and extraordinary talents, I shall have suffi- ciently described a character who is identified with the political history of the country. I had scarcely recovered from the surprising question put to me by Godolphin and Beauclerk, when another remark was addressed to me, and, turning, I encountered Hugh Swinton Legrange, who was standing in front of Isabella Huntly, that, with a tongue as sweet as Bblial, was destined by her officious. ness to bring a great deal of misery on some of my dearest friends. But she was a good conversationalist, like most of her sex, and had been tilting with Legrange, who was also good in that line. In fact, Legrange was a very accomplished man, a good writer and speaker in the most copious meaning of those words; he was able, at the very moment I have in- troduced him to your notice, to exercise any office, and execute the most complicated affairs, with the head and hand of a master. He is now dead, and I may speak of him without   60         ROSE MLTON: reserve. That he had faults, and very great ones, I shall not deny; but if we pardon his vanity on account of his many and various virtues, I know not but that he may be placed among the worthies who have enriched our language with their works, and adorned the nation with their eloquence and excellence. Some allusion to his personal appearance may not be inappro- priate. He was below the medium height, strongly built, but so disproportioned that his legs were very short, and his arms very long. It was this length of arms that gave him such ad- vantage in his oratorical displays, for Demosthenes never studied the art of oratory with more care and assiduity than did Legrange. His head was large and handsomely formed; his hair abundant and black, and brushed smartly forward, meeting a very large pair of black whiskers, which ran round his face, but not disguising the chin, which was round and full, and in admirable keeping with his mouth; this last giving the character to his face, particularly the upper lip. -If to these I add that his nose was slightly Roman, his eyes black and bright, and his eyebrows abundant, the reader will have a de- scription sufficiently accurate.* The evil genius to whom he had been discoursing about "Grimke and the classics," was one of those evening belles whose sweetest music is a little piece of scandal. As Isabella Huntly is destined, unfortunately, to play no very insignificant part in the following drama, it is necessary that I describe her somewhat minutely, begging pardon of the sex for my partjcu- * Having introduced this gentleman, I cannot resist the temptation of recording the following anecdote which occurred some years ago at Washington. "Who is Mr. Legrange, that Col. H. wants me to send as charg6 to Belgium?" asked Gen. Jackson of one whom we shall call N. "He is one of our ripest scholars," replied N., "and is a great reviewer; indeed, some people think that he is almost, if not quite, equal to Mr. Edward Everett." "Mr. who ." asked Gen. Jackson in astonishment. "Mr. Edward Everett," replied N., meekly. "Well," said the old general, "I never thought much of him!"   A ROMANCE.           61 larity. But from this pardon I expressly exclude the women's rights women, who are apt to be a little too particular them- selves; indeed, one might well wonder how they acquired some things they seem to know very well indeed. The gentle Isabellatad just escaped her teens, and had commenced with the twenties, as if she intended to go right through them, for she never permitted anything to turn her aside from a project in hand; and as the twenties had come to her hands inma way that she could not well avoid them, she made the most of necessity, and determined to patronize them. "Who would be a chit-that age of bread and butter!" and the fair Isabel would toss her head in high disdain.. She made it a rule never to praise any one, or, if she did, to qualify it in such a way, that her praise sounded very much like censure, for she duly appreciated and appropriated the saying of Pope, and without sneering taught the rest to sneer. In her earliest youth, when a school girl at Miss Dalty's, she had caused the dismissal of'Emma Auckland, by the sly innuendoes she circulated against that young lady; and more recently, she had been chiefly in- strumental in breaking off two matrimonial engagements, the one between Ida Mornington and Bull Middleton, and the other between Virginia Granville and Gordon Somerset, the brother of Emily, who is mentioned in the memoirs of Henry Lexington. Indeed, she could not lives without excitement, but unfortunately the requisite fuel consisted in bearing false witness against her neighbor. It must be confessed, lfwever, that Isabella Huntly was a very entertaining companion, for she was sprightly, quick to perceive and comprehend, and pos- sessed a certain social or colloquial eloquence, that would please all who lingered in her presence, or listened to her conversa- tion. In society, and out of it too, she was a consummate artist. Many men imagine that women are to be judged by appearances; but the art of woman consists in appearing art- less, and there is nothing so deceitful, in all this world, as a very innocent looking woman. The "mouth of such a woman 6*   62         ROSE MLTON: is like a deep pit," and the quicker you scamper away from the pit the better will it be for you, and for your immortal soul. The other ladies present appeared to avoid the presence of Miss Huntly, particularly Hortensia Wayne, who wAs a mil- lionaire, and therefore a young lady of great hauteur, but Mary Washington seemed to enjoy a good thing from Isabella Huntly with great delight, her good'temper being proof against the poisoned shaft. As to Paulina Argyle, she left no doubt of her being a lineal descendant of Mad Archy Pampbell, for she recited the cat's address to the cook, and then told the anecdote of the widow who wanted a husband. For the dinner, it was like all other dinners in Afton,'ex- cept that there was not quite so much drinking of wine as in the days of King'James, when it was nothing uncommon to see Burgundy overcoming Scotland-good King Jamie being a three bottle man. The board of Hamilton was, however, a sumptuous one, and we all did justice to it; and when I say all, I mean the gentlemen, for the ladies ate little or nothing; in fact, I used to wonder, in those days, if the fair sex lived on anything stronger than love and poetry. It was in consequence of this belief that I was quoting a verse or two* for Mary Washington, hoping that a word fitly spoken would be like "apples of gold in pictures of silver," when Legrange called to know what I was saying that interested my companion so much. *  - "Nay," said I, "it is for. you to say something on this theme. We are speaking about Lord Byron. What is said in Europe about his separation from his wife?" "Those who know the parties intimately," replied Legrange, "do not blame Byron. 'How could it be expected,' as Lady Charlottei Ftzgerald said to me on one occasion; 'how could it be expected that such a union would end well, where one was all imagination, and the other all calculation?' What   A ROMANCE.           63 seemed most unjustifiable was the hypocrisy towards Byron, who had no idea of what was going to happen." "The truth is," said Godolphin, "that Lady Byron did not understand Lord Byron; and, indeed, I have heard it said that Lady Byron was one of the dullest persons in the world. Now, I cannot imagine how any one with a soul-and that soul a poet's-could brook the daily impertinence of a dunce, who, because she is a woman, expects that a man should sacri- fice all his pride to gratify her idle whims and humors; mak- ing himself, in fact, the meanest creature in the world, -instead of being the first and foremost. Hence the unhappiness of poets, and, regarding the examples of^?Milton and Byron, I would say that poets should never marry." "Take care what you say," remarked Isabella Huntly, "those are dangerous sentiments for a young gentleman, and poets are nothing but men after all." "It is' because he is man," replied Godolphin, "that I would have him learn to venerate himself. Surely, a man was made for something better than to be a slave. I care not if he stoop to man or woman, for the simple act of stooping makes him subservient, and he who is so can never be inde- pendent." "But," said Mary Washington, "love itself is homage." "Granted," replied Godolphin; "but I do not speak of love, but of marriage, which is a very different thing. Love expands the imagination, but marriage contracts it." "I would suggest," said Hamilton, " that marriage wounds, but does not contract the imagination." "Mr. Hamilton," said Miss Argyle, "what do you mean by wound?" "Yes," quoth Miss Wayne, "do, pray, let us hear your explanation." "You see," said Mortimer Shrewsbury, "talk of marriage, and the sex is in arms."   "        ROSE MLTON.: ' To arms, cried Mortimer!" exclaimed Beauclerk, quoting from Gray's 3Bard the war cry of old Edmund de Mortimer. "I am glad to find,' said Godolphin, "that Gray is not for- gotten yet. His odes are perfect gems, and I regret that the great Aristarch of England did not rate them more highly." "It is but recently," replied'Legrange, for Godolphin had addressed the latter portion of his remarks to that gentleman, that I have read Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets,' for the first time. He is a horribly bad writer.' His artificial periods, and his pomposity of phrase, to express the baldest commonplace, are insupportable to me. Yet his criticism, in everything that does not soar abole a certain height, is usually very sen- sible. For the sublime or the pathetic, he had neither soul nor ear to comprehend them. Nothing can be more unworthy of the mighty theme than his way of treating Milton, except his superficial notes on Shakspeare. From his praise of Pope's Homer as a translation-his significant insinuation that the best scholars have more'pleasure in reading the 'blind old man' so perverted, than in his own matchless verse-and his absurd remarks on 'Samson Agonistes,' and Greek tragedy, I shrewdly suspect the doctor was no Greek scholar at all; nay, I am sure of it. Latin, I dare say, he knew to a certain ex- tent, prosody especially, but for deep learning he had none. His talent is colloquial-ingenious argument, quick turns of thought; ready, pointed, witty repartee, clothed frequently in metaphor, which looks like reasoning, and does often bear. a great abundance of maxims and moralities, uttered with oracu- lar solemnity, even when rather trivial; and withal a taste for elegance, though false, and a lively, but not a sublime fancy-- these qualities, aided by very considerable and various litera- ture, and by an invincible confidence in himself, and a most dogmatical superciliousness in regard to other people, account for his prodigious celebrity in that day of talkers and clubs, and will secure to him a certain reputation with posterity. But he is in his true element when he speaks of Dryden.   A ROMANCE.            65 Milton was above his pitch. He had not as much heart ws head, and not as much soul as heart, and is never either very original or very profound." "I regret," replied Godolphin, " that you rate Dr. Johnson so low, particularly on account of his criticisms orf Pope's HEomer. William Gifford, who certainly stands at the head of modern critics-at least since Johnson's time.-pronounces the translation of Pope to be superior,-in many portions, to Homer, and Byron states, with great truth and justice, that Pope has made a beautiful English poem out-of a sublime Greek one. The notes on Shakspeare were designed to accom- pany the plays, and are, therefore, short and to the purpose; but for Johnson's opinion of Shakspeare, and for a just criti- cism on his powers and poems, we must go to his CPreface to Shakspeare,' which overthrows all the objections to the want of the unities, which the critics had denounced as violating the established rules of the drama. Now, surely, the writer who  could defend the truth, the nature, and the versatile powers of Shakspeare, was able 'to pitch'-pardon me, Legrange, for borrowing your phrase-himself into the learning of Milton. Dr. Johnson did not enter into a critical examination of Milton, because the subject had been exhausted by Addison, and, in- deed, Johnson alludes to this fact in the CRambler.' He had the prudence to abstain from placing himself in competition with the monarch of criticism, and it is this prudence, which is but another name for judgment, that I so much admire in Johnson. But you talk of Homer and the CIliad.' Now, if authority is of any importance, we must believe that there was no such poet as Homer at all.* This; we all know, was .the * In Moore's Diary for 1818, occurs the following passage: "The doctor (Parr) was glorious, often very eloquent, always odd; said there was no such man as Homer; that there were various poems tacked together by a collector, oNpeo (Homer)-that this was now thegeneral opinion of the learned."-Vide Memoirs of Moore, No. 3, p. 200.          .   "        ROSE MLTON: pinion of Dr. Parr, the greatest name in English classical literature of the present century. Where has Johnson said anything apparently more absurd of Homer than this opinion of Dr. Parr? No! It is not Johnson who is absurd, but the tide which bore such men as Southey and Wordsworth into power, that has turned against Johnson as well as Pope; ani we have even Tom Moore ridiculing Pope's poetry as sing-saong But I have no fears for Johnson, when he is firfly judged. He that is in his true element when sporting wit. the Swan of Avon, need apprehend no dangers in encountering the poet of -Paradise. It is not my purpose to 'compare Shakspeare and Milton, but all the art of the one and artlessness of the other. Who ever, put down Shakspeare to take up Milton? and yet Milton is above the- pitch of that critic whose vindication of the dramas of Shakspeare is one of the ablest defences in the language. But you object to Johson's style. Now, where will you find a collection of criticisms more simple in style than the 'Lives of the Poets?' and, regarded as critical canons, they are the great guns of our literature. They form a body of laws, that constitute a literature in themselves." "Perhaps no work has ever been more generally read and admired," said Shrewsbury; "but the current of public opinion has been strongly setting against some of its tenets. What do you regard the best prose piece of the day?" "Do you mean as a critique?' asked Godolphin. "Yes, replied Shrewsbury, "a critique." "Lord Byron's letter on the 'Pope and Bowles contro- versy,' is, in my estimation, the best piece of criticism that has appeared since the 'Lives of the Poets.' The principle he inculcates, that art beautifies nature, is the true one-the sculptor selecting from a dozen persons the several proportions for a single statue; a sail on the sea; even an old boat on the shore, are some of the artificial adjuncts, showing that nature, simply without art, is not so powerful or picturesque. The instance, too, of the ancient warriors, blazing in their artifiial   A ROMANCE.            67 armor, and of two modern boxers, in their nakedness, is well put, and would impress us with the belief that art, like cus- tom, is more powerful than nature. If you admit the influence of custom on -our, habits, you must admit the impression of art on our minds." "But does not this contradict your opinion of Shakspeare, who is called, par excellence, the poet of nature?" "Not at all," replied Godolphin, "he is called the poet of nature because he never violates nature. In discarding the old rules of the unities, handed down from Sophocles and Euri- pides, he supplied their place by inserting new ones, and this invention of itself is sufficient to place Shakspeare among the artists, and at the head of the modern dramatists. His inven- tion consisted in combining the comic and the tragic muse in the same poetic piece; hence his dramas are truer transcripts of society than the system of iEschylus." "There is no reading I like so well as Shakspeare's," said Beauclerk, "but as acting plays, I must confess that I have seen better." "In fact," replied Godolphi), "if we are to apply to dra- mas the rule adopted by Charles Fox, as to speeches, one must condemn Shakspeare entirely. Lord Erskine tells us that Fox used to ask of a speech, ' Does it read well?' 'Yes.' 'Then it was not a good speech. " "Apropos," said Legrange; " talking of speeches reminds me of a good one. William-Schlegel once told me that Philip IV., of Spain, used to recite verses with Calderon, who had a won- derful facility at improvisation. They were doing n auto, in which Philip was God, and the poet, Adam. The latter had the parole, and kept it an unconscionably long time, until the' Creator, becoming impatient, interrupts him by saying: 'Yes, I am your creator; and I repent me already of having made such a garrulous fellow."' "Talking of garrulous fellows," said Wharneliffe, "reminds me of Edmund Burke. It was said of him, that after speak-       i   68         ROSE MLTON: ing for hours in the House of Commons, le would repair to the Literary Club, and endeavor to talk down every man, one after another. But, then, what a talker! He was of such large materials, that some one said you might have carved Gibbon out of a corner of Burke's mind, without the piece being missed." "What do you think," said I to Shrewsbury, who was a wit, "of Burke's pun on the divine right of kings and toast- makers-the jure de ving "' Capital!" exclaimed Shrewsbury, holding up a glass filled with wine, and gazing at it with delight; and now permit me to give the toast of Teddy the Tiler. Are you all filled? Well, 'here's to ould Ireland; her cup of misery has been overflowing for centuries, and is not yet full!'" CHAPTER VII. THE last remarks having caused the introduction of politics, I escaped from the room and joined the ladies, who were as actively engaged at their politics. Mrs. Hamilton was the centre of the group, and appeared very much amused with the oddities of Paulina Argyle, for that interesting specimen of the Campbells had the floor on my coming in. I do not remember to have described Miss Argyle's personal appear- ance, and for fear I may not have the leisure to do so again, I shall stsle briefly that she was neither tall nor short, nor fat nor lean, but of a height that became her, and her person just sufficiently full-thanks to bread and butter-to invite the envious eye. But it was Paulina's voice and manner that charmed you; the one had so much gladness in its tone, and the other so much grace in its simplicity. In her higher words, however, when her spirits literally broke loose, and ran   A ROMANCE.           69 away with her, she was indescribable. Everything in a mo- ment, gay, grave, merry and mockish, she bid defiance to all rules, and rattled with every one, as if her will was law, and her pleasure the sole object of society. She was not a beauty, it is true, but Paulina would have carried away the palm from a battalion of them, without a contest, by her man- ners alone, and she welf knew the effect of manners in win- ning the world. Beauty, learning, talent, worth, virtue, are as nothing in the balance when compared to manners-the mys- terious magnetizer of hearts. "They may not call me a beauty," she once said to me; "but if I can once fix the eye, the field is mine." There is more wisdom in this remark than is apt to be imagined, and that. Paulina was wise in the ways of the world I was well aware; the only drawhack to it being her inclination to caricature everybody, and everything; but thebad effect of this she contrived to neutralize, by the absence of malignity in her manners. Such, in a word, was Paulina Argyle, and such, at the age of eighteen years, I present her respectfully to your acquaintance. No words can paint the contrast between Mrs. Hamilton and the vivacious Paulina, for Mrs. Hamilton, though still possessing traces of youth and beauty-and when does a woman ever lose them?-was already advancing to that line where the old folks at home "clasp-hands along the centuries." In truth, she was a fine representative of the old regime-when the old re- gime was something-and her easy, dignified manners, and placid, gentle smile, were not eclipsed by the dashing vivacity of Miss Argyle, the sweet smile of Mary Washington, the aristocratic hauteur of Hortensia Wayne, or the insinuating address of Isabella Huntly. "I am surprised at Charlotte Surry," said Mrs. Hamilton to Paulina Argyle, who had been relating some recent occur- rence at General Beaufain's. "But, then," continued Mrs. Hamilton, "it is so like her mother, whose character was not above suspicion." 7   70         ROSE MLTON: "O!" exclaimed Miss Argyle, delighted to see the little piece of scandal which was peeping out from the remarks of Mrs. Hamilton. a Did Charlotte have a mother? The idea never occurred to me before, for she is one of those persons who appear as if they have existed ever since the creation- they look so odd, And was she fond of dancing, too?" asked Miss Argyle, archly. "Oh, yes," replied Mrs, Hamilton, smiling, "and on one occasion, when a party of us had gone down near the sea, old Bethune asked Louisa Hazleton--that was the maiden name of Charlotte's mother-to dance, but she declined, saying that a sea tick had bit her toe." In telling this precious piece of scandal, the old lady was quite as much amused as any of the girls by whom she was surrounded. It was one of those jokes which, having pleased in youth, go on pleasing forever, and then, besides, it war so spicy that the sex may be excused, for they all love spice-to a man. It was just at this moment that I entered. Paulina Argyle was the first to perceive my approach, and came running up to me, exclaiming:- O", Mr. Lexington! you do not know what you missed by not attending'the party at General'Beaufain's. Where could you have been?" At his rival's," said I, for you'are aware that we have our Montagues and Capulets in Afton. You know, I ima- gine, that we do not live in a free country?" "No," replied Miss Argyle, " for we are slaves in town. But you missed the strangest scene that was ever witnessed!" "What do you mean?" said I, "and who are the actors?" "Why, Miss Cornwallis* and Mr. [Marlborough."  And * Her real name was not Cornwallis. But her father, James Mann, being a near relative of Lord Cornwallis, and having the same family name, dropped his surname, and took that of Cornwallis, as being   A ROMANCE.            71 here Miss Argyle began to mimic Miss Cornwallis, inclining her head, and dying away at the dulcet notes of Mr. Marl- borough. "You know," she continued, suddenly resuming her native air, " that Miss Cornwallis is a sentimentalist, and sings that song of Crouch's:- "I know a lyttle hande, Tys ye softest yn the land- Ande I feel yts pressure blande, Whyle I synge; Lylie white, ande restynge nowe, Lyke a rose leaf on my brow, As a dove myght fanne my browe, Wyth yts wynge. Welle! I 'pryze all hands above- Thys dear hand of herre I love." "But I did not know," said I, when the burst of merriment had subsided, for even Miss Hortensia Wayne condescended to smile, "I did not know that Mr. Marlborough ever indulged in song, for he is a gastronomist." "Why, bless you," cried Miss Argyle, "all singers are great eaters; didn't you know that? I should not be sur- prised if he were to eat up one of us, before long, just as the public singers of old time used to feed on nightingales' tongues. What makes you laugh, Mary?" "What an odd comparison!" said Miss Washington; "do I look like the tongue of a nightingale?" and she actually glanced at her figure, as if trying to trace any resemblance between objects so very dissimilar, "No, my dear," observed Mrs. Hamilton, "but Paulina must have meant that you were as sweet as one." "That reminds me," remarked the lively Miss'Argyle, "what General Delancy Izard said about you the other day." the most potential and patriotic; his -grandfather having been a Tory, and one of the ( addressers" mentioned by Mr. Sabine, of Boston. *    72         ROSE MLTON: "Bless me!" cried Mary Washington, "you've made a mis- take, for he called not on me, but on Hortensia." "Indeed!" exclaimed Miss Argyle, evidently astonished; "did General Izard call on you?" "And why not?" replied the proud millionaire; "because General Delaney Izard gains victories, does that elevate him, who is only a man, to the proud position of a woman?" This speech made my teeth chatter, and turning to Miss Huntly, who was sitting by the fire, wrapped up in her mys- tery-she was at that time a mystery to me, notwithstanding her insinuating conversation-I addressed a word or two to her, touching a letter I had lately seen from her brother, who had been recently appointed the governor of one of the new territories. She requested me to draw my chair close to hers, as she desired to have some conversation with me on a subject which engrossed all her thoughts, and inspired her with no little anxiety. "What in the world," thought I, "can you be after now? But as you are a mystery, you must explain yourself." In obedience to her request, I took a seat by her side, and asked her to explain herself. She commenced by asking me not to be astonished at the question which she was about to put to me, but as there were many rumors afloat, she thought the plan was to satisfy her doubts by applying for in- formation of me, .who must know all about the truth or falsity of the report which had reached her some days ago, touching the fact of Mr. Plantagenet's illness. Was he really ill? I answered that he was. "My reason. for being so very particular is," replied Miss Huntly, "that I have heard it was all a sham, to win the sympathy of Miss Walsingham. You know how very censo- rious thte world is, particularly when one. has been, according to the current rumor, so very ill as your friend. It was only yesterday, Wynford Best told me that Mr. Plantagenet would wake up suddenly, and find himself perfectly restored to health,   A ROMANCE.           73 intimating, in his consoling way, that there was more of ro- mance than reality in his indisposition." And all this was said by Miss Huntly as if she believed every word she was uttering! I had suspected her, some time since, of endeavoring to inquire the character of Plantagenet, by the faint praise she usually bestowed on his motives, and conduct, and sentiments, but why she should select him for the object of her shafts, it was impossible to conceive. He had never made love to her, that I was aware of, nor had he ever treated her with any lack of the deference and courtesy which every gentleman extends to a lady. What, then, could be her motive, and particularly, what was her design, in select- ing me to be the confidante of her suspicions, and of the idle rumors and tattling of society? She must have been wound- ed, thought I, but surely not by Plantagenet! "As to the reports you mention," I said, in reply, " there is not a particle of truth in any of them, for Mr. Plantagenet *is not only ill, but so severely that I fear his temperament, which is exceedingly nervous, will have a struggle to restore him to his friends." "But what I cannot understand is this," interrupted Miss Huntly; " what cause had he for supposing his case a hopeless one in his suit to Fanny Walsingham? for certain circum- stances have come to my knowledge, which leave me little rea- son to doubt that he, like Mr. Middleton, might have been only too successful in that quarter." "In the name of mercy," said I, utterly amazed at the gross insinuation of these remarks, "what do you mean? Is it possible that you intend to throw suspiciolon the character, the virtue, of Miss Walsingham?" "No, I do not," replied Miss Huntly, but with a manner that said plainly enough, but I do though!"I have never," she continued, and her eyes glistened like diamonds, "I have. never seen anything between Mr. Plantagenet and Miss Wal- 7*   74   /     ROSE MLTON: singham that might not be pardoned to the indiscretion of youth, but I have heard certain reports, that should make one suspicious." It was impossible to hear these cruel remarks without actu- ally shuddering. A stain on the virtue of Fanny Walsing- ham! It was impossible-nay, it was infamous; and my face burnt like fire as I replied to the closing remark of Miss Huntly:-- "Who has dared to circulate such a base report? Let me know the villain's name-if it be a man-" "Perhaps," interrupted Miss Huntly, "you are one of those who believe that women are the cause of all the bloodshed in the world?" 'No,'indeed, I am not," said I, for the remark had the effect of restoring me to my temper, which, I regret to say, I had lost, " but this I will say, that be the author of such a re- port man or woman, it is an infamous falsehood." "I applaud your zeal," replied Miss Huntly, "but I sus-. pect that you are prompted more by your friendship for Mr. Plantagenet than your esteem for Miss Walsingham. Is it not so, Mr. Lexington?" "I do not know," said I, "for in cases of this kind I never stop to analyze my feelings; but this I do know, that the sen- timents I have uttered spring from a heart whose chief attri- bute is devotion to the honor of your sex; and I cannot, nor will I believe, that the injurious reports you have mentioned were suggested, or first put in circulation, by a woman." "I really muat thank you for the gallant speech you have just uttered," retied Miss Huntly; "'and I am half inclined  to tell you something more-" "What! against the honor of Miss Walsingham? No! do not--.keep it away-anywhere; but do not hope to make me believe that this sweet girl is guilty of crime." "If you will but listen to me," said Miss Huntly, putting her hand on my arm, "I will satisfy you on that point. It   I         A ROMANCE.           75 was not to suggest othler reasons for the criminality of Miss Walsingham, that I desired to tell you something more on this subject." This remark had something in it so mysterious, so like Isa- bella Huntly, that I looked fixedly into her eyes for some time, endeavoring to trace from their expression the meaning of her words. But her eyes were impassable. Indeed, they were so peculiar, that I have often regarded them as a study. The moment she saw my earnest gaze, she threw a deadness into her eyes, or a sort of film over it, like a bird, and in- stantly they were as blank as if their lids had been closed. I have met with a few men who had this singular power, but Miss Huntly was the only woman who was gifted with it, her sex generally trusting to disguise their sentiments by simplicity of manneri In fact, it may be asserted, generally, that the more simple and innocent a woman appears to be, the more shy and scheming she is. I do not make this remark in a churlish spirit, but having had much dealing with the belle sex, I am bound to tell the truth, and the whole truth, even at the expense of a little indiscretion, for the whole life of wo- man is diplomacy, iawhich the head is all, the heart nothing. I know this sounds like treason, but then, truth to tell, a little treason, now'and then, is rather beneficial to the common- wealth. But to resume.  "I cannot imagine what more you can tell me," said I, "and what you have already told me is so injurious to the honor of Miss Walsingham, that I should prefer not hearing any more scandal." "You mistake my meaning," replied Miss IIuntly; "it is not my intention to dilate on those reports, but I desire to free myself from blame, by stating to you from whence I heard these scandals, as you call them, and you will be very much. surprised to learn that they were told me by a gentle- man."? "A gentleman!"I exclaimed; "no, Miss Huntly, do not   76         ROSE MLTON: degrade the name-a gentleman is a man of honor and of honesty. No gentleman'can traduce a lady." "Perhaps not," she replied, "but on that point I may per- haps differ with you, for"there are gentlemen who do not con- sideri it inconsistent with honor or with honesty, to degrade a woman from her proper sphere in life, and, perhaps, disgrace her with his patronage." Her eyes actually flashed fire as she said this, and I could not help acknowledging by a bow, the justness of her bitter remark; and doubly bitter it was, coming, as it did, in a tone of mockery that was gall and wormwood. "You really have excited my curiosity to such a degree," said I, "that I must ask you to tell me who-what man-has been base enough to communicate these reports to you? I know very well that my request is impertinent, but then you must be aware that, Miss Walsingham has a father who will certainly pursue this affair until he has traced the author. I have but to utter a word, and the name must be revealed, and you know it." "I do not know what you will think of my prudence," said Miss Huntly, "but the name of thegentleman who told me these reports touching the criminal charater of Miss Walsing- ham, is no other than Mr. William Cavendish." "Cavendish I Are you sure, Miss Huntly, that Mr. Caven- dish told you these base scandals?' "I am quite sure that he told me these reports," replied Miss Huntly; but as to their being base scandals, that's quite another part of speech. You may discredit them, Imay not." ' He is base enough,'" said I, "to perform the meanest actions, for he is a sort of human scavenger, that lives on the filth of the human shambles. I shall fly to him, and ascertain what it is he says about Miss Walsingham, and Mr. Plan- tagenet." "Hold!" cried Miss Iuntly, "not Mr. Plantagenet. There was no word mentioned of him to me. It was Bay Middleton." aC   A ROMANOE.           " But I was already out of the room, my blood being on fire with the resolution of hastening at once to Cavendish's house; but hearing the voice of Hamilton as he took leave of his guests, I paused until they had passed into the street, and then entered to him, for the purpose of learning the result of his interview with Miss Walsingham, and of communicating mine with Miss Huntly. CHAPTER VIII. "Now that we have a moment to ourselves," observed Hamilton, "let us retire to my library, and confer about the affair which we have in hand." We therefore left the dining room, and entered the neat little study, which Hamilton had fitted up at the back of his princely residence. After carefully locking the door to ex- clude the possibility of being interrupted, he continued as follows:- "You were no doubt surprised to find so large a company with me on your arrival to dinner, but the truth is, this is my mother's day, and I had entirely forgotten it when I was dispatching my invitation, or else I would have deferred our conference to a more seasonable moment." "Nothing could have been more opportune than your invita- tion," said I in reply, "for it has afforded me the chance of making a discovery which will astonish you more than any- thing you ever heard in all your life." "To what do you allude?" asked Hamilton, surprised at the earnestness of my manner; "what discovery have you made? Has this affair between Miss Walsingham and Plan- tagenet taken wind?" "Tell me first the result of your interview with Miss Wal-   78         ROBS MLTON: singham," I replied, "and then I shall relate the discovery which is likely to involve us still deeper in this affair." Hamilton now recounted to me the incidents of his inter- view with Miss Walsingham; which was even more fruitful of results than I had hoped, notwithstanding my confidence in the tact, sagacity, and skill of my friend, and my firm reliance on the good sense and native dignity of Miss Walsingham. How many girls, under similar circumstances, would have re- pulsed the overture of PlantagenetI but I could not give Hamilton too much credit for his diplomacy in effecting his object without exciting the suspicion of Miss Walsingham, that he represented Mr. Plantagenet, without the authority of that gentleman. Tact! call it by what name we like, ridicule it as we may, there is nothing like tact after all, in bending the bow of human happiness, or in moulding-the mind of men and women by the plastic hand of the thing called manners. It is, in truth, the "action," so much insisted on by Demos- thenes, carried into private life, and forming and transforming us as if by magic. What would have been the determination of Miss Walsingham, if she had suspected the whole truth, it is useless to imagine; but I may state that, in affairs of love, we have been permitted, since the Fall of Man, to practise a little pardonable deception on the sex, by way of retribution and retaliation. "But have you communicated the fact of your interview with Miss Walsingham to Plantagenet? I would in your place have gone at once to him after leaving Miss Walsingham." G"No," replied Hamilton, "I avoided doing that, particu- larly on account of Plantagenet's condition, which required Test and sleep; to disturb-him, therefore, at such a time, would have caused a revulsion; and a relapse, you know, is always dangerous. But the reason of my wishing to see you here was, that we might arrange our plans touching this business, for some little address is necessary." "The difficulty which we have now to surmount," said I,   A ROMANCs.             79 "is the discovery which I have just made, and which I fear will disconcert all our arrangements. Have you heard any reports lately?" "Reports! what reports? Is there any rumor, of this affair in the city?" "'In a word," said I, "there is some evil genius at work, and it is absolutely necessary that we try and counteract it at once," and I here recounted all that Miss Huntly had told me, particularly that portion of her conversation relating to the -scandalous rumor about Miss Walsingham and- Mr. Bay Mid- dleton, which she mentioned as coming to her directly from Mr. Cavendish. It is impossible to describe the anger and emotion of Hamil- ton during this recital. Bred as he had been to the profes. sion of arms, he frequently put his hand to his side, as if in the act of drawing his sword to cut down the malicious slan- derer. "I see it all!" he exclaimed, springing from his chair and pacing to and fro, "I see it all! This is in revenge for her rejection of his suit, and' he is determined to destroy the gem he could not win. But thank God! there is a spark of chi- valry still burning bright in the South, and that spark shall explode this infernal plot. We must go at once to Cavendish's; we have no time to spare! for, after my interview with Miss Walsingham last evening, I feel that I am a party to this cause, and that I must defend her at the hazard of my life." "But is it not necessary," said I, "before we go to Caven- dish's that we inform her father of the report? We might see him on the way, as his house is situated between yours and Cavendish's." "No," replied Hamilton, "'not for the world! I could not speak to him about it; my tongue would cleave to the roof of my mouth; but I shall drop him a note on the subject, and leave him free to act as he chooses on the subject." And throwing himself into a chair, Hamilton dashed off %   80         ROSE MLTON: letter to Mr. Walsingham, the very commas of which looked like inverted broadswords. This note was immediately dis- patched by the hands of a servant, and my carriage being ready, we jumped in, and the next moment were rattling along Mazyckborough at speed. But Nassau, who was driving, mis- conceiving the orders of Hamilton, took us away off to Noi- sette's garden, so that we lost at least a precious hour, when every minute was of so much importance; for if once a report so scandalous was bruited about the city, where would the con- sequences end? Not one, two, three, four, or five persons only would be involved, but as many families; perhaps a large por- tion of the community would be in arms, as if a civil war was raging within the confines of Afton. It was absolutely neces- sary, therefore, to crush this scandal in the bud, and it was with no little solicitude for the result of our visit, that I crossed the threshold of William Cavendish; the door being open, we walked in without causing our names to be announced. But on arriving at the head of the stairs, from the banquette, we met Cavendish's servant, who informed us that his master had left home the night previous, and had not returned. This news perplexed us. Where could Cavendish have gone? It is true that his usual resort was to the gambling salooni of the city; but as he was playing for higher stakes than usual, it would be useless to seek him in his accustomed places of retreat and recreation; it was necessary then to seek him elsewhere. "I should not be astonished if he has stolen home without the knowledge of his servant," said Hamilton, "and I shall satisfy my doubts on the subject." He accordingly thrust the servant aside, and entered successively every apartment in the spacious and splendid mansion of Cavendish, who was a man of great wealth; being, like Lansdowne, "spacious in the pos- session of dirt." But the object of his search was not forth- coming, and we concluded to drive to Plantagenet's, for the purpose of concerting some-plan of proceedings; for doubtless   A ROMANOE.           81 Cavendish, the inventor of the scandal, was busily engaged in disseminating it through the city. We drove rapidly, there- fore, from Cannonsbtrgh; but, in passing the bridge, one of the horses stumbled over a cow, and broke the pole. This put a stop to our progress for some time, but Judge Richardson, who spied the accident from his garden, and coming himself to learn its nature, caused his own carriage pole to be substituted for mine; and after this delay, we once more proceeded on our journey. We had not proceeded very far before Nassau turned into Bull Street; everybody knows what Bull Street was in those days! Indeed, it was well named, for it was the great tho- roughfare of all the cows, in all the neighborhood, that daily sought the bos recumbit of Harlston's Green. Alas! what associations rise up at the mention of that old green, when in our green youth we witnessed those combats which made that old green our "Flander scene.'. How many pitched battles have I witnessed there between the " genteel boys" and " the blackguards." Who can forget the hurrah that went upwhen George Campbell floored his man, finishing him at a single blow between the eyes? Oh, those were days! Or who can- not remember when William Clawes had his flat' nose knocked flatter still by a blow that made him bloom like a red, red rose? "Oh, 'the days that we have seen!" But we must leave these interesting historical details to some future Elia, who shall immortalize the Tips and Tames of Afton, sweet Afton, as he of Lincoln's Inn did his old cronies of the India House, after the explosion of the famous South Sea bubble. What a world this is to youth! and what a world it is to him who looks back, and recalls the heroes of the battle-green! It was in Bull Street that another accident occurred, for when we were just between Gourdin's and Clarkson's, a band of musicians who were proceeding to Poinsett's Gardens sud- denly struck up a march, which as suddenly caused my horses to strike up a run; nor did they stop until they had knocked 8     82.        ROSE MLTON: the carriage to pieces at the house of Major James Hamilton, who then resided at the corner, and who very politely tendered his -own carriage to convey us into towh. He will, perhaps, remember, should these pages ever meet his eye, the accident here mentioned; and 'I here take this occasion once again to renew to him the assurance of the high esteem I entertain for. his temper, talents, and character. However much inclined to accept his offer, we determined to walk down, taking our way through George into King Street, leaving Nassau with the horses, and as much of the carriage as could be seen; the rest of it having evaporated in honor of old Poinsett, who had just defeated Gedes in a contest for Congress. CHAPTER IX. IT ras the close of evening when we arrived at Plantage- net's, and sent up our names by the servant who answered our summons at the door. He returned shortly afterwards, stating that his master was too ill to see us, and' requesting that we would call the next day. This message was so very strange, and so unlike Plantagenet, that we could scarcely credit the servant; but he assured us that he had only repeated his mas- ter's words, strange as they were. But we had determined to see him, and see him we would, in spite of his refusal; and, going up the staircase, tapped for admittance at his chamber door. We could distinctly hear voices in conversation; but the nature of the dialogue we were unable to determine, the door being closed. In a little time, the hum of voices died away; a door was shut violently, and then, for the first time, we heard the voice of Plantagenet asking, "Who's there?" "You. must open the door," said I; "for here are Hamilton and myself, very anxious to see you,"   A ROMANCE.           83 The next moment the door was opened by Plantagenet him- self, and we entered the chamber. I was shocked at the appearance of Plantagenet; he had not changed his dress since we saw him last, and there was a wildness about his eyes that indicated the dreadful condition of his nervous system. "How are you, Plantagenet?" said Hamilton, taking his hand and speaking to him affectionately. "Why, how did you expect to find me?" asked Plantagenet. "The servant said that you were too ill to'receive us," re- plied Hamilton; " but I have such important matter to com- municate to you that Lexington and myself resolved to' see you, in spite of your denial." "I feel highly honored by your visit," replied Plantagenet, dryly; " but I am at a loss to conceive the nature of the com- munication which you have to make." Hamilton rose from his seat, and, after pacing the room for a moment or two, the angry spot burning brighter on his cheek, stopped suddenly in front of Plantagenet, and said- "Are you mad?  What is the meaning of this change? Lexington and I left you onlylast evening, lying in that bed- the object of compassion to us both; and now we return, after laboring in your cause, and find you suddenly transformed from a frenzied lover into a heartless profligate." "No by heaven!" exclaimed Plantagenet, rising, and con- fronting Hamilton. "It is false; I am not a reprobate. But she, for Whom I had coined my heart-it is she who is the heartless profligate." "Are you in your senses," said I, "that you use such lan- guage touching a lady whose spotless purity of character de- mands the homage and respect of every gentleman?" "Perhaps, Lexington, you had better ascertain the truth of your facts, before you indulge the language of chivalry in be- half of a character that will only escape censure when it is consigned to obscurity." "Do I hear you?" cried Hamilton, actually doubting the   84         ROSE MLTON: evidence-of his senses. "Is it-can it be Plantagenet who is guilty of uttering such language of a lady who but yesterday was the idol of his heart? What has changed you thus? ho has been here instilling poisonous reports into your credulous ear, and abusing your confidence by casting suspicion on the character of Miss Walsingham?' "I am certainly very much obliged to you, Hamilton," re- plied Plantagenet, "for the interest you take in my affairs; but I beg to say that I am sufficiently able to manage my own business without the interference of any of my friends, some of whom seem very strongly inclined to thrust themselves for- ward, as if they occupied a very conspicuous place in my affec- tions." Hamilton raised his clenched hand as if about to strike, but, checking himself, he quietly resumed his seat and looked at me; but, although he said nothing, and his manner was per- fectly calm, yet there was a look of indignation in every fea- ture of his face, that told how much his heart was bleeding. I saw that Hamilton expected me to say something, although I was so niuch bewildered that I scarcely knew what to say. 'Pray listen to me for a moment, Plantagenet;" said I, "iand if you do not see your situation and ours in their true light, you must, indeed, be unworthy of the esteem which I have hitherto borne for your character. When Hamilton and myself left you yesterday evening, you were in such a state of mental anguish,- in consequence of the reproof you had just received from Miss Walsingham, that, to relieve your misery and obtain pardon for your too zealous attentions, Hamilton and myself agreed that it was necessary for one of us to see Miss Walsingham, and to intercede for your pardon, and per- haps cause your restoration to her favor. It was Hamilton's lot to see Miss Walsingham. He went, saw, and obtained her consent to pardon the impetuosity of your conduct, and even to grant you a more favorable reception than you had yet obtained. Having accomplished all that friendship, nay, more than you had dared to hope, he comes to make you glad with   A ROMANCE.           85 the tidings of success, and you receive him not with grace or gratitude, but with insolence, and with impertinence that de. serves chastisement." "Chastisement " exclaimed Plantagenet.  "You must recall that word!" "Never!" said I. "'Never, whilst I can stand or draw a sword." "I shall not violate the hospitality of my roof," replied Plantagenet, thoughtfully; "and yet," continued he, "chas- tisement is a bitter word! But what is all this? You accuse me of wanting grace and gratitude. How was I to know that Hamilton had taken the extraordinary step of seeking an inter- view with Miss Walsingham on my account? And does he, or do you, know what-has come to my knowledge since we last met? Are you aware that there is a stain on the character of Miss Walsingham, that it is the public talk, and that she is being discarded from- society in consequence of her familiarity with Mr. Middleton?' "The miscreant who told you this," cried Hamilton, "de- serves the gibbet for his villainy I Who is the man that says this-dare you mention his name?" "I do not mind your menacing tone," replied Plantagenet; "but I have the information from. a friend who has my entire confidence." "Is it possible, Plantagenet," observed Hamilton, his gene- rosity breaking through the angry discussion like sunshine through stormy clouds-"is it possible that you place confi- dence in the base slanders of a man whose-life is one series of machinations against the morals of the community A man who, to gratify the malignity of his heart, has uttered these miserable slanders against a lady whose gentleness, whose virtues elevate her beyond the pale of suspicion! Mr. Caven- dish dares not believe these reports himsulf, an4 yet he has had art to make you believe them-you, whom he had every reason, when he invented these slanders, to believe was the 8*   86         ROSE MILTON: affianced lover of Miss Walsbigham He believed this, as sure as you are in that seat, and but for that belief he would not have invented this libel; such is the baseness of his heart." "You may expatiate until doomsday," replied Plantagenet. "There is no love lost between Cavendish and yourself; he has pretty much the opinion of you that you have of him. But he has mentioned circumstances-some of which come within my own knowledge-that leave not the shadow of a doubt on my mind that Miss Walsingham is guilty of a fami- liarity with Bay Middleton which must cause her exclusion from the society she once adorned." - What circumstances are those?" asked Hamilton. ' Do you not know that, judging from the appearance oLthings merely, your judgment might impeach the virtue of an angel? It is in this, in givming a plausible appearance to things, joining circumstances with surmises, and arranging false facts, that the art of the liar, the slanderer, consists; and I will venture to say that, if you inform me of the circumstances which to you seem to be' confirmation strong as proof of Holy Writ,' I shall so explain them, and so truthfully, that you will your- self publicly proclaim this chosen friend of yours to be a liar and a villain, who deserves to be driven from society, and ex- cluded forever from holding intercourse with fair women and brave men." "But perhaps you would like to consult Mr. Middleton?" replied Plantagenet, coldly. "He might be of some assistance, I should think." "I will answer for Mr. Middleton," said I; "for any re- port which tends to stain his character is false. Does Mr. Cavendish state this report from his own knowledge, or from communications derived through Mr. Middleton?" ' "He gave, Mr. Middleton as his authority," replied Plan- tagenet.  "But where is Mr. Cavendish?" asked Hamilton. "He must surely have been here to-day; perhaps that voice was his   A ROMANCE.           87 we heard in this room, whilst we were cooling our feet at your door. If so, why not confront him with us 7' "He is not here," replied Plantagenet. "a e was here, it is true, and on business of a confidential nature, but retired by that door"-pointing to a side door---" when he perceived that Lexington and yourself were determined to force me to an in- terview, whether I would or no. I thank you, gentlemen, for the interest you have taken in my welfare, and now must re- spectfully bid you a very good evening." As neither Hamilton nor myself made the slightest move- ment, but firmly kept our seats, Plantagenet drew up his form to its utmost height, and looked at each of us alternately with an eye of fire. By and by, this feeling seemed to be giving place to one that was most natural to his character, for the muscles of his face began to be powerfully agitated, and his breast heaved with emotion, as if his heart was swelling with grief and pride. Suddenly, he dropped his face in his hands, and, turning to the wall, wept with convulsive agony. I rose from my seat and was about to approach him, but Hamilton, by a sign, motioned me to resume my seat, still keeping his eye fixed on Plantagenet, and from the quivering of his lips I knew that he too was suffering all the tortures of a wounded heart. CHAPTER X. AT this moment the servant of Plantagenet opened the door and beckoned to me. His manner was so mysterious that I immediately went to him, and received a note, which he said had just been placed in his hand by a person who was waiting below to receive my reply. To my astonishment, the letter was from Rose Milton, informing me of her arrival in Afton, and urging me to call upon her without delay, as she had some   88         ROSE MLTON: intelligence of the greatest importance to communicate to me. The scene I had just witnessed with Plantagenet, and that which I anticipated with Miss Milton, gave me such a violent fit of agitation that it was some minutes before I could speak to the messenger. Instead of sending a reply, I resolved to hasten at once to Miss Milton and ascertain the nature of her communication; but I suspected, and truly, that it related' to the disastrous reports touching the character of Miss Walsing ham, and that she was anxious to obtain my assistance in de- tecting the author of those reports. It was no great distance to Col. Milton's, who resided near the foot of King Street; and, as St. Michael's clock was striking nine, I entered his drawing-room. I shall not pause to describe this apartment, rich as it was in decorations, pictures and busts of statesmen, and of battle- fields; one of these, intended to comnnirmorate the actions of Colonel Washington, at the Cowpens, struck me as being par- ticularly good. I shall not pause, for the simple reason that the moment after entering the apartment I heard my name pronounced, and, in turning towards a distant part of the room, I saw the beautiful Rose Milton, who had just entered on, hear- ing of my arrival. She was in the bloom of youth, and of that extraordinary beauty which eclipsed even the fame of Julia Reid. In defiance of the fashionable folly, which piled up the hair on the crown of the head, Rose suffered her tres- ses to escape in the "hyacinthine flow," so much celebrated by her renowned ancestor, the poet Milton. But before trac- ing her family descent from its illustrious ancestors, I shall very briefly allude to her personal attributes and attractions. She was just about twenty years old, neither tall nor short, nor fat nor lean, with a fair skin, blue eyes, and auburn hair, flowing in tresses to her shoulders, that transcend the power of description, there was so much that was magical about them. If I add to this that she had a sweet, but firm, intrepid tem- per, and resolution that was inflexible, I shall have said enough.   A ROMANCE.            89 There was nothing in which she differed from her ser so much as in this, the inflexibility of her resolution, and in its steadi- ness, for constancy was the strongest ingredient of her charac- ter. Nor was this all; and what I had almost forgotten in this summary of her virtues, she was very wealthy; for besides the splendid mansion in Afton, her father owned several superb plantations, the most magnificent of which was called Abing- ton, in honor of the old poet. And this brings me to say something of her family, which was a collateral branch of the poet's, being lineal descendants of Sir Christopher Milton, the brother of the poet. The descendants of Sir Christopher Milton were Thomas, Mary, and Catherine; the isue of Tho- mas was the well-known Mrs. Milton, of Grosvenor Street, London, who emigrated to the East Indies, and finally to Afton, in the year 1740. It will be recollected that Fanny Walsingham had written to Rose on the subject of Mr. Plantagenet only the night pre- vious, dispatching her messenger post haste to Lewisfield. But at the same. moment Miss Milton had set out from Abing. ton for Afton, passed the messenger on the road, and then ar- rived in Afton without having received Fanny Walsingham's letter;. Her reason for returning so much sooner than she in- tended, for she had gone up to attend the private theatricals at Stratford-upon-Ashey, was because reports had reached her which were discreditable to the character of Miss Walsingham, who was her near relative, as well as most intimate friend. Rose had not yet seen Fanny. She had not even advertised Fanny of her arrival, for after reflecting on these scandalous reports; she had made up her mind-not doubting for an in- stant the virtue of her kinswoman-that the reports should be nipped at once, and that I was the most efficient person she could select for that purpose. It was, therefore, with this ob- ject that she sent me the note on her arrival, and it was to consult with me that she desired my presence at Col. Milton's. "Mr. Lexington," said Rose, "I have requested your comn   90         ROSE MLTON: pany, to eonsult you on a subject that gives me more pain than I ever experienced; in fact, I am so shocked that sometimes I almost doubt the reality of my being awake. Have you heard no rumors recently, that have surprised you? Be candid with me, for you know that, between ourselves there is a current of kindness that reflects our hearts. Be candid, then, and tell me if you heard no reports?" "I have, indeed," said I, "and, to be as candid as yourself, the reports implicate Miss Walsingham." "Yes," cried Rose, her face burning like fire, and her eyes flashing indignation, "Yes! implicate Miss Walsingham It is always the case; this is the way of the world to us women. No one thinks of censuring the man-it is the woman." "It is because men are not worth censuring," said I, " that they are never mentioned in these affairs. We are all rogues by nature." "You wish to reprove me," replied Rose, "but these charges are too cruel for me to submit without indignantly re- pelling them. .That Miss Walsingham is ipnocent, I have not the shadow of a doubt. I have not even seen her since my arri- val, so confident am I that it is all a scheme, concocted by some villain, who has been discarded by my friend; but who can it be? Have you an idea? I have puzzled myself, and all in vain, to discover the infamous wretch who has circulated this odious scandal." "I have discovered, and by the merest accident, who is actually the author of this report;" and here I related the conversation I had held with Isabella Huntly, at Mrs. Hamil- ton's, and the information she had imparted to me of Caven- dish being the originator of the report. At all events, it was from him that she had derived her knowledge on the subject. "Isabella Huntly!" said Rose, thoughtfully, and, as if re- calling some transactions in which that young lady had been implicated. She rose from her chair, went to a table, and ap- peared to examine some papers; then returned to her chair, o   A ROMANCE.           91 seated herself, and after some moments, without having uttered  a word, rose a second time, and again examined the papers on the table, What those papers were, or in what way they were connected with Miss Huntly, she did not explain. "'I do not believe her P' exclaimed Miss Milton, with the usual decision of her character, for she had been engaged in calculating the chances for or against Miss Huntly being the author of the report herself, and had come to the conclusion that she was; and I could perceive from her manner, with which I was perfectly familiar, that no longer doubting the culpability of Miss Huntly, she was devising the ways and means of approaching her on the subject. This absorbed her so much that I thought it necessary to recall her to what I believed to be the truth.  "You do not appear to believe the words of Miss Huntly," said I, " but if you knew Mr, Cavendish as well as I do, you would believe any report derogatory to his character." " He may be the meanest man in existence," replied Miss Milton, "but, in a case like this, I defy him to be more des- picable than Isabella Huntly. This. is not the first time that she has been engaged in seeking to destroy the peace of fami- lies, or of blasting the reputation of young ladies, whose vir- tue she envies with the malignity of a demon. I know her too well, Mr. Lexington, to believe that she is circulating this scandal at the suggestion of Mr. Cavendish." "Even supposing all your conjectures to be true," said I, "there is yet one circumstance which is to me inexplicable. When this report was told me by Miss Huntly, I was at Mrs. Hamilton's, and left immediately with my friend, Archibald Hamilton, for Mr. Plantagenet's. There we found him, locked up with some one whose voice, I am convinced, was that of Mr. Cavendish. When admitted,-we could discover nothing of the person who had been closeted with Plantagenet, and who must have made his escape by a secret door. But the look, the tone, the temper, and the conversation of Mr. Plantagenet,   92         ROSE MLTON: left me no room to doubt that Mr. Cavendish had been with him, and had poured this poisonous report in his ear, for he who was so desperately in love with Miss Walsingham, and in whose behalf Hamilton had only the last evening obtained that lady's avowal of a- mutual passion--even he, who had been thus enamored, was now so violent in his denunciation of her character and conduct, that it wasdifficult for Hamilton or myself to resist the desire we felt for chastising him in his own house." "This is all a mystery to me," said Rose, very much aston- ished. "I have not been long absent from the city, and yet all this has occurred already! You speak of Miss Walsing- ham's being favorable to the suit of Mr. Plantagenet? I was not aware that he ever had been paying his addresses in that quarter; but even stranger than this, you tell me that Mr. Hamilton, in a recent interview with Miss Walsingham, ob- tained from that young lady the avowal of her attachment for Mr. Plantagenet. All these things would appearto be incredi- ble, Mr. Lexington, did they not come from you. It appears from what you have just now said, that I must not proceed so fast as I had at first intended; at all. events, before taking any steps touching the conduct of Isabella Huntly, I must see Miss Walsingham on the subject of Mr. Plantagenet and her- self. - I would answer for Fanny as for nmyself, but I cannot reconcile it to the prudent caution of her character, that she should have revealed the. secret sentiments of her heart to Mr. Hamilton. Call again to-morrow evening." "St. Michael's clock shall not be more punctual to the hour than I shall be to you," said I; and, kissing her hand, I retired from the apartment.   A ROMANCE.           93 CHAPTER XI. As I placed my foot on the banquette, in front of C61. Mil- ton's, the servant of Miss Walsingham passed me, and entered the house. I knew from his haste and appearance that he had been on a journey in the country, and very naturally surmised that he bore the letter which Miss Walsingham had written to Rose Milton. Such proved to be the fact, and as it was in this letter that Fanny recounted her recent interview with Hamilton, it was sent long before Rose had determined her plan of action. In the first place, she rgsolved to go to Fanny, and then shape her course according to the nature of the events that should occur. It was eleven o'clock when her carriage stopped at the door of Mr. Walsingham's house, in Meeting Street. There was a light in the parlor, and a sound of music, as if Fanny was playing on the piano. In another moment the two friends were locked in each other's embrace, and they mutually shed tears as they still continued to hold each other by the hand, and asked for the fiftieth time how each had been since long, long ago. "Oh, Rose, how glad I am that you have come!" cried the affectionate Fanny. I have felt your absence as if a part of myself had been suddenly cut away, and left me mourning for that which was lost. I have been dissipating, too, a good deal at balls and parties-sitting up late, and dancing late and early." "I hope, my dear Fanny," replied Rose, " that you have not been too imprudent?" "What do you mean?" asked Fanny, the color flying from her cheek at the strange tone of her friend. "Have you re- 9   "        ROSE MLTON: ceived my letter? I wrote you a long, long letter, last night, explaining-" "Yes," replied Rose, "I have just got it; your servant brought it to me not a half an hour since, and it is that partly which has brought me here so late in the evening., But, touching the incident you mention about Mr. Plantagenet, we must be silent for a moment, and pass on to something of more importance to your character."' "'My character?" inquired Fanny, a tear trembling in her eye, for she saw- from the manner. of Miss. Milton that there was some dilemta into which she had unwittingly fallen. "I 4o not understand you, Rose," she continued, yet scarcely able to articulate a. word distinctly; "speak plainly, and let me know what you mean." I mean not to wound your feelings unnecessarily," replied Rose " but I must tell you of certain reports which are cur- rent not only in the city, but in the country, for I heard them even at Abington, and have hastened to town for the purpose of seeing you concerning them." "For the love of God," exclaimed Fanny Walsingham,. "explain your meaning I What reports? What is current? Who have been talking about me? Oh, speak, my sweet Rose, and tell me all you know on the subject." "Were you ever at; Dunbrittan?" asked Rose, still holding and pressing the hand of Fanny, as if to reassure her-sinking. heart. "Never," replied Fanny. I do know the Montagues, but I have never been at their place. Why do you inquire?" ' You must answer my questions for the present, without requiring any explanations," replied Miss Milton. "Now try and remember when you were last at Walton Basset." "I was there just a week ago to-day," replied Fanny, en- deavoring to recall every circumstance that had occurred at Walton Basset; but she appeared to be groping her way in vain, when Rose said-   A ROMANCE.           95 "A report is in circulation, my dear Fanny, which is de- signed to stain your virtue. I must speak plainly," she said for Fanny, unable to bear the imputation on her character, had buried her head in her friend's bosom, and sobbed as if her heart would break. "I must speak plainly, Fanny, for I am certain that you are innocent, and that you should know the full extent of the ruinous report. It is said that, when at Walton Basset, you permitted Mr. Middleton to be altogether too familiar in his attentions to you, and that your conduct was so scandalous that most of the ladies were compelled to leave the party and return to town." Spare me! spare me!" exclaimed Miss Walsingham. "There is not a word of truth. in the whole statement! It is true that I was at Walton Basset, but I never once saw Mr. Middleton there. It is a most infamous falsehood! infamous! infamous!" ' I never doubted you for a moment," replied Rose; ' but it was necessary that I should obtain some explanation from you before proceeding to take other steps." To take other steps!" cried Fanny. "In the name of all that is sacred, what have I done that my name should be bruited about in a scandal like this? Who has originated this report?" "That is just what I shall try to discover; and I think that I have now obtained a clue to the mystery. Can you remem- ber if Isabella Huntly was present on the occasion?" "Yes, she was," replied Fanny. "She came there escorted by Mr. William Cavendish; and I now remember, from cer- tain things which transpired, that she displayed a good deal of jealousy in consequence of the attentions I received. As to Mr. Cavendish, I have such abhorrence of his character that it is but seldom he ever has the impudence to approach me. Can it be possible that Isabella Huntly has been trying to destroy me by circulating a report that I displayed scandalous fami- liarity with a gentleman on that occasion?"   96         ROSE MLTON: aC You may rest assured of this," replied Miss Milton, " that either Isabella Huntly or Mr. Cavendish is the author of the report, as I have heard of their giving it currency in many quarters recently, That you did not hear of it is not singular, because the object of a calumny is generally the most ignorant of its circulation; and, indeed, it has been so recently put in motion that it was only this morning it reached my ears, and not until this afternoon were some of your frieods informed of its existence, and by Isabella Huntly herself." Fanny tried in vain to ask what friends these were, but her heart was too full with grief, and she sunk into the arms of her friend as helpless as an infant. And surely such was the contrast between those two noble creatures,so alike in virtuous rectitude, and so unlike in their characters. The one all mild- ness, simplicity, and prudence, the other all spirit, firmness, and constancy; and both together making one noble woman- a woman womanly. It must not be supposed, however, that Rose lacked mildness, simplicity, and prudence, or that Fanny was deficient in spirit, firmness, or constancy. The chief cha- racteristic of Rose was bravery of spirit, and the distinguishing trait of Fanny was mildness. In the one, the elements were so mixed that she might have lived in Eden without detracting from its simplicity; in the other, there was a fire, a spirit, an energy of character that was irrepressible and inextinguishable; she regarded a friend as a part of herself, making their inte- rests and inclinations identical with her own, and exerting all her power to render them happy and contented. Such a cha- racter is not very often found among women, but, when found, they eclipse all others, man or woman. "Why, why am I persecuted thus?" said Fanny. "Why am I singled out for the subject of this base scandal? I have never injured one human being in all my life, and even now, but for my confidence in your friendship, my sweet Rose, I would not, I could not believe the existence of such a report as that you have mentioned. Scandalous familiarity with' Mr.   A ROMANCE.           97 Middleton! 'Tis false!" Her voice faltered, and she again gave vent to a flood of tears. "I have not even seen that gen- tleman for a long time," she continued, "and my acquaintance with him is so slight that we have not exchanged twenty words in our lives. There is something. below the surface, some un- der-current, that is designed to destroy me. But I do not believe that Isabella Huntly is the author of this report. I have known her from infancy, and although there is much to reprove in her conduct, yet I am convinced that she is not to blame, at least so much as you have insinuated. It is true that some things have passed between us, but they were only 6f a temporary importance, and we have long since renewed our intimacy with even firmer bonds; and it is only two days since she called here, spent the entire morning with me, and' 'ecalling the merry times we used to have at Grace Dieu." "If anything could confirm my suspicions," said Rose, " it would be this last circumstance you mention. Why all this sudden flood of friendship? It was to blind your eyes at the' very moment she was spreading her net to ensnare you. Those persons who make presents have always a sinister design to accomplish, and presents are their bribes; it is the same with those who make themselves unusually agreeable. Beyond a certain circle there is little real friendship, and self-interest is the only motive. In suddenly remembering the merry times' she had at your father's, she was aware that, by touching that cord, she would readily gain access to your heart, and thus win your love whilst she was blasting your name. But you may say, What motive could she possibly have hadin circulating' Such a story?"This questions may be asked in every case of mystery; for what we do not see we think doubtful, and what we do not comprehend we think impossible. Now rely for a Certainty on' this, that Isabella Huntly is at this time indus- triously employed in striving to destroy you, and in that cha- racter is just as criminal as if she was the original author of the calumny. We shall know tormorrow."  9*   98         ROSE MLTON: This remark closed the conversation on that subject; and, as Rose knew the extreme -misery to which Fanny had been re- duced by this scandal, she determined to remain, and, dismiss- ing her carriage, retired with her friend to solicit "tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep." CHAPTER- XII. BUT sleep came not to her eyes that night; and, with the first streak of light, Rose was up and writing an invitation, re- questing Mr. Middleton to call at her father's that morning. Just as she was about to dispatch this note, however, the idea occurred to her that a letter from Mr. Middleton would be of more real service than any conversation, even the most explicit and satisfactory. She threw the note of invitation into the fire, and determined to write to him on the subject, the follow- ing being the result of her resolution:- "AFTON, December, 18-. I know that you will express great astonishment, dear sir,. when you receive this letter, wondering what could induce me to trespass on your good nature at an hour when so many of my sex are dreaming away their morning hours like the Sy- barites of old. But I have that in my heart which torments me like a fiend, and, unless I pluck it out, there will be no rest, no quiet, no happiness for me. If the friendship which has so long existed between us-and our fathers, too, are friends-may not pardon this intrusion, yet my knowledge of your really kind heart and gentlemanly character assure me that, speaking in behalf of offended innocence, you will treat my overture with courtesy and kindness. "Has any circumstance occurred within the last month   A ROMANCE.            99 J   which impressed itself particularly on your mind? Think over the various little incidents that interest and amuse one, and, among some of these, can your memory recall the scenes at Walton Basset, when you spent the day with Mr. Thomas Berkeley? My reason for making this very singular request is that a scandal has been founded on. the occurrences of that day, which cruelly lacerates the heart of, Miss Walsingham, and which, if unexplained or uncontradicted, will drive her from society and from the world, of which she is the brightest orna- ment. You will readily perceive, without my suggesting it, that this scandal, though designed to destroy Miss Walsing- ham, connects a name with hers, which, from motives of re- spect and esteem, I shall leave a blank; but that you will fill it with the proper name I do not doubt, from my knowledge of your discretion and discernment. I, therefore, entreat you to relate the occurrences of that day at Walton Basset, that I may be able to crush this calumny, and restore to Miss Wal- singham the peace of mind and heart which this cruel report has destroyed. "I am, very respectfully,   - "ROSE MLTON." Having dispatched this letter by a servant, ordering him to wait a reply, Rose directed her thoughts to the steps she should take in the event Mr. Middleton returned a favorable or un- favorable answer. She sat brooding over this question for a long time, but, turn and turn it as she would, there occurred but one final answer to all the questions she asked of herself, and that answer was, that she must see Isabella Huntly. It is singular how much more suspicious the fair sex are of each other than they are of the lords of creation. Whether it rises from the fact that they know each other better or not, true it is that, if there be any scandal, or any calumny, touching the fair name of a woman, they always attribute'the authorship to one of their own sex; and it is equally certain that they are   -100         ROSE MLTON: still less forgiving to an erring sister-a stain on one being viewed as a stain on all. But, passing this, it was evident that Rose knew something concerning the character of Isabella Huntly which had nob been revealed to the public gaze; and, from certain remarks to Miss Walsiugham that I have recorded, it is certain she had-long suspected Miss Huntly of intriguing for the destruction of her friend. What the motive could be was not so definite, but that the fact was true she was as cer- tain as of any fact whatever. In this state of her conjectures, she resolved to seek an in- terview with Miss Huntly, and had already taken up her hat and shawl, when Fanny's maid announced a gentleman, who requested "a moment's conversation with Miss Milton." She hastened down to the parlor, expecting to find Mr. Lexington, but, to her astonishment, she encountered Mr. MiddletonA* "I did not expect you to answer my letter in person," she said, smiling, and giving him her hand; "but I have not words to express my happiness at -your coming, if"----- "If my reply be favorable," said Mr. Middleton, bowing with his usual griace. "Can it be otherwise?" asked Rose, with a little trepidation in her speech and manner. "The moment I read your letter," resumed Mr. Middleton, "I recognized the necessity of seeing you at once; for doubt- less you intended that I should fill up the blank with my name. Now, to prove how scandalous this report is, you will be surprised to learn that I was not at Walton Basset at all; and I think that Miss Walsingham will satisfy you that she did not see me there on the occasion to which you refer." I had no doubt on the subject, for Miss Walsingham had- already told me that she had not seen you at Walton: Basset," replied Rose; "but I wished a reply, in writing, {o satisfy * He was a descendant of Arthur Middleton, who headed the revo- lution of 1719, by which the government of the proprietors was over- thrown, and the province placed under the immediate control of the' crown.   A ROMANCE.          101 others who may be induced, with the common charity of the world, to credit this scandal. But now that you are here, will you pardon me for suggesting the expediency of your aiding me in my task? I must endeavor to see Miss Huntly, and, your presence at the interview would be all important." "It will afford me much pleasure to accompany you," said Mr. Middleton, "though I fear that Miss Huntly will regard me as an intruder in this business; but she has used my name in connection with Miss Walsingham's; and it is only right that I should justify myself at the same time that you acquit your friend of the charges against her character." "Come, then," replied Rose, and taking the arm of Mr. Middleton, they proceeded on foot to the residence of Miss Huntly.. They sent up their-names, and after a slight delay were admitted to the presence of the lady, who was evidently disconcerted by the visit, but with the self-possession that was the essence of impudence, she welcomed Rose very affection- ately, and gave her hand to Mr. Middleton as if he was " one in a thousand." "I really must quarrel with you," she remarked to Rose, "for treating me as if I was quite a stranger; where have you been this month past? And you, Mr. Middleton, seem to have forgotten the time when we used to read the 'Faerie Queene,' and talk of the gentle knight 'Ycladde in mightie armes and silver shielde.'" Here she paused, for though these words were addressed to Mr. Middleton, she was looking at Rose, whose face indicated a certain something in her thoughts that was exquisitely pain- ful. They now regarded each other for some moments, with- out speaking. Mr. Middleton having seated himself with the air of a man who was accustomed to receive certain salutations without replying; at length, suppressing her emotions, Rose made out to say:- "I have called to have a little talk with you." "You are quite right," replied Miss Huntly; "if one can-   * 102         ROSE MLTON: not have a little talk with one's friend, one may as well take to a country life at once." "But," said Rose, struggling to suppress the tear that was springing to her eye, in spite of her resolution," but I have called to have a little talk with you on a subject that affects nme very, very much." Here she paused again, and Miss Huntly, who well knew the resolute character of Rose, re- mained silent, as if expecting some extraordinary intelligence. You could n6t have perceived, from a single trace in her face, that she was perfectly aware of the object Which had prompted the visit of Miss Milton. "You must have heard,"' continued Rose, " for it is said to be current everywhere; that a report, a scandalous report, is in circulation, oriminating the character of Miss Walsingham."  Rose paused again, overpowered by A the emotions that agitated her feelings, nor did the air and manner of Miss Huntly teid, in the slightest degree, to re- store her usual command over herself. If you have," said Rose, when happening to catch the eye of Mr. Middleton, she paused again; for to speak on such a subject in the presence of a gentleman, now struck her so forcibly as transcending the bounds of modesty, that her heart died away, and she buried her face in her hands, and burst into tears. Mr. Middleton rose from his seat deeply affected, and after regarding Rose for some time with tender emotion, he turned to Miss Huntly, and said .*- "You will pardon me for. this intrusion, Miss Huntly, when you learn that the-report to which Miss Milton refers has a very important bearing on myself, and as it is necessary that I should contradict it, you must see the propriety of my presence here." "I will not say that I do not understand you," replied Miss Huntly, "but in assuming that I am the author of this report, have you satisfied yourself that I am really the person to whom your suspicion is applicable?" It was at my suggestion that Mr. Middleton came here," o  .      .   A ROMANCE.           103 said Rose, for he did not know of this report until I informed him of it, and it was by my request that he accompanied me on this visit." I I am truly under very many obligations to you," replied Miss Huntly, with the slightest sarcasm in her tone, "for it appears that you have traced this scandal to me, and now seek to obtain my confession in the presence of a witness" "It is not necessary that I should relate the circumstances which are reputed to have occurred at Walton Basset," said Rose, "for I am perfectly convinced of my inability to add to your knowledge. on the subject; but. this I will state, that your name, has been the only one mentioned in connection with the origin of this scandal, and I have full power to use the, name of Mr. Lexington as my authority." "Indeed!" exclaimed Miss Huntly, ." Mr. Lexington has- been quick in his report to you; but did he not state that I gave my authority for the rumor'" "He told me," replied Rose, "that you had given the name of Mr. Cavendish a. your authority; that he had heard of; it from no one but yourself; but the inference, or the imputation. of its: authorship," continued Rose, as a bright spot settled on her cheek, "was my own suspicion, and, acting on that sus. pieion, I -have, come 'with Mr. Middleton, who, in your pre- sence, will deny that the charge of familiarity at Walton Bas- set,. between Miss Walsingham and himself, is true, for he was not: present at the fete of Mr. Berkeley." "Why do you tell this to me?" inquired Miss Huntly, as if angry at the reflections- in the remarks-of Rose; "am I to  be saddled; with the authorship of all the scandal tha;t circu- lates in: Afton? The report in question is common rumor. I have known it for some days, but it was only last evening that I mentioned it. to Mr. Lexington, and when doing so, I gave him my authority. It is to that authority the friends of Miss. Walsingham should apply, if they seek to suffocate the scan- dalous charge against her character."   104        ROSE MLTON: "In any event," replied Rose, now thoroughly self-possessed, as she felt herself on secure ground, "you are-now convinced that the report is utterly and entirely false, and I hope that you will endeavor to neutralize your agency in this scandal, by taking occasion to contradict it as cheerfully as you have circu- lated it." The withering sarcasm of these remarks actually perplexed Miss Huntly, but it was for a moment only, her native impu- dence continuing to support her through thick and thin. "I have, it is true," she replied, "spoken freely of the con- duct of Miss Walsingham; "but it occurs to me that those who are most interested in her vindication should be her chief advocates." Here she paused, and looked at Mr. Middleton, who bowed, as fully appreciating the force of her insinuation. "If Miss Walsingham," she continued, "desires any expla- nation of me, I shall very readily accede to her request, re- serving to myself, of course, the privilege of believing the truth or falsity of this new version of the old report." Mr. Middleton partly rose from his seat, but soon resumed it, taking- refuge from the attack on his veracity in the silence which most becomes a gentleman, but Miss Milton met her antagonist bravely. "Your belief is of no importance in a case like this," re- plied Rose; "but as you aided in circulating a scandal, which may destroy a sweet girl, it is surely necessary that you avow your agency to have been founded on a delusion, and that Miss Walsingham is not guilty of this infamous, and inju- rious report. Your own sense of justice, however much your mind may have been perverted, stould teach you to do this, for there is somewhere a heart that still beats for truth, even in the most callous breast. If, then, you would rectify the evil that you have committed; if you would restore a heart to the happiness that you have crushed; I implore you to advocate the cause of virtue, and assert the truth of this affair. Why do you refuse this? What injury have you received at the hands   A ROMANCE.           105 of Miss Walsingham, that you prefer falsehood to truth, slan- der to honesty?" Rose paused for a reply, but no reply came, for Miss Huntly, having fixed her eyes intently on a picture of Marion at Eutaw, was apparently engaged in the conduct of a bloody battle, instead of listening to the expostulation of the fair ad- vocate; and in this position she remained, without moving hand or foot,'or even winking her eye, for two hours after Miss Milton and Mr. Middleton had retired from her presence. CHAPTER XIII. WHEN. Rose reached her father's house, she bid Mr. Middle- ton adieu, and, hastening to her chamber,- gave vent to her feelings in a burst of tears. She had been foiled in all her ef- forts ,to remove the stain from the character of her friend, through the instrumentality of Miss Huntly. It is true that Mr. Mi;dleton had relieved her anxiety by his testimony in favor of Miss Walsingham, but her great anxiety was to cause the suppression of the scandalous libel through the assistance of Miss Huntly, who. had been so busily engaged in dissemi- nating its falsehood. And now that there were no longer any hopes in that quarter, Rose asked herself fifty times in the course of the day what plan she should adopt? Evidently Mr. Cavendish was the ostensible and reliable authority for the scandal, but when was she to approach him? and how? And should she approach him herself, or by proxy? But who would be her proxy? In whom could she confide an affair of this con- sequence? But the importance of acting promptly-for time rolls his ceaseless course, and promptness was of the greatest importance in a case like the present-made her look to the approaching interview with Mr. Lexington with anxious solici- 10   106        ROSE MLTON: tude. And when St, Michael's bell struck nine, she listened for the step of Mr. Lexington. "Thank God!" she exclaimed, as she heard the bell ring, and hastened down to the drawing-room, where in a little while she had the pleasure of meeting the gentleman who, at the moment, engrossed her whole heart and soul. "I was so certain it was you," said Rose, "that I am con- fident I heard the bell pronounce your name."  "Did you doubt that I would be here at the-hour?" asked Lexington; for the reader must now and then permit me to speak in the third person.  "To speak truly, I was more fearful of the consequence of your not coming," replied Rose, "than-" "Fearful " exclaimed Lexington;."what has happened since last night to create this change in your tonel You scarcely look like the same being!" "Listen, then," replied Rose, "and learn what I have been doing;" and here she gave a brief and hurried sketch of her letter to Mr. Middleton, of their visit to Miss Huntly, the conversation with her, and its result, and concluded by asking the opinion of Lexington as to her further proceedings, for proceed she would, in spite of all obstacles, and in defiance of  all difficulties, until this whole affair was honorably adjusted. "There is no other resource except Mr. Cavendish,' replied Lexington, "and it is necessary that he be made to contradict this story, as publicly as he is represented to have circulated it. But if there has been really any collusion between Mr. Cavendish and Miss Huntly, it would be absolutely requisite that some one hold an interview with him, before Miss Huntly can notify him of your zealous interest in this business." "Is Mr. Cavendish in Afton?" asked Miss Milton. "It is impossible to say where he is at present/' replied Lex- ington, "for all his movements are so mysterious that one sel- dom knows where to find him. I am positive, however, he was at Mr. Plantagenet's last evening, for I not only heard   A ROMANCE.           107 his voice, but the temper of Mr. Plantagenet, and the tone of his conversation, leave no doubt on my mind that Mr. Caven- dish had been closeted with him, when Mr. Hamilton and my- self arrived at his house." "You speak of the tone of Mr. Plantagenet-do I under- stand you as hinting that the remarks of Mr. Plantagenet were applicable to Miss Walsingham?" Lexington bowed, without daring to trust himself in reply, for the language used by Plantagenet, in reference to Miss Walsingham, was of a nature to excite the deep resentment of her friend."               e "Why, this affair is more complicated than I had imagined,'i said Rose; " and it is necessary that prompt measures be taken at once. You will, I am sure, Mr. Lexington, as my friend and as the friend of Miss Walsingham, use your best endea- vors to stop this black ball; it must roll no longer; will you not assist me?" "I am here this evening for that purpose," replied Lexing- ton;- -and now that Miss Huntly has refused her aid in arresting this current, we must direct our attention to Mr. Cavendish. He cannot refuse to recant, or contradict his previous statement after the declaration of Mr. Middleton; if he does, the consequences will be on his own head." Rose Milton sprung from her chair, walked to and fro the room, her eyes beaming, her cheek burning with exultation, and her- whole person animated into eloquence. Her very nature seemed to be expanding, as if a sun, new risen on the old, was showering down its golden beams, and war ug her with the life of a purer world than this dull globe of o "Having concluded on the course most proper to be pur- sued," added Lexington, "it is necessary that I enter at once upon prosecuting this enterprise. I am convinced that Mr. Cavendish is this very moment thinking of us. Adieu, then, for the present; and should anything prevent my seeing you   108         ROSE MLTON: immediately, I shall try and send you a line by some confi- dential friend." "Success!" exclaimed Rose, as she took the hand of Lex- ington in both of hers. "Success!" repeated Lexington, and the next moment he was in the street, and pursuing his way by the light, of the lamps, as if they too were witnesses of the pledge he had just made to- the beautiful Rose Milton; his step was so proud, his eye so bright, and his heart so full! , But we must return to Rose. In the joy-of her heart she determined*to hasten at once to Miss Walsingham, and com- #iunicate to her friend the result of her late adventure with Miss Huntly, and her subsequent interview with Mr. Lexing- ton. The chief obstacle to her visit was the lateness of the hour, for it was fast drawing on towards ten o'clock, and the carriage had not returned; her father having gone to dine with a friend, who, in the spirit of the old rtgime, protracted their sittings until the middle of night. How shall I contrive to get to Fanny 7" said Rose, listen- ing in hopes of hearing the returning wheels of the carriage; but no sound except the occasional cry of the watchman broke on the stillness of the night. She rung for her maid, Venus, but gave no orders after the girl had appeared, sitting at her little table, intently gazing at a copy of Moore's Epicurean as if she expected to be relieved of her difficulties by some modern Hierophant. At length, however, she seemed to have concluded on a plan of operations; it did not generally take Rose many minutes to plan a campaign--and making a sign to Venus, that blackness visible vanished, and almost imme- diately after appeared, with a hat and cloak. Rose put on the hat carefully, and then tied its strings as carefully; she then put on the cloak, which was so snug and nice, and having fastened the collar, took a look at her appearance in one of the large mirrors that adorned the room. "Smart enough," she said, and so Venus said too; and after once more reassuring   A ROMANCE .          109 herself on the propriety of her going out so late at night, she told Venus to inform her father that she had gone to Mr. Walsinghai's, and to have the carriage sent for her very early the next morning, as she would return home to breakfast. The reader expects that all this is merely a prelude to our heroine's being very much frightened, and chased up this street, and down that alley, by dissipated Arabs, who insult #r assault at pleasures every defenceless young woman whom they chance to encounter on the banquette, after a certain hour of the night. But I have no such adventures to relate, for Rose was insulted by no one, was pursued by no one, or as- saulted by no one; but walked to Mr. Walsingham's unmo- lested by anything, except those terrible thoughts about rob- bers and rogues that will infest the brain of womankind. It is true, indeed, that when she passed a watchman, he would step from his post-the lamp-post-and scrutinize her features, much to her consternation; but she would have reached her destination without much perturbation of spirit, had it' not been for those terrible horseguards, that came dashing round a corner, jingling their spurs, and sabres, and sabre-chains, as if there was a bloody field to be fought and won, before the world should wake with fear and trembling. It was with considerable astonishment that Rose discovered Fanny still up, and reading in her chamber. "How can I sleep!" said she, in reply to the exclamation of surprise uttered by Rose, "with such a terrible accusation hanging over me? Should thb scandal come to the knowledge of my father, there would be blood shed before the sun rise to-morrow morning." "But I have taken care to prevent its reaching him if possible," replied Rose, "for I well know what would be-the consequence of such a catastrophe. It was lucky that I returned to Afton when I did, for now we may succeed in putting a period to its duration." And here Rose recounted to Fanny the contents of her letter to Mr. Middleton, his 10*   "O        ROSE MLTON: coming to her in consequence, and of their interview with Isabella Huntly. She now. spoke of Mr. Cavendish, of the strange manner in which he was mixed up with this affair, and of the object he must have in view, should he and not Miss Huntly, be really the original slanderer. "I have been thinking ever since my interview with Miss Huntly," observed Rose, "whether Mr. Cavendish is at the bottom of all this business, and if so, what inducement 1h could have in view, in thus attempting to stain your reputation. Has he ever been particularly attentive in his conduct towards you? 'Tell me all, Fanny, for there must be some cause for his conduct; no human being is so entirely depraved as to act without some motive. Has Mr. Cavendish ever addressed you?" "I never gave him the opportunity," replied Fanny; "but he has been, until recently, not only very marked in his atten- tions, but seemed on all occasions to assume the privilege of appropriating me exclusively to himself. I had no peace, no rest for him, until I was compelled to bring his attentions to a conclusion, by denying myself to him, when he called, and of treating him with indifference, when we met. It is this that prompts his present conduct, if he be indeed the author of this scandal; but I cannot believe it possible, for-I have simply acted on the defensive, without uttering a word that -might wound, or doing an act that could be construed into disrespect; for whatever may be my private opinion of Mr. Cavendish, I trust that I have too much selfteespect. to trample on the feel- ings of any person." Rose took her friend in her arms, and kissed her fifty times. "And now," said she, "I must tell you that, notwithstanding the failure of my overture to Miss Huntly, I have engaged our friend, Mr. Lexington, to see Mr. Cavendish on the subject." Here she. ran hastily over the particulars of our interview. "It is true," continued Rose, "that you are not acquainted with Mr. Lexington, but he is the friend of Mr. Plantagenet;   A ROMANCE.           11l and as such, apart from all other reasons, he will be sure to make your cause his own, and to render such an account of Mr. Cavendish, as will neutralize his action in this scandalous report. You may depend therefore upon his diplomacy, and sleep once more in peace." "Thank heaven!" cried the afflicted girl, kissing the cheek of her friend. "O, how shall I be able to repay you for all your kindness?"    , "We will speak of that hereafter," replied Rose; "but now, let us slumber with Juno on the golden bed," and in one hour the two girls were fast asleep. CHAPTER XIV. W*WE shall now trace the actions of Mr. Lexington, for I must continue to speak of that gentleman in the third person. The words of Miss Milton were still ringing in his ears, when he reached his hotel; and after reflecting a moment, as to the line of conduct which it was necessary for him to adopt in the present emergency, and the probability of his finding Mr. Cavendish at home, he concluded to go there, late as it was in the night, instead of delaying until morning, believing, with Lord Bacon, that "when things are once come to the execu- tion, there is no secrecy comparable to celerity-like thedno- tion of the bullet in the air, which flieth so swift as it outruns the eye." He therefore prepared to set jorth immediately, having ordered his carriage to be in readiness; and with a aommendable .prudence, placing a pair of trusty pistols in his pocket; for in dealing with a man like Cavendish, it was ne- cessary for one to' be always on one's guard. Being thus armed, he sprung into his carriage, ordering the servant to drive directly to Mr. Cavendish's; and wrapping himself   "2         ROSE MLTON: warmly in his cloak, looked through the glass windows at the lamps, posts, and passengers, as if every lamp, post, and pas- senger, were so many figures in a diorama,'hastening on to Colonel Milton's, whilst he was riding away under the influ- ence of some mysterious spell to Mr. Cavendish's. What spell was that? Was it love? What interest could, he possibly feel in the hopes, the fears, the fortunes of a young lady, who was almost a stranger to him? It is true that she had been most cruelly slandered, but was that any good reason why he should. become her champion? Or was he now playing the chivalrous knight-errant in obedience to the wishes of one who had stirred up the embers of his heart, and kindled a fire, which was burning fiercely in his breast? Nemesis must de- termine, and, in the meantime, the carriage stopped, Lexington descended the step, and knocked for admittance at the door of Mr. Cavendish's residence. The summons was promptly an- swered, and in reply to Lexington's inquiry, the servant stated that his master had been at home almost the entire evening, but had only just left with Mr. Pinkey for Pinkey House. If such was the truth, then Mr. Cavendish would not sleep at home; and accordingly Lexington had no other resource than to return, intending to visit Pinkey House early the next day. But, on returning to his hotel by way of King Street, he recognized a party of his friends, George Granville, Henry Derby, Philip York, and one or two more, who had been attempting to -be merry at Muggridge's; and who had been so sucOessful in their-attempts at making merry, that they were one and all quite belligerent; for they hurrahed, and shouted, and seemed disposed to attack, and sack the city, without stop- ping to ascertain, "what reinforcement they might gain from -hope, or what resolution from despair.'i But Captain Dore, a fierce soldier at all times, but particularly so in the dark,. for he was the captain of the City Guard, happening to hear the tocsin of war sounded under his very nose, sprung his rattles, marched to the blazing field, charged among the young pala-   A ROMANCE.           113 dins, as if they were the veritable Franks of Roncesvalles, van- quished them, made them prisoners, one and all; and of course captured Lexington too, because, like the good little dog Tray, he was found in bad company. It would be improper for me' to disclose the secrets of the guard-house; I shall merely state, therefore, that, as the cap- tain was well acquainted with his prisoners, he refused to release them until the next morning, enjoying himself greatly with their society, more than once standing treat," and treat- ing his prisoners standing, with all the honors of war, and occasionally roaring himself as gently as a sucking dove, like Nick Bottom, in "Midsummer Night's Dream." In consequence of this delay, Lexington did not arrive at Pinkey House until twelve o'clock the next day; for it was necessary that one should take some rest after the fatigue and excitement of the evening. Having dressed himself, therefore, and " lodged" a " little tea and toast," he walked into Church Streetand stopped atPinkey House, inquiring for Mr. Cavendish, though faintly expecting a favorable reply, as that gentleman was known to be very mercurial in his motions. In reply to his summons, Lexington was requested to walk in, which he 4id, encountering, to his surprise, no less a person than Mr. Pinkey himself, sWelling like a frog in his editorial chair, as if he intended to eclipse some great, old, political ox, or burst his girth in the patriotic attempt. Some time elapsed before Lexington could bring Mr. Pinkey to touch on the subject which was the cause of his visit. "Mr. Cavendish," said Pinkey, in reply to Lexington, "has been here, but is gone again."  "But can you tell me where he has gone to, for I doubt that he has returned home? Indeed," continued Lexington, the last place one may expect to find Mr. Cavendish is at Cavendish House." "I am very certain," replied Pinkey,( that you will not   "4        ROSE MLTON: find him there at present." And then, with a wave of the hand, "He is gone to Camperdown." "Impossible!" exclaimed Lexington, in the surprise of the announcement. "I know that he is gone," replied Pinkey, "and that he must be now some hours advanced on his journey." This intelligence completely prostrated the plans of Lexing- ton for a time. He was at a stand. What was to be done? But why had Cavendish gone to' Camperdown? At length, a sudden thought occurred to him, and, turning to Pinkey, he said-- "Pray, inform me if the Governor, Drayton Hone, is in Camperdown?" "Yes," replied Pinkey; "I have just learnt the fact from little Toddy Thompson, who arrived in Afton yesterday from Camperdown, on his way to Mexico, for the purpose of fighting cocks with Santa Anna." This information aided the reasoning of Lexington very ma- terially just at the moment; for, in the midst of the darkness that surrounded his plans, he caught a glimpse of the sunshine rising up brightly in the distance. He now perceived the necessity of going at once to Camperdown, and, as he knew that Cavendish was a kinsman of the governor, he concluded that the most intelligible plan would be for him to proceed as fast as possible to Drayton Hone's and surprise Mr. Cavendish. But the distance from Afton to Camperdown, and the imprac- ticability of the roads, made it advisable for Lexington to pro- ceed on horseback; and, accordingly, he was ready to start in one hour from the time he left Pinkey House. He accom- plished thirty miles before dark, such was his anxiety to make good his promise to Rose. On the next day, he travelled un- til dark, passing over seventy-five miles; and, on the morning of the third day, he rode into Camperdown, and breakfasted'at Clark's hotel. After changing his apparel, and seeing his horse groomed, which he held to be the bounden duty of every *   A ROMANCE.           115 honest man, he inquired the way to Hone's, and- arrived there just as the governor had lighted a cigar to smoke himself through the business of the day. Drayton Hone was a descendant of General Robert Hone, of whom honorable mention is made in all our revolutionary histories, not only on account of his service in the field, but in consequence of the famous duel that was fought between him- self and general Christopher Gadsden. He was a bluff, jolly gentleman, of whom it might be truly said, that'politics were his being's end and aim-hot, fierce, and fiery. He was also distinguished on the turf and in the cockpit, like a good governor; but it was in figures of speech that Hone excelled; and, in fact, the report'so industriously circulated by his oppo- nents that he could not write his own name was a slander, for he could not only write his name quite legibly (if he had a goose-quilD, but, with the help of the Bible and "Weems' Life of Marion," he could concoct a passable letter, at least one good enough for a governor. But he well knew how in- jurious writing and reading are to the political prospects of a Southern gentleman. No man who aspires to distinction dare acknowledge that he owns a book, or is able to do more than sign his name. It was of him that John Randolph made the remark " that it was true, Drayton Hone could not write, be- cause he was never taught, but that his opponent, Simon Ber- wick, could not write because he was not teachable." To read anything, therefore, except a political almanac, was above his mark; but the signs of the political zodiac are as palpable to his vision as Gemini and Cancer are to the astronomer. It will be perceived from these few remarks that Drayton Hone was a model governor, gave dinners, made speeches, and, like the model statesman of an- ancient house, was not inattentive to his own applause. My relations with this gentleman hav- ing at a subsequent period become particularly intimate, I, shall defer a more minute description of his characteristic traits   "6        ROSE MLTON: to another occasion, when he shall be introduced with all the- honors. Well, Henry," said the governor, (' what brings you up to Camperdown? It's two months to bur races yet; but I shall have Green Sleeves in prime kelter for the match with Flirt- ilia."     ' * "I thank you for your inquiry," replied Lexington; "but, intruth, I have not come to attend the races." "Nor to see the match of cocks?" asked Mr. Drayton Hone. Why, what on earth could have tempted you so far from home, if 'twas not to see a race or a fight?" - "I may astonish you," replied Lexington, "by candidly stating that I have never attended a cock fight in all my life; and, as to horse-racing, it was the passion of my youth, but not the pride of my manhood, although I should like to see your string.' '"Come, then," said Mr. Hone, "let us walk out and see the nags." And so they did. They walked out and saw the nags, and particularly the two famous mares called Green Sleeves and Myrtilla. Then they criticized Little Cid, that was number one at a handicap; and then they admired the legs and tail of Frisky, the Maltese Jack; and then they played with four unhappy-looking beagles, called Moses and Aaron, Paul Jones and Old Charon; and then they scanned the proportions of Old Buckter, the Durham bull; and Sir Roger de Coverley, the Bakewell ram; and then they returned to the house, and talked of a variety of matters, but chiefly about horses, cocks, and dogs; for the governor was a man of the age, and knew that the age was an age of horses, cocks, and dogs. He then spoke of his farm, and praised his neighbor Rice ap Cotton, as a perfect master of the art of cultivating sweet potatoes. Hav- ing finished with the merits of Mr. Rice ap Cotton, the governor came to a pause, for he had run himself dry, like an old cow   A ROMANOE.           117 that had been milked too often; and then, as I said, there was a pause, "Pray, sir," said Lexington, "can you tell me if your kins- man, William Cavendish, has been in Camperdown recently or not?" "Yes, I can," replied Mr. Hone; "he was with me when you arrived-or rather, he had just taken leave-of me, intend- ing to proceed to Swansea, and from thence back again to Afton."             * "To Swansea! Why, he must have taken my road on his return just after I hadleft it." "What is the matter, Henry?" asked the governor. "Are you and Willie at loggerheads? Nothing like a fight, I hope; because, if it comes to that, I must arrange the meeting/' The reader may perhaps smile at the idea of the chief magis- trate of a State deliberately offering to become a party to a hostile rencontre, but nothing is more common; and, indeed, why should duelling be more obnoxious to public morals than cock fighting? It will be remembered by the scholar that the philosopher of old said that the only difference between a man and a cock was, that a man was a two-legged creature without feathers. Mr. Lexington explained. He was desirous, he said, to have an interview with Cavendish on some affairs that were more interesting to others than himself, in which his honor was engaged, it is true, but not in the sense which induced the belief of a personal issue between Mr. Cavendish and himself. "Ah, I see," replied Mr. Hone; " the old story-a woman in the case. I 'll swar, you young dogs are always quarrelling about the women; and, after all, they don't car a brass farth- ing about the best of you. But I suppose it's human nature, and we are the R's of old father Adam's estate. . I was once nigh getting into trouble myself about a girl who lived down near the salts, who wanted me to fight a man who had jilted "   "8 -ROSE MLTON: her; but I induced him to marry her. Tharr's extremes for you, murder or matrimony!" The good governor little knew that there was a striking coincidence between a portion of his remarks and those of poor Lord Byron, who tells us, in "Childe Harold," that "man is but a pendulum :betwixt:a smile and tear'"On the evening of the same day that he arrived, Henry Lexington once more mounted his horse, and set out for Afton.  CHAPTER XV. THE current of this history now returns to Hamilton and Plantagenet.- They regarded each other in silence after Lex- ington had taken his departure, the one wearing a look of pas- sionate scorn, and the other so much enraged at the conduct of his friend that he had actually lost the power of speech. What I he that had intruded his presence on a young lady, and ven- tured to smooth the path of difficulties for his friend, by care- fully removing every impediment and obstruction; he to be received in return not with fervent gratitude, but with con- tumely and contempt! It made the blood of the young sol- dier rise up with indignation and burn to the very roots of his hair. In this state of his feelings, he was for seeking imme- diate redress, and, had he acted at once, this history would come to a period at this place; but, luckily, the prudence which formed a beautiful trait in his character came to his aid on this occasion, and he paused as if surveying the field before him. It is at this moment that we return to Plan- tagenet. "I have availed myself of the first leisure moment which has occurred to me," said Hamilton; mildly, but with a look of settled resolution that indicated plainly enough the intrepid   A ROMANCE.          119 nature of his character, " to visit you on the subject of Miss Walsingham. You--must listen to me," he continued, as he noticed the impatient gesture of Plantagenet, "for we must un- derstand each other. It is unnecessary for me to repeat what has taken place between that young lady and yourself-your untiring devotion and solicitation of her hand in marriage; and you must acknowledge that she did not encourage your addresses, although she treated you with kindness. But this was not enough to satisfy your love-for her; you desired some more decided mark of approbation in your favor. Failing in this, you actually became distracted, and wished to destroy yourself by the hand of one whom you regard as a friend." Who told you this?" asked Plantagenet. "I demand the name of your author." " The name of my author," replied Hamilton, "is that of your friend, Cavendish. But let me resume. It was in this state of your proceedings, to obtain a decisive answer from Miss Walsingham, that I ventured to call on that lady and to plead your cause'-- "Did you venture to do this?" asked Plantagenet. "Be- ware, Hamilton! there is a limit to the bonds of friendship, which may be passed. Do you mean to say that you actually called on Miss Walsingham, and addressed her in my name? -offered me in marriage?" "Not exactly," replied Hamilton; "but you shall hear what I did say, and do. My object in calling on ]Hiss Wal- singham was not to offer, you in marriage, but to obtain her consent to accept of you, for I was perfectly aware that you had offered yourself already. This is the true statement of the case. You were on your knees, and it was only by my solicitation that she consented to raise you from the humble position you then occupied." "Go on!" said Plantagenet bitterly, "go on! seek out the vilest phrases, the most degrading epithets, apply them to me,   120        ROSE MLTON: and then beg me to return thanks for your mercy in not having slaughtered me with paper bullets." "It state the facts as they were-they are true, as related by me-and you shall not pervert them to meet your present pur- pose, whatever that purpose may be, for I am sure that you have been tampered with." Plantagenet sprung from his chair, and for a moment seemed to threaten Hamilton with personal violence, but the calm, collected manner of. the latter, acted as a foil to the im- pulsive pride of the first. "Am I a man to be tampered with?" asked Plantagenet. "Who would take the liberty of influencing my conduct? What I do, what I think, is of my own accord. I ask no man's opinion, and I care for no man's censure, where my own conscience is concerned." "Your conscience!" exclaimed Hamilton, with contemptuous coldness;- pray, let us talk of something that is intelligible." Fire flashed from the eyes of Plantagenet, when he heard this bitter taunt, and yet the inflexible manner of Hamilton was such a constraint upon him, that he dropped into his seat as if he had been shot through the heart. Creature of im- pulse, as he was, Plantagenet was aware that in dealing with Hamilton it was necessary to be cautious. "Why do you not then state," said Plantagenet, "your mo. tive for this visit? It surely cannot have been your intention to instrqtt me in the part I should act in my unfortunate dal- liance with Miss Walsingham. If such was your design, you will please consider that I am the master of my own actions, and that for those actions I hold myself responsible." "I do not consider you as being in the slightest degree answerable for your actions," replied Hamilton, "for at the present time you are not yourself, but somebody else; who that somebody else is, I do not know for a certainty, but it is certainly the person who has influenced you to act the part of a dishonored, not of an honorable man."   A ROMANCE.           121 "Hamilton," said Plantagenet, with a little of Hamilton's coolness in his manner, but a burning impatience in his looks, "if you knew all, you would not blame me for the course which I have chosen to pursue in this affair." "I do not know what meaning you attach to the word all, but this I do know, that you are acting in a. most shameful and disgraceful manner towards a young lady, whose character you have assailed without cause, and whose heart you have trifled with in a way that should blast your reputation as a gentleman forever."  "It is false!" cried Plantagenet, "and you know what you say is false. But you shall not taunt me thus with impunity. I have been trifled with by Miss Walsingham. My feelings have been outraged in the most cruel style, for she has trampled on me until she thought me of no more consequence than the vile dust of the earth. And during all the time she was acting thus-crushing my very heart-what was her con- duct elsewhere? Ha! you understand me, Hamilton! The guilty conscience, they say, needs no accuser, and I plainly perceive that you are aware of, the reports which have been recently circulatedi touching the character of Miss Walsing- ham, and that you believe *em to be true." "I believe them to be false," replied Hamilton, "and none but a villain Would believe a calumny like this, against a young lady whose life gives it the lie." "Do you call me a villain?" asked Plantagenet, between hi4 ground teeth; " answer me plainly, yes or no? Do you be- lieve me to be a villain?" "I have said," replied Hamilton, "that none but a villain would believe this calumny against Miss Walsingham. Where's your evidence? Do you sit in judgment on a human creature, and dare to give your opinion of her guilt or innocence, with- out being able to adduce one particle of evidence against her character? And yet," continued Hamilton, "you call yourself a gentleman." "*   122        ROSE MLTON: "And who dare say that I am not?" replied Plantagenet. "Bat I have evidence enough on this point-.. "Produce it!" cried Hamilton. "I dare you to produce your authority." "It is sufficient that I believe the report on the evidence I have heard, to be true.. It is a matter that concerns myself, and I shall permit no one to meddle with my affairs." "You will recollect, Plantagenet," said Hamilton, "that when I undertook this business, the relations of friendship ex- isting between us were of the tenderest nature. We have been school-boys together-our lives have been passed pretty much in the same society-what concerned ope interested the other. It was in consequence of this that I undertook your cause; have I not done so with your approbation, not exactly with women, but when your impulsive nature has led you to trespass on the paths of prudence, which old men seldom for- get or forgive? I acted, on the present occasion, from the best motives--from a regard for your friendship entirely-and now, what is my reward?" "Do you pause for a reply?" returned Plantagenet; "and shall I tell you all I know about this affair?" "But first," said Hamilton, "Cill me who told you of this calumny against Miss Walsingham. Why do you keep that a secret? Does it not occur to you, that the very fact of mak- ing a secret of your informant's name, you excite suspicion as to his veracity, and that there is some collusion for the destruc- tion of Miss Walsingham? Why not come out openly, and say: 'Cavendish told me these things."' "How did you learn this?" said Plantagenet; "had you heard this report against Miss Walsingham when you came - here?" "As to that," replied Hamilton, " the report is current all over Afton, and the authorship has been traced to Cavendish, for such is the statement of Miss Huntly." "I was not aware that Miss Huntly knew of these things,"   A ROMANCE.          123 said Plantagenet, evidently confused, for he had believed the reports against Miss Walsingham to be known only to Mr. Cavendish and himself. "But are you aware," continued he, "of the character of these reports?" "What have you heard?" asked Hamilton, "for I wish to know what can have incensed you so much, and had such ter- rible effect on your heart, which was entirely devoted to Miss Walsingham." Plantagenet here related the report concerning Miss Wal- singham and Mr. Middleton, in almost the very words that it had been told to Lexington by Miss Huntly, showing, evi- dently, that it had originated 'with a single author. Now, as Plantagenet had not seen Miss Huntly very recently, and as she had only a few hours before given Mr. Cavendish as her authority, there was no longer any doubt on the mind of Mr. Hamilton that Cavendish was the person who had communi- cated with Plantagenet on the subject. It should be men- tioned here that Mr. Hamilton, not having seen Rose Milton since her arrival in Afton, was not aware of her interview with Mr. Middleton, and of their visit to Miss Huntly-for as yet, indeed, this interview and visit had not occurred-he was, therefore, unable to contradict the story as told by Plan- tagenet. "You see, now, for yourself," continued Plantagenet, " how base has been the conduct of this woman. At the very time that she was enticing me on to matrimony-now inviting, and then repelling me--she was secretly, nay, openly, engaged in a criminal flirtation with Mr. Middleton! What do you expect of me? that I should still solicit her in marriage? Sooner than stoop to such baseness, I would perish! Nor do I fear the consequences of my conduct. I have determined on my course, and come what may come, I have resolved. that the name of Plantagenet shall not be degraded so long as I am its owner." "No power on earth shall ever make me believe," replied   124        ROSE 'MLTON: Hamilton, "that Miss Walsingham is guilty of the crime with which she is charged. My nature instinctively revolts at the thought. But as I voluntarily pledged myself for you to Miss  Walsingham, so now do I pledge myself to you for the integrity of her character and the purity of her conduct. We shall meet again." And so the friends parted! CHAPTER XVI. BURNING with anger, and mortified to the quick, Hamilton closed the door of Plantagenet with a hand .that was hot, and ready to strike for life or death; and, in truth, it is difficult to conceive of a situation more embarrassing or confounding. What was he to do? He asked himself that question a thou- sand times, as he hastened home, and every answer came with a determination to resent the affront to his wounded honor, for it was not merely the cause of Miss Walsingham, or her vin- dication, that now engrossed his attention, but he felt deep, deep down in his heart that, in consequence of Plantagenet's conduct, the recent interview with Miss Walsingham had be- come farcical and ridiculous. This feeling stung him until his very blood tingled as itthrobbed! He determined that some- thing must be done, but so strange and so sudden was the oc- currence, that he seemed like one "who was lost in a wood of suspicions." He must consult some one, but who should that some one be? He passed his own door, repassed it again and again,'and having made up his mind, hastened round to Lex- ington's hotel. Standing at the door of the hotel, was no less a person than Angus Scott, the landlord, who has already been introduced in these pages. He stood twirling and flapping a great Scotch   A ROMANCE.           125 pebble, in the shape of a watch seal, as if to balance himself from the preponderating effects of Abram Spitler's jokes, for that noted individual was standing on the banquette, directly in front of Angus Scott. Indeed, there was great virtue in that pebble, for it not only prevented Angus from losing his centre of gravity by falling forward (Burgundy overcoming Scot- land), but it also had the effect of preventing him from throw- ing a somerset backwards, in consequence of the violent inli- nation of his nose and his toes to turn up. His big bull ter- rier, and his little Scotch terrier, were crouched near the heels of this great potentate and both with their mouths resting on the floor, were looking intensely at "a little doggie" over the way, who was engaged in the heroic undertaking of transport- ing a big bone to his kennel, at the back of the little fruit shop, where one might have seen a very pretty girl, selling oranges, and sucking sugar kisses to keep her mouth in taste. Angus Scott and Abram Spitler were two of the notabilities of Afton; but, for the present, we must give them the cold shoulder, as our business is with Mr. Hamilton, whose sudden appearance seemed to have considerably astonished the land- lord and his friend; and they bowed themselves, and saluted him as if he were the Czar of Russia, instead of being a re- publican of good repute. It is true that-we live in a demo- cratic country, but it is equally true that however much the country may be democratic, its countrymen are as servile, and as obsequious as any citizen of London, or as Sir Pertinax Maesycophant himself, with his "Your lordship's most de- voted-I rejoice to see you," or his "my dear lord, I beg ten millions of pardons for leaving town before you." In reply to Hamilton's question, Angus Scott stated that he had not seen Mr. Lexington that day, as he had dined abroad, and had not since returned to his rooms. This information determined Hamilton to return home and rest his action for the present, instead of following it up with the spirit which was inherent in his nature. Every consideration, indeed,   126        ROSE MLTON: prompted him to this decision; his- recent friendship for Plan- tagenet, and the singular position which he occupied between the parties-a position the more mortifying from the very sue. cess of his overture to Miss Walsingham. On reaching home, Hamilton retired immediately to his chamber, locked the door, and threw himself on the bed; and there he lay, refusing admittance to any one, until the next morning. Had he been dreaming all that time? Yes, he had been dreaming, with a dreadful consciousness of existence, of that world beyond, the dread reality of life, which had sud- denly been discovered in his voyage round the circle of the passions. He had been dreaming of that world which had risen up like a new morn on the midnoon tf romance, and he now saw another morn and another sky, and that morn and that sky were the life of man, with his pride, his passions, and his power for good adld for evil. Two days elapsed before he was able to quell that proud and haughty spirit, for it was the struggle with himself that perplexed his soul. Nor in all that time did he take any food, not even a bit of bread; but, when he found his brain working too fast, and felt it throbbing like a mighty pulse, he relieved it by reading or writing, which last has the happy effect of re- lieving or diverting the mind from the reality of present misery. On the morning of the third day after returning home, Hamilton left his room very early, and walked down to the battery. A cool breeze was still blowing from the north, and taking his seat at the extreme end of the battery, he looked out upon the ocean beyond the islands, and at the ships in the harbor. What a strange fancy touched his mind as he gazed at'one of those great creations, a ship!"t If," thought he, "I could hide myself forever from the world by sailing in one of those ships, I would leave house and home and kith and kin- dred, and never visit this scene again. Beautiful! Oh, how beautiful is this scene, now that the day is dawning, and the'   A ROMANCE.           127 sun rising, and the cool breeze comes creeping, creeping in to refresh the earth and reinvigorate it with the breath of life! Beautiful!" And he shook back the locks from his brow as the breeze touched his temples. Oh, what rapture in that touch! How delicious I It cooled his brow, it gladdened his heart, it tranquillized his spirit, it subdued him, and it restored him to that health which had been trembling in the balance. The evening of that day he called at Mr. Walsingham's, requesting an interview with Fanny. He was told that she was quite ill, and unable to see company, but that Miss Milton would be glad to see him at her father's the next day at twelve o'clock, if he had no other engagement. No, he had no other engagement; and, therefore, he signified in reply that he would be certain to obey Miss Mifton's commands. Yes, he would be certain to be there. But what were his feelings when he turned away from that door? and what would be his feelings when he should meet Rose the next day? What was he to say? Should he tell her all? Reveal the unaccountable con- duct of Plantagenet, or conceal the knowledge of that gentle- -man's matrimonial defalcation at once boldly and honestly? But then the thought struck him with much force, on the same principle that burned children dread the fire, that he would, by mentioning this subject to Rose, be volunteering his services again, and just after the recent and bitter experience of Plan- tagenet's delinquency. And yet, something must be done. Lexington was still absent, unaccountably so to him; and, during the absence of that gentleman, Hamilton felt that it was necessary for him to adopt some decisive step in this busi- ness, as being due to his own character as a man of candor and integrity. He repaired, therefore, to Colonel Milton's at the appointed hour, and met Rose, who had only just a moment since returned home from Mr. Walsingham's. It was some time since these- two had met, and, as there had once been an affair of gallantry between them-and report said that Rose was not insensible of   128        ROSE MLTON: Hamilton's merits-their meeting was at first slightly con- strained; but the embarrassment gradually wore away, as the conversation took off the flutter of their hearts. They spoke of the beautiful morning, the Rossiter's paintings, the Italian minstrels, and Morgan's Deluge; and, after circling round and round, and round and round again, like two pigeons, they set.. tied down on the house-top of small talk; and finally, Hanil- ton, recognizing the necessity of breaking the ice, went at it with full force-as if breaking ice had been his amusement ever since-there was no telling when that was. a I have something to tell you, Miss Milton," said Hainil- ton, " that concerns your sweet friend, Miss Walsingham, most nearly; and yet it is of such a. nature that I can scarcely find words to convey the full effect of my meaning." "I am perfectly aware," replied Rose, "of the report to. which you allude, and it has caused so much anguish to Miss Walsingham that I fear her health is destroyed forever. I have not left her side these three days, and have scarcely slept an hour in all that time, in consequence of poor Fanny's ill- ness. But you seem to be astonished?" "I am more than astonished," replied Hamilton; "I am amazed at what you tell me! Is it possible that Miss Wal- singham is aware of that which I was desirous of communicat- ing to her?" "Is it not the report about Mr. Bay Middleton and Miss Walsingham that you are anxious to speak about?" inquired Rose, who now began to apprehend that there were more re- ports equally atrocious circulating through the city, and she looked at Hamilton as if dreading to hear some new revelation. "You must pardon me, Miss Milton," said Hamilton, "for speaking to you on a subject that is of the utmost importance to your lovely friend. It is a subject that I would not venture to touch at all, were it not that I was concerned in it, and that it is absolutely necessary to my own character that I should explain all the circumstances." And here, without more ado,   A ROMANOE.           129 Hamilton related the passionate attachment of Plantagenet for Miss Walsingham, and the extremity to which he was reduced by her refusing to entertain him with hopes of being finally successful in the prosecution of his sui . He then touched on his intimacy with, Plantagenet, and on the familiar terms which had Lever existed between the families of Walsingham and Hamilton. "In my desire, therefore," continued he, "to render a real service to the parties, I determined, of my own accord, to venture so far as to speak to Miss Walsingham on behalf of Plantagenet; not at his request, indeed, but as the only means I could devise of saving his life, for he had be- come a maniac in his love. My interview with Miss Walsing- ham was of such a nature that I conceived the possibility of her relenting in time to the ardent passion of Mr. Plantagenet; nay, her parting words, although they were full of delicacy, gave me little reason to doubt that, should Mr. Plantagenet make one effort more, he might possibly succeed in his enter- prise."- He paused to reassure himself, and hoping that Rose would relieve his embarrassment by making some remark; but she did not, for her whole soul was wrapped in the relation of Hamilton, and she was regarding him in utter and profound amazement. In a little time after my interview with Miss Walsingham," continued Hamilton, "I called on Plantagenet to congratulate him with the success of my mission, when he, for whom I had ventured so much, absolutely and peremptorily disclaimed my mission, and denounced Miss Walsingham as a base, abandoned woman." "He did!" exclaimed Rose, springing from her chair, and all on fire with passionate excitement. "And you did not crush the villain who dared to speak in these terms of Miss Walsingham?"She paused for breath, for, short as her question was, it had exhausted her; to such a pitch of angry 12   130        ROSE MLTON: bitterness had her temper been excited by Hamilton's narra- tive. "Had I done so," replied Hamilton, "I should have been equally to blame with Mr. Plantagenet, for I saw that some unusual influence had been brought to bear upon him; that, during my absence from his side, some false friend had been instilling poisonous reports into his ear, and that the poison had touched his heart. Was it not better, therefore, to reason him back to the path of duty? to open his eyes, if possible, to the slanderous nature of the reports to which he had given too easy credence? Was it not better, under these circumstances, to win him back and restore him to himself? I regarded him, at the time, as being little better than a madman; for his actions, ever since the interview between Miss Walsingham and himself at Mr. Lansdowne's, were so deranged that Mr. Lexington and myself had to be at his side night and day. You are now able to judge of the difficulty of my position, and can tell me as to the propriety of my making a statement of these facts to Miss Walsingham." "Not for the world!" exclaimed Rose; "not for ten thou- sand worlds! What is this? I see it all; and, now that you have told me of this occurrence, I know more of the actual plot against Miss Walsingham than you do. But the scene has changed since you entered this room, for it is no longer Mr. Cavendish, but Mr. Plantagenet that must be made to satisfy the wounded honor of Miss Walsingham. I would to heaven that Mr. Lexington were here with us at this momen4 for his assistance would be invaluable to us in this emergency." At this moment the door opened, and Mr. Lexington entered the apartment, booted and spurred, having just returned to Afton from Camperdown. sib'   A ROMANCE.           131 CHAPTER XVII. IT is necessary to pause at this point, and say something of the other noted characters of this history. And here the reader will naturally inquire what has become of Mr. Caven- dish, Where is he? and what is he after? It is this mys- tery which I propose to solve, and, with it,- relate something which it is necessary to reveal before we proceed in our narra- tive. Some of the traits of William Cavendish, such as his fend- ness for low company, his frequenting the playhouse, his fami- liarity with players, and his habit of indulging, occasionally, in the style of conversation which is peculiar to that class of people; his use of cant phrases from such dramas as "Bon Ton," "Tom and Jerry,"The Devil to Pay," "The Deuce is in Him," and particularly Mrs. Centlivre's "Bold Stroke for a Wife"-I have already mentioned in these pages. I have also stated that he was addicted to gambling, a vice far more common among young men who have been raised entirely in cities than is generally imagined, and which seems'to be a natural conse- quence of our system of education, which estimates a game of billiards as infinitely more intellectual than the "Cosmos" of Humboldt. But there was another trait in his character, or rather pas- sion of his heart, which ate into his heart, and that was re. venge. Exposing himself continually, by his habits and asso- ciates, to the cold recognition or contemptuous sneer of gentle- men, whose blameless lives and spotless purity of character rendered them unassailable openly, he cherished in his heart the sleepless spirit of revenge, and nursed his wrath, like the sullen dame of Burns, "to keep it warm." This was the se-   132         ROSE MLTON: cret pivot on which his character turned; but, powerful as it was, and sternly as he dealt his blows in the dark, yet his spirit was so antithetically mixed, that one who only saw him in his jesting mood, would scarcely believe it possible, that the idle and'apparently frivolous character before him, was capa- ble of maturing schemes and executing plans that required, not talent, merely, but genius in their author. It was this portion of his character which had won the favor of Plantagenet in their youth, and such was the powerful cord of youthful sympathy, that no reports, no evidence, could weaken Plan- tagenet's friendship for Cavendish. He saw with his eyes, it is true, but he did not believe in his heart that Cavendish was a most abandoned and worthless profligate. The chief associates, the chosen friends of Cavendish, were a sdt of Break-o'Day boys, who ate oysters at Muggridge's- yelled in the streets at night; blew cow horns in Mazyckbo- rough, to the infinite delight of James Legare's dogs; wrung off knockers from  door-plates; transported sign-boards; made horses run away by shooting them with shot from a quill; and nightly serenaded a gentleman named Bee, with a frog concert.* I shall mention the names of a few of these young Rapids, who "kept moving" in Afton, namely: Rat Bee, Anson Ball, Miles Brewton, Clarence Cockburn, and Abram Spitler, who was the Grimaldi of the company. They were the " hearts of * As many readers may not know the meaning of a frog concert, I shall state that each one of the serenaders took a part, which was distinct from the others, imitating the various hideous noises which proceed from our frog ponds at midnight. Each of these sounds is distinct and different, one from the other; and as performed by the Break-o'Day boys, may be divided into six parts, as follows: 1. Fry Bacon. 2. Tea Table.  3. Pea-ang. 4. Bloody Noun. 5. Boom Boom. 6. Tom Bee. Each of the performers kept steadily to his individual portion of the grand oratorio, and thus gave to the con- cert an effect that was indescribably ludicrous. It had the effect of killing Mr. B.; 'at least his friends said so.   A ROMANCE.           13 gold" that cheered the spirits of Mr. Cavendish. It is. true that he would sometimes run away, and hide from them in profound disgust, but when the Rapid spirit, or the Break o'Day spirit, returned upon him, which was generally in a day or two, he would return to their society, and eclipse them all, in shoot- ing horses, blowing cow horns, and singing frog concerts. The truth is, that William Cavendish was born of the aristocracy-- his great ancestor, old Burlington, having gone into the famous battle of Poictiers, riding by the side of Edward, the Black Prince-and, however strong his inclination was to associate with these idlers, there occasionally rose in his heart a stronger inclination, and that was, to return to the upper crust, from whence he sprung; and thus it was that the antithetical spirit which I have mentioned as forming his character, made him a kind of pendulum, that was ever swinging between the higher and lower grades of society.  It was in the circle of the old r6gime that he encountered Fanny Walsingham, who had just entered her first season, and, much to the dismay of "the drapery misses,"* was carrying the tide of conquest on the topmost wave. For one whole season had Cavendish been the humblest slave of Miss Wal. singham; for one whole season had he imagined himself the special favorite of her affections; for one whole season had he hugged the delusion that she, the young, the beautiful, the bright, was destined to be the lovely Mrs. Cavendish, of Hol- kar Hall, and the mother of a long line of little male and female Cavendishes. But, alas, for the hopes of man! Ever since the time of old Homer, "misery and man" have been the theme of poets and philosophers, but not of fortune tel- lers, for Cavendish had gone very secretly to Madame Salvo * Young ladies, who have been furnished by their milliner with a wardrobe upon credit, to be repaid, when married, by the husband. But, in this system, the gentlemen are quite as reprehensible as the ladies. 12*   134        ROSE .MLTON: to ask his fortune, and she had given it to him in a lump as big as the miners dig in California, telling him all that was bright, and promising a future so sweet, that Cavendish actu. ally smacked his lips, as if he was in a very extensive field of the very earliest strawherries. Arming himself with this big lump of fortune, Cavendish believed himself a second David for luck, and most anxiously hoped that some amatory Goliath would come down from the mountains of the Philistines, armed with brass, to encounter him in such a cause. But as he saw no such competition, he began to fancy that he had the race all his own way, and that Eclipse was first, and the rest nowhere. It was in this state of his prosperity that Cavendish attended the party at Walton Basset, to which we have frequently alluded in these pages, and it was there and then that, to his utter amazement and inexpressible astonishment) he was so severely repulsed by Miss Walsingham, that he began to doubt whether he was himself, or whether he was somebody else, or whether he had been dreaming, and had just waked up, or whether; in short, he was a little, just a little disguised by a double dose of old port. But when all doubt was ended, when all dreams were expound- ed, when every uncertainty was made certain, he was a spec- tacle for all young gentlemen who have trusted too implicitly to their lump of fortune, and to the marvellous revelations of fortune tellers like old Madame Salvo, who 'gave away more pretty girls to young men than the world ever saw, except the number of young men she gave away to pretty girls. O, Madame Salvo! But from that moment Cavendish became the deadly enemy of Miss Walsingham. He swore that she should be humbled, and sink as low in the dust as himself, and he determined to use every effort, and employ every means to attain this end. Poor, dear Fanny! little knew the storm she was about to en- counter when she repulsed that bold bad man; and well for her she was unable to read the scroll of fate, for if amid the festivi-   A ROMANCE.           135 ties at Walton Basset she could have seen in a magic mirror the scenes that were to involve her name, and fame, and fortune, in ruin and utter and hopeless desolation, her eye would have been blasted, and her hope, and health, and happiness, crushed forever! Nor did he work like a butcher, but combined his manceuvres with the skill of a general on a field of battle, cal- culating chances, and estimating results; and, as it was at this period that Plantagenet first began to exhibit a preference for Miss Walsingham, there was no doubt that he was urged on to that enterprise by Cavendish himself, who hoped, by means of Plantagenet, to humble his proud beauty. In selecting Plantagenet for this purpose, Cavendish trusted to that gentle- man's known fickleness, or want of constancy, in love affairs, and he did not doubt that after Plantagenet had won the affec- tions of Miss Walsingham, that she would become "the six- teenth Mrs. Shuffleton." It must not be supposed, however, that Plantagenet was the tool of Cavendish. Far from it. He had long seen, and known, and admired Fanny Walsingham, but as Cavendish was making chase after that sail, he kept quietly on a wind, in pursuit of Miss Isabella Huntly, with whom he had been flirt- ing since the season commenced. But with the fickleness for which he was proverbial, he had suddenly tacked, and permit- ted that sail to navigate the ocean possibilities and probabili- ties ilone, and it was thus, that, just when Cavendish had been repulsed by Miss Walsingham, Plantagenet had retired from the pursuit of Miss Huntly. It was no difficult matter, therefore, when we consider the intimacy which existed between Plantagenet and Cavendish, for the latter to direct the atten- tion of the first to Miss Walsingham, by discoursing of her many attractions, personal and' pecuniary. But with all his sagacity, Cavendish did not perceive that there are times when courtships commencing in fit, and to while away an idle hour, ripen into the reality of love, and bind the parties for life in the silken bands of matrimony. And it was not until the ball   136        ROSE MLTON: at Lansdowne's that he became alarmed. But he saw enough that night, notwithstanding the cold demeanor of Miss Wal- singham, to warrant him in the belief that if two mortal beings were in love with each other, those two mortal beings were Fanny Walsingham and Richard Plantagenet. His determi- nation was taken immediately. They should never be mar- ried! He swore by every oath, and on the Testament and the holy Evangelists, that Fanny Walsingham should never marry Richard Plantagenet. But we must pay our respects to Miss Huntly. It is neces- sary to trace her antecedents. That she was a woman of un- doubted talents there can be no question, but she exhibited so little scruple in revenging her wrongs, or her fancied wrongs, that her talents failed to be appreciated, except by those who delight in human torture, and to whom no music is so exqui- site as the crushing of a human heart. She had full scope for the display of her great powers, for her family was wealthy, and she freely moved in the first circle, as her birthright, and the first circle of Afton is just as difficult for a poor devil to enter,-as it is for a poor devil of a school-boy to master the puzzle called the walls of Troy. It is true some bold Alex- anders cut the Gordian knot, and defy the old moths, but, then, there are very few Alexanders in Afton. The most intimate friend of this lady, when I first became acquainted with her, was a certain Miss Quash, who was-a per- feet human book of heraldry. She knew everything in that line, from the time that old Broughton stormed the Craven bastion, down to the era when Gen. Gadsden, Mr. Rogers and Peter Munclear, used to meet in 1766, and plot treason under the shades of the Liberty Tree. In fact, I am almost afraid that she knew everything! History? at home. Poetry? at home.  Politics? at home. What didn't she know?   I don't know. And then, what a tongue to garnish her brains! I aver, on my honor, that she has been known to commence talking on Monday morning, and on the Saturday following, at   A ROMANCE.           137 twelve o'clock precisely, her tongue stopped for the first time, she not having, in all that period, either 'ate, slept, or winked as much. It was no wonder, then, that Aristotle said of her --I beg Aristotle's pardon for making him say such things three thousand years after his death-that, by all the dreams of his philosophy, Miss Quash would never have the gout, would never be bald, and would never stutter; all of which sayings were miraculously fulfilled in the person of that won- derful lady. It was to this interesting remnant of a lost world, that Miss Huntly always applied for advice in cases of emergency. When, therefore, Mr. Plantagenet gave her flag the go-by, and went off in pursuit of Miss Walsingham, the charming Isabella was quickly closeted with her friend, and consulting with her as to the ways and means of revenging herself for the insult, for such was the word she applied to the conduct of Mr. Plan- tagenet. "I knew it, Bell," replied Miss Quash, " knew it would come to this, and I told you so long, long ago. I told you on the last night of the last year, when you were speaking of Richard Plantagenet, to beware of that young-man, for his father before him, and his grandfather before him, were all given to trifling with the affections of ladies. I remember his grandfather when a boy--it was during Grant's war--" "When?" asked Isabella, opening her eyes, and stretching them very wide. "It was during Grant's war against the Injins," continued Miss Quash. "Oh, pray, my dear friend," quoth the gentle Isabella, "let us talk of the present times, and of that which concerns me at this very moment. What am I to do in this affair? How shall I revenge myself for the insult put upon me by Mr. Plantagenet?" "Have you a male friend?" asked Miss Quash, looking up   138        ROSE MLTON: at Isabella with an under look, and with a goose glance, indi- cative of cunning. "I have many that call themselves my friends," replied Isabella. "But have you any one in whom you can put your trust- you understand me? ' Perhaps I may regard Mr. Cavendish in that light," said Miss Huntly. "Oh, dear me!" exclaimed Miss Quash, "I remember, now."                       ' "What do you remember?" asked Isabella, with great solicitude. "Why, the last time I ever saw his father, the lad was only so high," and Miss Quash placed her right hand very near the floor, "and now to think that he should have a son grown up to be a man. I do declare!' "I was not aware that you knew Mr. Cavendish's father," replied Isabella. "Oh, yes," said Miss Quash; "that- is, I knew him when he was a baby. And so you know his son William? I do declare! Well, if you know him, and if he resembles his  grandfather, then he is just your man for this enterprise. You say, Bell, that Mr. Plantagenet has insulted you, and you are desirous of revenging yourself on him. You tell me, also, that Mr. Cavendish has been insulted by Miss Walsingham. Now, the matter stands thus. You wish to be revenged, and so does he. Very well. Can you invent a little bit of scandal --a very little bit?" "There has been a festival at Walton Basset," said Isabella. "That's enough," replied Miss Quash; "that's sufficient, as the fly said to the ice cream. If you could only invent a little story about Miss Walsingham and Mr. Plantagenet, it would accommodate all parties, by destroying them, for the scandal would kill her, and destroy his character as a gentleman for- ever. In her death, Mr. Cavendish would be revenged, and   A ROMANCE.          139 in his destruction you would be revenged. Can anything be plainer than this? Stick to scandal, my child, it'is the breath that purifies the atmosphere of cities, and without it how could we women live?" This was the advice given to Isabella Huntly by Miss Quash, and, acting on this advice, Miss Huntly sent a note to Mr. Cavendish, inviting him to join her, at home, in a dish of talk and tea. This was the occasion chosen by Miss Huntly for breaking to Mr. Cavendish the scheme she had concocted for destroying the reputation of Miss Walsingham, for if she could succeed in this, she would blast the prospects of Mr. Plantagenet, and thus would she be revenged on that gentle- man for his desertion of her at a time when she thought he was entangled in her artful snares. She correctly judged of the effect her communication would have on Mr. Cavendish, as he was burning to retaliate on Miss Walsingham the slight he had received from her at Walton Basset. It was accord- ingly arranged, by these worthies, that Mr. Cavendish should circulate the report touching the conduct of Miss Walsingham with Mr. Middleton, although Mr. Cavendish was well aware that Mr. Middleton was not present on the occasion. He therefore gave currency to the scandal by every artful contriv- ance, telling it everywhere, and enlisting the aid of his pro- fligate associates in the base' and infamous falsehood. Nay, he even ventured so far as to corrupt the mind of Mr. Plan- tagenet himself, as we have already seen, and then, perceiving that the scandal had taken wind, he prudently withdrew from Afton, going first to Camperdown, and from thence to Beau- mont and 'Swansea, where he was sojourning at the time of Mr. Lexington's return to Afton, from his unsuccessful pur- suit of the base detractor.   "O        ROSE MLTON: CHAPTER XVIII. WE must now return to the charming Rose Milton. 'It will be recollected that we left her with Hamilton and Lexington, the latter having just returned to Afton. He came at the mo- ment when Miss Milton would have given worlds for his pre- sence, the recent revelations of Hamilton having imbued her with the belief that Plantagenet had become the principal figure in the-picture, overshadowing all the other revilers of Miss Wal- singham. She well knew that the conduct of Plantagenet, at this emergency, would have a powerful controlling influence on the sentiment of society, and that as submission to his culpable caprices was out of the qesstion, it was necessary to act ener- getically and promptly, for the heroic spirit of the blind old poet was yet alive and flowing in her veins. "I have just been talking with Mr. Hamilton," said the beautiful Rose, greeting Lexington with exquisite grace, "about this atrocious scandal, and rejoice that you have come to aid us with your precious advice, for I fear, at times, that my nature impels me forward, when I should be surveying the prospect before us." "But you forget," replied Lexington, "that my late absence renders it impossible that I should be in a position to give you advice; even if present," continued he, bowing to the beauti- ful Rose, "I should not presume to occupy a position so ex- alted." "I doubt the correctness of your conclusion," said Rose, blushing in acknowledgment of the compliment, "for I have heard it said that those counsel best who counsel at a distance." Here Hamilton turned to Lexington, and recounted the sub-   A ROMANCE.          141 stance of his interview'with Plantagenet, as he had previously done to Miss Milton. "You are aware," said he, in conclusion, "of the part I acted in this business; you know the motives that guided me in ven- turing to act as the minister of love, and what I desire is your advice as to the course I should pursue in this deplorable emergency. The world, I know, will censure me, and say with its usual charity, that I have been served right, for inter- fering with other people's business; and yet were it not for our  occasional efforts to assist our friends, what value would one place on the ties of friendship? It would be a rope of sand! But yet, the sternest accuser that I have is my own conscience, which does not approve the course I acted in behalf of Plan- tagenet, and I am now convinced that there are themes-and love is one of them-that friends should leave untouched, as the fruit of the forbidden tree in our garden of Eden." These remarks were uttered in tones of touching pathos, and Rose felt that, however imprudent he had been in solicit- ing the hand of Miss Walsingham for his friend, Hamilton had acted from motives of the highest honor, and feeling this, she was charmed even more than she had previously been-if that were possible-with the character of the young chevalier. Indeed, it was only just and natural, that one so pure and proud as herself should admire those traits of character, which elevated Hamilton to a position that made him the "cyniosure of neighboring eyes," for in himself was concentrated the. essence of southern chivalry-a spirit ridiculed by fools, but admired by patriots. The appeal to Lexington affected that gentleman deeply, for he was the warm friend of Plantagenet, and in the present mystery which wrapped his conduct, he was extremely averse to taking any measures that approached extremity. He ad- mitted all that Hamilton had told him. "I deny nothing," said he, "but I cannot, even with all my friendship for you, I cannot believe that Plantagenet is at pre- 13   "2,        ROSE MLTON:  sent in his proper senses. We all have'our moments of mad- ness--'when our mother chides'--and shall we now, notwith- standing the truth of all you say, shall we now condemn the friend who has shared our heart, spurn him from our society, and mete to him the punishment due to one entirely criminal? Has he no redeeming virtues? And may we not, by appeal- ing to those virtues, not only save him from ruin, but elevate him once more to his place in our hearts? To me there is more pleasure in redeeming a friend, than in publishing his folly or punishing his crimes. I confess to you candidly, that I would not sit in judgment on a friend; there are villains enough in the world to inflict the stern penalty of the law. Let us leave to them the honors and the rewards of punish- ment. But among friends we should, if possible, discard the passions that disgrace mankind, and touch the cord of friend- ship with a kind and feeling hand, for it is these friendships- these little circles, that supply the place of family ties-where we must seek for the virtues which adorn and elevate our human nature, above the great and promiscuous mob that .we call the world, which has no heart to feel for other's wo, and without the empire of the heart, what would we all be, but so many statues, cold and cruel?" "I acknowledge the truth of much that you have uttered," replied Hamilton,/ and I know how much you must feel on the present occasion, for -I have myself been wounded to the quick in this disastrous affair. My position, at the present time, leaves me no choice, or, at best, only a choice of dif- ficulties. It is true, indeed, that Plantagenet's onduct seems to be the result of madness, but I assure you that he is at this moment as much in his senses as either you or myself. -You will say, if this be so, why, then, not appeal to him?.--nay, you have suggested that course as the best means of restoring him to himself, and of rectifying the wrong that he has com- mitted. But he will tell you that he has committed no wrong, and that if so, it was by implication. Thus, you perceive, he will   A ROMANCE.          143 strike his dagger to my heart a second time, for I have already appealed to him-urged him, by every sentiment of honesty and of honor, to disregard the scandal against Miss Walsing- -  ham, and vindicate my zealous overture in his own cause- but, he is fixed in his resolve, and I regard the intercourse between Miss Walsingham and himself as being terminated. Nor did I neglect to touch the chord of friendship in my inter- view with him, but it gave back no sound responsive to my touch." When Hamilton had finished speaking, Rose looked intently from one to the other, as if lost in astonishment. She was surprised to discover that there was a difference of opinion on a subject which, to her view, admitted of no difference at all; and when Hamilton spoke of difficulties, she almost lost that love for him which she had ever entertained. In her opinion, there was not the slightest difficulty, if either Hamilton or Lexing- ton would act with the promptness, energy, and honor, -which usually distinguished them. But we must not forget that Rose regarded the whole difficulty as the friend of Fanny Walsingham; and that some pardon must be granted to Hamilton and Lexington, if they appeared irresolute, for they i  had been ever the warm and cherished comrades of Richard Plantagenet, who, until this scandalous transaction, had borne a character in the aristocratic circles of Afton that might'have been coveted by the proudest paladins, whose ancestors had fol- I  lowed "Billy's Banners" to England from Normandy. Rose knew well the importance of giving an early direction to their thoughts, and seeing at a glance that they were unwilling to act without the greatest caution, she determined to speak for her friend, and vindicate her course with all the energy of her soul. "- Difficulties!" she exclaimed, looking at Hamilton with those eyes that might have charmed an -anchorite, "where is the choice of difficulties? Do you not perceive that the only   "4        ROSE MLTON: difficulty consists in permitting Mr. Plantagenet to act at his capricious will in this affair? And if he is suffered to do this, what is the consequence?  Why, the destruction of Miss- Walsingham. That will be the result-that must be the re- sult, unless you and Mr. Lexington resolve to place the matter  in its true light, and compel Mr. Plantagenet to keep the ground that you have chosen for him. The necessity of the case admits of no other alternative. He must do this, or give his life as an atonement for the injury he has offered to the wounded heart of Miss Walsingham. It is your duty--it is the sacred and the bounden duty of Mr. Hamilton to see that no wound is inflicted on Miss Walsingham's honor, in conse- quence of the interview which he held with her, when acting for Mr. Plantagenet." "I feel it!" said Hamilton, "I feel it even more fearfully than you can do; and I feel all the agony, the mortification of my position, for without my aid and assistance he would not now have it in his power to wound the honor of Miss Walsingham. I feel it here!" said he, placing his hand on his heart, and his head fell on his breast, and the big tears rolled down his manly cheeks. "If you feel it," cried Rose, with passionate energy, "what must Miss Walsingham feel? Her heart has been crushed, trodden on like a worm, by a set of vile conspirators against her good name, and now another pang is added to her misery. And who sends that pang?-who plants that dagger?  Was it an enemy? No. It was one who had sought-and haply won-her hand in marriage. O God! that I might plead her cause, and vindicate her virtue and her worth. But no! I am a woman. I have a heart, but no voice for the public ear- no hand to hold the avenging dagger!"  "Hold," exclaimed Hamilton, seizing the hand of Rose, convulsively; "what would you have me do? Would you wish me to vindicate the cause of Miss Walsingham, and de. fend her from the shafts that have been aimed at her honor?"   A ROMANCE.           140 "I would have you bring Mr. Plantagenet to justice!" said the impassioned beauty, "bring him to justice, and make him stoop as low as the vilest thing that breathes. Do it and I will be your slave for seven times seven years. Do it!"' she cried, with all the energy of her heart and nature, and stamp- ing on the ground in the burst of passion, that entranced her, "and I will marry you-claim it of me!" Hamilton raised the hand he held to his lips, and as he kissed it, said in the gushing enthusiasm of his heart, "I can try!" employing the very words of a brother soldier at the battle of Niagara, as a sure presage of victory. But thereqwas one in that-room who thought that, whatever the errors of Plantagenet may have been, yet, in consideration of his family, of himself, and of the strong and lasting friend- ship which had existed between them, it was their duty to exercise every caution in approaching him on a subject so deli- eate, and to exhaust every method of conciliation, and every effort for redress, before proceeding to extremities, which would effectually close the door against conciliation, or reconciliation. fHe well knew the proud nature of Plantagenet, and that the first suspicion of a design having been -formed to force him from his position, would not only make him hold out the more tenaciously, but induce him to assume the initiative in his conduct. But he now saw that regret was vain, and that the only course for him to adopt would be to soften, if possible, the harsh controversy which -he saw impending between Plan- tagenet and Hamilton. And thus is man! Who could have believed, only a few days since, when Hamilton was seeking the hand of Fanpy Walsingham, for Plantagenet, that-but I must not anticipate. I must state, however, that Lexington did not blame Rose for the part she acted in requiring Hamil- ton to pursue this affair. He knew what women are capable of doing for each other, that a wrong to one s a wrong to all the sex, and he fully recognized the duty, nay, the necessity 13*   "6      -  ROSE MLTON: of Miss Milton's doing something to vindicate the honor of Miss Walsingham. But still, notwithstanding his admiration and respect for Rose, he regretted her illimitable power over Hamilton, at least, on this trying occasion. CHAPTER XIX. HAMLTON and myself having taken our leave of the beau- tiful Rose, proceeded to my hotel, where we parted, the one to arrange his plans against Plantagenet, and the other to change his costume, stained as it was with the dust of travel. As several days had elapsed since I had left my apartments, the letters and notes, addressed to me from all quarters, had swelled into a huge pile, that literally covered my dressing table. But whilst I was dressing, a note fell from the hand of the little marble Venus, who stood sentry on my table, and on taking it up, it occurred to me that its immense size and pecu- liar shape indicated something significant. I therefore broke the seal-it was a Terpsichore-and discovered that it was a note of invitation from Cecil Burleigh, the rich merchant, to a ball that very night, at Burleigh House.. It was already late, and I felt very much fatigued from the posting to and from. Camperdown, but a strange presentiment crossed my mind, as I held the note in my hand, and glanced at my face in the mirror, that there was a shadow at Burleigh's which would- not, indeed, strike terror to my heart-but point the way by which I might be able to save the lives of two very dear friends, and rescue a lovely woman from unmerited disgrace. It was the middle of night when I entered Burleigh House, and the dancing circle was "chasing the glowing hours with flying feet." I had paused near the door, to observe the con- dition of things, when young Wilmot Tidyman came up with   -A ROMANCE.           147 a message from Mr. Burleigh, requesting that I would join him, as he could not leave the circle that surrounded him at that moment. In compliance with this request, I approached the circle aforesaid, and greeted the master of Burleigh House. And here I must say something of this gentleman, and of his friends who composed the group. Cecil Burleigh was a mer- chant of considerable fortune, all acquired by his own indus- try, for he had come to Afton a charity boy, and for the first few years of his doing business in that city, had been com- pelled, from sheer poverty, to take his meals at a chop house, and sleep on a bale of blankets in his employer's store. Reared in the school of adversity, and armed by its resources, he en- tered the great world, prepared for battle, and had triumphed over its difficulties; and so great was his success, that in a few years he had accumulated one of the largest fortunes in the South. Taking fortune at the flood, he had floated on to fame as well as fortune, for the discriminating public, which always rewards success, had showered its honors on him, and he stood at this moment among the most honored among the senators who make our laws, and -Construe the constitution of our fathers from plain English into low Dutch. The knowledge of such a gentleman was of commercial affairs entirely. He was a master of the laws that regulate its trade, and he knew that what benefited one merchant, was equally beneficial to the commer- cial community. But, beyond this, he knew nothing, he saw nothing. To him the principles of political economy-apart from the direct effect of banking operations on mercantile mat- ters-were a total blank. In a word, he was a man of one idea, which is generally the case with all men who represent a class, particularly, and not the community generally; and hence it is, that merchants never make statesmen, for they view every- thing, even honor, by the money standard, and we are told, on very high authority, that the moment calculating avarice touches the sovereign power, the nation is ruined. But, although his knowledge as a legislator was small, his influence as a man of   "8         ROSE MLTON: wealth was unbounded, for in cities generally, no less than the rural districts, wealth and wisdom are synonymous. The posi- tion, then, of Mr. Burleigh, was impregnable as the rocks of Gibraltar, in the opinion of the great world of Afton, but in Mr. Burleigh's own secret opinion of himself, he was an up- start. He felt, in himself, that he was not a fixture; that if his wealth should take wings to-morrow, according to the usual luck of commercial men, that his reputation and his position would be ,gone forever. It was in. consequence of this that he had endeavored to fortify his position againstthe assaults of for- tune, by marrying Augusta Beresford, who was a sweet daugh- ter of the old r6gime. On the strength of this alliance, he launched at once into those-magnificent displays which made Burleigh House so famous for its beauty and its chivalry. Here and there, it is true, one might have heard a sarcasm about upstarts, but the pride of the old aristocracy had to sub- mit, and the intruder, by preserving the equanimity of his temper-for he was a man of considerable tact and prudence -had secured Jhimself; at least as long as his money lasted. But his prudence did not always predominate, for the pride of wealth, in the. high born, or the low born, will peep out at times, or, to use acommon phrase, "will show itself." What, then, was Mr. Burleigh's pride--the secret pride of his heart? It was to eclipse the, Honorable Mr. Lansdowne, by giving what may be called opposition parties, and by filling his rooms with people who dated their origin to William the Conqueror, and, perhaps, even to Caius Julius Caesar. He was, therefore, generally regarded as the rival of Mr. Lansdowne, much to the mortification and indignation of that great man, who, as "a lord of the soil"-for we have said that he was "spacious in the possession of dirt"-regarded himself not only as a "fixture," but a kind of commonwealth of con- siderable stability. And then, too, as a matter of course, each of these great persons had their partisans, blazing suns with twinkling satellites, who sung the praises of their patrons, and   A ROMANCE.           149 finally created two rival parties, the Lansdownes and the Burleighs, which threatened to involve the entire community of Afton in sackcloth and ashes, as the factions of Montague and Capulet did the society of Verona, in the days of Romeo and Juliet. By the side of Mr. Burleigh stood a gentleman, whose figure and face were almost boyish, but whose fine gray eyes, flashing as he talked, would have redeemed a plainer face. This was Robert Y. Hayne, who was so well known for his ready and graceful eloquence. He was one of the popular orators of the South, but beyond these occasional displays, he was a man of no very great mental accomplishments. His talents were fine, and his learning just of that kind which makes one a good committee man, or, as Stewart-the slayer of Sir Alexander Boswell-said, "a well-informed country gentleman." But he made the most of these materials, having, a certain smart- ness of address that was really captivating, and his conversa- tion, touching as it did almost exclusively on politics and poli- ticians, was always interesting to those whose thoughts turned on public affairs. But his character was one of great integrity, and it might be said of him, as Jefferson said of Monroe: "His soul might be turned wrong side outwards, without dis- covering a blemish to the world." He shone for many years in Afton, as a bright particular star, and when that star set in death-alas, too soon! the name of Hayne was extin- guished. These gentlemen were conversing with. a young man named Philip York, a descendant of Robert Simons, one of "Marion's men," and of whom the anecdote is related by our chroniclers. It is told that Simons, and his friend Withers, were sitting by a camp fire, during-the times "that tried men's souls," and, perhaps, their stomachs-for cow pens are decidedly objection- able-when Withers, noticing the bump on Simons' nose, said: "Bob, if you had not that big bump on the bridge of your nose, you would be a handsome young fellow."   150)        ROsBE MLLTOW; " Well," replied Bob.. "I think I can knock it off with a ball," remarked Withers. "Do you?" asked Bob.  "Yes!" replied Withers. "Shoot!" said Bob. 'And bang went the pistol, and off went the knob, and that 'tubular bridge was destroyed for ever, leaving Simons to carry about with him,:for-the next -fifty years, the ugliest face that was ever carried by the son 6f a woman. It was from him that Philip York inherited his good looks, but for his-name we must go back to the Yorks of Old England, and the times of the Roses. But, although Philip York was no beauty, he could talk at times with' considerable ability, and just when I joined the ,group he was engaged with Hayne, in the current of a notable -argument. "Why is it," he asked, "why is it that we have not a single writer in the South who is worth a farthing? You may say, -there is, or rather was, Dr. Ramsay; 'but I tell you, in reply, -that whatever may have been his credit once, his house has failed, he has no credit. Ask George Bancroft, who rejects -his authority, as being less reliable than Daleho's! In poetry, who is our representative? You cannot name one who has a single spark-one scintillia-of genius. In letters, generally, who is your lieutenant? Alas, there is not one whose head may not pass for Mr. Secretary Crowningshield's, as it was described by Randolph. 'He has a head,' said old Roanoke, "and so has a pin.' No. We are all planters-all politi- cians. Born aristocrats-born statesmen, by the grace of God. 'From sixteen to sixty, it is all one dead fiat pine barren region of intellectual sterility. At sixteen, the school-boy orator holds fast his breeches with both his hands; and at sixty, the old politicians chew on wisdoms past, and totter on in busi- ness to the last, 'As weak, as earnest, and as gravely out, As sober Lanesborow dancing in the gout.'   A ROMANCE.           151 "No. Tell me nothing about our scholars. We have no scholars! No. The South cares nothing, literally nothing, for anything on the earth, or above the earth, except cotton and politics; and hence it is, that planters and politicians are your great men; and hence it is, too, that your politicians, being planters, can unite on no project for their mutual benefit and general welfare, for the planter, instead of loving his neighbor as himself, hates him with a hatred known only to neighbor- hoods, or to the descendants of the third generation, whose fathers were foes." "I would rather perform great deeds," said Hayne, than describe the great deeds of others." "Why, there it is," replied Col. York; for he was a great militia officer, being aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief of thirty regiments, who paraded in umbrellas and walking sticks; "and in doing so, you leave yourself at the mercy of another. Who writes your histories? who describes the deeds of our heroes? Why, it is only recently, that I read the opening paragraph of the Life of Marion, in a certain book, that con- tained sketches of celebrated characters, in which the writer apologizes for introducing the life of a man whowas so ob- scure I Marion so obscure I am out of all patience." "You may discourse ever so wisely," said Hayne; "but the' most prevalent sentiment in the southern heart is, that author- ship is degrading; that there is something, particularly about poetry, that is effeminate; and there is not a boy in our streets who is engaged in marking cotton, with a brush and a pot of lampblack, who does not look with infinite disdain on what is: called a poet. True, he will read a sonnet, and applaud a good song, to the very echo; and will even, if he hap a leisure moment, read the poems of Byron, Scott, and Moore; but it is equally true that, however he may wonder at the genius of the men who struck the cord that binds the mighty, the uni- versal heart of man, and made it resound with a power that moved the world, like those peals of thunder that leap from   152         ROSE MLTON: crag to crag, and shake the Alps; however much the power and the beauty of poetry may charm and fascinate him, he will still, in spite of all this, regard the man of letters as an object to be avoided. "One hates an author that's all author, fellows In foolscap uniforms turn'd up with ink, So very anxious, clever, fine, and jealous, One don't know what to say of them, or think, Unless to puff them with a pair of bellows; Of coxcombry's worst coxcombs e'en the pink Are preferable to these shreds of paper, These unquench'd snuffings of the midnight taper' This arises in part from the condition of our society, in part from the dissociable habits of literary men, and in part from the fact that literary men generally occupy no recognized position in society; and there are few persons who do occupy these positions, who would risk their loss for the uncertain gain of literary honors; for there is a fortune in letters as in all other affairs. Suppose a case-you write a book, you spend time, labor, thought, erudition, in its composition; proud of your victory, for it is indeed a great victory to write a good book, you seek a printer, and your work is published. What next? Why, you expect it to be read and admired; and if read and admired, that you will be honored, admired, caressed, and treated with distinguished consideration. Now, casting aside your expectations, what is the actual fact? Why its blemishes, not its beauties, are studiously sought after, culled from the work, and republished, with a bitter sneer, or, according to the custom of English criticism, damned with faint praise. Thisxis your reward I Do not think that I am mystifying you, or that I am uttering these remarks in a carping spirit; but-if you consult your own happiness, the great and primal object of every human thinking being, then abandon all thoughts of ever becoming an author, particularly if you have any other resource, for you had better take poison at once, and die un-   A ROMANCE.           153 known, die unpitied, than ever write 'on compulsion'--that is, for your daily bread. There you will find the depth of degradation and the sink of misery. That will be your reward! Do not think that you can arrest, or resist the current of pub- lic opinion in the South, it is too strong for you, and will send you down to death with a broken heart!" "' But may it not be worth the experiment?" said Lexing- ton; " we may have little cause for congratulation at present, but we know, and all history teaches us, that the greatest results spring generally from the most trivial causes, the habeas corpus, for instance, and many others that will readily occur to you." "I have reflected upon all that," replied Hayne, with great earnestness, "but there are natural causes at work in the world ' that shape our ends, rough hew them as we will.' I produce the following examples in support of my argument. In agricultural affairs, the South produces and the North con- sumes; in literary matters, the North produces and the South consumes; and say what they will about the want of education among us, I hold it to be incontestable, that the greatest art is the art to govern; and who, let me ask, who govern like the southern gentlemen? Notwithstanding that we are out-voted in Congress, and in the electoral college, yet the reins of the general government have almost always been in the hands of southern men, and the machine of government has been pro- pelled by them, from the dawn of the Revolution down to the present time." Colonel York bowed respectfully to the remarks of the youthful Senator, but seemed to-intimate in his reply that the art of making speeches in the Capitol, was not quite equal to the art of writing a good book. "But, after all your labor," continued Hayne, " how does it tell in comparison? A politician makes a speech in Congress that costs him little labor; but if it happen to strike the popular heart, he is borne in triumph from one end of the "   154        ROSE MLTON: country to the other-he lives, he breathes, as if in some en- chanted palace, and feels in his heart what is 'the applause of senates to command;' and now, unshadow the apartment of the literary man-what a contrast! There sits the man of books, writhing with torture in the mighty pang that rends his heart; he is cut off from the world; has no recognized social position; is shunned by his fellow creatures; and frequently, too frequently, flies for consolation to the bottle for relief from the merciless thought that fires and burns his brain. Reflect on this in time! It has been said, that I am not good for a crisis; and it may be true, for I would never advise a measure so obviously impracticable as the establishment of a southern literature, for it does not suit the genius of the southern people." "You speak of the genius of the southern people," replied Colonel York; "but may not its genius be moulded by the adoption of some enlightened educational system?" "The great art of the lawgiver," replied Hayne, A consists in this-he should adapt his laws to the genius of the people, not strive to mould the people to unnatural laws. It is the genius of the people that he should study, and you have a remarkable instance in the history of Greece. The States that composed the Grecian republic were as distinct in their habits, manners, customs, and temperaments, as the States that form our own republic; and how different, how dissimilar, were the laws framed for Athens by Solon, and those framed for Sparta by Lycurgus! The reason is obvious. The genius of the Athe- nians was entirely different from the genius of the Spartans; and hence the wisdom displayed by their lawgivers in framing such laws as would best conduce to the happiness of their respective commonwealths." These remarks led to a long argument on the different poli- tical and social systems of Greece, Rome, and finally of Eng- land, in which Hayne quoted the remark of Cicero, that a   mie -    A ROMANCE.           100 mixed republic, that is, a government of three estates, would be an impracticable government!  The discussion of these political questions being interrupted by a stunning strain of music, Colonel York turned away and joined several -young men who were talking in a corner, and who were well known to me as a junta of fierce politicians, that met nightly to swear eternal fidelity to the constitution, and to die in the last ditch, when the tide of oppression should overflow their country. I was still regarding the junta when my eye rested on the figure of Mrs. Elizabeth Ball, the mother of "the drapery misses." She matronized the poor things! introduced them to balls and parties, and to young men who, having nothing else to do with their money, than to support needy young women, were caught in the toils of this mother of the maids. In her train on the present occasion, were four blooming beauties, poor, but not proud, particularly to rich young men. The first of these drapery misses-and her ward- robe was finished like that of the others by the matron-was Rosalie Howard, fair and foolish; Louisa Granby, stout and stately; Henrietta Calvert, cute and killing; and Helen Love- lace, who was so thickly laced and ribboned, that she looked as if she had been covered with gum, and rolled through Mrs. Savage's fancy store-but that's a fact. In the neighborhood of these interesting young ladies, I noticed a party of equally interesting young gentlemen, who seemed to be speculating on the fortunes in the field; and this too was a fact, for they were a junta of tuft hunters, who used to meet weekly at De La Crusce's, for the purpose of discuss- ing the amount of property owned by the belles and beauties of the season. They had a president, and secretary, and a treasurer; in fact, they were organized as a club, which was called the {"Fortunatus." They supported themselves by gambling, until they could win a fool with a fortune; and were a most formidable body of men, if impudence and ignorance have any titles to power oJdominion. The most noted of these   156        ROSE MLTON: were, Robert Suffolk, Reginald Cobham, John Berkeley, Ralph Neville, and James Audley. They mingled occasion- ally with the dancers, by way of showing themselves, like so many peacocks, for they were dressed in all the colors of the last new fashion; but mingle as they might, they were sure to turn up somewhere in the vicinity of the great fortunes, the lovely girls whose papas owned two, or three hundred slaves, and one, or two, or three thousand acres of cotton land, Having surveyed these interesting-phases of our social sys- tem, I was returning to the noble host, when my ear caught the words," Let me have the. honor of introducing you to Miss Augusta Hurry Skurry, of Skurry, the beautiful sister of Henry de Skurry, of Skurry." Heaven have mercy on my soul! There was no escape, and I was compelled to bow to' Miss Augusta Hurry Skurry, of Skurry, and her brother, Henry de Hurry Skurry, of Skurry! "It is very warm," said Mr. Henry de Hurry Skurry. "Yes," said I,-" but perhaps you have been dancing?"' "No, I have not, upon my honor," replied Mr. Henry de Hurry Skurry. "Augusta, my dear," said he, addressing his sister, "don't you find it very warm?"1 "No, I don't," replied Mies Augusta; "on the contrary, I'm rather chilly." ' Mr. Lexington will take you to the dance, my dear," said Mrs. Wharncliffe, looking to me for my assent, but I had metal more attractive elsewhere. "I am engaged, just at present," said Lexington, slipping away from the Hurry Skurrys, and approaching the belle of the evening, Cornelia Cornwallis, sister of James Mann Corn- wallis, whose adventures have been mentioned elsewhere.* "I have to thank you," said the modern Cornelia with ex- quisite grace, as she recognized my salutation, "for the 'Lord of the Isles.' It is really very beautiful, and I am quite in * In the Memoirs of Lexington.   A ROMANCE.            157 love with Edith of Lorn. The great minstrel is certainly the most romantic. of all the poets since Shakspeare; and it seems to me that he is the bard to please a woman-he knows how to touch the heart." "That's the secret power of poetry," said Lexington, " and in that power who shall surpass Sir Walter? But it is really wonderful how little he is known in this country, in his really great character, as a metrical romancer! His novels, his prose romances, have overshadowed his renown as a poet, and so completely, that I once heard a gentleman, who had read all of Scott's novels, ask, in amazement, on hearing him men- tioned as a poet, what poems Scott had ever written?" "Ah!" exclaimed the fair Cornelia, smiling, "no woman would ever have asked that question; for who, what female heart has not been wrung to rapture by the songs that gem his poems?  And what can surpass, for sweet and simple beauty, his description of the Lord .of the Isles, sailing for Arran's Isle- "'Thither their destined course they drew; It seemed the isle her monarch knew, So brilliant was the landward view, The ocean so serene; Each puny wave in diamonds rolled, O'er the calm deep, where hues of gold, With azure strove and green. The hill, the vale, the tree, the tower, Glowed with the tints of evening's hour, The beach was silver sheen; The wind breathed soft as lover's sigh, And, oft renewed, seemed oft to die, With breathless pause between. O who, with speech of war ard woes, Would wish to break the soft repose, Of such enchanting scene!' "What do you say to that description? Can anything sur- pass it? One can see the little diamond wave,  we have "*    158         ROSE MLTON: seen them, rippling slowly along the snowy beach! And then the breathing of the wind-what a lovely image!' "Scott was a true poet," observed Lexington; "and as such his power over the heart was illimitable; in sooth, the poet's power is not simply over the heart, but the head, for what moralist, what statesman, what philosopher, has such influence over human destiny--over the rise and fall of nations? The French Revolution has been attributed to the poetry of Rouse- seau and Voltaire. In fact, there is no power that pervades the world so universally, and so irresistibly as a song-it is to' the world at large, what the drum is to the soldier, now stir- ring to strife, now melting to mercy."* "The power you attribute to songs," said Miss Coimwallis, "reminds me of Burns.  It is his songs that make his famous name, for after Byron, whatever we may say, yet the opinion of the many, the general voice, has placed him incontestably so near the highest rank, that he may well claim a seat by the side of Scott and Moore." "I wonder to hear you-say this," replied -Lexington, "for Anacreon Moore is the darling of your sex, and I think I may * It is necessary, however, to state that the origin of the French Revolution has been attributed to other causes, and among these, to the Queen, Marie Antoinette. "This angel," says Mr. Jefferson, in his Memoir, "as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some smartness of. fancy, but no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her will, eager in the pur- suit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, or perish in the wreck. Her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with those of the Count d'Artois, and others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness and dauntless spirit, led herself to the guillotine, drew the King on with her, and plunged the world into crimes and calami- ties which will forever stain the pages of modern history.

A ROMANCE.          159 say with perfect truth, that no poet ever was so generally ad- mired, nay, adored, by women, as the author of the 'Melo- dies' and Lalla Rookh.'" "You mistake me," replied Miss Cornwallis; "I did not elevate. Burns to the position of Moore, and I have no doubt that if it was put to the vote, and no voters allowed but young ladies, that Anacreon Moore would be elected president of Parnassus by acclamation." "I am glad to discover," said Lexington, laughing, "that your Parnassus is a republic, for, generally speaking, all ladies are despotic--for them there is no staff like the rod of empire 1" "Do you think so?" asked the fair Cornelia, smiling, and as if half suspecting that Lexington was right. "Look," said Lexington,"' at Victoria, Isabella, and Donna Maria, in England, Spain, and Portugal-nay, from the ear- liest times to the present, Victory has ever been represented in the shape of a woman; thus proving the truth of Byron's line:- '--pomp and power alone are woman's care! "If we come down," continued he, "to the present from the past, and from foreign courts to our own, where shall we find one to rival, in pomp and power, the peerless daughter of the Roman hero, except the fair Cornelia, who rules our hearts by the wand of her matchless beauty!" and, rising from his seat, Lexington offered his hand to the belle of the evening, and ledher to the dance. "What are you dreaming about?" asked Miss Cornwallis, who noticed the fit of abstraction which had come over Lex- ington, after the dance was over. "Ah," continued she, "I see now; you have been fascinated by the eyes of the lovely Celestinb Queensbury--and there goes my rod of empire!" Celestine Queensbury! That name made me start. I had seen her whilst dancing, but only like some beautiful dream, that floated along my imagination; but strange, wherever I looked, there-still there-was the image of that sweet crea-   160         ROSE MLTON: ture, who seemed to have become a part of my being, by some mysterious power of association. Who shall say that there are not unseen threads, that link man and woman ajs firmly as hooks of steel? Why is it that two ships, in a calm at sea, will approach and touch, if the calm continues? Is there not a certain- sympathy,.a power of attraction, existing in all the works of God, from man himself to the inanimate ship on the ocean? Was she-was Celestine Queensbury the shadow that had crossed my vision when I was, dressing for the ball? There was something mysterious in my sympathy for that lovely creature-" the mind, the music of her face," had be- come, as it were, a part, a portion of my heart, and yet I had never had any very particular acquaintance with Celestine Queensbury! But she rose up before me like a star of morn- ing-a vision of my buried love! When I raised my eyes, I saw that she, too, as if attracted by some secret power, was gazing at me. To move, or breathe, under the power of that fascinating eye, I found was utterly impossible, and that agony of the spirit, which I fondly hoped had been conquered, and subdued by plunging once again into the vortex of society, now came back upon me, and made me tremble in that festal hour like an aspen leaf. How like, and yet to be alive! The same eye, the same lip, the same cheek, the same glance, which gives you all the soul in a single volley. And what had I to do in a ball-room at such a time? and with such thoughts throbbing through my brain? Wounded as I had been by the cruel stroke of fortune, which had destroyed all I loved on earth, why came that vision against my eye, and at such a time? It was impossible for me to protract my stay in the room after seeing Miss Queensbury-for her face was my destiny- and, therefore, excusing myself as well as I could to the cap- tivating lady with whom I was ever interested and amused, I retired from the party and returned to my hotel.   A ROMANCE.          161 CHAPTER XX. AT noon, the next day, Plantagenet entered the apartment of Lexington. They had not met for some time, but so much had transpired in those few days, which touched the honor of Plantagenet, that he received a cold and formal welcome, merely, from his friend, for such, indeed, was Lexington, not- withstanding the inexcusable conduct of Plantagenet. He was aware that the resolution of Plantagenet was not occa- sioned by caprice, but that he had yielded with too much facility to the malignant aspersions cast upon Miss Walsing- ham by Cavendish, and at a time when he should have repelled those imputations and insinuations with scorn and contempt. But who shall trace the current of love? Are we not told that its course "never did run smooth?" Was not Lexington himself a victim to its dread decrees? Why had he trembled at the sight of Celestine Queensbury? It was this, and his own recent sufferings, that made him tolerate the conduct of Plantagenet, trusting that by a little careful management he might be able to restore the mind of Plantagenet to its healthy tone, and induce him to retrieve the error of his conduct. "I have called to see you, Lexington," said Plantagenet, "for the purpose of asking your advice in a matter that annoys and mortifies me exceedingly." He paused, noticing the constrained air of Lexington, and then resumed, as that gentleman bowed in reply, as an act of civility merely. "If I have intruded on you," and the blood mounted to his cheeks, "I have only to repair my error by withdrawing," and he rose from his chair with the proud bearing of a prince.   162        ROSE MLTON: "You have not intruded," replied Lexington; "but I can- not say that I am very happy in seeing you." "Indeed!" said Plantagenet; "I may then infer that you too have condemned me for the course which I have deemed it necessary to pursue on a recent occasion?" "Plantagenet," said Lexington, "let us deal openly, let us understand each other. If there is anything I abhor, it is disguise, where honor is concerned." "I trust," replied Plantagenet, "that you do not intend to insinuate I disguise the truth? Am I to infer that this is the meaning of your language?" "I mean just what I say," observed Lexington, "and you will pardon me for the remark I made, when I remind you that, in our last interview, you would not reveal to me the name of your author for certain scandalous reports, derogatory to the fair name of a lovely girl." "I could not gratify your request at that time," said Plan- tagenet, "because I had rashy promised not to yield the au- thor's name. But if the knowledge of his name is the only bar to our conference, I am ready to gratify you; the name of the gentleman who informed me of the reports in question, is William Cavendish." "I have for some days been aware," replied Lexington, "that Mr. Cavendish was the base libeller who poisoned your- heart against Miss Walsingham, and I have also been aware that he has fled away from Afton." "Impossible!" exclaimed Plantagenet, "for I saw him last evening." "Why, then he has returned," said Lexington, "as he must be aware, from the reports of his spies, that the scene is changed; that he is no longer an object of vengeance to the friends of Miss Walsingham, but that the man he duped by false reports is now, by his capricious wilfulness, the sole centre of that vengeance." It was to discuss this very point that Plantagenet had called   A ROMANCE.           163 on Lexington, for he had been told by Cavendish, at the in- stance of Isabella Huntly, that a plot was being formed for his destruction; and that Hamilton, instigated by Rose Milton, was the instrument selected for his destruction. "If you mean, by these ambiguous terms, to wound my feelings," replied Plantagenet, "I can only say that such epi- thets ill become the man who has ever professed himself to be my friend, and, therefore, I shall pass them by without re- sentment or retort, and come to the point, without disguise. Will you pardon me for touching on a subject of so much deli- cacy, not merely to myself, but to you, who from all accounts, and, indeed, from your own behavior on the present occasion, have become interested to a degree that warrants me in regard- ing you as being identified with one of the parties?" "I have identified myself with the cause of Miss Walsing- ham," replied Lexington, "only so far as the vindication of her character from the malignant aspersions of Mr. Cavendish is concerned, and to effect that object, I have exerted all the zeal of my nature." "If I clearly comprehend your remarks," said Plantagenet, "I am to understand that you have confined your hostility to Mr. Cavendish himself, merely?" "You are correct in your interpretation," replied Lexington. "Forgive me, then, my dear friend," exclaimed Plantage- net, seizing the hand of Lexington, and pressing it with fer- vor; "but how could I doubt you? The friendship which has so long subsisted between us, could not surely be broken up at once, without some explanation of your motive." Lexington did not withdraw his hand from the grasp- of Plantagenet, but the latter perceived that there was no answer- ing sympathy in that touch of hands, and he felt the awkward- ness of his position more painfully than ever. At one mo- ment, and as he felt the blood burning at his fingers' ends, he resolved to quit the room, and let the current of events roll on, and overwhelm him in its destructive career, heedless of its   164        ROSE' MLTON: consequences, and despising its dangers. But there was a gleam of common sense, which would shine out in all the stormy skies of this wayward son of genius, whose capricious- ness was not the result of iniquity, or viciousness of .temper, but resulted purely from the intensity of his imagination, and that quickness of feeling which made him sensitively alive to the slightest impression. But when the first ebullition of pas- sion had worked itself free, he became calm, collected, and consolidated, if I may apply such a term to the conflicting passions of one man. Plantagenet," said Lexington, calmly and mildly, "it is necessary that you should see this matter in its true light. I have said that my zealous co-operation with the friends of Miss Walsingham had for its object the punishment of Mr. Cavendish, but if you infer that I do not feel the greatest in- dignation against those who have given currency to his infa- mous defamation, by their conduct, you labor under a very grave mistake." "What do you mean by the word conduct?" inquired Plan- ,tagenet; "do you insinuate that I have given currency to the reports in question '? "Exactly," replied Lexington; " you have hit my meaning exactly, and now we understand each other." "It is a libel!" exclaimed Plantagenet; "I have circulated -no reports against Miss Walsingham; and the man who in- sinuates that I have done so --- "Plantagenet," interrupted Lexington, "pause ere you pro. ceed with this language; you are in my own apartment, it is true, but I shall not brook indignity here or elsewhere; and moreover, you have sought this interview, for the purpose I presume, of justifying your conduct. But what is your posi- tion? Have you examined it yourself? If you place the slightest reliance on the testimony of Mr. Cavendish, and if you act on that testimony, do you not aid and assist him in defaming the character of Miss Walsingham? Pause ere you )    A ROMANCE.           165 proceed further in this conversation. Reflect on the position you now occupy to that lovely girl? Why is it? From any- thing that has occurred, between you to mar your prospects? No. ButJ on the contrary, a mutual friend, one who had 'grappled iyou to his heart with hooks of steel,' fearful of your reason, ventured, in the heroic spirit of friendship, to plead your cause, and gained a verdict, when you had forsaken the field, and was flying in hopeless, helpless misery." "Will you not listen to me?" interrupted Plantagenet. "I now ask," said Lexington abruptly, " what is the posi- tion you occupy, not only to Miss Walsingham, but to Mr. Hamilton? Influenced by the insidious arts of Mr. Cavendish, you have repudiated all alliance with Miss Walsingham, and have involved Mr. Hamilton in a position that demands the amplest atonement at your hands. He cannot, and he will not, rest under the stigma you have inflicted." "The stigma I've inflicted!" interrupted Plantagenet; "what stigma have I inflicted on Hamilton? The position he as- sumed was injudicious; he volunteered in matters of the most delicate nature existing between a lady and myself, unauthor- ized, unsought, unasked, and now determines to hold me accountable for the result of his officious interference! Was anything ever more preposterous? Might I not, under the same pretence, involve the whole of Afton in inextricable con- fusion-pleading for one, volunteering for another, and acting as a kind of attorney-general for all despairing lovers?" "You may speak of this affair as if it was a jest," replied Lexington; " but your real friends, those who understood your position to Miss Walsingham, and that your madness in seek- ing to destroy your life was the result of despair, will not only -acquit Hamilton, but hold him in the highest esteem for his gallant and friendly overture in your cause." "I cannot subscribe to your opinion," said Plantagenet; "no one has a right to act for me, or to pledge my heart, as if it was a pawn. There are certain subjects too sacred even 15   16       ' ROSE MLTON: for the hand of friendship to touch, and love is one of these. That I did love Miss Walsingham, warmly, wildly, passion- ately, I shall not deny. She was my idol! and I worshipped her with a devotion that entranced my soul." "Why, then," said Lexington, "why, then, have you de- serted her thus suddenly, thus wantonly? What have you ever seen in her behavior to authorize your suspicion? The infamous report which was told you, has been proved to be false-the offspring of malignant jealousy; and yet, you still persist in your resolution founded on a scandal so false, so fla- grant, so flagitious!" "Lexington," replied Plantagenet, " are you not aware that, in affairs of love, we are guided by passion, not by reason? How can I reason on such a subject? The first, the faintest trace of suspicion, is enough to destroy, and forever, the warm- est love that ever man bore for woman. I have, indeed, never seen aught in the conduct of Miss Walsingham, save the most exalted purity; but it is enough for me that she has been tainted by the breath of suspicion, and I may reason forever, and still forever will the suspicion of her virtue overwhelm me with shame and mortification. You now see the state of my heart, and its feelings towards Miss Walsingham." "Why, then, have you sought this interview?" asked Lex- ington sternly. "I have done so in consequence of certain intelligence which has recently reached me," replied Plantagenet. "It came to your knowledge last' evening, I presume," said Lexington, alluding to the return of Cavendish to Afton. "You are right there," said Plantagenet; " for it did reach me last evening for the first time, and the intelligence is this; that I am to be punished for my contumacy. Am I right?" "' I must request that you first tell me what you have heard," replied Lexington; " and also who is your author, for doubt- less my name has been mixed up with this business in a man- ner to cause a portion of' your suspicious nature to be excited   A ROMANCE.           167 against me. In dealing with suspicious persons it is necessary to be circumspect." "Had such been really the case," replied Plantagenet, "you would not now see me your guest, for I would scorn to renew our friendship under such circumstances. No, Lexing- ton  I have never had any cause to doubt your friendship, unless your coldness on the present occasion may indicate that the ties which have united us so warmly, and so firmly, have at length been sundered." "What are you to expect?" replied Lexington; "what can you expect, when you avow that your actions are not founded on reason, but on passion merely?" "When I said that," observed Plantagenet, "I spoke of love-the love that ma. bears for woman; not of the friend- ship which exists between man and man. But I see that you have resolved to condemn me, and I shall have to bear your judgment with philosophy, if it be possible for me to play the philosopher." "You have condemned yourself in the opinion of every rational being," replied Lexington; " for what man, what gen- tleman, is not concerned when an indignity is offered to the sex?" "Indignity!" exclaimed Plantagenet, springing from his chair with passionate emotion, "what indignity have I offered to the sex? It is false! I have never insulted a woman in all my life. I have been their victim, and am now suffering from their tyranny. Indignity!" The contrast between the two was striking, for Lexington neither moved, nor stirred, nor blanched, before the impetuous anger of the fiery Plantagenet. Had Lexington forgotten him- self, or sunk into anger, the blood of those proud young cava- liers would have poured forth like water. "You have forgotten to state the intelligence you have ieard, and the name of its author," observed Lexington calmly, when Plantagenet had resumed his seat.   168         ROSE MLTON: "Lexington," said Plantagenet, struggling to resume his self-possession, "I almost despair of having any justice from you, at least so long as this cause of irritation remains to wound us. I will not, however, forget myself by yielding to unjust, or ungenerous sentiments. It was in consequence of my cherished regard for you that I came here this morning, to ascertain the truth of a report which reached me last evening; and it is this, that Hamilton, as the champion of Miss Wal- singham, has determined to challenge me to mortal combat. The name of my informant is Mr. Cavendish. Is my intelli- gence true?" "I regret, extremely regret to reply," said Lexington, "that your information is so far correct as concerns the inten- tion of Hamilton. Having stated this," continued Lexington, "I must also state my conviction, that his determination pre- cludes you now-as you are aware of it-from taking any step touching your relations with Miss Walsingham, or from any explanation to Hamilton, that may seem to be an apology for your conduct. The interference of Cavendish has destroyed the hope I entertained of amicably adjusting this difficulty, between Hamilton and yourself at present, for now that you are aware of his intention, it will be wrong for you to take any step in advance. You must wait his action." "Wait on his action!" exclaimed Plantagenet with fierce indignation. "Wait on his action! How dare he, how dare any man, conspire to take my life? I shall not rest on his action. I am no tame or passive instrument to gratify the vengeance of a woman. Nay," he continued passionately, ' I will myself assume the initiative." "I beseech you by all the ties of friendship," said Lexing- ton, "that you will permit me to engage a friend, who shall represent you in the negotiation which may ensue between Hamilton and yourself." "Negotiation ' said Plantagenet bitterly-' negotiation!   A ROMANCE.          169 Do you think that I shall negotiate with the man who, at the instigation of a woman, has sworn to take my life?" "You wrong him, Plantagenet, on my soul you wrong him. It is not the desire, it is not the remotest wish of Hamilton to shed your blood. The whole scope of his action has this extent merely, to obtain reparation for the wrong which he conceives you have done to a virtuous woman. Any other con- struction that you place upon his determination, will be false, for I know the opinion and the position of Hamilton. Calm yourself. The fiery nature of your temper has led you to believe that a deep scheme has been formed for your destruc- tion, but I assure you on my honor, that such is not the fact." "Have you not told me that Hamilton is about to challenge me to mortal combat? Whence this haste, this quick, this- sudden determination? Do not deceive yourself! He is act- ing, not for himself, but for another, and that other-a woman! Are you so little versed in the human heart, in our human nature, as not to know that, when a woman calls for vengeance, blood follows the cry, and flows in torrents? It is this that makes me indignant-that Hamilton should stoop to be the tool of a woman! As for my life, he is welcome to it; but what will he gain by taking it? Can he add my life to his own, and lengthen out his span of years on earth? No! What then will he gain by my death? honor, reward, emolu- ment, credit in the state, distinction in society? No! The blood he sheds will still adhere to his hands, it will stain him, and taint his line to the third generation. And in that dread hour, when his death shall come with its hollow eye and bony hand-but I forbear. This is no time to be prating! I must be in action. Action' is life. Adieu!" and in another mo- ment this impulsive mortal, burning with wounded pride, with fiery eye and throbbing heart, was on the street, and hastening with rapid steps towards the suburbs of the city. 15*   170        ROSE MLTON: CHAPTER XXI. "EXINGTON had followed Plantagenet to'the street, hoping to make him pause in his mad career; but failing in this, he determined to see Colonel York, and solicit him to become the medium of communication between Plantagenet and Hamilton. He lost no time, therefore, in calling on that gentleman, and stating every particular and circumstance necessary to explain the difficulty. "It strikes me," said Colonel York, in reply to Lexington, "that you are the most proper person to arrange this quarrel, and to pacify the parties. With Hamilton and Plantagenet, I have just that acquaintance which is acquired from meeting occasionally in the same circle of society; what influence, then, could I have, nay, would it not seem rather indelicate for me to approach them on such a subject?" "The very complexion of your intercourse with the parties, is a certain guarantee that your solicitude for their welfare will be treated with respect," replied Lexington; "but as to my- self, I cannot act, from the fact that the parties are my friends. This, it is true, may appear strange; but in a case like this, a personal friend should never interfere directly, as his good intention will be defeated by rousing the suspicion, or the jealousy of one or both of the parties. A personal friend is, therefore, out of the question; and as you are well known to the parties, I see no difficulty in your obtaining access to them, and of compromising the quarrel." "Have the parties chosen Their friends?" asked Colonel York. "I do not know,' replied Lexington, "but I trust not, as in that event the difficulties of an adjustment would be insur-   A ROMANCE.           171 mountable, the seconds being generally imperious and imprac- ticable-indeed, if there were no seconds, there would be few duels." Colonel York laughed, and, looking at the books which com- posed his fine library, selected one and read with inimitable humor the description by Major Andre of the famous fight which occurred in 1778, between General Robert Howe and General Christopher Gadsden.* The reading of this sketch led to a discussion on duels generally, and their fatality, Colonel York stating that these private combats were compa- ratively more fatal than battles, and he instanced eighteen duels that had been fought within his personal knowledge, nearly all of which had terminated fatally. With, the conclu- sion of this statement, Lexington rose to take his leave, having exacted a promise from Colonel York, that he would endeavor to arrest the belligerent proceedings between Hamilton and Plantagenet.  It is necessary that we should now trace the movements of Plantagenet. His usual resource under difficulties was Mr. Cavendish, and therefore he turned his steps in the direction of that gentleman's elegant mansion. He had not proceeded very far up King's Street, when he encountered no less a per- son than Rose Milton, who had that moment stepped out of Madame Budo's jewelry shop, as he was passing. The en- counter was for a moment only; but what a moment! He paused, as if about to insult her; but, preserving her dignity and self-possession, Rose passed him with the bearing of a Martia, who "towers above her sex." This ineffable hauteur * The first verse of this ludicrous description is as follows:- "It was on Mr. Percy's land,t  At Squire Rugeley's corner, Great H. and G. met, sword in hand, Upon a point of honor."-Yankee Doodle. t Between Cannonsboro' and the Lines.   172        PROSE MLTON: inflamed him still more, if, indeed, that was possible; and, with a breast all on fire, he hurried along the street, speaking to no one and seeing nothing, in the blind tempest of his passion. Proceeding thus, it did not take him long to arrive at Caven- dish's residence. He passed the door, kicked over a little black boy who was nodding in the gallery, or rather piazza, and entered the sitting-room. But he saw nothing of Caven- dish. He rung the bell-pull; he seized it as if he had caught something at last, and rung until he wrung the handle from the rope, and almost wrung his hand from his arm. At length an old woman in the yard, who had been pelting a bantam cock all the morning with chips to make him stop crowing, and who seemed to have nothing else to do, the bantam as well as the old woman, now hobbled up the steps and answered to the summons of Plantagenet. "Where is your master?" asked he-; but the old woman did not know where her master was. "Not know where your master is? Has he been here? Does he live here? Answer me, you old she devil! Answer me, or I will choke you to death!" But the old woman persisted in declaring her ignorance of her master's status, nor did she know if he had been at home; but she was equally positive that her master did live there, for that was his house, and his own home, too. "One never knows where to find him," exclaimed Plan- tagenet. "He is always in some hell amongsblackguards, and "gambling away his inheritance!" And throwing himself into a chair, he scowled at the old woman until she shrunk away as if she had been only a figure in a dissolving scene. To rest here, however, formed no part of Plantagenet's plan, for he must see Cavendish, and that instantly; he therefore re- traced his steps, and after passing St. Michael's Church, on Meeting Street, turned to the left and passed down a narrow alley, at the end of which he touched a door,' kicked it open, and there discovered the object of his search, Cavendish, stir-   A'ROMANOE.          173 rounded by his hearts of gold, Clarence Cockburn, Abram Spitler, Miles Brewton, Pringle Bull, and Anson Ball. They were practising their infernal frog concert, intending to sere- nade Mr. Thomas Bee that very evening, and were in full chorus when Plantagenet entered the apartment. They all rose as Plantagenet entered, and suddenly stopped the concert; but, as each of the, singers wore on his countenance the pecu- liar feature of the frog he was imitating, it was impossible for Plantagenet to keep his countenance from exhibiting the effect of their buffoonery on him. But, as he was not in a buffoon- ing mood, he soon put a stop to their concert by requesting the company of Cavendish for a moment or two in private. That gentleman, who readily suspected what was the occasion of this visit, immediately accompanied Plantagenet to a small apartment at the extremity of the room. They closed the door after them and locked it. "Cavendisl," said Plantagenet, "it is all just as you told me. It is all true to the very letter, and I have been selected for the sacrifice. Listen; I called this morning on Lexington, and stated what I had heard. He demanded my author's name. I gave it. He then said that my information was true, that Hamilton had determined to challenge me, but that, as I was aware of it, he would advise me to rest on the aetion of Hamilton. But I refused at once, and point blank. I told him that I would not submit to such treatment, that I was the victim of a woman who had sworn to destroy my life, that I was acting purely in self-defence, but that, as I knew the determination of Hamilton, he should soon know my determi- nation also, which was to meet him in his career and demand some explanation of his conduct; for, if he contemplated a challenge, then I should anticipate his action and challenge him, as I am the injured party." The eyes of Cavendish sparkled with pleasure as he heard this statement, for he perceived that Isabella Huntly had not deceived him in the information as to the conversation at Colo-   174        ROSE MLTON: nel Milton's. How she had ascertained the facts of that con- ference he did not inquire, for he well knew that women have secret intelligence of everything that occurs in the world, and he had trusted too implicitly to her guiding genius to discredit her now. In truth, Cavendish was little more than the tool of Miss Huntly; he was not aware of the fact, because he was blinded by the hope of revenging himself on Fanny Walsing- ham; but he was her tool, nevertheless, and she had address enough not only to make him believe that she was aiding him, but of screening herself from the public eye, leaving Cavendish to bear the brunt of its displeasure, in consequence of the slan- ders against Miss Walsingham. But on this point Cavendish did not care a farthing, for he despised the opinion of society; he- had always lived in defiance of its laws, and he actually began to thrive on that defiance, just as Mithridates grew fat from eating poison. When I say that he began to thrive on this defiance, I mean that he lived the hatred down, by his temerity and tenacity of will, by the concentration of his pro- jects, and by the profuse expenditure of money, which he lavished on the companions of his inglorious carousals. The conjunction of these various influences prevented him from sinking to his proper level as a worthless libertine; and, in the opinion of many elderly persons, he was really a very eligible match, a very proper young man, such influence has money over the hearts and heads of the virtuous ton. Worth, valor, wisdom sink into nothing, but the " almighty dollar" rises and swells into a moon, and your real old aristocratic fogy knows no delight equal to that of gazing at the said moon through the magnifying magic of the world's lorgnette. But we must re- turn to Plantagenet and Cavendish. "You now know," said Cavendish, "where to find your footing. What is it that you desire to consult me about?" "Why, this," replied Plantagenet: "I have resolved to challenge Hamilton." "No, I object to that," observed Cavendish; "for as yet                       .   A ROMANCE.          175 you have received, no notification from Hamilton as to his in- tentions with respect to you. He is compelled, as a gentle- man, to introduce the subject of your difference not by a chal- lenge, but by some preliminary step. It is this preliminary step, or negotiation, which affords you the opportunity to place yourself in your true position; and one thing is quite certain to my mind," continued Cavendish, "which is that, if Hamil- ton dpes not challenge you, then you must challenge him." But am I bound to submit to his assuming the initiative?" asked Plantagenet. "You forget," remarked Cavendish, "that, up to this time, or, in fact, up to the time of your hearing from Hamilton, you are to be ignorant of his intentions towards yourself. The knowledge you possess on this subject you obtained through me, and the difference between Hamilton and yourself can have no ostensible existence until you hear from him. The necessity of the ease compels you to take this view of it, how- ever much it might gratify your pride to anticipate Hamilton." "I do not care," replied Plantagenet; " and you must not tell me about necessity. I hate that word, necessity! It is sufficient for me that I know a resolution has been formed to punish me, and that Hamilton is the instrument chosen to in- flict it. He will not stop to inquire how I came by the know- ledge of his intention; he is not a man to mince words when action is requisite, nor shall I wait to receive the blow. If I am to fight, let me advance and fight; I must'go into battle charging sword in hand. This is my determination. You know that, when I have made up my mind, I always act promptly. The next question with me is, Who shall second me? Will you stand by me in this affair? Let me have your answer, yea or nay." "I shall be most happy to see you through," said Caven- dish, using one of his slang figures of speech; " but I cannot think of compromising myself with a certain person, which I   176        ROSE MLTON: would surely do if, with my sanction, you took the initial step in this affair," "Then," said Plantagenet, turning on his heel, and putting his hand on the key, " there is nothing more to be said to you on the subject, and I must apply for assistance elsewhere." "Stop a moment," replied Cavendish, who now became alarmed at the idea of Plantagenet's engaging any other person "to see him through" except himself. 'Stop a moment You surely do not mean to challenge Hamilton without first requiring some explanation, or apology, for conduct that has wounded your honor?" "Certainly, if it is requisite," replied Plantagenet, "but ] see no necessity for it." ' What act has he committed of so grievous a nature," asked Cavendish, "as to require an apology other than the consulta tion at Col. Milton's?" "What act?" exclaimed Plantagenet, as a deadly paleness overcast his face; " but I forget-you are not aware of a cer tain portion of his conduct towards me!" "Nay, but you must tell me everything relating to your difference with Hamilton," said Cavendish; "for if you d( not, how shall I be able to manage your business? But ii occurs to me," continued Cavendish, after a pause, seeing the hesitation of Plantagenet, " it occurs to me that there is some secret difficulty between Hamilton and yourself, which requires explanation. If so, you will see the propriety of informing me of it particularly." What! inform him, when he scarcely dared to breathe it t( himself in the privacy of his chamber? There was death ii the thought, and Plantagenet would have died at the stake sooner than reveal the fact of Hamilton's overture to Miss Walsingham, in his name. His reply was, therefore, decisive and emphatic. "The secret difficulty which exists between Hamilton anc myself," said Plantagenet, "is of a nature too sacred for me t( (   A ROMANCE.           1" mention voluntarily. But it is not requisite that you should know this secret, as Hamilton will readily understand the cause of my displeasure, his own anger against me rising from the very opposite view of the question. This is all that I have to say touching that affair. Now what am I to understand? Will you act for me?" "I have never declined doing so," replied Cavendish; "and although I do not like to work my way in the dark, yet it seems, as Sir Luke says in the Lame Lover, 'that poor Pil Garlick would be discarded,' if he were too particular. I submit." "Then follow me!" said Plantagenet, turning the key and opening the door.. T}iey crossed the apartment in which the comrades of Cavendish were making merry, and, arm in arm, they took their way to Plantagenet's. CHAPTER XXII. WE must now return to Rose. Milton. When Hamilton and Lexington retired from the presence of that lady, she lost no time in hastening to console the afflicted Fanny Walsingham, who was still an invalid, and confined to her chamber. In truth, Fanny was the picture of distress, and she began to ex- hibit in her face traces of that misery which was crushing her guileless heart. She had thought of little else since the pro- mulgation of the base scandal, save its outrageous cruelty and injustice. I say little else, for there 'was one other subject which engaged her attention, and would force itself upon her mind, and that was the continued silence of Mr. Plantagenet. He had not called, nor had he written to her, -since the even- ing of her interview with Hamilton. What could this mean? Could it be possible that he believed the reports against her- 16   178     -   ROSE MLTON: character? No! Then surely he must be ill-he was, per- haps, himself, suffering, and confined to his chamber. She did not doubt the, truth of Plantagenet, and yet, in spite of herself, a suspicious thought would cross her mind-it lingered there a moment only-that the insidious report may have poisoned his heart, and that he had abandoned her to a cruel and most merciless fate. Nor had she heard from. Hamilton, of whom she was thinking when Rose entered her chamber. "You see," said Rose, kissing her friend, "that I am come again, and, like the dove of old, to bring you joy!" "Have you seen Mr. Plantagenet?" asked Fanny, deeply affected by the solicitude of Rose. "Mr. Plantagenet!" said Rose, pausing, and averting her face to hide its expression from Fanny; "no, I have not seen Mr. Plantagenet." "What joy is this, then, that you bring me?" inquired Fanny with deep emotion. ' This question satisfied Rose that, whilst all her thoughts were bent in bringing Plantagenet to justice, for his abandon- ment of Fanny, all of Fanny's thoughts were in favor of Plantagenet, and that she still regarded Cavendish as the per- son who was to be punished for his scandalous reports against her character. Rose could scarcely brook the. thought of im- parting to Fanny the fact touching Plantagenet, as she knew that its effect would be fatal, in the -present condition of her health; nor indeed could she devise any plan by which the truth would break the vision of Fanny on the subject of Plan- tagenet, and she had partly determined to let the truth reveal itself, which it could not be long in doing, as the silence and the absence of Plantagenet would be sufficiently significant of his resolution. I have just had an interview," said Rose, "with one of our friends, who has promised to punish the offender. This is the news, my dear, which I thought would be joyful to you, and which I have hastened to communicate."   A ROMANCE.           179 "I have almost ceased to think of Mr. Cavendish," replied Fanny;  it is the base slander, and its circulation, which have touched my feelings. If the report could be crushed at once, I would care but little for the punishment of Mr. Cavendish. His own thoughts must be punishment enough, if indeed he ever thinks. For myself, I feel that I shall not be long in this vale of tears-the misery of my situation is more than I can bear; for I am overwhelmed with shame and confusion, when I think of the effect this scandal must have on the minds of my relatives and friends. Has Mr. Plantagenet taken any step in .this affair? or is he the friend to whom you refer as having promised to punish Mr. Cavendish? Tell me, Rose?" "My sweet Fanny," said Rose, embracing her friend affec- tionately, "pray, calm your feelings. It is dangerous for you to yield to this excitement. Do not disturb your imagination with fancies about the state of your affairs, for I am exerting  all my influence to justify you-." By thus avoiding any answer to the question put by Fanny, Rose hoped not only to soothe her emotion, but to quiet her suspicion, as to the actual condition of things. But Fanny perceived that there was something mysterious in the reply of Rose; and in truth her manner, which she could not disguise, was calculated to deepen the mystery. From the moment, therefore, that Fanny perceived this mystery, she began to exhibit the painful emotions which were agitating her heart; at length, overwhelmed with the intensity of her feelings, she threw herself into the arms of Rose, and wept as if her very heart would break. She clung to Rose, beseeching her to tell her all, to withhold nothing, to say the worst, and not let her remain in ignorance of her fate. What were the feelings of Rose Milton at that moment?  Was she to tell Fanny that Plantagenet had forsaken her? that he repudiated all ideas of alliance with her? She struggled with the emotions that agi- tated her, as she held her beautiful friend in her arms, and suppressed the tears that trembled in her eyes.   180   -    -' ROSE MLTON: Fanny, dearest Fanny," said Rose, her voice choked with emotion, "listen to me-you must be calm. Why distress yourself in this manner? To know the truth, is to conquer misery; it is only when we are in doubt that we are unfortu- nate. The worst, when known, gives us something real to stand upon. Why, then, do you grieve in this excess of misery? why harrow up'your feelings until your heart"-- here Rose faltered, her own heart was too full of emotion, and she sobbed like a child, in unison with her friend. "Why did you not tell me of this before?" asked Fanny. "Tell you of what?" inquired Rose; "what have I told you?" "That he"- here Fanny hid her face in her hands,'as if fearful that the very light in the room would reproach her for her suspicion of the man she loved. Alas, poor child of love 1 You little knew, as the poet hath well said, that man to man so oft unjust, is ever so to woman! But time, the great teacher, will learn thee wisdom, and a moral, ere thy days are many, or thy heart is cold. "I have told you nothing, my dear," said Rose, " except it be that our friend Mr. Hamilton is exerting himself in your cause." Mr. Hamilton!" cried Fanny in amazement, and half mis- doubting the suspicion which had been ripening into reality, touching the treachery of Plantagenet. "Are you sure that he has determined to vindicate me?" and she began to breathe freer, as she saw the gleam of hope that trembled like a star before her perplexed vision. "Thank God!" she exclaimed fervently, as the high and noble traits of his character pre- sented themselves to her mind. "I am glad that the intelligence of his championship lias given you so much pleasure," said Rose; " and you may rest assured of this, that all his energy of character, and all his fertility, and tact, and talent, will be exerted to vindicate your honor from the foul aspersion of a villain, and his accomplices.   Nor is Mr. Hamilton the only gentleman who has arrayed himself in your behalf; for Mr. Lexington has exerted every nerve to arrest the scandal. With two such champions, you need fear nothing that you do not already know. A storm is brewing, it is true, that will shake Afton to its very centre; but all that storm can accomplish against you, has been effected, and our only resource is to direct its action." "You-have confounded me," replied Fanny; "what direc- tion do you speak of? I thought Mr. Hamilton was exerting himself to arrest this report, not to direct its action?" Here, again, Rose found herself puzzled by the sagacity of Fanny, who, notwithstanding her distress, was keenly alive to every sentiment uttered by her friend; indeed, the misery of Fanny had brightened her mind, instead of enervating its- power. "I must know all," continued Fanny, "for it is impossible that I should remain in ignorance of my actual position. There is something behind the scene that I cannot understand. Why this mystery? Am I then really so weak, that Iou dare not trust me with a truth that involves, not only my honor, but my dearest feelings as a woman? Have I been the victim of a double treachery? and what construction am 1 to place on the absence, the silence of Mr. Plantagenet?" "Is your confidence in Mr. Plantagenet still unimpared?" asked Rose, fixing her full bright eye on Fanny. "O! it is impossible that he should believe this dreadful thing against my honor. No! I do not mistrust him! I would answer for his truth, for his constancy, for his love, with all my heart, with all my soul. Plantagenet! he is the very soul of honor, and my confidence in him is not only unim- paired, but is strengthened in the conviction of his honesty and sincerity. Did he not send Mr. Hamilton to me? Did he not implore me to relax the cold formality of my conduct, and accept the heart he placed in my hands? What am I to think? That he has violated his word, broken his vows, his 16*   182        ROSE MLTON: plighted faith, and joined in the merciless cry against my character, my life, my honor? I cannot believe him false; ii is not in my nature to suspect him, and I will not, I cannot." "I admire your sentiments," replied Rose, "for they spring from a heart warm with love and truth. But," and she paused as if dreading to break the spell that bound Fanny to Planta genet; " but we are all liable to err, and perhaps there is nc error so profound as the error of the heart, when it judges of the motives that govern mankind. You feel as you ought tc do on this occasion, for love never doubts, and when it does, it is no longer love, but passionless despair. Forgive me,.Fanny; if I trespass on your feelings, but you have urged me to be explicit, and you know that I have never deceived you in my life. What motive can I have, but your welfare? It is the interest I take in your pure and lovely nature, that prompts me to aid you with all the zeal- of my heart., But is there nothing in silence? nothing in absence? Why is Mr. Plan tagenet silent? Why is he not the champion of your cause if he still holds you in his heart of hearts? Has he taker any step, has he risen up in the might of his love, and hurled your accuser to the dust? Ask yourself these questions They must be answered, and why not meet the issue at once and promptly? I know how hard it is to doubt the object o; our affections-to make the head think where the heart would act; but the evidence of our senses will, sooner or later, wake up- as from a dream, and then we see the dreadful reality ii all its deformity.* The pain of this communication has cost me the greatest agony, but it is absolutely necessary for youl future happiness, that you see distinctly the true position you occupy in the affections of Mr. Plantagenet." The appearance of Fanny during the remarks of Rose was actually excruciating. At times she seemed lost in abstrac tion, and then, again she would become convulsed, and sob witi heart-rending cries that shook the firmer nerves of Rose witl sympathizing agony. "What had she done to merit this dis   A ROMANCE.           183 grace? What act had she committed?  She was hateful to herself. Her name would become a jest, a theme for scandal. Her honor tarnished, her life lied away, to gratify the malignity of a villain." These remarks were uttered during the reply of Rose; but when the name of Plantagenet was mentioned in terms of censure, she lost all restraint, and, wildly tearing her hair, she flung herself in convulsions on the floor. Rose knelt by the side of her wretched friend, and tried to revive her by chafing her hands and bathing her temples with water. But stark and stiff lay the form of that sweet creature in its dread- ful agony. Not a word escaped her lips, not a sigh announced the torture of that crushed and broken heart, but cold and in- animate it reposed in its silent suffering, the victim of the all- boundless power and dread reality of Love. CHAPTER XXIII. WHEN Hamilton bid adieu to Bose and Lexington, he pro- ceeded to make arrangements for encountering Plantagenet. But the initial step was the selection of a proper person to conduct the negotiation, for he well knew from. his previous experience in matters like this that, if " a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver," a 'friend judiciously chosen is a gem whose-" price is far above rubies." He passed over every man who was advanced in life, from the fact that old men are generally impracticable, their minds, their habits of thought and of association being, for the most part, as stiff as their limbs. At length he settled down upon the brilliant young poet, Henry Godolphin, whose attributes were just of that elevated nature to attract the respect and admiration of a chivalric character like Hamilton. In this he would perhaps excite the malice of the million, who, being practical men,   184        ROSE MLTON: see nothing beyond dimes and dishes, and who so well deserve the contemptuous remark of Edmund Burke, that a straw at the nose of such men is of more importance than a great oak at five hundred yards' distance. Hamilton knew, however, that there was always a power behind the throne greater than the throne, that the reformer moves the multitude, the philo- sopher moves the reformer, and that the poet moves the philo- sopher. Having concluded to select Godolphin, he ordered his car- riage for the purpose of proceeding to the residence of that gentleman, which was situated without the bounds of the city, and some distance beyond the Lines. In passing this' cele- brated barrier, he stopped the carriage and got out for the pur- posd of surveying the scene, and giving a free vent to those reflections which were thronging through his busy brain. On either hand he traced this celebrated work extending from river to river, and which had resisted-until famine touched the city with its gaunt and ghostly fingers-the utmost power of Eng- land in the war for independence. Here he saw the gallant Laurens skirmishing at the head of his light troops, and there was the rattle and the roar of battle, the rocket's red glare, the charge of horse, the stir, the strife, the storm of that stern war, and the red rain which fell in dreadful torrents, that shall sanctify that sanguinary field forever in the memory of man- kind. "This, this!" said he, proudly surveying the mound on which he stood, "this is the noblest monument of my country! Would that it could last forever, and be as a pillar of fire to warm the hearts of freedom's younger sons, and incite them to deeds of daring in defence of wisdom, worth, and vir- tue." Thus recalling the past, and repeopling its scene with living valor, he passed on communing with the dying and the dead. At a short mile beyond the famous old Lines, and within the shine or shade of its renown, stands a neat little cottage, embowered-in trailing vines that still preserved their lively   A ROMANCE.           1O0 green, in spite of chilly blasts and wintry winds. The roses had blown, and bloomed, and scattered their fragrance, and the bushes were losing their leaves and leaving the stems and branches to bronze in the sunshine; but the old oak that stood at the north end of this tiny cottage stands there still, "a monarch of all he surveys," and with rights that none dare dispute, so long as Henry Godolphin is lord of that lovely lawn and landscape. Hamilton paused at) the little wicket gate, deeply impressed by the quiet scene, its seclusion from the toiling world, but its profusion of all that is soft and soothing in the sweet South. He advanced from the wicket to the little porch, and a bee flew by him humming the song of his busy life, and Mira, the poet's dog, gambolled towards him with a cry of welcome, and touched his hand with her tongue in sign of amity and hospitality. The articles being ratified by a playful caress, the parties, Hamilton and Mira, took their way to the porch, mutually pleased with their acquaintance, and Mira evidently hoping, from her laughing eyes and merry bark, to make a friend of the city gentleman, if he was not too proud. Hamilton was about to open the door, when he heard the voice of Godolphin, and, turning, saw that gentleman, who was approaching the cottage from the field, where he had been engaged in trimming a hedge of multiflora roses. "I must admire your choice," said Hamilton, in reply to the cordial greeting of Godolphin, and surveying the sweet scene of seclusion around him; "for, after all the toil and trouble of the great world, we find that the wisest men have ever sought a retreat like this, where they could enjoy the reality of life-its freedom from care." "There is, indeed, a certain dignity in retirement," replied Godolphin, "that commands the homage of our hearts; but such a retirement is only to be properly valued when it con- duces to the happiness of society. The seclusion of man should resemble that of the famous soldier who-said that he was never   186         ROSE MLTON: less alone than when alone, meaning that he was always en gaged in administering to the public good. But, apart fror this, the homage .of the world and the applause of its worthie is the sweetest incense to the good and virtuous, no less thai to the worldly and the ambitious; and I have ever been forci bly struck by that beautiful ode of poor Collins, which contain more of the true poetry of life, the echo of its ever-living voice than you will find from Spenser down to Scott:- "'How sleep the brave who sink to rest By all their country's wishes blest! When spring, with dewy fingers cold, Returns to deck their hallowed mould, She there shall dress a sweeter sod Than fancy's feet have ever trod: By fairy hands their knell is rung, By forms unseen their dirge is sung; There honor comes, a pilgrim gray, To bless the turf that wraps their clay, And freedom shall awhile repair To dwell a weeping hermit there.' And, if we turn from the grave of the soldier to the hall of the statesman, we shall find that the champion of the people'd cause is embalmed forever in the songs of the poet:- "' The applause of listening senates to command, The threats of pain and ruin to despise, To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, And read their history in a nation's eyes.' But you will think," continued Godolphin, smiling, "that I have become a twaddler; so let us change the theme, and, with it, let us take shelter in the cottage." They paused in passing through the sitting-room, as Hamilton seemed inte- rested in one of the pictures which graced the wall. "Oh, that," said Godolphin, in reply to the inquiry of Hamilton, {that is one of my renowned ancestors; and, now that Colonel Richardson has named his racer after me, I shall be compelled to have my own portrait painted."   L M V 1  j L *      -Sv a "You must know," continued Godolphin, with the glee of a school-boy-for he was very fond of Hamilton, and on terms of the most familiar association with him--" you must know that we have the cottage all to ourselves this morning, for my mo. ther and Mary have gone to town on a shopping tour, and, as they will dine with Mrs. Plantagenet and Edith, we shall have ourselves to ourselves; so you need not fear to frighten the old rookery. But come." And Godolphin led the way to his study, which was adjoin- ing the apartment where Hamilton had been examining the face and features of the -renowned Godolphin, who had made a great name somewhere, in some other quarter of the world, perhaps in England, perhaps in Palestine; but authorities are plenty, and old Froissart may be consulted by the curious in ancestral cookery bookery. Pah! I must put a martingale on this pen, for it is beginning to rear, and pitch, and prance, and ere long it will be running such a race over this sheet of paper that Godolphin's namesake, the famous stallion, will have to be saddled and started in pursuit. Away, away, writer and rider, and the d-1 take the hindmost! Clear the track, and let desert mount and charge the universe. The study of Godolphin was a gem in its way; it was divid- ed into two apartments, one containing his library and writing- table, the other a lounge, which he frequently occupied at nights during the summer, but was chiefly used when he en- gaged in reading novels. But it must not be supposed that, because he was a poet, he passed his time and employed his serious moments in reading romances merely. Such was not the fact; and, in truth, his biographical works were the most numerous and the most select that I have ever seen in any private library. Every author of Greece and Rome was repre- sented on those shelves; Aristotle's Polemics having a place, no less than the Iliad of Homer, and the Anabasis of Xeno- phon standing by the side of Virgil, Horace, Cesar, Tacitus, and Tully. His English works are particularly rich, having,   188        ROSE MLTON: besides a complete historical series from the Conqueror down to the conclusion of the mighty wars of Napoleon, splendid editions of Shakspeare, Milton, Spenser, Massinger, Ben Jon- son, Beaumont and Fletcher, Congreve, Dryden, Pope, Ros- common, Rochester, Young, Gray, Cowper, Thomson, Addi. son, and Dr. Johnson, and the longpile of "English undefiled," from Colemah and Goldsmith to Coleridge and Lord Byron. Of the ancients, he preferred Homer, Xenophon, and Tacitus to all other writers; -and of the English celebrities, his favor- ites were Shakspeare, Milton, Pope, Goldsmith, and Byron. Next to Byron, he considered Crabbe and Coleridge as the first of these times in point of power and genius; and this, I be- lieve, was the opinion of Byron himself. "Well," said Godolphin, "how do you like it?" seeing Hamilton closely inspecting the books. "Pretty well for a country cousin, eh?" "A literary bee might live and die in these sweets," replied Hamilton. "But, although I admire your collection, which is of very great value, yet I am astonished that you have so few speeches in your collection." "The truth is," said Godolphin, " that I used to be fond of. reading speeches on account of their spice; but, chancing once to take up Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson, I discovered that all my choice specimens, particularly Pitt's Reply to Walpole, were written by Johnson himself, when acting as reporter for the "Gentleman's Magazine;" and, since then, J have banished speeches from my dominion. My subjects," he continued, laughing, " all know that silence passes for wisdom, and so they are all mum. What do you think of that statuette?" "It is almost too beautiful for a man,' replied Hamilton; "for I would have a man manly." ("And yet Byron," said Godolphin, " is the most manly of all the modern poets; there is no sickly sentimentalism about him. I have heard it reported," continued Godolphin, " that Campbell says 'Byron was a fallen angel, and that he broke  A ROMANCE.           189 his foot in falling.' See the malevolence of that speech! I  have turned Campbell's face to the wall in consequence of that remark." And Godolphin pointed to a picture frame which was turned with its back in front. "That's the way," con- tinued he, " that I punish my subjects when they displease me: if it be a picture, I reverse their position; and if it be a book, I take it down and lay it on- the lowest shelf, from whence it will have to work its way up again by dint of merit. What are you laughing at?" "I was thinking of Cato at Utica and his little senate, as described by Pope in his letter to Arbuthnot," replied Hamil- ton; " and surely you have it all your own way here, as the old Roman did there. But now," continued Hamilton, resolv- ing-to break the business to Godolphin which had caused his visit, "I have some talk for your private ear, if you will gratify me by a little attention."  They took their seats at the small round table which stood in the centre of the study, and Hamilton opened the business with his usual address. He surveyed the entire condition of the parties, the cautious conduct of Miss Walsingham, the fiery impetuosity of Plantagenet, his madness, and the effort of Hamilton to revive the sinking fortunes of his friend by seek- ing an interview with Miss Walsingham, and the result of that interview; and, having finished this portion of his communi- cation, he took up the scandal of Cavendish against Miss Wal- singham, its communication to Plantagenet by Cavendish, and its effect on the hasty and jealous temper of that person. He next described the efforts of Miss Milton, Lexington, and him. self to crush the scandal; the denial of Mr. Middleton, the visit of Rose and Middleton to Isabella Huntly, the conduct of Miss Huntly; the expedition of Lexington to Camper- down, in pursuit of Cavendish, his failing to find him; and finally, of Hamilton's promise to Rose Milton that he would hold Plantagenet accountable for his conduct to Miss Walsing- 17   190        ROSE MLTON: ham. Godolphln listened attentively to this minute relation by Hamilton, and said, in reply-- "I agree with you, Hamilton, that something should be done not only in behalf of Miss Walingham, but on your own account, for it appears that your gallant conduct has met with cavalier treatment; but, as Plantagenet is my relative, I must beg you to relieve me from the unpleasant position of-acting as your second on this occasion. I have, however, a remedy to suggest, which is that we call on Hayne, and consult him as to the stle in which Plantagenet should be approached. I know Hayne intimately, and whatever may be said of his rashness in public affairs, there is nothing better known to me than his admirable prudence and cautious deliberation-in other words, his wisdom in private matters. If you take my advice, then, we will go to town this evening, and have an interview with this gentleman."  There being no objection to this arrangement, particularly as Hamilton recognized the necessity of engaging some other second, in consequence of the relationship existing between Plantagenet and Godolphin, they agreed to proceed imme- diately to Afton, Godolphin taking a seat with Hamilton in that gentleman's carriage. CHAPTER XXIV. WHEN Plantagenet arrived at home, he perceived that Mrs. Godolphin, and her daughter Mary, were on a visit to his mother, and as his business required the utmost secrecy, he in- vited Cavendish to join him in the pretty summer house that stood in his garden. True, it was not summer, but the day was warm, bright and beautiful, the mocking bird was singing in his tiny painted cage; white and black rabbits were sport-   A ROMANCE.          191 ing below, whilst mighty cock pigeons were sporting above on the house tops, and making love to their dulcet dames. What a day to harbor anger against a fellow being, and desire his destruction! Are we truly "dirt and deity?" or are we the wreck and ruin' of lawless, loveless passion? The fire that burned in the breast of Plantagenet was not smothered by the gush of nature on that exquisite morn- ing. He saw not the bright sunshine-he heard not the note of the mocking-bird; nay, he kicked a black rabbit from his path as he walked to the summer house, and drew Cavendish to a seat by his side. "Cavendish," said he, convulsively, "the die is cast, and we must pass the Rubicon. There must be no pause this side of indemnity. Hamilton must fight me! I see the necessity of a combat to rescue me from the torture of my position. He has placed me there, and on his head must be the conse- quences. I am resolved!" With all his hardihood and lack of principle Cavendish was not entirely destitute of remorse, and although he had been industriously engaged in trying to crush the character of Miss Walsingham, yet the destruction of Hamilton was not within the scope of his revenge. He paused, therefore, to consider the remarks of Plantagenet, and to reflect on the consequences of a precipitate action, without previous negotiation. Besides this, he was aware, that, in seeking for redress, the party ag- grieved always demanded an apology, that being deemed suffi- cient atonement, if accorded. He was thinking of this, when Plantagenet exclaimed, still holding him in his nervous grasp: "What are you thinking about?  I say we must act promptly. --There is no medium. Hamilton must be chal- lenged. We'must fight! What do you say?" "Plantagenet," replied Cavendish, "there is always some preliminary negotiation in affairs of this kind. We are en- gaged in a business of life or death-your fight must be for a funeral! Even when two armies are about to engage, the   192        ROSE MLTON: battle is usually preceded by the skirmishing of the light troops. What the light infantry is to armies, negotiation is to individuals. It is better that we open this business according to the established usage." "I will not listen to such talk," said Plantagenet, with deep indignation, "it is too trivial to demand attention for an instant. Preliminary negotiation? That's past! He opened the negotiation, and I shall have nothing to do with it. But why talk to me about negotiation? Has Hamilton sought to approach me by negotiation? Has he not determined to chal- lenge me? You know this, as well as I do, and now, when honor demands action, immediate action, you talk to me about negotiation! Have you never heard that councils of war never fight? My object is to fight! and, therefore, I shall listen to no negotiation-no council. -Will you act for me?" "If I am to act for you," replied Cavendish, "I must claim for myself one of the attributes of my sex-the right to think. I will act blindly for no man. The imprudence-nay, the rashness of your conduct-whl be attributed to me. All the censure will fall on my head; such you know to be the charity of thP4orld, particularly where I am concerned, for 'there is not an action that can peep its head out,' as Falstaff says, 'but I am thrust upon it.' I am not only the terror of all the old women of Afton, but the. old men regard me as a kind of Lord Lyttleton, who used to ridicule women by making a ball of blanc mange, and sticking it over with sugar plums." The sheer fact of Cavendish having, for once in his life, alluded, with something of remorse, to the incredible wildness of his disreputable life, caused Plantagenet to drop his hand from his companion's arm, and gaze at him in mute amaze- ment. He seemed to be wondering what part this Roscius was now about to play, when a servant announced Colonel York. The change that came over Plantagenet on the announcement of this distinguished gentleman, was like magic. He rose, and received his guest with courteous gentleness, introduced   A ROMA-NE.           193 him to Cavendish, and recalling the fist morning of their ac- quaintance, compared it to that which was shedding its luxu- riance on the brow of old winter. The contrast between Plantagenet and Colonel York was great and striking. The first was one of the handsomest men of this age, the last was one of the plainest. The one had the most exquisite address imaginable; the last, seeming to despise address merely as tri- vial, uttered "thoughts that breathe and words that burn," tak- ing your heart as if by instinct, and shadowing forth your own sentiments by the truthfulness of his own noble nature. He was constant, Plantagenet inconstant. The one was impulsive, the other steady. The one flew to his object with the wing of an eagle, the other attained his ends with the precision and the measured tread of a veteran marching into battle, with bayonet fixed and powder dry. They were both gallant, gene- rous, and brave; but one was rash, and as moulds for future monuments, Plantagenet might be shaped to any height of honor, such was his plastic genius; but Colonel York was com- posed of inflexible materials-he was born in the South, lived for the South-and hated everything that injured her pros- perity, or circumscribed her sphere of glory. Plantagenet might have diffused himself more generally over the popular mind of the country at large, but Colonel York would have con- centrated opinion in certain sections, as in a focus, and become the champion of the people's cause, and defender of the people's rights. These were only some of the characteristic traits of York and Plantagenet, there being other features almost as striking, that made them antagonistic in every point of view. For instance, Colonel York was a great advocate of the pen, as an instrument of correcting political abuses, but Plantagenet placed little, if any, reliance whatever on the beneficial effect of political paragraphs, directing his attention more particularly to the address of social intercourse; and such is the magic of mind and manners, that one may almost 17*  He   194        ROSE MLTON: question the empire of the pen-at least in the southern States, where the art of writing is something of a mystery, like masonry-when placed in competition with the pervading power of social intercourse. The presence of Cavendish was qyidently embarrassing to Colonel York, and after the usual preliminary interchange of courtesies, that gentleman expressed a desire to speak a mo- ment with Plantagenet in private. But before the latter could make any reply, Cavendish turned to Colonel York, and said, with a winning smile:- "Do not make a stranger of me, Colonel York, for I am well aware of the motive which has prompted this visit. In- deed, I might afford you some assistance in convincing our friend Plantagenet that he is wrong in wishing to challenge Hamilton-at least at this stage of their difference." If the reader gives Mr. Cavendish credit for his sagacity in discovering the object of Colonel York, the reader will only be rendering justice to the sagacity of Mr. Cavendish. He guessed, and he guessed right. "I was not aware of the motive an hour ago, myself," re- plied Colonel York, smiling at the unblushing effrontery of Mr. Cavendish, " but as you appear to be acquainted with the facts of this case, it may be important to have your advice. Mr. Plantagcnet," continued Colonel York, addressing himself to that gentleman, " pray state to me the facts you possess touch-' ing the difference between Hamilton and yourself. I recognize the delicacy of the question, but my solicitude, and that of your friends generally, has made it our duty to ascertain the facts of this quarrel, and if it be possible, to take some steps for its amicable adjustment, or, failing in this, to place you both in your true position before the country." "I thank you for the interest you manifest in my behalf," replied Plantagenet; "but there has been no quarrel between Hamilton and myself, he has merely compromised me with a lady, that is all. Who has prompted you to seek me on this   A ROMANCE.          195 occasion?"And Plantagenet turned his dark fiery eye on the firm and resolute face of Colonel York. "It was not my intention to offend you," said Colonel York, mildly, "and I think the nature of our previous intercourse should convince you that none but a friend of yours would dare to approach me on such a subject. But'if you will not relate the facts of the case, then let me know what steps you have taken to redress what you seem to think a very great wrong. 'Have you challenged Hamilton?" "I have not yet," replied Plantagenet, "but I shall do so before the sun sets, if I live!" "Have you sent any one of your friends to confer with him?" asked Colonel York. "It is surely due to Mr. Hamil- ton that you treat him with all respect and courtesy. He is your equal in sodiety, and that very society would be the first to censure your conduct, and condemn your precipitancy, should you violate the laws which custom has established for its security. Will you pardon me for saying that you must adopt this course, or cease to think of redress?" I acknowledge no power to control my motions," replied Plantagenet, "and particularly at this time, and on this occa- sion, for Hamilton has determined t challenge me." "How know you this?" asked Colonel York; " and if you know this to be true, why do you seek to anticipate events? From all that I can learn, Hamilton regards himself as the in- jured party, and if such is indeed your relative positions, then it is your duty-it is incumbent on you, by every tie, as a man of honor-to receive his advance, which will afford you ample scope to vindicate yourself, and retort upon him, if his charge be false or frivolous. This is your true position, turn it and twist it as you may, and this position you must assume, if you desire to maintain the good opinion of your friends and the community. Why adopt a course so unusual? A challenge is the last resource, not the first step, in matters of this kind. If you will take the advice which I now give you, fully and   196        ROSE MLTON: freely, in the sincerity of my heart, I will pledge myself to exert every faculty of my nature to adjust this difficulty with all honor to you both; and surely you should rejoice at the opportunity which is presented of adjusting your difference with a man like Hamilton, and of crushing the reports that tend to injure the honor of a virtuous lady." "Let Hamilton stop those reports," replied Plantagenet, "as they originated with him. But what a thing you seek to make of me. le first compromises me with a lady, and then I am to receive his challenge, because I do not choose to ratify his overtures in my behalf! Am I a man? or am I an auto- maton, for some Maelzel to move at pleasure? I might, in- deed, have yielded to your request for an adjustment, if the fact had not come to my knowledge that Hamilton had deter- mined to challenge me-"  "Pardon me for interrupting you," said Colonel York, "but if I can obtain the explicit avowal of Hamilton that he does not intend to challenge you, will you suspend your deter- mination for the present?" "I do not see," observed Cavendish, "how that will better the position of the parties." "And neither do I," rejparked Plantagenet. "The fact is, Colonel York, that you and Lexington have determined to form a court of honor, which is to superintend my conduct. Have you seen Hamilton?" "No," replied Colonel York, "I have not, and simply be- cause I knew you were composed of the more inflammable materials. It was the part of prudence, therefore, to see you at once, and obtain your consent to a suspension of your de- sign, that your mutual friends might explain away your dif- ferences, and restore you to society. Now, if you will agree to stop all proceedings for the present, I will pledge myself for Hamilton." But the thought of waiting to receive the challenge of Ha- milton, was too humiliating for that proud and fearless spirit,   A ROMANCE.           197 and he rejected the manly overture of Colonel York with dis- dain. Apart from this, Plantagenet had noted the expression of Cavendish during the remarks of Colonel York, and, strange to say, the expression was one of fixed hostility. If this be surprising to one who recollects the effort of Cavendish to re- strain the violence of Plantagenet, it is only necessary to state that so long as the discussion was confined to Plantagenet and himself, Cavendish was quite ready to restrain the impetuosity of Plantagenet, but when he discovered the interference of a third party, he became jealous that any one should influence the conduct of Plantagenet save himself, and he resolved to counteract the influence of Colonel York by sustaining the sentiments of Plantagenet. When, therefore, Colonel York spoke of the mutual friends who were to explain away the differences between the parties, Cavendish smiled with that in- tense bitterness which revealed the workings of his mind to Plantagenet, who turned from Colonel York to Cavendish, stating "that if Cavendish gave the same advice, he would yield his own opinion, and submit." I regard the whole question as being changed by the re- marks of Colonel York," said Cavendish, in his blandest man- ner; "for now it seems that a party of friends has taken up the question, and to that I would never submit. No party of gentlemen, under the name of mutual friends, has a right to dictate to a gentleman touching his character, for it becomes a court of honor; and what does a court of honor know about honor? They resemble our secretary at war, who does not know a musket from a broadsword, and yet, he is a secretary at war! and governs soldiers. The same reasoning applies here. Every man is the best judge of his own honor, his own cha- racter, and his own reputation. I then advise you to reject the advice of Colonel York." "It is with deep concern that I take my leave," remarked Colonel York rising, and addressing Plantagenet; for I can see no real impediment in the way that prevents a conplete   198        ROSE MLTON: adjustment of this unfortunate dispute. It is true that I may not know all the causes that have led to it-for the shoe may pinch where we least suspect-still, in any event it would be better for Hamilton and yourself to be friends, particularly as there is a young lady whose name is connected with your quarrel. Should you fight-should either fall-she will be destroyed-and her destruction will bring down a father, a mother, to the grave." In the profound pain of his heart, Colonel York touched the hand of Plantagenet, and retired. CHAPTER XXV. THE shade of evening was falling on Afton, as the carriage of Hamilton rolled .down Meeting Street, and stopped at Hayne's. That gentleman was busily engaged on some poli- tical plan, but, with his usual courtesy, he received his visitors with cordial politeness, and Hamilton lost no time in intro- ducing the subject of his difference with Plantagenet. "My friendship for him has been so warm, and my associa- tion with him so intimate," said Hamilton, "that I am puz- zled how to act. If he was at heart my enemy, the case would be plain enough, but I cannot convince myself that he cherishes any feeling of deadly hostility towards me; and yet some step must be taken, some remedy applied for the wound which he had inflicted. It was this feeling which prompted me to call on Godolphin, but hg states that he is a relative of Plantagenet, and unable to take any prominent part as my friend. We, therefore, deemed it advisable to see you, and ask your opinion on the subject. I do not desire to involve you. in my quarrel, but simply request that you will indicate the course you think best, under all the circumstances."   A ROMANCE.           199 "I join with Hamilton in this request," said Godolphin; "because I well know the prudence and the integrity of your character. The case is one that demands the greatest circum- spection; the nature of the difference involving, as it does, the feelings of a lady, the former intimacy of the parties, and their extensive connections in the city, impress me with the convic- tion that, in this case, prudence is the better part of valor." "I see the propriety of something being done immediately," observed Hayne; ifor, excluding Hamilton and Plantagenet entirely, the feelings of a woman are involved; and when that is the case, the gallantry of our nature must seek to exonerate her sufferings, and shield her from the public eye. But the first step in all affairs, is always of the greatest importance; and as it appears that the field of negotiation is yet unoccu- pied, it is to 'that we should direct our attention. Now it occurs to me that, as Hamilton is the aggrieved party, he must take the first step, not Plantagenet. If this position be correct, then my opinion is that a note should be addressed to Plantagenet, couched in kind, but resolute terms, requesting some explanation of conduct, so much at variance with the character which Plantagenet has ever borne in Afton. But should he decline acceding to this request, I will not say de- mand, then I can see no alternative, but the dernier resort, the call for satisfaction." "I am glad to perceive," replied Hamilton, "that you agree with me in the step that should be taken, before proceeding to extremities. You are perfectly aware of the manner in which I became involved in this difficulty,of the feelings that invoked my interposition, and of the delicate dilemma in which I have been placed by Plantagenet. It mortifies me to the very quick, when I think of my having been instrumental in com- promising a lady who is indued with the noblest and purest virtues. But still, something is due to Plantagenet." It is for that very reason," said Hayne, "I advise you to open the proceeding with the utmost caution, so as to avoid.   200         ROSE MLTON: the door being closed to an amicable adjustment of the pend- ing difficulty. At the same time, I would impress on you the necessity of not mentioning the name of Miss Walsingham in your note. The subject is too delicate for the introduction of her name; it would involve other parties, and fresh cause for anger would arise, which might be disastrous in its conse- quences. This you should studiously avoid, for however just one may be in seeking to redress a personal injury, he has no right to involve the whole community in controversy." "I would deplore such a calamity," observed Hamilton, c as the greatest evil that could afflict me, nor shall one tear be shed in Afton from any-lack of prudence on my part. My object is to obtain redress for an injury inflicted on a lady through me; my native pride, my sense of honor, prompt me to defend her character. It is true that I voluntarily placed myself in this position; but who that has the heart, or the head of a man, who that is imbued with a spark of chivalry, can blame me for the part I acted? But, on the other hand, who would censure Plantagenet for refusing to- sanction my overture in his behalf? It will be said, 'You meddled in mat- ters which did not concern you; you pledged the heart of a man who did not authorize you to be his representative; and now, you seek to make him responsible to you for the part which you voluntarily performed.'" "I see," replied Hayne, " that you are not satisfied in your own mind that you would be justifiable in urging this matter; that is, so far as you are, individually concerned. Nor do I think that you would be, ia the first instance, but as a preli- minary measure, you should interrogate Plantagenet, resting your justification on the known circumstances of the case. These circumstances will exonerate you in the opinion of all honorable men; if he seeks to impeach your motives, or im- pugn the character and conduct of the lady-r-your case is only one of the thousands which happen every day, in which the zealous efforts of friendship are counteracted and defeated,   * J& r T. V XV.&  U      V X VL- by the insidious arts and machinations of false friends, and subtle spies. There is certainly a motive somewhere for this unaccountable conduct of Plantagenet, some secret agent, who has impressed him with sentiments that no really honorable man should harbor in his heart. But as he has refused to re- veal the name of that agent, there is no course open to you but the one which I have indicated, and which, if managed judiciously, might eventuate in the adjustment of the difficulty without inducing the disastrous consequences which I have stated. I would also suggest a course that might be attended with the happiest results, in case you wish to leave no doubt as to the justice of your motive; and that is to induce Godol- phin to dispel the cloud which hangs over the mind of Plan. tagenet, for they are relatives, and in all cases of difficulty, the words of a relative are the surest messages to touch the heart." "My objection to interfering in this business," remarked Godolphin, " arises not only from the fact of my relationship to Plantagenet, but because we have not been on the most in. timate terms, since his association with Cavendish, for that is the man who has poisoned my cousin's heart. If Cavendish was absent, I might have some chance of acting on the fiery, impulsive nature of Plantagenet; but so long as Cavendish continues to control the conduct of that gentleman, by pandering to his tastes and habits of extravagance, any influence that I might exert, any arguments thatc: might urge, in seeking to dispel his delusion, would be hopeless, fruitless, valueless. He would not listen to me for a moment, as he knows- that I have censured his conduct, particularly his inconsistent intercourse with women, now making love to one, now flirting with an- other, and involving himself in a series of unaccountable intrigues, that must finally dispel the charm which his beauty and captivating manners throw around his person. It is for these reasons that I see no hope of my interference being bene- ficial: but if any man can bring him to reason, and make him. 18   202         ROSE MLTON: reflect on the consequences of his wild career, that man is Lexington. He has all the requisite qualifications for such a task,. prudence, judgment, sagacity, tact, talent, and real friendship for Plantagenet, which I believe to be cordially reciprocated. I would, therefore, suggest the propriety of engaging the assistance of Lexington." "I am convinced," said Hamilton, "that Lexington has done all in his power to convict Plantagenet of his error, for he feels on this subject almost as much as I do myself. Still it is worthy of reflection, if Lexington be not the proper person to conduct this negotiation, and as I have every reliance on his fidelity, integrity, and zealous desire to pacify this difficulty, it may be well to entrust him with the conduct of that initial step whic you have stated to be so important to success," "The way to win," said Godolphin, quoting from the "Faerie Queen," and addressing Hayne, " is wisely to advise." aI can only repeat what I have already suggested," ob- served Hayne, " that a preliminary negotiation is requisite to smooth the way towards an adjustment; and that should this negotiation fail, then your only alternative is the dernier resort, I would have tendered my own services in my solicitude to compromise, or rather, to adjust this unfortunate affair, but circumstances that will occur to you, such as my holding a public trust, make such a tender of my services one of deli- cacy, if not of absolute impropriety. The only objection I can possibly have' to Lexington,arises from the fact of his inti- macy with Hamilton; for to one'of the jealous nature of Plan. tagenet, this very circumstance might be a bar to negotiation, and Lexington would be estopped/ to use a legal phrase. But if you believe that he has the power of revealing the true character of. Cavendish to the eyes of Plantagenet-from his personal knowledge of that individual-then, indeed, the first step to negotiation will be taken, and the greatest difficulty overcome." It will be seen from the tone of this discussion, that Hamil-   A ROMANCE.           203 ton was perplexed by the difficulty of his position with regard to Rose Milton, on the one hand, and his real friendship for Plantagenet on the other, not to mention his desire to vindi- cate the cause of Miss Walsingham. In fact, he had a "choice of difficulties," ke Wolfe at Quebec; and that choice, as in- dicated by Hayne and Godolphin, pointed to negotiation, under the conduct of Lexington. He knew, indeed, that Lexington had expostulated with Plantagenet, but he believed that when expostulation was changed to negotiation, there might be a corresponding change in the sentiments and conduct of, Planta- genet. But his wish was father to that thought. He was anxious for an honorable adjustment, from the noble integrity of his heart, which abhorred the remotest idea of imbuing his hands in the blood of a fellow creature, although he recognized the necessity of a personal conflict, should negotiation fail, as Hayne had indicated, and which was the law, the custom, the established practice of the community in which he lived. Even had he been opposed, on principle, to the bloody code which sanctions the murder of our neighbor whom we are commanded to love as ourself, he would have been compelled to yield to the force of circumstances, and bury those principles in the secret recesses of his own breast, for public opinion is the deca- logue of Afton. He regretted his rash vow to Rose, and yet, notwithstanding this regret, he could not see what other course was open to him, except, indeed, the door of negotiation. He could not rest where he was, and therefore he determined to submit implicitly to whatever his friends should advise, which is gene- rally the conclusion we all arrive at in such affairs, as it seems to relieve us from every responsibility. If you kill your ad- versary, there is no cause for remorse, because it was done by advice of the best of friends. If you break the legs, or cut the carotid of your enemy-hurrah! the legs were broken, and the carotid cut, by the "one-two-three-fire!" of your field- marshal. Who cares? Indeed! go-gaze on that sod, that   204        ROSE MLTON: mound of earth, by whose green turf there is a voice of wail- "and woman's eye is wet, man's cheek is pale!' But I must not anticipate events. Having finished their conference with Hayne, Hamilton and Godolphin repaired to Lexington's. Here they found Colonel York, who had been describing his interview with Plantagenet. "In what humor did you find him?" asked Hamilton of York. "It is my impression," replied Colonel York, "that Plan- tagenet would have finally yielded, were it not for the influence of his friend, Mr. Cavendish; in fact, he offered to accede to my suggestions, provided they were approved by that person." "All our efforts having been fruitless," observed Lexington, "the question now arises, what is to be done?" "That is the very thing which has caused the visit of Go- dolphin and myself," said Hamilton; "what is to be done? The advice of Hayne is, that we approach Plantagenet by ne- gotiation, employing a discreet and reliable man for that purpose." "This plan appeared to me, also, as being the proper one,' remarked Lexington; "and it was in consequence of the con- elusion I had reached, that I induced Colonel York to visit Plantagenet. He has just been relating to me the various incidents of his interview, and perhaps it would be well for him to communicate these incidents himself." The attention being now directed to Colonel York, that gen- tleman related his interview with Plantagenet, giving a minute description of every circumstance, and stating,'with consider- able emphasis, the extraordinary influence possessed by Caven- dish over the mind of Plantagenet. "I have never known," said he, "a man with so fine a mind, and one apparently so inflexible, more completely the instrument of another. So long as this influence exists, so long as Plantagenet surrenders himself at discretion to that fashionable coxcomb, the creature Cavendish, so long will you be unable to effect your object,   the amicabld adjustment of this unfortunate difficulty. In fact," concluded Colonel York, "I am almost of opinion that Cavendish, and not Plantagenet, should be the responsible party in this affair." "You see, gentlemen," observed Lexington, the complex- ion this business has assumed, and how hopeless it is to expect anything from the justice of Plantagenet?" "We were not aware," remarked Godolphin, " until a mo- ment since, that Colonel York had gone on this mission of mercy; and it was to urge you," addressing himself to Lex- ington, " to exert your friendly influence with Plantagenet that Hamilton and myself have called upon you. Surely, he can- not be lost to all sense of justice; surely, he cannot be dead to all sense of honor. I have, it is true, often warned him of the consequences of his association with Cavendish, who, I am convinced, is playing a double game on this occasion, for I have long observed his designs with regard to that very lady, who has-been compromised by this quarrel;- and r so far agree with Colonel York that, if any just means could be devised of bringing him to justice, I would gladly, nay, cheerfully, select him as the object of our vengeance. But it is not yet too late to hope for the best, and I suggest, with the approbation of Hamilton, that you make one effort more to obtain redress from Plantagenet. It is possible that you may fail; but, on the contrary, if you succeed, you will have entitled yourself to the thanks of all honorable men." But Lexington peremptorily declined the commission, and therefore Hamilton was compelled to fall back upon the plan' of a negotiation suggested by Hayne. He, therefore, prepared a note to Plantagenet, couched in the kindest terms that could be used in such a paper, requesting some explanation of Plan- tagenet's conduct towards Miss Walsingham, for he well knew that Plantagenet was committed irretrievably, as an honorable man, towards that lady, notwithstanding the turn he had given to'the affair by making the overture of Hamilton the most 18*   206        ROSE MLTON: prominent feature in it. 'This note was approves by the com- fpany, Colonel York consenting to be its bearer; but, just as the party was on the point of separating, the ringing of the bell announced a visitor. At another moment, the ringing of a bell would not have, attracted the slightest attention; but there are times, there are conjunctions, when things trivial in themselves swell into magnitude; and the ringing of the bell on this occasion was one of those trivial things, made important at the moment from circumstances. Lexington, Hamilton, Godolphin, and Colonel York, each and all appeared to feel as if a hand, a heavy iron hand, had been suddenly placed on them, and that their movement was arrested. In the midst of this silence, a servant entered and announced Mr. Cavendish. The blood mounted to the cheek of Lex- ington, and his eye actually burned with anger at the an- nouncement. "Return instantly," said he, with angry vehemence-" re- turn instantly, and say that I am not at leisure." The servant hastened away with this order from his master, but soon returned and stated that Mr. Cavendish "knew Mr. Lexington was not at leisure, but that he should not go away without seeing him, if only for a moment." "What am I to do with this miscreant?" asked Lexington, with suppressed rage. "He beards me in my own house, and is doubtless come to explain away his conduct as the adviser of Plantagenet." "It is my impression," remarked Colonel York, " that he has other business in hand, and that it is important we should be present at the interview which he solicits with you alone. He evidently comes from Plantagenet, as he has no association with you; and, as a message from that quarter may have some bearing on the note just composed by Hamilton, I would ad- vise that Mr. Cavendish be invited to come in." And Mr. Cavendish entered accordingly.   A ROMANCE.           207 CHAPTER XXVI. "I BEG that you will excuse my intrusion," said Cavendish to Lexington, and bowing coldly to the other gentlemen, " but my business is urgent, and, as I was informed that the gentle- man to whom I bear a communication was with you, took the liberty of following him here for the purpose of discharging my commission. Mr. Hamilton," continued Cavendish, "can I see you in private for a moment?" "I do not presume to inquire the nature of your business with me," replied Hamilton; "but, whatever it is, I beg that you will state it in the presence of these gentlemen, as I have no secrets from them." "As you seem to be peremptory in this," observed Caven- dish, haughtily, "Hcan have no objection to stating that the communication I hold in my hand is from Mr. Plantagenet." And he presented the letter to Hamilton. The eyes of the company were fixed on the letter, as Hamil- ton received it and broke the seal. The evident surprise with which he perused its contents excited the euriosity of all, but not a word was uttered. "This is a challenge!" said Hamilton, after carefully read- ing the letter a second time. "A challenge from Plantagenet to fight him, or suffer myself to be posted as a coward." "You have stated its contents correctly," observed Caven- dish; "and I must request that you give, at once, a definite and definitive reply to its demand." "Does Plantagenet allege no cause for this rash proceeding?" inquired Colonel York. "He merely says that I have inflicted a deep wound on his honor, which demands immediate redress," replied Hamilton.   208        ROSE' MLTON: "I would not accept it for that very reason," observed Lex- ington, "because it is incumbent on him to particularize the action which has excited his animosity. To accept it, there- fore, under the circumstances, would be permitting Plantagenet to become the master of your conduct, which he can never be, if you repel his presumption at the threshold. Every man has certain rights which he should never suffer to be invaded, and among these rights is that of judging his own motives. If you are clear that your motives have been wrongfully impeached, it then becomes your duty, as a good citizen and a man of honor, to vindicate those motives at any and every hazard. This is the plain dictate of common sense and common pru- dence; and I repeat my opinion, that you should reject that letter." The advice of Lexington was dictated by a sincere desire to adjust the difficulty between Hamilton and Plantagenet with- out a resort to arms, believing, as he did, that Plantagenet had been precipitattd into this extraordinary demand by those false friends by whom he was generally surrounded. He hoped, too, that further time would be gained for the interposition of mutual friends, who would exert their zealous efforts to suffo- cate the fire of resentment that was burning in the. hearts of the antagonists. "In case that letter be rejecte'," observed Cavendish, "the alternative is evident." This remark of Cavendish stung Hamilton to the quick, and he rose from his seat for the purpose of prostrating the offender, but Godolphin restrained him, and finally succeeded in inducing him to resume his seat. The action of Hamilton had, however, not the slightest effect on Cavendish, whose reckless character was never fully displayed except in the greatest dangers, and sur- rounded as he was by persons whom he knew detested him as a pestilent fellow, he maintained a demeanor so cold, and ap- parently careless of any sentiments concerning himself, that a   A ROMANCE.           209 casual observer might have mistaken him for the moderator, instead of the originator, of the excitement. "I do not think it is by any means material," said Colonel York, " that Plantagenet assign any cause for this challenge. He might, it is true, in consideration of the relations that have existed between Haiilton 'and himself, have requested some explanation before taking the final step, which precludes all negotiation; but, as he has not done this, there can be no objection to receiving his letter, as he was free to assign or not assign any reason whatever. We all know that there is a grave difficulty between the parties, and, as we are well aware of its cause, I can see no reason why this letter should be re- jected because it assigns none, referring merely to the wound on his honor which he conceives to have been inflicted, and  which requires redress by an appeal to arms."  "' It has ever been the custom, in cases of this nature," re- marked Godolphin, "that a call for explanation precedes a demand for redress. This, I believe, has been customary. Why, then, should Plantagenet be permitted to violate a rule so well established and so generally recognized? I might cite the instance of Moore and Jeffrey, in which Moore studiously denied Jeffrey the privilege of explanation; but the conduct of Moore was an exception to the rule, and the ridicule which was thrown on the meeting at Chalk Farm seems but just retribu- tion for his reckless precipitancy. The conduct of Moore on that occasion is similar to that of Plantagenet on this, because there is no door left open by which Hamilton might enter and explain, if he desires to do so, and surely, the difference be- tween these gentlemen cannot be so inveterate as to smother up the better feelings of our nature, the warm impulses that bind all men in bonds of brotherhood." "But still," observed Colonel York, I am not aware that Hamilton desires to make any explanation; in fact, if my knowledge of the circumstances be correct, it is his opinion that some explanation is due to him from Plantagenet, and not   210         ROSE MLTON: the reverse, as Godolphin imagines. Now, it is the opinion-of many persons well versed in theser affairs, that explanations are really apologies, and hence it is that a call f6r explanation is generally met by a refusal from the defendant; and hence, too, the belief that these calls are generally deemed superflu- ous."  "I cannot agree with you that a call for explanation is superfluous," remarked Lexington, who was very apprehensive. that the observations of Colonel York would determine the course of Hamilton. ("It has never been so considered; and, in fact, its disposition justifies the future proceedings. But I shall leave this view out of the question, and, taking your own argument, what is the result? If you state Hamilton's opinion - correctly, that he believes some explanation is due to him from Plantagenet, and not the reverse, then he must maintain his opinion, which is founded on the facts-of the case within his knowledge. Why should he give up his opinion, resign his posi- tion, and assume, or rather be forced to take another view, to gratify the passion of Plantagenet?" "The facts of the case, as I understand them," replied Colo- nel York, "leave the parties an equal right to judge, and the opinion of Hamilton is met by one directly the reverse on the part of Plantagenet, of which that challenge is sufficient evi- dence. I can see, therefore, no good, substantial reason why, if these facts be admitted, the invitation to the field should be rejected. If such a decision should finally prevail, the refusal to receive, or the rejection itself, will be regarded as a subter- fuge." "Subterfuge!" exclaimed Godolphin, vehemently, and in a voice of deep indignation. "Do you characterize the self- respect which is a part of every honorable man, the determina- tion to vindicate the purity of his motives, by a term so de- grading to his feelings?" "But why vindicate his motives?" asked Colonel York. "And what is the object to be gained by doing so? Hamilton *      .,'   A ROMANCE.           2" stands justified in the opinion of his friends-all who are acquainted with the cause of quarrel vindicate and justify the purity of his intentions; and, indeed, he has vindicated his motives so plainly and so triumphantly in his interviews with Plantagenet, that to reject this communication under the plea of its not affording room for explanation, or because it is the custom to leave a door open for negotiation, might pass as good logic in a court room, but not as the chivalric sentiment of a gentleman in a court of honor." "I should like to know," said Godolphin, with a face the color of scarlet, i if you intend to give'that remark a personal direction?" "I give it for what it is worth," replied Colonel York, "and it. may take any direction it pleases." This was sharp shooting, and might have led to sharp hit- ting, had not Hamilton interfered to pacify the disputants, which he effected by suggesting the tender of mutual apolo- gies. Having accomplished this object, he stated that he had listened attentively to the reasons urged for and against his rejection of the communication from Plantagenet, that he might be wanting in nothing that was due to prudence, truth, and justice, but he felt it was due to his pride, and which feel- ing was sanctioned by his judgment, to accept the challenge of Plantagenet,which he did at once by letter, reserving to him- self the right to designate the time and place of meeting. We think it our duty to state that the part taken by Lex- ington and Godolphin in this debate was prompted by their desire to gain time for further efforts towards an adjustment. They saw the train of disasters which would follow the con- summation of this quarrel by a duel; the estrangement of fami- lies, the disruption of friendships, and the irreparable loss to society and the State at large, should one or both of these dis- tinguished young men fall on the field of honor. The field of honor! When shall the poet's curse against the gladiatorial exhibitions, in which men are butchered like dogs " to make a   212        ROSE MLTON: Roman holiday'"-when shall the poet's curse fall on the heads, the hearts, the hands of those inhuman gladiators who meet in the field of honor to violate that great commandment of the Everlasting, "Thou shalt do no murder?" But, in ex- tenuation of the conduct of Hamilton and York, it should be borne in mind that .the custom of the community in which they lived, and which contained every tie that bound them to life, not only recognized the necessity of adjusting personal difficulties by the pistol, but would have stained with cowardice the offender who should have dared to question the moral or legal right of any man to place his life in jeopardy, on account of some passing remark or fancied insult. When we reflect, therefore, on the perfect frenzy which seizes a brave man at the thought of being stigmatized as a coward, we will perceive that there were few or no offenders, in Afton, who questioned either the necessity of duelling, or, indeed, its beneficial effects on the honorable sentiments of the rising generation. In urg- ing, therefore, the rejection of Plantagenet's challenge, they must not be understood as resting their objection on the ground of the sinfulness or the immorality of duelling. No; they would have taken the very course chosen by Hamilton had they been in his place; but their duty as friends prompted them to urge and advise a rejection of the challenge, hoping that ulti- mately the result would be beneficial, for they did not dream that Plantagenet would dare to post Hamilton. Indeed, in that event, they would have made a public vindication of Hamilton, and compelled his antagonist to acknowledge the vindictiveness of his proceedings, or submit to banishment from Afton forever-a bitter alternative, when the unequalled attractions of that lovely city are considered. In a little time subsequent to the retirement of Cavendish with the letter of Hamilton, that gentleman expressed his in- tention of returning home; and invited Colonel York to accom- pany him. This invitation indicated his choice of a second, and, as matters now stood, Lexington and Godolphin being left   A ROMANCE.          213 alone, conferred with each other as to the part they should perform in the sad conjuncture. They saw the absolute neces- sity of the proceedings being guarded from the public eye by the shield of secrecy, for shbuld the fact once transpire that Hamilton and Plantagenet were engaged to fight a duel, the whole town would be instantly in a mighty uproar, and all the men and boys fighting imaginary duels, day and night. They knew the prudent conduct of Hamilton, but doubted that Plantagenet would place any restraint upon himself, re- gardless as he generally was of public opinion, or the public eye. Holding themselves free, then, to advise with Plantage- net, as they had done with Hamilton, they determined to ob- tain an interview with him, and, as no time was to be lost, they repaired immediately to that gentleman's house, and were ushered into the drawing room, where they found Mrs. Plan- tagenet and Edith, and Mrs. Godolphin and Mary, the poet's beautiful sister. Godolphin would have given worlds to avoid this meeting, and the consternation depicted on his face when he unexpectedly encountered the ladies-for Lexington and himself had inquired for Plantagenet merely-induced his sister to ask him if he had heard the dreadful news. Godol- phin now felt that all was over. His doom was fixed, and he was preparing to die with decency, when Mary said:- "Aunty is going to have a party this evening on our ac- count." He revived. He breathed. He lived. He rose from the chair into which he had dropped, kissed Mary, winked at Edith, and went on in a way that-induced his mother to be- lieve that the young poet, her son, was already developing one of the most shining attributes of the poetical temperament-a love for -"the pouting vine, Which is ready to burst into tears of wine!" according to the song of old Anacreon; and, leaving Lexington to entertain the ladies, he left the room in search of Plantagenet. 19   214        ROSE MLTON: He found that gentleman in the withdrawing-room, where he was standing in deep meditation, with the letter of Hamil- ton open in his hand, nor did he recognize the presence of Godolphin until his cousin tapped him on the shoulder. "It is fixed!" he said, recurring to the sentiments of the communication, "and we are to fight-for life or death!' "For death; perhaps-not life, for you have that already," replied Godolphin. "But now that this sad business has ad- vanced to its present position, I have come to request that you keep it a perfect secret, even from your mother and sister; and as I have just been told by Mary that there will be a party here this evening, in honor of my mother, I request that you will give me the liberty of inviting a few of my friends, in honor of the occasion." To this request Plantagenet very readily assented, in fact, he was almost as quiescent and yielding as a child, the reply of Hamilton having deeply affected him. As no time*was to be lost, for the persons invited must have been even then as- sembling, Godolphin called out Lexington from the drawing- room, and hastened with him to his hotel, for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements for the evening. CHAPTER XXVII. GODOLPHN was well aware that the company at Plantage- net's would be select and fashionable, but his design was to procure the presence of persons who, from their intimacy with Hamilton, would lull any suspicion of the fatal quarrel between that gentleman and Plantagenet. He knew that Mrs. Plan- tagenet and Edith suspected the existence of some angry son- troversy-the excitement and agitation of Plantagenet left them little to doubt on that point-and he determined to use every effort of his fertile genius to calm their fears, and restore   their peace of mind. Late as the hour was, therefore, he called on Hayne, Legrange, Lansdowne, Shrewsbury, and Colonel York, inviting them in the name of Plantagenet, and urging them to waive ceremony, and comply with the invitation, as a personal favor to himself. As most of these gentlemen sur- mised the object of Godolphin, they readily assented to his earnest solicitation. Having completed this important ar- rangement, he joined Lexington, and proceeded with him to Plantagenet's. The large hall of that noble old mansion was already full with the youth, the beauty, and the fashion of Afton. Look where one would, there was to be seen some representative of the old r6gime, the Pinckneys, the Gadsdens, the Draytons, the Rutledges, the Bethunes, the Beaufains, the Bentlys, the Bulls, the Bees, the Balls, the Motts, the Moores, the Mani- gaults, the Elliotts, the Izards, the Ancrams, the Hazells, the Rhetts, the Tradds, and Trotts. And there was music, too, and dancing, laughing, jesting, flirting, fanning, and many things that are better imagined than described, such, for instance, as saying soft things to soft hearts, and getting softer things, from softer 'hands, in reply. The softest, the sweetest thing I heard that evening, was from the rosy lips of Catha- rine Grimball*-one would have supposed that she was an angel of mildness, meekness, and milkiness-but, to my cer- tain knowledge, she did that very night, after returning home, give her maid such a dressing with one of her little spangled slippers, for being drowsy at such a fashionable hour, that both * She was the granddaughter of Percy Grimball, captain of the ship-of-war Alexander, and of whom the following anecdote is re- lated: Meeting with his chaplain, when in a certain port, he commu- nicated his desire that divine service should be performed the next Sabbath on board. The chaplain said that he should be glad to re- ceive orders more frequently to that effect. "Oh!" replied Captain Grimball, "I think it well enough to conform to the custom, so long as Christianity is on foot."   216        ROSE MLTON: shoe and spangles were knocked into flinders, and the maid into the middle of next week. Oh, womankind! but they will do these things-they will try to wear the breeches, and failing in that, they substitute the wearer himself, and what becomes of him after the wear and tear of matrimony, may be indicated by his bald head and watery eyes. Poor fellow! there he goes, drooping like a Shanghai after a shower, with fallen crest, and tail dwindled to a single feather, that trails the ground, making a mock of misery! But to return, and to resume, and if I cannot illume the minds of those whose dulness is proof against the moon: of mirth, I shall try and make some of my favorite stars shine out, or the poetry of prose will have got into the region of-chaos, where Anarch, on the sable throne of night- -" lets the curtain fall, And universal darkness buries all." The ladies were all distingyu, and I shall astonish many persons when I declare that the most distinguished women in the room, for their graceful manners, and the high breeding that birth alone confers-for it is not attainable by art-were the old ladies, Mrs. Plantagenet and Mrs. Godolphin. They stood near each other, at the upper end of the room, attended by Edith and Mary, presenting a spectacle that was no less curious than captivating. The perfectly easy and simple man- ners of Mrs. Plantagenet, found a corresponding expression in the matronly bearing of Mrs. Godolphin. There was no pre- tension-no ostensible parade of pride and power--but all was simple and sincere, and these undoubtedly constitute the charm of manners in the refined circles of southern society. It is the want of this simplicity in the manners of the young, and a certain degree of obtrusive pride, which marks the contrast between the southern belle and the southern matron. One could not look at the noble forms and features, the simplicity and sincerity of the mothers, without perceiving the marked to      - *              .   A ROMANCE.           217 and marvellous contrast to all this, in the proud bearing of their beautiful daughters; for, notwithstanding the artless manners of Edith Plantagenet, and the witty conversation and flashing eyes of Mary Godolphin, they preserved a certain air of haughtiness, that excluded "the sunshine of the breast," and impressed one with the painful consciousness that he was rendering homage merely, when tendering the usual saluta- tions. But perhaps this cautious, or proud reserve, may be one of the best safeguards of society-a necessary defensive pride-to preserve the softer part of creation from the rugged nature of man, who, in. any state of society, even the most accomplished and refined, is a tyrant. Men are but brutes, at best, and where they have full swing, they are very apt to play the king of hearts, by taking the lion's share. What, indeed, is it, after all, but a love chase? What is the moral? The lion and other beasts, according to JEsop, formed an alliance to go out hunting. When they had taken a fat stag, the lion proposed himself as commissioner, and dividing it into three parts, thus proceeded: "The first," said he, "I shall take officially, as king; the-second I shall take for my own personal share in the chase; and as for the third part- let him take it who dares!" But there were other stars that shone on that memorable night,. bright, beautiful, and pure as the vestal fire that warmed their young and generous hearts. Of these, I remember Char- lotte Surry, Anastasia Cowper, a descendant of Spencer Cow- per, the brother of Lord Chancellor. Cowper, of England; Ce- lestine Queensbury; Elizabeth York, sister of Colonel York; Virginia Granville; Goriana Garth, a descendant of Pope's friend, Sir Samuel Garth; and Ellen and Francis Reynolds, the last named after the accomplished sister of Sir Joshua. These were the stars of the room, and they were attended by a train of satellites that revolved around them, shining and twinkling, and tripping it on " the light fantastic toe." There was John Montague, and Roger Beaufort, and Thomas Berke- 19*   218        ROSE MLTON: ley, and Ralph Neville, a lineal descendant of old Warwick, the king maker; and Robert Dudley, and William Grandison, not to mention those erratic comets, Pringle Bull, Cannon Ball, Bull Middleton, Horry Bee, and Izard Izard, the owner of Young Rapid, the famous racer. Lexington and Godolphin, after paying their dutiful respects to the presiding deity, Mrs. Plantagenet, separated, the one to repose in the bright beams of this daughter of York, the other to drink in the flood of light that flashed from the glorious eyes of -Celestine Queensbury. I have already mentioned that this lady had some mysterious influence over the mind and mo- tives of Lexington. It was impossible for him to be in the same room without being charmed by her exquisite presence- that certain undefinable something, which is enchantment, for it attracts, subdues, and overpowers us, without one having the wish, or the will, to resist its magic spell. Having discussed with her all the current news of the day, the balls, the belles, the beaux, the last new song of the great- est song writer this world ever produced-Tom Moore-and of Bulwer, and Dizzy, and Pickwick, and Winkle, he broke away from this fascinating creature, promising to call on her the next day; and retired from the busy, buzzing room, to trace the whereabouts of Plantagenet, for that gentleman had not made his appearance among the beaux and belles of the eve- ning. But he did not go far to find him, for in the withdraw- ing or sitting-room, and seated at a table covered with the creature comforts of this eating and drinking world, was the master of Plantagenet House,. discoursing with Godolphin, Legrange, Wayne, Colonel York, Shrewsbury, Harrington, Percy, Marlborough, Lansdowne, and Wynford Best, the cele- brated humorist. Each of these gentlemen was distinguished for some trait, or quality, which contrasted him with the others. For instance, Marlborough was a gastronomist; Harrington was an ideologist; Shrewsbury was a wit; Percy delighted in railing at women; and Lansdowne in ridiculing authorship as   A ROMANCE.           219 degrading; Hayne was argumentative; Legrange critical; Go- dolphin poetical; and Colonel York a strenuous advocate for the South and southern literature. When I speak of Har- rington as an ideologist, it must not be understood that he was a visionary, for the science really comprehends all the subjects which the French term Morale, as the correlative of Physique -in fact, treatises on logic, government, political economy, and morality, make up the circle of ideological subjects, or of those which are within the scope of the understanding, and not of the senses.* At- the time of my entering, Legrange was speaking of Dr. Johnson's "Lives of the Poets," and, much to my surprise, he again attacked those charming yolumes, as well as the doctor's critical powers generally. "You think Dr. Johnson had not the imagination," replied Godolphin, " to reach the flights of Milton. There we differ. He did not enter into a minute criticism of the ' Paradise Lost, because Addison had already occupied that ground in a series of papers that stand unrivalled as specimens of philological per- spicuity. But Johnson took a common sense view of all. com- positions, even the sublimest poems. He had a plain, concise method of reducing every kind of writing to the rules of com- mon sense, and hence he has been accused of being almost dull. His influence was not so much that of an author, says old Kit North, as of a thinker. He was the most powerful intellect of his time-the judge, the emperor, the giant-acknowledged to be a Saul amongst the people. - Johnson's mind was a furnace; it reduced everything to its elemnts; and we have had no truly great critical intellect since his time. Now as to what has been frequently said about Johnson's underrating Milton, what can be more eulogistic than this: Milton is now considered as an English classic; and the "Paradise Lost" is generally esteemed the noblest and most sublime of modern poems, and equal at * I give the definition of Mr. Jefferson, who was himself an Ideo- logist. See his Correspondence, 4th volume, page 300.    ..   220         ROSE MLTON: least to the best of the ancients-the honor of this country, and the envy and admiration of all others i' It is true that I think his definition of poetry questionable. What is poetry? The proper answer is, that invention is the foundation of po- etry; it is the creative power, giving existence to airy nothing, or revealing by its art the mysteries of nature, just as a light brought into a room discovers its furniture. Poetry, therefore, is not imitation, as Dr. Johnson defines it to be, but invention, unless, indeed, he meant that the invention of the poet was merely imitation of nature. The imagination not only invents, but puts thought in action, and we have a grand drama re- vealed to our sight, instinct with life, and on fire by its own motion, just as we know that the solar system is kept in action by the heat of the sun; and to this imagination is due the re- velation of the secrets of nature, and the physical philosophy which Pope calls the 'innumerable knowledges' in his comment on Allegorical Fables." Shrewsbury here recited the following epigram, praising its as the best he had ever read, and requesting that some one would inform him who the author was, viz:- "They say he has no heart, but I deny it, He has a heart, and gets his speeches by it." "That epigram," observed Harrington, "was written by Rogers on some member of Parliament, who said that Rogers wrote very well for a banker." "Miss Gordon, whom I met at Brussels," said Legrange, "told me that Mrs. Shelley got from the 'Guiccioli,' when she was in England, a memorandum book of Lord Byron, in which he lampoons and ridicules poor Rogers in a frightful manner, and has it published-the wretch! But what a heartless, hypo- critical scoundrel Byron was!1* * In the Noctes Ambrosianse, there is an imaginary conversation be- tween Odoharty and Lord Byron, in which Odoharty says-"By the by, what a right good poem that was of yours on old Barn Rogers ;"   A ROMANCE.           221 "If what Tom Moore says be true," remarked Lexington, "that Rogers declined attending Byron's funeral, then no epi. gram by Byron could have been too severe for such a man; and if the existence of the epigrams are really'true, then it only proves that Byron duly appreciated the character of Rogers."* "But what a man!" exclaimed Godolphin, " vital in every part, death seems to dread the contact; in fact, Old Memo- ry' seems to have frightened the grim monster, as he did the- publisher of his ' Italy.' " "I have heard an anecdote of this poet," said Iayne, "that indicates the uncertainty of human calculations. A young au- thor had prepared, some years ago, an elaborate memoir of Ro- gers, and was only waiting for the poet's death to give it to the public. The old poet is still alive, but the youth, who had pre- pared the life, has been nearly a year in his grave." "The calculation of this youth," observed Lexington .to Ilayne, "has reminded me singularly enough of Goldsmith's nathematical calculation and classification of the poets." "What classification?" inquired Hayne. "Why, of Shakspeare, Milton, Dryden, and Pope." "Well," said Hayne, " and'how does he classify them?" "In Goldsmith's poetical scale," remarked Lexington, "or 'elative ranks held by the greater English poets in the require- nents of genius, judgment, learning, and versification, the point f perfection in each is supposed to be twenty degrees, of which ineteen only have been attained by any English writer. Thus nd to this is attached an explanatory note, as follows: A set of dog- Perel rhymes, in which Rogers was complimented as professing, among ther personal advantages, "' Features that would shame a knocker." The story goes that when Rogers visited Byron, in Italy, the noble ard placed the satire, as aforesaid, under the sofa-cushion on which he banker bard reposed, and chuckled at the idea of his sitting, as it rere, on a sort of literary Volcano!-Noctes Amb. Vol. L p. 201. * Vide Memoirs, &c., of Thomas Moore, by Lord John Russell. 'art VI. page 602.   222         ROSE MLTON: Shakspeare is estimated to be in genius, 19; judgment, 14; learning, 14; versification, 19. Milton, in genius, 18; judg- ment, 16; learning, 17; versification, 18. Dryden, in genius, 18; judgment, 16; learning, 17; versification, 18. Pope, in genius, 18; judgment, 18; learning, 15; versification, 18. What do you think of his poetical scale?" "That it is absolutely fanciful and imperfect," replied Hayne; "in truth, all this ordering oft the poets is ridiculous, and so I think Lord Byron has pronounced it to be in his fa- mous letter on the Pope and Bowles controversy." "I have lately heard an anecdote," remarked Colonel York, "that equals if it does not excel Goldsmith's laughable blun- der about Malagrida. The young King of Portugal, on Sir Edward Landseer, the animal painter, being introduced to him, said, 'he was very glad to make his acquaintance, for he was very fond of beasts!'  "Hurrah!" cried Plantagenet, "now let us wine," and so the company wined. "That speech is really the most sarcastic I ever heard," remarked Shrewsbury. "It may be taken either way," said Harrington; but for sarcasm, I think the commentary of Madame de Stael, on the Duke of Wellington, the severest I ever heard. She said that 'Wellington was the greatest man made out of the smallest materials that ever existed.'" "Madame de Stael meant," said Legrange, "that old Water- loo was not romantic, not poetical; in a word, that he was prosaic. Now it may be said, in' his defence, that all happi- ness and order are necessarily prosaic. Aristotle says, your hero must not be a saint. What poet has ever been able to make anything of heaven? What romance writer ventures to go further than the marriage ceremony?" "I have often thought," observed Godolphin, "that from the dread of being deemed prosaic, Byron frequently violated that simple majesty of style which is so requisite in all great   A ROMANCE.           223- imaginative poems. The dread of being tame, or trite, is a great impediment to excellence; and of this blemish no one perhaps was more convinced than Byron himself, who, speak- ing of the simplicity of Napoleon's arrangements at Waterloo, said that simplicity was one of the ingredients of greatness." "Yes," replied Legrange. "One fault, or rather class of faults, which has been justly imputed to Byron's style, is, as often happens, nearly akin to its greatest virtue. Horace shall say what I mean in three words--professus grandia, turget. His genius is, no doubt, incomparably superior to Lucan's, whose gazette ampoulee, as Voltaire calls the Pharsalia, I never yet have been able to read through; but there is the same tone of emphasis and exaggeration in Childe Harold, for example,' as in that poem. The famous sentence, victrix causa PDs placint, sed victa Catoni, which I have always felt to be frigid and extravagant, and now believe so, since I find the Pere Bonhours of the same opinion, is altogether Byronian. There are too much bluster and pretension about this sort of sub- limity for my taste. True grandeur is always simple, and even subdued in its tone, as we see Raphael's pictures, and in the Philippics of Demosthenes.- I was forcibly struck in read- ing the- Prophecy of Dante,' with a certain swelling and swag- gering air about the whole affair, which resembles anything rather than the oracular and terrible brevity of that great poet. Here is a specimen of downright bombast from' Childe Harold- "Above me are the Alps, The palaces of nature, whose vast walls Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps, And throned eternity in icy balls Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls The avalanche-the thunderbolt of snow!'" "But you should remember," replied Godolphin, "that the poet was standing on the Alps! His images rise to this height of their grandeur, because the scenes he is 'describing are   224         ROSE MLTON: grand and glorious, just as in Homer; the reader, to use the language of Pope, is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet's imagination, the course of his verse resembling that of the army he describes-' they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.' What can be more majestic? But if we turn to the 'Prophecy of Dante,' which you have cen- sured so severely, we shall find at the conclusion of the second canto, the profoundest wisdom, 'couched in language deeply, truly, poetical-  "' Oh! my own beauteous land! so long laid low, So long the grave of my own children's hopes, When there is but required a single blow To break the chain, yet-yet the avenger stops, And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee, And join their strength to that which with thee copes; What is there wanting then to set thee free, And show thy beauty in its fullest light? To make the Alps impassable; and we, Her sons, may do this with one deed-Unite!'" "Well," remarked Legrange, "that quotation may pass, although my opinion of the poem itself is still unchanged. But you mentioned invention as the very essence of poetry. Now it does not strike me that Byron was a poet of a very fertile invention. He composed, it is true, with considerable facility, but there is no variety either in his subjects or his style. I doubt, for this reason, whether he could have become distinguished as a dramatic poet, in the modern sense of the term." "There, again, I differ with you," said Godolphin, "for I regard his 'Werner,' as the greatest tragedy of the age, par- ticularly if you weigh it by the modern standard, which re- quires action as its chief feature, its distinguishing character- istic; and I regard that drama as the standard by which Knowles and others, but particularly Knowles, have composed their plays. I know that you will select Manfred,' as the   A  UMANCE. A22. masterpiece of Byron, but I am speaking of a human piece, the acting drama,. and judging Byron bj his 'Werner,' I have little hesitation in placing him at the head of the modern dramatists."* The contest between those gentlemen was kept up for some time with great vivacity, as there was no lack of ammunition; but in its progress, the company became so deeply interested, that, instead of its being a dispute between Legrange and Godolphin merely, the arguments of those gentlemen were completely drowned in the uproar which ensued. But there was one person who abstained from the exciting debate, and that one person was Plantagenet. He sat at the head of his table completely abstracted, with a contracted brow and pen- sive air, as if his better thoughts were in the future; that mighty future, which was soon to raise the curtain, and reveal the wonders and the vanities of life. Vanity of vanities-all is vanity! From the poet who stands at the head of all created beings, a spark from the fire of heaven, and whose spirit awes the nations, down to the toiling clod of the fields, "the hewer of wood, and drawer of water," there is heard one voice of sorrow, one wail of woe. "I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit!" * But one word as to Byron's want of originality. contend that no poet, except Shakspeare, ever exhibited such an endless variety of passions, as Byron has 'done. The gloomy Childe, the revengeful Giaour, the love-sick Selim, the superstitious Manfred,. the tyrannical Gaffir, the lively Count, and the accomplished Juan, are all essentially different; and yet each character presents an image of some distinct passion, as developed by the social and political systems of European and Asian civilization. 20   226        ROSE MLTON: CHAPTER XXVIII. THE reader must have noticed that Cavendish was not at the party. We shall now state the reason of his absence. When he returned home from Plantagenet's, he found the fol- lowing letter on his table from Miss Huntly. AFTON, December, 18-. DEAR MR. CAVENDISH:- I hoped to have seen you ere this, about the important en- terprise that you have undertaken; but supposing that some accident must have occurred to mar the execution of our pro- ject, I request that you will'seize the first leisure moment to call on me, when we can talk the matter over, and ascertain where we are. The great difficulty in projects of this nature, is to understand one's true position; and for this purpose we must imitate the mariner, who ascertains the position of his ship on the ocean, by making an observation with his quad- rant. We must adopt this prudence, for I suspect that the visit of Mrs Godolphin is designed to reconcile Mr. Planta- genet with Mr. Hamilton. Pray let me see you the moment that this comes to your hand, and believe me ever, dear Mr. Cavendish, &c. &c. 'ISABELLA HUNTLY. It was late in the evening when Cavendish read this letter, and he determined to go at once to Miss Huntly, before pro- ceeding to Plantagenet's. 'He made a hasty toilette, therefore, and putting on his hat and cloak, proceeded on foot to call on that arch confederate. In answer to his summons, the servant informed him that Miss Huntly had left home a few moments   A R6MANCE.          227 Previously, and gone on foot, no one knew whither. This in- formation perplexed Cavendish, for where could Miss Huntly have gone at that late hour of the evening, alone and on foot? In this uncertainty as to her proceedings, he determined to join the party at Plantagenet's. But we must leave him on his way, and return to trace the conduct of Miss Huntly. That intriguing woman, after dispatching her letter to Cavendish, remained at home the whole day, expecting his visit, but as the shades of evening fell, and night drew on his mantle, she imitated the old gentleman's example, by drawing over her shoulders a shawl, and on her head a bonnet, with the design of conducting some exploring expedition into the very heart of the city, and of ascertaining with her own individual eyes the political prospects of Afton, at least in the neighbor- hood of Plantagenet House. What her design was, the reader will learn as he travels along the scenes of this veracious history; but that a big idea must have got into Miss Huntly's head, there could be no doubt, for why was she on foot, and rapidly traversing the streets of the city at such an hour? 'It is- the hour when the owl wakes up the feathered tribe with his " too-whit, too-who," and it is the hour sacred to watchmen, and the fashionable "Arabs," who sing the "Blacksmith," and quiz the horse-guards-those ter- rible horse-guards! Miss Huntly cared very little for the latter, notwithstanding the awful jingling of their spurs, but she dreaded the idea of encountering the "Arabs," or their cousins, the members of the frog concert band. But alas! for poor humanity. Just as Miss Huntly turned a cornel, she was startled by hearing the melodious chorus of that band, as it sweetly warbled-not exactly in "Lydian measure"-from some "Serbonian bog," the terrible "tea-tables," and "fry bacons," that make night hideous. She attempted to run the gauntlet, but lo! there stood before her one of the identical frogs, in the shape of Mr. Spitler! She paused, as if doubting to speak, or retrace her steps, and the next moment she was   228        ROSE MLTON: surrounded by the whole band of serenaders, Miles Brewton, Clarence Cockburn, Anson Ball, and Jack Quash, the hopeful brother of Miss Quash, the antique lady who could tell you all about the wars of Governor Grant against the "Injins," and- but I forbear. There is something so sacred about a woman, enveloped as she is in mystery and muslin, that one is apt to- but let us proceed with our friend, Miss Huntly. She is on a hunt, and we must see her "through," for that, we believe, is the slang word now most in fashion with the Arabs. That she could not see her own way through just then, will not be wondered at, when it is mentioned that Cockburn, Brewton, Spitler, Ball, and Quash, formed themselves into a circle round her, and holding hands began to sing "Auld Lang Syne," and when they came to the chorus-- "For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne, We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet, For auld lang syne"- Mr. Spitler attempted to take the cup o' kindness in the shape of a kiss. Was ever maiden so beleaguered? Was ever woman so outraged? Since the time when Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Aguecheek marched arm in arm against Mistress Mary, and sung about "the man in Babylon," never was woman so confronted or confounded. She turned from one to the other, from Spitler to Cockburn, then to Ball, and lastly, she recognized Mr. Quash, by the peculiar roundness of his head, which resembled a popular domestic vegetable, that shall be nameless on this occasion, for a variety of reasons. "Mr. Quash!" said Miss Huntly, with the concentrated energy of a steam-engine, will you hear me?" "Oh!" cried Mr. Quash, "and here's a hand my trusty fre'd, and gie's a hand o' thine," but he received a slap in the face as he attempted to take the hand of Miss Huntly. This act causing a pause, she said- "It is really shameful that a lady cannot walk the streets at   A ROMANCE.          229 midnight, without being insulted," and here she was beginning to show that mighty weapon of her sex-a tear-when the roub's were joined by another, who, hearing the voice of Miss Huntly, came hastily to her relief. This person was no other than Mr. Cavendish. He had been in search of her ever since hearing that she had left home-suspecting her motive for going abroad at that unseasonable hour; and, rightly conjec- turing the route she would take, had pursued, and now found her beleaguered by his confederates and friends. Without uttering a syllable, he threw Spitler and Quash aside, and tak- ing the arm of Miss Huntly in his own, walked rapidly from the group. "Have you received my letter?" asked Miss Huntly, for the first time breaking silence, as they entered her superb drawing-room. "I have," replied Cavendish, " and lost no time in calling here; but your impatience to know the state of affairs between Plantagenet and Hamilton caused you to leave home, and ex- pose yourself to the insults of these incorrigible profligates." "Do you know"-here she paused, for she was about to in- quire if Cavendish was acquainted with them; but, uncertain how he might take the question, and being, in fact, assured of his association with them in some sort, from his ascendency over them in rescuing her without the slightest remark or re- sistance on their part, she changed the question into one touching the effect of his influence with Plantagenet in the matter of the challenge. "I have accomplished every point," replied Cavendish, "and the challenge is accepted." But who was the challenging party?" asked Miss Huntly. "Did Mr. Plantagenet take the initial step? If he did, it will be supposed that he is truly the aggrieved party; but, in any case, I am glad to hear that the circle is contractiig, that the difference between them has been narrowed down to a single point, and that point to be settled only in the field. The life 20*   230         ROSE!1ILTON: of Mr. Plantagenet is hateful to me! There is no fear of his retracting, I hope?" "Retract!" exclaimed Cavendish, who, with all his heart- lessness, was not quite so vindictive in his passions as the fair representative of the soft sex; nor did he desire the slightest injury to Plantagenet, his animosity being against Miss Wal- singham, whose present condition and alarming illness was nectar to his coarse, revengeful,' and brutal nature. Having accomplished his mission, or rather mission with which he was commissioned-for he was acting now entirely by the advice and under the auspices of Miss Huntly-he considered his task as ended, and had resolved to let the further prosecution of the quarrel depend upon the passions of the belligerents, reserving hinself merely as the second in the business. If all seconds were to occupy this position, instead of arrogating to them- selves the position of principals, I am confident that there would be few duels adjusted on the field of honor. It is the seconds, the vain, proud, pompous fools, who are for dipping their arms to the elbows in blood; sooner than recognize the necessity of the smallest concession or compromise, as if man in society is not the result of a compromise. But, in resolving to confine himself to his position as second, Cavendish did not design to conciliate the parties, his resolu- tion being simply indifference as to the result; Now, it so happens in this world we live in, that there is always some one who goads or guides us, and, in the case before us, Isabella Huntly was both the one and the other to William Cavendish, for she had guided him in all that he had previously done towards Miss Walsingham and Plantagenet, and now she determined to goad him into precipitating the awful catastrophe. "He cannot well retract," continued Cavendish; "but I see no necessity for being too hasty in this affair." "Have you calculated the chances of postponement?" asked Miss Huntly. ' "The delay of one day may defeat our project, for have you not heard that Miss Walsingham is dying?"   A ROMANCE.           231 "Dying!" cried Cavendish, springing to his feet, as a deep blush tinged his cheek with the consciousness that her death would be due to his scandalous defamation of her character. "Good God! in what a fearful position I stand! It seems to me as if I am covered with blood!"And, shuddering with emotion, he looked at his hands, as if he really expected to find them red with wrath and ruin. "Maintain your position firmly," remarked Miss Huntly, "and remember the success of the Roman augur: he cut boldly, and you should act with the same audacity, if you de- sire to succeed in life. This is the, great secret of success in all undertakings; it is the inspiration that wins battles, and incites to all great attempts at the bar, in the senate, and the field, and without which man is at best but a kind of human coward." This last word stung Cavendish as if it had been an adder, and Miss Huntly knew that, by employing it, she could have used no more effective weapon in touching the false pride of Cavendish. He turned and looked in the face of his fair friend, but it wore a smile so sarcastic, and an eye so scathing, that he turned away to seek relief from some more soothing object. Having reflected for a long time on the aspect of things, he said- "I do not comprehend you. What is it that you propose?" "I have nothing to propose," replied Isabella, artfully; "it is you who occupy the position for observation, as you are in daily communication with Mr. Plantagenet but, from what you have said, I should think that the sooner you hasten for- ward this business to its catastrophe, the better.' You have heard it said that delays are dangerous, and is there no danger here, particularly when you know that Miss Walsingham is at the point of death? If she die before this affair is brought to a conflict in- the field, it will never take place; for delicacy itself, apart from all other considerations, would make the   232        ROSE MLTON: parties adjust their quarrel, and perhaps mourn as brothers in the dust that decked her grave." "It is not in the power of Mr. Plantagenet to designate an early day," replied Cavendish; "but I can sound the second of Mr. Hamilton on the subject, and, if possible, bring this business to a speedy termination." He now rose, took the hand of Miss Huntly in his own, kissed it, bowed, and retired. He had no sooner left the room than Miss Huntly rose, turned to a portrait of herself which hung against the wall, and, after surveying its features for a moment, uttered a gentle laugh, so sweet and soft, that one would have imagined that she was thinking of something delightful and delicious. Per- haps she was. But taste is different in different individuals. Some there are whose voice is but the echo of the heart, whose joyous laugh rings out from a heart gushing with generosity; and there are others in which all this is reversed, in which a smiling lip, a soft, sweet voice, and merry laugh do not indi- cate a heart full of love and the luxury of doing good. Was Miss Huntly's heart gushing with generosity, or was it devoid of that charitable attribute, the luxury of doing good? CHAPTER XXIX. THE remark of Miss Huntly to Cavendish, that Miss Wal- singham was dying, demands some inquiry into the condition of that young lady. It will be remembered that we left her in a state of utter insensibility, prostrated by the dreadful intelligence which had been communicated to her by Miss Milton. In this state she remained until long after midnight, her friend kneel- ing by her side and striving by every effort to restore her to consciousness; but, finding her exertions of little or no avail, Rose, with the assistance of a female servant, removed Fanny   A ROMANCE.           233 to her couch. It now became necessary to communicate her condition to her father and mother, -and, accordingly, Rose dispatched the servant to apprise them of their daughter's sud- den prostration and alarming illness. Her own opinion was that Fanny's sudden indisposition would terminate in madness, unless some powerful remedy was immediately administered. But what remedy? She had already applied every restorative known to young ladies, such as red lavender and volatile salts, -but they had no effect whatever on the insensible and appa- rently inanimate patient. It never once occurred to her that la doctor of medicine should be called in; for, strange to say, Rose had no faith whatever in the faculty, or its ability to re- lieve a case like this. I say strange, because most young ladies believe that a man of medicine is a kind of panacea that cures all diseases and afflictions incident to humanity. When Mrs. Walsingham entered the chamber and saw the condition of her daughter, she attempted to approach the bed, but her limbs refusing to obey her wishes, she placed her hand on the head of Rose and gazed into her eyes for some explana- tion of the dreadful attack. There was something so awful, and yet so palpable, in the gaze, that Rose felt as if she heard a voice asking, "What hath caused this calamity?" and, over- powered by the emotions of her own trembling heart, she covered her face with her hands and burst into tears. The next moment, Mrs. Walsingham   had mustered sufficient strength to reach the bed. She put out her hand and placed it on Fanny's forehead, but it was so cold and clammy that she shuddered as she spoke, in a low, breathless voice, "My daughter 7" But there was no reply. The beautiful girl lay as if unconscious of existence, or, if she did exist, her thoughts were far, far away in the dream-land, where Death is chasing sinners with his fatal dart in the eternal shades. Alas, poor child! to have such life, such love, and now to be thus, the wreck of passion and the ruin of its power. Oh, who is there that learns the story of this child of love that will not pause   2:4         ROSE MLTON: and drop a tear on the urn, the ashes of her young and broken heart? Who is there, as he stops to look and learn the mys- tery of the grave, will not think of Afton Water, and of her who sleeps by its murmuring stream, as he gives utterance to his soul: "Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her sleep " Mrs. Walsingham bent over her daughter, seeking in vain for some sign of returning consciousness. She took the cold, pulseless arm, and chafed it with her hand; but, when she re- placed it on the bedclothes, it rested without motion, as if it had been a lump of clay. In a word, nature seemed to have suspended her faculties, and unless something were done imme- diately, some powerful restorative applied, life itself would be- come extinct. But still, in her mute amazement, the thought would occur to the good old lady as she gazed on the face of her beautiful child, What hath caused this calamity? She did not suspect the cause, for she led a life of complete seclu- sion, on account of the physical infirmities of Mr. Walsingham; nor had any one dared to speak to her about the reports which implicated the character of her daughter, who was left to her- self on all occasions, to go and come, and pursue her own amusements, and visit balls, parties, and the theatre, as the spirit prompted her. Never, indeed, did mother have stronger reliance on the prudence of a daughter; never did mother in-. trust more implicitly to that daughter's discretion, even in the management of her household, and the ordering of its domestic arrangements. And now, in this unbounded confidence, to gaze on that fair face and see her daughter tius! The infirmities of Mr. Walsingham had rendered it impossi- ble for him to repair without considerable delay to the sick chamber of his child. In the meantime, his wife had dis- patched a servant for Dr. Garth, and was preparing a hot bath as the best restorative for the derangement which had taken place in her daughter's system. But how shall we describe that father's grief, his agony of heart, his anguish, his misery? He could not, nor he would not recognize the fact that his   A  VUUMANUNIJU. *      25 lovely Fanny, the sole daughter of his heart, was lying at the door of death, helpless, hopeless! The shock had come upon him too suddenly. He took her in his arms, and kissed he lips, and called her name. But still there was no answer. Hw pressed his cheek to hers, he unbound her hair, and took its tresses in his hands with almost childish simplicity, believing that her dream would soon be over, and her eye kindle once more with its wonted beams. He spoke to her in the words, the terms of endearment which had been his habit during the cherished years of her childhood, when she was the young hope, the little darling of his house, his home, his heart. Then he gazed at her fair face, fair even in its desolation, and seemed lost in wonder that a thing so beautiful should be so blighted- blighted in the bloom, the blossom of its spring, its splendor.  Yes, there she lay, unconscious and insensible: her pulse was gone, and you could only ascertain that she was yet among the living by holding a mirror to her lips. The slight mist collected on the glass and revealed the truth to Rose. The doctor now coming in, she informed him of this fact, and he, fortunately recognizing the theory that heat is life, determined to re- animate the patient by the exhibition of stimulating restora- tives. There are doctors who would have clipped those lovely tresses, and applied blistering plasters to Fanny's head, as if to draw the frenzy or the fever from her brain, just as negroes tie up the hair on the top of their heads to keep their palates from running down--there are doctors, too, who would have cut into her beautiful neck with a barbarous knife, and have inserted a seton; but, luckily for the cause of humanity, Dr. Garth was a man of sense, and exercised some reason in his practice. He saw that there was but little to add to the preparations of Mrs. Walsingham, and after trying to impress the parents with the belief that their daughter's case was not so desperate as they imagined, he withdrew from the chamber as quietly as he had entered it, leaving the impression on Rose, that for once   236        -ROSE MLTON: she had met with a man of medicine who understood the duties of his profession. * Rose remained by the side of her friend, absorbed in the deepest grief, until the first faint streak of day appeared through the curtains of the chamber. She then rose from the bed-for she had been lying by the side of Fanny--and after speaking a word or two of consolation to Mrs. Walsingham left the apartment and returned home. What was her object in rising thus early and leaving her friend, who was still lying in the same state of insensibility? It might have been imagined that her attention, her assiduity, were more requisite now that Fanny had been stricken down by a blow that prostrated both mind and body. But Rose had been reflecting as she reposed by the side of her friend, as to the means by which Fanny might be restored to herself and her afflicted family. She was no believer in medicines, as we have already said, but she knew that there is generally a remedy for most things, and why not a remedy for her friend's misfortune? It is well known that music has often restored reason, and particularly memory. Why, then, should not a remedy be found for the malady of Fanny? But then where was she to find that remedy? Would it not be ne- cessary for her to seeMr. Plantagenet? That was impossible; for she it was who had advised Mr. Hamilton to punish him for his dereliction to Fanny. The stroke must be a bold one, and she determined to have an intervieyv with Mrs. Plantagenet. The lights were still burning in the banquet hall at Planta- genet House, when the carriage of Miss Milton stopped at the door. In reply to the summons, a servant came yawning down the steps, and stated that his mistress was not yet visible, hav- ing just retired to her chamber after the dispersion of the guests. "Take this note," said Rose, "' and cause it to be delivered to Mrs. Plantagenet immediately," and, following the servant, she entered the house and took a seat in the drawing-room, de- termined to remain there until the lady of Plantagenet House did make her appearance; for such was the ardor of her tem-   A ROMANCE.          237 perament, the zeal of her nature, such the power of her will, that she suffered few impediments to stand between her object and its attainment. Hence that inflexible resolution which shunned no difficulties, and that fervent zeal which knew no defeat. It is true that she had advised Hamilton to revenge the cause of Fanny by challenging Plantagenet, but she was truly guiltless of any blood that might be shed in the conflict, from the fact that Plantagenet, not Hamilton, was the challenging party. This fact she had learned from a note sent to her by Hamilton, and will account for her not calling on that gentleman to sus- pend his action in the ease. "Mrs. Plantagenet," said Rose, as the old lady entered the room, "the only excuse I can make for calling on you at this unseasonable hour, is the importance of the communication I have to make, touching the welfare of the dearest friend I have in all the world. Will you excuse me, then?" "What has happened?" inquired Mrs. Plantagenet in great alarm, and evidently suspecting that some terrible catastrophe had overtaken her wild, erratic and gifted son. "It is well known, at least to me," said Rose, "that some- thing has happened which concerns the honor of your family, for a member of it has been guilty of crushing the heart of a gentle, virtuous girl." "I do not understand you," replied Mrs. Plantagenet, thun- derstruck by the bold charges brought against her son by Rose. "Am I to understand that my son has murdered any person?" "He has done more than that," replied Rose, the color mounting to her cheeks and burning into spots of glowing red; "he ls  e more than that for he has cruelly trampled on a pure and nob heart. What has murder so appalling in it as the assassination of character? A brave man may commit mur- der, but it takes the coward, the craven, to trample down and crush a woman's heart." "Assassination of character!" cried Mrs. Plantagenet, as a 21   238         ROSE MLTON-: tear trembled in hereye; " what do you mean, Miss Milton? Am I-to understand you as preferring these charges against my son?" "I do prefer them against him," replied Rose, " for he has: assisted in publishing reports derogatory to the honor of my friend. What I mean is this, that by giving credence to these reports,: he has trampled on her heart. I trust you understand me?" \"As yet I am utterly in the dark," observed Mrs. Planta- genet. ", How can my son be guilty of this thing, merely be- cause he believes certain reports to be true? Be candid with me?" "Mrs. Plantagenet," said Rose, approaching the old lady and taking her hand in the ardor of her feelings; "listen to me. Your son made overtufres of-marriage to Miss Walsingham, and sought to obtain .her consent in every conceivable manner, and even intimated that he would kill himself should she still persist in rejecting his suit. At this time, and in this :condi- tion of his'solicitation, he attempted to destroy hinmself by the assistance of Mr. Cavendish, but Mr. Hamilton, learning the cause of his misery-I had almost said his madness-sought an interview with Miss. Walsingham, and in the name of Mr. Plantagenet, placed his hand, and heart at the feet of Miss Wal- singham. He was successful; and returnhag to communicate his success to Mr. Plantagenet, what was his griefhis anguish, to find that Mr. Plantagenet having listened to malicious and defamatory reports derogatory to the character of Miss Walsing- ham, not only repudiated all alliance with that lady, but de- nounced her conduct and traduced her character. In vain it was urged that the reports were without foundation, as Mr. Middleton had denied their authenticity; in vain Mr. Planta- genet was told that the report against Miss Walsingham was a low and scandalous invention of some disappointed lover or rejected suitor; in vain he was told all these things. He per- sisted in his refusal to ratify the overture, of Mr. Hamilton, thus staining the character of Miss Walsingham, and wounding   A ROMANCE.          239 his friend, Mr. Hamilton, in every way as a man of honor. These things were communicated to me by Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Lexington, who asked my advice. I gave it without hesi- tation. It was this: That Mr. Hamilton should punish Mr. Plantagenet for his base abandonment of my friend. He con- sented, and left me with the determination of challenging Mr. Plantagenet instantly. But some one who obtained a knowledge of this-advice and determination, told Mr. Plantagenet of the resentment and resolution of Mr. Hamilton. This information roused his anger, and pretending that he had been outraged by the overture made to Miss Walsingham by Mr. Hamilton, he has challenged Mr. Hamilton to mortal combat." "Is this a dream?" asked the old lady, raising her hands in astonishment. "Can it be true-is it possible that my son has acted in this way, and that he is about to fight a duel with Mr. Hamilton?" and the old lady paused as if she still believed the things she had heard were merely passages in a dream. "It is all true to the very letter!" replied Rose; " but my object in coming here was not to give you pain. BI have per- formed my duty to my friend, to you and to myself, however painful it was in the performance. I repeat, my dear Mrs. Plantagenet, that my object in making you acquainted with these transactions was not to afflict you in any manner. But you must have known more of these things before the lapse of many days. The party given by your son last evening was a blind merely. But what I wish you to do in this business is this: Miss Walsingham is now lying at-the point of death in consequence of the cruel conduct of Mr. Plantagenet. She has not spoken one syllable since hearing of his abandonment, but seems bereft of all consciousness, and is, in truth, more dead "-than alive. Now in this conjuncture I have called, perhaps' imprudently, to request that you advise Mr. Plantagenet to call and see Miss Walsingham; his voice may revive her, and we must trust the rest to the Power that rules the world." When Rose was reciting these facts to Mrs. Plantagenet,   240         ROSE MLTON: that lady expressed by her emotions the agony that was tor- turing her heart. She frequently shed tears, and when Rose concluded, the old lady's face was buried in her hands. "I see it all!" she cried, bitterly weeping. "I now see the object of Mr. Cavendish in visiting my son so frequently, and the real object he had in making such a magnificent display last evening. What he has done I cannot recall, nor, indeed, do I think that his design was to ruin Miss Walsingham. I know my son to be incapable of such unprincipled conduct. But as I know his wayward temper and the ease with which he is influenced by malicious persons for the prosecution of their own evil purposes, I will join with you in doing what I can to restore Miss Walsingham. "I will, therefore, im- mediately accede to your request by summoning my son to our presence, when we can confer at leisure, for he has the highest respect for you." She now rung the bell, and a ser- vant appearing, she said: "Pizarro, go and tell your master that I desire his presence here for a few minutes!" To this the servant replied, that his master was not at home, that he had gone out after the gentlemen left, and had not since returned. This statement completely unnerved Mrs. Planta- genet, and seeing in a flood of light the glaring conduct of her son, she uttered a cry of pain, and fainted in the arms of Rose. "Where is my son?" were the first words she uttered on recovering. - "Take me to him! Pizarro, order the carriage. Will you accompany me?" she said to Rose. My own carriage is at the door," replied Rose, " and I entreat, my dear Mrs. Plantagenet, that you will accompany me. I have particular reasons that you do so. Pray let me assist you in this affair, for I know more of what is transpiring than you do." Mrs. Plantagenet having consented to this arrangement, and sent messages to Mrs. and Miss Godolphin, and Edith, now   A  JOIuMAINCEI.        241 took the arm of Rose, and descended to the street. In another moment they were dashing rapidly for the suburbs of Afton. CHAPTER XXX. BuT what intelligence did Rose possess as to the particular direction the belligerents had taken? Was she certain that the parties had left the city? In reply it may be stated, that she knew neither one nor the other, but acting on the impulse of the moment, had determined to do something towards ob- structing the bloody scheme, and trusted as usual to her genius as her monitor in the emergency. The carriage had not, therefore, proceeded beyond Wentworth Street, when she directed the servant to proceed to Mrs. Hamilton's, hoping that she might obtain an interview with Mr. Hamilton, and if so, then she would be able to take fortune at the flood, and float on to a favorable conclusion of her enterprise. It was therefore with a heart bounding with anticipation, that she looked at the house of Mrs. Hamilton, as the carriage rolled to the door. The ladies got out, entered the mansion, and encountered Mrs. Hamilton, who was superintending the ar- rangements of the breakfast table. Her surprise at a visit so unexpected, actually confounded her, and she paused in arrang- ing the cups, as if she heard the cry of fire. "Mrs. Hamilton," said Rose, advancing, "your good nature will excuse our precipitancy, when you learn that Mrs. Planta- genet and myself are engaged in an affair of the last-import- ance. The only excuse we can make is the necessity of the case." "Has anything"-but before she could proceed with her question, Rose, who observed the anguish of her heart, ventur- ed to interrupt her, by saying- 21*   42         BOBS  M-ILTON: 'T- pray yow- pardon me. But I desire to have an inters iew with your son, if but for one moment. Will you be good nough to send a message, stating that Miss Milton desires ne moment's conversation -wm him?" This request surprised Mrs. Hamilton more than ever. She ndeavored to apeak, but her voice failed her and after re . eoting a moment,she thok u-ps little- bell from-the:table and ang it.- A servait obeyed the call, to whom Mrs. Hamilton aid:- '"Bid-Archibald'c!ome to me." .The servant went to his aaste's room, and after- the lapse of:a few moments, returned- hith-a' lette, stating that his master was not at home; but hatihe had found a letter lying on his dressing-table, and sup. osing it wasintendied for some member of the family, he had rentured to bring it to her. Mrs.: Hamilton toQk the: letter, ndperceiving from the superscription that it was addressed to Lerbroke the seal with a trembling -hand, and' read the -fol- owing letterfrom her son:-    : -  I have recently my dearest mother, been plaoed in a posi- ion the most mortifying that one can conceive, andfrom which Eshall not .be able to relieve myself without exposing that life rhichyouwhave so long cherished as the breath of your exist- mnce. -I feel in my own heart the anguish that will torture Fours, when you learn this from me, into whose. breast you lave always sought-to instil the noblest principles and the )urest hotor. : Those principles, those- sentiments, are now a part of-my nature how, then, can I do violence to them by submitting to injury, o by. suffering injustice? If you ask for proofs, what can I answer? It would be wrong for me to-un- veil -the mystery of' this affair at this time, even to you, for lie reason that the character of a sweet and lovely girl is in- volved, and until she is restored to society by a verdict of 'ac- quittal, I shall never mention' her name, dear though it be to me as my own honor.' I shall not add torture to your tears, which I. know will fall freely when you read this, but I must apprise you that my antagonist is Mr. Plantagenet; that we   are to meet at. -the Oaks,' and that, the meeting may result in the death of one, or bth. Have you the firmness-to en- counter this unfortunate intelligence-? If you have, then it is necessary for me to state that should I not return to Afton on .to-morrow evening, you will send to' the Oaks;' "  -  * The' letter dropped from her hands, and she fell into the arms of Rose; for those last words conjured to her eye the frightful image of her :on weltering in his blood I She kuew his nature, his resolution, his gallantry, his unshakenfirmness and constancy-; :but she, dreaded that-in encountering then-im- petuous temper of Plantagenet, her son would be hiurrieaway by passion, and forget that prudence which she had instil- led into his oharater. : Prudence !O what arworld of thought there is in that single word.

"I am," replied Mrs. Hamilton, "and were I a man this instant, I would not hesitate to fight a duel, andfespecially in defence of a woman's honor.

The pensive air-the con- enimplative mood of Plantagenet, on the previous evening, when-all around him-was in a state of-excitement and festal uproar-inolined him to hope that the application of some healing remedy-was not yet too late, and that Ihe might effect an amicable adjustment between the belligerents.   A ROMANOE.              245   .He;.e as walking -along the gallerey,or piazza, full of rthis thought, when who should bring 'him to a.sudden. halt but Rose. Of all the persons-on earth whom:he expected to meet -at Mrs. Hamilton's, on that.morning Rose was the last, though she was not least in his niindy,for her name, her noble nature, her high- pirit, andher extraordinary influene over Hamilton, hadfixed: her: i-nhis mind-as a star that wasifor goodbrevil, toiinfluence the world in- which he lived. 'Nor did he blame herafor the advice she had given to Hamilton.- He knew that, unless Plantsgenet acted with more prudence than was native to is genius, the small flame that had been kindled -between Hamilton and himself would blaze up, and burn to ashes every particle of friendship, which had existed from-infancy to man- hood. He was not disappointed, therefore,'when Plantagenet, inflamed by the secret and sinister influence which moulded his actions, determined to assume the initiative in his alterca. tion with Hamiilton. :But, in spite of this knowledge, he had been lulled .into security by Plantagenet's conduct during the festive scene, for even there he had arranged all-his plans with Cavendish, and was :to leave the city when the last guest should have left his house. ' Nay, so completely was Tx*ington deceived.by the conduct of Plantagenet, that he. had induced Mr. Godolphin to return- home with him, that they might visit Hamilton together the next morning, and induce him, if pos- sible, to delay' appointing the time and place-of meeting,;4hose rights accruing to  amrilton as the challenged party. Hence his visit the next -morning, and hence his surprise at encoun. tering Miss Milton. He stopped suddenly, gazing at her in mute astonishment, but Rose, advancing close to him, said, in a voice quick and hurried:- "Mr. Lexington, they have gone to fight I" -' Is there no chance of preventing it ?'" he asked, supposing that she had receive later and fuller intelligence on the sub- ject than-himself.   ..

"-Mr. Plantagenet," said Colonel York, { I have a letter for. you from my friend, Mr. Hamilton. I will thank you to read it, and shall be happy to hear any suggestions on the subject of it that may occur to you." :Plantagenet took the. letter from the hands of Colonel York, with the same air of gloomy abstraction which had oppressed him in spite of the gayety of all around him. But now a changecame over him that was like magic. iA he read,- his eye brightened, and the beautiful' smile for which he was dis- tinguished oncO more- broke on his face likesunshine, chasing away the eloud which had hung lowering from his brow. .And - rith- this change of feature, his whole manner changed.: He delivered the letter to Cavendish, with a smile of exultation. "Read that," said he, "and give me your opinion." "Thisnote designates 'The Oaks 'as the place of meeting; and-tomorrowat twelve o'clock as the time. We have scarcely  time to reaah that place, even if we start immediately."  t "But can we reach- 'The Oaks ' by twelve o'elock to-mor- row?" asked Plantagenet.  - "It'is just epoibli," repliid Cavendish. "Then," observed Plantagenet to Colonel York, "I shall meet Mri-Hamilton at the time and. place appointed."  "Adieu, gentlemen!" s aid Colonel York, and turning, left the house. He sprung into his carriage, and drove'rapidly-    A M. JAiVaaN UAJN ' -    zf to Hamilton's;- That genleman was pacing to, and fro the large hall of his splendid mansion, expecting the return of Co- lonel York, with buring impatience; and a hour after hour- drew on-and& on-and on, to that bourne from whence notra- veller returns, he felt in hisheart--yea, his heart of hearts, the dread sensions that will afflict the bravest at sueh a time, at such an hour, and in such a cause. -e who goes forthto fight the battles of his country, is blessed as its protector, its guar- dian, its champion; but he that goes under the cover of. ilght to fight a;duel, feels in his very soul that his mission is evil- and that the eye of God is on him I "Well," said Hamilton, as Colonel York entered the room, "what news from the adversary? i iit tobe a pitched battle?" 'He will be at the place and at the time appointed," re- plied Colonel York. "Now, then, let ous make- our. little atr rangementsi and set off for the new Marengo." He advanced to a table, opened amahogany ease, took out a pair of pistols -they were' "saw handles '-.exmined their condition, and replaced them carefully in their quiet berths,-the irn- infants, that were to break the heart of many a human mother's heart, with its sharp and scathing cry I He then examined the bulk lets, the pathes, the powder, and carefully depositing a num- ber of thimbles as gauges for the exact quantity of powder which was to be used, and which he could calculate to the pre- cise amount of grains,/ Colonel York closed the box, locked it, and placing the. key in his pocket, turned round for the pur- pose of announcing to Hamilton that the weapons were ready for service. .But-t what was his astonishment to find that the room was empty? -Where was Hamilton?- Had his nerves failed him at the last moment?

And his blessed mother-;-where-was shie- :,Was she forgotten? O, no. He resolved to see her-to tell her all-the torture of his position -the inexplicable versatility of Plantagenet-and his sacred engagement to vindicate the character of Miss Walsingham. But it would beD too much for her, woman as sher as, and he determined to write toher on the subject. Over that letter did he shed inany--yes, many a' bitter tear, for? how could he imoher ,that essence of -the soul, the 'sacred'tear-when he thought of her-who gave him eexistence? and who cherished his life, by sacrificing herself in the heroic devotion of a mo- ther? 7 Nor was Rose forgotten inuthat momentof tender emo- ti6n.'

He sid farewell, but still wrote on, and when atlast he had signed, sealed, and superscribeid the letter, he put it not on the table -but on his heart I -      ;  wa It was pnor considerably-past midnight, andevery thing be- ing arranged for the journey, HaTnilton and York left the house without disturbing any of its inmates entered the carriage that had been prepared for their reception, and departed from the ity.        -  .  The distance from. Afton to 'the Oaks" is not more than twenty miles, but such is the impracticable condition of the road,- from its depth of sand, that it. was barely possible for the parties-to reach their destination at the appointed- hour. The spot selected was quite retired, and although it- was adja- cents or, in fact, the avenue to a large plantation, yet-the pro- prietor, Mr. Lyttleton, was then in Europe, and the premises under the superintendence of an. old family servant. - -t was in the avenue-itself- that the parties were to meet, and it may be necessary, therefore, to say a word-in reference to'its extent and Gothic appearance. - The avenue is composed of live oaks,   :A ROMA-NOE.          251 which were planted in the year'1750,;and presents, at this time, the appearance of more real grandeur than can be found in any other cultivated spot '-ih America. It is not more than half a mile in length, but such is the stupendous magnitude of the trees, that a tall man, standing at either end of the ave- nue, looks like a pigmy, and-when surveying its magnificence, it -is impossible to avoid recalling the scene at Dover Cliff as described by Edgar,in King Lear. The mighty arms of these: old oaks are intrlocked above, excluding the sun, and support. ingigreat masses of snowy moss, which hang like clouds along the: convex arch; their outer limbs touch the earth on either side along the -entire line, and- the immense bodies of these trees seem pillared in their strength to resfit the assaults of -time. Here and there a bird was seen to flit about the clouds of moss, and ever and anon the mocking bird's notes were heard from the mansion at the head of the avenue, but -his eloquent tongue was hushed' occasionally by the plaintive cry of the whippoorwill, or the pert call of the-partridge. Here and there, and chewing, and still chewing, was some ancient cow, or superannuated. racer, and at the head- of the avenue, as if in defiance of all this grandeur, of all this antiquity, of all this majestic scenery, a peafowl tookf uphis position, spread" his tail, and? glanced up at the sun, to see what effect his matchless beauty would have on that distant and desolate orb, for assuredly he looked as if- he believed the sun itself was in- debted for all his brightress to that resplendent tail  "I wonder," said Hamilton, descending from the carriage, as it entered this gigantic colonnade "I wonder at the ability of man to build such a temple as this, and his inability to create the materials of which it is composed; or- even that smallest strip of moss that hangs like a cloud, rent and torn to fragments in a storm. And yet, to construct such a won- derful monument from such small materials, would most surely indicate his divine origin, and that we are, indeed, the crea- tures of the great first cause, which made all things from   262         ROSE MLTON: nothing! Do you know, York, that when I view such things as this, I am half inclined to believe that we are arts of the great Creator, just as grains of dirt are parts of the earth we inhabit? I know that this doctrine has been condemned- that it is heretical to say that the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the fire that, warms us, are not only the elements which make nature, but God himself. But if we be not a por- tion of the Creator, what, then, is the soul? Whence comes it? I Whither doth it go, when disembodied by death We are told that it returns io God. If so, it must have sprung from him, and if this be true; why, then, the soul of man is not only a portion of the universe, but. of its Creator-' the father of all in every age adored.'"  'To what purpose do we reason on such subjects?" asked Colonel York. "I have heard one of our greatest statesmen say, that there are times when we always go wrong when we begin to reason. I do not, indeed, profess to comprehend its wisdom, but this [ do know, and believe, my dear friend," and he grasped the arm of Hamilton in his nervous hand; -"I do believe that our greatest happiness arises from our' ignorance of future events. Why, then, seek a knowledge that would overwhelm you with desolation and despair?" "Alas," replied Hamilton, "why do I hunger? .Why do I thirst? Why do I strive to ascertain the result of an experi- ment?  If there was an Oracle secreted in these oaks, as there was in that of Dodona, I would consult, confront my destiny! What am I? A man. What shall I be to-morrow? Who shall answer me, and say: 'You exist, and, therefore, must exist forever?' How forever? and if forever, not as I am, but as a spirit-a something impalpable and intangible, but having been created, can never perish! I stand now on the brink of the grave. I see what I am, but who shall tell me that, if I fall and- fill that grave, the spark of life, the soul-- shall be reunitqd in the shades to the Creator whom I have never knownt save in this world?"    A ROMANCE.: ' "I acknowledge," said Colonel York, "that to every reflect- ing man, who occupies your present position, such sentiments as these are likely to agitate his mind. It is impossible for one who is about to point a pistol at the breast of a fellow creature, not to feel anxious for the future. But you will pardon me for saying that, if a man's happiness is owing to his ignorance of a future state, his chief hope should induce him to believe not only in the existence of that state, but of its happiness." "I do believe in it, most sacredly!" cried Hamilton, with the deepest fervor. "I do believe in it! Who created all that?" said he, pointing to the magnificent scenery, and the brilliant sky, "and was all that created--was man, himself, created merely as an idle show? No, no, no. Nothing was ever created in vain. But what shall be the future of man-- of the best of men-who shall say here, that beyond this world-in the grave-the mystery is revealed? The dead, the most ignorant man, who died a moment since-even since we began this conversation-is wiser than the wisest man now alive! Who, then7 would not embrace death, as freely as I now embrace thee; my friend?"' and folding Colonel York in his arms, Hamilton wept like a child. CHAPTER     XXXII. THE presentiment of death which had absorbed the mind of Hamilton was the occasion of great concern to Colonel York. elo knew, indeed, that such a vision would intrude on the magination of the bravest man, and he recalled similar in- itances of this strange hallucination-if, indeed, that be hallu- rination which springs from the deep religious fervor of the ieart-which are recorded by the historians of our revolutions 22*   29%         ROSE MLTON: ary war. He remembered the story told by Lee of the gallant Webster, the bravest and most accomplished soldier in the British army and, although he deplored its appearance at any time, but particularly at this momenthe did nothing, and said nothing more to rebuke or reprove the agitation of his friend. They, now walked up the avenue, occasionally stopping to survey the magnificent scenery and note the hush of nature, which the sharp cry of the partridge, or the plaintive note of the whippoorwill, made so painfully palpable. They stood arm in arm, silently surveying this scene, neither uttering a word or giving a voice to that fulness of the heart which will not overflow in words merely, but, "find tongues in trees, books in running brooks, sermons in stones,. and good in every- thing." But they were not permitted a long indulgence in the luxury of these reflections. The echoing of a horn in the vicinity of "The Oaks" announced the arrival of another party, and turn- ing towards the sound, they became aware that Plantagenet had arrived. -As the carriage rolled by Hamilton and York, Plantagenet very courteously saluted them, and, in truths so did Cavendish (who was seated on the box), but, having re- moved the horn from his mouth for that purpose, and the salu- tation being made, he now replaced it, and blew away as if he was calling up a bevy of dogs for a stag hunt. Colonel York could not help smiling at this characteristic levity of Caven- dish, but Hamilton was inexpressibly shocked. The notes thrilled through him, but the only emotion he betrayedT was in the quivering of his eyelids, those trusty indicators of wounded sensibility.. And now the parties approached. Colonel York advanced tomeet Cavendish, whilst Plantagenet and Hamilton stdod at some distance gazing not at each other, but at the mirror which was presented to their mind's eye-the mirror in which they were the principal figures, comrades in childhood, friends in manhood, entering the world together, and participating in all *I   its pains and pleasures, like two young lovers; but now-dash that mirror to the ground, and let its fragments multiply. "Colonel York'" said Cavendish, advancing, and taking out his watch, "this is the place and this the time." 'If the end be as good as the beginning," replied York, "we shall be truly fortunate. I trust that we shall conduct this painful affair in a spirit of mutual forbearance and conces- sion. In addition to this, I think it my duty to my principal, to myself, and to the Community in which we Jive,-that I should make one more effort to: avert this unnatural rencontre. What isthe difficulty between the parties that may not be honorably adjusted? Surely, there must be a remedy some- where in the human heart for its errors; and if to err be na- ture, to rectify error, in the words of the immortal Washington, is glory." "I can see no possible remedy for this difficulty," replied Cavendish, in a tone of cold indifference; "and, in fact, the parties have gone' so far that it would be impossible for them to recede or to retrace their steps at the present moment. We have met to fight. We have not met to consult about adjust- ing the quarrel between our respective friends, but to satisfy their injured honor. Indeed, why attempt a reconciliation? Suppose there be mutual concessions, and an amicable adjust- ment, what ensues? The parties can never be friends again; the link that bound them is dissolved-nothing can revive the fall of friendship." "I grant all you say," replied Colonel York; "but still I think that an adjustment of this difficulty is advisable. Do you imagine that the only principle involved in this affair is the friendship of the parties? Have they not relatives- mothers, sisters, brothers-who would shed the last drop of -their blood to stop this sanguinary affair? Is not society in- terested? Who compose the state? But above all these con- siderations-above that of mother, sister, brother, society, state -stands the Eternal order, Thou shalt not kill!"   256   -     ROSE MLTON: "Colonel York," said Cavendish, "you should have thought of these things before accepting the challenge of Mr. Plantage- net; but, having accepted, it is now too late to open the dis- cussion. There is a time in all discussions when the argument is exhausted; and, in affairs like this, the argument is ex- hausted when the principals arrive von the ground for the pur- pose of satisfying their honor and of settling the dispute. I have. nothing more to say on the subject." "But I have!" replied Colonel York, drawing up his person with supreme disdain, and giving Cavendish a look so fiery that it might have revelled on the lightning's wing; and, turn-  ing proudly on his heel, approached Plantagenet.  "Mr. Plantagenet," said Colonel York, in- that eloquent '! voice which, in moments of excitement, displayed all the emo- tions of his princely heart, "I venture-I take on myself the responsibility of saying a word to you before we proceed any further in this. distressing business. You know me too well, sir, to- believe that I would stoop to make such an overture, save from the worthiest motives, the duty we all owe to God and man. I scorn, therefore, to make any appeal that is un- worthy of the occasion. But let me ask you, on your honor as a gentleman, if you were not on the ground selected for this duel, and the question were put to you bya- man from whom you had no secrets, whether this difficulty with Mr. Hamilton could not be honorably adjusted, would you not reply in the affirmative? ' I know, sir, that you would. I know that your heart wouldswell into your throat, and that you would bless the man who should reconcile this difference. You know that I know this, for it was not yesterday, nor the day before, that I became acquainted with you.: Why, then, should we discard all our reason, and suppress all the emotions of the heart, sim- ply because we stand on the ground chosen for this duel? I appeal to your better nature, that elevated nature which sus- tains a gentleman in every position, to express the real senti-   '     A ROMANCE.           257 ments of your heart, and grant me authority to adjust this difficulty." This address went to the heart of Plantagenet, for he had the highest respect fol the many high and noble qualities-I had almost said natures--of Colonel York; and if ever he was to exhibit his reverence or respect for anything, It was now, when he stood opposed to-one who had so recently been the friend of his soul, and whose blood he was seeking according to the laws of a barbarous code, which reduced-him to a level with the brutes of the field, and made him as trivial as the birds of the air. In the hidden Warmth of his heart he grasped the hand of Colonel York, and pressed it to his bosom as he said:- "I am ready to do anything that is just and proper. If Mr. Cavendish consents to an adjustment, I shall ratify it; but, as I have placed this entire matter in his hands, the final answer must come from him. I am now to do as he directs, for such is the custom on occasions like this, as I understand." The joy depicted on the face of Colonel York when he heard Plantagenet utter the words "just and proper," gave way to despondency, and finally to despair, when the fate of his over- ture was referred to the tender mercies of Mr. Cavendish. He paused, reflected a moment, and then, with a bitter sigh, re- marked to Cavendish, "We are ready!" The seconds immediately proceeded to select a spot, and having stepped off ten paces, placed their principals in positions confronting each other, the road running between them. They then loaded the pistols in the presence of each other, handing one to their principals, and reserving one to themselves, re- spectively, and confronted each other at the opposite corners of the square. The word had been won by Colonel York, but he delayed the action from respect to the feelings that must fill every honest heart on such a solemn occasion. Let us seize that moment of delay and observe the picture. There they stood! Four young men in the first bloom of early manhood; all of remarkable personal beauty, except Colonel York, who more than   258         ROSE' MLTON: made up for that personal defect in the exalted character of his principles. They all occupied the very first rank in society -and that society the proudest in America. They were: pos- sessed of unbounded wealth, particularly Plantagenet, whose landed estate was not inferior to that of John Randolph of Roanoke. All that wealth could purchase was theirs; all that society could achieve for them by its favors was theirs; and I must not exclude Cavendish from these favors, when the so- ciety' itself did not exclude him; nal, everything, that could render one happy in life, as they were happy in the future, was theirs to enjoy. But there they stand in hostile array! with fire in their eyes, destruction in their hearts, and revenge burning through all and destroying all the finer, the better, the softer feelings of man's noble nature. And what a contrast did they present! The firm, but melancholy expression of Hamil- ton's face, was strongly contrasted by the flashing- eye and im- petuous look and bearing of Plantagenet, who occasionally cast an impatient- glance toward Colonel York,' expecting him to open the engagement by the usual question addressed to the principals. But York was resolved not to enter precipitately into this solemn affair; he had done his best to arrest its action, but failing in that, from the indifference of the opposite party, he determined to consult his own sense of propriety, as far as he was at liberty to do so; in consequence of having- won the word-that-is, of having won the power of beginning the fight, and partly of conducting it by the style he should. adopt in pronouncing the words of command, which-is of incalculable importance, more so, indeed, than any other preliminary of these sanguinary engagements. He who wins the word 'may be said to hold the life of his principal's antagonist in his hands, for the reason that the principals have been practised to 'fire ac- cording to the style of their seconds, and the novel manner of the antagonist's second always takes them by surprise. But it was considerably beyond the time fixed by the challenge, and Colonel York perceived the. necessity of commencing the ,    fi   A ROMANCE.           259 engagement. He therefore called out in a loud, firm, distinct voice- "Gentlemen! are you ready?" to which Hamilton and Plantagenet answered in the affirmative, that they were ready. "Fire!" exclaimed Colonel York, and after the lapse of a moment he began to count in the'same loud, firm voice, "one -two-three--halt."  But there was no necessity for his counting, as the antagonists had discharged their weapons at the word "fire;"Hamilton's ball lodging in the body of the oak in the rear of Plantagenet, and Plantagenet's ball lodging within an inch of his own toes, his pistol having gone off at the word, partly on account of his hasty temper, and partly because his fire was drawn by Hamilton, there being few duels in which the fire of one of the parties is pot drawn by that of his antagopist.          . Colonel York and Cavendish approached each other, remark- ing that their friends had behaved bravely; but as Hamilton was the challenged party, Colonel York studiously forbore hint. ing the propriety of an adjustment, which usually occurs at this stage of the proceedings. They next advanced to their princi- pals; received the pistols, reloaded them in the presence of each other, replaced them in the hands of the antagonists, and resumed their relative positions as before. But now again Cavendish gave the word by asking-"Gentlemen, are you ready?". The same answer was received, and the same..order to fire was given. At the first flash of- the pistols Hamilton staggered from his position, and when the smoke that hung be- tween the parties like a cloud had slowly moved away, he was seen at first on his knce, and then as if by a powerful effort he resumed his position, and delivered his pistol to Colonel York without making any remark. "You are woupded, sir, and I fear dangerously!" remarked Colonel York. "It is nothing," replied Hamilton;." but I will task you for a glass of water, if you please."   260         ROSE MLTON: The water was brought; and O, what luxury to the parched and thirsty lips of that noble youth was conveyed in that single draught of cold water from the spring I He drained the cup, and felt as if he could willingly lie down and die by a stream of water. And now again the seconds approached each other, Caven" dish remarking, that their friends had behaved themselves "nobly," and Colonel York replying, that they had. But as no suggestion proceeded from Cavendish touching an adjust- ment, Colonel York began reloading Hamilton's pistol. Plan. tagenet, who had perceived that Hamilton was wounded, now advanced towards York and Cavendish; but the moment the latter saw that his principal badleft his position, he exolaimed, with consideral vehemence :- Return to your position, sir!" and, without uttering a word, Plantagenet did as he was ordered. "Now, sir," said Colonel York to Cavendish, with cool de- termination, let us see that ofu own weapons are in order!" The allusion of this speech did not escape Cavendish, and he' assented with seeming vivacity to the proposaltas if it would do him no small pleasure to have a bout with York himself. Now again everything was in readiness, principals, pistols, and all; and at the word which was given by Colonel York, the parties both fell, weltering in their blood; but the wound of Hamilton, aggravated bythat previously received, rendered it impossible for him to rise from the ground without the as- sistance of Colonel York. As for Plantagenet, hoe as stand- ing again, but was compelled to lean against Cavendish for support. Here it would be supposed that this murderous affair should have ceased. But noI The principals had yielded themselves implicitly into the hands of their seconds- and every one knows that seconds are generally so very careful. of the honor of their principals, that nothing can satisfy them but death. I would except Colonel York from this sweeping assertion, but   ,A ROMANCE.      .    261 he had used every effort to prevent the duel, and now that it had commenced, he had sworn that it should not be arrested by any overture of his own.  "If your friend is sufficiently recovered," remarked Caven- dish, with great levity of manner, "we will proceed to busi- ness.' Proceed to business! yes, that was the very word, proceed to business; .as if they were butchers, and this grove a human shambles. God of heaven! spare these men of a perverse generation, for they know not what they do. Oblige* me by loading both pistols," replied Colonel York; "for though my friend is ready to proceed, I am not able to quit his side." In truth, Hamilton was sitting on the knee of Colonel York, who was kneeling on the ground; and in this position the last round was fought by Hamilton. In this last contest, the antagonists exhibited the same con- trast as in the first, the same steady bearing of Hamilton, the same restless impetuosity of the other. .Hamilton took the pistol from the hands of Colonel York, and supported it on his thigh, for he was sitting on the knee of Colonel York, and fought in that position. Plantagenet was able, it is true, to hold his pistol, but he had to support himself by resting his left arm on the shoulder of Cavendish, This was the relative position of the parties, when Cavendish gave the word to fire. The ball from Hamiilton's pistol tore up the earth at the foot of Plantagenet, but the ball from the pistol of Plantagenet was truer in its aim, for it tore into the breast of Hamilton, who fell insensible, and fainted away dead in the arms of Colonel York. 23    262        ROSE MLTON: CHAPTER XXXIII. THE moment that Hamilton fell into the arms of Colonel York, the carriage with Rose and Mrs. Plantagenet entered the avenue of oaks, Lexington and Godolphin having already galloped forward for the purpose of riding between the par. ties, at the risk of their lives. But they were too late. The last shot was fired. The foes had fallen; for Plantagenet, ex- hausted by the loss of blood, sunk down to the earth powerless, after discharging his pistol. Lexington threw himself from his horse, and taking Hamilton in his arms; endeavored to trace the direction of the ball. He tore away the vest and shirt, and placed his hand on a letter which was wet with blood. This wad the letter to Rose from Hamilton, of which we have already made mention. He displaced it, and wiping away the blood, endeavored to read the direction. At that moment he heard a sob, and raising his eyes, saw that Rose was standing by the side of Hamilton. "Miss Milton," said Lexington, trembling with emotion, and in a voice scarcely. audible, "here is 'a letter that is directed to you, if my-imperfect vision does not deceive me.. I request that you will receive it, as it may be of importance to our unfortunate friend." At theword "friend," Hamilton opened his eyes, and after gazing at Lexington, he closed them again, as if resigned to the everlasting sleep, But a piercing cry from Rose caused him to open his eyes again; and now he perceived that she was a witness of his humiliation, and at the instant, he seemed to be unmanned, for a tear fell from his fading eye, and A deep groan announced the excruciating pain that he was suffering.   A  OU1MANNU.         263 "Colonel York," said Rose, in a voice of suppressed emo- tion, "is all hope extinct?" "I think not," he replied, "unless Mr. Hamilton is bleeding internally." The angels' whisper could not have fallen in more celestial tones on the ear of Rose. She flew to the carriage for the purpose of procuring some restoratives, and making a sign to Lexington, that gentleman was by her side in a moment. "Quick, quick," she said, "he must have a surgeon, for there is none on the ground," and singular as the fact may appear, it was nevertheless true, for both parties had forgotten to provide themselves with that indispensable patron of the fine arts-a chirurgeon. But, in the meantime', olonel York and Godolphin removed Hamilton to the Mansion House. They laid him on a couch and- bathed his brow, and gave him water to drink. Rose knelt on the floor by his side, and supported his head on her arm, occasionally sprinkling his face with ether, and wetting his lips with lavender. In this state of partial insensibility Hamilton remained for more than two hours, at the end of which time he seemed gradually to sink, and when the doctor arrived, he had fainted for the second time. There seemed to be no longer any hopes for him; and for seconds at a time, it was impossible to say whether he was dead or alive, the only hope for life consisted in this, that there was no rattle in the throat-that infallible sign'of ap- proaching death. The surgeon took advantage of his patient's insensibility, to examine his wounds. He shook his head re- peatedly and solemnly, refused to answer any question, and finally said, that if the patient did not expire before the next day, that his health might be restored, and his wounds healed by ' the first intention." His scientific jargon mystified Mr. Godolphin to such a degree, that he begged to be informed as to the possibility of carrying "the first intention" into effect without delay, as the second intention might defeat the cura- tive powers of the first intention. But the surgeon shook his   264         ROSE MLTON:  head again-a wise surgeon always shakes his head-and keep- ing his hand on the pulse of Hamilton, seemed to be studying the present condition of his patient's system by its dial, for the pulse has been well called the dial-plate of the human system. But it was gone entirely, save a momentary throb that faintly struggled up from his bubbling heart. Still, the dew upon his lip and brow, indicated that life was not extinct. Rose retired from the apartment, when the surgeon proceeded to dress the wounds,-and wrote a brief note to Mrs.* Hamilton, stating the condition of her son, and the utter impossibility of his being removed to Afton for the present. This note she dis- patched by one of the servants who had accompanied her, or. dering him to make haste, post-haste, in his journey. She now took up the letter of Hamilton, opened it, and read as follows:- "It is impossible for me to express, my dear Rose, the pain- ful, the conflicting emotions which agitate my heart at this moment. I feel as if I am enveloped in a mystery, that defies all power of solution; and a cloud oppresses my brain, which fills my heart with apprehension for the future. What that future is to reveal, what is to be the result of events that are hastening to their consummation, and how they will affect the fortunes of all whom I esteem, honor and adore, afflicts me with such anguish, that I now turn for consolation, and fly for refuge,to that heart which is the paradise of my passionate. love. "You will see at a glance, my sweet Rose, the scope of my meaning, and that it is the intensity of my love for you, that fills me with these melancholy forebodings for the future. But I cannot brook the idea of encountering Mr. Plantagenet, with- out stating that every effort tending to impress him with the outrageous iniquity of his conduct to Miss Walsingham, has been exerted and exhausted; and that 'the malign influences which have been staining his character, have at length finally succeeded in corrupting it, by inducing him to assume the initia-   A ROMANCE.           265 tive. In this position of our controversy, it will rest with him to terminate the quarrel without a sanguinary struggle--a right ac- corded him by the laws of honor-and which I deplore, because I really feel no personal animosity against Mr. Plantagenet, and because it will subject others besides himself to the malice of the miscreant by whom he is influenced and inflamed. But it is not for myself that I feel in this emergency. It is for you-for my mother-for 'Miss Walsingham-for Mrs. Plan- tagenet! In almost any event, the community, which is-truly our world, will be convulsed to its very centre. The friend- ships of a century-the peace of happy families-will yield to enmity, and misery, and mourning. And should I fall, should it be my fate to die, and leave no trace ofminy name, will you cherish my mother, and be to her, in her desolation, what I once fondly, hoped you would have been in the moments of bliss-the bride of her son?" . The tears of Rose fell thick and fast as she read the touch- ing words of Hamilton, for the mysterious forebodings of dis- aster, which breathed in dvery line, had received a terrible ful- filment in the torn and bloody letter which had rested on his heart. And need we say that the declaration of love filled Rose with the bitterest anguish? The blood on that letter was shed by her hand! It was by her advice that Hamilton had sought to revenge the wrongs of Miss Walsingham. It was lby her advice he had gone into the field of honor, and sought the life of a fellow creature; It was by her advice that the friendship -of a century, and the peace of happy families would be de- stroyed, and the whole community overwhelmed with the dis- asters of this dreadful duel. She reproached herself bitterly. She kissed the letter, and placed it in her bosom, as if its- pres- ,ence there would reanimate and revive the sinking features of her lover-he who had gone forth as her champion, and fought for female virtue, and for suffering innocence! She-wasyet weeping, when a hand was placed on her head, 23*   266        ROSE MLTON: and, looking up, she met the tearful eye of Mrs. Plantagenet. That good old lady had dressed the wounds of her son without the assistance of Cavendish, to whom she refused to speak, or hold any communication whatever as she was convinced that the difficulties between Hamilton and her son might have been adjusted, but for the advice and counsel of his debauched companion. To her son she had not uttered one word of re- proof, and in fact had actually suppressed the agitation of her heart, fearing the effect her grief would have oxr his mind, in his present weak and exhausted condition. Having per- formed all the duties demanded by the necessity of the case, she recommended Plantagenet to the care of the surgeon, and now sought an interview with Rose, determined, if possible, to induce a reconciliation between these unfortunate friends, but perceiving the grief of Rose, she had paused some time neav the door of the apartment, doubting the propriety of venturing -to intrude on the solitude and sorrow of her young friend. But fearing that Hamilton might die before the object she had in view could be effected, she advanced, and placed her hand on the head of Bose, saying:- "I have sought you, Miss Milton, for the purpose of con- sulting you as to the propriety of suggesting a reconciliation between Mr. Hamilton and my son." Rose made no reply, for -her heart was full to bursting, but silentlydelivered to Mrs. Plantagenet the letter from Hamilton to herself. Mrs. Plantagenet received the letter, but with a shudder, and let it fall .in terror, as she saw the blood that stained it, ex- claiming, "-There is blood upon it 1" Rose took up the fallen letter, kissed it fervently, and read that portion of it relating to the feelings still existing on the part of Hamilton to Plantagenet. When Rose read the words, "I really feel no personal animosity against Mr. Plantagenet," the good old lady uttered a cry of joy, and folding Rose in her arms, said, as a: smile broke through her tears-   A ROMANCE.           267 ' Noble boy! I have ever thought him the noblest of our young men, and this avowal justifies my opinion of his prini- ples, And II will answer for my son. He has not,:het cannot have the slightest motive for cherishing illfeelings towards Mr. Hamilton.,   But, my dear Mrs. Plantagenet," observed Rose, with deep feeling and respect, " there is one difficulty in the way that is insurmountable, and will defeat any efforts on your part- to- wards a reconciliation. There can be no peace so lo1g as Mr. Cavendish is present; he is the genius of discord, and seems to live in the flames that consume society." "Then we must get rid of him/' replied Mrs. Plantagenet. The love I have for my son demands that I banish from his presence the evil companions who have done so much to tarnish his good name in society; and, on this occasion, I shall not hesitate to discharge the obligations of a mother.' 'CHAPTER XXXIV. WHENN Lexington returned with the surgeon, he dismounted in the grove, and, giving his horse to the groom, turned to Cavendish, who, alone in his machinations, was leaning against one of the oaks, apparently unaffected by the bloody drama, which might have appalled the stoutest heart. "This has 'been a bloody piece of business, Mr. Cavendish'" said Lexington. "I know it," replied Cavendish, without moving his posi- tion, or even raising his eyes from the object on which they were fixed. "Is it possible," asked Lexington, " that any man who has a heart in his body would be so unfeeling as to stand by, un- moved, and see two fellow 'mortals shoot- down each other like   268        ROSE MLTON: dogs-? Where was your humanity, that it did not interpose to arrest this murderous action?" Was that my business?" inquired .Cavendish. "They came hither. to settle an affair of honor, and my duty wasto see it conducted with-equal justice to the parties." "What '!" exclaimed Lexington, with passionate emotion; "and do you dare to say that you acted a subordinate part in this terrible and bloody scene? Colonel York tells me that Plantagenet was willing for a reconciliation with Hamilton, but that you refused to negotiate, having the conduct of Plantage- net's affairs in your own hands as his second." His' proposition came too late," replied Cavendish. I have ever opposed, and ever shall oppose, the effort to negotiate after the parties have arrived on the ground. The time for that is before the acceptance of the challenge; but the accept. ance precludes- all attempts to negotiate, as far as the parties immediately interested are concerned. But, apart from this, there was nothing definite in the proposition of Colonel York, nor did he state that he was authorized by Mr. Hamilton to make the overture." "- But was not his introducing the subject at all, and at such a time, proof sufficient that he- was acting in accordance with the sentiments of his friend? Would he have compromised his own honor in suggesting a suspension-of hostilities at such a time? No F1 continued Lexington; " you do not state the real motives which actuated you in this disastrous affair.' You sought the blood of Hamilton, and I trust in God that it will rise up in judgment against you!" Look 'you, Lexington," replied Cavendish, angrily, are you disposed to act the afterpiece to this tragedy?" "I am disposed to denounce you as a villain!" replied Lex- ington; " nor would I stoop to meet on terms of equality the wretch who is guilty'of murder the most foul and felonious!" Cavendish uttered a fierce cry, and at a single bound was by the side of Lexington. He had 'drawn a dagger, and already   A ROMANCE.          209 its point was within an inch of Lexington's breast, when that gentleman seized the hand which held the dagger, preventing  him not only from using it, but also from transferring it to hi& other hand. "Villain!" exclaimed Lexington, "yield this dagger, or I skall pulverize you 'I "Never " said Cavendish, actually hissing between his clenched teeth. "I defy you to the death!" The struggle now commenced, but before Lexington could master his opponent, who was raging like some chafed beast of the wilderness, they were interrupted by Mr. Godolphin, who forced the combatants apart, and at the instant the dagger fell from the nerveless hand of Cavendish. Godolphin took it up, and threatened to stab Cavendish with it if he offered any more personal violence to Lexington. But, foiled as he was, Caven. dish did not seem by any means disposed to yield the contest, or shrink from the threat of Godolphin. He still kept his hawk eye on Lexington, and, had he perceived the slightest chance of success, he would have sprang on thatgentleman, and grappled with him for life or death. It was just at this juncture that Colonel York arrived at the scene, with a message to Cavendish, from Mrs. Plantagenet. "I will not obey it," he said, in a tone of wrathful indig- nation. "Am I a slave, to be bid hither and thither by any one who chooses to intrude into my affairs? Tell her I shan't comd!" "I'll tell Mrs. Plantagenet no such thing," replied Colonel York, "for it is my opinion that you sall come." "Indeed!" said Cavendish; "and what's the worth of your opinion? I don't value it a pin's point." "Perhaps you do not," replied Colonel York, "but as I have promised that you shall see Mrs. Plantagenet, there is no need of argument or discussion, for if you don't go volun- tarily, we will carry you forcibly. Choose the alternative!" "'ll choose no alternative," said Cavendish. "Neither you   270        ROSE MLTON: nor Mrs. Plantagenet have any right to intrude yourself on me, and as to the old woman's advice, she may keep it for some of her own kith, who are more in need of it than I am." Saying this, he sprung to his horse, vaulted into the saddle, and, with a bitter imprecation on the company, dashed wildly by those gigantic trees, like a storm cloud thundering agaiint the wind!  The gentlemen now returned to the room in which Hamil- ton, attended by Rose, was reposing on a couch, and shortly after Mrs. Plantagenet appeared, leading in her sop, who was still faint from the loss of blood. The unusual stir in the roomnaused Hamilton to open'his eyes, and as they rested on Rose, who was bathing his brow, a smile stole over his fea-. tures, and he tried to pronounce her name, but his voice was too feeble-,and he closed his eyes in despair. "Mr. Hamilton," said Mrs. Plantagenet, approaching the couch. But he made no reply. Rose bent over, and said in a low, but distinct voice:- "Mrs. Plantagenet is speaking to you." "Yes," he said, yes-Plantagenet." "It is his mother," continued Rose, "it is the mother of Mr. Plantagenet, who wishes to speak with you." He opened his eyes, as if wondering what this announce- ment could possibly mean, or if he was merely dreaming. "Mr. Hamilton/,' said Mrs. Plantagenet, "do I ahnoy you?" "No," said. he, "not in the least; but please give me a glass of cold water." Rose went for the water, brought it, and gave him as much as he would drink; and it revived himrso much, that in a little time he was able to raise himself on his hand, and observe the various persons in the room. '  L"My presence," said Mrs. Plailtagenet, observing his ob  vious astonishment, "my presence, and that of Miss Milton, O  .   A ROMANCE.          271 may Astonish you; but we came to prevent this terrible duel between my son and yourself, because we believed that you were incited. to it by those who desire the destruction of you both. I have conversed with my son, and have convinced him that Mr. Cavendish was really striving, to destroy him, at the instigation of a revengeful, unprincipled woman. I have long known her influence over Mr. Cavendish, but it was not until this morning, I learnt from Miss Milton that the influence of this vile creature had been used to prostrate the name, fame, credit, character, and conduct of my son. That she, and Mr. Cavendish, have had such unaccountable control over Richard, as to make him act ungraciously to a virtuous lady, and un- generously to yourself, I shall ever deplore with grief and regret; but he is now convinced that he has been the dupe of these scheming miscreants, and is here with me, ready to acknowledge his error, and beg your forgiveness for the past." When Mrs. 'Plantagenet had finished, Hamilton, with the assistance of Rose, attempted to rise to his feet, but failing, he was held up by Lexington, Godolphin, and Colonel York, Rose having retired a little distance from the group, with proper delicacy. "I verify every word and sentiment that my mother has uttered," observed Plantagenet, and it was not until my con- versation with her, in the adjoining room, that I became aware of the deep plot which has been laid for my destruction, and that of Miss Walsingham, to gratify the vindictive rage of Miss Huntly and Mr. Cavendish.. How this villainous scheme has been detected, it is unnecessary that I should now reveal. It is enough for me to know that I have been their victim, and that, acting under the impressions they instilled into my mind, I was guilty of bringing sorrow to the heart of a most virtuous lady, and of wounding the honor, no less than the person, of my friend." And, saying this, Plantagenet advanced, and took the hand of Hamilton in his own, though scarcely able to stand. But   272        Rose  ILoLT-ON: his mother still wound her arm around his person, and sup- pofted him, in her solicitude for his welfare. "Let us henceforth lead a new life, said Hamilton, with the chivalry of his noble nature, "for our friendship has been baptized in blood." And the reconciliationtwas consummated. When Mrs. Plantagenet had effected the reconciliation of these ancient friends, Miss Milton, retiring from the company, made a sign to Lexington that he should follow her. "-Mr. ;Lexington, said Rose, "I am going to ask a very great favor of you. Will you gratify me by returning to Afton?" "If, in doing so, I can be of any service to you, or to our mutual friend," replied Lexington, "I shall return most cheer- fully, and particularly as I know that I shall be the bearer of glad tidings to more than one petsonh." "* You are right in your conjecture," said Rose, "for it is to Miss Walsingham that I would particularly communicate the result of this extraordinary affair. If you will excuse mt for -a few moments, I shall write ny bulletin." "In the meantime," replied Lexington, "I'r prepare for the journey;" which he did so expeditiously, that when Rose gave hind the letter, he vaulted gayly into his saddle, and started for -Aftoh on a sweeping gallop. -In accordance with the recommendation of the surgeon, the party deemed it advisable to remain at "The Oaks" until the next day. Hamilton and Plantagenet now reclined- on the Isame- couch, side by side, and occasionally making some remark complimenta/y to each other; and if Plantagenet still felt a 'spark of apprehension-in his jealous nature, it was when Rose Would take the hand of Hamilton in her own, or bathe his brow with her snowy hand, or talk to him in those soothing accents that are nectar to the taste of a lover. These little attentions caused him to review his way of life for the last month, and it occurred to him that but fo' his impetuous jealousy he now might have had a fair, soft, snowy hand rubbing his temples,     *   A ROMANCE.          273 and smoothing his pillow, and makinga little paradise of sweets all around him; and he resolved again and again that, when he should be restored to health, he would make one fair, ho- nest overture for the little hand and heart of a young Periof the South, and, still thinking of the happiness that was in' store for him, he fell asleep, and dreamt of Peris .all the night long," as some of Tom XMoore's heroines did in the delightful "province of the sun." The rising sun of the next morning saw the party leave "The Oaks" for Afton. Hamilton and Plantagenet were placed side by side in the same vehicle, whilst Mrs. Plantage- net and Rose followed' in the old lady's carriage. Godolphin and Colonel York rode on horseback, and, moved to and fro as their presence was required. In this style they passed along those flat, sickly regions that seem to be the receptacle of all the vapors, malarias, endemics, and epidemics of the world, and had advanced a- considerable portion of the way, when a splendid equipage was seen in the distance, wending its way through the pine barrens, the reflections from its magnificent trappings glinting in the sunbeams. But, for all this show of splendor, there was a heart breaking with misery in that splen- did carriage-it was the heart of as true a mother as ever beat for the health, honor, and happiness of a beloved son. .As the two trains drew nearer, Godolphin galloped forward, suspect- ing what proved to be the truth, that Mrs. Hamilton had heard the dreadful disaster which had befallen her son, and was on her way to relieve his necessities. "Is Archibald alive?" she hastily inquired, as Godolphin rode to the side of the carriage, and, taking his hat off, bowed with deep respect. "He is," replied Godolphin; "and I am rejoiced to say that his wounds are not considered mortal by the surgeon." "Thank God!" said Mrs. Hamilton, as the big bright tears of gratitude and joy fell from her eyes. "Thank God! and I 24    274        ROsE MrIltON: shall ever bless you, my dear Mr. Godolphin, for having re- moved this weight of misery from my heart." The trains having met, Mrs. Hamilton descended from her carriage, Godolphin and Colonel York assisting her steps. She approached the vehicle, in which her son was reposing on' a bed, and took his. hand and kissed him, but did not utter one word. She did not even look at Plantagenet, nor-did she return the salutation of, Mrs. Plantagenet; nor from that day, that ]iour, has she ever spoken to the mother of the man who had sought to take the life of her darling boy. No induce- ment, no entreaty, no solicitation of her best and dearest friends, have ever changed her determination-the strong, . inflexible determination of a doting, devoted, and -doring mother. The clear, full, strong, deep tone of St. Michael's bell was sounding in. the city, and resounding in its suburbs, when the travellers arrived at Afton. They were met on Connor's Bridge ,by Lexington, who, after speaking a word to Rose, bid the driver of her carriage advance to the front, and convey his mistress to Mr. Walsingham's. He then ascertained the con- dition of Hamilton and Plantagenet, and, finding that they were receiving every possible attention, he turned his horse's head and galloped after Rose. She had already arrived at Walsingham's when Lexington rode up at a dashing gallop, and throwing himself from his foaming steed, handed her from the carriageto the steps. Here he paused. But Rose insisted that he should come in, as she desired to see him after her in- terview with Miss Walsingham. Rose flew up the stairs with the velocity of thought, and once more found'herself embracing that friend for whom she would have sacrificed her life, and for whose happiness she had re- cently passed through the most trying scene of her life. But what was her joy, her amazement, to find Fanny restored to reason, and making glad the hearts of her parents! But now, gentle readers, we must part; yes, brothers and I .   A'ROMANCE.           275 sisters, we must part, to meet again, I hope; for why should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to min'?" Oh, yes, we'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet, for auld lang syne." Is it necessary for me to state that, by the fostering influ-  ence of Rose, the beautiful Fanny was soon restored to health, and- made Plantagenet happy as Benedick, the married'man? And Rose, sweet Rose! the queen of Afton, did she defy the eloquence, the persuasive tongue of Hamilton, and remain a virgin. queen? Ah me! if St. Michael's records speak our annals true, there was once a fourteenth day of February--St. Valentine's Day, when birds and brides choose their mates- and, on that very day, Rose. Milton "acknowledged the soft impeachment," and vowed a boy, instead of a candle, to St. Valentine, in the name of Rose Hamilton. THE END.

They viomprise several courses of Lectures and Essays on Modern, and especially English History, and are full of interest.  As text-books in our colleges, they will have peculiar value. "A more creditable book, of the same bulk, has never issued from the American press. Rarely, indeed, in these days of literary charlatanism does the buyer of a book get so much pure wisdom of the head and heart as he will find compressed into th is eautiful -olume.- A fine thoughtfulness, discrmlinating judgment, and ae nial love for all that is good and beautiful, are qualities apparent on every page.'-- T. S.: Gazette.

' We know of no volume richer in classic lore than this, no one shrouded in so  deep andE thlling an interest 'for the calm courage evinced by the heroic Reed as1 he sunk gently down, on the llefated deck, into the fearful vortex of eternity, has scarcely a parallel in the annals of philosophic, Christian heroism."-America - The New Pastoral.
