* IT was a lovely evening in the latter portion
of the month of March.~-but that March was an
Italian one. The freshwindsof a Roman spring
caine across the intervening houses, laden with
the p~uxiies stolen from the choice exotics ani
rare shrubs flourishiog in the gardens of the pal.
ace inhabited by the wealthy banker, Torlogna.
A broad and beautiful amber covered the heaven
which was spread over the rooi~ of the Ete~na1
City, and, stole in with the reflex of the setting
sun, through the large and plated windows of
the Barberini (~afe4

"How, Guiio ~"
"You always have such capital ideas. But,
Bernardo, I am about to trust you with every-

said anything of my adventure; but you are a
good fellow, and an honest friend. I don't mind
telling you the whole of it, Bernardo."
"Well, well, GulIjo; explain yourself."
"You remember the Jew i"

"Him whore I saved, some weeks since, from
a broad-shouldered and thick-fisted scoundrel,
who was tormenting him in the street leading to
the Ghetto, and who would, apparently,-.but
that it i~as somewhat too early for such an ope-
ration,-have rejoiced in relieving him of his
purse, whish, you may ~nesunie, was tolerably
well lined with scudi."
"Yes, I remember him; but how on earth,
Guilio, could a Jew mix himself up with thy
fancies."
"Who said that it was a Jew, Bernardo2"
"You did."
"Nonsense, maui-it is a Jewess, or an angel,
of whom I am about to speak."
"A Jewess! Ho! ho 1" said Bernardo, "that
is a vary different affair."
"Ah I how your cheeks flush, and your brow
crimsons with pleasure. But, Bernardo, the first
discoverer of treasure c~ugh~o be Its lawful

"Arid s~ you shall be. ~oWever, let us have

"Well-4ake it. It is but 'a few days si~ice

while 'Come buy~ come and buy,' was shouted
in my ears from the one below it. However,
trade had the best of the day-religion only
came in second. The houses almost jostled
each other across the way-It would have been
no great difficulty for them to do so-in their
desire to find a purchaser. Around rae, at the
shop-windows, hung old clothes, umbrellas, paint-
ings, pots, tin pans, and worn out gowns. Have

"Never."
"I was going to say that it was a complete
'rug fair,' on a more extensive scale. Well, I
passed on among iron ware and tinsel, rugs and
dirt of every description, while my ears were half
stunned with "What will you buy I Excelleaza!
Look here! Excelleuza! This is very cheap!
What do you want? Excelleuza!' I could not
even pause to notice a pair of beautiful and
dark-eyed children who laughed te me from one
of the doors, without having a faded coat thrust
under my nose by a red-whiskered dealer in frip-

gression. We at last entered a long and low
room. This did not seem so much amiss; but
the girl was not there. Then the antique com-
modity who was with me poured forth a quantity
of gratitude in Eastern similes, which would
have charmed a poet. I did not care a quarterpf
a paolo fgr them. She will come at last, thought
I to myself. Still she came, not. Meanwhile,
the old Jew had started an idea, which you,
probably,-abominable spendthrift,-would have
hailed with rapture. I might occasionally want
money, yet have no great superabundance of it.
Consequently, I might ~e need to fly to com-
passionate souls, who ~nted their love to
me at varying percent thirty to fifty: So
he told me-it is a miracle, I admit, but you
have it fr6m him to whom the offer was made-
he would lend me money without taking any per-
centage at all."
"You accepted it; pulled out your port-fenilie,

"Not at all, caro inio 2" responded Guilio,
with a light laugh, "I did not want money."
"But I always did, and always do," said Ber-
nardo. "Give me the address, my friend, of the
benevolent old money-changer."
"He is no money.chauger, Beruardo; but let
me go on with my story. He next asked me to
taste his wine. I scarcely know what reply I
made him; but this I do know, that he went into
the adjoining room, and returned, accompanied
by one of the loveliest maidens I have ever look-
ed upon., The light of her beauty filled the
gloomy chamber, and almost blinded me. Blur
hair was as soft and as fair as the finest and
palest, thread spun by the silk worm; her blue
eyes swam and flashed like diamonds. But,
what are you smacking your lips at?" he in-
quired curiously.

I 'went two days after to borrow money, which I
had never wanted. I took~fifty scudi from old
Isaac, for a week, but she was not there. On the
third morning I returned to him, with his owns
money unchanged. He, Jew-like, not having so
entirely relied upon my boasted honesty, smiled,
and rubbed his hands with satisfaction. I went
into ecstasies with his wine of Cyprus, and he
produced me a second bottle; she, however, did
not appear; it was he who poured it out for me
with his meagre and trembling hand. I peered
into every cornet-, but she was not to be seen.
At length I was forced to leave him. As I went
down the steps, I looked up at the house, and
it seemed to me that a curtain, which hung
across the window where I had first seen her,
moved. A rose dropped at my feet, and I pick.
ed it up. 'Adieu, signora,' I exclaimed. All
was, however, still; not even a stray curl floated
from behind the green silk. And now, Berua-

'Amico ado! Be t~me as the Venus who led

Beruardo laughed.
"What is it that you would have me do ?" he
asked.
"Anything and everything."
' Pshaw! try and talk common sense."
"The Hebrew is a meet beautiful language; a

lifted the bottle, and filled his own glass.
"Smoke out your cigar, ~r order fresh ones;

pearance to-night."
As he said this, Dernardo emptied his glass,
leaned back in his chair and yawned; the truth
was, his companion had somewhat wearied him.

was in the Teatro Aliberto that a great
musical event was on that evening to come off,
'This was the dei.ut of a new vocalist. In the
North we can have no idea of the sensation pro-
yoked by such a chance in the warmer and more
ideal South. Italy is the land of song, and it
was in Italy that the new singing-bird was to
make her appearance. The amateurs of Rome
were, consequently, in a fever of anticipation;
nothing was talkedof but the approaching event;
was it to be a~uccess or a failure? The mana-
ger was no gr~at favorite, and it may easily,
therefore, be divined which way public opinion
tended. This, however, made no difference on
the attendance in the Aliberto; the theatre was
crammed to repletion. Above the audience, rose
the magnificent~ selling, with its hovering muses
floating; as it seemed, in an aznre sea, on which
the glorious sun appeared reflected in gushes of,
golden light; ~he curtain, with ell its tainted
01 ,and the gilt arabesques on the boxes,
were then entirely new. In each bf these last,
lights were burning, and illuminate the world
of loveliness which filled thehi. Della'rorre,
with his friend and two other gentlemen, were
sitting ina box, hear the stage, upon the second.
tier.

The overture commenced; and to this the au-
dience seemed to listen simply for the pleasure
of~ finding' fault wish the musicians. The un-
popularity of manager is generally visitedupon
the shoulders of the artists who areengaged, by
him.
"What an atrocious trombone is that," said
one.
"I think it actue  heavenly when I compare
it with those viii   trumpets," ejaculated
another.
"You mean the horns; they are, in truth,
execrable," said Della Torre.
"Nay! they are well enough when you only
rank them," muttered Guillo, "with the double
bases."
"Or the tenors!'
"Or the first violins. They are playing false,
now!" exclaimed Bernardo, pressing his handt
to his ears as he spoke.
No one was spared by these critics but the
drummer; he was in the regiment of 'Swiss
Guards, belonging to the Pope. Guillo Castelli
held the rank of captain in the same tegi.
ment.
At length the overture *as at ~n eid, and
the curtain rose. First came the choruswhich

public opinion had long since decided, was mis.
erable; then came the baritone, who really was
not so good asRonconi. lie was joined by the
tenor, who had a beautiful voice, and sung with
more than ordinary ability. He used it in the
style of Duprey, and chancing to fail that night
on the attempt to reach his highest note from
his chest, the unfortunate vocalist was hissed.
All this was to be laid on the back of the man-
ager. Fortunately, it was a sufficiently broad
one. Then the scene changed, and the debutante
made her appearance. She stood on the stage
before her judges-a delicate and graceful crea.
tare, infinitely beautiful and intellectual in the
character of her physiognomy. Long, fair hair
-we had almost grown poetical and said, like
woven sunbeams-was braided round her exqui-
site and gracefully-shapen brow. Her eye was
full of intense and rapt expression; her whole
face was such as Delaroche might have dreamed
of for one of his Madonnas. A loud outbreak
of stormy applause was suddenly heard; ~it wa~
to beauty, and beauty only, that the homage~wa.
tendered, for as yet she had not sung a note. A
crimson flush bathed her cheek and brow, and
colored her whole neck and bosom, as ulieliei&amp;

Here an impatient murmur rose from the par-
quette, which compelled him to silence. Then
her voice, which had been slowly gathering cour-
age through the recitative, burst into song, and
poured forth in a gush of melody, all of that
wondrous and pure emotion which, borne upon
the wings of sound, escapes from the ~hunian
breast. It was a burning passion which found'
utterance from her lips, and rose towards the
ceiling of the theatre as if to invoke di. muses,
whose painted eyes were turned upon the stage.
Then the last long and lingering note fell upon
the tura of the audience, and, as it did so, through
the whole of the house rang an universal ex-
clamation; her triumph was complete.
It will be unnecessary to follow 'her through
die rest of that evening; suffice it to say, that
her duet with the tenor was declared by the
Diario de Rome, which was published two days
after, to be "absolutely perfect and incompar-
able;" and that when the curtain fell, she bad
~l$e~re4 a triumph, and stamped her image upon
tlni peatinnate and impressible heart of the Ro-
man public.     ~
'1.Aww.! Aunti Wbellal I3ellissima Anna!
Anna! Anna incomparable 1,' were the cries
that rang for some minutes through the Aliberto.

He took her by the band, and led heruaresist-

entered it. Della Torre mounted on Its steps in

him, at an early age, into the Swiss Guards of
the Pope, where he now hdld the rankof captain,
and hiobrother had taken him by the hand and
introduced him into fashionable life. From the
first, he had an ample allowance. What was
wanting was made up at rare intervals-for Cas-
tern was no spendthrift according to the com-
mon acceptation of the term-by a word or, two
from the second to the banker, Torlogna Con-
sequently, his purse was never empty; while,
singularly enough, the spot upon his birth in no
wayinterfered with his standing in society. Sup-
ported by his family connections, that man must
have been very sure of his own position, who
would have ventured either to breathe a slur up-
on his character, or on account of his birth, t6
put a-slight upon the young officer.
As he opened the door of his chamber, a young
man, who was slight in person, and attired in the
extreme of fashion, looked up from the chair on
which he was sitting, and said:
"So you're here at last, Guilio i have wait-
ed for you for the last hour. Where have you
been "'
"My good Federigo," uttered the young offi-
Ca', as he bent forward and kissed the brow of his
-brother, for it was the Borghese who had been
waiting (~r him, "why did you not tell me that
youwlshedtoseeme4 You knowmetoo well
to dei~bt~ that I should have hastened home-
wards."             -
"How coulill have told you what, some four
hours earlier I did not know myself. I have
this evening been to the era, Guilio, and
am-
"Say it not! Borghese; thrice miserable
shall I find myself to have lost not only a friend,
but to lote my brother on the score of my unhap-
py passion."
Federigo Borghese stared upon Guilio as if he
could not comprehend him.
"What is the matter, my poor boy V' he said,
as he lifted his hand and swept back the cluster-
ing curls from his brother's bro~w. "I come here
simply to tell you that I had determined upon
bestowing my tediousness upon you for the rest
of the evening, when you declare that you are
'thrice miserable,' ai4 end by talking of 'your
unhappy passion.' What does it all mean,
Gullio1" -
The young man bent his brow upon his out.

"One of us. What the deuce, Guilio, if your
mother was nobody, a Borghese was beyond any
question your father. Look in the mirror; if the
relation be not apparent, tell me that I am a fool,
and forswear my friendship !"
As he aaid this he had caught Guiio round
the waist, and dragged him in front of a large
glass which was set into the walls of the apart-
ment. The light of a lamp which hung from
the ceiling fell upon theni. As the two broth-
ers gazed upon their reflection upon its polished
surface, a mutual and passionate feeling of broth-
erhood rushed over them; the same chestnut
hair swept in long and glossycurls around the
brow of either.; the same faint and silken mous-

S
tache curled around their upper lips; the same
dark, full and glowing eyes flashed from either
forehead. Almost alike in stature,-Borghese
was somewhat taller,-youth and beauty, they
gazed upon the mirror. Then they turned t9
each other; the prince opened his arms, and
Guile rushed into them.
"Is it agreed, my brother ~"
"Yes, my own Federigo! But Torlogna-"
"What of him I"
"Does he know bet I"
"If not, I will give him twenty-four hours
to make her acquaintance. Never fear. His
new title wants to be accredited; he will do any-
thing I ask him."

spread hands; flunghimself on a chairbeside his
brother, and burst juto a passionate fit of tears.
"Child 1', continued Federigo, as he drew away
one of Castelli's hands, "this is foolish. Tears
belong to woman; they are her only weapon4,
But when a soldier weeps, pshaw! Were ~ou
not my brother, I would tell you that you must
be a coward 1,'
"A coward !" answeWd Guilio, raising his
eyes, flashing with a sos~brejight through the
tears that still stood in them. "No! Pederigo,
you know that I am no coward. But, Federigo,
for the first timein my life-"
"Which l~s scarcely been so very long an ex-~

Guillo 2"
The question was sufficient to loosen the llp~
of the young C~astelli, and l~e poured forth the
whole of his brief love-dream into the ears ef his
brother.
"And is this alP!"
"Yes, all!"
"Well, Guillo, your habit of painting every
chance with the palette of a ~embrandt, has
misled you. I do not love Deil~ Torre, and
have always regretted that you should have
made him so' constantly your companion; but
how you could have dreamed that his chance ac-
quaintanceship with the -Brigni argued a passion
for her appears incomprehensible to me. Love
in modem timus is not the passion engendered -
by a moment, which poets and-"
"Mine was, Federigo."
The prince felt l~e was wrong. However, he
did not own this, but entered upon a learned
examination of the nature of love which, we
wilf not inflict upon our readers, begging them
to remember that th~ noble lecturerwas barely
twenty'two years of age, and this, the more es-
p~ially, as the termination of it was the euly
portion to which Guilio listened with interest.

shall introduce both of us, and we sb~all soonsee
whether the sigitora does not prefer thaadmira.

"But I, prince, am-"


Tim banker, Torlogna, had done all that the
young Borghese had required of him; he had
presented the two young men to the enchantress
who had crazed all musical Rome, to the intense
disgustof that portion of it which was immersed
in the politics of the papacy, and who kindly
consigned her and he~ adorers to the lowest pit
of purgatory, as the slightest possible reparation
for her popultirity and their madness.
If a group chanced to be standing before the
Laocoon, they were not lost in admiration of that
marvellous piece of sculp~ie-they were talking
of the new soprano; if you wandered in the
Coliseum at midnight, and stumuiled over two
friends, they were speaking of "labellaBrigni."
Did you stand in the nave of St. reter's during
the hours of morning muss, you might count
upon hearing her name ten times in a minute, at
the very least, from those who passed near you.
What wonder was it, that one of the most pious
of all the cardinals..-.member, though he ~ of
the Borghese famuly,-expresaed his a~tonish.
zuent that the cupola did not fall, and extinguish,
for the moment, her name and their admiration!
If the Brigni drove out, her carriage was sur-
rounded and followed by the whole of equestrian
So~ae. The young Colonnas would be on one
side; Borghese and his brother-when the latter
was not on duty-would be upon the other

Della Torre, and scores of the fashionable idlers
in the capital of modem Italy, would swell out
the cavalcade. If she went to purchase half a
yard of cambric, her cortege would give you the
idea of a regal procession. When she passed
her handkerchief over her brow, the beggar who
stood in the Piazza del Popolo murmured a bless-
ing. Once she threw a paolo to a poor cripple,
and the gold and silver that rained upon him
from the hands of her admirers, made him a
wealthy man.
Amongst them, however, were two who had
the envy of all the rest of young Rome; indeed,
we might have said three, for there were few
who had the chance of seeing the distinction
which she drew between the Borghese, with his
brother, and Bernardo Della Tone. To the
three, she was always "at home ;" but within
her apartments, a very clear and tangible dis-
tinction existed.
From the first moment that she knew Guilio,
she had liked him; and when he was presented
to her by Torlogna, she told him, with a winning
rankness, that there was no necessity for his pro.
curing an introduction, and that she should have
been glad to have welcomedhila as one towbom
she had been personally indebted. As yet, how-
ever, he had never been alone with her, and had
not found an opportunity to solve what was still

"Nay, Guilio, but 1you must! Think how
greatly you have been Indolited to the kindness
of the Borgh.ese family; to the old prince you
owe~verything; your very birth is .-"
~' One of his kindne~ses," broke out Castelli.
"Yes, truly owehim all; you'areright; yes,
you are right," and with a violent oath, he re-
leased himself from the arm of Dernardo, strode
along the battery, and entered the saloon at its
further end., As he did so, he did not hear the
mocking laugh which rang from the lips of his
late companion.
At the request of' the princess, the Brigni was
about to sing and the whole of the company in
those vast saloons were silent in expectation. A
skilful musician was seated at'the piano. Beside
him stood the soprano, and at no great distance
from her stood the young Borghese. In his
present temper, it appeared to Guilio, that the
whole expression of his~face breathed and spoke
of love. The musician touched tire keys and
played a brief jrelnde, after wl4~k her matchle.ss
voice broke into song. A change came over
the wayward spirit of the listener. As Guilio
listened to her, the suspicion which had pre-
viously agitated him, melted from his seul. He
remembered every word of kindness she had
breathed tohiui; he retraced the brotherly love
which had bound him to one whom he had so
lately faticied his rival; he denounced himself
for those s4splcions which wereawept away and
obliterated in the rush of that wondrous voice;
he had already drawn nearer to her. Then he
thought of the first time he' had ever seen her,
and called 'to mind the ~pressure of those tAper
fingers when he had first visited her under the
wing of Terlogita. Still he drew nearer; all
his jealousy had passed away; he was again
the willing slave of 'her beauty and her song.
Longere she bad concluded, he had beat his
'way, silently and almost timidly, towards her,
and found himself standing side by side with
his brother. Federigo nodded to him, and
smiled as (*uilio took his hand and pressed ii
,-4ha one was listening to her with the ear of a
'musician, the other heard her through the soui
of a lover.
As she concluded the aria which she had beer
singing, thers was a general and rQtureru

murmur of applause.. The Princess Borghese
rose, leaned forward, pnd pressed her lips to the
cheek of the Brigni.
"What would I not give," said the Banker
Torlogna, "to purchase such a kiss I"
"They may not be bought, old money.
broke" murmured~, Federigo, in his ear.
She had dropped her handkerchief. Gu.flio
stooped, picked it up,, and stepping forward,
presented it to her.
As she saw him, a slight flush colored her
cheek.
"I thank you, signor; I faneied~my friend had
deserted me, for I had not' seen you."
There was such an indescribable accent of
kindliness in her voice~ something which chid
hizu so aweetlyand unconsciously for his suspi-
cions, that Guilio colored beneath her glance.
"Signora," he replied' "I have been present
since you first entered the saloon."
A slight laugh caught'his ear; he felt that it
was the laugh of Della Torre.
"And what excuse can he offer me, prince I"
she said, turning to the younger Borghese, "for
putting upon me so gross a neglect as this ~"
," None," answered Pederigo, gazing upon
Castelli, "unless it were that possibly he feared
to intrude upon the time which was so pleasant.
ly occupied in listening to the praL~ea and
receiving the flatteries of others."
An hour afterwards, Guillo accompanied the
Brigni to her carriage. After handing her in
with the elderly lady, whose chaperonage pro-
tected her from malevolent rumors in the almost
universal laxity of Italian manners, she bent
forward'tohinl and said:
"Were it not for the reproaches I should
incur for dragging you away from your friends,
I might perhaps have asked you to accompany
us."
Scarcely had the words quitted her lips, than
the lover bounded into the carriage.
"Signora, I accept your invitation eve you
have well breathed it ;" and,,in the next instant,
the carriage was pullingg out of the 9ourt-yard of
the Borghese place, while he was sitting in it,
gazing upon those beautiful eyes which beamed
upon him from, the darkness that almost imine-
I diately surrounded them.

CHAPTER IV.
JEWISH CHAniry AED CIIIIISTIAN LOVE.

k

A DELICIOUS little supper was that which
awaited Castelli-for he found himself almost
alone, for the first time, in the society of her
whom he adored, as the old lady, true to her
functions as a chaperone "of necessity," ate and
drank, and scarcely uttered a single word.
A hundred questions which he longed to put
to the musical syren flashed across his mind;
but he was alike unable to muster the courage
either for framing or uttering them. "Were
Della Torre or Federigoin my place,"hethought,
"how soon would the queries be put to her which
are hovering on my tongue. Why is it that I
cannot sneak"' Then he would make up his
mind to do so; but ~ro sooner did he look up and
meet her eyes, than the words which he had just
framed seemed to die upon his tongue.
At length the supper was terminated, and
Anna laid her hand gently upon his arm; the
touch thrilled through him.
"You wish to ask mc something," she said.
"Why is it that you will not do so I"
"It is my doubt, signora, in how far your kind-
ness may pardon the impertinence of my quarry,
that prevents my giving it an utterance."
"If so, you must let me tell you what you

wish to know, ~without exposing you to the
chance of a reproof."
Castelli thanked her with his eyes.
"Your glances have so often questioned me,
that I feel I shall not be comfortable until you
know the whole of my little history. You have
imagined that I was a Jewess I"
The young Roman bowed in assent.
"It is not so; although I am indebted to a
Jew for that kindness which but few Christians
would have shown to an unfriended child. My
father was a scholar, and dwelt in Bologna,
where he occupied the chair of modern languages
in the university, The Rabbi Isaac is also a
singular master of the modern tongues. Chance

which are so common in the rest of Italy-reli.
gious prejudices. Their acquaintance ripened
into esteem; that esteem alternately became a
warm friendship. My father died while I was
no more than a mere child. He had not shown
that care over his worldly affairs which he had
expended upon the duties of his position. The
world knew nothing of the existence of my moth-
er and myself-how or why should it' trouble
about us ~"

"0, yes; my parent wrote to her only brother,
who was a married man; he sent her ten scudi."
"The abominable wretch!" ejaculated Guilio.
"But these ten scudi were accompanied by an
admirable letter of advice; that is to say, it
would have been admirable could she but have
followed it. She wept bitterly. I saw her weep,
and cried with her; then I jumped up and
clapped my hands together. My mother dried
her eyes, and looked at me.
"'Why do you not write to the man with the
black eyes and long beard, who came so often to
see my father'!"' I asked, impulsively.
"She knew whom I meant, thought a little,
and then did so. Five days after, Isaac arrived
in Bologna, lie sold off all the furniture, and
ls~ought us back with him to Rome. We now
lived in the Ghetto. It was four years after this.
that my mother died. After my tears had begun

more than a child,-Isaae spoke with me. He
told me that he considered me as his daughter,

a Christian, and he gave me to understand that

"It would consequently be necessary for me
to do something to ensure my future. I then
had a beautiful voice, whatever 'it may now be,

But he did more than to advise this. He placed
me under the care of a Christian lady,-she is
now sitting beside us,-~nd sent me for the fol-
lowing three years to Florence to study, under
the tuition of Ronconi. Twice a year be came

While she had continued speaking, he had'lia-
tened %o her with a strange- feelii~ of deligiit.
Qac bar in their union, which he. had hitherto
believed irremovable, gradually 4ias~lved be-
twe~n them; and as she finished, he felt that
thog already stood nearer to each other. She
w~ppf the same creed.as hin~self, a44 adQred in
the same temples, which were open for his own

worship. An irrepressible gladness enfolded
his soul; lie would then have opened his heart
to her, and had he doneso, how great a sorrow
would have been saved to them both. But,
bolt upright at his left hand, sat the Christian
dame, to whose supervision 'Isaac had entrusted
her, and the chill of her presence was upon both
of them, although Anna was as yet unconscious
of it, for she was as yet in heart no more than a
child-we, of course, mean an Italian child.
Castelli's mouth was consequently closed.
His eyes, however, fell upon her, and there
was a b~rning light in them which could not be
mistahett, and her's sank before them. He felt
that in that look he had told her all his love,
an4 that she had listened to him. What a pity
It was that he could not conquer his liver-like
shame-facedness, and tell her. all that was then
struggling within him.
Happiness generally comes ~o an end more
rapidly thiin sorrow. The old lady passed.iter
hand up 'to vermouth; it was unmistakable; she
was wearied with him. Yawning over theirlove,
she was pining for her bed. Guihio was young,
and obeyed the hint which she had given him.
As he took the band of Anna Brigni, and
pressed his lips upon it, he felt that his love had
mastered his whole soul. The door of the house
opened, and he went forth. As be stood upon
the steps leading into the street, the moonlight,
which 'had just risen and fell across the tops of
the houses, caught upon a crumpled lot of white
paper which was. lying before him. Without
knowing why he did so, he picked it up, and
bounded down the steps. This night he was off,
duty at'the Vaticau~ and had arranged to sleep
in hi~ old chamber at the Borghese palaces As
he passed th*nsgh the arch~ws.y leading into the
interior, the last carriages of the guests werede-
parting, and he mounted the broad staircase to
inquire for Federigo. He was not to be found;
but theold prince told him that he had:quitted
the saloon , some half hour since, in company
with the.younger of the Colonnas, and Bernardo
DellaTorre. Re then looked atGuilio witl~an
inquiring glance.
"But, my boy, what's it that has chan~eed to
you? Your cheelcs are flushed with pleasure,
and your eyes seem to be dancing with some su-
preme joy."
"Prince, it isuothing," answered GUi1IO Cas-
telli, s~ he colore~l deeply beneath his parent's

Even as he replied to the old man, his eyes fell

which filled him with so~thingapproachJng to

tioning him, Guillo had pressed his lips upon the
hand of the old nobleman. Immediately after,
he had quitted the saloon, and taking a light
from one of the domestics, ascended the staircase
leading to his chamber. For same moments, the
prince gazed after him, lost in~thought, and then
retired to his own apartment.

"And so I thought it best to leave hire to him-
self. When he has recovered from his present
moodiness, signora, you may certainly count
upon seeing him."
The Easter sunday had at length arrived, and
Anna had consented to accompany the Bankers
Torlogna to the cathedral of St.'Peter's, to see
the Pope bless the people. The young Borghese
had been invited to make a third in Torlogna's
carriage, and had readily agreed to do so. The
sable curtains which for five long weeks had
covered the pictures in every chapel an4 church
which seem to dot Rome, had now fallen, and
throughout the city, its Easter gladness. Jiad
awakened. The bells were ringing; cardinals
and ambassadors rolled abroad in their pompous
equipa~es; the carriages of the nobility and
wealthy foreigners, surrounded by the intermin-
able crowd of promenaders, filled the long and
narrow streets. From the castle of St. Angelo,
waved that great flag which bears upon its folds
the painted image of the Madonna and the papal
arms; music was playing in the Square of St.
Peter's; the fountains dashed their gigantic col-
umns of spray upwards to the heavens; on the
benches, beneath the colonnade, crowds of per-
sons were already sitting; and then from the
portals of St. Peter's, issue~l as huge a throng.
A sea of human beings filled the whole of that
vast space, heaving and swaying to and fro.
Peasants and boys climbed the pedestals of the
statues, in order to behold the Pope when he is-
sued from the church.
At length he was borne from its portals, sitting
in a magnificent chair, supportedd by six stalwort
priests, who were arrayed in robes of black silk,
and the two younger priests, who preceded them,
waved fans of colossal peacocks' tails on ashen
staves, ornamented with silver. Vessels of in-
cense swung before him; cardinals and bishops
surrounded him, and the Swiss Guards filed after
them, c~losing the procession.
"H~e is very pale," said the Brigni, whose lorg-
non was bent-so it seemed, at least, to Torlogna
-upon the Pope.
The Borghese caught her meaning more rap-
idly, for his glass soon discovered Guilio, and
enabled him to peruse the features of his brother.
"Well," said the banker, "itis natural enough;
the old man-I mean his Holiness-must be very
weary."
Neither of them replied to him.

SOPRANO.                             25
Scarcely had the ps~ieossion, emerged from the
doors of the church, than the choirs, stationed
around it, received it 'with a butst of triumph.
The Pope was horrt~ u~ tha hiftysteps which
lead to the gallery in front of the cathedral. Here
he advanced, encircled by the cardinals, and all
present dropped upon their knees. Women and
children, priests and peasants, the soldiers, the
nobles, and the populace bent before him; only
the Protestant stranger, whom curiosity had
drawn there, stood erect; and there in the midst
of the universal silence which had fallen upon
that vast multitude, the aged priest spread out
his hands and blessed them. Then two papers
fluttered down from the balcony; one contained
a forgiveness of sins to the faithful, and the other
was a written curse upon the enemies of the
Church; the populace who were immediately be-
neath the gallery, contended for the smallest
scrap of them.
Once more the hells of all the churches rang,
and the crowd had risen from their knees. Mu-
sic mingled itself in the general joy; the Pope
retired from the gallery, and all was over.
As they drove back with Torlogna,-for they
were to pass the day at the banker's mansion,
-the ~rigiil and Federigo were both silent; the
pale face and wan cheeks of Guilio seemed to /
chase every gentler and happier thought from
them. For the first time they wished to be
alone, together, and Dorghese reproached him.-
self for not having insisted upon Castelli's visit-
ing the signora. She had wondered at his ab-
sence, and still more did she marvel at the
change which had come over him. Scarcelyinore
than a week since, she had seen the color of
youth and health on his cheeks; now this was
blotted out, and he seemed whitened with suffer-
ing. His brow had been knit; not a muscle of
his face had played with the emotions ~of joy and
love which had formerly made it a picture she
could not tire of gazing on. When he had
kneeled to receive the papal blessing, the action
was rather that of a machine, representing life,
than a human being.
The day gradually wore through. 2~he dinner
was unexceptionable; the wine excellent, and the
company well chosen. This of course had its
effect, and scarcely was it more than half over,
era the Eorghese recovered his spirits. He
laughed and jested with the Brigni, and partially
succeeded in dispelling her uneasiness. Once
she found en opportunity of questioning him,
and instantly seized upon it. As he listened to

was the evening of the illumination of St.
Peter's. Who that has once gazed upon that
facade of fire can ever forget it? The whole of
that gigantic dome is traced in a burning Qutirne
upon the blue heavens. It actually quivers with
light, and when the fiery structure-for so it
seems-is seen from the bridge of St. Augelo,
reflected in the yellow Tiber, it strikes upon the
eye as a huge transparency; so mighty snd im-
posing in its outlines that it would almost appear
the work of some supernatural and fairy hand.
And then, when the ~ignal is given for the
change, and the thousands of men stationed on
its roof touch the pitch garlands hanging around
them with flame, the enormous structure be-
comes a blaring temple, towering over the impe-
rial city which lies and breathes around it.
"Only think," said Anna, "of the danger en-
countered by the miserable individual who hin-
dIes the topmost light on the erpas of~he cupola."
"With what pride he msz~t gaze on the blazing
sea of light beneath him,~'jeplied Fede~igo.
"J3esides thinking very sgreeably of the twen-
ty scudi which pay him for the danger, and are
theuprobably, in his breeches' pocket," added
the banker.
After fasting their eyes on the scene before
them, it was proposed that they should drive up
the~onte Pinejo, and gaze upon it from a great-
er distance. So the vetturi,~received his orders,
and the carriage, after a drive of half an hour,
drew up at the little inn on the side of the hill.
From this point, the view of the cupola was
glorious; it seemed hewn from a burning sun.

Federigo hung pver the signora; for that mo-
ment, arched in by that singular scene, uppor-
alleled for its splendor in the world, it ~ees~ied
as if the influence of its magic beauty liq4 melted
him to love. ,He whispered to her of it~ loveli-
ness; he talked to her of its wonders; and her
lips replied ~o him ,in a tremulous accent, ~s if
she, too,,had warmed to him under theruagic
power of the ~c~ene. As for the bank9r-why,
he was aniap of nsiddle age,-he had ye~ly en-
joyed itt.t~om his boyhood. He leaned from the
carnage, and beckoned to a man who was stand-
ing nearit. The shadQw5 of the poplars before
the inn streau~ed across the spot where he stood.
In the darkness~ which rendered it impossible to
trace his features, Tprlogna ispagined tli~t he
was a servant of the $pn.
"Bring me a glass of water."
The man did not stir.
"Do you not hear me I" 'ejaculated Torlogna.
Federigo turned to him, and said:
"I will procure you and the signora some re-
freshment ;" and without remaining to hear the
banker's. disclaimer of giving him so snuck
trouble, he leaped from the carriage and passed
into the little ipn.
The man followed him, and in another mo-
ment, voices were heard from the interior of the
house. They grew louder, and the Brigni recog-
nized the accents of Castelli. She caught hold
of Toriogna's wrist.
"Do you hear?"
"What ~"
"That is the voice of the brother of Bor-
ghese I"
As she said this, a sudden flash illu~inated
the passage *hich led intothe interior of the hos-
telry, and as it did so, a pistol-shot. rang on the
spot. Anna Brigni bounded like a startled fawn
from the carriage, and rushed into the interior of
the inn.

"Mad boy !-listen to inc I"
"Federigo, I must die I"
"You are dreaming, Guilio."
"Slay me, my brother I-or must I kill uiiyself

Federigo started back in horror; but the li&amp;nd
of Guillo was still faMened upon his wrist, and
he was unable to flee from the presence of the
maddened boy. Panting and scared by the
glowing passion of that monotonous volta, he
was forced to listen to him.
"Take the pistol and consummate my mur-

night; now you shall slay me I"
"Guilio I my brother Guilio, let me speak I"
"I will not !-t.ake it !" And still grasping
the wrist of his brother, he extended the weapon
to him which he had plucked from the bosom of
his dress, without a change, either in his hoarse,
bitter voice, or in the death-like expression of his
face.
"Why should I, Guilio?"
"Rave I not told you? Take it."

Wunar Federigo had passed into the inn, he
had soon found the waiter, and had directed him
to bring some refreshments. He then returned
through the narrow passage, which was only lit
by ai~ oil lamp hanging at its further end, when
he saw a figure standing before him. It was that
of his brother. A short cloak, which was flung
hack from his shoulders, hung around him. It
was black, and even in that vague and gloomy
light formed a strong contrast with the deathly
pallor of his countenance. The expression of
his features was fixed, and he stood there like a
shadow returned from that Hades which the old
Romans peopled with the dead. For the mo-
meat, Federigo recoiled, or would ha~e done so,
had not Guiio thrust forth his hand, almost me-
chanically~ and grasped him by the wrist. His
eyes were glaring from the immobility of the
rest of his countenance with the delirium of
fever.
"Federigo 1"
His voice was so hollow and so unmodulated,
that it struck on the ears of his brother like the
voice of a dead man.
"You have strewn my life with the ashes of
bitterness and misery, Federigo! Yet had I re-
solved to permit it all to pass-to forgive you,
and to die! Now that I have seen you bending

"A letter!"
"Ay."
"It is false !"
"Of course! of course! Take it."
"Come with me, Guilio." And as he said this,
he laid his hand upon the shoulder of his brother.
"She shall convince you that you have indeed
been dreaming."
Guilio pushed him rudely hack, but Federigo
was determined to lead him to the carriage.
There was a short, sharp struggle, and then a
report was heard. For a moment the confined
passage was filled with smoke, and a cry of pain
rung on the sti~lnesa of the night. The smoke
cleared gradually away, as Federigo staggered
back and sunk upon the ground.
Castelli reeled back against the wall. For a
moment he was blinded mid deafes~ed by the an-
guish resulting from that fearful chance. Then
he heard the voices of the people of the house
around him, and a wild exclamation of:
"Santa Maria !-what is this ~"
It was the voice of the Brigni.
"Federigo I" he shouted in despair, and would
have cast himself uponthe body; hut Anna was
already upon her knees beside it, endeavoring to'
afaunch the blood that welled from the wound in
his breast. She lifted her head, and fastened a
steady look upon (luillo's convulsed and terror-
stricken countenance.
"Unhappy man I" she murmured, and then
she again looked down, and the tears from her
eyes rained upon the senseless bosom of Federigo
Borghese.

Torlogna caught the hands of the young Cas
telli, and bade him save himself.
"I am innocent I" he cried aloud. "Tell
them, Federigo, that I am innocent of this I"
He waited a moment; he gazed passionately
upon the face of his brother; but no sign of con-
sciousness woke on the countenance of the
wounded man.
"I would have slain myself!" he continued;
"but Heaven knows that I dreamed not of taking
thy life ,We both loved thee, signora. I de.
spared and wished only to die I"
She wrung her hands as she listened to him.
"Wretch that I am, to cause thee even one
tear! And now thou wilt shed many; but too
many I"
"Away I" she stammered, making a rapid
gesture with her hands. He fancied that it was
to forbid his approaching her.
"Yes, you must fly I" muttered Torlogna, as
he dragged him towards the door of the little inn.
"Anna, farewell I"
As he said this, she bent her head over the
countenance of theapparently dying man, while
her light and golden tresses, loosened in that
moment of terror and agitation, swept her cheek.
"Here are the gens d'armes I,, was jhoizted
from the front of the hostelry, as Torlogna
pushed him from the doorway.
"She loves him. Yes; she loves him I,' was
the stormy thought that swept through the brain
of Guilio, as he leapt over the hedges, crushed
through the tangled underwood, and climbed
over the stone walls that bounded the vineyards
with which the side of the Monte Pincio is cov-
ered. The light from the fiery cupola of St.
Peter's streamed over the country, like a second
and morebleging day, as he fled, like amadman,
from the spot on which he had steeped his hands
in a brother's blood.

Wa have now te retrace our steps. After
Torlogns and the Brigni had borne the wounded
Federigo to the palace of the Borghese in the
banker's carriage, and he had conducted her
home, she for the first time, in the secrecy of
her own chamber, gave way to her anguish,
which was not wholly unmingled with joy. It
must be remembered that until this evening she
had, very naturally, doubted the love of the
yoting Castelli for her. His constant avoidance
of her presence was unmistakable. How was it
possible for her to suppose that lie had mistaken
the attentions of the young Borghese to her for
a love with which he doubted his own power to
control I Now, all this was clear; but suppos-
ing that Federigo should die-Guiio would have
the weight of a brother's death upon his con-
science; he would slay himself, or if not he
would fly from the sunny shores of his own Italy
to roam as a wanderer wherever his chiding
soul might prompt him. What should she do I
She wrung her hands with anguish. And yet he
loved her; and as the Italian thought of this,
her face brightened. She fell upon her knees,
and the mingled prayers of her joy and sorrow
climbed the steps of heaven, and smiled and
wept before the throne of the Eternal Father.
The next day Torlogna called on her. He
had sent early to the ]3orghese palace, and had

received front the old prince a favorable account
of the young Borghese. The wound wac by no
means a dangerous one--so, at least, said the
physician. In less thafl~two weeks it was pro-
bable that he might again be able to see his
friends. They dared hope it.
"And poor Guilio 5" asked the Brigni, as
soon as he had paused.
Torlogna looked inquisitively at her, and she
flushed slightly as he did so.
"In accordance with the request of Federigo
himself, the prince will not pursue him," he con-
tinned. "He is a noble young man.
"He is," answered the Signora Anna.
The Roman banker had been thinking of
Federigo Borghese when he said this; but the
Italian vocalist had thought of Guillo Castelli
when she answered him.
"Nay, when he has perfectly recovered,! am
told that thu prince, urged by the prayers of
Federigo, has promised not to pursue him. The
Princess Borghese is ~' more bitter; but then
she is a woman; of course, you know that is
very natural."

Anna Brigni looked at him with astonishment.
The change in his manner was so ~omplete.
But a moment before his language had seemed
to burn with youth and passion; now it was as
cold and glacial as the ice in the higher Alps.
"You do not choose me to address you in
the language of love. Well, it shall be so. You

stretched out her hand to the little ivory handled

rose and pushed it towards her.
She sank backing her chair, and her eyes were
fixed upon his. He laughed bitterly, and the

congeal the blood in her veins; she could do
nothing but listen to him.
"I saw and knew that you loved Guillo Cuss-

IT was somewhat late in the evening of the
day succeeding that on which the lieutenant of
Guiseppe Scarlatti had seen Federigo, that three
figures might have been observed approaching
the Borghese palace. The most remarkable of
these was Andrea himself. His vigorous make,
and the whole style of his tread; his heavy
swing to and fro as he stepped on, and the un-
usual style ~f his dress, might have convinced
the chance looker-on that he was by no means
of the straighter-laced denizens of that part of
the world governed by the successors of St.
Peter. His two companions were n young man,
apparently, for the broad rim of his hat was
slouched over his face, dressed in a short and
wide gray capote, and an elderly woman bent
almost double with age. She had hold of the
arm of the young man, and had, apparently,
much difficulty in supporting herself by means
of a short stick, on which she bent heavily.
"Ha! ha !" chuckled the old woman, half to
herself, though partially addressing her compan-
ion. "What a fool Andrea is !-ha! ha! ha!
Some day or other when he enters Rome in this
way-he! he!-they will pounce upon him; and
although he is a Samson, he will be sent to the
galleys."
They had now arrived at the Borghese palace,
and had entered the court-yard before the house,

when a domestic in the livery of the family ad-
vanced towards them.
"Who are you wanting, my good people l"
he asked.
"Tell him, Andrea," said the old woman.
"We wish to speak withllPrincipeFederigo/'
"He is expecting you; follow ~
The servant ascended the steps of the man-
sion, passed the porter who was sitting within
the hall, and turned to the left and ascended a
winding staircase. They- followed 14; and
Andrea's step as he 4id so, resounded through
the hail.
"Where it is," said the porter, wheezing
through the fat of his capacious paunch, to get
out the words, "that I have seen that scoun-
drel, it would be impossible for me to say; but
some day- or other I shall expect to hear of his
presence in the galleys."
It was, to say the least of it, somewhat strange
that the old woman and the double-chinned por-
ter should have so singularly coincided in their
opinions regarding the ultimate fate of Andrea.
Let us add, as we may never again have the op-
portunity of doing so, that they were very cur-
rect in their anticipations respecting it.
In the meantime, the three individuals whom
we have accompanied, had arrived at the ante-

so poor that he grew quarrelsome, and having
some skill with the small-sword, wounded a
Neapolitan nobleman in a brawl that took place
in a gambling house. Nothing more was heard
of him for three years. About that time, the
nobleman he had wounded was travelling to-
wards Rome. It was almost nightfall; but he
was so near the gretr city that he haddetermined
on not waiting until the following morning at the
tarrying-place which he bad just quitted. His
carriage was stopped, the traces cut, and a pistol
held to his head. Re got out and was cars-led
into the mountains. Five thousand scudi were
asked for his ransom, and they were paid. The
nobleman entered Rome, and a week afterwards
it was heard throughout central and southern
Italy that the broken-down gambler and extin-
guished tenor was playing the part of Fra Di-
avolo on a large scale in the Roman Campagna.
Let us now return to the thread of our story.
Guiseppe had smiled politely while Federigo
was laughing; but no sooner had he terminated
than he pointed to the table and requested Fede-
rigo to rectify his mistake.
"Let me assure you it is none," said the Bor-
ghese.
"You will excuse me, prince; but it is so,"
responded the polite brigand, with a low bow.
"But supposing that there was another service
which, did you choose to undertake it, you could
render me ?"
"'Yoi~ see," muttered Andrea.
"0, in that vase," answered Scarlatti, "I pre-
sume that I might gratify you."
"Well, there is."
"Andrea, you can put that check in your
pocket," said Scarlatti. Then he looked at Fed-
erigo. "You pay handsomely, prince. One
thousand scudi as an earnest-and-"
He paused.
"Two thousand more if you accomplish that
which I wish I"
"You see how a matter of business is arranged
between two gentlemen) Andrea I" observed the
captain, in the tone of a patron. Then he turned
to the Borghese. "I accept the proposition!
Now, what is it?"
"Do you know the Signor Beruardo Della
Torre ?"
Guiseppe Scarlatti stArted, and turned roand
with a fierce look at Andrea; but the look of
astonishment visible~ in Andrea's face, at once
re-assured him.
"I see you do."

"I have heard of him," said the brigand.
"You were in Rome the nighPbefore last. In
the second street from the Aliberro you stopped
a carriage. Della Torre was with you; he en-
tered it, and you accompanied almost as far as
the first post-house on the southern road that car-
riage. There Della Torre and his unwilling
companions dismounted-for there were two.
The carriage returned to the first hostelry and
baited there; it then returned to the city."
Scarlatti stared at the young prince as he was
speaking.
"The cursed vetturino ought to have his throat'
cat from one ear to the other !" muttered An-
drea.
Guilic laid his hand upon his brother's arm.
"Who were in that carriage I" he asked.
"You shall know all, Guillo-it belonged to
the Brigni 1"
"Accursed devil 3"
"Signor Scarlatti," said the princes "if you

to do so, I pledge my honor to root out your nest

zecchin were to be spent upon the attempt 3"
Scarlatti laughed bitterly.
"Your gloves must be thick and your mask
stout, when you try to do so! However-come
here, Andrea."
He arose and walked to the window, while his
lieutenant followed him.
"And is this all true I" asked Castelli.
And as his words escaped from him, his face
was burning with the ~a~e that drowned his soul.
"It is; the vetturino is now in this house.

IT was with no little difficulty that Federigo
prevailed npon their father to pardon Guilio.
At first the old prince had absolutely refused to
see him, and he even reproached Federigo for
having permitted him to enter the palace. The
younger Borghese, however, noticed that his pa-.
rent did not chide him for having ransomed Gui-
lio from the band of Scarlatti.
" He is my son," replied the old man to the
arguments of Federigo ; "but ought not that
very acknowledgement of the rights he has upon
my love, to have hindered him from staining
his hands with a brother's blood 2"
"It was but an accident-a mistake-an un-
fortunate chance, my father. Guilio loves me."
"An accident ! Yes, you have told me be-
fore it was an accident. How can I believe
you 2" -
"You shall, and you must," ~replied the
younger Borghese, as he drew aside the curtains,.
of the bed and, showed the old prince his son.
"See, he is here, my father ! Dare you add to
the wrong which you have already done him-
the greater one, because it strikes and bruises
the very heart,-my father, of denying him your
blessing 1,' And as he said this, he drew Cas-
telli nearer to his parent.
Tor a moment the aged prince hesitated ; he
looked from one-to the other ; he traced his own

youthful presence in each of those gallant boys,
and all the father's blood stirred within his bo-
som; he gazed upon the face of Guilio, and as -
he did so, fancy brought back her whom he had
wronged. Tears blinded the eyes of the .old
man as he opened his arms to him.
. " My son !" And Guilio was once more re-
ceived into the family of the Borghese.
That night, when Federigo and his brother
were once more alone, Castelli turned to him
after a long silence which neither of them had
been willing to'break.
" Tell me," said the young man, "tell me,
my brother, why is it that you are so muh no-
bler than I am 2"
Federigo looked at him.
" What are you dreaming of now, Guilio l,"
'" It is no dream, Federigo !-it is but the sim-

.again met you in my momentary delirium I
wounded you and fled. While, on the other
hand, Federigo, it is to you, and you alone, I
owe the summons which has called me back and
reconciled me to the only one, save yourself

and Anna Blrigni, who has ever shown me affec-
tion." '
" And, my brother, shall I tell you what the
reason of this is ?"
" Yes." .
"Simply, my poor boy, that you are in love,
while I am not ; and in truth, if this indeed be
love, I doubt much whether I ever have been or
ever shall be. But I feel wearied, Guilio, and
have need of rest." He rose from the chair on
which he was sitting, us he said this. " Will
you summon Giorgio 2"
"Nay, to-night, Flederigo, let me supply the
place of your servant."
The younger Borghese smiled as he accepted
his brother's assistance, and retired to rest. Gui-
lio sat beside the bed as Federigo slept. A
thousand strange and bitter thoughts were whirl-.
ing through his brain-yet, singular as it was,
his love seemed at peace. He was now convinced
that the Brigni did not love Federigo-or, rather,
he was confident that Federigo did not love her
--and this, comforted him. That Bernardo
would attempt-now that he had her so entirely
in his power-every means to win her, he did
not doubt ; but his -soul whispered to him that
.she eared not for Della Torre. " She loves him
not," he muttered, "andshe never will and never

can love him.- Did she do so, I, myself, could
forgive her for throwing her affections away
upon one from whom she could expect no re-
turn." Yet, as Guilio said this, the leaven of
hatred arose within him. He clenched his hand,
and rising to his feet, strode across the cham-
ber ; he approached one of the lofty windows,
and drew the curtain from before it, and the
broad moonlight poured in a checkered stream
along the marble floor, and as the cold yet bril-
liant beam fell upon him, it stilled and calmed
his heart ; he leaned upon the balustrade that
protected the window from the- garden, and as
he felt the cold wind of night sweeping across
his brow, he leaned upon his hands and for the
first time iu many days he wept ; but the tears
that he shed were not tears of bitterness and
sorrow-they were rather the drops that flow
from the heart when it is relieved from the
weight of anguish and despair which has so long
been oppressing it ; he felt within his soul that
his sorrow had passed away from him. Two
weeks since, and he felt that he had been no
more than a mere boy ; but a new birth had
taken place within him; his past lifeggas now
blotted out-the boy was dead, and Ill is place
stood the conscious, bold and daring man.

CHAPTER XII.
THE USE OF A LIEUTENANT-.

ATlesgth the evening of the day following
had arrived, and- Guilio-for whom Borghese's
influence with the Pope had procured a ready
pardon-.-quitted the side of his brother. Leave
of absence had been granted him for a week,
and in that time he hoped again to see her.
"Farewell, Federigo I" he'had said. " I would
not--nay, you know that Icould not-leave you,
but--"'                            '
" That she is in peril. Go, mio caro I"
As Guilio pressed the hand of his brother, he
murmured a blessing on him; the instant after-
wards he was gone. '
The evening service was chanting in the Sis-.
tine Chapel as he entered it, and knelt in that
wondrous place of. prayer. The mighty sibyls
and glorious prophets of Michael Angelo stood
out upon the walls and ceilings ; they seemed in
the partial gloom that pervaded it, even grander
and more august than they had ever before ap-
peared to him. The magnificent processions,
the beautiful groups of angels, the bold fore-
shortenings, the determinate force with which
each figure sbems to breathe upon the plaster,
were revealed in the awe and grandeur of the
gathering gloom to his adoring soul. Often had
he stood there, hut never before had this start-
ling sublimity seemed so wonderful to him as it
41id now to that kneeling man. Before him, on

the background of the chapel, was the greatest
painting that dead or living artist has ever given.
Like a marvellous jewel, set in that giant-world
of art, stood out Angelo's Last Judgment. Christ
stood upon the clouds, while from his mother,
and the apostles gathered around him, rises the
passionate prayer of the painter for the whole
human race. The dead burst from the heavy
gravestones under which they have for ages
lain ; blessed spirits break from their cerements,
and float upwards on the wings of their adora-
tion, whilst beneath then yawns the bottomless
abyss to seize its miserable victims. Despairing,
they strike their brow with their clenched hands
as they sink into its depths. With a strong and
earnest hand has Angelo limaned in color that
which Dante saw and sung. The most wondrous
painter that the world has yet produced there
asserts his right to stand in the might of his far-
reaching spirit beside the greatest poet to whose
breath man has ever listened-for Dante is the
Isaiah of the lyre,.
When Guilio at length arose, he felt that he
was stronger The gorgeous inspiration had
passed within him, and as he left the chapel,
the gathering gloom of twilight fell around him,
calm in the midst of that hope which was to
him a prophecy. He mounted his horse, teased
a coin to the boy who hel ,alloped down

I

Rome.- Two hours afterwards he had reached
the spot which Scarlatti had appointed.for their
meeting. There was the Tiber, darkened by the,
night ; the huge tomb, with its disjointed and'
crumbling .masonry ; the low and shiny bank
near it ; and around it, darkness and gloom, for
aot yet had the moon arisen.
Castelli dismounted. The bandit had not yet
arrived. After throwing the bridle of his horse
around the branch of an arbutus that had rooted
itself between two of the fragments of fallen
stone, he felt his way into the interior of the
tomb. The burnt out brands of a fire, now nearly
de ad, were smouldering upon the hearth, and by
their still red light the whole interior of the
tomb was visible. It was, what in the preceding
ages might -have been a family burging-place.
The low and narrow chamber in which he for the
seconadime stood, was surrounded by two rows
of small niches, and some were still covered over
with mosaic, defaced, yet still. exquisitely beau-.
tiful. From others, this covering was rudely
broken away, whether for the sake of convenience
,by its chance occupants or in the search for trea-
sure, it would be impossible to say ; neverthe-
less, they were very certainly in use now--for as
Gulio cast his eyes upon them, he saw sundry
bottles in one; in another was a, quarter of a
sheep, recently killed, as it would appear ; and
over the edge of a third, hung one of the com-
mon sheep-skin coats worn by the Roman peas-.
atry. The atmosphere Within the tomb was al-.
most stifling, and he again merged into the air.
As he did so,.the tramp of horses was heard.
It paused almost close to him; he heard the
click of a pistol-lock, and almost immediately
after, a voice cried out :
" Who's there ? Speak, or I fire ?"
Guilio recognized the voice of Scarlatti.
" It is l1-Guilio Castelli I" was his immediate
answer$
"You are punctual, signor, aud i am not,"
said Guiseppe. " May I crave your pardon ?"
As the brigand said this, Guilio heard the un-.
mistakeable grin of Andrea. The rascal seemed
to enjoy the unimpeachable politeness of his
captain, who had, immediately after speaking,
dismounted from .his steed. Scarlatti then ap-
proached Guilio, and laid his hand upon the arm
of the young man.
" Come with me into the old bone-house,"
he said. "I have mn eh to say to you."
He then fe          a~to the interior of the

tomb, and thrusting his hand into the interior
of one of the niches, to which we have before
alluded, he dragged out three or four pieces of
dry pine, which he placed upon the smouldering
embers before referred to. In a brief space, they
burst into a blaze which illuminated the whold of
that strange chamber ?
"Do you yet know where she is ?" demanded
Castelli,
" Wait a moment, signor. All in good time,"
answered the brigand, as he thrust' his hand into
the niche in which the quarter of a sheep was
lying, ands drew from it a huge pasty. '"I have
just ridden twenty-seven miles, and have touched
nothing since mid-day. You must have patience
with a half starved man 1"
Guilio fiung himself upon the groupd, impa-
tiently, as Scarlatti drew a bottle end cup froln
the other niche, and pushed them towards him.
S"Will you drink, signor ?" he asked.
Without answering him, Guilio took the cup
and filled it. As for Scarlatti he was lost-in the
enjoyment of his senses.
The form of Andrea stood in the doorway of
the tomb.
"May I not enter, captain ?" he almost
groaned, as he witnessed the huge inroads which
were being made upon the contents of the pie.
"No !" answered the brigand; "I am en-
ga d."
"But I am hungryy"
"You will have to cook your supper," an-
swered the'-chief, pointing with one hand to the
mutton, as his other was still engaged in per-
forming the duties of a fork.
Andrea retired with a groan.
" He! he ! he 1" laughed Scalratti, as he com-
pleted his repast, and pushed the large platter,
which was thoroughly empty, from him; "that
fellow will never learn any respect for my dig-
nityl"
He stretched out his hand to the cup, which
must have held move than a pint, filled it, and
emptied it at 'a single draught. Re then took
out a cigar, lit it, and extended another to Cas-
telli.
"Will the signor not smoke ?" he said, as he
did so.
" I thank you, not now," replied the young
Roman.
" Well, then, Let us to business."
Guilio sat up opposite Scarlatti, who was lean-
lug upon his elbow, in a half-recumbent posi-
tion, est the other side of the fire. It was a

strange scene, and might have afforded scope
for a clever artist to embody it. The glimmering
flame from the burning fire fell fitfully and bril-
liantly upon the low roof of the tomb. Here it
caught upo'n the flashing colors of a piece of
mosaic that was half concealed by the shadow
thrown front the body of the bandit, which was
traced upon the wall in gigantic proportions.
There it was lost in the darkness of one of the
broken cavities, eazl here again it streamed
through the doorway of the sepulchre uron the
fallen stones, and the branches of the straggling
shrubs waich grew without it.
The face of Guiseppe Scarlatti, himself, caught
the light more strongly upon its outlines than
did any other object, and its singular and almost
grotesque character might have induced one to
believe that it was the carved image of an old
faun, were it not for the roguish and malicious
twinkle of the eye which played and flashed al-
most incessantly, while the rest of the features
were perfectly motionless.
"I have not discovered where she is."
"No !" cried Guillo, as he started to his feet;
"then why did you not send to-"
"Because that would have been useless, sig-
nor. Sit down and listen to what I have to say."
Guilio obeyed the imperative motion of Scar-
latti's hand, as he continued:
"It would he better, perhaps, that you sl%~1d
hear it from the men who accompanied them.
Shall I call them? They are without."
"No," answered the Roman; "let me hear it
from yourself. But at once, I implore you."
The bandit smiled bitterly.
"flow impatient love ever is !" he muttered;
and then he went on. "At the post-house, a quar-
ter of a mile ft-tim where he stopped, Della Torre
procured another carriage. During his brief ab-
sence the Signora Anna, and the old lady who
had been stolen with her,-a very curious taste
he must have to steal an old woman of sixty,"
interjected Scarlatti,-" prayed and entreated
my men to allow her to fly. She offered them
her jewels, money-enough to make them rich
ftir life-would they only permit her to escape."
"Whydid they not do so?" passionately de-
manded Castelli.
"Because they had no orders from me to do
so," answered the bandit; "because they knew
that theirs would have been an extremely short
shrift when I once knew it."
He paused, as if for Castelli to answer him;
but finding he did not, he continued speaking

"When Della Torre returned with the carriage
which he had procured, they were compelled to
enter it; and for the first four miles, the men
who rode beside it heard loud voices within.
These by degrees died away, and all withiii the
carriage was still and early on the following
morning they arrived at Terracina. To the as-
tonishment~ of Paulo,-for the other is a fool,
and is never astonished at anything,-Della
Torre and the ladies drove up to the principal
hotel, and there he dismounted and inquired for
rooms. Certainly, they could have a magnifi-
cent parlor-all the parlors in a hotel are mag-
nificent-and two chambers adjoining it. Della
Torre handed the ladies out of the carriage, -
paid my men the remainder of the sum which it
had been stipulated he should give me for my
assistance,~and then returned into the inn. Paulo
and his companion went to an acquaintance of
mine who does business for us, and there break-
fasted. Poor fellows, a bottle of brandy had
been all they had since seven on the preceding
evening. Some two hours afterwards they again
made up their minds to return. One of them
thought it might be best to inquire whether
Della Torre intended stopping there. It was
Paulo, of course. Vou know that subsequent
business, as indeed it proves now, might have
required that knowledge. Paulo is essentially
a man of the world; he ought to he my lieu-
tenant; but mutele is a great advantage to au-
thority, and so the Hercules, who is waiting for
his supper, is. However, Della Torre was
ready gone, and what is more singular, the two
ladies had accompanied him. 'And on which
road?' asked Paulo. The waiter was an old
friend of his, and he had occasionally taken a
purse or two; hut in a contemptible way. Be-
ing a coward, he hesitated. Paulo slipped a
scudi into his hand; the love of money overcame
him, and he chuckled as he said, 'The road to
Naples!' They immediately turned from the
door of the betel, and presented themselves be-
fore me this morning, having occasion to do a
little business on their road which somewhat de-
tained them."
Guilio had listened to the details that Scarlatti
had given him with amazement. What power
could Bernardo so suddenly have acquired over
Anna Brigni I What was it which could have
induced her so suddenly to accompany him from
Terracina? Did she-but, no that was abso-
lutely impossible-at le so he fancied. He
then looked at Scarlatti, a curiously

watching the change and emotion traced upon
his face.
"Well, what do you intend doing l" he asked.
"The soprano would seem to have suddenly
grown reconciled to the scoundrel. He, of
course, must be the basso-bassi are always
scoundrels," muttered the ex.vocalist. "Has
my employment in this matter ended I"
"By no means I"
"I am glad to hear that," replied Scarlatti.
"One cannot-'-skilful financier as one may be-
every day manage to pick up two thousand
scudi."
"We will proceed to Terracina."
"Most certainly, if you wish it."
"And that instantly."
"0, no, signor! We shall have to wait while
our worthy lieutenant is refreshing his inner
man. Besides, Paulo, and my namesake, Gui-
seppe, are both excellent trenchermen. You will
excuse their intrusion, I feel certain. I will take
the liberty of calling them. Hallo, Andrea 1"
"Well!" roared, rather than spoke, the fero-
ciously hungry voice of Scarlatti's lieutenant.
"You can enter if you will."
Andrea rushed rather than strode into the
tomb. He hounded towards the empty platter,
seized it, looked into it, and groaned audibly.
Paulo had sprung on the quarter of spring mut-
ton, and had already commenced carving huge
collops from it; the namesake of Scarlatti heap-
ad more wood upon the fire. Andrea bent over
it, and looking like a famished bear, commenced

cooking the steaks. Castelli felt oppressed by
the dense and heavy atmosphere in the tomb-
still more, perchance, by the bustle of so savage
a life as that which he saw around him and he
rose and stole opt into the open air.
When, in half an hour, he again entered the
tomb, Guiseppe was stretched nppn the floor
sleeping, and the other three had finished the
quarter of the sheep between them. Its bare
bones were scattered upon the rough and uneven
earth, which formed the floor of that rude chain-
ber, and three or four emptied bottles were
strewn upon the ground. They were engaged
in drinking. Paulo, who, as far as Guilio could
see by the light of the fire that had again burnt
low, was a sensible-looking and handsome little
rascal, with ~prodigiously broad shoulders, inti-
mated to Andrea that he had better wake the
captain.
Andrea complied with his request, and bend-
ing over him laid his hand upon his shoulder.
The latter yawned, stretched out his arms, swore
a fierce oath or two, and rose. Then he saw
the Roman gentleman standing near to him.
With the bow and the smile of the man of the
world, he murmured an apology, and led the
way into the open air. In five minutes more,

tered some of that mixed provender which is

She wrenched her fingers from that grasp, and
fell back upon her seat. She covered her face
with her hands as if to shut out the sight of him
-for she had recognized that voice and knew
she was in the power of Bernardo Della Torre.
"Anna, you now see that my love is not light-
ly to be shaken from you. Stung by your cold-
ness, I determined that you should listen to 1110.
In Rome you could close your doors upon me;
you could forbid me to speak; you would have
told to Torlogna everything. I decided on tak-
ing this step; nor have I done wrong in choosing
my course.,~
She wrung her hands as she heard him; she
did not answer him, for she could not speak.
"You are a brigand, and a good-for-nothing
wretch !" screamed Madame Salicetti, as she lis-
tened to him. "Only to think that I at my age
am exposed to such an outrage! If it had but
been the Prince Colonna, or even the Conde di

"it is more than probable you might have for'

"I !.-.-never 1"
"If not at the present moment, to-morrow, or
the day after; at least, I think so."
There was a bitterness in his voice, which van-
ished from it as he turned to Anna Brigni.
"You have not answered me; nor do I desire
that you should now do so. Remember that you
are in my power-completely in my power, and
It is at your own option how that power is to he
exercised. Should you choose, peaceably, to
continue the road to Naples with me; content to
pass as my sister, without revealing the history
of this night to any whom we may meet, my
escort will be at your service. I will endeavor
to erase from your mind what has gone by, with
the tenderness of my passion."
She made him no answer.
"If you will not consent to this, I have but
one recourse left. Thirteen miles from Terra.
cina, there is a lone house. It stands apart from
all others, and the nearest dwelling to it is at a
distance of seven miles. It lies in the mountains,
and thither shall I bear you."

"Wretch! villain l"screamed the old lady, as
she listened to his threat.
"'Madame," said Bernardo, "the choke will
be In the hands of Signora Brigni. I will but
follow her will."
As he said this, once again he relapsed into
silence; and shortly afterwards, one of his asso-
clate~, in this most daring and thus far very sue-
ceesful piece of villainy, rode up to the window
of the carriage and addressed~him, us the driver
stopped at some distance from a tolerably, bright
light that was burning before him upon the road.
"There is the post-house," he said.
Della Torre immediately quitted the vehicle.
"I presume," he said, as he stood by the side
of the man who had addressed him, "that, yoft
might possibly find some difficulty in procuring
a conveyance 'I"
"I should think so," answered the man, with
a harsh sneer upon his thee, as he gently patted
the neck of his horse. It was felt rather than
seen by the I'iedmontcsc. "The only one that
they ever let me have was never again returned
to them. As for the body of the vetturiAo, why,
that was found on the road between it and Ter-
raclna, and a bloody cross Was drawn on its
chest I" -
Bernardo shuddered as he heard this cold-
blooded confession; it grated confoundedly upon
his nerves. As for the driver, he cowered and
crouched upon his seat, as if he bad actually felt
the edge of a knife drawn across his throat.
"You most lend mc y6ur horse, then."
"Certainly," said Paulo, who was the speaker;
and as he uttered this, he dismounted.
The Piedniontese sprung upon the animal,
and striking it with his heel, bounded off in the
direction of the post-house, while the bandit re'
manned standing near the carriage, and under the
~yes of Anna, who was barely able in that etn-

It has been already mentioned, that no sooner
had Della Torre Left the spot, than Anna Brigni
attempted to induce her captors by every bribe
within her power, to permit her return to Rome;
this was, however, useless. When Iernardo

scene that lay beneath it. Before her were the
woods of orange and lemon trees, intermingled
with the majestic Cypress, rows of which form
the boundary of the garden. Beyond theta
stretched the clear and heaven-blue Mediterra-
nean, dashing its waves of sapphire above the
broken masonry of Romanbath and ancient tem-
ple ~ntside the wall of that lovely spot., Boats,
with their white sails spread, in the distance,
balanced themselves like birds upon that azure
and tideless sea.

CHAPTER XIV.
AN UNExrEOTED RaCOGNITION.

IT was on the second morning after the details
given in our last chapter, that a travelling car-
riage was drawn up before the door of the hotel,
called Cicero's Villa, in Mola di Gacta. A
party of travellers, who had arrived there at
noon on the preceding day, and had been com-
pelled to remain there during the evening in con-
sequence of the illness of the younger lady-a
woman "bsl!a corn' en' angela," said the host,-
were now about to proceed to Naples. Every-
thing was correct. Anticipating that the Brigni
would rather consent to travel on with him to
the loveliest city in the world, as his sister, than
remain a prisoner in the habitation to which he
had proposed to take her, passports had been
provided are hehad quitted home; Bribery will
do anything in Papal or Neapolitan Italy. The
only difficulty to a stranger is to measure its
amount. Della Torre was a native of Genoa,
and he had lived in Rome, conseq~iently he had
not paid one scudi too much for what he wanted.
At Terracina he had, moreover, taken advantage
of their brief pause to provide a sufficient amount
of baggage. At present, it is true, his rrunks
were filled with hay; but what didthat matter?
A liberal fee at the frontier of the kingdom of
Naples had prevented their being opened, andat

But indescribably lovely as was the scene that
lay stretched before her eyes, they were almost
unconscious of its fairy beauty. Her thoug~$s
were far away-they were with Guillo- Singular
as it may seem, her sense instinctively felt-nay,
it knew that the young Castelli had returned to
Rome. And if it indeed were so, what must he
~ow think of her? What was there that he
would not he told of her? Should he see Tor.
logna, what would not the wealthy banker im-
pute to the vanished vocalist? And, moreover,1
whit by any chance could he hear that would he
worse for him to know, than the fact that she
was travelling to Naples, under the care and
with the assumed title of the sister of Bernardo
Delia Torre. The name might be assunled;
fbr a while it might hide her shame, but s~&amp;iier
or later it must. be known to him, and then
where should she hide herself? Alas! she
could but die.
As these thoughts crossed her mind, Madame
Salicetti rushed into her chamber. Annalooked
at her with, such a woe-stricken expression of
countenance that at any other time the old lady
would have been terrified. Now she laughed,
with the tears of her joy standing in her eyes.
"Anna! mia figlia Anna! we shall not have
to go on to Naples I" she cried' out; and she
clapped her hands together as she said so.
The Brigni still luoke4 at her without speak-
ing.
"0, it is true, my child Vengeance ~ias
found him out. He had fancied he was to have
it all his own way, the wretch 1"
"What is it?" said Anna Brigni, risingto~r
feet, as she spoke. At that moment the death of
Bornardo would have caused her, no sorrow.
"'Torture me not, but tell me I"
"The villain has fallen 4own, and his leg is
broken. How I wish it were his neck I', an-
swered Madame Sailcetti.'
Nevertheless, grieved as we are to record the
fact) we are obliged to state that this, was a gross
exaggeration of the elderly lady's. He had gene
into the city-if, indeed, it is to be called' a city
-'of Gaeta,,sn hour since, 'after leaving orders
for everything to be in readiness for their de
parture. Here a misfortune had befallen him-
he had fallen and had severely sprained his an-
kle; this, ladeedso severely that he was obliged
to be borne home to the hotel in the carriage of
a wealthy Englishman, who happened tobe pass-

ing at the time when he had met with the acci-
dent.
Now it- so chanced that this Englishman had
heard the hotel-keeper's report of the singular
beauty of the Signor ]3ernardo'a sister, and,
though "bella corn' un' angela" is an exceedingly
common style of eulogy in that most hyperboli-
cal of all climes-Italy being, like the greater
portion of your travelling idlers, a great admirer
of female loveliness, the Hon. Lumley Ferrers
was extremely anxious to see her. The fact,
too, that he had assisted her brother, gave him a
pretext for gaining admission to her presence.
He would take the liberty of visiting 'her and
informing her of his accident. He accordingly
committed his card to the charge of one of the
waiters, and instructed him to rcrjuest the honor
of an interview of a few momesiti with the sig.
a
nora.
"Do you know him I" asked the Brigni of
Madame Salicetti, showing her the card.
"I believe," said the waiter, being very aux-
ions to forestalLthe Hon. Mr. Lumley in his de.
livery of the intelligence, and laying himself out
to be questioned; "I believe i~hat he visits you,
signora, at your brother's request."
To his astonishment, no question was put to
him.
"He wishes to inform you of tIed accident that
has happened to the Signor Bernardo."
"I suppose that we must see him, then."
"Yes, you can admit him," said Madame Bali-
cetti to the waiter, who stood near witlihis budget
of news trembling on the tip of his tongue. Corn.
pletely baffled, the mai~ withdrew from the apart.
ment.
Now had he either s~i4 nothing, or chosen to
say ~verytbing that he knew, it is more than
probable that Anna Brigni would have declined
l~eing intruded upon, and have entrusted him
with a polite message to that effect. And had
Anna I3rigni done so, it is barely possible that
sheinight not have been discovered by the Sig-
nor Castelli for many weeks. We merely men-
tion this for the sake of proving to the readers
that even a travelling linglishman and his inva-,
riable curiosity may at times be converted by
chance into an actual utility.
TheHonorable Mr. I~umley Ferrers was ehown
into the chamber by the domestic, who imme-
diately quitted it. The Signora Brigni rose from
her scat to receive him. Mr. Ferrers bowed and

AT ten o'clock 6n the following morning, the
~ carriage of Lumley Ferrers was waiting at the
doorway of the hotel; and shortly after he led
the Brigni and Madame Salicetti down the steps
towards it They entered the carriage.
"Do you not accompany us "" inquired'the
elderly lady, as Lumley closed the door upon
them.
"I do, madame."
"B~it howl" and she looked round as she ut-
tered the question4 She saw a horse standing

"He is decidedly a gentleman," muttered the
Salicetti; as she leaned back in the carriage.

moment as she took his arm at the door of her
chamber to descend the staircase, he thought
that he had rarely seen any one so beautiful.
Her lair hair flashed in the morning light where
it escaped fromher straw bonnet; her blue eyes
swaxti with that mingled joy and fear which now
filled her whole being; her cheeks were pale,
but this onlyincreased the intellectual appear-

wreathed her rosy lips added an almost hale-
~ctihable loveliness to her fltee As Lumley

"I should like to know what the management
of the Aliberto have done without you."
"You should," questioned the Brigni.
"Why, of course I should. What on earth
can you be thinking of? Your absence must
have rendered it impossible for them to have
produced Cimarosa's new opera. I shouldn't
be at all surprised if. the management were to
bring an action against you for the. breach of
your engagement. Damages would be very in-
convenient. I feel certain that Issiac could not
pay them."
The name she had mentioned recalled the
Brigni to herse~he remembered, and re-
proached herself idferely as she did so, that for
the last few days she had seemed completely to
'have forgotten her second father. How much
must he have suffered; how bitterly it must
have cut him to the heart, to fancy that she had
quitted him, without even a word or letter to
bid him farewell. It was in vain that she now
attempted to frame excuses for her forgetfulness
of what be must have suffered. "I was his
vbild-his only one," she murmured to herself;
"and unheeding all his kindness, I have suffered
say thoughts to be wrapped up in the love of an-
other; not one memory of his kindness a~4tened

rapldlyaa if her only occupation in life was that
of~s~klng.
It was early in the morning of the second day
frosn~ this, that Guillo Castelli, with his three

class of life we have alluded to. Paulo looked

indisputably the most distinguished of the three.
He might have beeu taken as one of those law-
yers who are to be found in all countries. In
our own they maygenerally be discovered loung-
ing about the Tombs: Castelli opened his eyes
as they fell upon them.
"You see, signor," said Scarlatti, "it might
scarcely have suited you to have h~d~ us recog-
nized. Hereafter it might have beele inconveni.
eat to you. You might have been taken for one
of us."
Andrea grinned. He would have laughed, but
Scarlatti had strictly forbidden his giving vent
to his mirth. That roar would have been recog-
nized wherever it had once been heard.
"And now, whet have you done I Have you
questioned the waiter ~" asked Guiseppe.
"I have; but he was unable to tell me any-
thing."
"Or, probably, only unwilling."
"I was about to request the presence of the
landlord."
"It is unnecessary."
Scarlatti thought a moment, and then said to
Paulo:
"Go down and find out the waiter who told
you they, had gone to Naples. Find out the
name they were travelling by. Pay him ten
scudi"
As Paulo quitted the room, ho took out a lit.

expense.
"It is a necessary one," he observed to C~stelll.
"Yes, yes," uttered the other, impatiently.
"He may be useful again."
It need scarcely be observed that Paulo was
accustomed to the orders of his captain. He
gave the waiter no mbre 4than two, It was a
clear gain to Scarlatti of tight scttdi. Shortly
after the brigand re-entered the apartment.
"What have you discovered, Paulo ?"
"They started for Naples, under the names of
the Signor ai~dSignora Verami," was the reply.
Guillo started.. A fierce and sudden gush of
jealousy blazed through him.
"The lady appeared entirely reconciled to
him; he, himself, handed her into the carriage.
The waiter knows nothing more.
"We will at agee proceed, then," replied the
'captain,-as he quitted the chamber. Guilio fol-
lowed him.
In five usispates more, Castel1i~ acc9nlj3anied
by the three brigands, was galloping aleug~ the
road to Naples. A qionsand bitter and passions

ate thoughts were whirling through the brainof
the young Roman. He could not believe that
Anna Itrigni had, in truth, forgiven the crime of
her abduction to Dellt~ Torre And yet when
she was here-when she might so easily have
spoken to the people of the hotel; when she
could have demanded the assistance of the autho-
rities-why h$ she not done so? Her silence
made him suspect everything. If, indeed, ha
should find that she loved another-if he were
compelled by her owufree decision to resign her
-then Della Torre.might take her; he would
not trouble him. All he prayed for was, that
never again might he be ensnared 'by female
loveliness.
It was in the earlymorning, as we have else-
where stated, that theyarrived in ~1aples. They
passed through Mola di Greta before dawn.
Consequently they had not been able to make
the same inquiries at Cicero's Villa which they
had hitherto made at every hotel upon the road.
The air was gray with the mist of early day
when they came within sightof the city. Neither
Vesuvius nor Capri was visible; but the corn
stood juicy and green in the fields under the tell
fruit2trees and poplars, round which the wanton
vines twirled in hundreds of circling festoons nnd
varied wreaths.
"You must make our inquiries here, signo~"
said Scariatti, pointing, as he spoke, to a guard-
house. "I and Paulo are too well known to
risk too close an inspection of our persons; and
the talents of Andrea, though great in his own
line of business, are scarcely sufficient to fit hint
for the post of inquisitor-general, were it offered
him."
Castelli complied with the intimation, and
rode towards the guard-house, as they entered
the city. The splendid Toledo street lay before
them. Tables, loaded with fruit, were standing
before the doors of the smaller houses; hut, ex-
cept the fruit vendors, who were preparing for
their morning labors, there were few stirring in
this portion of the city. Before a corner-house,
the brands of a half-extinguished fire were scat-
tered. Beside them lay two men, half naked.
They were clad only in coarse linen drawers.
Here Scarlatti paused to await the approach of
the young Roman.
"He is not in Naples," said Guilio, as he rein-
ed in his horse at the spot where they stood.
"Not in Naples I'! uttered Scarlatti.
"He must be l'~ growled Andrea, with an
ominous yawe.

"We must have missed him by not pausing
to inquire after him at Gacta," continued Castelli.
"What do you now propose doing '*"
"Should we not return to Gaeta, and at once I"
"Decidedly," responded Scarlatil, as he swerv-
ed his horee onee~gain round, to thQ entrance of
the Toledo.
"Look here," said Andrea, "I need an hour's
rest, My horse and myself are alike worst out.
The Signor Verami will not run away, if indeed
he b~ there."
"The Signor Veranti !" squeaked out a shrill
voice, as the last words were spoken. "I should
think notindecd."
Theylooked round. One of the men we have
noticed as lying on the ground beside the ses~sains
of the fire, had partially risen. His long, and
un8llorn hair fell about his swarthy brow, un-
kempt and nncared for, while his keen, black
eyes glared from the midst of its tangled locks
with the look of a fox, who is e*cessivel.y hust-
gry, and begins to scent a capon.
"And what do you know about him, then ~"
said Guiseppe, as his eyes fell' on the lazzarone.
With a curious grin, the latter looked on the
brigand- but as he did so, the smile faded u~t0,~n 2
his countenance, and a look of the darkest a~
mosivindictive hatred flashed over it. He leap.~
ed to his feet.
"Well, what have you to say?"
"What will you give me I" inquired the nean~
whose countenance had again relapsed into its
usual apathy.
Scarlatti had loosened his rein, and wsts pro-
ceeding towards the city. Guilio followed him,
and in another instant was riding beside him.
"As soon as we reach the guard-house, dash
forward !" whispered the brigand. "This fellow
knows me."
He then turned to the lazzarone.
"Will a scudi pay you I" he asked, carelessly.
"Yes."
Guiseppe turned on his horse and made a
sign to Paulo, who* bent across to Andrea and
whispered to him.
The lazzarono saw it, and With a sudden
spring laid his hand on the bridle of Scarlatti's
horse; at the sante instant Guillo dashed his
spu~s into the flanks of his horse, anfibonuded
forward, followed by Andrea and Paulo.
"Hal hal" shouted the lazzarone. "
so, Guiseppe Searlatti, you are in Naples ag
The sentry at the guard-house sfiw the Waggle
and heard th~ cry. He rushed into the room

where the soldiers were getting their soup and
bread ready for their morning's meal.
"Come outl-he is here I"
"Who I"
"Il diavolo Scarlatti I"
~In another instant the brigand, who had dash.
ed the lazzarone from him, was struggling to
force his waythrough the guard. Guillo looked
back; the instinct of a gentleman stirred within
him; he had broken bread with Scarlatti; he
could not thus leave him; he slackened his
horse's pace.
"What are you pausing foil" asked Paulo.
"I cannot leave him I" was the short answer.
"Nonsense I" roared Andrea, "you must! It
was his own order."
"But-"
"Pahaw I-you will see him again, ere noon."
"Should he-"
"But I tell you he commanded us to accom-
pany you. Did he not, Paulo I"

"Well; as you choose," replied Guilio, not,
perhaps, altogether displeased to find that in pur-
suing his journey back to Gauta he was but
complying with Scarlatti's own wish.
They were already within sight of the hotel
which they had passed that morning before
dawn, when Andrea's horse, which l~ad beentoil-
ing heavily, fell undei~ him. A~the brigand
fell with him, a fierce curse broke from his lips.
"I knew it would come to this," he said, as
he looked at the panting beast. "That cursed
Scarlatti has no pity either for man or horse.
What am I to do ~"
"Provide yourself with au~ther, if it be Pos-
sible, and then come on to the hotel."
Castelli flung his purse upon the ground, and
dashed up the street towards the doorway of the
inn.

TsezAandlord hastened to the entrance of
Cicero's Villa, as Guilio Castelli dismounted
from his steed; but the usual babble ot' a con-
tineutal inn-keeper died upon his lips as he
gazed upouthe young man. His attire, costly
as it ~yae,~wus stained and fra$d with his rapid
travel; a ghastly pallor sat upon his face; the
close and matted curls of l4s~hair hung heavily
athwart his brow-yet )n spite of the general
disarray of his attire, there was something s~
clearly evidenced in every movement that mark-
ed the gentleman, as to impress the landlord,
who, without~ uttering a word, bowed and fol-
lowed him into the hall on the ground floor of
the hoteL Here, Guiio paused.
"I wish to speai with the landlord." '~
"Hi-stands before you, excellenza."
"Conduct me at once into your own room."
The hotel-keeper opened his eyes. It was a

diamond pin in his cravat ihere was a watch-
chain, too, hanging across, his waistcoat-of
course, t~zere was a watch in it. With a low
and cringing bqw, he conducted the young man
te his sanetura.

Castelli flung himself into a chair and exam~
med the landlord, who remained standing. The
latter was completely puzzled; his penetration,
acute as it usually was, found itself at fault.
The manner of his singular guest was ant at all
that of a man who needed money. ~ fclt

longer believed that he required cash?

THE TRANELLER OvEItTAKEN.

WHEN Guilio had left the hotel, the fire that
Della Torre had kindled within his bosom was
still blazing. He noticed not the condition of
his horse; he saw not that neither Andrea nor
Paulo w~re waiting for him. Without a word
to the obsequious hotel-keeper, who had 'descend-
'ad the steps of the inn with -him; without be-
stowing a coin upon the boy who had held his
horse, he snatched the bridle from his hands,
sprung upon its back, and striking it with his
spurred heel, he swept up the road to Rome.
"Why didn't he pay mu I" whimpered the
boy.
"Just catch me again trusting to a man's
promise," muttered the host. "My intelligence
was to be well paid for! Hang him! I believe
that his excellenna is not worth a scudi !"
The day wore on, and it drew near evening
are Castelhi had passed the frontiers of Naples.
Worn out by all which he had that day gone
through the excitcmeut~pf the morning com-
pletely blotted out in the deadening angui~h that
mastered him as he thought that Anna Brigni
was nd'w lost to him forever, he noticed not how
greatly the animal which he was riding had suf-
fered from the exertions which his master's will
had forced upon him.
For the seven or eighth time in almost as
many minutes, l'e had raised his hand with the

whip in it, to strike the jaded steed, when the
sound of hoofs rapidly striking the ground be-
hind him, caused him to tura his head. As he
did so, a loud voice was heard: -
"Hulk,, signor !" it cried; "but you ride fast.
A pest upon it! but I had nearly ruined my
animal in attempting to overtake you!"
Guillo recognized the flexible accents of Gui-

looked at Guillo's horse.

your animal is in a worse condition than mine is.
The heavens be thanked that we are no more
than' a mile from the next post-house; there we
may find fresh h*ses."
"How did you escape t" askel Guillo.
"I had a little fighting fot' it. Blood ran,

answered the brigand, pointing to ~the -

with which handkerchief that was bound around
his left arm was crimsoned. "However, I got
away; dined at a little cottage which I know,
about half a mile from the main road, on the
other side of Gaeta,,and am now here. I have
told you my story, Signor; I now want to hear
what you have done."
In a few words Guillo told Scarletti what had
passed between him and Della Torre. As he de-
scribed the manasr in which he 'had hurled him
to the other end of the apartment where he had
found him, the bandit drew back and regarded
the young Roman long and scrntinizingly.
"Per Bacco! but it is singular," he said
"what strength rage gIves a man.' I eduld have
sworn that he was big enough to eat you for a
meal, signor !-and yet you talk as coolly of
having thrown him across the room, as I could
of eating a roasted capon. Well, well, I sup-
~ese there is something in blood after all. Not
that I have found it so," he muttered, with a
jocular laugh. "But all men are not ~carlattis.
Aa4 now, I suppose," he continued, "you are
hurrying along the road to Rome, in a fever of
love and joy-"
"Qf love and joy ~" answered Guillo.
"Certainly; you will see the bela Brigni
again, and-"
"Never 1"
Guiseppe cast a quick and piercing glance at
the young m&amp;n as he answered thus; then he
-whistled, and looked up in the sky. Appar-
ently, he did not find what he seal~ched for
there, as he again bent his eyes upon Castdlli.
"And why,-if I may take the liberty of ad-
dressing you such a question.~-signor 2" were
the words which he uttered after the lapse of a
few moments.
"Xiave I not told you all that he said of her

~      "Whom t"
"The Englishman-Lumley Ferrers."
"You did."
The young man was silent; he either could
not or' would not speak. Guisdppe Scarlatti
smiled.
"And is this your only reason ?"
"Is it not a sufficient one ~"
-~ '     "The bandit laughed long and loudly as this
question was put to him; then he bent from his

than ever.
"Per Bacco !" but this is too good. Ha!
ha! ha! signor; and you actually believed the

A sudden light flashed across the mind of
Castelli, and he reined in his steed. Searlatti
did the same.
"Itwas a lie-but no !-the landlord told use

Castelli.
"Of course they (lid, signor."
"Amid you think-"
"That nothing could he more natural. The

nothing more nor less than a scoundrel. After
this he takes her back to Rome. Della Torre is,

Guilio had listened to ~carlatd's rapia deduc-
tion of' the amount of truth whieb there was in
the slander~ of Bcrnardo, with a countenance
from which the clouds were rapidly e~earing.
As the bandit came to an end, he said:

"Lovers always are idiots," muttered Scar-

"Then you think that she is-"

"Let ur get on to the next post-house," said
Gnilio, as he again urged his steed into the at.

In less 'than quarter' of an hour, they had

Scarlatti had stepped to the window of the lbw

place for the reception of travellers who m~ht

past. The smaller of these reined in and called
the attentarn of the other to one of, th~ horses
which were standing at the rack to the right of
~iis house, devouring tt~eir provender.' This
called Guiseppe's attention' to them. Immedi-

the chamber. One of the domestics was arrang-

him and , then at 'Guillo; the latter understood
him, and did not speak.

where we had purchased him for the purpose of

to catch a sight of three of the Roman police,
who were turning the corner of the street."
"Three of the Roman police !" ejaculated the
brigand. "You mast have been mad, Paulo !"
"So I told him," grumbled Andrea.
"You wanted me there to open~ynur eyes ~

"The eighth of an inch taken off eacir of your

very uncomfortably the while he was speaking-
Scarletti's jest ev~idently struck him as having
too much meaning to be very agreeable; "hut

"And lucky was it that you did so, for~ in less

Andrea.

cast a comic and somewhat curious glance over

"They were, accompanied by three of the

A faint murmur was heard in answer to this,
but they could not detect the words.
"0, just as you choose, mademoiselle, just as
you choose. If you do uot choose to comply
with my demands, I will have you arrested this
very evening."
"But I assure you, signor-"
"I will not hear another word! Two nights
hence you shall appear and sing for me through
the remainder of my present season without a
single scudi of salary, or else I shall be obliged
to put you in prison for debt, on the score that
you have wantonly broken your engagement."
"What an infernal scoundrel I" said she ]3or-
ghese.
Torlogna caught him by the arm whiclr he
was extending towards the handle of the door,
and drew him gently back.
"Let us hca~ her answer," he whispered.
She spoke; but again the words could not be
distinguished by them. The reply which was
made her was audible enough.
"I shall not think of waiting, mademoiselle!
Make your choice, and at once !"
This time they heard her answer very clearly.
"Then, sir, I refuse !"
"Very well, mademoiselle," was the answer.
Is was accompanied by a coarse oath; then a
heavy step was heard approaching the door. It
swung open, and the manager bf the Aliberto
stood in the presence of the prince and the Ro-
man banker. As his eye caught those of Tor-
logna, his whole face changed color, and he stag-
gered back.
"Villain I" cried the Borghese, as he hounded
towards the Signora Brigni, who was leaning
upon the back of a chair, very pale and very
indignant.
He caught her by the hand. Then he turned
upon the cringing manager, and surveyed him
with a look that might ha~e withered the un-
fortunate man, could he have seen any one else
than Torlogna.
"What have you been saying to her who will
soon be the bride of my brother, Guilio Cas-
telli?"
Anna Brigni uttered a short and sharp cry of
joy, as she fell back fainting in the arms of
Federigo.
"So, sir," sai4 the hanker, "you were talk.
ing of arresting tIre Signora Brigni ?"
"I-really-I---did not know-"

"Unless she consented to sing for you the
remainder of the season without a single scudi
of sal~sry 1"
The manager was very evidently in a dilemma.
"Signor, exceilcuza, will you listen to me l"
"No, sir-not to a single word I" was the harsh
reply of Torlogna.
"Let ~
"To-morrow, at nine o'clock, you will repay
me the sums that I advanced you at the com-
mencement of the present season. If in half an
hour afterwards the money is not in my hands,
you will be arrested!"
~' I implore the excelleuza-"
"With interest, mind you! Be ready, or-"
The manager fell on his knees.
"You know the penalty."
"Great Heaven, I shall be ruined !"
"Of course-I 1~tend you to be !" replied
Torlogna, as he turned his back upon him.
The manager again arose to his feet, and at-
tempted to address the wealthy banker.
"Will you go? We would be alone," said
Torlogna.
Wailing like a child that has been subjected
to the whip, the manager quitted the apartment.
Pederigo had, meanwhile, laid Anna Brigni
upon a couch at the further end of the chamber.
He had then turned and rung the bell which
stood on the table. As he did so, Madame Sa-
licetti entered the room. Scarcely had she ap-
proached the sufferer than she began slowly to
recover. When her senses were at first restored
to her, she looked round the chamber with a
wandering and unsettled glance. Her eyes at
length rested on Federigo.
"You need be under no apprehension, sig-
nora !" uttered the banker; "I have dismissed
that vagabond "-this was uttered with the dig-
nity of a man of money-" who has been mis-
managing the Aliberso; he will not return to
annoy you."
"I thank you, signor."
The Borghese then approached the sofa.
"Did I-" She paused and fastened a mean-
ing look upon the y~ung prince. "Did I hear
you aright "' she asked.
"I presume, Signora Anna, that you did."
His tone more than his words convinced her
that she had done so. A heavenly smile broke
over her countenance as she listened to him.
Federigo and Torlogna, both, thought that they
had never seen her look more beautiful than she
did then

74                  THE ROMAN SOPRANO.

"And where is Guiliol Why is he not here?"
she asked.
"He followed you on the track, which he had
discovered, of your flight. He has not yet re-
turned, signora."
Again her face brightened, and even more visi-
bly than it had before done. As Federigo mark-
ed the play of those flexible and lovely features,
he marvelled not at his brother's passion for her.
"And have you forgiven hjm ?"
"For what?" asked the young Roman.
As she lifted her eyes to his noble face, and
caught its pure and tender affection for his brother
traced as if by the finger of its Maker in every
line of it, she took his hand between both of hers,
lifted it, and pressed her lips upon it.
"Prince," she said, "you have a great heart I"
Torlogna looked from one to the other blindly,
like a man groping in th. dark. He compre-
hended neither of them. The young prince's
forgiveness of his brother would have been de-
nounced by him as a sheer act of madness, had
not he been a prince, and therefore one of Tor-
logna's best friends. As for the kiss which Anna
Brigni had imprinted on the young man's hand,
he looked on it as neither more nor less than a
confession of love. Probably he would have
pitied Guilio had he paused to think about it.
He was a man of money; nay, he could have
told within, a hundred scudi what would be the
amount of Federigo ]3orghese's fortune when Isis
father should have received the last consolations
of religion; but he took no note of his heart,
Had he be*en asked whether the young prince
had a soul, he would certainly have answered
"Yes." A banker invariably recognizes all the
dogmas of his religion. Who ever heard of a
man of money that was a free thinker? But to
divine what lay hidden within that soul-O, that
was essentially a different thing!
"But supposing that Guilio should meet with
Della Torre ?" said the Brigni, and she again
looked up at the prince.
"He would probably shoot him; I should !"
answered the Borghese, "with as little or less
qualm of feeling than I should experience in
spearing a wild boar, or shooting a wolf!"
As he ended, the banker began to speak. Uere
he was perfectly at home.
"There would be no necessity for resorting to

powder and bullet," he said, with an agreeable
chuckle. "I have provided for that rascal. To-
morrow I trust to have the pleasure of seeing
him!"
Federigo cast an inquiring glance upon the
banker. The old Roman rubbed his hands to-
gether, and chuckled to himself as ~e did so.
"You do not know anything ab9ut it, I see;
and, indeed, how should you? I never men-
tioned a word on this score to any one except the
police; they are confoundedly useful fellows.
The rascal swindled me oat of ten thousand
scudi; and did it, too, on the very day on which
he ran away with the Brigni."
The banker bowed to the signora as he said
this.
"The police got on his track through the pre-
caution I invariably take of marking each new
issue of notes differently. He had chanced to
receive the cash in the first notes of my last issue.
One of them came back to my cashier the day
after he had quitted Rome. It was easily traced
-it bad only passed. through two hands-to the
landlord of the principal hotel in Terracina. My
head clerk immediately went there and ques-
tioned him. He l~ad changed it for the Signor
Verami. Ha! ha! ha! that was the name he
had taken. Rh, Signora Anna! Three of the
Roman police were dispatched after him. Re
had crossed the Neapolitan frontier. That caused
a little delay; but I received a letter this morn-
ing whiph announces that he will be here to-
morrow."
"And what do you intend doing with him ?"
asked the Signora Brigni.
"That depends on his father."
"How does it depend on him ?" inqs4red
Federigo.
"I wrote to the old Della Torre," replied the
banker, "to ask whether he would make good
the deficit that the scoundrel had caused in my
cash-box. He answered me that since his son
had thus disgraced himself, he might rot in the
galleys! We shall see whether he changes his
mind."
"And if he should not ?"
"lie will certainly try that style of life," said
Torlogna.
"Heaven be thanked for it !" uttered the Sn-
licetti.

CHAPTER XXI.

A SEPARATION P11031 THE BANDITS.

IT was late at night, after the close of the same
day, that Guilio Castelli rode into Rome. He
was alone. With a praiseworthy regard for his
personal safety, Scarlatti had separated from the
young man in the Campagna, after intimating
to him that he should, in all probability, pay
him and Ii Principe Federigo a visit on the suc-
ceeding evening, as he was exceedingly anxious
-in fact he was astonished to find himself so
anxious-to hear how matters might terminate
between him and the Signora Anna.
Castelli smiled-four hours since he could not
have done so, as he thought that Scarlatal's in-
teiest in his love depended upon the passion
which the brigand entertained for the chance of
getting the scudi which had not been earned.
"Do not fear, Guiseppe !" he said. "You
fihall be paid."
"The signor is far too generous !" answered
the bandit. "To take the money would be pick..
ing the pocket of Milord Lumley Ferrers."
"Very well. That, ns you choose !"
"However, as I intended to have seized Mi-
lord, on his return from Naples, and have missed

him, through my fidelity to you, signor, I think
I may reconcile my conscience to the scudi."
As he galloped away, he said to Andrea, "It
would be a pretty thing to have wasted three
days, and not get paid for it."
Federigo Borgbese had already retired to his
chamber, as Guilio bounded up the stairs in the
Borghese palace, and rushed into the apart.
ment.
The young prince looked round as he did so,
and the brothers were once more together.
"She is in Rortie, is she not, Federigo""
"She is, my brother !"
"Have you seen her ?"
"Yes !"
GtAlio gazed wistfully on the face of the
young Borghese. He could not speak. A thou-
sand questions werd trembling on his lips. But
he knew not how to utter them. He longed to,
know whether she had spoken of him; what she
had said of him; how she looked when she heard'
that he had followed her; whether she had'
blushed when she listened to his name breathed
by his brother's lips; in one word, he wislied4


76                          THE ROMA]
to know whether Anna Brigni really loved
him.
The Borghese wound his arm around Guillo
and drew him beside him, upon the couch which
stood between the two windows at the end of the
apartment. "And have you, then, no more that
you would ask me, my brother "'
"Yes, Federigo I" The prince smiled on him
as he listened to his tremulous accents. "You
have mentioned me to her."
"I have."
"And, what? tell me, tell me all I" exclaimed
Castelli, as he bent an imploring glance upon
Federigo Borghese.
"Everything?" asked his brother, with a tor-
menting laugh; but, as he saw the pain which
his manner caused Castelli, he continued, in a
more serious strain, "Well, I will."
He then told Guilio, what.our readers already
know, together with much that had passed be-
tween himself and Anna Brigni, after Torlogna
had left them together.
"Then you think that she loves me I"
"Could you ever have doubted, Guilio, that
she did 2"
"Federigo, you have given me a new life."
"And now let me ask you, what I deserve
at your hands" While you were at Naples or
Mola do Gaeta, or wherever else you were, J
have avowed your passion, won you a wife, and,
what was a much more diffleult thing, Guilio,
have procured you the consent of our father to
your marriage I"
"What? Has he consented 2'~
'~He has. But not without the greatest diffi-
cuity. At first he said he would disown you,
unless you consented to separate yourself from
her. Itold him that this was impossible. Then
he tbreatened to have you imprisoned in the
castle of St. Angelo until you forgot her. I
answered that you never would. He laughed,
and said that.ehe could, at all events, forgetyou,
before the first year was over."
"Well?"
"I answered him, that, in that case, it was
more than probable that I myself might wed
her"
For one moment a sudden flush of jealousy
broke over the face of the young Castelli. But
even as it did so it began as rapidly to fade
rom It. "Forgive me, my own Federi~o !" he

said, as he clasped his brother's hand, and pas-
sionately pressed it in both of his.
"He looked at me without speaking. 'I am
perfectly serious,' I said to him. 'The Brigni
is a noble creature, and she would honor the
blood of theBorghese by consenting to an alli-
ance with it.' He looked at me, gravely, and
told me that the castle of St. Angelo might cure
my madness, too. I laughed when he uttered
this threat. 'The Brigni will not forget me,'
Replied. 'She would want to have the chance
of putting a coronet upon her brow."'
"Federigo I" murmured the young Castelli,
reproachfully.
"'But do you not know that she is a Jewess?'
he said, after a long pause, and raising his eyes
to mine."
"She is not I" cried Guilio.
"So I told him. 'She is the daughter of the
Signor Brigni, a learned professor of Bologna.'
His brow relaxed as I said this."
"No sooner had I discovered how deeply you
loved her, than I sought out the Jew Isaac, and
questioned him. You know that I despise the
prejudices that exist against that race in our
nation. But the old prince feels them, and feels
them to their fullest extent. Had she been a
Jewess, you must have respected his preju-
dices, and have cancelled her image from your
heart."
Guillo sighed, as he listened to his brother's
words. Then he raised his head, and looked
firmly and fixedly at him. "It could not have
been. Had she been a Jewess, I must have wed-
ded her. Ay, though it had cost me his love;
and, what I value far more, yours, my own Fed-
erigo."

a glance of affectionate pride filled his dark eyes.

CHAPTER XXII.
LOVE-TUE WEDDING-THE END.

LOVE, 50 says the Grecian fable, brought chaos
into order, and created the world. Around ev-
ery passionate and adoring heart, creation seems,
as it were, renewed. And a truth is shadowed
in that antique myth which reprints itself upon
our daily life. At least, so it was with Anna
Brigni and Guillo Castelli.
It was the early morning, and he stood within
her apartment. He was Waiting for the presence
of.her whose love filled his whole b~ii~. The
orange trees were breathing their fragrance
through the open windows of the little room.
What was' the perfume of their pale blossoms to
that of the joy' which was filling his soul?
Their leaves trembled in the rush of the sport-
ive and wanton breeze that was playing through
the street. What was that wavering tremulous-
ness to the quivering hope that stirred within
his bosom? What was the murmuring song of
the breeze to that deeper and more spirinial
chant of pleasure which was rising within his
heart?
At last she came.
Trembling and blushing, Anna Brigni stood
in the presence of her lover. Never had she
seemed to him more beautiful. Her golden hair
shimmered and flashed in the sun-light. Her
eyelids with their long and dark lashes fell over
her deep blue eyes, which seemed as for a mo-

mont she had gazed upon him when she en-
tered the apartment, swimming and dancing
with the light of love. Her bosom heaved with
the tumultuous tenderness which crowded out
all other thoughts than those which owned his
empire.
"Anna 1,'
When those tremulous accents fell upon her
ears, earth seemed as if it danced around her.
Love breathed its universal hymn of joy upon
her ears. The very murmurs from the street
without the windows seemed to join in shaping
that song of love.
With a short and gladsome cry she bounded
towards him.
"You love me, Anna ?"
She sunk upon his bosom.
In that embrace the young Roman forgot all
of hispast doubts. He had not told her that he
loved her, yet she knew and felt it in every por~
tion, and in each pulse of her life. She had n~t
answered him, but he could read her answer in
her eyes. He drew it from her lips with his
own.
"I have loved you," said he, "from the first
moment in which your sight filled me with a
new life. You know, and you can feel, what an
agony swept over me when, like a fool, I taught
my soul to doubt you, for you too love. This

He was anxious by a long absence to heal the

thathe wrung a consent from his father.

Was the high profession of all nations5 and chiv-

the two reigning principles, and a meagre renown
was that of the knight, who, though the hero of
many a battle-field, had not ci"" won victories
in the more rational and certe / more desira-
ble contests of love.
The time of which I write is one when Chris-
tendom seemed to have spent much of its power,
and the Baracen, Isy the awful strokes of his
s~#srthyarms, had stretched his sway under the
banner of the Crescent from the farthest East to
the' pillars of Hercules. No~ only so, but he
had stepped across the narrow barrier of sea,
where Europe and Africa almost embrace each
other at Gibraltar, and his nation had become
seated in that fertile region of mountain and
plain, of vineyard and wine, now the impotent
powers of Spain and Portugal-then Lusitania
~d Hispania.
The decline of Rome-the world's proud mis-
tress-had made way for the invasion of the
Moors into those fair regions, and under the

prophetic banner of Mahoinet the conquest be'
came complete at the commencement of the
eighth century. Spain was snhdued and passed
under the submissive yoke of the Caliphs of
Bagdad. The religion of the natives was that
of the Holy Cross, and between the inhabitants
who survived the Moorish conquest and the In-
fidels, no species of toleration existed~ By the
former the Saracen was considered Pagan, and
by him the latter were termed barbarian. What
comity could exist between such hostile elements't
Here and there-.-'-tiow and then-th'e spirit of
true chivalry broke through the brazen restraints
of the national sects; and the wild schemes of
the heart occasionally displayed occurrences
forming strong contrasts with prevailing custom.
Among the fugitives of Spain who escaped the
slaughter of the last battle with the invading
Moors, was the Irince Pelaglo; a noble and
chivalrous descendant of the moderti kings of
his country. his folloWers he led away into the
northern portion of the kingdom. Prom the
fastnesses of his mountain retreat, h'elagio stilt
contended for the liberty of his country, and not
unfrequently made victorious descents into the
immediate province of the Moors.

It was one of these occasions that gave rise
to the circumstances which Will form the features
of this story.
Hoderigo de relagio was the eldest son of the
rrince relagio-ayouth of high, martial spirit,
and possessed of all those chivalric requisites
which in his age at once characterized the sol-
dier and courtier. Trained In the camp as well
as the palace, Iloderigo combined in his nature
much of the nobility of the Roman (for Spain
being a Roman province, it was in the armies
of home that he had fought); as well as the
quick and haughty spirit so characteristic of his
nation.
Smarting under thc pains of submission, as
his family was, and fully sympathizing with his
father In the loss of his crown and country, Rod-
erigo was never fonud wanting In respect to his
appeals for vengeance; and if practicable, the
restoration to him of those priceless jewels.
Surrounded by his followers, therefore, the
four seasons of each year were the signals for
war with Roderigo as often as they approached.
And many a time did the Moorish usurpers of
his native Castilian valleys smart under the
heavy5 blows and dreadful carnage which were
dealt out by Roderigo and his soldiers as they
rushed down from their fnstnesscs in the Canta-
btiau mountains.
The immense wealth brought from Afi~ica by
the Moors made War on them in that day doubly
desirable. The conquests of the East had filled
the Moorish coffers not only with all the precious
products of Eastern mines, but likewise rich
fabrics and spices, and every desired luxury of
the most enlightened nation of the world were
to be found in the bazaars of merchants' of Spain
~nher maritime cities, and in transit through the
interior.
Nor were these all the rich objects of capture;
beauty, was also a prize. And how muebsoever
we may at this day condemn such deeds, and the
arguments that satisfied thosewho perform them,
it is nevertheless true, that, as the nations of I
Europe considered the Moors in the light of
idolaters and pagans, no sin was conceived to be I
committed in caPturing their beautiful daughters,
and leading them home in triumph, either for
pleasure or gain by ransom. The stimulus to a
soldier's action, contained in the war-shout of
"Beauty and Booty," is not one of modern date,
but has been a potent lever in the art of war
from the earliest ages. The Christian and the
Barbarian have alike responded to that ignoble
shout in all ages of the world.

The morning sun shone brightly over the long
range of mountain peaks as the Castilian army
under iloderigo were prepared once more to de.
scend upon their enemies who had usurped their
country. Never had the day-god ushered in more
lovely spring boringg than that on which the
gallant little army of the aspiring and patriotic
youth was ab6ut to strike another blow for his
family and captive country.
The pure white flag with a cross in the centre,
was the ensign of the proud house of Pelagio,
and as it waved gracefully oYer the steel-clad
warriors, a more charming sight could not have
been desired.
All was in readiness; but Roderigo waited for
a parting word from his noble father ere he start-
ed on his errand of war. Indeed, he desired
once more to embrace his mother and, sisters,
and receive their last blessing.
At length the prince appeared mounted upon
a black charger, surrounded by many nobles. who
still clung to his cause and house.
"I shall expect proud deeds of you, Roderi'
go," said the prince, as he came near to his son,
who, upon first discovering his father, at once
advanced to meet him.
"I shall expect proud deeds of you, my son,"
repeated the father. "With these troops you
can march into the heart of Castile, and humble
the dastard African who now pollutes my
throne."
"What arms can do, these arms shall win;
what bravery can accomplish, our deeds shall
prove," was the noble answer of Rocierigo.
"You have spoken like my son, Roderigo,"
said the prince. "Go, and when thou return'

and an hundred victories inscribed upon thy
banner."

grasped his father's hand for the last time;
flung himself upon his steed, waved his hand for
the march; the trumpet sounded and the bright
pennon, mailed soldier, and tramping war-horse,
all moved onward and were soon lost to the view
of those who were left behind.
The march continued several days, during
which period several skirmishes took place, in
which the valiant young Spaniard and his follow-
ers were victorious. their successes embolden-
ed them to press still farther on, until they
bearded the Moorish viceroy in his imperial seat
at l3urgos.
Inspired by the exalted thoughts and hopes
of rescuing their beloved Castile from the grasp
of the swarthy strangers of the South, Iloderigo
marched forward until the tenth day at sunset-
lug, when he found himself resting on a fertile
mountain of the Castilian range, to the north-
east of Burgos, where the usurper Abderahman
now held his summer court.
Upon this lovely spot the Castilian knight de-
termined to halt, until a favorable opportunity
presented itself of attacking the enemies of his
race. From their encampment Roderigo and
his followers might look down upon the ancient
city at their feet, and hear at the same time the
solejun chimes from the Moslem minarets at
evening, and catch the sweet strains of the joy-
ous ziraleet as they swelled out upon the clear
air of approaching night. Such proximity to
the Infidels as the Moors were termed, aroused
the enthusiasm of the Spaniards to the fullest
height, and it was with much difficulty that their
commander was enabled to prevent them from at
once rushing down Impetuously upon their ene-
mies, who, as yet, were wholly unconscious of
the presence of the Christian al-my.
At length, when all became quiet, and the sol-
diers reposed some in their tents, and others
among the fair groves surrounding their bivouac,
* Roderigo sumni~ed his lieutenants to his tent,
for the purpose adjusting the course of pro-
ceddings of the campaig~i.
"Thus, my trusty friends," said Roderigo,
"have we come Into the very heart of these In-
fidels, scattering them wherever we have met
them; It is for us now to turn our minds to the
great task of dispersing this unholy band of
- pirates from our native land, that we may re-in-
herit it as justly belongs to us. Come, let us
propose to ourselves some immediate course of
action. What sayest thou, worthy knight be
Dregauza?"

"My lord, I am for descending upon these
outcasts at early dawn, ore yet they have time to
turn their dastard eyes toward accursed Mecca,
Or utter their first prayer to their fiil~e god or
prophet.'~
these were the sentiments ~of a knight who
had fought not a few campaigns with the legions
of Home, from Thiton to the Euphrates; and
aIthou~h they were uttered in a bold, rough and
uncourtlike style, yet his words always had
great weight ip the counsels, as well as his sword
in the fight."
Many were the plans submitted, when, at
length, Roderigo condescended himself to pro'
pose a measure.
"My friends," he said, "as yet we are igno'
rant of the forces of the Moors. Before any
great result can be attained, it becomes necessary
that we should possess this inforu1zation. To
procure it, hazards must be run, and I, as your
leader, will share them with you freely. Come,
we will cast lots, and he upon whom it falls,
shall this night, disguised as a Moor, penetrate
within the walls of yonder city, discover the
strength of Abderahman, and bring us word of
all that he has learned."
This proposition was hailed with pleasure,
and every knight was emulous to accept the
mission should it fall to his lot. Danger and
skill prompted their brave hearts to dare the
encounter.
The lots were prepared, and one drew, and
then another, and still another, yet no choice had
been made~ Three others drew with like suc-
cess. Then only three remained to decide the
lot, and amOng these Roderigo himself was on9.
The two remaining knights put forth their hands,
trembling with hope, both drawing blanks. The
lot had fallen on Roderigo, their captain.
This result was as he had wished; for, hav-
ing served in the army of Rome in Syria, he
had gained not only a perfect knowledge of the
Moorish language, buthad also become acquaint-
ed with the customs and manners of the Moors.
He was, then, not only properly fitted for the
perilous enterprise by these important qualifica-
tions, but his bravery was also equal to the
emergency.                          -
Iloderigo therefore arrayed himself at once in
the habit of a poor mountain peasant, bade his
friends good-night, and descended through a
rugged pathway by moonlight toward the city,
on his expedition of espionage.

CHAPTER II.
Abderahman, a successful soldier under the
banner of the prophet, had risen from an hum-
ble ~osidon to one of exalted power and splen-
dor in the east; and after the conquest of Spain
by the Moors, became the viceroy of that con-
quered country. And whilst Cordova was se-
lected as the seat of the Moorish empire in Eu-
rope, yet were the palaces and court of the vice-
roy situated and held in many different places.
The time of which I am now writing finds Ab-
derahman and all his attendant nobles, together
with his royal family, in the city of Burgos, en-
*der the eye of a Castilian army~
It was a night of joy in this temporary Moor-
ish capital The city was illumined, and music
swelled out upen the evening quiet, like light
gladdening darkness. Festivities of every ~le-
scription were the delights of the senses, and the
beautiful city seemed one of love and pleasure.
Even the soldiery were permitted to disband for
the occasion, so secure seemed all around.
But what was the cause of all this excess of
joy among the proud inhabitants of Burgos
Why all this noise of mirth'~-these sounds of
sweet music-these illuminated streets, this total
abandonment of all order, discipline and caution
It was the eve of the birthday of Abderabman's
only chikl, Zulare.-'-the eve of the eighteenth
birthday of the beautiful maiden ~nlare. Never
had daystawned on morelovely daughter Nev-
er had proud father greater reason to celebrate,
with pomp and splendor, the anniversary of his
child's birth.
The palacee was thronged with myrhsds of
those who had come to do the homage at the
shrine of Zulare's beauty, and none went away
without winning a smile from her~-a smile nev-
er to be forgotten.
Roderigo made his way to the city with all
despatch. On arriving within the walls, he be-
came Wonder-struck itt what he saw. Instead of
an armed people, he beheld Joy and festivities
reigning supreme. Indeed, he dared hardly
credit his senses; but at last, not appreciating
the full certainty of what was passing about him,
he ventured to ask an old Ethiopian slave whom
he met, what the occasion could be that produc-
ed so much felicity in the city?
"flost not know, my lord," he replied, "that
this is the birthright of the viceroy's daughter,
Zulare ?"
6

"Indeed," rejoined the Castilian in disguise;
"well, why do all the people thus partake of the
enthusiasm?"
"0 master, master, didst thouknow how very
beautiful is the daughter of the governor, thou
surely wouldst never ask me this ?" was the old
man's reply.
"Zulare Is then beautiful."
"Beautiful as heaveu-hast thou never seen
her ?"
"Nay, I have but now entered the city from
a long journey; but I would fain witness those
charms which cost a whole city so much pains."
"I'll lead thee to the palace, master," said
the slave.
"First lead me to some well-filled bazaar,
where I can change these unseemly garments,
that I may make some- fair appearance in the
presence of this princess of beauty."
"Follow me, then, good master; I'll lead
thee to one straightway in the very route to the
palace~"
"Thou art a good dog."
"Nay, master, I am no dog; though the Span-
iards call the Moors all dogs. I am no Moor."
"Nay, thou art worse, being a Moor's slave."
By this time the Ethiopian had brought Rode-
rigo to the entrance of a large bazaar, such as
is not seen in many countries at this day, but
which, in earlier times, were the only marts for
traflin.
"Remain here until I come," said Roderigo
to the slave. "I will go in and procure me
vestments fitted for the occasion, and will then
return, that you may lead me to the palace."
Rederigo passed into the pavilion, where all
was busy life, happiness and gayety. A short
time sufficed to select a proper garb in which to
array himself, and which, when donned, evinced
by its richness and beauty that the wearer was
no common personage.
Reflecting upon the great risk of his under-
taking, that of seeking an ent~ into the pal-
ace of the very ruler whom liMed come to de-
stroy, Roderigo deemed it best to assume afhar-
acter as near that of his real one as practil~able,
in order to avoid suspicion. It was with this
consideration that he chose that of a prince of
Gaul, the part which he so well knew how
to act.
It is unnecessary to describe the gorgeous
richness of the apparel which Roderigo put upon
himself in the bazaar. Those who are acquaint-
ed with the costumes of that day will readily cost-

ceive the noble appearance which Roderigo
made; being a prince whose natural ~nd una-
domed charms were sufficient to win their way
to the deep recesses of admiration,
Having therefore fully completed his toilet,
Roderigo sallied forth from the bazaar, and fol-
lowing the honest lead of the old African, soon
found hims~tlf at the gate of the palace.
The throngs were still pouring in and issuing
from the vast enclosures, and it was with dliii-
culty that our hero could effect an entrance into
the palace. At length, however, he succeeded,
and, bor~ie along with an irresistible tide pass-
ing in, he soon found himself in a spacious sa-
e loon most gorgeotisly lighted, richly adorned
with all the splen4tirs that the East could have
produced.
Following the crowd onward, Iloderigo soon
came into the vicinity of the circle of chief attrac-
lion, and with an effort, disengaged himself from
the throng, and withdrew to a more secluded
position, but yet, where he might witness all that
passed before his eyes.
From this position, Roderigo could easily dis-
tinguish the great Moor, Abderabman, as he
sat upon his richly carved throne of ivory. But
his eyes wandered for the inimitable loveliness
of the viceroy's daughter-Zulare.
Whilst thus engaged, an omeer of the house-
hold came to him, saying thea his master having
observed him, and perceived by his majestic ap-
pearance and costly apparel that he must be of
noble birth, desired him to approach the place
where he sat in state.
This was a compliment not particularly ac-
ceptable to Roderigo, but well knowing the sus-
picion thatwoeld inevitablyattach tohim if he de-
clined so distinguished a mark of favor, he re-
adjusted his dagger in his bosom, and suffered
himself to be led to the 'foot of the throne.
"I greet thee, noble stranger," said the great
Moor, as R~4ujgo camei near to him; "thou
art welcome Wur' court; and forasmuch as
thou art a prince of Gaul, thou art doubly
welcome."
"I thank thee, my lord," answered Roderigo.
"Thou art journeying through these regions,
4oubsless, for thy pleasure; certainly no mission
from thy nation bringeth thee into these remote
s~onntries."
"jt is most true, my lord, I am here upon my
.~wn account, since I bring neither message nor
Ji5~~tA of power with me."
"MIeast thou shouldst have sent us word be-

fore thee, that we might have given thee a re-
ception befittIng the future king of a great
country."
"Nay, my lord, no courier could have out-
sped my course, so eager was I to arrive in time
to participate in the pleasing fete now surround-
ing me."
"It is well, prince; the vigor of youthfulness
snuffs beauty from afar, and seeks to honor it
too, when found."
"It is true, my lord; the fame of thy daugh-
ter's beauty is not new to me, and it was to hon-
or her that I have thus made my uncou*t~y
presence before thect."
"Thou hast not yet seen her, prince; tarry
here one moment, she shall be brought hither?"
Abderahman here nodded to an attendant,
who stood near, and having heard the conversa-
tion between his master and Roderigo, under-
stood, consequently, ~the interpretation of the
gesture.
"Thou shalt see the loveincss of Spain, Afri-
ca and Asia comprised into one human form,
when thine eyes fall upon Zulare," said the
proud governor.
"I doubt it not, my lord," ansWered Roderigo;
and before he had time to qualify his assent to
the extravagant praise of the father, Zelaro ap-
proached him, led by a Moorish cavalier, whose
fierce countenance contrasted strongly with the
sweet, smiling warmth that beamed from the
unparalleled beauty of the maiden by his side.
"Zulare, my child, look on the young prince
of Gaul, who is here to honor thy birth-night."
modest greeting of the viceroy's daughter with
~Loderigo advanced a step and met the
marked respect and admiration. He now led
Zulare to a seat near by, where, in pleasant con-
verse the hours flew with a rapidity of which
the young pair were entirely ignorant.
It was plain to be discovered, that although
the young Spaniard had entered Castile to be-
come a conqueror, he was now in a fair way to
be con(luered in Castile. And though the fierce-
ly flashing eyes of the dark Bajazet fell jealously
upon the fair couple, they heeded it not.
"How sayest thou, thou likes not Ihe Span-',
iards ?" inquired Roderigo, after the conversa-
tion turned upon that conquered race.
"I like them not; they are too cruel; they
come and kill our people, and carry far away
our sisters and our mothers," was the artless
response.

"I know little of them," said Roderigo; "bu

"Yes, brave they are. I have heard my fath

"He must be an extraordinary warrior," sug
tested the courtier.
"0 yes; and is Ivithal, said to he a noble and
beautiful prince."
"Indeed," replied Roderigo, with some sur
prize; "who could have given thee this strange
information l"
"An old Ethiopian slave whom my father
purchased in Syria; he knew him when with the
Roman army in the East," was Zulare's answer.
"That must have been long since, as the
knight De Pelagio I think has not been in the
Roman service for many years."
"Thou knowest the Spanish prince, then,"
said the Moorish maiden, earnestly.
"I knew him well, Zulare, when his father
ruled this province under the Roman laws."
Roderigo began to grow ~tless under the
knowledge that there was a persoia~e of Ab-
derahman's household who knew him, ~he~fear-
ing lest hi~ incognito might be wrested fzom him,
he was more particular to inquire who the slave
was(and thus, perchance, learn to what extent
he risked his present adventure. His surprise
may be imagined when he learned that the old
slave of whom Zulare spoke, was no other than
h~ who had conducted Roderigo hither that very
evening. He was certain that he had not then
been recognized by old Nelsus, whose name he
recognized as soon as Zulare named it. There
was no certainty, however, that he would again
escape the old man's recognition if he should
once fairly set his gaze upon him; as, neither
before they bad sought the bazaar, nor after-
wards had an opportunity been afforded him to
see the features of Roderigo. There was another
reason why Roderigo deSired to know more of
theold Ethiopian; for very sure he was, if that
pet-sonage wah'no more honest and loyal to his

The night was wearing away rapidly, and as
yet Roderigo had obtained no information of suf-
ficient importance to warrant him in coming to
any conclusion as to the course necessary to
pursue. Old Nelsus had informed him that the
whole Moorish armywere temporarily disbanded

The morning sun rose brightly over the city 1
of Burgos. The third day of the carnival had '~
arrived.
*      *      *      *       *
It was a busy day in the camp of Roderigoand
his followers. Every preparation was now being I
made for the premeditated attack upon the
Moors within the city, and although Roderigo
had intended to postpone the attack until at
least the last night of the viceroy's fete, yet the I
circumstances which had transpired on the pre-
vious evening he was well aware must preclude
any further intercourse with the city, evenshoul4
Old Nelsus2not reveal the secret.
Taking counsel, therefore, with his lieuten-
ants, and particularly with Bragauza, Roderigo
laid before them all his plans, the location of the
city, the position of the palace, and to each com-
mander gave express instructions as to his par-
ticular duty. To Bragauza he assigned the at-
tack on that part of the palace in which Abderah-
man slept, whilst he would take under the charge
of- his own eye the capture of the beautiful
and loved Zulare.
Thus were all things made in complete read-
iness, and Roderigo and his friends only waited
for the coming of night to strike a blow for love
and Castile.
*      *      *      *      *
The first shade of evening was slowly draw-
ing its thin veil over the distant valleys, and the
bright rays of the departing sun were disporting
themselves like the phosphorescent glow of the
ocean upon far-off Castilian peaks. The hour
was fast approaching when the prayers of mil-
lions of the f~thful followers of the prophet
would ascend To Allah-from those whose faces
would he upturned toward the Moslem temple at
Mecca.
Motionless and mute sat Zulare, gazing upon
the wonderful scene of the day's close. Her
eyes wandered for a moment far away over the
plain, until as it were the sight was lost in dark-
ness. They were then directed in a contrary di-
rection-taking in the wide extended range of

scattered prayerfully on the breeze of evening,
and wafted toward the shrine of the faithful.
The assault of the Spanish forces was tumul-
tuous and skilful; the defence of the Moors was
desperate and wild. The army, under Roderi-
go, made no halt, and that of Abderahman
sounded no parley. The battle began and rag-
ed fiercely, at the same moment. From the fort-
resses flew the javelins and arrows in tempes-
tuous clouds. From the besiegers, the cata-
pult discharged its ponderous stones, and on
both sides the deadly sword performed its oft-
repeated havoc. The clashing of steel against
steel, the ponderous stroke on buckler and shield,
made wild the music of the evening zephyr, and
thousands fell beneath them to rise no more.
The battle raged with utmost fury, while the
last streak of light remained to gladden the eye,
'or to direct the stroke, and so continued with
hideous results, even into the darkness of the

battle, at least, in flight to secure his daughter.
He therefore directed his steps toward~he palace,
followed by his immediate guards arid officers.
What heart can appreciate thu ~anguish of that
father, when, on arriving at the palace, he heard
the terrible news of his daughter's capture, and
her conveyance away! The distant din of battle
as it loudly resounded through those ancient
palace walls, was all unheard by him. The full
flush of his cheeks departed, and, statue-like, he
stood as one amused at some awful event, with-
out distinctly understanding its true character.
*     This state was, however, but momentary.
Gathering up all the energies of his natuv4, the
vaultdd passages and apartments of the castle
resounded with the awful imprecations upon the
anthors of this misery from his lips; and then
loudly calling upon his faithful guards surround-
lug, to fallow him, Abderahman rushed away
like a meteor in a dark sky, to renew the ter-
rors of the battle.
*              The horrors of the niglft became now doubly
terrible, as the report spread wildly and fast
among the Moslem ranks that the viceroy's
daughter was made prisoner, and would, unless
rescued, fall into the embraces of a barbarous
prince whose religion was worse than that ol
Paganism.
Hour after hour the scene of frightful wai
was visible in the ancient city, until the da~
dawned again upon the surrounding plain. Ther
what a' sight was there to be seen! The living
Obtistian and Moor still engaged in terrific strife
whilst the dead and dying Spaniard and Moslen
lay in rugged heaps about the now ensanguinet
streets.
Bat this, like all desperate encounters, wa
destined to have an end. The prowess of Rode
rigo and~is troops had proved superior to the
of the M6ors. It was whilst Roderigo was at
gaged in what appeared to be the last desperate
effort necessary to complete'~his victory, that h
saw his chief antagonist approaching at the hea
of his guard-the flower of the Moorish host.
The quick eye of Abderabman at once caugl
the towering form of Roderigo, and goaded on h
despair and anguish, at once rushed forward
encounter the young knight.
Roderigo proved ready for the assault. ~
pen can describe the angry contest which no
ensued between the leaders of the opposing a
mies. Even the battle around them seemed
subside; both parties desiring to witness ti
awful scene, as the fate of empire settled upe

the points of those two terrible sabres. At Iest~
the youthful vigor of Roderigo proved superior
over both the age and skill of Abderabman, and
the latter fell to the earth. Then it iVas that a
terrific contest ensued between the two fractions
of the armies, as to who should bear the fallen
chief from the field. Roderigo's forces fought
for a distinguished prisoner; Abderaliman's for
preservation'from disgrace. Victory once more
came to the Christian arms, and the Moslem
crew fled in confusion before their Spanish foes..
Thus closed th~ battle ofiBurgos. The vic-
torious Roderigo now conveyed the fallen cap-.
tive, Abderahmaii, under a heavy escort to a
place of safety, and prepared at once to pro-
claim the end of Moslem rule in Castile.
CHAPTER IV.
Weeks passed by after the stirring events nar-
rated in the preceding chapter, and the house of'
Felaglo again held sway over its native Castile.
Abderabman became a closely confined prisoner
within the very city and palace where he had
once ruled the undisputed master. Zulare was
likewise a captive, but the rigor of captivity with
her was relieveA by the warm love of Roderigo,
as it was daily poured forth at the shrine of her
beauty.
It is said, and with truth too, that love over-
cometh aU scruples. The tender treatment re-
ceived by Zulare from Roderigo, and those sur-
rounding her, together with her former true
feelings toward the young knight, all tended to

sage home. There were several ships at the
Point, but they were all going arou$ to Ca~ton,~,
and thus three weeks passed ~wity without any
siga of the chance I sought. At length I learn-
ed .that there was a Spanish brig downat Ran-
gafalia which was bound for the Mediterranean,,
and knowing that if I could be landed atjiibral-
tar I could easily get a passage from thence, ~
resolved to go down and see the captain of the
brig. To this end I hired a boatman to take me
down the river, and having got all my luggage
together I set off. I found the brig anchored off
the northern point of Sugar Island. Her cap-
tain was a Spaniard, but spoke the English lan-
guage well. He was a tall, pale looking man,
with the strangest black eye I ever saw. It
seemed to be a cold, icy eye, shooting forth sharp
rays of light that possessed a sort of freezing
power. I asked him if he was bound for the
Mediterranean, and he told me yes. I then ask-
ed him if he could give me a passage as fai~ as
Gibrnlta't~, at the same time stating the circum-
stances under which I had beenleft behind by my
ship. At first he was unwilling to answer me.
After thinking for a few moments he called some
of his officers one side and conversed with them
in a tone too low for me to hear; yet I cofild see
that the discussion was quite animated, and that
there were differences of opinion upon the sub.
ject. At length the captain turned to me again
"What is your name I" he asked, very coolly
and at the same time eyeing me sharply.
"John Barclay," returned I.           -
"Well, Mr. Barclay, do you think you car
keep a secret l"
"I think I have followed the sea long enough
to understand the value of such a trait as that,'
returned I, without hesitation.
"Well, then," returned he, "I will tell you
that we sometimes lay ourselves liable to thi
penalties of the revenue laws."
"Smugglers," said I.
"Yes-exactly," responded he, with a sort o
cold smile about the corners of his mouth. "W
do considerable in that line, and you must o
course know that we wouldn't stop at any 01
diary measures to secure ourselves against
betrayal."
I well knew the meaning of that~ remark-
knew that my life would answer for my secrecy
but I had determined to go, and I would n
now be put back. I had laid too long already
ujon my oars, and as there waS likely to be ~
ether chance for some time to come, I resolve

to take up with the present one at all hazards.
If they could turn a penny by smuggling, and
were willing to run all the risks, why, it was
none of my business. They did not defraud me,
or my government. So I told the captain I
ould go with him, and pay him what was right.
My luggage was accordingly brought on board,
and I was allowed a berth in the cabin. I could
see that there was some dissatisfaction on the
part of the other officers, but they yielded to the
decision of their commander.
On the following morning the brig got under-
weigh and passed out through the eastern chan-
nel. She was a staunch craft, of about three
hundred toTus burden, with raised quarter-deck,
and with no house upon it. Her cabin was well-
furnished and had six berths,-the captain and
three of his officers took up four of them; I
took the fifth, and the sixth was unoccupied.
The brig's crew consisted of about forty men,
more than half of whom came on board after I
had taken my berth. They were stout, rough
looking fellows, though they would compare well
with the average~ of ships' crews. The captain's
name I found to be Modiego, and I never before,
nor have I since, witnessed such perfect disci-
pline as there was on board that brig. Modiego
* could speak with his eyes, and I never saw a
* man disobey them.
On the third day out I found that some of the
crew were making arrangements to set up the
cook's range in the fore-peak, and after the cu-
linary implements were all removed thither, the
galley, which had been standing amidships, was
taken to pieces. This movement was of course
strange to me, but there was a stranger scene in
store. This galley had a floor to it, and when
this floor was removed 1 saw a circular railway
of iron, in the centre of which was a massive
steel pivot. Once or twice I found Modiego's
eye fixed searchingly upon me, but if he thought
to read my emotions in my face he was much
*f mistaken, for few men possess more control over
a their features than I do. Yet I was glad that I
f had noticed the captain's look, for it placed me
on my guard.
it After the deck was cleared of the last vestige
of the galley, sheers were rigged over the main
.1 hatch, and in half an~hour afterwards a long,
heavy Ikass gun had been hoisted out frora the
)t hold and placed upon the afore-mentioned pivot.
y "We smugglers need something for protee-
0 tion," quietly reniarked the captain, as he ap-
d preached me after the gun was rigged.

"0, certainly," said I, with a smile. "I
wondered before that I saw no implements for
such. a purpose."
Modiego gave me a. searching look, but he
found nothing but honesty in my countenance.
"Yes," he uttered, "we are obliged to be pre-
pared for emergencies, for our'a is a dangerous
business."
I believed him! And I began., to wish that I
had not been in quite so much of a hurry to se-
cure my passage. But it was too late now-I
had forced myself into the plight, and Ihad only
to make the best of it. Of course I had begun
to think that my companions were men who
smuggled at both ends of the bargain-that the
revenue was not the only institution against
which their hands were raised.
For fourteen days the brig kept on her course
to the south'rd and west'rd, and dui~ing.that time
I had been on very fair terms with the officers,
though none of them beesned inclined to famil-
iarity. Once or twice I thought the captain
seemed inclined to make some overture to me,
but whatever may have been upon his mind he
kept itto himself. On~hemorningofthefifteenth
day I heard an unusual bustle upon deck, and
on going up I found that the tarpaulin had been
taken from the long gun, and that the men were
bringing small arms up from below. Modiego
was at the starboard rail with his telescope to his
eye. I looked in the direction indicated by his
glass a~d saw a ship not more than four or five
miles distant. She was evidently a merehans-
man, and bound up the ocean. Modiego at
length lowered his glass, and as he turned he
saw me.
"~Al~-Mr. barclay," he said, showing not
the leapt hesitation, "you had better go below,
for we are likely to have business that may not
be agreeable to you."
This order was not to be mistaken, and sim-
ply bowing an acquiescence, I turned and went
back to the cabin. I will not attempt to tell
what were my feelings at that moment. Of
course I knew now that I bad taken passage in
a pirate, and I ouly wondered that I had been
allowed so so do; but I subsequently learned,
from a conversation that I overheard, that Mo-
diego had allowed me to remain on board through
fear that I might be the meanS of exciting sus-
picion against him' if he sent me off. It seemed
that he feared that if I told the officers on shore
of his refusal to take me, that it might, in some
way, subject him to an examination, at least.

So he thought it best to take me, and, if I was
Jikelyrto pro~ei~dangerous passenger, to dispose
ofmeinamethod c - toindividuala of
their profession.
When I reached tire cabin I seatedmyself near
tl~e ~W'le and itwaited the result. My feelings
were~4~ious and changing. I had sorrow, die-
hppointment, regret, and anger, though I think
that the latter emotion was the most prominent.
In fifteen minutes I felt the shock of our long
gun. Then itboomedagain-.-and again. Then
I heard the~voice of Captain Modiego ashe call-
ed away his boarders; All was now bustle over
my head. I heard the rattle of the small arms
as they were being distributed, and the clanking
of the grappling chains as they were dragged
over the deck. Next I felt a shock that came
nigh throwing me from my seat-and fluew
that the vessels had come together. ~[ expected
to have heard loud, fiendish yells of onset, but
in this I was mistaken. I heard Modiego give
the order for boarding, and then I heard the
sharp cracking of musketry. Now my blood
was up, and at the head of a dozen good men I
would have attacked the pirates with a good rel-
ish. I could. hear the groans of those who were
wounded, and now that the heat ~f battle had
loosened the restraint of subordination, I could
hear the yell of the pirates. But the conflict
soon ceased, and then I knew that the p~rases
were overhauling the ship's cargo.
At the end of two hours the ship was allowed
to proceedon her way, and shortly afterwards
Modiego was assisted down into the cabin by
two of his officers. He had received a musket
ball in his thigh, but he would notleave the deck
until he had seen the ship off.
"I shall soon get over is," ~ heard him say,
as his bearers settled him rpon a stool. And
then noticing me, he added, "Ah, Barclay, wish
you'd go on deck and lend a hand at stowing
~away some of our poor chaps that have been
served with the same sauce I've got. We bad a
short fight, but 'twas a hard one. Them Yan-
kees did us more damage with their first musket.
ry than leould have believed. Buttheysuffered
for it. San Pedro I but this thing hurts."
I stopped not to hear more, or to niake any
answer to what I had heard, but hastened at
once on deck, where I fo~ind part of the erew
engaged in lowering various boxes ~nd bales in-
to the hold, while near the wheel I saw several
small iron-bound oaken boxes that I knew to be
filled with specie. On forward I found the dead

and wounded, and of course I len~ ~vhet assist-
ance I could towards alleviating ufferingsbf
the~ penr wretches, a et I did it with a'bad
grace, fos'.their men were filled with coarse
oaths, and they writhed~1lkq eowards~under th
torture. There were five of the~-prateMlUed~
and eight of them badly wounded; ~UI4it0s8
who escaped unharmed thought themselves -well
paid for the loss they had sustained, for theyhad
token over seventy thousand dollars in specie,
besides a large quantity of valuable merchan-
dize.
From this time forth I resolved to b$ng the
villains to punishment if possible. It was a
dubious hope, but yet I cherished It. I was
alone against two score of hardened villains,
and with no means of succor at hand. And,
moreover, 1 knew~ that ifiost of them distrusted
me. It i~as at this time that I heard the conver-
sation to which I have already alluded-where
I learned that I hadbeen allowed to take a pas-
- ~sage in the brig withthe probabilitythatlshould
not live to finish it.
Modiego had had the ball extracted from his
thigh, but the wound threatened to be a danger-
* ous one, for the leg had swelled, and there was
every appearance of mortification. But yet he
*lingeftd on for two months without leaving his
cabin, and to this may be attributed the fact that
the pirates attacked no other vessels. During
this time I had devoted every mental energy to
the studying up of some plan by which to carry
out my wishes, and at length I hit ugon the only
thing that seemed to la~ within the range of
possibility.
We were now in the vicinity of the Capede
Verds, and I knew that if anything was to be
done it must be aone quickly, for I felt sure that
thoplate of putting an end to my life was freely
discussed, and favorsblyentertained by the crew.
* As length the time for my trial eame, and I had
fully resolved to stake my life in the hazard.
One day, towards noon, a thick mist began to
* arise on the water that came in with a westerly
wind; but it did not prevent the officer getting
an observation' of the sun, which found us to be
in latitude 14 degrees 44 minutes north, and the
longitude 18 degrees west. I knew now we were
directly opposite. Cape Verde, and notfar from
fifty miles distant. By two o'clock theweather
was quit. thick, and the wind veered a little to
the southward. At tburo'cloek there were some
indications of a stormna and the officers wore all

on deck. I went down into the cabin and found
the captain asleep. In a small chest lashed un-
der the table were two spare compasses, one ex-
aetly like that in the~binnacle. This compass I
took out. It had a copper bowl, and the rim
that held the glass top was fastened onbyascrew.
I took the rim off and took outthe card. Then
I concealed the small box in which the whole
hung beneath my bedding, keeping only thecard
by me.' I listened a moment to be assured that
all was safe, and then I took my pocket-knife
and loosened the magnetic needle~om the hot-
tom of the card. The course through the night
I knew would be nearly due north, so! swung
the needle round until the magnetic point was
directly under that point of the cardindieatedby
N. W. by W. This brought the north point of
the card around to N. E: by B., so that were the
brig to besteered by that compass as I had fixed
it, and her head kept where the compass indicat-
ml north, she would in reality be going N. B. by
B. I secured the needle to the card again by
means of a little wax, and having placed is back
in the bowl and screwed the top on again, I hid
the whole oace more in my bed.
And now the most difficult part of the task
was to come. I must exchange compasses with
the binnacle; and how wits this to be done when
the helmsman's eye was never off from the spotl
But my life had been pledged, and I took cour-
age; and I should have surely Ihiled had not a
lucky idea come. to my assistance. I took the
compass from my berth ana put it back into the
chest from whence I had first taken it, and then
I nervously waited for the moment when I could
carry my plan into execution.
The night caine on dark ae4 early. 'Not a
star was so be seen, and the atmosphere had
grown damp and cold. As soon as it was fairly
dark I possessed myself of small, single block
I found in the stern-boat, and then I moved'cau-
tiously about the' deck-anywhere to escape ob-
servation. At eight o'clock the watch was
changed~ but before the 'off-watch went below
the officer concluded to take a reef in' the top-
sails, so as so be on the safe side incase of a
blow. Pr~videace seemed to be with me, for at
that moment the wind began to veer to the
westward.
"Stand by the braces!" shouted the officer;
and as he gave the order I could see the dusky
thrins of the 'men U, they moi~ed through the
thick darkness.
