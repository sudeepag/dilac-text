compactly built up ~n both sides. The
streets cross each other at right angles.
The circle of hills which we have already
mentioned, exte    t~ ~l~e1iverr~ ti's
east and westjt e     $~h4~ di~netei~
will give some idea of the space occupied
by the city. All this space, with the
exception of a small portion on the
western plat, where the ground is low
and subject to inundation from the
fre~b~ e~ i1~r4k ~to~S.~erfl4i#~ its.
banks, is filled up. The hills which skirt
the city are somewhat remarkable for
their regularity of outline, rising up
the height of three hundred feet. Over

ITS MYSTERIES
known to him; he knew him as a reckless
gambler, but as nothing else.3 In fact~,
he had often searched in vain for the
source from whence Ilowed his friend's
inexhaustible wealth. He had noticed
that at times his companion was almost
destitute, and at others he would be in
possession of funds more than equal to
his demands; yet not one 'suspicion
crossed him of the other's secret con-
nection.
Gus, or the captain, as he wes called
here, immediately called up the party
beside the bar and ordered 'the best the
house afforded for hini~elf and friends.
This time Hartkins drew from beneath
his counter a long, black battle,, which
was soon emptied of it~ contents, and
pronounced "A No, I" by all, with the~
exception of Paddy Q'Murphy, who in
all cases preferred the genuine "extract
of rye er corn-stalk~" After this they
drew their seats around the table, and
the captain commenced lAs explanation,
which, for the sake of brevity, w~. will
omit, merely giving some of its leading
features.
It appears that a young man who was
engaged as a clerk ix~ one of the fashion-
able retail esLahlishments on Fourth
street, had, like, many others, been
drawn into one of, those "fashionable
places of amusement," alias billiard
saloons, and had imbibed a taste for
gaming, which soon led him into other
and more serious places of resort. Now,
we do not wish to be understood' as
emphatically condemning this kind of
amusement, for the game of billiards, in
itself is harmless and s~piple enough.'. In
fact, it is so simple that we cannot for,
the world determine why men of intelU-
gence engage in it~, We would considerr
it,~for our part, quitq73as creditable to sit

it should give employment to tllQse who
are unfit for anything else. such w~
would'. recommend tp keepers of men-
ageries, as fit persons to '~stir up ~4ie
monkeys with long poles." But, to
speak candidly, why; can't our young
men~ and old ones, too, establish some
rational and healthy amusement? By
using the necessary exertions, associa-
tions might easily be for-roed, which
would prove a source of great advantage
as well as gratification to those who
desire to avail themselves of such a
privilege. We have, however, been
guilty .of a digression, and must retnru.
The young man of whom we. L~ve
been'speaking, having been robbed (for
we~ ~can use no nlilder teI~ni):'6f all he
honestly possessed in thei ~~world, 'was
tempted by a plan which the fiend of
darkness whispered in his ear,' by which
he might regain his losses. It was to
rob his employers, and win back from
his more fortunate~frien4s; that which,
by some sudden change of luck, had been
taken from him, Desperate as the deed
seemed at first to be, he at last deter-
mined to do it. At the hour of mid-
night, while his confiding employ~~s and
fellow clerks were asleep, h~ stole noise-
lessly to the safe and extracted a small
sum, so that its absence might not be
so easily noticed, and oi~ce more returned
to the gaming 'table; but, instead of r~-
coveringwhat he hadlost, he squandered
tl~at, for which he ha4 sacrificed his
honor, and damned his soul forever.
Tl~en his friends, who wer~ evidently
solicitous forhis welfare, informed hi~
that he had placed himself completelyy
within their grasp that thoughts'of escape
were useless; and unless he immedii~t~1'y

scene            chapter.  Beir~g some-

of' th'~ city, It is generally lOoked upon
a~ a 'very qidet section, and, in conse-
4iien~e, de~iirab1e as a place of residence.
Like most of 'the Streets in the city, it is
~dry'narrow, but regulari' Ittid out, and
cont~iit's ~ excellent buildings.
The queen O~ty, among her disadvan-
tages, has none to be regi'~tted more
than the spa~e limited for her ~th@o'iigh-
far~s. In this the original propi~i~tors
committed ~ grievous blunder, for which
posterity Will 4not soon forgive them. It

co~rp6l:ation pay "a good round sum,'7 not
see~iA~ to regard the comfort and
conVenience of purcl~asers in the least.
The u~iia1 width of the principal streets
and avenues is sixty feet, with the isolat-
ed exception of Broadway, which, bear-
ing a name indicative of its character,
could not be otherwise, without a palpable
display of inconsistency. But this, even,
loses its distinction in a few squares, and
is reduced to an equality with the others.

If' our citizenss continue to improve the
character of their buildings, by the
ereetio~a of such princ~ly edY~ces as may
be found On 'some of ~nr prihoipal busi~~
nO~s streetssunshine will, in the course of
time, be greatly in demand. Pearl street
may be cited as 'an evidehee of this fact.
l~ein'g the great mart of the heavy whole~
mile trade of the city, it is, with few
exceptions, built up with large and costly
buildings. A walk through it during one
of those damp, unpleasant days, so com~
mon in this section of the Union,' will
convince~ any reasonable person that
narrow streets, shut out from the light
by five and six story buildings, are not
by any means desirable, or 'conducive to
health or comfort. An effort has been
made Within the past few years to improve
th&amp; streets, by introducing bowiders
taken from the bed of the Ohio river, in
lieu of the square stones quarried from
the hill side, with which' they" ~were
previously paved. 2These 'round stones
make a vastly mqre ~Iurable and smoother
pavement than the broken stone; and
were the streets rCgularl'y'~#e~t, as they
are in sonic of the Eastern cities, during
the night-a project less expensive than
that of watering them-the difficulties
would, to a great degreee, be obviated,
and a resilience in' the Olty would be niade
thereby much more desirable.
With these remarks we return 5 our
story.. The home of Mr~. Wilson was
situated 'upon Kemble street, which we
have before spoken of. Mrs. Wilson
Was a~ widow who had seen much of
sorrow, and who had long been "the
victim of that much-dr~a'ded and fatal
dishes~, ~nisumptio~, ~hieh'is daily car-
rying th6usmids aw'ay in its resisifess
course. BesidOs this, ~he had another,
not tess to be feared ddversary-whieh
seemed to cling to her with equal tenacity

~poverty. Mr. Wilson had long strug-
gled against the~ ~ll, but her time had
Come, and she lay ~r~on hei death-bed.
She had two ~hildtefl - a son and
daughter. The son, 'who was named
Thomas, ormorefamiliarly called" Tom,"
Was a youth of nearly twenty yeats'.
and beside being of a robust and hearty
constitutkn, was possessed of a more than
ordinary share of niental power, which
only lacked proper cultivation, in order
that it might develop itself. But Tom,
like many others, had faults, had some
of them very grievous ones in the bargain.
Naturally of an ardent aud agreeable
disposition, his inclinations often led him
into habits that were contrary to what his
better nature told him was right. In
short, 4'om was all that a Cincinnati
"fireman" could be-he loved all the
pretty girls; he loved "dA~ machine;"
and, more than all, he loved the "cray-
thur," as an Irishman would say. With
this latter single exception, who could
blame him!-for if there was such a thing
as a true heart, in every sense of the
word, to be found in the bosom of man,
then we might'truly say that Toni Wilson
possessed it. Yet, although we said
that Tom lovCd all the pretty ~girls, we
did not intend to intimate that each
shared equally his thought. Oh, no,
'Porn had his "sweetheart," his "lady-
lov~," and least the readei~ should get
out of patience~ with us for keening him
or her so long in suspense, we will just
hint or intimate - no we wont! so
exercise a little control over your curio-
sity, and we promise you shall be in-
formed in sufficient time. Adelaide, the
daughter, waS at the time we speak of,
near the age of fourteen years, and post
messed a form as faultless as can be easily
~sonceived, and as amiable and sWeet B
dispssitien as e'er hecaine a beauty like

hers. Adelaide was a good girl in every'
sense of the word. Kind and generous~
hearted, industrious and Intelligent, she:
neVer kneW a friend but that they loved
her. By her unceasing toil with the
needle, she was enabled, now that ~her
poor mother was sick and unable to
labor, to procure a bare subsistence.
Tom, owing to his dissipated habits, 1jtgs
of little service to the others; but, to his
credit be it said, if he was of no advan~
tage, 'he did not make himself in any~
respect a burden or disadvantage. tlis
time was generally spent away from
home, among his boon comrades. Yet
he loved his mother and sister dearly,
and often cursed the day that ho first
was induced to touch the fatal wino CE~p
which had made him so miserable and'
worthleSS a person as he well knew he
was. Yet the first step had been taken~
and the others speedily follow~d. There
was one thing that troubled the min4
of Tom Wilson more' than' all others~
This Was his' loVe affair. Tom, much
as he loved his motherand sister, could
not help nourishing a passion for one
other person, and this had gained such
a perfect cOntrol over him, that no place
seemed to fill his soul 'with such inex-
pressible feelings of happiness, as when
in the presence of:his dearly beloved
and daily worshiped sweetheart!'
Yet Tom knew that he was doing
wrong, and lived constantly in the fear
that Sally ~- there~ we have said it!
but never mind, since we have uninten~
ti&amp;nally "let the cat out of the wallet,"
we will try no longer to hide her name

~fashionable costume and house-furnishing

this large establishment is conducted
with the precision of clock-work; and it
is continually thronged by ladies who
are waited upon by a &amp;et of as polite and
gentlemanly cler'l~s as can be found any-
where.
There is a large class of persons, of
both sexes, who make it a ma1~er of
necessity t~ be ~een for 't certain length
of time on the tractss each day. To
them, it appears to be a sao~ed duty, and
one niight think that the destiny and

great offense to certain characters in, 'the
city; but this shall, by no means deter
us from doing what we consider to be
Qi~r duty.' There is need of reform in
this city; and, we are sorry to say, ,few
measures have been taken, to bring such
an event about. A glance at one morn-
ing's report of the proceedings in our
Police Court, will satisfy any person
who is at all skeptical on the subject of
crime in the %~ueen City. New York
has been freed from some Qf its most
dreaded resorts of crime by a missionary
or reform movement; why may not such
the case' in Cincinnati? It is well
known that there are some dens of infamy
in this city which will challenge any
other city in the United States to produce
an equal. Let the press speak out freely
upon the subject, and we may expect ~
favorable response from the people.
In conclusion, we would say that we

Suddenly a bright gla~e~ 'preceded by
a dense ~ro1ume of heavy, dark smoke6
is seen, which is, followed in turn by a
sound of cracking flames, and a. noise
resembling much the distant sound of
thunder. 'Soon shouts and screams are
heard, and fro~n a number of low, black,

from the assembled crowd ~nnouncos

brief time is occupied in getting ready to
play upon the burning buildings, the fire
in which is discovered to have made
such headway that it is impossible to
save them, and their exertions are con-
fined to preserving those immediately
surrounding them.
Among those who had the honor of
manning the "first engine on the ground,"
is a young fellow, possessing a flue form
an4 regular features, who seems to be
one of the most energetic of the company.
Hatless and costless he stood up~~.a

a pipe which seemed to do good execution,

had not acted the part of a brother in

was changed-.-'gretit4y changed. Her
features were pale, and deeply marked
with rigid lines, that~at once told of the
immense sufferings she had undergone.

reply.
The girl crossed the room, and opened
the door which admitted the young
ganihler.~
There was b~it little alteration observe~
ble in the external appearance of young
Pembroke, save that his features were
somewhat flushed with protracted dissi-
pation, '~ His manner and bearing was
niarked with the same plar~sibility as of
old, and he seemed to have only become
the ijiore,' hardened and callous toward
the better feelings of human nature, by
a few month's experience.
-' ":Mr. Pembroke seems to have chosen
a somewhat unseasonable hour for an
evening call,' inet'hink's," was the saluta-
tion of the girl, as ~he ~pointed the young
man to a seat, and seated herself upon
the 6t.toman from which she had arisen
upon his entrance.
"1 must' admit that you are correct,"
answered the other; "but the urgency
of 'my 'business must answer as my
apology."
"' Indeed! and may I ask if it c6n~
c~,rns me? and if so, what its import
ml~y be ?" 'asked Agnes,' in' a~n eager
tone.
"It does, and is this: I saw Gus this
afternoon, and he expressed to me hi~
true sentiments in regard to you. He
said that he was sorry for and repented
of'the part which he bad taken against
you, and was willing now to make all
the reparation in his power, and-"
"Did he - did' Gus Williams say
this?" interrupted the girl, her pale fea~
tures instantly lighting up with' a mingled
expression of hope and anxiety, while
her dark eyes beamed with an unwanted
luster.

Wilson wa~ excited to a frightful degree. He was now convinced that his sister was in the hands
of a villain, and he dreaded lest she had already become his victim I With one bound he leaped into

"Hell and furies 1" shouted Gus,
leaping' suddenly to his feet, "yon do
not ~iiean~ to say that she is aware of my
intended' marriage with Miss Henley?"'
"Exabtly so," answered 'Pembroke;
"and, moreover, sh~ is determined to
prevent it."
Gus, for a few moments, did not speak,
but strode rapidly' to and fro across the
apartment, like one laboring under a fit
of insanity. His strong fram~swelled
~nd trembled with inward emotions,
whjle his brow':was o'ercast~. with a frown
as dark ds midnight. Gus was a person
who exei~cised but little control over his
darker passions, having ever allowed
them an entire sway' ~ver his actions.
At times he was m&amp;ose and gloomy;
and in these moods, no one who knew
him cared to cross him. In his' calm
moments he was extremely gay and
jovial, and nowhere could be found a
more agreeable companion than he. In
shoi't his life~w&amp;s a mystery - and one
which his most intimate companions were
unacquainted 'with. After pacing the
apartment for some time in silence, until
he accrued to have somewhat regained
his accustomed .composure, he paused
before young Pembroke, and said in a
'deep tone of voice
"Char1ey~ this girl must be silenced 1"
"So I have been thinking," replied
the other, "but h9w 'is it to be done?

"You are right-we must act at once.
For know, Charley, that I love the' gentle'
Eleanor as never before have I loved a
woman, for ~he is everything that is
pure and noble. Beside this, she has a
princely fortune, which, by my marriage,
will fall into my hands. I believe, my
boy, that if I should succeed in this in-
stance, I would quit my present habits,
and endeavor to become a respectable
ornament to society. What say you9"
"Well, it is all right enough for that
matter; as I do not believe that' a little
reformation at present could harm either
of us a great deal. But of this girl; what
do you intend to do ?"
"Why, as I said before, she must be
silenced. in some way or other, but I
cannot immediately determine how. I
wish you, after this, to keep a close
watch upon her actions, and if you find
that she really intends what she has said,
you can inform me of it. She shall not
stand in my way. If she drives me to
desperation, the consequences rest upon
her own head! Rather than relinquish
my claim, upon the hand and fortune of
Eleanor Henley. I would send her on a
journey to that bourne from whence there
is no return !"
"You surely would not murder her 1"
asked Pembroke, in a tone of astonish-
ment, for he
kne7 not thathis companion s

"I would kill my own father, if he

in a tone that caused the blood of the
young Virginian to curdle in his veins.

had made use ~f, he added, "Excuse

With this; the handsome gambler bade
his friend good morning, and, hastily~
made' his way to the 'street.

which is everywhere manifesting itself.
The nation is in a ferment of excitement

advertisements, or puffs of advertisers9
For twenty cents a line, groggeries,
gambling saloons, oyster cellars, thea.~
ters, etc., can be puffed to their heart's
content. This is the degradation of the
press. Many newspapers have mottoes
or declarations setting forth their object
to be~ the diffusion of useful and Chris-'
tian knowledge, and political informs..
tion; but which, in reality, are mere
mercantile bulletins, from the columns
of which little more is to be learned than
reading signs in the streets.
No country~ on earth, laboring undei~
our disadvantages, has a press as free
as our own; but, since it is unwise to
tolerate less than the best, where the
best may be bad, why can we not have
a press conducted by men. capable of~
writing' sensible articles for general pe-
b
rusal, in place of flooding the county
with badly printed newspapers, contain-
ing worse written articles, or filled up
with advertisements? The great object
in newspaper publications is the acquisi-
tion of money, and if this be accom-
plished, all is well. If the three t'iiou~
sand papers now published in the United
States, would devote, each week, one of
their papers to conveying to the peoplethe
rudiments of popular education, for one
year, a vast amount of good would be
done that will never be effected by the
course now pursued. Let any compe-
tent editor, for one year, devote even
one column to the geography of 'the
United States, and, in less than half th'e
time,' he will find himself surrounded
with a far more' enlightened community
than is usually found.

THE FOnTUNE-TELL~R AND HER MIS-

ING OITY-A SUI3JEUT FOR CONTEMPLA-
TION THE RESURRECTION MAN - HiS
MIDNIGHT VISITOR-THE PLANNING OF A
DESPERATE DEED.
"Midnight, o'er a sleeping city,
Has her, starry mantle cast;
And the pale moon's gentle radiance
Shineth o'er the grandeur vast."
A yaw evenings subsequent to the one
'upon~ which the interview between Gus
and the fortune-teller took place, as inti-
wated at' the' close of our sixteenth
chapter, the latter named individual paid
~ visit to 'the apartments of Agnes Mer-
ten. The unfortunate 'girl received her
coldly, for 'her presence was fai', from
being agreeable. This did not~ appear
to diseoucert l~tadam ~.' i~ the least,

for she was bent upon a mission of her
own, and cared but little about the' good
opinion and friendship of others, if her
own plans were~ forwarded. For Some
time her efforts to 'gain the attention of
the~ girl were ineffectual; but, at last, by
intimating that she was, through the
medium of her "art," acquainted with
the, circurn stances by 'which the othex'
was surrounded, they were crowned with
success.
Agnes was led 'to believe that if sh~
could secure the aid of Madam E., in
her' cause, her plans might be more
easily consummated. The fortune-teller
affected to be much interested in the
welfare of the girl, and freely promised
all the ~assistance that lay in her power,
and revealed to her many traits inth~
character of her betrayer with which shc~
was previously unacquainted. At thc
same time, she disclosed numerous in-
cidents of a private' character, which had
taken place during the intimacy of Agnes
and her pretended lover, that could not
have been known to a' third person
unless 'with the consent of one 'of the
parties.
Agnes was astonished and confounded
by the words of the other, and easily
became convinced that the fortune-teller
was endowed with a power~ supernatural.
She did not for a moment suspect that
the woman might be an accomplice of
her betrayer, and by him furnished
with the information that enabled her to
make the revelations which filled, her
with such feelings of wonder and aston-
ishment. She thought only of her plans
of vengeance-and, being blind to every.
thing else, it is not to be surprised at,
that she should fall easily into the snare
laid by the' other.

This appeal was made by a~ f~tlom,
ragged creature, who encountered a young
man near the crossing of. Fourth and
Sycamore, on the evening subsequent to
the events we have just'~e1ated.
The one addressed paused, and' aftei
gazing at the. applicants moment, replied,
as h~ ~jected a quantity Qf tobacco juice
at the nearest lamp-post~
"So yer want more moneyAo get 'tight'
on, do yer? I should calculate you had
more licker in yer. spirit-room r~ow than
you could navigate with comfortably."
"No-no - I must have something
to steady my nerves, ors I shall perish,"
answered the other in a husky, tone of
voice.
"Poor feller 1" said the. young man
compassionately, "you do seem to be in
a bad fix. But don't you Think;that a
cup~of hot'coffee and.a wiWm~ beefsteak
wonid do you more good'? I'll treat y~r
to that, for I don't like~to~see~e~ poor fel-

"Anything: I care net ~what it is, so
that it will quench this burning thirst,"
and he pressed his hand upon his bosom.
"Well, then, come 'long'with me~o~ver
to:the 'Boston,' for they do things up in
the right kind of style there, I tell you.
I always eats at the 'Boston,' 'cause
Fales is a gentleman, and no mistake."
Nothing further was said 'by either,
and they soon entered the testaursnt
spoken of, and took a seat at olie of 4he
tables. Then for the first time each, had
a fair look at the other's features. The
next moment the beggar exclaimed with
startling emphasis,

The one spoke to started as the. tones
of the others' voice fell upon his ear, and
bending over the table, he gazed for a few

The plot of this work hinges upon the division of an estate which, In the course of twenty years, swells
from two millions to one hundred millions of dollars, In this work the author has endeavored to picture,

It has been the object of the author to picture New York suit is, by picturing not only its present, but its
floating population-grouping together characters froik theilld World, and from all parts of the Union. How
well he has succeeded in his work, the public best can.judge.

some have deemed objectionable. Mr. Lippard's style always was, and ever will be, original, and for that
reason (if for nothing else) we are always bound to admire it.
"Take It all in all, it is a book we would like everybody to read. It Is the work ofgenlus, and the emana-
