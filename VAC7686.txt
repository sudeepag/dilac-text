This change, so new to them, and so i ~ortant in its bearings
their 5l~arest interests, was regarded by t ~ olA inhabitants with
~ to be placed, for the first time, under the 'iEeguard of a trial by
solicitude.                  ''
Mr. Jefferson, anxious to re~ider the newly est~b1ished tribunals ac~
ceptable to the people, appointed to the office of J~u4~e of that District, a
man whom, of all others capable of performing i~ duties, he deemed
m9st calculated to gain their confidence, and to rer4~Ive their prejudices
against the new administration of justice. Judge Li~as ~vas a native of
France, and though true to his adopted country, whic1~ he had ably reps
resented in Congress, still, in heart and soul he was a Frenchman,
spoke their native language, attd felt, in common wlth a very large
proportion of thti~ people of the territory, the strongest of all bonds of
union-a similar nationcd origin.
The second WEonday of May, 1805, now near at hand, was the day
appointed for ~o~1ing the first session of this newly appointed court.-
The Sheriff, Clerk, and other officers were appointed, a jury had been
sun~mone4,"and the Judge hix~aself Id arrived in the vill~e. One of
the l&amp;~st"~nd most c6niiii~dl6~s houses in' the town had ~,een rented
and fitted tt~, and e~ei~y ~hThg wa~ in readiness for opening t~te court on
th~ morrow4.'
Aside from the new mode of administering justice which was about
to be commenced, there was another consideration that instead the

parents, was to 'he~tied for her life. She, Was 'charged with the ~ppaTh

arts to gain the favorable 'opinion of Claudine, but her pure mind shrunk~
intuitively, from all conversation with him that she could well airoid,
and it was not without an effort that she constrained her feelings
sufficiently to treat him with. the attention whirh the forms of soci-
ety required.         /
The evident aversion of Claudine was well calculated to excite the
malice of such a man as Robertson, and he secretly resolved that he
would not hesitate at the commission of any crime, to humble the
haughty 'girl, and bring her to his feet. From that moment he redoub-
led his attentions to Pierre, who in a few weeks was persuaded, in op-
position to the 'advice of his uncle, and the entreaties of his sister, to
accompany Robertson on a trading expedition among the Indians,
and from thence to New Orleans.
On their return, after an absence of nearly a year, the air and man-
ner of these two associates toward each other, had undergone a decided
change. Hitherto, and down to the time of their departure from St.
Charles on that excursion, the bearing of Robertson toward Pierre, had
been extremely respectful; in fact, he had uniformly paid. him the most
flattering attentions. Now, Claudine saw with pain that her brother al-
most trembled in his presence, while Robertson played the part of a
man who can trample upon another with impunity, and glories in mak-
ing that power manifest to others. She was not slow' iii discovering
what Robertson evidently intended she should learn-th~aV1~liere was a
secret between him and he;r brother, that placed the ~ complete-
ly at his mercy. Nor was it long before she became aware of the
purpose which the unprincipled villain intended to effect by means of
the fatal ascendancy he had acquired over Pierre.
Robertson one day, had the audacity to pay his "addresses" to Clau-
dine, believing that the deep anxiety which she evidently felt for Pierre
would influence her mind~ Her repulse was firm and decided, but re-
spectful. But when at length his, proposal was renewed, and in a man-
ner not to be misunderstood, she repelled him with all the indignant
scorn, and the deep loathing which she' had so long restrained. Irri-
tated almost to frenzy by the scornful rejection of a girl over whom he
had supposed his power, through fears for her brother, was decided,~
he threw off the mask of pretended affection for her, and boasted that
by a few words he could bring Pierre to the gallows, and declared
that the only means by which his silence could be secured, was to unite
all their interests together.
Claudine heard this dastardly threat, ~vith far deeper anguish than


CT4AUDLN1~ IAAYAtLE, OR

she chose to betray, yet' calmly, firmly replied, that if Robertson actu-
ally possessed the power over her brother that he boasted, neither du-
ty to her brother, nor to herself, required her to sacrifice more than life
itself to shield him from justice-that it would be far better for him, to
betray his friend and associate to an ignominious death, thamn for her
ever to marry an unprincipled villain, knowing him to be such-a fate
ten-fold worse than death itself.
The villain departed, abandoning all present hopes of success,
though not relinquishing his purpose. Pierre now led a miserable life~
Robertson kept him in constant fear of exposure and punishment. One
day, he asked his sister to take a walk with him, to a favorite grove
beyond the village, where all the rural festivals of the youth were cele-
brated-the favorite resort of the young in their evening promenades.-
For some time past, a coolness had existi~d on the part of Claudine toward
her brother, caused by his continued intimacy with Robertson, and their
accustomed walks had ceased.' Claudine declined accompanying him,
but when he assured her that he' wished to acquaint her' with an im-
portant secret, in which his fate was involved, she consented.
With the fond hope that a sister's devoted ~love might, extricate him
from the toils of his unprincipled associate, she, took his arm. As they
approached the well known grove of walnut trees, her heart beat vi-
olently. Sh4~lreaded, yet earnestly desired, to hear the revelation of
her unfortunate' brother, which she greatly feared would disclose some
dark crime, of which he had been guilty. They entered the grove, and
Claudine looking anxiously around, to see that no one was near who
could listen to their conversation, took a seat upon the mossy trunk of
a fallen tree, and with a livid paleness of countenance and quivering
lips, requested Pierre to make the disclosure he had proposed. Instead
of complying with the request, he utter'cd a shrill whistle. Inst~tntly
a rustling was heard in the bushes, and in a moment more, Robertson
stood before them. Claudine was surprised, and highly indignant, but
not alarmed. She felt that under the protection of a brother, unworthy
as he was, she had nothing to fear.
Robertson assumed an air of humble, respectful deference, and en-
treated her pardon for having thus undesignedly intruded himself upor
her and her brother. His professions of love, and his solicitation, of her
hand in marriage were earnestly renewed. Pierre joined his entire~
ties to those of Robertson. Influenced by the previous threats of his
associate, to expose him to public execration ~ud the gallows, 'Pierreim.
plored her, with all the eloquencee which his abject, cowardly rears in~

TIlE li'IHST CONVICT.                            7'

spired, to yield her consent. Claudine made no reply to these entrea,-
ties but a look of withering 'scorn, and by tui~ning her back upon them,
to return to the village. Robertson, .seeing her about to escape, sprang
forward, and before she was aware of his intentions, seizing her rude..
ly by the arm, sought to detain her. "Now, my scornful beauty," ex-
claimed the ruffian, with a fearful oath, "now, my scornful beauty, you
shall not escape me. If you do notvalue your brother's life, I will try
other means that will make you even more willing to consent to a union
with me, than I am myself. Swear that you will marry me, or by hea-
vens you shall not leave thu place till-" The ,rest of the ruffian's
threat expired upon his lips, unuttered, for a loud, crashing noise, in
the bushes near at hand, startled him, and in his alarm at what he sup..
posed, for a moment, was some one rushing to her assistance, he released
her. The noise was occasioned by the hasty retreat of Pierre, whose
fear of Robertson was so great that 'he cowardly abandoned her to her
fate.
When Claudine saw that her brother had basely fled and left her
in the power of a villain, the imminence of her peril, instead of paraly-
zing all her faculties, inspired her with almost superhuman energy and
presence of mind. Recollecting that, by chance, she had about her a
pair of sharp pointed scissors, which she had been using just before she
and her brother set out upon their walk, she coolly, and with a firm hand,
brandished them as a weapon of self-defense. Robertson was con-
scious that he had proceeded too far to retreat with safety. His hand
had'already grasped a pistol, resolved to secure his own safety, but in
what manner is left only to conjecture, for at that moment of fearful
peril to the unprotected girl, an Indian hunter who chanced to be sear'ch-
ing for game in that vicinity, heard the wild screams of Claudino for
help, bounded with the swiftness of a deer in the, direction of the sound?
and arrived at that crisis of deadlyy peril to' Claudine.
Robertson, muttering a fierce threat against her brother, if she disclo-
sed his villainy, fled. Claudine, having seen the Indian at her uncle's,
obtained his protection till she reached the village. Hardly had she
seated herself in her own room, exhausted by the excising scenes through
which she had passed, when Pierre entered, and, in the most moving
terms, entreated her not to expose Robertson. His own life, he said, de-
pended upon her silence. Robertson had sworn that he should die on

never again to return to St. Charles, and trusting that ~'ierre would
reform when separated from his~unprincipled associate, she gave the
pledge ol~ silerice that he requested. She hesitated less in giving this
promise not to expose Robertson, because his departure would relieve
her from all danger from that source, and besides, she reflected that she
could not relate the scene in the grove, without consi~mng her own bro-
ther to infamy, expeUing him from all reputableso~ty, and perhaps of
driving him, headlong, into a career oi~ cringe. Ev~!n should Robertson
return to the village, it would be easy for her t~o avoid him.
CHAPTER II.
"What am I now? How ends my day of life?  ~
For end it must; and terrible this gloom,
This qtorm of horrors, that surrounds its close."-{Miee Bailile.
For several wee)~s, Miss Lavulle neither saw nor heard of her per-
secutor. He had left the village. Pierre, no longer under his influence,
became regular inliishabits. The, hopes of his sister rose high, for what
will riot a fon&amp; sister hope fora brother~ 11e boarded at the house of
her uncle, ate at the same table with her, and the rest of the family,
but lodged in a small tenement, or out-house, a short distance from the
house in which the family resided, but enclosed in the same yard.
The dwelling house of Mr. Duclore, was one of those low, but
commodious buildings, so common among the French of Lower Cana-
da~ It stood some few feet from the ground, was of ~eat length, and
divided in the center by a wide passage that separated one half of the
house from the other. The room occupied by Claudinewas at one end
of this long pile, remote from the sleeping room of her uncle and aunt.
This, however, formed no objectioki, ~or the town was so quiet th~it few
doors could boast either of a locir, oi~ bolt. To Claudine's door, botl&amp;
bad beeh affixed, at her request, since her interview with Robertson.
About six weeks after ~he memorable scene in the grove, which we
*       have just related, Claudine, who had passed the day in company with
her aunt, at the house of a sick neighbor, returned home just at dark.
It was a part of her daily duties to take care of her brother's room. She
now recollected that she had fail~cI to make his bed. It was not yet dark,
and she hastened to repair het neglect, before supper, which would
*       soon beuponthe tabLe. Her uncle and brother had also been abserit dii-
ring the day, and dined abroad, but both had now returned.
In the direction in which Claudine approached the out-house in which

THE P~EBT eo~vior.~
her brother slept, no one could be seen from the in~side. When she
r4ched' the corner of the building, her footsteps were sudde~rly arrest-
ed, by0the sound of voices from within. She paused, and bent her ear
to a crevice in the wall. To her utter astonishment, she heard the
voice of Robertson. He was in earnest conversation with her brother~
They spoke in a low, suppressed tone, b~it with all her faculties power-
fully excited, every word, every syllable they uttered was distinctly heard,
and fefl upon her heart like molten lead. She heard them concert a.
plot, of which ske was the intended victim. At the dead hour of mid'~
night, when all the family were buried in profound sleep, Robertson was
to enter her apartment. If he failed of gaining an entranceby the means
they had devised, Pierre was to knock at her door) call to her, gently,
and under pretence of being seized with sudden illness, for which he
wanted her aid, quietly introduce Robertson. Should any possible mis'
chance defeat their plans, and Claudine succeed in alarming the fami'
ly, Robertson was to flee instantly for Prairie Des Sioux, while Pierre
remained at the door of his sister's apartment, ready to swear that no
one but himself hadapproached. Thus, in any event, all suspicion of
evil intentions, would be effectually prevented.
Claudine waited to hear no more, but glided back, cautiously, and
unperceived, to the house. Pale and agitated, she entered the apart..
ment occupied by the family, threw herself into a chair, to collect her
thoughts, and reflect, coolly, upon the course most advisable for her to
pursue.
Had she followed her first intention, the dictate of the moment, she
uld have gone instatitly tQ her uncle, di~cIosed the plot against her,
and demanded his protection. But a few minutes of cool considerationi,
induced her to abandon this course, for it would be fatal to the reputa-
tion of her brother, and deeply as Pierre had wrOnged her, she hadnot
forgottenthat he was her brother. Guilty as he was, she tru~ted he
would yet reform if he could be severed from all connection with
Robertson.
After long meditation, C~audi~e resolved not to disclose the dark plot,
but adopt such measures as would efrectually defeat it. She ihou~ht olE
asking permission to sleep that night in the apartment of hex~ a~4t~t,
and on the morrow, obtain permission to occupy, thereafter, *i
nearer .to her's. Hut, recollecting that there was but one b~4 iii her
aunt's sleeping apartment, she abandoned that idea. Oii~ ~efI~ctioi~,
atreal cause of fear was there, after all, to aeter her from remaining
iii her own room? There was both a lock and a bolt to her door, either

ing entrance to her room, and this, too,' was secure against the possit ility
of entrance from the outside. These reflections dispelled her~fears,
and calmed the agitation of her mind.
Supper was announced, and at that moment Pierre entered and took
his seat at the table, with the rest of the family.' Instead of being op-.
pressed with the consciousness of the crime he meditated, lhe appeared
unusually light-.hearted, talked much, and in a tone of gaiety.
Claudine dared not turn her eyes in the direction of her brother, lest
her countenance should betray a knowledge of their dark designs. It
was even with extreme difficulty that she could shallow a sufficiency of
food to escape observation anpl remark, whic17 she was so anxious to
avoid. She drank a cup of coffee, and by great exertion and presence
of mind, appeared so much at ease that her extreme paleness, and want
of appetite, escaped observation.
Her uncle casually inquired of Pierre, when he had last seen Robert-
son. ' Caudine felt her countenance become still paler,,as she listened,

r'assment, that he had not seen Rotertson since his departure for Prairie
Des Sioux, six weeks ago. "He knew not," he said, "whether he still
resided at that place, but believed that he had left the country altogethei-,
and gone to reside in New-Orleans."
Claudine could hardly repress the feeling of utter loathing which this
new proof of, Pierre's villany and hypocrisy excited. It, required all the
tenderness of a sister for an only brother, to restrain her fromt adopting
means of 'protecting herself from their deep-laid schemes of villany, less
forbearing toward that brother, than she had designed.
Supper ended, and the famiilj withdrawn, from the talle, Pierre still
detained his seat, all the time talking in a light and airy style of trifling,
and busied himself in a tempting to balance his tea-spoon up on the edge
of his cup. -At length, he rose sueldeniy, and under pretence of having
just 'ecollected the subject, remarked with a careless air, that he. would
take some of the fragments of 'the supper to feed his .dog, gathered, upon
a plate, several articles of food, and departed..
Claudine had no difficulty in understanding, by this artful manonuvre,
that Robertson was still in the, apartment of her brother, and intended.'
that no one in St. Charles' should know that .he was- in the village, or,
have any reason to suspect that he had left Prairie Des Sioux.-

' The hour when the family usually -retired to their beds,; ari'ived.-
. Claudine, in conformity with the uniform practice of' French families,
bade her aunt "Good Night," with an affectionate kiss, which was return-
ed in 'the same k nd manner. Whern she bestowed upon her uncle,
the same parting salutation, she whispered a few words in his ear that
made him start back with astonishment, rnd exclaim, '9fonwDidufa/.'gt~z
can the child want with an axe, at this time of night ?" 'Her aunt sawr
by. the pale and agitated countenance of her'diece, that ishes.hadi~rmade
the request for some purpose which she did not wish, .just at that rhe-
nment, to disclose, and with the tact of a woman, camre 'instantly to her
relief. Giving her husband no opportunity to distress the 'girV with
further inquiries, she busied herself in procuring the article required,
chattering all .the while with the volut ility of a sprightlyr French 'A oman,
upon other and indifferent topics; Fortunately, the axe happened to be
in the house. It -had been sent that day to a shop, to be ground, and the
lad who brought it -home, in the absence of the family, left it irn the
house.
Claudine received the axe from the hands of her aunt, and without
uttering a word, retired, taking it with her, into her own room. Then,
first examining every corner of her apartment, and looking carefully
under her bed, to see that no one lurked beneath it, she locked, and
booked her door. After these precautions, as if to make assurance doubly
sure, she drew her bureau against the door, and placed behind the tearit,
every remaining article of furniture that she had in the room; The
window, also, was carefully secured. She then paused, and surveyed
her fortifications with a smile of triumph, perfectly satisfied that no one
could senter the room, without using violent means that would alarm the
whole neighborhood.
Placing the axe, that deadly weapon of self-defense, near the head of
her bed, without the slightest expectation that any serious tuipt to
-enter the room would be made, and commending hiemseleirdntlyto
the guardian care of, the "Virgin Mother of God," she reited toebt,
with a feeling of perfect security. Fatigue~d by the labors of e'd#y,
and, exhausted by the exciting emotions that she had endured, Cadtdine
sunk at once, into a calm, and profound sleep.
A noise of' an unusual' kind awoke her. The sun bad already risen.
Springing from her bed, and peeping between the folds of her winddcr
curtains, she saw,-with astonishment, several of the inhabitantf fthe
village: hurrying- rapidly across the yard. The' view ifrom the witidow
~was toordimited to pertnit her to discover where they were going. M'ith

haMe she proceeded ~to pdt on her dress, but had not yet completed her
toilet, when a load' noise was heard at her door, and severM v6icea at
cuse, called her by name, and demanded admittaiTice. Before she had
time to remove all the articles that blockaded the entrance of her zpart-
merit, the door was unceremoniously opened, and several men, acoor4~
paui~d by her unele, and a magistrate, entered. A crowd followed, and
hung round the door, with openmouthed wonder and curiosity. Miss
LavaUe~ ~a~ed with speechless astonishment upon this unexpected throng
vf itiorflin~ visitors. Not so the magistrate, wlfb gave orders to his
attendants t~ permit no one to enter the room, or leave it, till he had
a legal examination of the premises.
Looking around the room, with a searching eye, the handle of the axe,
under the bed, caught his view. He drew it forth. Great God! what
'ci sight! It was the very same axe that the girl had placed at her
bed-side, 6n retiring to sleep, but the handle of it, 'from one end to the
dtlier, was clotted thickly with blood. Upon the blade was distinctly
seen a t ut~t of human hair, of a dark auburn color. The gore, in con
gealing, had caused it to adhere to the' smooth steel.
The magistrate asked the stupefied girl, "how that 'instrument came
there, and in that condition?" Before she had time to utter a word in
reply, the voice of Mr. Mordaunt, a talented young lawyer, wJ~o had
receht'ly settled i~ St. Charles, rose loud and' clear above the tumult,
Commanding her, on the peril of her life, to answer no questions, and
iitt~r not a word, till he should have an 'opportunity ol conv~r~ing with her,
a moment, in private. Then, turning to the magistrate, he added, "I
constitutO myself the counsel of that young lady, till 'she 'has time to clroo$e
One, to protect her rights; and I will take the liberty of inforrnin~ you1~
worship, most respectfully, that neither law, nor yet justice, gives you the
4ght to ask her a single question, the an~Wer of which might cnirninate
herself." *Th~mt officer replied that he had no such intenti~h, but, ~mi~che
contrary, made ~he inquiry about the axe, under a full impression that she
might explain, in a satisfactory manner, every citcumstance that appa.
rently seemed to militate against hers
All this while Mis's Lavalle stood motionless, silent, rind hor~sttuck,
anxious to gain a clue to this mysterious affair, yet unable to utter u 'word

affectionately, informed the trembling girl that Pierre' had 13e&amp;n fomXrxd

sides m~umerous wounds with which the body was gashed, the 'head was
completely severed from the trunk. Th~re was another circumstance
which, after som'e hesitation, he related to his njeec. Near Pierre's
bed was found a shoe, a~d a 'shawl, both of which the uncle and aunt
had inadvertently admitted that Claudine Wore, when she retired to her
'apartment, on the night previous.
It is needless to give; in detail, an account of her examination 'before
the magistrate. That officer 'deemed it Iris duty to commit her for trial,
'at the approaching session 'of the U. S. District Court. it was hardly
possible that his decision could, in justice, have been otherwise, for the
'bloody axe, found in her aparunent, and many other circumstances,
'seOmed ta~furnish pooltive proof c~i bet &amp;uilm. The appearance of her
room, too, iadieated, beyond the possibility of a doubt~ that ho ohe had
entered it. ~rid tjiat entrance Was 1nmp~ssible without using violence,
which Evidently had, not been employed. Such was the belief of the
niagistrate~ 'after a thorough examination of the premises, and such,%o,
w~s'the 'opinion of all' who looked around the apartment.
Cla'udine made no disclosure of the plot that induced her to barricade
her door 'and arm herselff with the fatal axe Would it be bhliev'sd, she
asked herself, that Robertson had made the base attempt that he did in
'the grove, and yet she say not a 'wordjo all this, even to her runt ?.-.-.
'Ignnraxit'of law, she knew not but such a confession, at that late hour,
.might not ~be made to bear heavily against her. But there ~x*s still
an~iher~mnotjve for silence, that weighed far more' with her than any con~

priest had prolonged his accustomed visit to the prisoner, far beyond the
period usually assigned to his visits.. Thethfrd hour after midnight, when
the first scene of the story opens, Lound him yet in her dungeon. Under
the seal o~ the sacrament of confession, she had related' to him again, cir-
cuznstantial4, her first interview with Robertson, his subsequent course,
his influence over Pierre, and the plot sha had overheard at the out-house
occupied by her brother.
N otwithstanding the impossibility of accounting for many ~ircuin5tanCe8
that bore with crushing weight against her, Father L~roche had not the
remotest doubt of her entire innocence. His suspicions rested strongly
against Robertson, but ai ter the ifiost diligent, searching inquiry, nothing
had been elicited to connect him with that tragedy. On the morning of
the murder he ~vas seen at Prairie Des Sioux, and no proof existed that
he h~d left that place.
The venerable priest did not conceal from his ward, that her conviction
at the apprdaching trial, was nearly certain. No judge or jury. he assur.
edl~er, would resist the strong array of circumstantial evidence of her guilt,
especially when her acquittal would inevitably bring !own upon their own
heads, a stprm of popular indignation He gave her, in detail, such in.
formation ~nd advice as he thought would be useful to her, on her trial
upon the morrow.
It vA east midnight, when all that related to her defense,~and to her
other temporal concerns, had been hilly discussed. Nothing now re-
inain~ ~or him to do, at this last solemn interview with the prisoner
~eceding~er trial, but to fortify her mind to bear with calm r~ignation
*the doom that might await. Deeply did he feel the peril of the afflicted
girl. He had known her from the earliest days of her infadcy and
since the death of her parents, had been, her guardiar~, 'and felt for her
the affection of a father. He now administered to her 'the conse~t~ted
wafer, and prayed, most fervently prayed for her, the lonely captive.
It is 4oply when affliction s press heavily upon us, and every hope of
humar~ aid is torn from the bruised heart, that we invoke tjie aid of
Heaven with all the deep fervor~f~ q~r souls. The prices felt that no
arm could shield the unhappy girl, but that of Omnipotence, and he
poured ~forth his supplications with an earnestness that shook his whole
'frama, In the deep fervor of )iis prayer, thi venerable old man bowed
his head till his white locks touched the cold stone floor. As if conscious
'that the intercession of the saints~ or even of the Blessed Virgin herself,
could avail not in that dark and fearful hour, he addressed no prayer, no
supplication to them, but appealed directl!J to Him who was ~rucifled.'-.

venerable priest implored Hint, by the memory of his own arraignnwnt
at the bar of Pontius Pilate by his own condemninion and death up~n

The scene was one of deep and stAemn interest. There sa~t the youth.
ThI prisoner, upon a, bundle of straw, pn~the stone floor, in the~n~dle of
the prison. The feeble light of the ~xpii~ii~' la~mp4one dlm4d fit-
fully, in the damp, unwholesome air of the~dungeon~~ Th~e ;she sat
her manacled hands 'clasped ,in prayer, her head Len~ reyerei~tly toward
th~ earth. As she moved, slightly, the clanking of her Qhainb sent forth
a lo~v sound that vibrated upon the heart o~ the old priest. Mis whole
soul was pc~ured out in that prayer.
His supplications fail~ of in~piring either himself or his ward, with
even a shadow of hope of her acquittal, yet in its stead, a calm a~nd Loly
resignation, like a healing 'balm, diffused itself through her soul. She
felt a cllild4ike confidence' in the wis&amp;om and goodness of her Heav~tnly
father, and whether life or death might be her doom, she doubted not
that it would be meted out to her in love.
The priest rose from his knees, and recommending Claudine to snatch
a few hours of sleep, bade her a most bender adieu, and departed~ to~ee~k
for himself a brief repose, before the labors of the eventful day should
commence, which would require all his energies. ,
Claudine sat, for many minutes after his departure, buried in deep and
painful thoughts. Just as she, was preparing to lie down to sleep, upon
her bed of straw, her attention was aroused by a faint sou9d in a distant
part of her dungeon.. To her' astonishment, a narrow 4oor, which she'
had never before noticed, slo*ly'an,4,cauriously opened. A human figure,
the outline alone of'.ivhich was vi~i~ie, in tjbe dim ol~scurity, entered, and
by signs, earnestly entreated silence. , T~iis ur~expected apparition ap-
proached the spot where she still sat, and stood, directly ,~eLore her. It.
was Robertson.
"You have nothing to fear," said he, "if' you are silent., I have come'
to sai~e, not to injure. But you must, Oot imagine . that I will permit you
to endanger my own safety, with im~~iity. Utter but one single cry, to
alarm the jailor, and I send a bullet through .ypur1heart1, an(l then'escape
by the way that I etitered, without affording q;~rly4zw, the least clue
to my detection." As he uttered, this threat, he rais~1 his ann4 and the'
light of the la~rip gleamed on the br~gLt carrel of api~to1.
Fear and astonishn~ent, not unmingled with curiosity, kept her. silent..

which was probably unknown to tb!~ %*e*~rit jaior, He had e~itered-by
means of -a false key, which he had-~hh~xaelf -manufactured for that ~pur-
pose.
Robertson proceeded to address4he young prisoner in-the -most -gentle
and -s~cthi~g tones of compasal'on. He expressed- the -utmost-regret for
her ~ ~or/ditica~ 'H~ had conversed with many gentlemen of
infiueiiee nad in~elligence,-ull of -whonr were~ confident that she would
be condemned. He had a horse ready for her to mount, -a- few r-od!s
from the pi'ison~ He wouki conduct her to his residence in Prairie Des
Sioux, Where she could rei~iain concealed, till the next night, -when-he
would embark with her in a skiff which he had already -provided, and
descend the Mississippi to New Orleans, or to some other place, where,
under an -assumed name, they could reside in safety. The moment it
could -be done without danger of detection, hewo~ld. marry her, lawfully.
2~ow was her only chance of escape, he said. After her trial and con~
demnation, and -eortdemned ~she most assuredly would -be, the -prison
would be too carefully guard~d-to afford him another opportunity of -en-
tering it, without detection.
Encouraged by her silence ~f believe that she assented to all he had
uttered, he proceeded. No effort of - which he was capable should be
spared to render her life happy. He professed unbounded-affection,
and deeply ~depIbred his base conduct in the grove. Despair of -obtain-
ing her hand in marriage, he said, had driven -him into a momentary
frenzy, for which he humbly besought her pardon. "Come," said he,
"we have not a moment to lose in making our escape. -it will -be Che
work of but a few minutes for me t~ ~reliev~ you of your chains, and con-
duct you outside of the prison. Oi ~mounted behinTd me upon -the iiorse

the manner -of- your escape, and - no plsrsuit- will be made."
Saying this. he advanced, and bending down to where-she-sat-on -the
floor, took hold of her arm-to raise her to her feet. His touch pro-
duced- the effect of an electric shock, and she recoiled as -if a serpent
had sung her.
"Begone!" skid she, in a tone that -expressed all - the deep -loathing
of her-soul -for -his dark treachery and -villany, "Begone! - and leave -~e
- to my fate! No doom that may await me, can -be so revolting -to ~e, as

w ~oie fra~c, an~ she involuntarily paused. Quickly recovering from
the emotions which that horrible image had excited, she continued:
"Death, under aii.y form, is far preferable to a union with you, even
could that union be sanctioned by the holy rites of the church. - You
have inflicted upon me the grosse~ injustice, and attempted to commit
a Wrong which no ti~ue woman can forgive, even on her death bed.-
Ilut even this is not-all. I charge you, James Robertson, with the mur--
der of my brother.-~-in the presence of God, the searcher of all hearts, -
I charge you with that murder for which I am c~omed to die!"
In uttering these words, Claudine rose to her feet, and stood erect,
before him. Her eye flashed, and her look -was one of stern defiance,
and firm resolve. Robertson turned pale. With all his boldness of vil-
lany, he quailed at the- unexpected charge of murder, a~d the fearless
manner in which it was made, by a timid girl who, he had not doubted,
would eagerly seize upon any chance, to escape from prison. But
(1UiCkJy recovering his natural audacity, he replied: "You chai'ge me
with a crime of which I am incapable. - Your brother was my dearest
friend, and I can easily prove that on the night of the murder, I was at
Prairie Des Sioux, and that for more than a month previous t~ that
melancholy event, I had not once le~ft that place~"
Claudine made no other reply to this, but a brief relation, in a few
expressive words, of the plot she had overheard between him and her
brother, on the night of the murder.
At this disclosure the countenance of Robertson became livid. -~ ~Not
daring to remain longer iii the pi~ison, he made a last effort io operate
upon her fears, and induce her to accompany him. Finding all his
arguments and entreaties hopeless, -he left the prison, his heart torn '~'ith
the fierce passions of rage, disapp&amp;iiited hopes, malice and revenge.
Claudino made no attempt to rd~m the jailor, or prevent his escape,
for she knew that the first cry sheuttered would be followed by instan-~
taneoi~s death to herself, without proving the means of his detection.
lie had the power in his hands of gaining the outside of the prison,
and of subsequent escape, an(l yet leave behind him not a single en-
dence that he had entered.

of unnumbered wild lowerss, known onl'y to those iS~irnense plains o4
the West.
From the earliest .hours~ of the morning,, people could be seen at a.
great distance, some on foot, some on 'horse-back, and others in-wagons,
all wending their. way to the village: Far as the eye coitid extend its.
vision,~ tl~e broad prairie that sweeps off frotm. the village till it meets the
horizon, was; here and. there dotted with moving points. Now it was
a horseman,, there a pedestrian, a wagon,~ca.rt, or some other kjnd o$ ye-
hide employed on the- frontier~. The land-mark by which they direc-
ted their course over this "sea of verdure," was-ar tall, mound that stood
alone in this ~ilent 'waste The storms of ages had worn and. rounded
us summit into two graceful cones~ to whiclv the early French settler~
gave the appropriate name 'of "Les .4farnel1es.~' Entire families, from
the aged grandsire down to the infant upon its mother's bosom, had ar-
rived.from.~a distance of several days' journey. Great numbers had en-
camped in' the neighborhood of. the village, and the smoke of camp-
fires rose from alL the surrounding. gxoves..
It was not alone., the interest these crowds. felt in hearing the trial
of Claudine that4~ad drawathem hither. Under the Spanish govern-
inei~ they had been accustomed to' see the convict brought~ forth for pun--
ishul nt before the last. et~ho of his sentence had expired. They were'
not aware that i~nder~ the humane laws of the Upited States an interval.
of several weeks intervenes between the sentence of. death and its ex-
ecution, and hence it was that not a small part of this immense
throng of human beings came therewith the expectation-of seeing C1au-
dine Lavalle executed.
The hour of ten~ o'clock in the morning; arrived and' the d~rs o~ the
building appropriated on this occa~j~4~to' the use of the court, were
thro~vn open. Judge Lucas took hi~seat, and aie Shcriff, by his order,.
declared in due form that' the court '~vas now open for the transaction ci:
business.. The jury ~was called and sworn in, when the judge delivered
to theni- an impressive charge both in French and in English.. The
U. S. Attorney for the Thstrict then moved that the court do now pro-
ceed with the trial of the flr~t case on the d6cket, that of Claudine La..
valle,~charged with the crime of murder. This motion was granted, and
the sheriff ordered to-bri~ng forth the pi'isoner.
In a moment every- spectator hurried £ron~ the court, ~nxiou~ to-catch-
~ g~im~ipse of the fiend in human shape who had murdered' her own ai~d1
only brother. The intelligence that she was about to be conducted int~o'
court, spread like wild-fire among the engur. throngs that crowded' the

I

-streets of the ~iillage. The sheriff had taken the precaution of stim-
moning to his aid a band .ef militia armed with muskets, and fixed bay..
'onets, to keep off ~the crowd. It was not without -difficulty that even
these, .arme'das they were, could induce the..eagerm~ilt.itude to lee.ve an
open space for the ~ssage of the sheriff and .his prisoner.
At length the massive key was heard turning the hoIt~ of the lock, anti
ithe iron~barred door slowly swung open. -Claudine Lavalle -came forth,
walking between the priest and the sheriW ,holding an. arm of each.
'She was dressed in deep mourning. On that day she. had 'paid more
than? ususi attention to her toilet. Her attire was plain., but neat and
highly appropriate. Its extreme-simplicity gave, it a gr~ce which no or-
-nament eould have afforded.
Months had gone 'by since 'the fatal day 'en which she was committed
to prison, and it was now, for the, first time d~iring that long period,, that
~she was permitted to breathe 'the pure air, and gaze upon the face-of
'the heavens. To leave once more the gloomy. vault of her;dungeou,'and
look abroad, even fona short space of time, up ontthe happy living world,
and gaze upon the bright landscape with.which her eye had been Lamib
iiar from infancy-this was enjoyment, exquisite though rnelanchply..
For a time, Iher thoughts seemed wholly occupied~in the contemplation
'of the scenery around her, .and her heart appe~mred.alive. 'only to the
-emotions which that view excite&amp;. Gratitude to that .Almighty Pew~r
who had permitted her to go forth once rno~e, from her living~tomb into
the free and happy world, glowed .i~n ~every feature of. her~ expressive
countenance, 'and a tear tr-embledupan her long and droopfrt~ eyelashes.
The crowds .of spectatorss gazed uponher in silence, and involmunarily
opened an avenue for .her to pass through~ When they beheld the youth-
Liii prisoner, pale from long'i~ep&amp;Iemeirt, her modest, guileless air, the

modest and self-possessed. Father Laroche, whose devoted att~ention
to his ward no unpopularity and no reproach could move, was per-
mitted to sit by her side.
The bill of indictment was read, and the case opened by the pros-
ecuting attorr&amp;ey who remarked that duty compelled hint to lay the guilt
of the prisoner fully before the jury, yet in the management of the
case he should take no undue means to procure her conviction. His
aim, he said, was justice, and to no' one would proof of the inno-
cence of the accused afford more g~atiflcation than to himself.
The witnesses for the prosecution were sworn and examined. It
was proved that Miss Lavalle, about six weeks before her brother's
death, was seen to take a walk with the deceased to the walnut grove
beyon&amp; the village, from which she shortly after returned alone, and
evidently much excited. Her aunt remarking this, inquired of Clau-
dine if she and her brother had quarreled; to which Claudine made no
reply, except that it was the last time sh~ would walk with him.---
From' that day a coldness on the part of Claudine towards her brother
had been visible, and though the aunt named the subject to her, she
made no reply, and gave no explanation ~f the zause.
it was proved,' likewise, that she had taken into her sleeping apart-
ment,' the very axe that was found there, in the morning, covered with
blood. A surgeon sivore that the wounds of which the deceased had
died, were, beyond a doubt, inflicted with an axe, and that the* tuft of
hair adhering to the blade, exac~iy resembled that of the deceased.
It was likewise proved that Cluudine locked and bolted: her door
that night, and that no one could have gained entrance against her
~vill, without using violence that would have awakened the neighbor-
.hood. zTdtat~no.ne .~but herself had entered, was evident' from the ap-
pearance'o1~i~~efl 'the magistrate knocked there the next
morning ~and~demiti~d~ ce. The shoe and the;shawl found by
the bed-side ~of.th~eeea~ed', were proved to belong to Claudine. Her
aunt testifkd that 'she~wore both when she retired to her sleeping apart-
ment on that~6tabnight. On cross-examination, the' aunt te~tifled that
ted on the evening preceding the murder,
and at supper as deadly ptth~, and appeared to avoid looking at her
brother; white Pierre,' on the contrary, seemed ttnusually light-hearted,
talking and laughing incessantly. She also testified to her extreme agi-
tation when she asked her uncle for the axe, and the aunt acknowledged,
on being questioned, that she knew of. no use that instrument could be
to Claudino, nor had she any idea of the purpose to whioh she intended
to apply it.

The last will and testament of Jacques Francois Lavalle was int~'o.
duced, and, after much argument, permitted~ by the court to be read, to
show, as the prosecuting attorney afledged, the motives which the respond.
dent' had for commitving.the dee4. , That instrument devised, property
to the estimated. amount of. seventeen thousand six htuidi~ed 'and ninety
dollars, besides' a Spanish grant of n large and valuable tract of land,
which last claim was in dispute. This property was to be equally divi-
ded between 'his two children, Pierre and Claudine, when the former ar.'
rived at the age of twenty-one years. In the event of the death of cith-
*er before arriving at lawful age, the sutvivor should inhprjt the 'whole
eState.
On the~ part of the defense, no testimony was sought to be, adduced,
except in relation to the character~ of the accused.
Her uncle testitl&amp; that her conduct. had always been 'kind, amiable
rtnd affectionate-that he could not call to mitrd a single fault she had
*eomn2ittocl, from the days of her childhood to the time of her arrest. She
had been to Pierre a fond, devoted sister, ever ready to sacrifice her
own interest to his. It was about six weeis before the murder that he
observed a change in her conduct toward her brother, a shrinking from
his presence anda manifest desire to avoid him, but this appeared to
have passed away, and her usual affe~tionate attentions were renewed.
Father Ambrose Laroche was now called to the stand. His testimony
in substance was briefly this: I am the parish priest of St4 Charles; have
held that office for the last twenty years; 'had known the prisoner at the
bar from her' birth; was the intimate friend of her parents, and on the
death.bed of her 'father, the latter appointed rue sole guardian ~f This
daughter,' Claudine; then a child hardly three years of age4 'lie had
seen her almost daily ever since, and had been her only 'instructor.......
~41ie had ever manifested for him the tender affection of a daughter. In
all the sorrows and trials of her childhood, she had.nev~er failed of com.
ing to him for consolation and advice, nor had her. conduct in. this re~
~pect changed in later years. As her guardian, her friend, and still
'more as her' copfessor, he said that he kne~v her~ heart, he believed,
as thoroughly as it wa~ possible for ~oeTh.unr~n being to knew 'the
heart' of. .~auether, .xand4eelaixed that he had lever known. any one so
.trl~izunishle as 'she. With'a deep sense of the iresponsibilitythat iest.
ed upon him ~ts a minister' at the altar of God, to divest himse.lf~ ~if all
undue prepossessions in her favor, yet would he declare that. ~uich, was
his 'knowledg~of the sterling forthh ~and truthfulness of ~her ~ha~c
ter, that h~' would believe 'her on her bare 'assertion, in 'e~ositj~ ~,

all the testimony' ~ that could he ~arrayed 'against' her. lie wotild have
said more, but was interrupted by the prosecuting attorney, who pro-
ites~ed against his giving mereopirmion instead of facts.
'~The priest ~at down, resuming his seat by the side 'of, his yoting
ward. Claudine had listened with breathless attention to the testimony
of her guardian.; So' deep was the interest she felt, so eager was she
'to catch every' word the venerable Lather uttered, that she leaned for-
'ward'in her 'seat, .unmindPA of all, else that. was passing around her.
When at length he took his seut by her side, she seized his hand, end,
raising it to her 'lips, kissed it again and again with the fondest affec-
tion. The warm approbation of her character which the venerable mata
had expressed was a sweet drop in the bitter cup which she had nearly
drained.
The testimony on each side was aow closed, and th~ prosecutiiig at-
torney. in the opinion 'of all, had convinced ~he jury ~thgr 'guilt. In
all that' crowded assemblage of human beings, there was n~t one, prob-
ably, except the priest, who believed her itmnocent. Mr. Mordaunt, the
sole counsel of the accused,' arose, under these discouraging circumstan-
ces, tie reply. lie has long since gone down into the grave. He died
'in' the spring time of his life,' before he had yet gathered the laurels
that would hare rendered his fame enduring. There aro yetin Mis-
~ouri here and.there a venerable few yet hingeriog, who listened with
thrilling interest to his masterly defense of Claudine Lavalle. These
venerable patriarchs cannot yet hear that'plea named without betraying
deep emotions. The ,writer 'has before ~him a copy of the ~brief 'notes
taken down from the lips of Mr. Mordaun~ during its delivery,' by a
gentleman longsince deceased.: These notes, though a mere sketch' of
the outlines, afford sufficient proof that his effort on that' oec~asion,
though hopeless one, was indeed masterly. Against the strong array
of evidence in that'case,'success could not have been expected.
He d~velt long upon the deceptive nature of circumstantial evidence,
and contended that no imumber of probabi1iti~,' however numerous~ or
'striking, could make one 'c~rtaint!,., Where the testimony was not po~i-
tive, a:jury could iinot saf4~r say on their qaths that the accused is guilty.

judge asked if they were all agreed, and was answered in the afiirrna-

"GUILTY." Every eye was instantly turned upon the convict, to mark
the' effect of 'that appalling won!. But the certainty of her doom was
far more easily borne than the agony of suspense that preceded it. A
smile of heavenly resignation beamed upon her features as she pressed
the hand of the good old priest silently in hers. The venerable father
uttered no exclamation of grief, and shed no tears. He reverently
bowed his gray head, and in a low but fervent tone breathed the shea

Judge Lucas now put on the black .cap and addressed the prisoner~
"Claudine Lavalle: After a Lair and impartial investigation of the law
and the evidence of your case1 a jury of your country on their oath.
have' declared you guilty of the murder of Pierre Lavalle, your own
brother. It only remains for the court to perform the painful duty of
pronouncing sentence of death upon you. Have you any thing to say
why such sentence should mnot be pronounced?"
Here the judge made a solemn pause to await her answers Clau.~
dine was aware that the inquiry was a mere form, and that no reply of
hers could affect her doom. Yet to her, the answer that she Would give
seemed a relinquishment of her last claim, upon life, a severance of the
only remaining tie that connected her with the living world, and slowly
and deliberately she pronounced the single word "NOTHING:' but in a
tone, an~ ~yith. a look that thrilled to every heart.
The judge proceeded: "It is my order, then. that you be remanded to
the prison from whence you were taken, and there kept in close con-
fin~rnent till the sixteenth day of June next, on which day, between the
hours of one and five o'clock in the afternoon, you be taken thence by
the sheriff to the place of execution, and there hung by the neck till you
be dead; and may God have mercy on your soul."
It was near sunset when Claudine Lavalle, now under sentence o~
death, slowly wended her way back to her still
dungeon,    accompcttfl((
by her faithful gu~rdiau and the' sheriff. Her trial had been brief, fec

Pity for the poor girl took place ~f the fierce, vindictive spirit-ofL re~

been t~'pposed to her conviction.
In this state of public opinion rather Laroche privately repaired to
St. Louis, and called upon Gen. Wilkinson, .the newly-arrived Govern-

Ralinond D'Iberville, a wealthy planter of the Coast. A lady of thirty.
five years~, whose form and features are stiUbeautiful,~ sits alone, reclin-
eng in a pensive attitude upon a rich ottoman. The cpstly furniture and
the elegance of the apartment afford her no pleasure. Her, thoughts
are far away and busied with the, long past. Sadness like a darl~ cloud
steals over her expressive countenance, and grows deeper and deeper as
thought after thought comes thronging onward, and calls up the scenes
of other' times. A gentleman of tall, manly figure, but apparently ten
years older than herself, enters." His presence ha~s not awakened" the
pensive lady from her melancholy reverie. She is unconscious that an
one has entered the room.' The gentleman "'gazes upon 'her mourn~LlI
brow for several minutes, with a look of the fondest affection inin~led
with pity. 'At length he addressed her in French: "Ah! ma chere Ma-

While sa~i this lie had taken a seat upon the ottoman, 'and inge~i~
ously con4ved to place her upon his knee. The lady, awakened' f~om'
her reverie; could not avoid smiling at her husband, and said, "do you
know, Raimond, what' Madam DLlval' said of you the other day? She
said she could not have believed we were married, ~had she xipt actually
seen th~ ceremony 'performed, for you aet, she says, ~ lover to

It need not be told that Madam D'Iberville, the wealthy and polished
lady whose ;society W~s cotirted by the highest ranks in New Orleans,
~vas no other than the Glaudine Lavalle whom we saw twenty years
ago that very day conducted from the court in St. Charles under sen-
tence of death. When the venerable priest had obtained her pardon,
~n. the very x~ight of his return he placed her in the care of a lady who
was ge&amp;ng with her husband to New Orleans. to embark for France.
1-fe consigned his unfortunate ward to the care of his sister in that city,
who was the Superior of the well~known order of nuns, th&amp; Sisters of
Charity. Cl&amp;udin~ was received by the Superior with every mark of
confidence and 1alfection, and immediately became a novice, with tke

~vitiate should have expired. All novices, wh~n they~ er a convent,

Not lone after her admission, Madam D'Iberville, a widd~ of distin-

~arie, 'to reside for .a time in her family, and watch over .her declining
health. The gentle girl ~oen w~n the confidence 'of Madam D'Iber-

for a magistrate to take down my confession. Make haste, for the
sands of my life are fast ebbing away. I am James, Robertson, the
murderer of your brother,, for tvhi~h ctirne you were condemned to die,
and my confession is necessary for your vindication. Be quick, for my
minutes are numbered."
Col. D'Iberville lost no time ~ procuring the attendance 9f a magis.
trate, who took down, in legal form, the dying confession of Robertson.,
The substance of his disclosure, omitting circumstances ,already known
to the render, is the following:
Robertson, burning with malice and~ ~eveng9 at the repulse he had
received from the pure-minded Claudine, resolved to humble the haugh~.-
ty girl over whose heart even his ,wiles had' no influence, and at the risk
~f his own life, bring her to his feet. H~e h~d remarked her devoted
attention to Pierre, and upon that discovery based his plan of operation..
his first measure was to gain such an ascendancy' over Pieue as wculd
render, him submissive to his tvill. With-this object in view, he induced
the young man to accompany him in a trading expedition among the
Indians, and from thence to New Orleans. They left that city in a-
sidff on their return homewards with about.three thousand dollars each,
twquired by their trade and sundry gambling speculations of Robertson..
Near the mouth of the Arkansas a young rnan.who caUed his name
Martin came on board and requested a passage to New Madrid, the
place of his. residence, offering to aid them in rowing. flis request
was granted. On the second day after he came on board, Martin in-
duced Pierre to gamble with him, at first for 'a mere trifle, and, at
length for large stakes. 'The result is already anticipated. Young La-
valle lost every dollar of his money, and~ was left ~ penniless beggar.
The emotions of Pierre were but little ehort of freiizy. In this state
of mind Robertson seized the opportunity, while Martin was at a

tance on shore, to excite still higher the feelings of rage and despair
that agitated the mind of young Lavalle. He expressed the greatest
sorrow for his heavy loss, and told him that Martin had defrauded him
out of his money by foul play, and consequently any means that could
be taken to recover it were perfectly justifiable. In short, he succeeded
in exciting the feelings of Pierre, till he agreed to entice Martin, who
was very intemperate, to drink that night to intoxication, and when
asleep from its influence, pitch him into the river, and divide the con-
tents of his portmanteau between them..
Night came. Pierre plied the gambler with wine until he appeared
to be in the last stages of intoxication, and sunk down by the side of
the boat feigning profound sleep. At a silent motion by Robertson,
young Lavalle, pale and trembling, pitched the body overboard, which
appeared to sink without a struggle. Pierre now brought forward
Martin's portmanteau, that they might divide its contents between them;
but what was his astonishment when Robertson not only refused any
share of the money, but expressed the utmost surprise and horror at the
deed, declaring that he had not entertained the remotest suspicion that
Lavalle really contemplated committing such a crime, or he would have
prevented it even by force.
It was in vain that the wretched, tortured young man protested that
Robertson had aided in the affair. The latter denied it with violence,
and uttered dark threats against him if he again repeated such a false-
hood. Pierre saw at once tl~at he had placed himself completely in the
power of Robertson, aud sought to soothe him by abject entreaty.
With apparent difficulty young Lavalle obtained from him a promise
that he would not reveal the story to any one living, so long as Pierre
tret~ted him as a friend. This was the utmost concession which the af..
ffioted youth could obtain from one whom he knew in his heart was as
guilty as he.
Young Lavalle, by the refusal of Robertson to' share with him, would
have the entire contents of Martin's portmanteau, which would contain
not only tlw~ money won from himself, but that which previously belong-
ed to the gambler. He opened the portmanteau, and was horror-struck
to f1n4 that it contained only rubbish. Not a dollar ~vas there! What
'he could have done with it or when disposed of it was a subject that ex-
cited their curiosity and amazement, but to Pierre it was a terrible
blow. He had been enticed by Robertson to comiimit the deed he had
done to regain the money of which he had been swindled. He had
placed himself in the power of Robertson, and yet had recovered noth-

ing. besidess this, and his dependence upon him at present for all pe.~
~uniary supplies, there was the consciousness of guilt bearing with a
mountain~ weight upon his soul.
All this affair had been planned between Robertson and Martin.
Robertson was to assist Martin by signs to win Pierre's money, which
they divided between them. In return for this service, Martin was to
feign himself drunk,.&amp;fter privately disposing of his money, and permit
himself to be throwii overboard by Pierre. He found not the slightest
difficulty in gaining the shore unperceived, leaving not a doubt on the
mind of young Lavalle that he had sunk to rise no more.
On the night of the murder of Pierre Lavalle, Robertson had con-
certed a pI~t with the latter by which Claudine would be placed in his
power. This plot was providentially overheard by Claudine, who was-
thus put upon her guard. Robertson, who lurked at that hour near, the
house, saw her in conversation with her uncle and aunt, from whom
she received an axe, which he saw her take into her sleeping apart.
ment, and heard her lock and barricade the door. He knew from these
circumstances that the plot was discovered, and doubted not that Pierre,
who had hesitated long between"the gallows and her betrayal, had .dis..
closed the plot to his sister; and he resolved to take deadly revenge up~
on both.
Returning to the outhouse occupied by Pierre, he found no difficulty
in inducing him to drink immoderately, and took the precaution to drug
his wine. Long before midnight his intended victim was stretched out
in his bed, in a profound 'sleep. Nothing but the dread of appearing
before God with the guilt of murder upon his soul had made him the
submissive slave of Robertson's will. On his knees he had implored
him again and again to spare his sistei~, but the monster; true to his
thirst for revenge, coldly bade him choose between obedience and death
on the gallows.
The room which Claudine now occupied had formerly been the sleep.
lug apartment of Pierre, and was thus occupied by him when Robert~.
son first arrived in St. Charles. He often slept there with young La-
valle', after having spent the night, to a late hour, in debauchery.
One day, in the .absence of Pierre, lie accid~*itally discovered that a.
short plank of the floor, directly under the bed, and concealed from oh'-
sOrvation, was loose.' On examination, it appeared probable that in lay.
ing the floor, a plank of suiuible length was wanting, and saw-mills at
that ~early period being few and far between, the deficiency was sup-
plied by putting down a short piece~ at a place where the defect would

escape notice. From some cause or other, but probably from an inten-
tion to supply its place with a ph~nk of the requisite length, that piece
had never been nailed to the sleep~r..
Robertson instantly resolved to turn this discovery to his own advan-
cage. The house was elevated so high above the ground, that by creep.
ing undet~ the floor, an entrance into the room through that aperture
would be easy. The uncle and sister of Pierre had already urged him
to break off all intercourse with Robertson, and the latter determined
that he would avail himself of the means which the short plank afforded
of gaining an easy access to Pierre as often as he pleased, without the
knowledge of the family. Being skillful in the manufacture of the
tools of a burglar, he soon constructed a spring that held the plank firm-
ly to its place. By pressing his thumb hard upon a knob connected
with the spring, under the floor, this ingenious trap-door opened with-
out noise. Every thing was so adroitly managed as to present no ap..
pearance of any contrivance.
On that night, when he saw that Claudine had become acquainted:
with the plot which he and Pierre had devised, the trap-door, which had.
long been forgotten, now occurred to his mind. He had never had any
occasion to use this secret entrance, and its very existence bad passed.
* from his recollection. He now resolved to employ it as the means of
deadly revenge upon both the brother and ~ister.
The solemn hour of midnight arrived. Stillness reigned over the
scene. The whole household was sunk in profound sleep. Not a light
was seen in the village, except at a single chamber, where a mother
kept watch at the bed-side of her sick child. Slowly and cautiously
Robertson crept under the floor of Claudine's apartment. He found the
fatal spring. Rust and time had nearly tendered it immovable. I-Ic
pressed 'hIs finger hard upon the knob, and at last the trap-door opened.
Creeping through that aperture, he stood erect at the bed-side of his in-
tended victim. The curtains of her window ~ver~ indeed, closely drawn,
but the full moon rode high in the clear and cloudless heavens, render.
ing every object in the room distinctly visible. Upon a chair, neatly
arranged~ lay the articles of her toilet, as she had placed them. on retir.~-
ing for the night. Directly over the head of her bed hung a crucifix,
a~d below it an image of the Blessed Virgin, to whose guardian care
she nightly committed herself and all she loved, with the most child-
like confidence and affection. He gazed long and earnestly upon c~lau-~
dire, who slept, unconscious of the presence of her deadly foe. The

,:barricaded door still rested, upon her lips. 11cr breathing was soft and
peaceful as that of an infant pillowed upon the bosom of its mother.
Taking with him the fatal axe, ltobertson descended and carefully
closed the trap-door. In examining the spot' to see that no marks or
traces were left that might lead to his detection, he discovered, that one
of her shoes and an article of her dress had fallen through the opening.
This suggested to him the idea ef employing them as evidence, against
her. Taking these with him, he repaired to the out-house, and placing
them near the bed, he perpetrated the foul murder of Pierre Lavalle, by
cleaving his skull asunder, inflicting numerous ghastly wounds, and fi.
nally severing the head entirely from the body. He then stained the
handle of the axe with the blood of his victim, replaced it under the bed
of Claudine, carefully fastened the trap-door, and 'then hastened from
the village. He arrived at Prairie Des Sioux before his absence was
discovered, or even suspected..
Such was the substance of that part of his confession which bears
an immediate Connection with this story. Hardly had he finished his
narration when he expired in great agony of body and mind, despairing
of the mercy of God.
Col. D'Iberville and his wife returned home, deeply affected with the
scene they bad witnessed. Claudine sought the soJitude of her cham-
ber, and throwing herself upon her knees, poured forth l~er gratitude to
that Power who had shielded her in the fearful hour of peril, and in his
own good time removed from her name the dark stains that rested on
it. Tears flowed copiously as the scenes of other years rose up in Viv-
id recollection before her. flut they were teats of gratitude, and de~
seceded upon her heart like the gentle dew-drops that evening shec~
upon the drooping flowers. The blight upon her name that had poison~
ed all her happiness was now removed. She had lived in continual
fear that some accident might disclose to the world that Madam lYlber.
yule, the honored, talented Madam D'Iberville, was no athe~. than the
Claudine Lavalle who had been condemned to death for the mu~de* of
her brother, and escaped the gallows only by the timely pardon otth9
(Thvernor. The disgrace which such a discovery would bring~ iipoii
their son, a high~spirited lad of eighteen, could not be contemplated
without dread. The thought would often steal over her, that her own
husband, fond and devoted as he had always been, had no proof of lid'
innocence but her bare word, and that in opposition to a jury of twelve
men, who cm their oath declared her guilty.
~ql~ D'Ibervjlle rejoiced in this happy event even more than his wife1

~To nee~led no new proof to convince him that "Sister MarieH a~
delighted in calling her, was little less than perfect.
Claudine descended to the parlor, and at her request, CoL D'lbevvilh~
i~olc their son into a private apartment, and disclosed to him the early
historyy of his mother. The young man was deeply affected, and, rush-
~ng into* the chamber to which his mother had retired, with his face
i~athed in tears, exclaimed, "Oh mother, mother, how much I love you
~or what you have snifered," and he kissed her again and again wi&amp;
fond affection. Her cup ot happiness now seemed full, and the long
$~ears ol' sorrbw she had endured were amply repaid by the joys of that hour.
Her cup was destined to receive another and an exquisite drop of
i.~appiness. As she descended again to the parlor, leaning on the arm
bf her husband and son, a loud knocking wa&amp; heard at the door. It
was opened, and the Superipr of the Sisters of Charity, whom she had
t~o lately visited, entered, and with her a venei~able ecclesiastic, appar.
~ntly bordering upon eighty years. It was the venerated priest of St..
charles, the good Father Laroche, the friend and guardian of Claudine
Lavalle. He felt that his pilgrimage on earth would soon close, and he
was anxious to place in the hands of Col. D'Iberville and his lady the
account ofhis inanagemeiit of her property, which had so niuch increas'-
~A in value. He ardently desired to behold once more on earth the or-
~han girl whom he had so fondly cherished, and also his sister, his on-
ly surviving kindred. Father Laroche had brought with him the final
i~ecision of the courts in his favor, as residuary legatee of the estate of
Claudine's father, to a tract of land, a Spanish gwant, which had beeom~r
immensely valuable. This property was now hers.
It need not be told with what emotions that venerable priest wa~ re~-
i;arded by all the family of Madam D'Iberville. They entreated him
o spend the remainder of his life with them, where they could have th~
happiness of paying him some small sifare o~ the immense debt of grat-
tude they owed him, for his' firm, unshaken confidence in the truthful
integrityy of Claudine Lavalle, when all things conspired to prove her guilt.
That night, as they were about to retire, this little household,, moved
)y the same impulse, threw themselves upon their knees, while thc
priest offered to the IThseen Power who had shielded, the iu~enSe or
gratitude. The venerable Father LarQche closed his benediction with
t~his affecting quotation from Scripture: "Once was I young, who ant
~tow old; but never yet kave I seen the wicked prr~per, the righteov~i
f@rsakcn."

her character open to the reader, that he may knowfuIly the heart of the
litde womaxi who is doome&amp; xo~xneet the buffeting oi the storm.
Let it n~ot be imagined that Sixteen Mile Prak~s so nearly resembled
Paradise, that the ttmbition of Mary l~'X ver$ck$#~o render her .hoxn~ at.
ttactive excited no envy, malice, or ili'wilL T~ s~rne of her neighbors,
and especially of her Own seX, the ~hrubbery and flowers of ~he litt~o
wOman were really gall r~d worm.wood. Unkind remarks upon the
uhje~t ~re not urtfrequently made to Mary herself bun more fre~
quently they reached her ear through the ofiicio~s zeal of some visitor,
who professed to be the defender of the abused Jittle WQiD&amp;fl, '~'hese
reports produced but a slight and momentary impression. upon the mind
of Mrs. Maverick, wh~ listened to thorn With n smile, an4 not un
frequently, when anything rixore than usually spiteful was ur~re4, burst
into a mery laugh, and in tem min~xtes forgot all about it. It was far
otherwise with her husband. He felt these~carpings of envy and malive
more deeply than he was willing to confess~ and it sometimes required
all her ~oothirj influence, which she knew well how to exert, to induce
him to refrain from openly expressing his resentment to her detractors.
One evening a neighboring lady called upon them, at a time when Mrs.
l~averick chanced to be watering a large and beautiful moss rose,
whose' numerous bi us filled the whole room with their fragrance.
"Is not that beai.uifnl, Mrs. Jones?" ex&amp;lairned the delighted husband
to their visitor, pointing to the rose. The walk of that lady through the
yard, between rows of shrubs and flowers, had already excited her ilb
hurnor~ which instantly broke forth at the rexn~rlt of the gratified hns~.
band. "Oh yes," she exclaimed, "beautiful, no doubt; but anybody
can have just suchjf they choose. I ~ouM plant shrubbery just a~well
as your wife, Mr. Mtiverick, but I have something else to dq. Mei.y

these pictures that hang up here on the wall; but u~hile she is clang ti~ia
I am making bitter and cheese, risixig my needle, or ~t~endizig to my

her household duties for these mnu~eni~nts~ was rather more ~ha~ the
patience of her husband, ccril4 bear. It was the drop to xrn~tclx tli&amp;

religious toleration. liesides, if thus denied the use of'the school house,
public sympathy would instantly be awakened in behalf 6f 'the preacher,
and a dozen houses at on6e be thrown open to him,, giving to MormonV
ism a teti-fold greater influence, than it would otherwise have. The sun
was hardly an hour high, and he ha:d rip time to go over the settlement
and try to persuade' the people not to attend the preaching, even if such a
course promised success~ At~ any ~rate, he could insure the abseiice of
one tatnily. His seat and that of his wife sI'. ould be vacant, and thus set
a silent, but most impressive 'seal upon the attendance 'of all who were
present-a' condemnation which would haire a decided influence against
Mormonism.' Such was hi~ resolve~ in the absence of 'all other means
of warding off the threatened calamity.
Few, perhaps, would have anticipated any opposition to this arrange-
ment from the gentle Mary~ lint oppose it she 'did.' She had felt no
desire to attend ~he meeting; but the moment her 'husband, in an arbi~
trar~r 'mann~r~ resolved, without consulting her at all, that she should
stay at home, an' ardent desire to hear the Mormon 'took possession of
her heart. She attempted to reason him out of' his exclusion, but in
vain. Though yielding as the sensitive plant at 'the' voice of ~kindness,
the little woman could be firm and immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar,
when her rights were disreg'.arded, and her feelings touched by a rude
hand. On such an occasion an instantaneous change came over her
~vhole being. She uttered no complaints, no reproaches, but her Whole
soul seemed to retire within itself.-
We cannot determine what course either of them would have pursued,
or which yielded, for just at this moment a new actor in the scene en-
tered, and changed the entire current of passing events.
This was no other than Frank Maverick, the youngest and favorite
brother, a warm-hearted, intelligent youth of seventeen, who carried
sunshine with him wherever he went, and was every 'where a welcum&amp;

Filled with excitement at the novelty of hearing a follower of Joe'
Smith, and eht'ed with the anticipation of seeing a crowd of people atthe

But, sister Mary," said the young man, gazing around with admiration~
"how beautiful your flowers have grown. If ever 1 look Out for a
wife, I mean to try to find one just like you, and the very flr~t question
I intend to ask her is, whether she is fond of flowers.". "Ah~ brother
Frank!" replied Mary with an arch smile, "I half suspect that you have
just come from taking a lesson on flowers from pretty Luey Mills, and
that she gave you the ruse you wear so jauntily in the button-hole of
your ve~t, just over your heart." The young man blushed deeply at
his shrewd guess of sister Mary, but laughed aloud, and, to conceal his
consciousness that she had hit the very truth, lie seized little Eddy, who
had run in- from the garden at the welcome sound of "Un~le Frank's"
voice, and s~vinging the chuid over his shoulder, trotted out of the house
with Eddy upon his back.

It was speedily settled that Frank, who would stay all night 'at the

persevered ikl 'his obstinate determination 'to remain at home with little

the trees and shrubbery of the yard, were pouring forth'matiy~t wi1d~

The feelings of Maverick 'were in unison with the scenery around
him. The dark, d5ep, mysterious for~1~odings of" the previous nigh&amp;
had ailvanished. His long hours of sleepless excitement were remem~
bered witfi astonishment and mortification at his owt~ weakness of mind~
The approaching 'visit of the Mormon was now regarded in 'it~ tine
ght, as an affair, indeed, of no earthly consequence, one way' or the'
other-a very trifiing, unimportant ~vent. He c6uld hardly believe it
possible that he could have given it a moment's attention.
After 'breakfast, Mr. Mav~'rick occupied himself with' labors in sight
of the house, in momentary expectation of the arrival of "the preacher.
Hour after houi' rolled by, and noon came, but no visitor. "He had -
promised to call early in the morning, and th.~y now concluded that he

objections. Had it been otherwise, Maverick would.have made a de..
cided effort W prevent it.
~No attempt was made that afternoon to. discuss the doctyines of the
Mormon ,~creed, but many preliminary inquiries about the sect, and of
their general character, were made. After tea, Maverick 'and Wiliner
set out for the place of meeting. . It was dark when th.ey arrived. ~'The
candles were already 'lighted up. A crowd bad' collected.. On theout.
side. of the hou~e, groups of men and full-grown boys were, clustered,
discussing in a loud tone the subject of the meeting. The .ru4e, coarse
jokes uttered against the Mormons were, received with boisterous ap-
plause.
The preacher passed through the crowd at the door, entered ~the
house, and took his seat at a desk on the opposite side of~ the room.
Giving .no heed to the, loud whispering and tittePrig, he commenced
by singing a hymn, after which he opened the Bikle,~and read~the tenth
chapter of Luke. To 'the disappointment 'of no small 'number, who
caine there for sport, instead 'oft a portion of the', Book of Mormon 'or
the Golden Plates, they heard only a deeply impressive chapter from
the. New Test~inent.. The reading ended, he paused for a moment,
then. saying, "let us pray," knelt, down. There was nothing in the
simple 'act of a minister's kneeling to excite attention, for the practice
was common. ,The whole congregation had been.. accustomed to. that.
mode froin~their infancy~ But the manner in which that sirt~ple act was
perEormed ~ the Morn~ion was striking. There was deep. humility of
soul. ir~ every attitnde~and inotioir. .It.seemed as. if he. wished to pros-
t.rate himself in the very dust before Him whom he was about to address.
But theprayer, the prayer itself, was still more striking and. peculiar.
Itwas uttered in a low, deep tone, but every ivord was distinctly audible
at the remotest corner of the room. He seemed to hava forgotten
that an audience was around him, prepared to criticise every. ,~or.d he
uttered, but appeared to remember only that he was in the presence
of the Deity.
Many of the serious portion of the congregation were affected, and
even the young men and overgrown boys, who came there for sport,
were awed 4nto silence.
He took .a 'text from the Bible, a verse of the same chapter that ~e
had just read. in a serm~m of nearly an hour and a half long, ,he ex-
plained the grounds upon which .the Iaatter-Day Saints, the followers of
'Jo Srniih%. founded their belief in Mormonism. These doctrines he
efended with an ingenuity of argument, and an eloquence that wanted

bt~t- the simple ingredient of irutk to r~d~r it ~ mo4el of i~t4i~it ~
Unexpectedly to all,. he professed t~ receive the QId and ~I~4~w ~Festa~
ments as the word of God, and drew from the j~ible it Wa~h4w ?rP~fs
which he adduced in support Of the Mormon cro~ed. ir~it~a~Wp pas~
sages were quoted by huiufrom the Bible, which he iagen~on~ly euq~k'yeti
to sustain their peciUiar doctrines, and 'like authenticity of ~he
Mbrinon. They termed themselves "t~atLer.4I)s.y Saints," 'he said, in
reference to the near approach of the "Latter Pay," when the 4ng~l,
with one foot upon the land and the other on the sea, should decla~
that time should be no longer. Many striking pa~sa~es of S~ripturo
were adduced in support of this, and especi~dly frcnl the prophetic.
books of the Old Testament. The last days of the earth were at their
very doors. With ingenious sophistry, various passages which lie quoted.
from the Bible were seemingly made to prove that, shortly btifore the
conflagration of the ~ vo4d, and the consummation of all thing ~, a new
revela~jor~ was to came to light, and a people arise, p~qf~ssirg a purer
faith, upon whom would be conferred the power 'of healingg' the sick~
speaking in unknown tongues, and performing va4ous other i~iiraeles.
This sermon was delivered with all that earnest fervor which .~su~l~y
characterizes the words and action~ of him who is thQroughly conyineed
of the truth of what he utters, and de~ply'~feels its iInportane~.. .411'

Upon the mind of no one, perhaps, was there made so profound an

citeinent began to prevail. FWe men, with their wives, all of whom
were mem era ~f'otthedox churches, came forward, and publicly con-
fessed themselves converts to Mormonisin. These were baptized by
Mr. Wiltuer, for the Mormons acknowledged not the validity of the
rite. performed by any sect or denomination.' After this they were
received 'into the church of the Latter-Day Saints. Other candidates
Were expected soon to follow. The opposition to Mormonism now broke
forth with redoubled violence.
Good ,m~n looked on with fear and trembling, for no one knew where
this delushn would end.. None of'the oppos~rs of that sect were more
implacable and unrelenting in their hostility to Mormonism, in all its
various phases, than was Judge Maverick. He was a man of a sound
head, and of sincere piety, but without a~ particle of charity for Joe
7-Sinith, or any intelligent man who preached his doctrines. He 1?Iamed
his son James, severely blamed him, for harboring Wilmer, or listening
to his preaching. Not even the hospitality shown to him by that man
could justify' him for inviting him to his house. The mother of young
Maverick 'wept over him, and with anguish of heart implored him to
'avoid the Mormons, for it would "kill her and his wife both," she said,
if he should be deluded by their sophistry, and join the odious sect.
James *as already aware of the feelings of Mary upon that subject,
for, though she had forborne from speaking of the Mormons for a long
time past, yet' the increasing paleness of her countenance, and her de-
jbcted 'appearance, 'betrayed the deep anguish with Which she beheld
his frequent associations with the Latter-Day Saints. He was greatly
affected at the sight of his mothers tears, for he had never before seen
her weep as she did now, and solemnly promised her that he would go
no more to 'their meetings, and hold no more intercourse with any of
the sect1
The joy of his mother at this promise of her son was great. 'She
went directly to his house, and communicated the intelligence to Mary,
who was 'nearly overcome with this' 'unexpected happiness. She em-
braced her mother~in-Iaw, ~nd wept tears of joy and hope upoii her
bosom1
Young ~Maveticl faithfully kept his pledge, much to the grief and
sore disappointment of Wilmer and the rest of the Mormons residing
in 'that settlement, who had counted largely upon the weight and influ-
ence which his joining them would'~giv-e to Mormonism in that region.

He kept this engagement far more easily 'thtui he would have done,

Several months have gone by siAce the departure of Whiner from'
the settlement of Sixteen Mile PraiAe, in which period the ~ver-~ary-
i~~ig features of Mormonism have assumed still another hue. "The
G~ft of Tongues," as it was styled, no longer confined to one or two of
their most popular preachers, had even become general. The most
illiterate of their members, men and women who were unable to read
a single wdrd of their own native English, and even children, c6uld
prophesy fluently, it was said, in Hebrew, Gteek, Chaldee, '~yria6, an4
numerous other lai~guages. This was no~ attempted at all ~their' med-
ings. Sometimes, the individual wh~ uttered the strain of u~hi~i~
sounds professed to give the meaning, himself, in English; ~htit more
&amp;6mnionly, the "interpve~ation," as it was called, was given by ~Oxne' one
else. The excitement of the public mind was manifested by scenes of
violence which no native American can remember without shame and
mortification, for mobs and lynch law became the order of the day.
But these violent and illegal measures had the effect which all attempts
to change the religious opinions of men by physical ' force ever have
had. In frequent instances, the meetings of 'the Mormons for public
worship, though held in their own houses, were broken up; and fortunate
indeed were the inmates if they escaped aiiy worse outrage. In vain
did the victims appeal for 'protection to the laws of their country.
Our institutions, which guarantee the freedoni of religious 'ophii6n to
the Jew, the Mahometan, the Pagan, and even to the ./It1,eis#,' afi~rded'
no protection to the Mormon. Their own dv~"eIlings might be iiivaded~
their wives and daughters insulted and abused, their windows brok-e1~

in, and in UIQ~O tJ~a~zi Qne instance, their houses bi~rnt do .vn over their
heads, with perfect impunity. Few magistrates will risk the certain
loss of votes at the next election, merely to protect the rights of men
without influence, against the injustice of tI~e muit~tu~1e, whe~hr these
hapless victims of mob law art Mormons or not.
But the Latter-Day Saints increased but' the mere rapidly Lex these
persecutions, and the consequence of it was, that prosel.ytes were added
to their church in nearly every place that their preachers visited. Some
few of the Mormons, even at this early period, had lost their lives, and
most of them held life and property only at the will of an American
mob.
Under the direction of Joe Smith, the Latter-Day Saints had settled,
in great numbers, in one of the counties of Missouri, high up the river
of the same name. Here it was the intention of the Prophet ~o found
a Mormon colony, which should become the permanent "Head Quar-
ters" of the Order Lor all time to come. Many hundred families had
arrived there from the various States of the Union, purchased ~ piece
of land, 'a~nd witW gi~eat industry applied therns~elves to i~s cultivation.
At the period of which we are 'now speaking, the p~qp~e of that part of
Missouri had, not lQng before, assembled em mass~, 4rive~i these Mor-
mons from their homes, and compelled them to leav t.~e~ion. They-
gave them permission, however, to settle in a 91eu) 4I4~ uminWibited
county of the State, on the extreme frontier, adjoining the territory of
various savage tribes; pledging their honor to the Mormons, that in that
distaut retreat they 'should never be molested.
Conducted by 'the Prophet, who marched at their head, always ready
tu share~ with his PAlowers whatever toils and dangers awaited them~
these Mormon Pilgrims, with their wives and children, and the scanty
remains of earthly goods still left them, took up the long and melancholy
line of their march to the Indian frontier. Here they applied them~eWes
with the persevering industry that has ever formed a distinguishing
trait in the character of the sect, and before ma:ny moons had wamed and
waned, every thing in that wild region h~d assumed a new and plea-
sing ~ppearance. Each family had its own allotment of ground, upon
which there soon arose- a neat dwelling, and~ variouS other improve-
ments.
But the M~rm0ns scatts~ied over the United StRt~s, most of them the

the Prophet. To effect that -purpose, he resolved to call them all,~with
as little delay as possible, to that place,, wl~ich he had established as
the' "Zion" of the sect. Smith had a new revelation ftom Heairenin-
forming him 'that the time was now neat at hand'when the Destroying
Angel would pass over the earth, when the wicked should be cutoff in
their sins, and the saints above possess the earth. M~sengers were
sent in every direction, where Mormon converts were found, to proclaim
to them, in the word~ of the Prophet, "came out from among the wicked,
my people, for why willye perish, with them-come up to the Zion
which the Lord thy God has establishecV for his saints." The unbelie-
ving world, too, must be warned forthe last time: "get ye up, flee to the
mountains, lest ye be con&amp;uraed; for the great and terrible day of God's
wrath is coming quickly, when the unbelieving world shall be utterly cut
off." Such were the messages to "saint ner," proclaimed abroad
by the preacher sent out by Smith. Nor was the mission fruitless in
converts. Instead of ~iirging the people, as formerly, to ~mbrac~ their
doctrines, they' now assumed a different 'tone, ~v~rnimig th~tn not to
joih'the ranks of~ 'the tatter-t~ay Saints, unless they were ready t~. lay
down their lives, like the martyrs of old and seal the bonds o~ faith
with their 'own' blood. Other sects, said they, could i~epose on "flowery
beds" of ease," but the Latter-Day Saints have nothing tO expect from
the world but persecution and death. 'And this language' was not
out effect; for such is human nature, that persecution and bloodshed'have
always increased the persecuted sect. Employ force and violence to
put down the ~vild~-st delusion that fanaticism ever invented, and you
in'~vitably insure its success. The h story of the world attests tha~t fruth.
It is strikingly verified in the case of the Mormons. Hundreds whb
ridiculed the absurdities of that creed when its followers were unmo-
lested, fell directly into the snare of Mormonism v~rhen their sympathies
were awakened by seeing them calmly enduring persecution and death
for the cause.
In all human probability, had, the followers of Joe Smith been left
to pursue the dictates of- their own consciences, unmolested and undis-
turbed, as so many other religionists
do-in all prob'                 ~equally absurd have done, and yet
ability, had not the Mormons, been assailed with perse-
cution, the plunder of their property by American lynch law, and n~ade

he was aroused from his reverie by the voice of his wife, calling him by
name. Alarmed at hjs long absence, 4e had sought him ~t the 'house'
of their nearest neighbor, and there earned that near sunset he had
been seen sitting down in his field, and thither she hastened, in the
utmost alarm. The ~cold dews on his thin dress had chilled him, and
when aroused by the voice 'of his wife, he shivered like one under the
influence of the ague. 'Yo her anxious inquiries, he merely replied
that h&amp; was unwell; begged~ her to feel no disquietude on his account,
and accompanied her to the house. Mrs. Maverick kneW itothing of
his interview with the old preaclIer in' the field, and had not the slightest
suspicion that the subject of Mormonism occupied his Ihoughts. For
several months he had attended none' of their meetings, and avoided
having any intercourse with the members, and most devoutly did she
thank God that he had escaped their 'si~iares. She' did not even dream
that the fearful warnings of the old preacher, and his denunciations of
impending destruction, at that very moment agitated her husband's
mind, nearly driving him to frenzy and despair. She attributed his long
stay in 'the field' to sudden illness. and would have employed a'ineighbor
to go for the physician, but this he' peremptorily forbid, 'assuring her
that he would be entirely well again after a night's rest. At supper,
to quiet the fears of his wife, he attempted to eat,' but the effort~ wa~
beyond his power to accomplish. Food w~s loathesoi~e to his' sight.
He drank part of a cup of tea, and retired to bed. Mary would have
prepared for him some of the prescriptions which she had 'so often found
efficacious, but he declined taking them. To avoid further importunities'
of his anxious wife, he closed his eyes and feigned sleep.
It was' a long and dreary night to James Maverick. Every moment
when awake, the" warning voice of the aged.. Mormon was sounding its
fearful knell in his ears, telling him of his doom. Every look, every
gesture of the old preacher was still present to his view. The moment
he fell into asluinber, the woe~ denounced upon him by. the white-haired
priest 'were a~l living realities, and thefr fulfillment was already begun.
He saw th&amp; separation made between the "sheep and the 'goats"~-4he
wicked cut off-and none now remaining o~ the face of The purified
earth but the Latter-Day Saints, who w~ere the sole tenants of a sinkss
w6rld, 'prepared for their reshtence alone.
In the morning, Maverick rose at dawn, and mechanically perforrn~d
the usual jobs about the ~iou~e. At breakfast he ate little, and his wife
saw wit alarm his haggard appearance. Shortly" afterward complain-
ing of head-ache, he laid himself upon the bed. In an hour more, a

During the early part of 'his illness, Maverick neither spok6 'iwr
uttered a single. ~~ord, or an exclamation of pain. He lay silent and
still, his glaring eyes fixed, with fdgl~tfiil intensity, upon vacancy.
his lips moved, at times, as if he were talking to the invisible being
upon which he gazed, but no sound was heard.
At length, a change came over the suffering patient. He began to
move restlessly in his bed, and at times muttered wildly and incohe..
rently.
One night, during this period in his disorder, about an hour after
friidnight, Mary and Judge Maverick were-keeping watch, alone; in the
sick room. The mother, worn out with fatigue and anxiety, had retired
to rest in an.adjoihing room. A' neighboring woman, who had dome
there to watch' for the night, finding 'it impossible to keep awake; had
lain 'down upon the bed iii which slept the elder Mrs. Maverick, and

burning ~fever was raging in his veins. A messenger was sent to his
parents,~who imin~diately dispatched Frank for Dr. Horion; ~d 'set ~i1i
instantly for flue h9use of their sep. When 'they arrivea, James gazed
long and' earnestly upon his father, and mother, but there was no' intel-
lignce in the glazed' eye he cast upon his pareias. He did nof kn6w
them.
The doctor, on examining the symptoms of his patient, pronounced his
disorder a. br ai ~i fever, 'a~nd immediately went to work, with vigor and
skill, to combat the disease. He shaved the patient's head, applied blis-
ters, and ~employed 'other means of a dePletory character. But faint
hopes of his i'e cpvery were entertained by Dr. Horton.
For days the attendance of the physician was unremitting, except
for an hour or two daily, when he returned home for a few minutes,
and' made a brief visit to a. patient near by, who was conv~iescent, a
out of all danger.
Little Eddy, at the commencement of his father's illness, was sent to
,the care of 11 is aunt, that the undivided attention of his mother might
be bestowed upon her sick husband. Judge Maverick passed the nights'
at the house of his son, a'nd on his return home in the morning, Frauk
was sent there to assist his mother and Mary during the day, an4 that
hc might be l)resent, should any unexpected emergency arise to de-
mand his aid. These two women, the wife and the mother, were
constantly nt the bed-side of the sick man, except when exhausted nature
required repoSe, when in turn they snatched a few hours of rest.

was instantly Last asleep. All was still throughout the house, a:'.d not a
sound was heard but The heavy breathing of the sick man. Suddenly he
.tarted-raised himself up in the bed, threw his naked arms wildly
around, and cried out, in the most appalling tones ever uttered ~by
mortal voice, "The judgment! the judgment has come! Hark! its jeai
is suun~ling!" At that very instant a thunder storm that had long
been rolling up unperceived by them, suddenly burst forth in a blinding
flash, followed by a peal of thunder that seemed to shake the solid globe
down to its very core. Mary heard something fall heavily behind her.
Judgo Maverick had fainted. But she had no time to attend to him,
for her husband, in his insane ravings, was attempting to rise from his
bed, and rush out into the storm that was now raging with violence.
She dared not call aloud for aid, lest her cry should render the frenzy
of her delirious husband uncontrollable. Seizing a pitcher of water that
stood near her, on the table, she dashed its contents into the face of
Judge Maverick, and instantly resumed her place at the bed-side of the
maniac.
fI~he Judge quickly revived, and sat up. Happily, the thunder clap
awoke the mQther, who hastily put on her clothes and repaired to the
sick room.
All the remaining part of that long, long night, the patient raved in
delirium. It was no .v, for the first time, that his wife ~nd parents be-
came aware of the visit of the Mormon preacher to young Maverick,
in the field. His ravings disclosed to them the startling fact, that the
awful denunciations and warnings of the aged priest had unsettled his
reason, and were still preying upon his life. In his delirium, the sick
man repeated all that th~ Mormon had utterQd, and often called aloud
to the old man, implp+ing him, in the most moving terms, to have mercy
upon him, and spare him from the doom he had pronounce1.
In the 2 urse of the night, his ravings suddenly changed. He n-ow
iiytagined that father and mflher, wife and child, had all res )lVed to
leav&amp;hirn if he united with the ~ [ormons, and he implored his wife, by
th memory-of their early love-by all his undying affection for her, and
for their ouXy child, not to cast him off. His supplications to Mary were
heartrending, and almost beyond her powers of endurance, though she
was Lully aware that his entreaties to her were only the ravings of a
disordered intellect. She threw her arms around his neck, and weeping
upon his bosom, exclaimed, "Oh no! no! my poor, afflicted husband!
I will never leave you, never cast you - oft', nevi~~ desert you. In sorrow
and affliction, in woe and misery, I will ever be yours. Father and

mother may spurn you, the whole world may scoff at you, my poor
husband, but Mary kill be your comforter. Even the wild delusions o~
Mormonisin, that have so cruelly destroyed your reason, and made
shipwreck of our happiness, shall not separate us. Like Ruth of old,
"whither thou goest~I will go, and your God shall be my God." Should
reason never again return to you, and I fear it nevei' will, your head
shall still be pillowed upon the bosom of your own true Mary, .e.ven more
fondly than in the days of our early love."
While Mary was uttering these words, and for some minutes after,
the maniac gazed so intently upon the face of his wife, that her heart
thrilled with the hope that lie at length knew her and comprehended
what she had uttered. But her hopes were deceived. No lucid interval
had yet dawned upon that disordered mind. On the contrary, his frenzy
soon became still more wild and terrific. In the new mood of his d&amp;li-
rium, he imagined that he stood, with the assembled universe, before
the Judge of quick and dead, to hear his final doom. He had bar-
tered the salvation of his soul, merely to please his wife and parents.
The throng of glorified spirits who had triumphantly perished at the
stake, or been torn in pieces by wild beasts, joyfully embracing martyr-
dom-all these, as they heard his story, turned upon him a look of
withering scorn, and cried "fool! .fool /" As the demons, at the conE-
mand of his Judge, hurled him, shrieking, into the fathon~less abyss,
myriads of infernalshapes howled at him till every cavern of the gloomy
vault echoed back the cry, "fool I fool I fool !',
He raved thus till near dawn, then gradually sunk into a caluX and
tranquil sleep that lasted many hQurs. Dr. Horton frequently went to
his bed-side, during this interval, and anxiously examined the pulse of
the patient, for this he believed to be the crisis of his disorder, from
which he would rapidly recover, or immediately sink into the grave.
There was another fear that haunted the mind of the doctor, which he
dared not breathe to others-thc fear tuat his patient would become a
confirmed maniac.                       -  -
It was near the middle of the afternoon when the sick man awoke.
None were in the room but the parents and wife of the patient, and Dr.
Horton. He opened his eyes and gazed for a few moments npon the
group at his bed-side, and inquired if he had been very sicl~., Thenr
was sanity of mind in that look, and every heart in the - room, beat with
joy and thankfulness. Other questions from the sick man followed, ali
of which manifested a return of reason.

We shall pass over the incid~ts of the journey to. 'gie ~Morniom Zi-
on, and e~n omit the occurrence~ of the next two years after their ar~
rival. Yet these two year~ were marked with signal events to the 'Moi~-
inons. Great nutabers of th~ ~Latter-Day Saints had gather~e4t~wr~.
from the various States of the great American-Republic, and some from
nearly every Kingdom of Europe.
With the untiring industry which that sect has manifested at every
place they have yet occupied, this wild frontier wilderness had been
converted into fruitful fields. Smiling cottages had sprung up on ev~
cry side, as if by magic. Each family had its own allotment of~ ground~
and peace and plenty shed their hallowed influence around this commu~~
nity. The surplus products of their labor were e~~hanged with their
merchants and mechanics for such articles as they needed, while their.
printing press gave them weekly intelligence of the far-off land which
they had left; besides supplying them with books that taught ~thern the'
laws and doctrines of their sect, with the revelations of :their rrophet.
Missionaries had been sent out, two and two, even into regions beyond.
the Atlantic,. and hardly~a place diii they yisit, whirl faled 'of adding
new converts to iVEormonism.
Bitt even here, where the Latter-Da~y Saints had come under asol-
enin pledge that they should not be molested-~-eveivhere they found
no~ abiding place. It was resolved to drive them from the region which
their' own labor had rendered valuable, or exterminate the whole sect.
Td' justify this meditated outrage upon the rights of native born
Atrrerican citizens, the wildest tales were put in circulation against
that'pe~ple. They were described as thieves and~ assassins~ Men of
bad character, who had been expelled by the lVtormons, gratified their
revenge by publishing. infamous reports. Strange. as it may seem, one
of the most. 'effective means employed to inflame the public mind to the
point of dri~~~ing these peoplee from the land~ whirh they had honestly
.purehased,~was the report~ ~thati~no Mormon could be punished for his"

libel upon our republican government, and is unworth'~r of the nipzie of
an American citizen. ~Fo Aeclare that under a republican government
there is no power to punish robbery and murder-none to protect the
innocent-is equivalent to saying that such a government as ours ir
utterly worthless. This is acknowledging the truth of the charges
which the despots of Europe bring against our free institutions.
Nothing can be more' false than the assertion, that the Mormons, of
any other class of men, cannot be tried, and if guilty, punished. Every
Ameriran, not profoundly, ignorant, knows that when there is any fear
that men suspected of crimes cannot receive justice in the county in
which they reside, the laws themselves provide that these men shall be
removed, for trial; tQ some county where no such feat- ~xis~s. Will any
base slanderer of bur free institutions have the impixd~nce to assert, that
the people of Missouri and Illinois were so utterly corrupt and debased,
that a single county could not be found in those two States, where the
people were sufficiently honest to punish a Mormon, or any other crim~
inal, if found guilty? The authors of these bloody outrages believed no
such thing, for when Joe Smith, the Prophet and founder of that sect,
voluntarily surrendered hiniself for trial in ~ county where he and the
.Morrnons 'had not a single friend, did they try hinA 'No! lie was
basely, cowardl~i murdered in prison.
It is often asked why it is that respectable citizens applaud these
outrages, and other specimens 9f American Lynch Law, if these deeds
of violence and blood are not justifiable. - The answer is. obvious.
For, 'the very same reason that respectable men in' France applauded Ro-
bespierre and Marat, when in their hearts they loathed these monsters
-a want of moral courage.
But we will return to the narrative of passing events, from which a
desire to vindicate the republican institutions of our country from slander
and abuse has drawn us.
Some dissensions had arisen among the Mormons themselves, and
several families were on the point of abandoning the society, when in-
telligence came to Zion, that a large band of armed men was approach.
ing that town, to extermipate, themq In an instant every 'dissension
was hushed, and'those who, but a moment before, were at deadly feud
with their brethren threw themselves upon their knees at the feet of
those they had wronged, and with tears implored their forgivenesss.
Thero is nothing better calculated to unite people together, than the ex.
pectatioh df ~ouring out their blood as ~nartyrs in the same cause.

overwhelming force. We are net writing the history of the Mormons,
and ~shall give no details of that affair, except what belongs immedi-
ately to the Mavericks.
Mary, in the midst of the furious assault, continued to hide little
Eddy behind the forge of a blacksmith shop that stood next door to
their dwelling. Eddy, who had grown to be a boy of unusual intelli-
gence and manliness of character for a child of his age, begged hard
to be permitted to stand by the side of his mother, and share her fate,
but this the anxious parents refused. Hardly had the boy been securely
I)laced in that covert, when his father's dwelling was fiercely ass~iiled,
and Maverick, pierced with no less than four rifle balls, fell across his-
own door sill. Mary had just raised the head of the dying man in
her lap; anl heard his last sigh, when a cry of exultation rose from the
adjoining blacksmith shop. Eddy had been discovered, and was drag-
ged forth by a young man, whose real name we shall conceal under
that of Vorne. Mary, with all the energy of her soul, implored them to
spare her child, her only child, all that was now left to her widowed
heart, pointing to her husband, who lay dead at her feet, in a pooi of
blood. But Eddy, even in this fearful hour, disdaining all supplications
for his life, proudly drew up his form to its utmost height, and said,. "I
am. an ./lmerican!" Poor, mistaken, deluded child-he had read the
history of his country, and vainly supposed that the very name of
"./Jmerican" would throw around his- rights a shield of adamant. But
the proud claim of the boy, and the wild pleadings of the young mother,
were alike disregarded. Vorne replied, with a coarse, fiendish laugh,
"kill the young wolves, and there will be no o'ld ones!" Saying this,
he coolly and deliberately brought his rifle within a foot of the child's
head, and blew out his brains, sprinkling the clothes of the mother with
the blood of her own child.
Let no one suppose, even for an instant, that the sceiie just described
is a fiction. For the honor of manhood, we do niost devoutly wish it
were~ IBut we assure the reader that every incident related, however
i~evohing, is strictly true. The slaughter of the father, the concealment
and discovery of the boy, his proud claim, "I am am .,~mericam"-th6
reply of Vorne, and the blowing out of the child's brains before the eyes
of the agonized mother, all occurred just as it is here related. No hu-
man consideration would have tempted the writer to fabricate a fiction so
revolting. But it is truth, and should be told.

of the re erar~d rousing against the perpetrators of these crimes the,
indignation ~f ~every true-hearted American, who prizes the free institute.
tions of his native land.
We shall likewise pass over the tearless ag~ny of Mary Maverick, who
threw herself upon the dead bodies of her husband and child, and iq~-
plored them in mercy to kill her also. Nor will we pause to describe
her flight from *er burning home, snatching only from thence a small
bundle, containing a few articles rendered holy to her by the remem-
brance of little Eddy and her husband.
For an hour, the widowed, childless Mormoness fled into the wild
forest, nearly bereft of reason. Overcome with fatigue, she sat down
~t the mouth of one of he low, narrow caves ~o common in that upland
region. Resting her weary limbs for a few moments, she tried to collect
her thoughts, and inquiry~ what were the claims of duty; even in that fear-
ful emergency Concealing her bundle as far as possible in that cave,
with the intention of saving from the profane hands of strangers that
which had been dear to her child, she departed, she knew not ~vhither.
Women and children equally forlorn were fleeing n every direction, with
no aim but that of escaping, as fast as possible, from their assailants.
Mary soon joined a band of these fugitives, and sought to forget her
own sorrows in her efforts to console those whose afflictions were heavier
than her own. Destitute of food and shelter, they dared not solicit
either in the vicinity of their late residence, and these helpless outcasts
endured untold sufl~rings. But, as they proceeded farther from the
scene of their disasters, on their way to the Mississippi River, they
found that compassion had not yet forsaken the human heart. The
sympathies of the better class of the people of Missouri were powerfully
excited, and the doors of every respectable house on their route were
thrown wide open to the sufferers. Their wants were supplied with a
liberal hand, and no kind efforts spared to ~soothe their afflictions~
Though the public voip~. may actionn the outrages of "Lynch Law,"
yet every really honest. ma~ e~eora1~s, in tie ~ecret recesses of his own
heart, the lawless deeds that b~irig down reproach upon our free institu-
tions~ inforeign lands. ~ was emphatically the case in the present
instance, and s~ympath~zing friends of the Mormons, as there~would have
done for any other sufl'erers, sprung up on every side. T1~e most re-
spectable people in Illinois took the lead in this xnanifestati6sytnpathy,
and invited these homeless outcasts~ to settle i~ that State, on the bank of
the Mississippi, not far from the town of War~aw: ~PJ48 ~;is l'e foun-
dation of Nauvoo.


Mrs. Maverick was everywhere received with the utmost kindness.
~he tittered no coxhplaint~, atid 'never spoke either of her own wrongs
and sufferings, or those of the Mormons, ~rhen she 'could well avoid it.
She made no allusion, however distant, to her cruel bereavement of hus-
band and child, mit attempted ~o appear calm, and even cheerful, that
she might hide from the world the sorrows which none could assuage .
Yet a single glance at her pale, subdued countenance, told every obser.'
ver that the iron had entered deep into her heart. There wa~ a 1o~k of'
uncomplaining sorrow, mingled with the unfailing gentleness of her
tones and manner, that touched the. beholder. No one could see her,
ev~n in a crowc~ without feeling a singular attractionn toward the pale
stranger. A young merchant of considerable 'wealth, and of high stand-
ing in community, at whose mother's house the young~ Mormoness found
a shelter in the hour of her greatest need, felt that~ attraction irresistible.
lie offered to the homeless widow his hand and fortune, with the assu-
rance that her rdigious opinions should ever be sacredly respected. This
generous offer the Mormoness declined with profound humility, but
decidedly, much as she esteemed him for his many virtues. All the
promise that he could extort from' her 'was, that she would accept from
him any pecuniary aid that she might at any time find needful.
The Mormoness, feeling the impropriety of remaining any longer un-
der th~ roof of her kind benefactress, after this declaration of her son,
was compelled, once 'more, to go out into the world, and seek a new
home. With the Latter-Day Saints she knew that she would ~e~eive a
cordial welcome, but they had lost their all, and found iLdifficult to
provide even for their own wants. She resolved, therefore, to return; ds
soon as possible, 'to the settlement ~f Sixteen Mile Prairie, and seek
a home in the family of Judge Maverick, her father-in-law. ' Her
thoughts had often turned toward them, and she knew full well that un-
der their roof she would receive a heart-felt iec~ption, as a 'daughter
dear to their hearts. ilut she had long hesitated' to return thither, fear-
ing 'that ~he remembrance of other days, of herhusband' and child, 'would
awaken, in that place, sorrows beyond evem~ her power of endurance.
l3tit 'her heart had now been disciplined in the school of suffering ~nd
r~signati6n, till ~rt length she could look with calmness ulion trials 'that
would onc~ have bowed her to th~arth. "

~Qr a time, ~n the Wissxo~ family. The Jndi~ns~ ~ttne W~ thei~ ~1:pn~se,
set theziselyes earnestly at WO11~ to build her a ~ho W5~ net
a little, surprised to find ths~t it bid fair tob~ far the hest in ~ l~e~
ThQ agent procure such 'material~ and workmen as the'Th~ans'couid
not well provide. - The house was large, for it was designed ~y-Xtf
for a school, as ~vell as for hei pirate residence
In a short time the Indians becajije warmly attached to Mrs. l~&amp;rer-
ick, who was constantly among th~m; wherever an oppo~tun~tj ~f' d~ing
good presented. A few weeks of earneSt' ~pphcatnon had e~aWed her
to speak their language fluently, on all ordinary subjects a~&amp; 'is ~4ded
much to her influence. With the girls who ~tt~nded c~i9~Jit was
a ~vonk of love to learh. Their d6rk fac~s bearne~Vw ~6nfIdence and'
affection, I ~vhenever hey were turned toward their t~ch~er,~und she was
known in tkn village by the Indian name which they ~f~ied ~on her,
and which was one of the most affectionate terms in tli6 whole compass
of the Shawnee language. Every wish of hers w~s obeyed by these
girls, and, unconsciously to themsdves, they imitated her in everything,
even in her gestures, and the tone of ~er Voice. She sdught to inspire
-them with a love for the Irue and the bc2zutiful, as one -of the most
effi~ctive means of improving their minds. '~he adorned the 'yard. of the
school house with the shrubs and flowers that grew w, id in that region~
and it was deemed a sufficient reward to the most diligent and meritori-
Gus scholar, to be permitted to assist her i~ these recreations.' The. im~
proveme!it of these Indian girls soon became visible in the netttness and
taste seen in their own homes.
'But even there, where the Mormoness devoted herself to th~ slng~
pui~~ose of doing good to others, without a selfish thotight enteringlier
heart, - she was not doomed tO escape ew.ry and detraction.' -Some
whites oppose every attempt to instruct the 1ndians~ because they deem
it injurious to their own traffic. Even the family of the kind-hearted. -
pious missionary remembered that rshe was a Morgioness, and notall her
deeds of 'charity and love, could induce them to look upon her with etitir.
cordiality. JI~eports, false and g~ound1ess, began to be whispered-among
the Indians, and a few withdraw their daughters 'from the school. All
this' she met in silence, for she' neither sought nor e~pe~ted ha~ppiiiem
from' any other sourc~j than the consciousness of having faithMly dis-
charged her duty,, and no power upon earth could divest her~of that.

inou~t~r~tinction. The ~witrr'ior, who had been the xictoi~ in a hint-
de~~t~1its, p~ai1ed-at this neW 'and re8istless eneniy. Great numlets
died iii ~. ~evLr 'hours after the attack, afid consternation wirs universal.
AI~ who were able fled' from the unseen foe, to seek protection amoiig
tiriy~ bf i~h~ 4i~tant tribes that would receive them. Whole families per-
i~h~d in ~i$i' flight, and the unburied remains of the victims ~f that
terriWe s~o~frge lay scatteredd over the plains. A party of near fifty, in-
c1udirt~ men, w&amp;men and children, fled to the Shawnees, who compelled
them to ericatrip oX 'the distance of two miles from their village. It
was invain that thes savages had 'fled'from the pestilence. Fatigue
and 'terror predisposed them to the cholera, which broke out among them
on their arrival, with redoubled violence. None of the Shawnees would
visit their' encampnrenb and none of the afflicted tribe were permitted to
approach thevillage.     human appearance, the whole encampment
~was doozne4.. hi this emergency, the young Mormoness resolved to fly
to die as~istarrce of these friendless savages. No persuasion could shake
her resolution. ProcuriAg from the agent the few medicines prescribed
for the cholera, she took a large bundle containing such articles as she
'would most need, and comitiendirig herself to the protection of heaven,
she carefully closed the doors and windows of her house, which' she
might never again enter, and then departed for the encampment of the
savages. 'On her way,, she met the wagon of the mission family, who
were hastening toihe white settlements of Missouri. They paused long
'enomfgh to reproach 'the heroic woman with "lempt'ng Providence," by
rashly exposing her own life in such an enterprise. Unmoved by this
detmnciation~steadfast 'in ~her purpose, she resolutely pursued her way.
Death, in the frightful fo(~u o~ cholera, might await her, but, whether
~1ife or death was to be her lots,' she f~lt that the path of duty was always
the.'path of safety, and the olily Oae.,
Great was the astonishment of these savages, when they saw a female
ot beautiful form, apparently' twenty4oar or five years of age, in a snow
white -attire~ ~mddenly appear' among them,'arid; in the Shawnee tongue,
inform them that she caine to attend upon iheir sick. The smile with
whichehe announced this unexpected' message, 'g&amp;~e to'her pale counten-

Mormoness went instantly to wtrk in aid of the sufferers~ The it~

did they swallow the nauseating drugs that she administered, within a
word ~ inquiry, and in full confidence of recovery, for they~~believ~d
there was life in every medicine administered by her hand. Uultnly,
and with a light, quick step, ~the young Mormoness moved among~the
sick, giving medicine to one, v~iping the cold, clammy dew~ front 'fhe
forehead of another, and holding to the fevered 'lips of a third the cooling
draught6, To~ all she spoke words of hope and consolation, that cheered
and comforted their responding hearts.
In a few'days, the sick were all convalescent. None had died since~
her arrival, except' those whom she had found in the' last stages of tht~t'
fearful 'disorder. They now began' to be in want oP the neces~ri~ii ~?
'ife, aiA the Shawnees still prohibiting all communication with the ~i1~
lage, Mary dispatched a trusty ~messenger to her house in the night, to
bring from thence her whole supply of provisions, which, hapPi~ for
them, was not a small one.
Ingratitude is not among the vices of savage Iif~. It is only ir~ t1~e
society of the civilized and refined, that man repays the kludness of a,
friend and benefactor with hatred. These Indians madb no loud and
boisterous professions of thankfulne~ to t'he Mormoness, but gratitude.,
deep land heartfelt, be~xned in every look 'they .gave her. O~ie. of her
patients was a savage of powerful frame. regarded among them as the~
bravest warrior of the tribe. ' None who recovered was so violently, at.
tacked with the cholera as he. For some time jielay niotiouless, and ap.
parently insensible, but,' though unable toniJve,~or 'artict4ate awoxd, he
observed every movement of his kin&amp; nurse, and s~w the untiring eft'orts

~9$i18h1rkeflt, when the last envelop was removed, to discover the very
~udle~ of little- Ed~ly's play-tnings, which she h~ad hidden in the cave,
when fleeing from her burning 'home. "Wali-/ie-yal&amp; saw 'rale-face
at cave." Saying this, the savage drew close to Mary~ and;in
/    ~e he uttered, between his teeth~, a name that made the Mdr-
~no~-start, and a livid paleness overspread her cotanlenance. -It was
the name of Vorne, the murderer of her child-not the name we have
gwezvl~i~, but his real name, With a look of revenge and hate gla-
ring iti hi~ burning eyes,,  vbich seemed like those of the incarnate
demon of~vengeance, the warrior added, "Wah-he~yah Avow kim-pale
squaw nruch cry-.--rnaybe! ha! ha! ha.'-~maybc----ha! ha!" and with
these i;mintelligitle exclamations, he left the tent.
Mary wept long over her recovered treasures, novr the dearest object
she had in existence, 'tar they once belonged to her child. They were
he very play-things which she had s. often seen Lini play with, when
he wasa careless, happy child, and she a happy ~vife and mother. They
were all that was now left her of those happy days, and where is
the b~reaved mother who will no(enter into her feelings, as she gazed
upon these newly recovered relics? Yes! her husI and and child had
gone to a bloody grave, without the form of ~ trial, and that, too, in a
Republic that guarantees to evcry individual unlimited freedom of cor.~
science, and a fair trial by jury-a Republic upon whose flag i'~ embla~
zoned the Roman Eagle. Wherever the banner of Rhine played in
the breeze, t/u'~e the meanest citizen found protection. Paul, the Apostle
to. the Geatile'~ the preacher of a sect abhorred and accursed by the
multitude, found instant protection under the wings of that eagle.
When. he calmly, but proudly folded his arms upon his I reast, and said,
"I am a Roman citizen," th~ haughty Satrap trembled on his throne, for
well did he know, that if he dared violate the rights of the ILeanest,
niost criminal of her citizens, Rome, in the language of one of hcr
sons, "would hurl at his devoted head a lhunderloH." But does the
Am~rican Eagle thus protect the rights of the free-torn citizens of our
Repu~li~? A voice, from ra any a Mormon grave, from the Haze of
unnuinb~red dwellings, end from the victims of Lynch Law in nu-
merous other. forms, answers t'his question. It tells, trumpettongued,
the protection i~~hich our institutions afford to the unpopular citizen, who

-ea she ~was, and aij Mormoriess besides.
*       The door opened, and Mary's l4rother, who had met the man he. was
going to~e, entered. The ~pell in which all her faculties seemed
loun&amp;was instantly dissolved, and drawing a deep sigh, like one just
awakened from a hideous dream, she rushed from the room.
The command, "Love your enemies, do goo4~ to -them -that persecute
you," were no unmeaning words in the creed pf Mary Mayerick, -and
she earnestly endeavored to fulfill the precept, and feel for her remorse-
-less persecut~r5 the - spirit of -- Him whose dying prayer for his mur-
derers wasj- ",Fcdher, forgive them." - -
The trial of attending upon Vorne, which before, Mary, at times,
found lii~rdly endurable, was rendered doubly irksome by this declaration.
l3ut 0till, it was her duty to forgive, and render good for all the deadly
wrong-he h~d done her. -
She now carefully i~oided being in the presence of Vorne when her
brother was absent, and thus afford I him no opportunity of renewing
his revolting proposals. 1~ut she con. not always have the protecting

had trarispiied, he found her alone, -a I again made the ofrer of mar-

proposal, alledging no other season than her determination, -her mialter-
able determination, never again~ under any possible ~viscwnatancea, to

Greatly was he disappointed, for he had entertaine4 not a doubt of her

from the house aflbrded the latter an opportunity most ardently desired,
of conversing with the wido alone.
After a paus~ of a few minutes, during which the lVtormoues3 could
almost hear the beating of her own heart, Vorne introduced the sub-
ject ever present to his thoughts. He told his Jove, and told it in burn-
ing words. That he felt for the widow all the deep and absorbing emo-
tions of which his wild, impassioned nature was capable of feeling,
was no factions~ Her gentleness of soul, so unlike his own, her soft,
pensive, melancholy air, and her unceasing kindness to him during the
long days and nights when his life hung by a thread, had awakened in
his turbulent, impassioned bosom an affection for the Mormoness, which
he felt would be the ruling passion of his soul to the last hourof his
existence.
To this ardent profession, the Mormoness calmly, but firmly gave a
repulse. Not even yet believing her decision unalterable~ he spoke of
her unprotected condition after her brother should depart, and of the
wealth he had acquired by trade. As he proceeded, his voice rose wit1~
the increasing excitement of his mind. He at length averted to her
connection with the Mormons, and his generosity in proposing to unite
himself with one who belonged to a denomination so unpopular, so
horrid by the public. He would take her to a far distant State, where
her former connection with them would be forever unknown.
In the excitement of his feeli~igs, he had unwittingly confessed his
deadly hatred to a sect which he had proposed to join, and, 'unkrzowii
to himself, touched a cord that vibrated to the profoundest depths of her
heart, and.brought before her mind's eye, in all the vivid Jn~ies of truth,
the fatal scene when her agonizing prayer for the life of her child was
received with a fiendish scoff.
Even then, anxious to spare the murderer pain, she toLd him again that
her resolution was unalterable, and begged him to depart in peace.
Not satisfied with this, he still sought to shake her resolution. It was
not till then that the Mormoness, finding other means of no avail, told
him that there was an obstacle to her union with him-a barrier be-
tween them, wide and impassable as the gulf of fire that separated the
rii4 man in the Gospel from the bosom of Abraham-and again most
eaz'uestly implored and entreated him to depart in peace, without making
~iir~er solicitations or inquiries.
~ storm of passion arose in the bosom of Vorne, and broke forth
wildly and fearfully as the hurricane of the tropics; and he demanded.

rivited him to the spot, as if he were transformed into a marble statue~
and his eye-balls glared with intense horror. On the opposite wall of
the room, directly before him, he saw the Zion o~the Mormons. It was
noon-day. An armed mob, most of whom he instantly knew by name,
rushed along the principal street. Across the door-sill of a cottage lay a ~
man, weltering in blood. The scene changed. A youth, hardly twenty-
one years of age, in whom Vorne recognized himself, was dragging a
lad of noble bearing before the door where lay the dying man, the child's
father.t A. lovel female who stood by the side of the bloody corpse,
appeared to

the distant landscape on the east of Shawneetown, he had left that vU-

The exciting events of the past night had not been unfelt by the Mor-
moness. The death of her husband an4 child, with the sorrows through
which she had passed, were all presented before him, and she felt as if
she had been wading through that troubled sea for the second time.-.--.
