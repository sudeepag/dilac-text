THE INN. IN the latter part of the eighteenth century, in the ancient town of Plymouth, England, there was situated upon the north side of what was then called Pell street, and not far from the harbor, an old-fashioned inn. The upper story protruded over the lower to the distance of several feet, which feature, added to the leaning position of the whole building towards the street,- owing to the settling of the ground in front,--gave the house rather a threatening attitude to people pass- ing. Yet it was as firm as a rock, and thus it remained for many long years after. The main door opened upon a room which occupied nearly all the space of the ground floor. Upon a slightly elevated seat in this room, at the time of the commencement of our story, was a young female of great beauty, whose large eyes were so fascinating that when once seen, their expression was never afterwards forgotten. Around her in front, was a semi-circular counter, on which were several beer faucets, and on either side were three highly polished spirit casks. Around the many oaken tables that -were arranged over a lately sanded floor, sat customers who were happy in drinking and smoking, or admiring this pretty bar-maid. 2   10      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, On. the second floor, the parlor, sitting-room, dining- room, and kitchen were in close proximity to each other.  The parlor was tastefully arranged. A sofa was on the right, a fire grate at the left; a portrait of an elderly gentlemen, and one of a lady, hung on one side of the room, and two oil paintings of about the same size on the other. Plain, tasty curtains covered the two prin- cipal windows, and between these windows was sus- pended a mirror. A small oval stand, on which were the Bible and other sacred and devotional books, oc- cupied the center of the room, having at either end a plain arm-chair. The sitting-room had a table in the center, and com- mon chairs were placed appropriately around. A small' library occupied the side, and opposite, a shelf with to- bacco-box and pipes showed that some of the inmates enjoyed the weed. The dining-rooln was plain a:nd commodious, and throughout, all things were admirably arranged. Such was THE INN;- all the arrangements bespeaking ease and comfort to its occupants, if not luxury. Mr. George Pederson, its proprietor, might have been fifty years of age. He was of medium height and stoutly built. 'His complexion was light, eyes were dark and very expressive, his hair, once black, was very much sprinkled with gray, his brow was quite wrinkled, and other marks upon his once active person argued that time had begun to lay upon him its unfailing grasp, yet he was hale and strong. He had moved from London many years previous; and since the demise of his wife, the domestic affairs of his household had been conducted by his only daughter, Kate. Besides her his family had once included two sons; but one, George, had been adopted when an in-   OR THE DISINHERITED.      " fant, by a lady in London, and the other, Harry, had been lost at sea. At: the date of the commencement of our tale could be seen, from the windows of the inn, down Pell street, the harbor, with the ships-of-war, having upon their decks hundreds of men; their wall sides dotted with tiers of huge cannon; their tall masts towering far above the smooth surface of the water; with here and there a wind-bound merchant ship riding safely at anch- or, having sought that protection in port which the channel in boisterous weather would not afford; and many small vessels and boats plying to and fro, made the scene lively in the extreme. It was notorious that the best liquors in town were to be found at Pederson's, and many of all classes re. sorted there to partake of the social glass; but the greatest attraction of the inn was Kate, the lovely daughter of the inp-keeper. She was tall and elegant- ly proportioned. Her features were Grecian; her com- plexion dazzlingly fair. Her hair, which was of a dark auburn, was profuse, and hung in curls over her alabas- ter neck. But it was the expression of her dark blue eyes, with her fascinating smile, that caused one to for- get or irather overlook the beautiful turn of her features, the elegance of her manners, and the elasticity of her step. She had scarcely reached her seventeenth sum- mer, and, as might have been expected at that age, she was remarkably modest and unassuming. In consideration of the extraordinary manner in which beauty and purity had favored her, it is not astonishing that those of the opposite sex should admire her. Gen. tlemen's sons, in and out of town, often called ,at the inn to see her; officers of His Majesty's navy, although boasting the uniforms of lieutenants or midshipmen,   12       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, often walked the decks in the small hours of night, thinking of her bright eyes. Many a young man's heart beat lighter at her smile, and many a one gazed at her with love and admiration as he drank his wine or smoked his cigar, absorbed in pleasing thought. It was on a lovely evening in July. The sun had long since disappeared beneath the western horizon, and the shades of night had fallen upon the streets of Plym- outh.!Upon the hills and valleys, and upon the smooth surface of the harbor there was still a gleam of twi- light; but in the narrow streets, where tall buildings reared up to the height of several stories, it was dark. The lamps of the town were lighted. The eight o'clock gun had hurled forth its thunder, the roll of the drum had called on duty one set of guards, and sent another off. Two young men entered the inn, and seated them- selves at the far end of the room. They were dressed in plain suits of blue; but one side of a cap cover had accidentally become lifted from its place, thereby dis- covering a portion of a gilt band, and making it evident they were officers in the navy. "She is pretty, is she not, George?" said the oldest, who we may as well state here, was first lieutenant of the Race Horse frigate, then at anchor in the harbor. "She is, indeed!" returned the other, but then she's low born and ignorant; and as for virtue, poh! I am sure they are all alike, these bar-maids! She's here to draw custom." "And, judging from the appearance of this crowded room," said the lieutenant, "I think she has succeeded. But why do you speak against her? she appears quite ladylike, I'm sure. Her father is the proprietor here, and I think it is in her favor that she is industrious.'i   OR THE DISINHERITED.      1[8 The midshipman shrugged his shoulders and said, sneeringly, "She seems to me a confirmed coquette." "Hush!" cried the lieutenant, " here is the waiter! : What will you drink?" a Port." "And I a brandy straight, to the health of the pret- tiest girl in England." The last sentence, purposely spoken loud, reached the ears of the bar-maid; and although it did not ap- pear to offend, it did his companion, who exclaimed, "William! how can you so forget yourself as to speak in such a manner? See! how these low fellows stare at us! Do let us go! Why did we come to such a common place?" "Sir!" sharply answered the other, " remember we are in disguise. You said you wished a glass of extra port, here it comes. You said you wished to see a pretty girl, there she is. And even if we were not dis- guised, I know not what will injure us, for gentlemen of the highest respectability visit here; our commander called here yesterday; there are gentlemen at those tables yonder; and if this place is not good enough for the son of Lord North to drink in, I cannot help it." The midshipman, for such was the younger, made no reply. They drank in silence and departed; and as the lieutenant closed the door, he made a respectful bow to Kate, exclaiming to himself, "Beautiful girl! I will take another time to drink your health, and will colne alone." "That wine was delicious," said George, as they en- -tered the carriage which was in waiting for them. "And so was the brandy; and besides it was en- hanced in worth by being handed to me by the lovely bar-maid."   "      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Admitted. But why extol her so highly? Why call her the prettiest girl in England?" "Because she is so," answered the lieutenant. "Foh!" exclaimed the midshipman. You wrong others when you say so; there is your sister!" "1 My sister is a sweet girl, but that does not prevent my seeing beauty in others." ' Can it be possible," cried George, " that my friend has become enamored of that low born girl?" "Not so fast!" said the other. "I was only endeav- oring to explain the difference between the praises due to a sister and one who is not a blood relation; but you do not allow me, for the moment I begin, you interrupt me." "Well, go on, then," said the midshipman, " and I'll remain silent." "You belong to a high family, and so do I. You have a great prejudice against industry; against those who are poor; I have not. It is the industrious who roll on the wheel of fortunes-the industrious who stim- ulate virtue, honor, honesty, intelligence, health, wealth, prosperity, and other advantages to the human family; but it is the indolent that promote vice, dishonor, igno- rance, poverty, ill-health, and other evils. If I seek an honest man I will generally find him industrious, and if I seek a knave, I will generally find him among the idle. :If I seek a virtuous female, she will be found industri- ous, and those who are not virtuous are generally in- dolent You appear to be prejudiced against that pool girl because she is industrious; but for this, instead of giving her censure, I applaud her; and instead of being prejudiced against her, I am proud to say that I am biased in her favor."   OR THE DISINHERITED.      15 CHAPTER II. THE RETREAT. London, during the early part of the reign of George the Third, was not in many respects as it is now. It is true that Westminster, the Tower, the monuments, bridges, palaces, docks, spires, etc., then existed; the Thames' waters ebbed and flowed past her towering walls and roofs; and thousands of people thronged her streets as now. But the order of society; the safety of the public; the customs, habits, and fashions of the people, were very different. Hordes of banditti frequented her by-ways in disguise, and he who unwisely ventured into either of many of the n-arrow streets, having the appearance of wealth up- on his person, often put his life in jeopardy. Upon an eminence about a mile from the river, and half that distance below London bridge, was the entrance of a narrow lane, scarcely wider than three persons would require to pass abreast. It descended to a con- siderable distance, taking a circular direction to the left, then turning to the right, around a small side hill, and then to the left again, formed a somewhat imperfect let- ter S; and running on some distance further, was lost amidst several short alleys, that ran in different direc- tions, crossing each other at various angles. The height of many of the buildings on either side this lane, with the thick mist, fog, and smoke, that at most times envelop- ed London, caused it to be quite dark even by day, and of course still more so by night.   16 7-IEUTENANT COLBORN, In the most narrow, crooked, and dark part of the lane, and farthest from any public thoroughfare, were three time-worn, dilapidated houses, situated a little dis- tance from each other. They were all connected, how- ever, by subterranean passages, which besides ran to and fro, in different directions, and extended as far as the river, where they connected with the sewers, thus completing a communication between the houses and river. Spring trap-doors, nicely constructed at the turn of each passage through the floors, and between the ceilings, made many places of concealment so secure, that the police, with all their shrewdness and ingenuity, could not find a person hidden within these houses, or the dark recesses of their subterranean passages. Notwithstanding these houses had the external ap- pearance of ruin and poverty, yet they were richly fur- nished internally, and numerous articles of value were promiscuously distributed in different apartments; and jewelry, silver plate, and money were no strangers to their closets. Their proprietors were a band of outlaws who infested the country far and near; sometimes fre- quenting the city, town, and village; sometimes the for- ests, or the mountains; sometimes the sea; disguised variously as travelers, policemen, sailors, priests, or merchants. They accumulated much wealth; and al- though many had been brought to justice and hanged, yet they were so numerous, and had so many places of concealment, that they still existed, still plundered, and : still murdered. It had been hinted that -the police were watching the lane, as they were of opinion that outlaws had a retreat there; but in what part, or in which house, or houses, they did not know; and they dared not enter even its most respectable part, excepting in a very strong body.   OR THE DISINHERITED      ]17 It was on a pleasant evening in April, that, in a back room of the center and largest house, was seated upon a richly covered sofa, two men. Onie was tall and ro- bust; his face was covered with a black beard and moustache. 'His long hair, of the same color, brushed back from-his expansive forehead, gave him a look of intelligence; while his dark eye bespoke a more than common degree of cunning and wickedness. He was dressed in a black suit, and, with the exception of a small brace of pistols, concealed beneath the folds of his coat, was unarmed. He had precisely the appear- ance of a London gentleman; but his bearing betoken- ed one used to command. He was young, scarcely twenty-five; yet one would have judged him to have been older. He was the celebrated Fellows! chief of a gang of thieves, whose name had made many a trav- eler tremble, and by whose deeds many a one's pock- ets contained less of the precious metal. The other -was stout and scarcely of ordinary height; yet elastic and active, although many years the sen- ior of his companion. His face was closely shav- en, dark, rough, and wrinkled, as if it had been expos- ed to many hardships, and much dissipation. A pair of long boots were drawn over his nether limbs; and under his coat was concealed a dagger. He had dark, wicked eyes, like the other; and, taking him all in all, was as savage a wretch as had ever pulled a trigger, or cried "Stand " to a traveller. His name was Hubert; and a fit instrument to carry into effect any dark deed that his subtle commander might suggestswas-he. "How did you escape from that policeman?" demand- ed Fellows. "Took him under the ribs with this" (placing his    18       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, hand upon his dagger), " and dropped him into the riv- er." "' And what became of the package?" "I threw it into the sewer, and instantly followed it; while Fletcher pushed the boat from the shore, and was swept away by the current." "How came you in contact with the policeman?" asked the chief earnestly. "He came on me suddenly with a lantern, and be- fore I could escape he had me by the shoulder." "I regret this encounter very much," said Fellows, " for now you are open to recognition:" "He will never recognize me, or any other man, in this world," muttered Hubert, a and it's not my affair whom he recognizes in the next." "I hope we shall hear no more of this affair, then, for the lane is already suspected; the police force has been increased of late, and we must in future be more cau- tious." As he spoke he took a large repeater from his pocket, and looking at it, said it was time for him to start, as he had concluded to go into the country, and intended taking Fletcher with him. That person hav- ing been summoned, proved to be a young man of pre- possessing .appearance. He was. tall, and elegantly built; wore a long coat, girted tightly around his waist, displaying his fine figure to the best advantage. His complexion was light, and the beard had scarcely begun to grow on his chin; and his eyes bespoke so much can- dor, kindness, and good nature that none would have taken him to have been other than an honest man; and it seemed a pity that such a one had embraced the profession of a robber! yet so it was, for he was one of the followers of the outlaw, Fellows. Fellows observed to Hubert, that he hoped there   OR THE DISINHERITED.      19 would be no more trouble with the police during his absence, and stated that he should probably .return in a fortnighlt, and with his companion left the apartment. As the two reached the densely crowded street, and pushed their way through the throngs, none would have taken them to be other than they seemed, quiet and peaceable citizens. Turning a narrow street, they walked along to the distance of a mile, when turning to the right they stop- ped at the door of a house, situated a little back from the street,' and demanded admittance. "Let us step in, and see old Peg for a moment, " re- marked Fellows, " for as she is well posted upon many points of rascality going on in London, and particular- ly relating to the whereabouts of disguised policemen, it fnay be of service to us to see her." The door opened, and the well-known face of Fellows being a passport at all times, they were conducted into the house. An old woman, a wrinkled and forbidding hag, near- ly seventy years of age, appeared to be the Grand Sen- ora of the establishment. Her hair, matted and snarled in such a way that showed no comb or brush had troubled it for a long time, fell over her neck and face, thereby nearly concealing them from view. A bottle, containing spirits, upon the old table,- as if she had been indulging in her favorite drink; - a pack of cards upon the shelf; an old arm-chair, and three stools, were the only articles that were visible. ' "Well, my boy," said she to Fellows, " ye are quite a stranger! it's sometime since ye darkened my door last, and I began to think ye had deserted old Peg, and tak- en a younger spy! What's kept ye so long away? A wager, it's some young miss, ha I ha! ha!"   20       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "You do me wrong, aunty; I have been busy, tight- ly pushed, and sharply followed for some time, and have come to see you very particularly." "Ah i ha!" ejaculated the old woman, " that's what brings ye here, is it? Ye mind me well when ye are in trouble, but when ye're all right, a devil-a-bit do ye care for old Peg; but never mind, I've my finger on ye, so it's all right, my boy, ha! ha! "Come! come! aunty; no more of this; you know I do not wish to desert you, and as for a young girl, I would not snap my finger for any one." "Ha! boy! don't tell me that - but ye are youngo and it's all right." "Aunty, any news of the police?" "None! the boobies be all right, but one, who it seems has stepped out." "Stepped out?" asked Fellows, " what do you mean by stepping out?" "Stepped out, means that he's missed - no matter whether he's run away, or hanged himself." "Is that all, aunty?" "That's all." "How stands the lane?" The hag looked him full in the face, and said: "The lane has stood bad for a long time, ye know, and I don't think that time improves it any." "Any of the countrymen visited you lately?" "Ay!' but none ye know, or at least that I would have ye know." "TWho were they, aunty?" "Ye know, my boy, it's useless for ye to ask again, for I will not tell ye." Fellows, knowing it would be useless to ask again, and having gained as much inform- ation from her as possible, handed her a few pieces of   OR TIHE DISINHERITED.     21 gold, bade her good-night, and hurried from the house. "' There, Fletcher! that old woman is a remarkable person. She has kept a resort of that kind for many years; she has managed her cards so well as to evade- the laws, and several of the highwaymen have been ar- rested under her roof, yet, she has contrived to avoid suspicion; she has caused more than one prisoner of Newgate, sentenced to death, to be liberated; her spies are in all parts of London, and they watch particularly the police. She is rich, and can therefore do much in the way of procuring information; but mind you, we have to pay for it. Yes! I have paid her a great deal, and expect to pay her more, but if I get into trouble, she will assist me. She keeps a secret inviolable, and no amount of gold has ever made her disclose one." "I noticed," said Fletcher, " that she would not dis- close to you, who had visited hereof late." "She would not," replied Fellows, " and if she will not deceive them. she will not us. Now let us get our horses and be off to the country, and see what's new upon the road." They stopped at a stable, and having ordered their horses, they mounted, and rode leisurely up the street, --passed through the strand, crossed London bridge to Greenwich, where, loosing the reins of their noble steeds, they were soon far away from London. On the following day they put up at an inn, in a small village on the road, where they were joined by two others of their party, when having becwme, refreshed themselves, they continued on their journey, and took the road to- wards Windsor.   22       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER III. TH i HOME OF WILLIAM. Sir William Colborn, the father of the lieutenant, was descended from an aristocratic London family, and married a proud lady of Devonshire. His family was not large, comprising only one son and one daughter. Himself having entered the army at an early age, he passed through the usual military gradations, and, hav- ing been present in some of the most important battles fought at that time, he arose to the station of Major General in the army. William COolpborn, junior, had entered the navy as a midshipman, arid by careful attention, good behavior, a quick turn to penetrate nautical science, and aided by influential friends, had arisen at an early age to the first lieutenantcy of one of the finest frigates in the British navy, the Race Horse. His form was rather more than ordinary size; com- plexion light, yet bronzed by exposure; his features Grecian; hair dark, and falling in curls about his neck; eyes dark and brilliant; whiskers nicely trimmed, and moustaches lengthy. He was truly a noble-looking man, with an uncom- monly intelligent countenance, and there seemed to be something indescribable in his general appearance that made him pleasing to all. Melissa, his sister, was tall and well proportioned. Her features, like her brother's, 'wrere Grecian; her complexion dark; eyes black, and half veiled beneath   OR THE DISINHERITED.      23 their long lashes; her black hair fell in great profuskion about her swan-like neck and upon her shoulders. She moved with a firm and haughty step, which she inher- ited from her mother, who, besides being disagreeably haughty, boasted of having descended from one of the most aristocratic families in Devonshire. Sir William's residence was situated upon a lofty eminence, called Mount Prospect, about an hour's ride from the farther part of the west end of London, and but a short distance from the left bank of the Thames, and in the center of about twenty acres of highly cul- tivated and most beautifully arranged grounds. Upon the north, were arbors half hid among the shrubbery, and profusely covered with vines. Divided and appropriately arranged were many foot-paths, and' scattered among them were gardens and flower-beds. On the east, in front, was a green, sloping lawn, across which ran a serpentine carriage path to the' lodge, a small, romantic-looking building, having a plaster-of- paris statue of an ancient goddess on either side of the entrance, while numerous flowers, simply arranged, dec- orated its little yard. On the south were the kitchen gardens, near which were commodious stables, containing half-a-dozen thor- oughbred horses, and various apartments for other uses occupied the space of more than two acres of land. And on the west, was an extensive garden, containing various kinds of fruit trees &c. The mansion was large. On either side of the outer entrance stood a large bronzed statue encased in steel armor. One represented the celebrated Bruce, and the other his companion, Wallace. i A few rare plants were at their feet, andsthe whole was enclosed with a glass portico. A hall, with here and. there a statue, with   24       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, trophies of foreign countries placed between, having its walls decorated by ancient paintings, ran through the building's center and opened on a spacious piazza, the large and lofty pillars of which were entwined with fra- grant flowers. On the left was an immense drawing-room, taking up that entire part of the building. Three stands of costly mosaic stood equidistant through the length of the room; the side walls were ornamented with many of the best works of Vandyke, Rubens, and other emi- nent masters, and portraits of England's sovereigns for a century back hung at the ends. Curtains of the rich- est damask draped the windows, rich carpeting covered the floors, and each of the tall stained windows had a corresponding recess filled with mirrors, that reflected every object within their range. On the right were a parlor, library, and dining-room, that were furnished to compare with the great room on the left wing of the building. A study, many spacious chambers, and other rooms, were appropriately arranged on the second floor. A large but select party had assembled at the man- sion to celebrate the anniversary of Melissa'es birthday. Chandeliers and wax candles threw floods of light over the brilliantly furnished rooms, and, with the flash of jewels, the wave of feathers, the glitter of brocades, combined to make a scene of gorgeous magnificence. George North entered among the latest guests. He was a-young man of ordinary appearance. His figure was not tall, but was slender to a fault. His features were delicate; his complexion was fair; hair fair, and curling around his polished forehead; and his haughty blue eyes looked thoughtfully under their golden lashes. He could not be called fine looking, for he was too small   OR THE DISINHERITED.      25 in stature; but having a proud bearing, and being the son of a lord, he was much courted and flattered where- ever he moved, while others, far his superior in all things excepting birth, were passed by almost unnoticed. He looked upon all people not having a due portion of aris- tocratic blood flowing in their veins as inferiors; and although not yet twenty years of age, he treated others, even of advanced years, whom birth had not placed so high in society as himself, with a contempt and neglect often bordering on insult. In fact, his bearing in these particulars won for him the title of 'a "perfect gentle- man" from the imbecile critics of his class, and filled wise and just men with mingled hatred and disgust. Persons of his stamp are too often looked up to with sentiments bordering closely upon adoration, by many who are weak enough to admit that to support nobility, aristocracy, and all other principles of hereditary de- scent, is just, reasonable, and wise. Youncg North was a midshipman in the navy, not, however, from capability or any deserving merit, buthy that unfair rule by which birth, rank, and wealth fill the navy and army lists of England, too often with im- beciles, while men of ability and genius are excluded. He walked slowly through the gay crowd, bowing po- litely to all, and gracefully extended his hand to Melissa. She was -always beautiful, but upon this occasion seemed more than ordinarily so. She was attired in a plain pink silk, covered with white lace of gossamer lightness, a dress which contrasted well with her dark, luxuriant hair, and clear, sparkling eyes. Her curls were ornamented with a single rose-bud, and bracelets set with diamonds were the only ornaments she wore. ' Why has Mr. North made his appearance so late?" asked Melissa, casting upon him a modest look.   26       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Those confounded hounds led us into the forests, and by following on, before we caught the game it was half-past four," said he ; ' and our horses being fatigued, and we far away, were necessarily tardy." "Always ready with an answer," said Melissa, smiling - and at this instant her brother joined them, and she moved towards the ladies, leaving the young men in ^ earnest conversation. "Come with me," said- North, as he took the arm of the brother in his, " come; and I'll introduce you to one of the most exquisite little charmers you ever dreamt of; and when you see her, I think you can but say that she is the prettiest girl min England." They made their way slowly down the drawing-room, when North presented his friend to a young lady, and after a few questions and answers of an unimportant character, excused himself, and joined another party. , William being surrounded with several ladies of rank, a class he by no means either sought or liked, and wish- ing to get away, led the newly introduced to the dance, and when it was over, waited on her back to her seat, bowing with that grace and politeness known only to a polished gentleman, left her, and passed up the room. '"Is she not pretty?" asked George, hoping the aris- tocratic lady had made an impression upon what he called the low-bent mind of Melissa's brother. "She is," calmly answered William; " but there are others as pretty," and changed the subject. Time passed pleasantly on until night began to wane, then came the hour of departure. Carriage after car. riage rolled away, conveying the happy pleasure-seekers from Mount Prospect, until the rooms lately filled with gay guests were deserted. The candles flared and went out in their sockets, or were extinguished by servants, and all was silent.   OR THE DISINHERBITED#     27 CHAPTER IV.  THE ATTACK. As the Epsom stage-coach on the -downward trip, conveying two ladies, six gentlemen, and the mails, had reached that part of the country which was considera- bly covered with woods, the postillion suddenly reined in the horses and stopped. It was late on a dark and cloudy night in April, and as he had once been molest- ed by robbers in the forest which extended before him, he hesitated to enter it. "What's the matter, driver?" demanded a passenger on the front seat,- an old man who had not a pleasing countenance at any time, much less now that he had awakened from sleep in a very bad humor, wishing him- self he knew not where, but certainly not in a crowded coach, with no probability of reaching home or an inn for several hours. "What's the trouble, I say? Broke down? Any- thing ,vrong? "There's nothing broken," mildly answered the pos- tillion, " but as there have been robbers in this forest ahead, and this being the darkest night I have seen for many a month, I think it's best to return to the village we last left, and there tarry till morning." "Return to the village!" exclaimed the old man in a rage. "What the devil would we do there? there is no inn there! Robbers! What's the fellow talking about? I've heard much about robbers in my time,   28       LIEUTENANT COLBORN., but never yet have seen one! Don't be frightened at a shadow! Drive on'! drive on!" "A pretty fellow,", grumbled another, to carry the mails!" "Why," demanded another, " do you hesitate about it to-night any more than other nights?" "Because it's so dark; and if we should meet with robbers --" "Robbers!" interrupted the old man, " damme, there are no robbers! I have been from home a week, and must be back to-night, so drive on; and when you see a robber - -mind you, with your own eyes and not from hearsay--call on old Winslow, and he will take care of them!" "Robbers!" cried another with a sneer," I wonder what they are like? I should like to see one! Drive on! drive on!" -The postillion, muttering that perhaps the speaker might be gratified, touched the noble steeds with the whip, and the stage rolled into the dark mass of woods. "What's the reason," asked the old man, " that these drivers are so often telling about highwaymen? Now the idea of such a class of men being in this country is ridiculous." "Perhaps," answered another, "he wished to return to the village for some interested motive." "No," said a third, "-these fellows are so stupid and superstitious, that they imagine every object they see is either a ghost or a robber!" Crack, crack, sounded the whip, as the anxious pos- tillion urged forward the horses, to get through the for- est, when suddenly a shrill cry of " rein in your horses!" smote his ears, and the next instant the leaders fell back upon the wheel-horses, and the vehicle stopped.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      29 c' What's the matter now?" demanded the old man. "W e are attacked by robbers, as I suspected," an- swered the postillion, ,' so be prepared to defend your. selves!" "By heavenr!" cried the old man, " 'tis false! Drive on!  But confusion soon reigned within the coach, ladies shrieked, gentlemen held to the doors, and the next instant the muzzle of a large double-barreled pistol was thrust through the window on the side of the old man, and four dark lanterns, suddenly uncovered, threw their bright rays on the passengers, disclosing to them the stalwart forms of four men, firmly mounted and armed to the teeth. a By the piper of Howthe," howled the old man, "'tis true. Let me out of this." And he made an ef- fort to crowd away from that corner of the coach, as the contents of one of the pistol barrels passed over his shoulder; but he avoided these assailants only to en- counter at the opposite door a powerful man, who, seiz- ing him by the collar, pulled him out and hurled him headlong down a steep bank, into a deep mud-puddle. Several pistol shots were exchanged, and two passen- gers were killed and one wounded. Meanwhile, the old man climbed up the bank, and, with the fierceness of a demon, leveled his pistol at the breast of one of the outlaws, and pulled the trigger; but it missed fire, the powder having become wet by immer- sion in the water. The robber in turn leveled upon the, old man, saying, as he threw the full rays of his lantern into his face, "My powder is not wet, so be motionless and silent, or I'll pull upon you instantly." The highwaymen had the advantage. The passen- gers were compelled to submit, and they were soon   30       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, plundered of their watches, rings, money, and other valuables. Then the mails were robbed, and the high- waymen mounted their horses and disappeared, leaving the stage to proceed on its journey. Another kind of uproar ensued in the coach. The ladies thanked Providence for their escape, the wound- ed man complained bitterly of his pain, and the old man cursed the evil fortune that deprived him of the use of his pistol. "May they roast in sulphur," cried he, " for this! Here I am, robbed of my watch and chain, a valuable ring, and a purse containing more than two hundred pounds. Oh! that wretch who threw me in the water! May fiends torment him." The postillion, listening to these loud execrations, and thinking of the laughable position of the crabbed old man in the mud-pool, and of his own lucky escape, for he had lost nothing, changed his mood of sullen thought to a feeling of good humor, and recollecting how the passengers had insulted him, opened the little window through which he communicated with them, and good- naturedly said: "Sirs! you have now seen how those fellows look, and what they are like, and I believe Mr. Winslow has not taken care of them, as he agreed to." Early the following morning the stage rolled up to its accustomed stand, beneath the sign of the Epsom Inn. Numbers soon gathered around to learn what had happened. Lodgers and other inmates of the inn came running out, and others half dressed looked from the windows. The old man, covered with mud, with his hair standing nine-ways-for-Sunday, and clothing torn and minus his hat, in no enviable humor, ascended the-steps and entered the inn. The news of the robbery rapidly spread, and soon   OR THE DISINHERITED. the unfortunate passengers were surrounded by eager people, clamorous to know all about it. "You are fortunate in escaping with life," said a sym- pathizing citizen to the old man. "Fortunate!" cried he with a sneer. "I know not what you call good fortune I Here I am, robbed of-- look at me! Oh! the villain who threw me into that mud-puddle! And this is what you, sir, term being fortunate! Mon dieu!/" "I did not mean," mildly replied the citizen, " that you had been fortunate in having been robbed or thrown into a mud-puddle  " "Thrown into a mud-puddle!" shrieked the old man in an awful rage, stepping towards the stranger, who became frightened and ran out of the inn, leaving him raving like a maniac. The breakfast bell rang, and, as the travelers had fasted since the previous day, and were much in need of nourishment, after a hasty preparation, they were nothing loth to seat themselves at the table. At the sight and smell of beef-steak, mutton chops, hot rolls, coffee, et cetera, the old man became more com- posed, or at least civil. There were about twenty persons'at the table, and no other topic of conversation was introduced but that of the late occurrences. "It seems to me," said a gentleman in black, " that you ought to have beaten the villains off, as there were but four of them, and yourselves numbered seven, all, you say, well armed." "They shut us in the coach," observed one of the party, wishing to avert an insinuation that there had been some little cowardice displayed. "Shut you in the coach, did they!" articulated the   32       LIEUTENANT COLBORK, old man, casting upon the other a sarcastic look. c, You could have leaped from the window, but no, the driver and myself had to contend against them all." "It is a pity you could not have shot the wretch who threw you in the ditch," remarked a gentleman oppo- site, with a long black beard and moustache. "Oh! there is the pity!" joined old Winslow; " he took me by the throat, and before I had time to raise my pistol threw me down the bank! What an eye he had! I could tell it in a thousand." The two, gentlemen opposite could with difficulty re- frain from laughing; but with a great effort they retain- ed their composure. "The police should be immediately put upon their track," observed he in black, " and arrest them ere they escape to other parts." "Policemen," said the landlord, "are never where they should be when we are in trouble, and often pres- ent when we are not. I presume the robbers are far away ere this." He in black cast a meaning look to the long-bearded gentleman, but neither spoke farther, and soon the breakfast was over. On the morning after the robbery, several of the sympathizing inmates of the inn bade adieu to those of the unfortunate passengers still remaining there, and having cautioned them to guard against being too ven- turesome in traveling through parts of the country re- ported to be infested with highwaymen, entered the stage for Winchester. Let us go with them. "'Think they'll catch those robbers?" asked one of the passengers - a little man who had a costly brilliant on each of his little fingers. "I do not," answered he in black, " for they would be   OI THE DISINHERITED.      33 very unwise to reipmain in this part of the country and be taken. How far do you travel on this route?" "As far as Esk, a small village near Winchester." ; "And how far do you?" asked the little man in turn. "To Winchester; but it will be a long time ere I reach there, if all stages prove as slow as this." The old stage, with nearly worn-out horses, was in- deed a poor conveyance. The road was hilly and in very bad order, as late rains had settled the ground here and there, and in other places there were stones quite uncovered, making it really tedious in traveling.. Now one wheel fell suddenly into a hollow, bringing that side of the coach down with a jolt that made the old leather springs groan and creak, and throwing the inmates against each other, and as it rose again they were hurled back. Thus thrown from side to side the weary passengers kept up a conversation. "Why are these roads not kept in order?" asked one. "We pay enough to have good roads." 6 "And these horses," said another; " such miserable old nags I never saw. We shall want for food before we reach an inn, and my bones are already aching with this confouanded jolting." "This is decidedly the cap-sheaf of all traveling," observed another. "How far is it from here to the nearest inn?" asked he in black. "About nine miles," replied his next companion. "Oh, dear!" said one, "I think we had better return to Epsom." "We are far from Epsom," said the little man, "so ,4   we must go on." "It will be a treat to reach the next inn," said he in '":   black, "for I declare I am fatigued and hungry."   34      - LIEUTENANT COLBORN, a But 'tise said that that inn is haunted," observed one of the party, " and I would" rather be jolted from side to side in this miserable stage, and even upon such a road as this, for days, than to stop in a haunted house." "(Ha! ha! ha! you believe in ghosts, then," roared the little man. "Of course I do, and have seen many a one," replied the party addressed. "And so have I," said another. "And I! and I!" said others. "What are they like?" asked the little man, with a sneer. "I really should like to see one." "Oh! it's nonsense, gentlemen, to harbor such super- stition," said the man with the long beard, " for the days of such weak credulity are gone." "At last, then, we are here," said the little man," and I know not what others intend, but I am not to be jolted any more until I rest my bones." And taking his cane and overcoat, he got out of the stage. "Nor I," rejoined he in black, " for no fear of ghosts will induce me to let such a slow coach as this carry me farther." "Nor I," said the long-bearded man, "foralthough I've heard much of ghosts, and have told many a ghost story myself, yet never have I seen one." "Take our word for it," said the others, " that you will see one before you leave that inn." But further conversation was interruptedl by the de- parture of the vehicle. '"Now for a supper and good beds, and we'll be all right," said the little man, as he entered the inn and boldly registered his name at the office. Having finished the repast and taken a smoke, they were conducted to a room on the second floor, in which were three beds, and left to repose.   ,^   . , - s- U OR THE DISINHERITED.      85 Towards midnight, he in black was awakened by a strange sound; he called his companion, grasped his pistol, and, raising himself in bed, cried "Who's there?" Receiving no answer, he leaped to the floor to obtain a light, when the white forms of four apparitions, slowly descending from the ceiling, met his view; and as he thought of the warning given in the coach, he retreat- ed, trembling with fear, as far as the bed would admit, holding his pistol towards the specters. His companion, still on the bed, grasped also his pis- tol, but refused to use it or speak, although, as the specters approached nearer, as if with the intention of molesting, he drew a long breath, as if making a final effort to command his judgment, and saying in a deter- mined manner to his companion, ' be they ghosts, spir- its, or devils, pull on them!" the hammers of both pis- tols fell together. Flash! flash, again! the remaining charges exploded, followed by human cries, a heavy fall to the floor, the opening of a door and receding foot- steps, which proved that the. apparitions we r in reality /: human beings.             \ ;' .... A light showed two lifeless men, clad i loose white robes, and the little man, wounded, dress/d in the same manner, endeavoring to crawl from the riorn. "Appeared to the wrong men! walsd up the wrong party!" said the bearded man, with a smile. "I am not now surprised, sir, that you don't believe in ghosts, but I'll ease you of those brilliants." And as he spoke he took the diamond rings from his fingers, his watch and money from his pockets, and placed them carefully in his own. as    It had been the habit of the little villain, the keeper of that inn, thus to appear (accompanied with his house- hold), to his guests, while in-their beds, to frighten them   36       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, thence and from their rooms, and to steal their valua- bles; but in this instance their ghostly plans were de- cidedly a failure. They had made a sad mistake in re- gard to the appearance of these two strangers, for they had passed through too many fights, tricks, plots, sur- prises, and hair-breadth escapes, to be- so easily duped. Having the advantage now, they made the most of it, and proceeding from room to room, searched for money in all parts of the house; closets, drawers, trunks, and chests, they ransacked from cellar to garret. The old woman's room they were no ways delicate about, but searched everything, and succeeded in finding a large amount of money, jewelry, and other articles of value. They were in fine spirits all this time, as was quite- natural; and as the best of wines had quenched their thirst, they were very jovial, and made much sport of the little man, who sat on a chair moaning, partly on account of his wound, and partly for his great loss, for the greater part of the valuables he had stolen from others was about to be the spoil of more fortunate rob- bers, Messrs. Fellows and Fletcher. Having taken all they desired from the hoardings of the little man, they selected two fine horses from his stables, and saying to him, that, if their time were not so limited, they would give him a lesson in the science of robbery, sprang into the saddles, and making him a grand salaam, galloped off towards Winchester. "This is a noble animal, Fletcher," said Fellows. "By Jove, I can only with the greatest difficulty hold him." "And so is mine; how he carries his head! He re- minds me of that pacer I lost when pursued at the West End." : They are just what we require now," said Fellows.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      37 'b But the idea of that blunderer being a robber! Ha! ha! he's the last man I would have taken for such. And what a joke! Robber rob robber! I declare it's capital!" They traveled on until sunset, when coming up with a piece of woods, they sought its thickest seclusions, secured their horses to a tree, and laid down to re. pose. The wood was not extensive, but as the trees were close together, and many of them of small size, it made a good place of concealment. They, however, had no intention of committing any' more robberies in that vicinity, as they had already ob- talined many valuables, and wished to travel to the sea coast to join thmei1iessel-which had been cruising' among the Scilly Islands--to deposit their ill-gotten gains as soon as possible.   388      LIEUTENANT COLBORN9 CHAPTER VO -THE ARREST AND SENTENCE. Ere the sun had been four hours past the meridian, the highwaymen were again in their saddles, having been refreshed by a long sleep and a hearty luncheon. Their horses had been allowed at the same time to graze at the edge of the woods, and had drank from a spring of pure cold water. This would be a splendid place in which to pay our respects to some rich old cove(h! Fellows," said Fletcher. "It would, indeed!" ejaculated Fellows, " but the fact is, I don't wish another encounter just now, but would rather leave these parts as soon as 'possible, for travel- ers are on their guard, and besides, a police force no doubt will be sent to scour the region in quest of us." As they rode along, the full beams of the rising moon fell upon the adjoining pastures, rocks, hills, trees, and valleys, while thousands of crickets sang in solemn tones, reminding the riders of the days of their boyhood, when, good and innocent, they strayed through the garden of their pleasant homestead before bed-hour, or played in the streets of their native village.  While walking their horses, and indulging in convers- ation of days gone by, the sound of distant hoofs broke upon their experienced ears. Fletcher listened a mo- ment, then alighted and placed his ear to the ground. "Only one, Fellows," said he; " what say you, shall we stop him?"   OR THE DISINHERITED.      ; ("Well, it's mighty tempting; 'spose we do!" So saying, they placed themselves in an adjacent thicket, where they could easily spring upon the ap- proaching horseman, and examining their weapons, waited in silence. The sound of a trotting horse became more and more distinct, until in the moon's full rays the form of a sin- gle equestrian came into light. a lind, now," whispered Fellows, c'that you don't leap or fire till I tell you." "' All right," was the lagonic reply. The traveler came on all unconscious of danger, when, as he reached a point where the thicket was nearly abreast of him, they dashed 'like lightning upon him, and before he had ti! to collect his senses, one of them grasped the bridle of his horse with his left hand, and with his right pointed his murderous pistol to his breast, while the other thrust his weapon into his face. It was done so quickly, and so quietly, that the stranger had not time to collect his scattered senses, and feeling the cold muzzles of their pistols, and hear- ing the stern demand of Fellows, "Your money or your life!" he stammered, " 'Tis yours, but spare my life." "Your weapons first," cried Fellows. And taking from him his pistols, he bade him dismount. As he handed over his money, and was about passing out some other articles of less value, Fellows, recogniz- ing in him old Winslow, said, "Keep those, old man, for old acquaintance sake." "Theln you have met me before?" he exclaimed. a Where? -I would like to kn/ow."5 "On the road to Windsor!" was the laconic reply. "Robbed again, by the Apostle!" muttered the old man, " and by the same, Plains, too!" and carried away   u40      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, with passion, he suddenly seized Fletcher by the throat and exclaimed, "now I'll have my revenge." Fletcher extricated himself with some difficulty, and laughing heartily, said, ' You would not harm me, would you?" and turning to Fellows, said, "Our old friend is getting dangerous." The old man, finding how completely he was in their power, became more calm, and silently waited their do- termination. Fellows discharged the pistols he had taken from him into the air, and handed them back; and himself and companion mounting their horses, galloped away, leaving him to proceed on his way. It was late when they entered the ancient town of Winchester.  "We must put up here," said Fellows to his com- panion, "for ourselves and horses are in need of rest and nourishment." So they pulled up at the Western tavern, gave up their reins to the hostlers, and entered for the night. The late robberies in that part of the country, com- mitted in such quick succession, had become known far and near, notwithstanding the slow mode of conveying. intelligence in those days.  The police were instructed to use their greatest exer- tions to arrest the perpetrators, and the people generally were exerting themselves for the same purpose. No sooner had the travelers entered the house, than it was hinted they bore the appearance of being sus- picious characters, and the landlord gave notice to the police to that effect, and shortly after the chief of police and six of his men entered the tavern. "Where are the suspected persons?" he asked. "And what reason have you tink they are not hon- est men?"   OR THE DISINIERITED.      41 ' They have retired to bed," answered the landlord. "I did not like their general appearance, and Ithink that all men who have a suspicious look, in these times, ought to be examined, at least." "But," said a bystander to the landlord, " do you think it would be right for you to be arrested and thrown into prison, if you were traveling through a part of the country where you were not known, merely be- cause you looked like a cut-throat?" "Do you mean to insult me? and in my own house, too?" shouted the landlord, angrily. "I mean to insult no man," answered the'other, "but if I have any knowledge of human faoces, yours, sir, is more suspicious than those of the two travelers above. I'll lay a wager that they are honest men." '6The law is rather nice upon this point," said the chief of police, " which renders it doubtful if I can ar- rest them without some cause." "We are no longer safe;" returned the landlord, "since life and property are at the mercy of highway- men, and the people encourage, and the police wink at their atrocities." "I do not suppose that I am to ask your permission whether to arrest a person or not," said the chief of po- lice to the landlord, coolly. "You can do as you please, but I shall write to the magistrate upon this subject," was the reply. "You have already done so," said the policeman, "for you have written to mne, and I am that person= age."  "Ithink if any should be arrested here it ought to be the landlord, for insulting the magistrate, said some one in the crowd in a low voice. "And so do I,' joined another. 8*   42       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "We'll keep a good watch on the preomises through- out the night," said the magistrate, " and I'll call here in the morning and look into the matter; but surely we cannot in justice arrest peaceable travelers, merely be- cause they are strangers; we must have some slight semblance of proof against them, before we can arrest them." And, having left two of his men, more to keep the landlord quiet than to watch the travelers, he de- parted. "The magistrate is perfectly right," said the man who had disputed with the landlord. ' A pretty business it would be, to pounce upon a man because he happens to have a stranger face, and to treat him like a felon." "As for you," shouted the landlord angrily, "leave my house, for you have said quite enough." "And so I can, you thundering old grumbler! A fine tavern keeper, to turn upon his lodgers!"So sav- ing, the speaker departed. When the breakfast bell rang next morning, our travelers, who had noticed a policeman at the door (for the guilty mind always observes and suspects what the innocent pass by unnoticed), feared that something might be wrong, so appeared at the table in their over- coats, to conceal their arms. ' I don't like that fashion," whispered the landlord. "Why have theyput on their overcoats to breakfast in? It's not cold! I wish the magistrate were here." The repast being over, and the strangers' horses in -readiness, they demanded their bill. At this instant the magistrate entered, when the land- lord stated that the' two men had sat at the breakfast table, notwithstanding the morning was so warm, in overcoats, certainly a suspicious circumstance, and he would like to have their persons. searcled before they left his house.   'OR THE DISINHERITED.     43 When the magistrate moved towards them, as if to carry the suggestion into effect, they rushed out of doors, leaped'upon their horses, and were off before the aston- ished hostlers could be toldjto detain them; and cross- ing, over to the main street they turned, and were soon on- the country road. They galloped on for nearly two miles, when, looking behind them, they could see many horsemen in pursuit, but as they had so much the start of their pursuers, they hoped to make good their escape. But in a short time it was evident that the pursuers where gaining upon them, and it became doubtful whether they would be able to escape, and they urged their panting steeds as for dear life. Again and again their sharp spurs were drivenrinto the sides of their wearied horses, but it seemed useless, for their widened nostrils, their loud and hasty panting, and their bodies drenched in sweat, told too well that they could go no faster. "If we can but reach that wood," cried Fellows, " we might escape.;" and urging, spurring, and leaping their nearly falling horses, they reached its edge, and having entered a thick part, dismounted, climbed a large tree, and concealed themselves in its branches. On galloped their pursuers, and as more than a dozen horsemen passed under the very tree in which they were concealed, Fletcher whispered, "It's narrow work." "Yes, " said Fellows, "I'd rather be attacked by ghosts!" G' Here is a horse!" cried a policeman, " and I'm sure the rascals can't be far off." "There is a destiny hanging over us all," seriously observed Fellows, 'and the chances for escape are against us."   "       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, We have our weapons' still," said Fletcher mean- inglyO "That's true," returned his companion, "but they are of no use to us in this instance, for the more resistance we should make the more sure would be our destruc- tion." "Then do you intend to surrender, if they discover uS?" "I do-there is no other alternative. What could we do with scores of men against us? So look you for some place where we may conceal our valuables!" Fortunately there was a hollow in the tree, and they placed therein all the jewels, rings, money, and papers, as well as their pistols and ammunition, fearing if weap- ons were found upon their persons they might betray their real character, - all of which dropped many feet down into the trunk of the tree. "Now, then, Fletcher," said Fellows, " mark this tree, that we mav know it, for in its trunk are many thou- sands, and should we be so fortunate as to effect our escape - which is more than doubtful - we can return and recover the treasure." The search being kept up by their pursuers for some time without success, they began to ascend the trees, and examine them. "Fellows! we'll be taken," said Fletcher sorrowfully-. "Yes, we are lost! Destiny is against us, but keep your countenance, and don't turn pale!" The next instant a low cry, "Here they are!" told that they were discovered; but these experienced men were cool and calm, and when Fellows looked at his companion, his countenance had not changed. They descended to the ground, where many had as- sembled, among whom  were several policemen, when Fellows demanded whom they sought,   OR THE DISINHERITED.      45 You, as robbers!" replied a policeman, ' and we arrest you in the name of the King." On searching their persons, it is hardly necessary to say, nothing could be found to prove that they were other than they claimed to be, good citizens. The tree was also searched, but nothing could be found. "Why did you fly from the inn, like guilty, men?" asked a policeman. "Because you were about to arrest us," firmly an-. swered Fellows, "which you had no right to do, and our only chance was to fly, since you seemed determin- ed to find us guilty of some offense, whether or no! We were ready to pay our bills, and treated you all at the tavern with politeness. Then why have you treated us like felons?" These remarks, delivered by a gentleman of such pre- possessing exterior, who had taken his hat off, thereby disclosing his noble and intelligent looking brow, shook the opinion and belief of nearly every man present. "And furthermore," said he, "beware that you do not overstep the laws, and lay yourselves liable for heavy damages, by arresting innocent men." This staggered their opinion still more, and there arose a dispute among their captors upon the matter at once; but the policemen said they would take them be- fore the magistrate anyhow, and they set off with them for the town. Having reached the outskirts, great numbers of the citizens came out and joined the party, and even women gathered around, to get a sight of them. At first, the magistrate was convinced of their inno- cence, and was about to liberate them, when in rushed our old friend Winslow, shouting "E Hold!" and declar- ing he had been robbed lately, wished to see the prison-   "      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, ers. Immediately recognizing them, he cried, "Your honor! these' men are robbers! they have robbed me twice! and there are others in this county that have also been robbed by them." Upon hearing this, his honor committed them to pris- on to- await their trial, and, as the police led them out to convey them to a dark, damp cell, the old man said to Fletcher, "Oh, you wretch! you vagabond! I'll appear against you! Yes, I'll swear away your life, for it's now my turn! Do you remember the mud- puddle?" The day appointed for the trial arrived, and the court room was crowded to excess. Hundreds rushed to get a sight of the two who had committed so many daring robberies; for all acts of the kind that had been heard of far and near, were laid to their charge by the look- ers-on. Fellows gazed around the court with a careless air, and saw many he had seen before, and several--be- sides the old man - whom he had robbed. He showed no signs of guilt, however, and none, from his appear- ance, would have thought him guilty of the charges brought against him. Fletcher, less assured, cast his eyes to the floor, yet showed no signs of fear, and seemed to win a feeling of sympathy from the audience. The trial proceeded, and the evidence being so clear- ly against them - there being several present who bore witness to having seen them commit robbery and mur- der-as might be expected, they were brought in guilty. A death-like stillness reigned throughout the court, when the judge rose and in a solemn manner said: "The prisoners at the bar, after a fair and impartial trial, have been found guilty of highway robbery and   O TRE DISINERITED.  --     47 murder, thereby violating the just laws of God and man." Then turning to the prisoners, he asked if they knew of any reason why a sentence agreeable to the laws of their country should not be passed upon them. No an- swer being returned, he continued: "The sentence of the court is, that you both be taken from hence to prison, and there be securely confined until the first day'of September next, when you are to be led from thence to the place of execution, and there, between the hours of 9 and 12 A. M., be hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy on your souls." At the close of the fatal sentence, the eyes of Fel- lows fell to the floor, and he gave a deep-drawn sigh; but not a muscle was seen to move, nor the color to leave his face. Fletcher's fine features, on the contrary, were observ- ed to change; his lips became closely pressed together, and as the sentence escaped the judge's lips, the muscles of his mouth violently movdd, showing that some dread- ful thoughts were passing through his mind. They were then led back to prison, and the people soon dispersed, seeming fully satisfied with the sentence.   48      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CtIAPTER VI. THE BETROTHAL. In the little parlor in Plymouth, which I have before described, might be seen reclining upon the sofa, our beautiful heroine. She was dressed in a plain white cambric, with short sleeves and low neck, and wore a simple necklace of coral. Her bright blue eyes showed a more than ordinary degree of happiness, while almost unconsciously, a smile played around her sweet mouth. Her hair was carried up from her marble-like forehead. and fell in heavy curls back over her shoulders, lending an intellectual and proud grace to her beautifully shaped head. She held carelessly in her hand a fan, which ever and anon, she twirled over and between her taper- ing fingers, upon one of which was seen a plain garnet ring,-a cherished relic of her dear departed mother. But she was not alone. In an arm-chair at the window, sat William Golborn, in the undress uniform of a naval lieutenant. His every look showed that within, honor, virtue, good humor, and a good heart ruled pre-emi- nently.  His hair brushed back from his noble forehead displayed an intelligent look, while his eyes, as he gazed upon the lovely girl before him, expressed a degree of happiness, such as does not often fall to the lot of man. It was on a lovely Sabbath afternoon in July. The sun was shining in all his splendor. The church bells were summoning the people to worship. The colors of the shipping were waving and curling in the breeze, while   OR THE DISINHERITED.      49 a perfect stillness pervaded the town, as the well-dress- ed citizens, on their way to church, walked the streets in silence. "I hope I am not keeping Miss Pederson from church?" remarked William inquiringly. "Oh! no, sir, I attended church this morning, and that will suffice for to-day." "I am sorry to say," said he, " that I do not always improve the few opportunities I have of going to church which occur only when I am in port." ' Indeed!" said Kate thoughtfully, " how long shall you stay in port this time?" "About a month, I am happy to say, as we are fit- ting for Ca long cruise." The conversation continued, and as might have been expected, appeared quite formal, as they had never met to speak but once before, and although she had been often in the presence of gentlemen, and in such cases felt quite at ease, yet now in William's company, and alone, she seemed another person altogether. She could not appear like herself, but confusedly sat pondering her sentences. She knew not why his presence should cause a feeling in her breast that before she had been a stranger to; or should cause her heart to beat as if ready to burst its prison walls, and the rich blood to mount into her cheeks in crimson flushes, coming and going, like the hues in an opal. In brief, she knew not that it swas love. Oh! love! mysterious passion! enslaver of humanity! what art thou? In ancient times, even back to the crea- tion, when Eve our first mother was given to Adam, thou hadst existence, and hast followed her great fam-, ily even until now! Earth's mightiest-men have felt thy power.

Sovereigns, siates- men, and men of mighty talent have known the power- ful influence.. The Christian in holiness; the sinner in wickedness; the heathen in blindness; the poor in des- titution, - all have loved, and do still love! Thou hast done much harm, but certainly more good; hast caused much misery, yet more happiness; but whence thy ori- gin, or why thou art, I cannot explain, -any more than could the lovely Kate Pederson! William Colborn was not a man calculated to leep the most ordinaly person at a distance, by reserved manners; much less a beautiful girl, who already had won his heart! He had a frank and open disposition, and being naturally free from that detestable, and generally sure sign of mental weakness, - family pride, - was quite approach- able, and always talked as he meant, and consequently, Kate soon became   more at ease, and more like her graceful self, in his society. "Miss Pederson," said he, " in visiting you this second time, I have obeyed the dictates of my heart; and beg a thousand pardons, if it has proved an intrusion." "An intrusion! Oh no!" answered IKate, and blush. ng crimson, she cast her eyes to the floor, as she went on to say, "I am always happy to see those who favor me with their friendship." He gazed at her for a few moments in silence, hoping if possible to read in her eyes, that which might encour- age him to address her more fully; but nothing could he discover, for her eyes, riveted to the floor, were hid- den by their dark lashes; and her earnest countenance had suddenly assumed a  sedate air. He, however, ven.   OR THE DISINHERITED,      51 tured to draw his chair nearer to her, and taking her hand in his, asked with much feeling, if he could not hope that the time would come, when she would regard him with other and dearer feelings than those of friend- ship. Kate cast upon hinm a scrutinizing look, as if to read his inmost thoughts, and, as nothing could be seen in his countenance but truth, honor, and sincere love, she answered in a frank and truthful manner, that, as their acquaintance had been so limited, and the question put suddenly, it hardly became her to reply without some' thought,--and besides she feared there were weighty obstacles in the way of closer intimacy." "Obstacles! what obstacles!" said he, ( I am sure I know of none. - What are they, may I ask.?" Kate looked upon him with a' loving, yet modest glance, and answered : "The poor daughter of an inn- keeper, cIannot claim to rank with the son of a wealthy knight;" and as she spoke a sigh escaped her. "Is that the only obstacle?" he asked, " for if so I can easily overcome it." ' 1 know of no other," she replied, blushing deeply and covering her face with her fan. William drawing nearer gently removed it, and imprinted a kiss upon her rosy cheek, that sent the magic of love like sparks of electricity to her heart. William remained with her but a short time longer, as he was about to start that afternoon for Mount Pros- pect, but on taking leave he promised to return soon. He arrived home, and was joyfully received by his par- ents and sister. They were glad to do all in their pow- er to make him happy; and otler relations and friends endeavored to outvie each other in showing him kind attentions; for they knew he was- soon again to leave   52       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, them for a long voyage; and many months would ex- pire before his return, during which he would be ex- posed to the many hardships and dangers of the mighty deep. And besides, they had in view another object of no small consequence, which was to make a match be- tween him and some fair lady endowed with sufficient rank and wealth to enhance the position of the Colborn family. North had recommended Ida, while Melissa had an intimate friend, who being very pretty and lovely, she was sure would carry his heart by storm. But William passed by their chosen favorites with a carelessness and indifference that surprised them. He danced with them and waited on them, it is true, and passed among throngs of beautiful ladies of rank, acknowledging their charms, yet in his opinion, there were none so lovely and charm- ing as the gentle Kate. Melissa declared that he had a heart of stone, not to make a choice when he had such a selection of young ladies who were all in love with him. The following letter, written at an odd hour during these gay festivities, will perhaps afford a solution to the cause of this indifference: "ONDON, July 11, 17- DEAR KATE :-I have taken the liberty to address you by this endearing appellation, and hope it will be ac- cepted, as a token of my esteem, friendship, and love. It is true, our acquaintance has but just commenced, but I hope it may be prolonged for life. I have now been home several days, and my friends seem to vie with each other in making fetes and parties for my pleasure. But among all this gay life, among all the fine ladies into whose company I amthrown, there are none so pleasing to me, may I say it--as one who is far away in Plymouth. But to be more explicit. The   OR THE DISINHERITED. feeble attempts of my pen will hardly portray the fond love you have inspired in my breast. My highest hope is to have this love reciprocated; my highest happiness would be to be able truly to call you my own. But I am constantly haunted by anxiety. Perhaps some other more fortunate person has won your young heart's affections, some other whom you doat upon! Heaven grant that such is not the case; that I am not to be made miserable by the receipt of such intelligence. But I will driv/such cruel thoughts frim my brain. I visitd lthe Iuseum yesterday, and as I wandered alone% rough those vast halls, looking now upon one specimen of man's wonderful genius, and now upon another, my mind wandered away to Plymouth, and I wished you could have occupied a place by my side. I attended a ball in the evening, but amidst all that was gay and lovely, I was not happy. I was carried in imag- ination where I hope to be soon in reality-and to hear from your lips my fate. Till then, believe me Sincerely yours, WILLIAM COLBORN. Kate was seated in the bar room, when the post-man entered and presented her this letter. As she looked at the superscription, and the stamp, which told plainly who had sent it, she turned ashy pale, and unmindful of the banter of an acquaintance present, excused herself- and sought her room. Here, for a while, she sat musing. "I suspected before," she murmured to herself, " that he, being of so high a family, could not be sincere and honorable, and now I am almost sure of it. But at all events, I'll read the letter, and if it is not wholly respect- ful, will return it to him." Thus musing, she broke the seal, and with a scornful look, began to read. But be- fore half its contents had been perused, her eyes lost   54       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, entirely the look of doubt and displeasure, and as she finished, her face became suffused with pleasant smiles, and pressing the letter to her lips, she exclaimed "Never will I doubt him more." Having re-read those, now to her, precious lines, she placed them in her bosom, and descended to'the bar room with far different and happier feelings than when she left it. Meanwhile William being anxious to return to Ply- mouth, took an affectionate leave of all at Mount Pros- pect, and started on his journey. It was evening when he arrived, and with a light heart he hurried to the inn. Kate received him with modest kindness, and accompa- nied him to the parlor, where he took a seat by her side. He declared that he was truly happy in being with her again. She acknowledged the compliment with a slight bow, and smilingly remarked that she also rejoiced that he had returned safely. "And are you really pleased at my return?" said he, hoping to draw from her an acknowledgment of love in return. "I am," she modestly replied. "Did you receive my letter?" ' I did, and have to thank you for your kindness." "How did you like its contents?" She hesitated a moment, anxious to find an answer that would not appear too bold, then said "I like the contents well, provided the meaning they express is sin- cere and honest." "' Do you doubt my sincerity and honesty, then?" said he seriously. She cast her piercing eyes upon him, as if determined to read-his most secret thoughts, and having detected nothing upon his noble features but the frank, open, and   OR THE DISINHERITED.      55 well meaning looks of an honest man, replied that she did not. William gazed in deep thought for a few moments. upon her lovely face, then he took her trembling hand within his own, and said in a low voice, but with much feeling, "s Kate, I love you-devotedly love you. Will you be mine?" Her head drooped upon his shoulder, and she trem- bled violently, as she uttered the wished for monosylla- ble. He threw his arms around her sylph-like form, stamped a long and lingering kiss upon her ruby lips, that sealed for life that sacred compact. "Now indeed am I happy," he cried. "But have you weighed the obstacles I have spoken to you about?" asked Kate. "I have, but know not why my happiness should be sacrificed, to gratify the foolish pride of my family." "Do your parents know of your partiality for me?" "They do not, but shall in due time." "And do you not think they will oppose your choice?" a' I am sure they will, and have made up my mind accordingly." a I should be very unwilling to be the cause of unhap- piness to your parents," she said. "I know not how the fault can attach to you, dear  Kate;" was his reply, " the fault, if any, lies with me. And even if you were at fault, would you wish to make me wretched in order to make my parents happy?" "I do not wish to make you wretched," she replied, "nor make your parents miserable, either." "I hope dear Kate does not regret her promise." Kate looked into his face, and bursting into tears, ex- claimed emphatically, "Never. I promised my hand where I truly gave my heart, and no circumstances   56       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, shall cause me to retract. Yet I am well aware that your parents will be angry when they learn that their son has, in their estimation, thrown himself away." 'And she sobbed aloud. This was too much for William to witness without feel- ing deeply affected, and raising his voice to a higher pitch, he exclaimed 1"Dearest Kate, why I should love so noble a girl as yourself, is certainly not strange; for you to return my love is natural, and as I believe a man to be a better judge himself, of what constitutes his own happiness, than others are, I swear before high Heaven to remain true to my choice, true to her I love-although I may receive the curses of my family, and finally be dis- inherited." As Kate heard him take this solemn oath, she shud- dered to think of the many troubles he was likely to endure for her, and she essayed to speak her gratitude, but her feelings checked her utterance. William, completely overcome to see the one he loved so wretched, tried to cheer her by picturing a bright future, where they would be all to each other that loving hearts could wish. After spending a few happy hours, such as are known only to one whose first and ardent love has been re- turned, he folded her to his fond and beating heart, bade her an affectionate good night, and hastened to seek that repose of which he stood so much in need, after the longand tedious journey of the day.   57 OR THE DISINHERITED. CHAPTER VII. THE MUTINEER'S BRIDE. The thread of our veritable history now takes us to the far-off islands of the Pacific. The mutiny of the Bounty, that took place, April 28th,- 1789, has been fully described by historians. One whose fortunes are to be commented on, was a partici- pator in that bold, piratical act. Christian, Hawood, Stewart, Young, Baskett, and others, having taken the Bounty from Captain Bligh, arrived with her at Otaheite. Hundreds of well-known *faces crowded to the shore, to welcome them back, among whom were anxious wives and sweethearts; and all rejoiced that the white man had come again. One of these white men, who was simply known as Har- ry, hurried through the crowd of rejoicing Kanakas, until lost in the foliagce of bacana and plantain trees. He soon reached a hut, and rushing through its door- way, was clasped in the arms of his loving wife, Wife! yes, wife, - not, however, by the laws, forms, and cus- toms of civilized society, where marriage is too often a matter of business and speculation; where the young are often mercilessly sacrificed, to gratify family pride, or the love of rank and wealth; the curse of humanity, which often forces away hands unaccompanied byhearts; thereby blighlting many bright expectations, and caus- ing often an after life of unhappiness; but by that great law of nature, which at that time obtained amougJ the , / -   4  ,   58      LIEUTENANT COLBORN,  simple islanders, - disinterested and unbiased desire of human hearts. No clergyman, with grave formalities, had joined their hands; their sacred word of honor, which had been given, was sufficient in uncivilized Ota- heite. It is singular, but nevertheless too true, that the great- er the extent civilization has reached among any people, the greater and more numerous are their vices, and to find a people comparatively free from vice, we are obliged to look amon the uncivilized nations. The men of Otaheite are tall and well shaped. They bear themselves nobly with their head and broad should- ers thrown back, and the chest expanded; and, with the exception of a few braided and matted plantain leaves, tied closely around their waists, descending to the knees, go naked. They manage their canoes with admirable dexterity; are expert swimmers; and in their way, great warriors. The women are handsomely formed, and pleasing in appearance, though, like most of the aboriginal inhabitants of tropical climes, they are of dark complexion, or what is ordinarily termed copper color., Their costume consists simply of plain tappa, falstened closely around their bodies just below the arms. The government of the islanders is vested in a king and numerous chiefs, to whom they are in a state of - complete submission. This appears to be the only mzan- ner in which uncivilized nations are gove'nZed, for to the ignorant and dependent, the titles king and chiefs, or mnajesty and nobility; have an all potent charm. The youthful Toono, Harry's wife, was but a child in years, having seen but thirteen summers; but in that sunny clime maturity is early attained, and she was ful- ly developed inito womanhood.   OB THE DISINHERITED.       59 She was tall, above the usual height, and perfectly formed. Her eyes were black as night, yet mild and loving, and she bore herself as if she were a princess in the land, ailand so she was. Her long black hair fell in great profusion to her waist; and a thin, pliable, white tappa, tightened closely around her shoulders, fell i numerous fleecy folds to her small feet, covering her person sufficiently to abide the laws of modesty, but indicating her perfect shape. No life consuming cor- sets compressed her chest, no weighty skirts and cring lines caricatured her proportions, but all woman, and without deception, she stood proud of herself, as God had made her!  No palace reared its lofty walls for her reception, but a plain round hut of grass sheltered her from theoiun; mats answered for seats and couches; and in that mild clime she required no covering. She was the daughter of a prince, and from his home the Englishman had taken her for his wife. After a mutual embrace, leaning on his arm, Toono asked about the mutiny; and, as he related the affair, she cast upon him a look of love, and declared he should never go from her again. "I have no wish to do so, my dear Toono, and did not wish to go from you before, as you well know, but was forced on board the ship, and away from you." "I know you were," she said, and entwined her arms affectionately round him. He cast a look of admiration upon her, and said, "' My dearest Toono, never will I cease to love you, and nev- er will I return again to England."  . ("Let us go, dear H-arry," said she, "to that beauti- ful spot, the island of Eimeo, where the wood dove from the forest is never tired of telling his tale of love;   60       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, let us stroll through the sweet oraDge groves, sit upon the rocks, and look down into the blue waters of the ocean; let us plunge into its foaming surf, and swim like fish through its curling billows; then dive down to the clear white sand, and gather beautiful shells upon the bottom." She led him through a narrow path to the sea shore, and stepping into her canoe, she bade him do the same. On, on they sped, splashing the briny waters with their paddles; on, on, through little channels, until they reached the open bosom of the serene Pacific, that wash- ed so gently the shores of beautiful Eimeo. They step- ped from the canoe, and rambling up the hill, seated themselves upon a grassy knoll, and gazed out upon the far blue waters. The rolling seas swept in from the wide ocean, and broke upon the beach in curling breakers, and all around was grandeur and beauty. For several hours they re- mained on the islet, rambling from place to place, and enjoying its pleasures; and in the evening returned to Otaheite, and their home, where, having partaken of their simple repast, free from the cares of the morrow, free from the cares of money, free from the cares of business, free from all cares incidental to civilized life, they sunk to sleep in each other's arms. Early on the following day a cry of "Sail, ho!" was heard, and soon hundreds were gathered upon the shores of the harbor to see her. "A Spanish brig!" said Stewart. "I think not," earnestly remarked Christian, " for she appears very like an English vessel, so we had better conceal ourselves." She tacked several times, and neared the shore, and proved to be a Spanish vessel that had called for sup- plies.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      61i She clewed up her sails, anchored, lowered her boat, and soon her commander landed. Englishmen, Spaniards, and Kanalkas soon joined in friendly conversation, glad to meet each other. The islanders invited the strangers to their huts, and placed before them their choicest food. Thus weeks' were spent, but at length having recruited, the Spaniards prepared to go. The wind blew fair; the crew were on board; the topsails were set; the anchor aspeak. But where is Toono? She could not be found! A general search began; and Harry rushing to and fro, implored his countrymen, as they loved their wives, to assist him in finding his. "I fear," cried he, " that she is on board the brig! she has been stolen by those treacherous Spaniards! Can it be possible that men can be so ungrateful? but there is no time for parley; the brig is under way! Oh, she's lost to me forever!" "Rescue my daughter!" cried the prince, her father, and the next instant, the war-cry rang through the for- ests! Soon a hundred canoes launched out upon the waters, and a thousand paddles swung by sinewy arms, urged them forward. They turned the point, and gained upon the receding brig; but the wind increased, and the vess6l crowded on sail,- and the heart of Harry sank within him, for he saw that the chase was useless. ' Spare your strength, good friends," said he, " your exertions are useless. The accursed Spaniards, who sat at my board, ate my fruits, drank my wines, and slept under my roof, have stolen away my dear Toono! and then he sank down to the bottom of the canoe, and seemed paralyzed with anguish. "We may as well return," said Torquil, and he thanked his stars that his Neuna had not been stolen, Curses and threats were uttered by the Englishman   962      LIEUTENANT COLBORT, against the brig, her crew, and all the Spanish nation; and a general petition went up from the Kanakas to their gods, imploring the return of Toona, and the de- struction of the brig and the treacherous Spaniards. With heavy hearts the islanders slowly paddled their canoes back towards the shore, and as it became dis- tinctly visible, and they saw their countrymen upon the beach, they felt still more the pain of returning to them without the fair bride of Harry. Approaching the shore, thus sadly, a sound of many voices struck upon their ears. What could it mean? They leaped upon the beach, and ascended the hill; when lo! could it be true? Toono in all her loveliness stood before them. She sprang towards Harry, and the next instant they were locked in each other's arms. Where have you been?" he asked in astonishment, "We thought you had been stolen." "I hid myvself, dear Harry, to test your love for me; and now I  find it so well sustains the trial, I will never again try the experiment; but live only for love and you." And as the congratulating shouts of hundreds of their friends reout the airu the-lovers returned to their cabin.   Ol THE DISINHERITED.      63 CtAPTER    VIII. TIIS FRIGATE'S DEPARTURE. Kate sat like a statue at the parlor window, gazing at the Eace Horse frigate at anchor in the harbor. Her elbow rested upon the window-sill, her chin upon her hand, and her eyes half closed told plainly that something weighed heavily upon her mind. She was aroused by the pressure of a hand upon her shoulder, and looking around, William stood beside her. No cheerful smile played upon his usually pleasant features, all there was sad; he had called to say farewell! As Kate looked on his sad countenance, she could hardly restrain her tears. Have you come to bid me adieu?" she asked, "your looks betray your unwelcome m1is- sion." ' I have," he sadly answered. "The frigate sails at once, and I must go immediately on board." "  Oh, "William!" she cried in despair, -' it would have been better had we never met , for I foresee nothing but trouble in store for us! You will be gone for years; and when you return, there will be bitter opposition to - our union on the part of your family." '.' Does my dear Kate really wish we had never met?" asked he, seriously. a I do not," she answered, "but merely say that I foresee .much trouble." "We must meet it boldly," said he, " and not be fainthearted, and I do not doubt that we vill yet be hap-   "      LIEUTENIANT COLBORN, py. May I ask that during my absence you will still continue to believe me sincere?" "Why should I doubt your sincerity?" "Because I think your father does, for he seldom speaks to me; and when I enter he always leaves the room. Is it not so, dear Kate?" "I have observed it," she reluctantly answered, " but I did not wish to bring up any objection in that quar- ter, as there are certainly others so much more wreighty as to nearly break my heart." "What is his objection to me?" asked William. "He seems to think you are not sincere; and that your family will never consent to our union.1" "And does my love think as her father does?" I do not as concerns your sincerity," she answered hastily, " but most certainly I do coincide with him, as to what will be the sentiments of your family."' "Am I to understand by this," he asked, " that you regret that I am not of the same class in society with yourself?" "I do, most sincerely,'" she answered, " for then I should be happy." William, elevating himself to his full height, and plac- ing his hand upon his heart, nobly exclaimed, "Then, dear Kate, consider me so; consider me no longer the son of an aristocrat, for I can assure you that I am deter- mined that no family pride shall interfere with my mar- riage selection." "And imust you go?" she asked,- clinging to him and holding him back; but he, gazing upon her intently, as if to daguerreotype her expression upon his mind, clasp- ed her-to his heart, pressed his lips to hers, and rushed from the apartment. The Race Horse was ready for sea, and her officers   OR THE DISINHERITED. and crew on board. She had been thoroughly repaired, and fitted for a long voyage. THer top-gallant masts o were il end, and yards across and all things being on board showed she   as to sail immediately. She was one of the finest frigates in the English navy; and as she lay with her long yards extending far beyond her sides, as if brooding over the still water, she appeared truly n  ajestic . The ponderous capstan, manned above and below, wound1in the cable; the sheets of the expansive sails were hauled home; hasty orders given through the trumpet, and the shrill tones of the boatswtain's whistle, told that the ship was under way; and soon, under a cloud of canvas, she was moving gracefully over the surface of the harbor. Lieutenant Colborn raised a glass to his eye, and fixing it on a window of the inn, gazed steadfastly at the form of the lovely Kate, as h she sat there watching the rleceding ship that was bearing away the object of her young heart's first and dearest affections, and a sigh escaped him as the power of his glass magnified her form sufficiently to be distinctly recognized. Presently he dropped the glass, and turned to meet his friend George North, who just at that moment ap- proached. "What's the matter?" asked North, and whom do you mourn after?" ,My betrothed wife," candidly answered Colborn, "the dearest object to me on earth." North was thunderstruck ;' and recollecting what had transpired between them at the inn, and having no doubt that he alluded to the bar-maid, exclaimed, "Is it pos- sible that you are betrothed to a lady at Plymouth?" *        In 4 *    I-u I TN AISNT COLBOIRN "Why not?" returned William, "I am proud to say that I am engaged to a lady whom I love dearly."  "May I make so bold as to inquire her name?" ' ate Pederson!'" independently answered the first lieutenant. The midshipman cast upon him a look of regret, and in deep thought he walked away. The ffigate soon began to rise and fall with the heavy swell of the, sea, as she had passed from the harbor. Ere long the time for the pilot to leave arrived. Thie royals and top-gallant sails were quickly clewed up, main yard swung aback, head sheets lifted, and the helm put slightly a lee, and the frigate soon nearly lost her headway. The pilot descended the ladder, stepped in- to the boat carefully bearing a note that conttlincd within its precious folds a lock of hair, and on the en- velope might have been seen the superscription of Miss Kagtharine Pelerson,. He le ft; the head sheets were hauled aft, after yards pointed to the wind, mizzen brailed up, the helm put up, and off tswung the bows of the frigate.  In a  few minutes all her square sails were opened to the breeze; then the studding-sails were set, and as ;hese far extended, bellying wings came in contact with ;he freshening north-east breeze, the good ship leaped ,way, as if proud to be free upon the ocean once more nd stooping now and then to kiss the foaming billows hat splashed against her bows, she soon left the shores f  old England so far behind that no part of them could )nger be perceived. Night came on, the watches were set, and many of ie four hundred men on board cursed the fate that ,parated them from wives: and sweethearts,  bat none ore heartily than did the second in command of that Dating world, Lieutenant Colborn.   'What is nmore noble-looking than a ship under full sail at sea; her hull modeled so as to ensure both safety and speed; built of the strongest aind most durable wood, bolted and trunneled through 'and 'through, beamed, hooked, stanchioned, and fastened so perfectly and secure, that she is capable of withstanding the vio- lence of the heaviest gales, or the tremendous force of a battery! - her spars, towering high in air, support- ed securely by rigging, and crossed by yards of appro- priate size' and length, in their turn supported by lifts and braces - while internally, her immense capacity, divided and commodiously arranged by decks and apartments, serves thp purpose of conveying valuable cargoes, if a merchantman; or stores, water, and all the munitions of war, if a man-of-war I   68       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER    IX. THE HURRICANE The Race Horse bounded on until reaching the en- trance of the Bay of Biscay, when clouds of stratus, that had been passing from the northeast, began to as- sume the form of nimnbus; the sea-birds soaring high, and other symptoms - knowh only to seamen - of the approach of boisterous weather, caused a shrill piping fore and aft the decks of, "All hands, ahoy! shorten ail!"S The studding sails, and all light sails, were quickly doused. The breeze increased. " lCan well the weath- er braces, reef tackles and buntlines! Lay aloft, top- men, and stand by to double reef!" shouted thefirst lieutenant through his trumpet. Clatter, clatter, flew the topsail halliards. 6 Belay! belay!" was then the command, and soon the topsail yards, fore, main, and mizzen, were crowded with active sailors, gathering in folds of heavy canvas. "Lay down! lay down! belay! belay!" were piped in: quick succession. "Strike the royal and topgallant yards, and house the masts!" was the next order. The yards were soon on deck, the masts lowered as far as the topsail yards and lashed, and all hauled taut, and the watch piped below. The wind increased to a gale, and by four bells, in the first watch} all hands were again piped to shorten sail.   '1 69 OR THE DISINIIERITED. P  "Take in and furl the topsails, reef the courses!" was the order, and soon the noble frigate was snug. The gale still increased, the lightnings flashed, and the clouds with great rapidity passed to the leeward. "Furl the fore course!" was now. the order. M"an the gear! Are vou all ready?-start away!"  And soon that heavy sail, so lately filled with wind, by gear and men, was smothered to'the yard and furled. "She's now snug, sir," said the captain to the first lieutenant, " so pipe below." "Aye! aye! sir!" answered Colborn, and passed the order to a junior officer. "We have a good crew this time, sir," observed the first lieutenant. "Yes, sir," responded the captain, " for we had a good selection." And having made a few remnarks concern- ing the weather, he descended to his cabin. The gale soon became one of the most terrific that liad troubled the Bay of Biscay for many years. The sea ran two ways, one from the southeast, the other from the south-southwest, tumnbling together as they met, and forming into mountains, while here and there a pyramid rose so high as to threaten to fall upon the ship and swamp her. Ni-ght deepened, a fearful night indeed. Now a tre- mendous sea rushed upon her, as if to take some terri- ble revenge, but she arose forward like a rearing horse, and as the towering billow, about to break upon her decks, rushed on, she rolled and lurched so far to lee- ward th ththe main deck rail and lower yard arms were buried in the water, thus nobly exposing-her broad wall side to resist the dreadful force of the wave, as if in or- der to preserve her decks. The sea passed; she right- ed quickly, while tons of water escaped from open ports   70       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, and scuppers, and she was again ready to parryoff in her artful manner the next wave that the terrific gale should force upon her. Eight bells struck, and summoned North on deck. The snarling of that terrible south-easter sounded dole- fully in his ears, as, muffled to the eyes, and booted to the knees, he ascended. to the deck. The captain now appeared on deck, and observed that, as it had come on rainy, he fearted there would be a shift of wind. "In that case," said the first lieutenant, " we would be liable to be taken aback." "Mr. Colborn," said the captain, "all hands wear ship!5 "Mr. Black," said Colborn to the lieutenant of the watch, " all hands wear ship!" "Mr. North," shouted Black through his trumpet, "order the boatswain's mate to pipe all hands to wear ship!" "Boatswain's mate!'! howled out the diminutive North--who was so muffled up in pilot cloth that he might have been taken for an Esquimaux -" all hands, wear ship.!" "Aye! aye! sir!--whew! wheww! All hands, 'wear ship! Tumble up, tumble up!"1 "Are you all ready?" shouted the first lieutenant. "Aye! aye! sir! all ready." "Hoist away the fore topmast staysail! port the helm! square the after yards!" "She does not go off," said the captain. "Send forty men into the weather fore rigging!" This seamanlike mnanocuver being promptly obeyed, the frigate fell off, and as a heavy sea took her on the beam, she rolled most frightfully, and away she flew be- fore the gale.   71 OR THE DISINHERITED.  "Light, ho!" shouted a midshipman on the fore-' castle. "Sail ho!" cried a forecastleman, as the lightning's flash enabled him for an instant to see the dark mass of spars and rigging of a vessel looming above the sea under the bow of the Race Horse. "Where away?" cried the first lieutenant; but be- fore an answer'could be given, the frigate plunged over the reported vessel. Three concussions were distinctly felt, shrieks of human voices, and all Aas over, for the unknown vessel with all on board had gone down to rise no more. The Race Horse came to on the starboard tack, and lay heading on the sea as if nothing unusual had hap- pened. "Sound the pumps," said the captain, and it having been done, " no water" was reported. "An unfortunate vessel that," observed the second lieutenant. i"Yes," said Colborn seriously, and we can thank our stars that our ship did nct meet the same fate by the collision." "Some poor devils have gone home i" said an old tar, as a .crowd of the men piped down descended the main ladder. "Ay,' rejoined Bill, '" and a many a one, too, for she was a good lump of a craft." - Did you see her, then?" asked Tom, as he took -a double quid of tobacco from his mouth, and placed it in his south-wester. "Ay, by Jove, from the fourth rattlin of the fore- rigging." "Why did'nt you sing out, then?" I did, but it blew so hard I could'nt make .emn hear."   "What was she," demanded Tom, " a ship, or what?" "A ship," answered Bill, "I saw her crossjack yard." "How could you see her crossjack yard, When it was so dark that one could'nt see his hand? and what do you know about a yard, anyhow? you horse mnarine!" ' Who do you call a horse marine?" said Bill angri- ly; "I had tied a point before you thought of leaving Nova Scotia, you thundering blue-nose!" "'You! you north country lubber," said Torn. "If you're not careful, I'll venture a dozen or two for thle sake of flogging you. - What a liar you must be, to say you saw a ship's crossjack yard, when there's Jo Kel- lock, a forecastleman, who knows that neither her yards nor masts could be seen. WaTn't'it so, Jo?" "I saw her cuite plain," said Jo, " and her masts anid  rigging  " "Blue-nose! blue-nose!" said several.  "Docs Jo Kellock take the part of a blue-nose?:' "Who calls me a blue-nose?" called out the Nova 3cotian. " I wish we were ashore, I'd lick two or thlree f  you." , "Whalt do you say?" cried Bill; and as he spoke is bony fist came suddenly in contact with the Nova cotian's nose, which was not blue, but red-from the Tects of liquor; but before the blow could be returned veral stepped between them, saying., " What, fighting ,re! you'll be reported." "What are you doing?" demanded Bill. I've only t  him once, and as I shall be cat-o-nine-tailed anyhow- Ay not let me give it to him good?" ' That's my handwriting, too," shouted the blue-nose. ,et's have it out, and then go to the gangTway and be gged." "No, you don't!" said othels, (no fighting here,   OR THEI DlISlNHEllTElu.     . u,  you'll get us all in hot water; so quit your jaw, and away to your hammocksr for if this weather continues, you'll be wanted on deck shortly." So saying, theyv miade their way to their hammocks. Daylight came at last, that welcome visitor to anx- ious seamen, and Colborn, standing inside the bite of a rope fastened to belaying pins, to enable him to keep upon his feet, wet to the skin and cold, called for a cup of coffee, and having drank it, carelessly remarked, "I am now all right until seven bells." The rain had ceased, the southeast wind suddenly died away, and with a sudden shift came out from the northwest. At meridian the gale began to abate, and through the heavy clouds the sun's bright rays at times would penetrate, indicating pleasant weather. All on board were satisfied with the gallant Race Horse, for she had survived the heaviest gale that the oldest seaman on board had ever experienced, and yet received no injury. Meanwhile, the officers and crew had become pos- sessed of the fullest confidence in each other, and where such is the case, good discipline, contentmean, and hap- piness, generally rule on board of a ship. By six P. 31. the lieutenant of the watch had orders to make sail, and accordingly the foresail, fore topcal: lant staysail, and closed reefed topsails, were set upon her. On the following day the weather had become fine, the sky clear, and the tall frigate, under all sail; plowed the yet ruffled waters, presenting a far different ap- pearance from what she did not many hours before. The ship havingo arrived at the longxitude of twenty- .- : J: six degrees north, took the northeast trade winds, and having her studdingsails opened on the port side to its propelling force, dashed past the numerous sea-caps that were scattered over the surface of those blue waters.  ....   74       LIEUTENANT COL BORN, C H A?T E It X. TliE ARGUiENT. Lieutenant Colborn and Midshipman North prome- naded the deck in earnest conversation, but in a low tone of voice, for fear others might comprehend the subject of their colloquy. "And do you really intend to marry her?" asked North, casting upon his friend an inquiring look. "I do," was the reply, " and impatiently await the time when I can call her mine." "But have you weighed the numerous obstacles with due consideration?" asked the midshipman. "I have," answered the lieutenant in a determined manner. "I am sure," said North, " that you cannot be aware of all that should hinder you from taking such a down- ward step. Colborn cast an anxious look at the midshipman, and said, ' Why do you think I am not aware of all? Am I not possessed of common sense? am I a child?" "You are not a child; but excuse me when I say, that I certainly do not think you display a great degree of good sense in making such a plebeian selection." "And why?" demanded' Colborn. "I can. quickly say," answered the midshipman, ' if you will not be offended." "Oh, go on," said the lieutenant, " for what you say in truth will not offend me, and. as you are a gentleman, of course you will speak the truth."   75^ OR THE DISINIIERITED.       75  Firstly, then," began North, " she is-not in anyle :- . spect worthy to be your wife." "BIe sure you keep within the bounds of truth," cried Colborn, "for that must be the basis of your state- ments." You said," returned North, " that you would not be offended; so let that be the basis of your remarksY "She is but the daughter of a poor inn-keeper, with- out education, religion, accomplishments, or modesty, continued North. "'ris false," exclaimed the first lieutenant solo'd tht the officers walking on the leeside of the quarter deck looked over to windward in astonishment. 'iHold!" said North, "you said you would not be offended." "And 3you were to keep within the bounds of truth." "I think I have; shall I go on?" "Yes, go on," answered Colborn with asperity. "Well, then, your marriage with her would not only disgrace your parents and sister, but your relatives gen- erally; for of courso she possesses no accomplishments, and her appearance in society would be mortifying to yourself. I fear you would never after be received in the same circles you have been accustomed to. All this, while with your birth, fine and manly appearance, your excellent chara)ter and prospects, you could de- mand the hanrd of any of the fiune ladies.-of our ac-  quaintance. You seem to forget who yoq*ara.; You do not realize that you are the son and heir of a rich and honorable knight, that you are at an early a e -the  -first licuter1nant of a frigate, and, with your abilities and' prospects, bid fair to be an ornament. to the service. What you now should do, and by all tmeans, is to obtain , 0 the hand of a lady whoe8 family is rich ancd&influential.    "EUTENANT COLBORN,   You forget that at forty you will have different ideas upon this subject from what you now have, and that, should you unite with a lady of no influence, you wi:l- hereafter regret your infatuation. "Forget her, my friend, and on your return seek the hand of some lady of rank, one who will be worthy of your noble self. Do so, and you will win the esteem of all who know you, benefit yourself in all ways, become a pillar in the navy, conspicuous in the nation, an orna- ment to society, and the pride and hope of your family. But, on the other hand, unite yourself to this inn-keeper's daughter, and you will immediately disgrace your noble self, become detested by all your connections, and no longer be in the way of rising to eminence in the navy or nation; but, on the contrary, you will be slighted and even despised in society, you will bring down your fa- ther's proud spirit, and breakyour doating mother's heart, and your immaculate sister and numerous relatives. will look upon you as irrecoverably lost." "You speak like an orator," said William, ironically 6' but now  it is my turn to say a few words. I hold that neither my. family nor myself would be degraded  by my marriage with a person whose only fault is pov- erty. The man who becomes wealthy, no matter by what means, according to your argument, shuns dis- grace. The sharper having but one talent, and that for accumulating wealth, may be free from what you would term ignominy, while he who has many talents, and is high-.minded and honest, but still poor, must be looked down on in society. But worse than all, the imbecile, stupid as a  mule, is to be honored, simply because he is born to wealth and title. "No, sir; I  repeat that poverty is no disgrace. You made the assertion that she was not accomplished. Now   OR THE DISINHERITED.      " you promised to keep within the bounds of truth, buthave not, although perhaps unintentionally. She possesses a voice sweeter than that of the nightingale, and it is finely cultivated. I have sat for hours listening to her. sweet tones-their charm would soften the heart even of an aristocrat. She plays the guitar to perfection; - then you have seen yourself that she is graceful. "You asserted that she is not well educated, and pos- sesses neither religion nor modesty; all which is untrue! Much attention has evidently been paid to her educa- tion, and she is pious and modest, far more so than many of those same haughty ladies of rank you have alluded to. "Then, are you not aware that a lady rises or falls with her husband, and not he with her? Kate must rise to my level the instant she becomes my bride; and to be ashamed of her! Never! But, on the contrary, Ishall be proud to introduce her to my relatives and acquaintances, who will be anxious to solicit the society of one so superioi in every respect. Sir, there are those who, having wealth, education, birth, in fact, all advan- tages, are uncouth and unladylike still. Such are many in high life with whom you and I are acquainted. There also are those whose advantages have been lim- ited, yet still who are genteel and graceful; in fact, are superior to the great mass of persons. Such a one is my dear Kate - a perfect lady." "Then you do not admit," said North, " the superi- ority and advantages,of rank?" 'l Sir," nobly answered Colborn, "I admit, acknowl- edge, and bow to nothing in this world but genius, char- acter, merit, and education. I am a man of the people. The conduct of the/ Americans, and now the people of France, has influenc d my views very much of life in.   78,      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, this particular. I find that monarchical forms of govern- ment, aided by these same ideas of rank, and other in- fluences connected therewith, are crushing the people, and trampling upon the rights God has given them. Sir! cast your mind's eye over some of the affairs of our own country. The members of the royal family, tile bishops, members of the government, and others, receive enormous salaries; the country, kept constantly at war to maintain some foreign crown, which is of no benefit to one nation or the other, the giving of large dowries to foreign princes, and other unreasonable ex- penditures, drain the treasury, and are prolific causes for imposing taxation so heavily. "In France, the nobility and clergy were exempted from taxation, in order to maintain the luxurious, ex- travagant, and profligate court of the Bourbon Louis; consequently it fell so heavily upon the middle and low- er classes, that they were driven to desperation by the demands upon them, and overthrew their government, and formed a  national convention, which sentenced the king to death, as guilty of conspiracy against the na- tional liberty. He died by the guillotine, and his queen, Maarie Antoinette, that Austrianffemme ce mautvaise vie, soon followed, as well as his sister, the virtuous Madame 'Elizabeth, and his cousin, the duke of Orleans.  The remaining members of the family, and most of the no- bility, sought safety in other countries, principally in England; and although report says that Prince Louis was secretly murdered in France, yet it is not substan- tiated. "Austria and Prussia had previously declared war, and afterwards England, Holland, Spain, and nearly all the rest of the powers of Europe, combined against the French republicans, determined to extinguish the glo-   OR TIIE DISINHERITED.      79 rious sparks of liberty before they should augment to a general conflagration that would illuminate Europe and the world. They were in the end partially success- ful. But the aspiration for liberty is becoming more general, and even in our own country there were people who watched the progress of the French revolution; with feelings of sympathy for the revolutionists. ' Again, this same tyranny in taxing our brothers in America without allowing them the privilege of repre- sentation, will forever appear as a stain upon the reign of George the Third, for that act of tyranny and impo- sition upon those enterprising and loyal subjects caused the loss to England of the greatest, most wealthy, and most promising colonies she ever did or ever will pos- North had been walking all this time by the side of his superior officer in silence, listening to arguments he could not gainsay. He acknowledged the progress of republicanism in the United States, and some parts of Europe, but he could not believe that the rabble of most of the countries in Europe were sufficiently enlightened and educated to be able to govern themselves, nor strong enough to overthrow powerful governments, acting -l concert and having wealth, immense n-avies and armies, and other important influenzces to act upon the ignorant and superstitious masses, and he said: "I have listened to your arguments, Mr. Colborn, but must beg to differ from you in opinion. And may I ask if my friend is an enemy to his country?" "By no  means," promptly answered Colborn. "I am patriotic, but like thousands of our countrymen, am opposed to a monarchical form of government, sincerely believing that the masses are not benefited by such. I am in favor of that form of government that shall bene- fit millions instead of only thousands."   8LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "I presume," said North, "that you are willing to admit that what has existed and continues to exist, is more 'certain than what people say is to come; that there is a material difference between past fact and fu- ture expectation twe          a   d  "Admitted," replied Colborn. "Monarchical forms of government,"continued North hve permanently stood for centuries; but republi- canism is in its infancy.' "Republicanism is not so velyyoung,", said Colborn. Icould cite instances of nations having happily flour- ished under a republican form of governmen. Tflhe Venetian Republic was the seat of European wealth for a long time. The greatness of Rome, le misthess of the world, began with the republic, but declined un- der the empire. But I do not cite these instances spe cially to support my argurnent, as I do not t phink tha governments formed in those dark and ignorant ages should be held up as examples for nations ta follow in this enlightened century, but you lo Now, hllis en- lightenment is spreading; knowledg continues to in- crease with wonderful rapidity, penetrating into the midst  of the  masses iditY, penetrating  into  tto mist of the masses, where before it was a stranger and the time is at hand when there must be a change. Look around you! Are not millions of todden-down people waking from their long, deep lethargy? Is it not plain, that, since the scales of ignorance are drop- ping from their eyes, and the roused millions have thrown the bughears of privileged classes from their tall seats in PFrance, they will also fall in other countries?, "Do you not think," said North, "that good order and a proper submission to good and justlaws ought to be maintained, instead of mob-laws and the impulse of anarchy?iue "Yes," replied Colborn, bu laws enacted by kings tonbut laws enacted by kings   OR THE DISINHERITED.      81 and their subservient ministers are seldom good orjust, for the people seldom have any voice therein. If an- archy rule in a republic, the people must abide by what they cause, and they have the consolation to know that they have the freedom to make good order or bad order in society themselves  "Who, I ask, ought to govern a country but the peo- ple of that country? Sir, there was more anarchy and civil war in the quarrels of the houses of York and Lancaster than have ever taken place in any republic. Away with such cringing sycophancy to monarchy! And I 'think there is reason to believe that there will be a different form of government than now exists in Eng- land, ere we return." "I hope, then," said North sarcastically, " that we will at least do better than we did under the Protectoiate!" "Why so?" said Colborn.  "England flourished  wonderfully in those eleven years." "Admitted," said North reluctantly, "but do not mention that brute Cromwell, for his character was de- testable.; ' "You aire prejudiced against him," said Colborn, "because he was not royal." "Cromwell! I detest the very name," said North,. vehemently. "You detest it," replied the first lieutenant, " because you are an aristocrat. But it is time to go below.-- Meanwhile, you have not convinced me that my dear Kate is not worthy of me, nor that the people should not be equal with the king. Hurrah for democracy! Good night." "Nor you," cried the midshipman, "that they are equal to him. God save the king! Good night." And they descended to their respective apartments. 5   82       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER XI. THE EXECUTION AND ESCAPE. Let us now give our attention to scenes about to be enacted at Winchester. The morning of the fatal day appointed for the exe- cution of Fellows and his companion had arrived, and thousands were assembled in the open space before the town-house. Although the crowd was so great, there was a stillness over all in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion. Those who addressed each other spoke in low tones, but by far the greater part of them re- mained perfectly quiet. The eyes of the people were turned upon the town- house, in front of which two scaffolds had been erected. The time fixed was eleven o'clock A. AM., when two hu- man beings were to be strangled to death} and forced hurriedly into the presence of their Creator. It is awful to know that man deprives his fellow-man of what God has given him, sending the soul prematurely into the presence of its Maker, before Hie has demanded it! But, as good order in society, and the security of life demand it, we are obliged to darken the history of na- tions with executions. The escape from capital punish- ment of murderers has, no doubt, on the average, been the cause of the homicide of half a dozen others. Hence, the execution of a culprit may be looked upon as saving the lives of half a dozen. As proof of this, in those countries where homicide is'surely punished   OR THE DISINHERITED. I     83 with- death, the cowardly crime of murder is seldom known; while where the death punishment is often com- muted to imprisonment, the crime often occurs. In fact, there life and property are not safe. A large party of policemen surrounded the scaffolds, and others were stationed in different parts to preserve good order. The clock struck the hour of eleven. All eyes were- fixed upon the scaffolds, and the moving multitudes around them, swaying like a long ground swell at sea, told that the expected prisoners were coming. One, and by his side a clergyman, was led through the line of guards, and ascended the scaffold. The clergyman having knelt and uttered a last prayer for the soul now about to take its flight, the executioner placed around his neck the fatal rope. . The blocks were knocked from beneath his feet, and, suspended in air, Fletcher gave two struggles, as if trying to avoid his fate, and nothing but lifeless clay remained of him who hadc deprived others of their lives, as well as property. All eyes had been so drawn to the scene, that for a few moments they had forgotten the other expected crimi- nal. But now a murmur of "Where's the other?" ran through the crowd. A rush of guards, followed by an immense crowd, was seen pushing towards the prison, and soon a cry of "He's escaped, he's gone!" fell upon the ears of the multitude. Great confusion now reigned through the crowd. A general search commenced, and thousands rushed to and fro, they knew not whither. "Now or never!" said Fellows to himself, and quick as thought he swung the heavy irons on his wrists against the warden's temple so powerfully, thatithe lat- ter fell to the floor insensible. Fellows then took the   84       LIEUTENANT COLBORE, keys from the fallen man, with which he unfastened the irons upon his wrists, and stripping off the outer gar- ments of the official, put them on himself. Then closing the door, he swung the ponderous keys from side to side to create deception, and passing down the corridor by the unsuspecting guards at the gate, he mixed with the crowd in the street undiscovered. He passed along with the dense mass of people, when, fearing he might be recognized, he entered an old uninhabited dwelling, and concealed himself in the chimney. Here he remained in horrible suspense until dark, when he ventured out, and with a careless gait, to appear as much like a citizen as possible, strolled through the principal street, and reached the outskirts of the town. -He had indeed made a narrowescape, for even until a late hour men were searching in all di- rections, and he had passed close by many. As the forests and mountains in front became visible by the light of the rising moon, and the last scattering houses of the outskirts of Winchester became lost to view behind him, Fellows, wicked as he was, knelt lowly upon the ground, and in humble gratitude thanked his Creator for his escape,- that Creator who, in His infi- nite goodness, does not refuse to forgive poor, weak, and erring man his sins, however depraved. Before morning he came in sight of a forest, and penetrating its inmost thicket, he concealed himself be- neath some broken branches, covered with brush, and fell asleep. It was past four on the following afternoon ere ex- hausted nature had been satisfied. He arose and left the forest, and traveled nearly all night, when, forced by hunger, he stopped in front of a cottage, but, espying a well-laden pear tree in the yard, he climbed it, and   OR THE DISINHERITED. &     85 after satisfying his appetite with the delicious fruit, he descended, and without arousing the inmates of the cot- tage, proceeded on to the next woods. Here, again, he found a convenient place of security, and laid down for the day. In this manner, living on fruit, traveling by night and sleeping by day, he arrived at Hurst, a little village just back of the Isle of Wight. It was late in the evening when he entered the little seaport, and, filled now with the hope that his vessel might be there, and thus secure to him the means of refuge and flight; and anon with fear that she might be absent, and he, be obliged to remain, he knew not how long, where he would be liable to be detected, - he wandered down to the land. ing, and asked a boatman if the brigantine Nancy, a trader to France, had arrived. "She has been here for some time," answered the boatman, " as many-know, for she is suspected of being a smuggler, or something worse." "I wish to lie put on board of her," said Fellows, good-naturedly. And well he might feel joyous, after having been favored with so much good fortune. He stepped into the boat, and as she left the shore he looked behind and smiled to think he was past all dan- ger. The boat touched the vessel's side, and he sprang up the ladder, and with a light heart stepped on the deck of his own Nancy! 'Who's that?" asked the officer of the deck in a gruff voice. "Who are you, to dare to come on board at this hour o' night without permission?" "(No enemy- and I wish to see your master," was the reply. The captain ascended to the deck, and Fellows grasp- ed his hand, and exclaimed, "Harvey, don't you know   86,  -    LIEUTENANT COLBORN, me? I'm glad to see you, and can assure you that the Nancy has the finest appearance to my eyes of any ob- ject I have seen for weeks, for I am nearly famished, and pursued by policemen in all directions." "Come below," said the captain; and they descended to the cabin, where he soon partook of food and wine. "How long since you visited London?" asked Fel- lows: "About two weeks," answered the captain. "How is Hubert, and others of our friends?" "All well." ;' Why .did not Hubert or old Peg endeavor to obtain my release?" "I do not know, as I remained there but one day." "I presume," said the chief, sarcastically, " that they were glad to get rid of me, in order to divide the spoils." Then, walking up and down the floor, he asked the cap- tain what he had been doing lately. "I have been cruising about the Scilly Isles the great- er part of the time for the last two months." "Allow me to see your books," asked Fellows. Harvey produced them, and there being a large bal- ance shown in the vessels favor, the chiefgood-natured- ly remarked that he should need it all, as he had lost much of late. "You," continued he, " have been more fortunate than I have; but it appears you are suspected of being a smuggler! Did you know it?" "I did not, sir." "Well, you are, and must put to sea as early as pos- sible. Are your crew on board? When can you go?" "I can sail at once." "What! to-night,?" "Ay! as easily as by day; I'm well acquainted about here."   OR THE DISINI-ERITED i     87 "Proceed at once, then!" said Fellows. Presently the crew were heaving at the windlass, and in a few minutes she was underway' A thick mist at times accompanied the moderate southwest wind, but the weather was not bad, and as the little clipper bound- ed over the water, Fellows walked the deck, musing on the eventful life he had lately led. The brigantine might have measured two hundred tons. Her shear was designated from quite a distance by a narrow red bead that surrounded her. Her low rails fell in, and following her shear were lost to nothing at the quarters. The quarter deck, raised several feet above the main, gave ample height to her splendid cab- in. Beneath the bows of the long-boat, lashed to ring- bolts amidships, was concealed a large cannon, mounted on a pivot. Her decks were polished white by the use of holy- stones, her lofty spars raked saucily, and, taken all in all, the Nancy, of London, was as fine a craft as plowed the waters of the English channel. Having beat to windward two days, when the weath- er became bad, and threatening to be worse, he told his owner it would be better to enter a port for safety. ' What port can you enter?" anxiously asked Fel- lows. "Oh!" said the skipper, laughing, " any of them on this coast; whichever one we fetch on this tack will answer." A cry of land, ho! was soon heard, and the well- known shores of England were approached. "What port shall we reach?" asked Fellows, wishing to keep as far as possible from the vicinity of Win- chester. "This, here," answered the captain, " is the harbor of   88       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Plymouth, and if we are' lucky, we'll be safely anchored before dark." The brigantine soon reached the entrance to the har- bor, sailed in past the outer shipping, and anchored in' safety.. On the following morning Fellows, having attired himself in a suit of blue, and wearing a cap, to appear as an officer of a vessel, accompanied by Harvey, pro- ceeded on shore. They traveled carelessly up the street for a considerable distance, when Fellows remarked that he should like to take a drink. "And so should I," said the other; " so let us go over to old Pederson's.' And they turned into Pell street. Kate now seldom appeared in the bar-room, as her time was now occupied in improving herself in such fe- male accomplishments as she would, in all probability, at some future time require; but by chance was at her old place when Fellows and Harvey entered. "By the curse of old Peg!" exclaimed Fellows, in a low tone, " but that's a pretty girl! who is she? the bar-maid, eh!" "Ay! and you are not the only man who thinks she's pretty." "I declare, she is the prettiest female I ever saw!' whispered Fellows, as Kate rose from her seat and gracefully moved from the room. "aBut it is useless for you to admire her," said Htar- vey, " for she is engaged to a lieutenant in the navy.1" "Is that true?" "So says report." "What kind of a place is this?" asked Fellows, cast- ing his eyes around the room, " respectable, of course." "Quite so," replied his companion. "Do they accommodate lodgers? for if they do, I   OR THE DISINIIERITED.     89 shall remain here a while, and endeavor to form her ac- quaintance." "They do occasionally," answered the captain. "Then I should like to be introduced to the land- lord." Mr. Pederson!" said Harvey, respectfully, " allow me to introduce to you Mr. Carey, the owner of the Nancy." "I am happy to make your acquaintance," said Mr. Peclerson, extending his hand to Fellows. "Mr. Carey wishing to obtain lodgings," said Har- vey, "I have taken the liberty to recommend him to vour care."' "I am extremely obliged to you; but we only take a friend occasionally, more for company than profit, but," - glancing at the fine-looking and intelligent coun- tenance of Fellows - he continued, "I'll speak to my daughter upon the subject." Kate having no objection, it was arranged that Mr. Fellows, alias Carey, should become a lodger at the inn. "I am really in love with that girl," said Fellows, as they walked down the street, " and shall do my best to win her. I presume I can risk to remain here a 'short time, although the police are searching for me in many parts of the country. Do you not think so, Harvey?" "Oh! ay! for this is a long way from Winchester, and besides, they could not recognize you in your pres- ent trim." On the following day, Fellows, seated at Mr. Pe- derson's table, had a fine view of Kate, and by his gen- flemanly deportment and vast information, won the esteem of the host and his fair daughter. He was dressed elegantly, in the style of the day, and with his 6'   90       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, prepossessing manners, might be considered a danger- ous rival to even as fine a man as William Colborn. He remained at the inn for several days, during which time he held much conversation with the family, and had made advances of love to Kate, - although in such a delicate, rpodest, and gentlemanly manner that no of- fense could be taken, --yet all in vain;' for she would listen to nothing that had a tendency to compromise her previous engagement; yet received his advances in a spirit of friendship, and could not but feel compli- mented.   OR THE DISINERITED,      91 OCHAPTER   XII. THE FIGHT. Fellows, not having succeeded in obtaining her affec- tions, and overhearing two gentlemen in earnest con- versation concerning the escape of himself from the Winchester prison, became alarmed, and concluded to leave England immediately. Accordingly, after bid- ding Mr. Pederson and his daughter a friendly adieu, and leaving upon their minds the most favorable im] pressions, he repaired on board the brigantine, and, as a fine breeze' blew from the northwest, the Nancy was soon again in the channel. She cruised about for many days, more for the pur- pose of keeping Fellows in safety than for purposes of gain; but, on a clear, moonlight evening, off the en- trance of the channel? two large ships were discovered not far distant. "Those ships are men-of-war," said the captain to Fellows, " and no doubt are convoying merchantmen. Keep a good look-out!" continued he, addressing his' first officer. ' Sail, ho!' cried the look-out, as a third ship was seen following the men-of-war. "Where away?' ' Two points on the weather bow, sir!' "Sail, ho!" shouted the mate, as still another ship hove, in sight, H Here is a chance for us," said the captain) rubbing   921      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, his hands, "for ships under convoy sometimes carry valuable cargoes." "What do you mean?" asked Fellows, who was not familiar with sea terms, or sea robbery. "A large fleet of Indiamen are under the convoy of those frigates," answered the experienced captain. "And what chance have we with them, in a small vessel like this?" asked Fellows. "a The chance of pouncing upon one of the tardy logs, that has been left far behind, if we choose to make the attempt." "What articles of value would such a vessel be likely to have on board?" "The valuable productions of India, and perhaps a quantity of specie." "' That would do," observed Fellows, his eyes bright- ening. "Shall we board one?" queried the captain. "By all means," answered Fellows; but he after- wards modified what he had said to " do as you please." Another, and yet another ship rolled along before the southwest wind. "There!" said Harvey to his mate, C what think you of that one, just to windward -of us?" The rough mate shook his head, and answered that he did not like her appearance. "For," continued he, "she's too large, and besides, too near the fleet." ; Keep a bright look-out!" said the captain, "for if the next one that is alone is not too heavy, we'll try her." "Sail, ho!" cried a voice forward, as the bright rays of the moon shone upon the white canvas .of another ship. "There 1" said the mate, as the stranger drew nearer,   OR THE DISINHIERITED.     -93 G she's a small snip, and no other one is near, so we can talre her easily." ' Every man to his station!" cried the captain; and the order was' instantly obeyed. The stranger had reached within half a mile, when the brigantine was kept away a little, and, the fuill force of the wind acting on her swelling sails, she leaped as if with new life through the water.' "Is the pivot gun well manned?" demanded the anx- ious skipper. "All ready, sir." "All ready with the small arms?" "Aye! aye! sir." The little craft had now reached within pistol-shot of the stranger, sailing directly across her bows. "( Stand by to fire the pivot gun! and be sure to rake her." "Aye! aye! sir." "All ready?" All ready, sir." "Iold I hold!" cried the captain. "Oh God! she's a man-of-war!  Hard a-port! Show a signal lantern!" "Brigantine, ahoy!" shouted a gruff voice through a trumpet from  the quarter-deck of the sloop-of-war; for such she proved to be. "Holloa!" answered Harvey, as he leaped towards the mate, saying to him, hastily, u' Cover up the gun, or we are loft!" "What vessel is that?" "The Wasp, of Liverpool; from  Newcastle bound to Lisbon." "What's your cargo?'7 "Coals."  "Well,what the devil are you doing underourbows,   "       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Mr. lubber?" cried the officer of the deck petulantly; and other expletives, quite as complimentary, were the last words distinguishable as the ship sailed away, and the brigantine, hauling her wind, bounded to windward. "What the devil were you about, Harvey?" demand- ed Fellows. "Do you not know a man-of-war from a merchantman? I came here for safety; but it seems am in more danger than on shore." "I am not often deceived, though," said the skipper, "and it might have been worse." "Sail, ho!" was again the cry. "Another man-of-war," muttered Fellows. "Demme I I'd rather be chased by policemen! "Perhaps not," calmly remarked the captain. "No mistake this time!" said the mate, as the strang- er approached quite near. "My life on her being a merchantman." "What say you," said Harvey to Fellows, " shall we board her?" "You know best!" was the reply, given in an unde- cided manner. "Stations again!" cried the captain. c6 Keep her off! steady! so! Stand by to grapple! Are you ready? "All ready."  I- Hard a-starboard, and let her go alongside." The next instant the brigantine touched her side, and the active grapplers fastened the two vessels together, by means of ropes rove through the stranger's chain- plates'. "Boarders, away!" cried the captain, and the next instant the mate and fifteen stout men, all armed with pistols and short swords, ascended her side and leaped on her decks, amidst her astonished crew. A fight now ensued. Harvey and the remaining i!   OR THE DISINMERITED ,     95 i fea of his crew now leaped on board to assist their shipmates, and, as the sharp sound of pistol shots fell on the ears of Fellows, a music that had often greeted them, he, too, was aroused, and soon his tall figure ap- peared on the rail of the ship, and then upon her bloody decks. The affair was soon over; the captain of the stranger surrendered. Three had been killed and several wound- ed, which was but a trifling loss, compared with what might have been expected. But signal guns had been fired, which would soon bring assistance from the armed ships. So Harvey hastily demanded of the captain to produce his manifest. The captain hesitated. ", Your manifest!" cried Fellows. Hie still hesitated. Fellows, judging by the captain's appearance that the wished-for document contained .something he did not yish them to see, and knowing their time was lim- ited, seized him by the throat, and plhcing his pistol to his breast, said, in a determined manner, "Produce your manifest, or daylight shall shine through your body instantly." The captain gave up,his papers. The manifest proved that eight kegs of specie, four hundred packages of rich goods from India, and other valuables, were on board of her. "All right," cried Fellows. "Wherb is the specie?" It was soon found and conveyed to the brigantine, and Harvey exclaimed, with joy, "Lucky to the last. Nothing venture, nothing gain." "C ome, now, let's be off,"5 said Fellows., "Shall we not take some of those rich packages?I asked Harvey.   96      LIEUtTENANT COLBORN, "By no means," was the reply. "Let well enough alone. There are, without doubt, ships-of-war ap- proaching." They leaped on board their vessel, cast off the fasts, and separating from the ship, made all sail, and bounded away to the northward. "- How much, think you, they each contain?" asked Fellows, with a smile, as he surveyed the sealed kegs before him. "Five thousand pounds in each." "By the spirit of old Peg, this is better than work- ing on the road. I wish I were a sailor. But, come, let's drink to our good fortune. Call down the officers. Send the best of liquors to the men - heigh! ho!" They drank, but not to excess, nor were-the crew supplied with more than could be drank in safety. At daylight a ship was descried astern, and making for them. As Harvey placed his experienced eye to the glass, he exclaimed, without any hesitation: "We are chased, and by a lofty-looking craft, to'o!" "Do you think she will overtake us,?" asked Fel- lows, anxiously. "I think not, unless the breeze increases to a gale. In that case, a larger vessel would have the advantage; but in a fair, moderate breeze like this, I'll put the Nan- cy against anything in these parts."  And as he spoke, he looked aloft with pride at her nicely fitting sails. All sail was now crowded upon both the vessels, but throughout the day the Nancy proved the' better sailer, and at last had left the stranger so far behind, that all on board were in high spirits, and applauded her to the skies. The sun disappeared behind a bank of clouds in the   OR THE DISINHERITEDo       9t west, just before the reached the horizon, and Harvey cast in that direction a suspicious look, as if he feared an increase of wind. Still the Nancy sped on, fully holding the advantage she had gained in distance over her large pursuer. At night, the cloud-bank arose from the horizon, spreading gloomily over the heavens, and with it the breeze increased greatly, and obliged the vessels to take - in their light sails, and bowse tight their braces. By ten o'clock P. Al., the breeze increased so much that the ship could with the greatest difficulty carry her topgallant sails, and the little Nancy was obliged to reef. Harvey walked the deck with rapid strides, for he well -  knew that the ship was now gaining upon his little craft. Daylight came, and told too well that his fears had been realized, for the frigate was scarcely three miles astern ;- and, as a chase gun, and yet another, boomed over the water, the heart of every man on board the brigantine sank wlthi-n him. "I fear," said Fellows, in a doleful tone, that my eventful career is about ended; it is evident we shall be taken, and what we have done, you know, will stamp us , as pirates!" A shot passed through the mainsail, but yet the little clipper kept on, leaping over and through the sea, as if determined yet to win the race. Another shot whizzed over their heads through the rigging.  The frigate continued to gain. "It's all up with us now," said the mate, "for the frigate is luffing to, to give us a broadside. We had better surrender without further ado!"  "Not so fast with your surrendering," said Harvey, cheerfully. "The Scilly Isles are in sight, and I will yet play them a trick they don't dream of!"   98    .   LIEUTENANT COLBORN, And such was the case, for the land appeared to sud- denly loom up above the thick mist hanging over it, and at no great distance. The brigantine seemed to leap anew, as if some charm existed amongst those rocks to draw her towards them. The experienced hand of Harvey steered his vessel; he watched her every movement, unmindful of the boom- ing cannon. She neared the rocks, and plunged at them as if to dash in pieces -amongst the breakers, when lo! a little opening between two high bluffs appeared, just wide enough to admit her entrance. She dashed on through the little passage, leaving rocks, breakers, and frigate behind, and was in safety. "Not this time!" jocosely observed Harvey, as he gave up the helm to a sailor. "But, by the virtue in a buntline, that frigate sails!" "Shall we remain here in this little harbor?" contin- ued he, addressing Fellows, "or proceed through the channel into the open sea north of all these islets, and far from the frigate?" Fellows grasped the captain's hand with gratitude, and said: "Harvey, greatest of all seamen, I'll not for- get that you saved my life this day. Proceed through the channel north and to London, so that we can place our treasure in safety." The Nancy having threaded her way through many intricate passages among the isles and rocks with which those seas abound, before dark rounded the Seven Stones, and shaped her course for the Lizard Point. '"Is there now no danger of meeting the frigate, or some other vessel of war?" asked Fellows. "Not the slightest," answered the captain, ' for no large vessels go on our route, and but few pilots dare venture where we are now; so be easy, for in safety we will proceed to London."   OR THE DISINHERITED.      99 As t ev passed the Eddystone Rock, Fellows cast a wishful'look towards Plymouth, and said," Harvey! What shall I do to win that girl?" "Win the pretty bar-maid? I know not what to say, for it appears she is already betrothed; but there have been girls won under circumstances quite as unpropi- tious-and you know 'Faint heart never won fair lady'!" "I shall go and see her again," said Fellows, " for I love her dearly." On arriving at the Downs, a manifest was made out from Plymouth to London in ballast, and the vessel proceeded up the river. It was midnight when she arrived off Blackwall. The boat was manned, the specie placed, in her, and Fellows getting on board, she dropped up with the'flood, and silently approached the sewer that fnarked the en- trance of the secret passage to the retreat of the rob- bers. Keg after keg was passed into the sewer, until the eighth had disappeared in the dark cavity. Fellows and Harvey proceeded through the subterranean pass- age, followed by the men who conveyed the precious metal. They lighted torches, and proceeded on through ldoor after door, which opened as if by magic as the practiced hand of Fellows touched their secret springs. "'All right," said he, as they arrived beneath the houses heretofore described. "I feared there might have been some change since I was here, but Hubert has kept things in order." And they ascended through a trap-door, and were upon the floor of the dwelling of their leader. "Where's the watch?" cried he.  "All asleep? Keep no watch now, or have you all become honest men?        ..   100      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Hubert's well known voice was now heard repri- manding servants, and the next instant he appeared and welcomed the man who, amongst those hardy and dis- honest men, was a mighty chief. The specie was conveyed to a closet, and filling their glasses, they drank to the good fortune that had not failed to hover over them, while they mourned the un- fortunate fate of Fletcher. t1s         OR THE DISINHERI TED.     101 CHAPTER    XIII. THE LETTER. Melissa sat in the drawing room of the elegant man- sion at Mount Prospect., She was quite young, yet had lived long enough to be imbued with the pride of her mother. She gazed into the garden, but whether her mind dwelt upon its numerous plants; upon the fash- ionable party who had graced the mansion a few nights previous; upon this or that fine young gentleman of her acquaintance; or upon her absent betrothed, George North, it would be difficult for us to say. A servant entered, presented her a letter, and withdrew. She looked at the superscription, and knew immediately it was from George. She leisurely opened it, without showing any particu- lar emotions of pleasure, and arose from her seat, left the apartment, ascended to her boudoir, and having thrown herself carelessly upon a lounge, perused its contents: RIo DE JANEIRO, Oct. 26th, 17-. DEAR MELISSA:- It is now nearly three months since we were separated by unhappy fate. After we left Plymouth, all went'on well as usual on board of a frigate at sea, until the evening of the 17th, when there came on a tre- mendous gale. The lightnings flashed; the thunder roared; and the seas ran mountains high. Once the ship lurched upon her side as if never more to right;   102      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, then she bounded on to an unknown vessel, which with all on board sank to rise no more. All hands were kept on deck, to preserve the frigate and their lives!-and oh! Melissa! all that night I thought of thee! We arrived here two days since, and in a few days will proceed on our voyage. William is well. I regret that it becomes my painful duty to communicate to you an error that he is in a fair way of committing, calcu- lated to wound the feelings of his family and friends, when known. There is a poor girl, the daughter of an inn-keeper at Plymouth, whose beauty, and no doubt, artful manners, have won the affections of your noble brother. He declares that he is betrothed to her, and that his nuptials will be celebrated on his return home. He also seems to be imbued with the low ideas of re- publicanism. I have endeavored to dissuade hirm from his infatua- tion; but in vain. We have had several serious argu. ments upon both subjects; but I can not convince him that he is wrong in either. It is really a pity that so promising a gentleman stoops so low as to think of this girl, or to plebeian principles. Forgive me for writing what may appear to you -as underrating the worth of your dear brother and my friend. That is farthest from my thought. I would that William Colborn had those dignified and lofty principles possessed by his lovely sister; indeed, than this there is but one wish that has control in my heart, and that one I will at some future time disclose to my dear Melissa. Please pre- sent my sincere regard to your parents, and believe me your unalterably attached, G-EORoX Melissa folded the letter, and with an air of offended   OR THE DISINHERITED.      103 pride, descended to the drawing room. She did not wish to be the firstto disclose such sad news to her mother; but knew that it would not do to keep the se- cret locked in her own bosom. What then could she do? . Inform her father? Yes, it was her duty to in- form at least one of her parents, and she repaired to his study, where she was met with her accustomed welcome. "Why, my dear," said Sir William, " the sad look upon that fair. brow? No bad news from our friend, Mr. North, I hope?" "No bad news from him, father, but," said she, as she kissed him, and sorrowfully glanced upon his cheer- ful countenance, "I can not say as much of the news from William," and she burst into tears. "You alarm me! speak, dear child, and let me know the worst at once." Melissa handed him the letter, and as he read the as- tonishing lines, his features became pale as marble. "' Can it be possible," said he, " that my dear son can so far forget himself! This is indeed sad news, my child, and I deeply regret that I must announce it to your mother," and so saying he took her hand, and they descended to the drawing room. "It is strange we have not received a letter from William," said he to Mrs. Colborn. "I think he must have written," said Mrs. Colborn, ".as he never neglects us when he is absent. But why do you look so sad? And Melissa in tears! Have you learned bad news?" "Melissa has received a letter from Mr. North," said he, "which she places at our disposal to read. I have read .it;" and he placed it in her hand. The haughty lady read, until she reached the line that gave informa- tion of the betrothal of her son; she could go no fur- ther. The letter fell from her hand, and she fainted.   104      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Water! water!" cried the general, and pulling the bell-rope furiously, several servants rushed in at once. She soon recovered, was placed upon a sofa, and the servants withdrew. "Well, dear," said the general, "I hardly consider this so serious, after all, for perhaps William has only been flirting with the girl, as is the custom with most young men. I can not thinlk that our son thinks of mar- riage with such a person." As he spoke he assumed a cheerful look, and walking to his son's portrait, exclaimed "That boy disgrace the proud name of Colborne? never!" "If it were only a flirtation," sighed Mrs. Colborn, "I would not care so much; but William is too candid, too noble and honorable by nature to deceive a girl, no matter how low she is by birth. Then I cannot conceal it from myself that he always possessed proclivities of a plebeian character, but whom he took them from I do not know; certainly not from me!" "And do you really think," asked the general, " that William intends to unite himself to this girl?" "The letter so states," replied Mrs. Colborn. "I fear there is too much cause to believe the foolish boy will thus throw himself away. I fear it is too true, for he often went to Plymouth, when it puzzled me to know what was the business that took him there." s"I had hoped," said Melissa, " that Ida had made an impression on William's heart; but he did not appear to be at all charmed with her."' "Even if he has become enamored of this bar-maid," said the general, now becoming a little convinced that it was true, "William,-with his good sense and judgment, will scorn the idea of marriage, when he con- siders all the disadvantages of such an alliance; and being influenced by Mr. North, he will long ere his re- ; -s-   OR THE DISINHERITED.     105 turn cast her from his mind in disgust. Do not be at all uneasy about our noble William, for, depend upon it, we will never have to blush for him." A servant announced that Lord North had just en. tered.  "Oh, dear!" cried Airs. Colborn, nearly fainting again, "' I am all in tears! What shall I do! Go, William, and you, Melissa, but I am not well enough to see him. Esxcuse me as being quite indisposed, and do not by any means let him know of the sad news of, William." "I have no doubt," said the general, "but that his son has already informed him." "Oh! I did not think of that," sobbed Mrs. Colborn, "Oh! this strange conduct of -my son has so humbled me that I can not meet Lord North now." General Colborn extended his hand to Lord North, which was received with that ease which marked a gen- tleman of the old school; and Melissa endeavored to assist in entertaining her future father-in-law. '"-lEow is Mrs. Colborn?" asked Lord North, "It is some time since I had the pleasure of, meeting her." "To-day," answered the general, " she has been quite indisposed, but generally she is in excellent health." "I regret to hear it," remarked Lord North, "I have received a letter from my son, and came to inform you of it." "We have also received one," said the general, wish- ing to evade a question upon 'that point." "It appears," said Lord North, " that the frigate en- countered a tremendous storm, a short time after sail- ing, and ran down another ship." "Yes," said Sir William, " a very sad affair; but the frigate braved it nobly," and he fixed his eye intently upon Lord North, but could detect nothing in his coun- 6   106      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, tenance that showed he had been informed of William's weakness. "Our sons," continued he, "have to en- counter many dangers and privations at sea, and when they are at home, we ought to do all we can to make their time pass pleasantly." "My abhorrence of the sea," said Lord North, " and other reasons, have caused me often to regret that I placed my son in that branch of the service, and I have serious intentions of taking him from the navy." "-But," sid Sir William, (' it is a very honorable and aristocratic branch." "Admitted; but George is my only child, and if he should be taken' from me, I should never more be happy." " Then you do not think," said the general, " that a man is just as safe at sea as on shore, or abroad as at home." "Not by any means," answered Lord North. "Then you do not believe in destiny," said Sir William. "To a certain extent. I am of opinion that one must shun danger if he wishes to prolong life," said his lord- ship. "I know that there is more mortality at Rio, in propbrtion to the number of inhabitants, than at Lon- don. How, then, can it be as safe at Rio as at the lat- ter place?" "People die in London," answered the general, " after having lived for years in sickly cities. I am of opinion we have our allotted time to live, and then we die." "I can not see it so," said Lord North, and changed the subject to the crops, their prospects, and the tenant- ry; and then their conversation had reference to the new administration of government, and, although, when men get disputing on politics, they seldom make short   OE TjEI DISINHERITED.     107 work of it, yet in this instance it was soon wound up. Lord North arose, and presenting his hand to Melissa, begged her to remember him to her mother, and bade her adieu; then, accompanied by Sir William, he took a short walk about the grounds, entered his carriage, rode down the lawn, and from Mount Prospect.   108      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, C HAPTER XIV THE ACT OF TYRANNY. Otaheite and the surrounding islands were still brightened by a tropical sun; and their shores were still washed by the great Pacific's blue, clear, and briny waters. The forest of tall cocoanut, the multitudinous " branches of bread fruit, the long leaves of banana, plantain, and other tropical fruit trees, were bowing and waving in submission to the steady trade- wind that perpetually blows across these latitudes of that vast ocean. Numerous and various tropical fruits, and the most luxuriant vegetation, still grew, at all seasons of the year. Myriads of beautiful birds, of- various kinds and of different sizes and colors, flying to and fro, and leaping from limb to limb, still sung sweetly, re-echoing their harmonious strains, from tree to tree, The numerous fishes still swam lazily about its shores, and as if partaking of the lassitude that seems to charac- terize every living thing in the warm clime, through the crystal waters could be seen playing around the rocks, or through and beneath the coral trees that stretch their broad branches from the bottom, and thousands of hap- py people still live, love, and continue to populate those beautiful gardens of the most perfect paradise known in modern days; and kneeling lowly in thankfulness to the great Giver of all things, for that plenty, good   OR THE DISINHERITED.      109 health, contentment of mind, and perfect happiness be- fore unprecedented in the annals of the history of na- tions, they still ask,' if He in his marvelous goodness shall see fit, for a continuation of the same great bless-e ings. Toono, in all her natural loveliness, sat by the side of her dear Harry. The house, mats, curtains, guns, and little ornaments remained the same as when we accom- panied them over hills, through forests, deep in the val- leys, or over the blue waters that washed the shores of this island paradise. No great change of importance  had taken place in their little cabin, more than is quite natural to the human family. A fine, plump boyv played upon the mats, and ever and anon, cast his black eyes upon his father. He was pretty in complexion, between the nut-brown color of his mother, and the pure white of his European father, with just tinge enough of the former to please many admirers of beauty; although for me, the pure white skin, with rosy cheeks and lips, is preferable to any other style of complexion. "I fear, dear Toono," said her husband thoughtfully, c' that our long enjoyment of so much bliss is soon to end; or at least to be interrupted." "Why so?" asked Toono, "speak quick, for your looks indicate some dreadful fear." "I have been told by Christiam to-day, that the news of the mutiny has spread throughout England, and that the government has taken steps for our arrest; in- deed, that an armed vessel is already on her way to these islands for that purpose," "But why should they wish to arrest you? You are doing  them  no harm, and are far away from England." "To bring us to justice," replied Harry, " and make   "O      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, an example of us, for the general good of the nation." Such, say they, is their object. "Well, let them come!" said Toono, tossing up her beautifully shaped head, in a defiant manner. "Let them come; but they can never find you, for I will con- ceal you in so deep and dark a dungeon, that, if thev enter it, they will not be able to find their way out in safety again," and muttering a bitter imprecation on the English for daring to meddle with the affairs of these islands,' she allowed her head to assume its former po- sition. "Are you sure you can conceal me from them, and support me with food for a long time?" asked her husband, " for they will stay and search until their de- sign is accomplished." "I am sure I can," confidently answered his wife. "I will go to Christian," said Harry, '" and ask him all about this expedition against us," and immediately he departed. As he entered Christian's cabin, Torquil, Stewart, and Haywood were present, all indulging in a game at cards. "Holloa! Harry!" exclaimed Christian, " glad to see you; just in time for a game,-sit down!" Harry obeyed, and joining the game, he asked for news. "News!" exclaimed Torquil with surprise; "have you not heard the news?" ' I have not, more than a flying report that the gov- ernment is about to send out a force to capture us." "About to send!" 'cried Torquil, 'bthey have already sent, and yourself and your dear Toono will, no doubt ere long, be obliged to separate; for it appears that they are determined to dissipate our happiness by hunt- ing us from this island."    -oR THE DISNIaERITED.     Il  "Where did you get the information?" asked Harry, "there has been n6o vessel here of late that could have brought it." "It seems," said Christian, "that a whale ship, which touched at the Windward Island, gave currency to the report, and it flew from island to island, till it reached Otaheite." "And do you believe it is true?" asked Harry. "We do," answered Christian, " for it is reasonable. Captain Bligh and others having arrived in England, are living witnesses as to the mutiny of the Bounty, and if- we are taken, he will be in readiness to recog- nize us, and swear away our lives." "But they do not know where we are," said Harry, hoping if possible to find an argument to refute the re- port. "They do, though," said Haywood, " for did we not unwisely shout, huzza for Otaheite! when we set them adrift in the boat? And besides they were aware of our dear attachments on this island." "And that's not all," said Stewart, " for several ves- sels have called here since that time, and their officers and crews having seen us, of course reported the same when they arrived in Europe." "Then you are of opinion, we may expect an unwel- come visitor here before long?" asked Harry. "( We are, and," said Christian, " as there is a jeal- ousy existing among the island chiefs, which extends to- wards us, our capture would be almost certain." "Our wives could conceal us," said Harry. ' "But when the chiefs," observed Christian, "who are enemies to our wives, shall join the English in search. ing, ,we shall be discovered and taken." "Toono," said Harry, " knows of places of conceal-   "2    /- LIEUTENANT COLBORN, ment that are so perfectly secret that I never shall be found." "I hope you may be so fortunate," said Christian, and you may well suppose that I shall exert myself with my utmost ability for the same purpose." "And all of us," said the others. "Our arms and ammunition are as good as ever," re- marked Torquil, " can we not defend ourselves?-we would be assisted by the natives." "I think we should use our weapons only as a last resort," said Harry, " and even then, I do not think we can beat them off, although we should be assisted by the natives; but I must go, so I'll throw up my hand. Call and see us, and don't be strangers," and he bound- ed back to his cabin. "It is singular," said Christian, " that Harry will never leave Toono long enough to play a game at cards: how uneasy he was to get away, and would not remain to finish the game." "Hie loves her dearly," said another, " and his love is returned." "I do not think any of us can complain, for our wives are very affectionate," said Stew art. They were here interrupted by a cry of ,c Sail, ho!" from a native; and the cry was echoed from hut to h ut. They jumped from the cabin, leaving the cards scat- tered on the mat. "Whepe is she?" they cried, as they rushed to the landing. ' She is seen from yonder hill," was the reply, and on they ran through the forests. H-arry and Toono were already there. A tall ship was descried from the hill sailing towards the island. They watched her approach with restless anxiety.   OR THE DISINIIERITED.     113 "She is a frigate," said Harry mournfully. "' She is not," said Christian, "or I'm no seaman; but a large merchantman, bound in here for supplies." "I think so, too," said Haywood. "' I hope you are correct, my friends," said Torquil, "in pronouncing her a merchantman, but I fear she is a man-of-war,--to me she appears like one of that class of ships." I aml of your opinion," joined Harry, " for we hlave never seen a merchant ship at this island half so larg'e." Tlhe ship now came near -the island, and bearing away along the coas', exposed her side to view. As great numbers of men were seen on deck, and in the tops, it was decided at once that she really was a ship-of-war. She saled along' the coast, until reaching the harbor of Blabadae,whlere she reduced her canvas and entered. Having  conme to and anchored, hundrclleds of canoes surrounded her. She proved to lbe the Race Horse. Her commander having linded in a friendly manner, re- quested to hold an interview with the king and his principal chiefs. His request having been granted, he madeC known to them  that his object in coming to the island was to arrest the mutineers of the ill-fated Boun- ty for the purpose of carrying them to England. "It has been reported," continued the commander, "that they are living on this island, and as fa friendly relation exists between your people and my country- men, I respectfully demand their surrender." Those of the ctiefs whose daughters had become wives of the mutineers, exchanged meaning glances, and when the commander had fully made known his commission, they testified their disapprobation of his object. A  dispulte hereupon arose among the chiefs. Several wanted the mutineers surrendered immediatly; , 6*        *   "4      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, but by far the greater portion were bitterly opposed to such proceedings. The king was inclined to takie the part of the muti- neers, and he gave instructions to the interpreter to say to the commander, that, under the existing circumstan- ces, he did not think he was under obligations to make many of the daughters of his most powerful chiefs and people wretched, by complying with such demands. "I have peremptory orders from my government," re- turned the commander, " and must therefore take steps to execute them ;" and as he spoke, he assumed an ar- rogant air, and bowing stiffly, left the assembled chiefs and returned to the frigate. Mild means were first used to obtain possession of the persons of the mutineers, but without effect, as their wives had powerful friends among the natives. The frigate's boats manned with armed men, were now sent to the shore for the purpose of capturing the muti- neers by force.         -    - The sun shone upon the rich uniforms, the brightly polished side-arms of the soldiers, and the bristling bay- onets of the marinet, as they disembarked in military order, filling the nai st with fear and astonishment. "They come! they come! shrieked Toono, and with a determined voice, calling upon her husband to follow ^ her, she rushed from the houses and entered the forest% turning her head first on one- side, then on the other; searching with her dark eyes every space, path, hill, cavity, plain, hollow, tree, and thicket, as if she feared to see the crew of the frigate start from every place that offered concealnent, and tear her heart's dearest object from her forever. Danger to her partner, hatred to his pursuers, and the spirit of revenge had thorough- ly aroused the haughty passions in her heart, and her 4f   OR THE DISINHERITED.      l5 rich blood flashed through her veins, mounting to her pretty face so profusely as to show crimson through her nut-brown complexion, and gave her a degree of energy, alertness, and -activity she never before had shown. She ran so fast that Harry could, with the greatest difficulty, keep pace with her. On they proceeded through forests and across the plain, and ascended the hill that overlooked the distant harbor and tall frigate. They looked in vain for their pursuers, but the sound of discharging musketry told plainly that a fight was going on between the boats' crews and his comradeS. "' Foolish, stupid men!" cried Harry, "' to resist, when they must know that resistance is certain ruin, and that their only chance is concealment." "Come on now," cried Toono, ( "when we arrive at our journey's end you can have rest enough; and plant- ing upon his pale lips a kiss, she bounded off again, while he, exerting every nerve, followed after her. She having turned a hill, descended a dark cavity, several hundred feet, until she came to a place where it branched off into several passages. She took his hand, and penetrated its inmost recesses. At last they fell on their hands and knees, crept through a narrow gallery, and came out into a spacious room, formed by nature as it were, for a place of concealment. Toono lighted a taper, and a comfortable scene was displayed. The floor had been matted and adjusted by Toono's own hands. Yams, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other kinds of food, were stowed in the rooms in abundance, and a large vessel containing water stood beside them. The arms and ammunition that Harry had brought from the Bounty, with other articles, completed the useful furnishing of that deep, dark cave.   "6      IJEUTENANT COLBORN, "Now, dear Harry," said Toono, joyfully, "you are safe; they cannot find you here. But I must return and bring our boy, then for three long months we may not see the light of day; for let our enemies search, they will but search in vain. Should I not come back soon, do not fear; but remain here quietly." She clasped him fondly -to her throbbing heart; planted one long, linger- ing kiss upon his lips, and left him. She hurried back towards her cabin after her child; but on nearing it, saw with alarm several armed Englishmen loitering about the door, and others farther on among the ba- nana trees that waved their tops far above its lowly roof. Pearing far the safety of her child, she rushed to the door, but as she. was about to enter, she was recognized and seized by the guards, who she was told had orders to convey her on board the frigate, unless she would dis- close the hiding place of her husband. "Come, pretty one, where's your husband?" demand- ed an officer of marines in a gruff tone. "Why do you seize the person of a princess of this island? Where is my child?" demanded she. "I know all about you," said the officer,'" your coun- trymen have informed us." Toono gave a deep-drawn sigh at this sad intelli- gence. "We arrest you," continued the officer, 6 to compel you to disclose the hiding place of your husband. As for your child, it is in the hut there," and calling to one inside, the child was brought out to its mother. As she took the boy in her arms, and kissed him, a certain air of satisfaction appeared to be manifest in her beautiful features; and turning to the officer, she asked in'a determined manner, if she was at liberty to go. "Not by any means," answered the officer, who pos- \           .         . .    OR THE DISINHERITED.     117 sessed all the brutality of a new-made policeman, " you are our prisoner, and must continue to be so, until you direct us to your husband; but the moment you do that, you shall be set at liberty." "You have no right to make me a prisoner,"  said Toono, " and I repeat that you must instantly set me at liberty, or my countrytmen  will avenge the insult." "( Come along!" said the officer, "come, my pretty princess, you must go with us, unless you instantly agree to disclose the place of your husband's conceal- ment. Will you do it?" "I will not," she cried. "Do what you will; enact all the cruelties you can; but 'llll not betray the hiding place of him I love." "Come along,- then!" and they forced her from her home, through the forests, towards the water, while hund- reds of cowardly Kanakas looked on, but refused to listen to her cries for assistance, having become intimi- dated by the sound of their fire-arms. bne was dragged to the boat with others that were wives of mutineers, and conveyed on board the frigate. As these poor creatures appeared alongside the ship, the officers and crew gazed at them from over the rails, or through open ports; and when they ascended the deck, they becarme frightened by being in the presence of so many men, and strangers too; and also at the sight of the large guns that composed the batteries of the Race Horse's upper gun deck, and began to cry, and begged to be allowed to return to the shore. The first lieutenant having scanned them, walked away, not wishing to fur- ther witness such an affecting scene. They were conducted below, and confined under guard; having been told that unless they were willing to disclose- the places of concealment of their husbands,   "8      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, they were to be conveyed to England in the ship, and there to be tortured. The commander of the guard was a brute just fitted for his position, and seemed to take a pride in holding; in confinement these poor women; although it would have been difficult for any person to prove aught crim- inal against them, unless it be a crime for a wife to love and defend her husband. "Are you willing," said the officer in a rough voice, " to disclose the hiding places of the mutineers of the Bounty, who it seems have the name of being a kind of husbands or lovers to you?'? A degree of scorn played over the lips of the virtuous females, but as yet none spoke. At length, Toono, touched to thinkl her virtue had been questioned by the brute, exclaimed in a sarcastic manner, "Sir! these Englishmen are our husbands by the laws of Otaheite, as well as by the laws of God; and if our marriage ties differ from those of your country, they are no less sa- cred. And you have no right thus to so insult us." But this had no effect upon the hardened mind of the officer, and he contrived to make tantalizing remarks, stating that they would be whipped and otherwise pun- ished at sea, and never allowed to return to Otaheite again. The cruel conduct of the brute so wounded the feel- ings of the poor women, that they burst into tears, and kneeling upon the deck, appealed in earnest orisons to their gods for protection. I can not here forbear making a few remarks upon the tyrannical and unjust manner with which the Brit- ish government is in the habit of treating weaker na- tions, apparently upon the principle that might makes right. Numerous instances in many parts of the world might be cited of this, either of which ought to be suf-, ficient to damn her to everlasting infamy, in the mind   OR THE DISINHERITED.      119 of every honorable man. India was taken upon the shallowest pretenses, and from the governorship of Lord Clive down to Canning, a course of continual plunder and extortion has been enacted. But a more recent instance- is in point, -I refer to the unjust theft of Oude; - the property of the citizens of which, excepting in six cases, was confiscated; and the king held in captivity at Calcutta, all, because they had committed the awful crime of defending their lives, homes, and property. For this they were pronounced rebels. Rebels! to whom? Why, to England! because they dared to defend their own. Self-defense and self-pres. ervation are among the first great laws of nature. All men have held, and still hold, to these rights. A nation, insulted and threatened, places itself at the earliest opportunity in a state of defense. A citizen possessing wealth will spend it all to de- fend himself and family from harm. The aged man, tottering upon the brink of the grave, his hair bleached with the ravages of time, his weakened frame supported by crutches, if attacked, will indignant- ly turn upon his assailant, and with his trembling hand, defend himself. The innocent child, whose time in this wicked world has been too limited to have any knowl- edge of vice-who seems as if possessing no power but to love and cry,--will if imposed upon, as sometimes happens when children are left together, do all it can to protect itself from harm. The beggar in rags, degraded even to the lowest depths of poverty and distress, will cast a look of de- fiance upon the man who injures him, and lift in anger his hand to defend his wretched life. There are none so rich, none so poor, none so civil-   120     - LIEUTENANT COLBORN, ized, and none so savage, but will -defend themselves; and no just laws will deprive them of the right of so doing. But England denies that right when it inter- feres with her grand schemes of plunder. Many of the principal Rajahs of India have been hanged by her on the old plea of'being rebellious to the crown, but the grand reason in each instance has plain- ly been to obtain their immense wealth. Thousands of their subjects in turn have been unceremoniously dragged from their homes and families, and shipped off to the Andaman Islands, many hundred miles from their country, there to remain, cruelly imprisoned for life; and all for having committed the heinous offense of defending their homes against foreign invasion! And what makes the matter still more unjust is that they ate treated thus in opposition to the laws of all civilized nations; for these laws demand the release of prisoners at the termination of hostilities. Englishmen talk of American slavery! Good Heaven! All the faults of every nation in existence can not begin to be half so unjust as England's heinous acts towards the poor natives of Hindostan. When Napoleon caused : the Engishmen captured while bearing arms against him in battle to be shot,' English historians termed the act murderous, and thuA sought to injure the name of their great but unfortunate enemy; well knowing that their generals were not equal to him in the field, nor their statesmen equAl to him in the cabinet. Yet the wholesa3e -butcheries of the- inhabitants of Delhi, Lucknow. and other provinces of India are cov- ered over and smoothed down with the pretense that they were rebels! Oh! the inconsistency of that great nation, that boasts of having liberated, civilized, and christianized the world!   OR THE DISINHERITED.     1t21 We Americans extend our hospitalities freely to the open-hearted Irishman; the peaceable German; the excitable Frenchman; and the revengeful Spaniard; giving our daughters, and taking theirs in marriage, thereby developing without doubt, the greatest people in existence. We share with them our suffrages; and they become good and patriotic Americans; casting to the four winds their droit d' ainesse.  But not so with :Englishmen; our exertions and generosity are uselessly thrown away, in endeavoring to fraternally connect them to ourselves and country, and unite them to us by business, marriage, religion, and other powerful ties; yet they love monarchy! yet they cry, God save the Queen!       .,   122      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER    XV. THE REGRET. Toono and the other prisoners were ushered on deck, on the day after the capture, into the presence of the captain and first lieutenant. At the sight of these two dignified personages, the hearts of the poor women sank within them, as they supposed they were to receive still greater insults than had been given them by the marine officer. They were not aware that there are many gentlemen, as well as brutes, and that the two before them were of the form- er class., "Lead that one forward!" said the captain, pointing to Christian's wife, " we will question her first." "Is Fletcher Christian your husband?" demanded the captain, in a kind manner. "He is," answered the woman, and burst into tears. "Is he on this island?" "That question I cannot answer," she replied. ", But you are my prisoner." "Not by right." "Will you not inform me by what means I may ob- tain possession of the mutineers?" "I can not," she answered, " for by so doing, I should bring destruction upon my husband." ) "Lead up, another; " and Toono was next placed before him. "By my fate!" exclaimed the first lieutenant, " the fellow who is her husband, has made a good selection."   OR THE DISINHERITED.      123 "Who is your husband?" demanded the captain. "Harry,"' she answered, " and your appearance here has disturbed our happiness." "I presume so," said the captain, smiling. "Which is certainly wrong, sir," said she. "Is your husband on this island?" Toono cast upon him a look of independence, and firmly, yet respectfully said: "If your wife were sought by enemies, would you be the means of her destruc- tion, by making known her place of concealment?" The captain and first lieutenant exchanged meaning glances, as much as to say--"A noble woman this." Toono's bright, black eyes were fixed intently on the captain; but she looked in vain for his ans'wer. Another and another were questioned, with no better effect. All were true to the love and faithfulness they had sworn to observe to their hidden husbands. "Conduct them below again," said the captain; " no information can be obtained from such true women." As she entered the dark room and heard the cross tones of the marine officer, the heart of Toono sank within her again, as she now came to the conclusion that they were to be separated from their husbands and country forever.- But a friend, one of no small influence, although a stranger, was nearer' than she knew. ( Captain," said the first lieutenant, "I do not think we shall ever obtain any information concerning the mutineers from these females." "I fear we shall not, sir," was the reply, " they seem determined to keep secret their places of concealment." "I am really touched to hear the poor things mourn," said Colborn, " and truly wish they were out of the ship."   124      -LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "We Iwill liberate them, then," said the captain-" it is no credit to ourselves, or to our flag, that harmless women are confined on board the frigate. Set them at liberty at once, sir, and see they are safely conveyed on shore." "Aye, aye, sir," pleasantly answered Colborn, and bowing to the commander, he hurried to give the neces- sary orders. "Thank fortune, they are free again," said Colborn to himself, as he watched the boat which conveyed the prisoners to the shore, receding from the ship. Harry had waited in anxious expectation for the ar- rival of his wife and child; but, as they did not come, he concluded she had been arrested, and therefore gave up all hopes of seeing her again for some time. In a lon6ly and dejected state of mind, he threw himself upon the matted floor, in the farther side of the cave, when suddenly a slight rustling attracted his attention, and Toono immediately sprang towards him, and em- bracing each other, they forgot, for the time, the dan- gers that hovered around them. But Toono had been watched by a well paid Kanaka who followed her, and saw her entering the cave. The traitor immediately repaired on board the frigate, and reported the same to the commahnder; and orders were issued to have in readiness a strong force on the following morning, to search the place pointed out. The expedition was placed in charge of, the second lieutenant; and as the place of concealment was so far from the frigate, it was deemed advisable to send a large force, particularly as several of the chiefs had already evinced a disposition to defend their rights against what they termed actual invasion, by force of arms. Accordingly a body of a hundred men, compris-   OR THEE DISINHERITED.     125 ing a division of soldiers and one of marines, were conveyed from the frigate' in three large boats. They proceeded along the west coast of the island for a con- siderable distance, and entered a small bay, to effect a safe landing, free from the surf that the continued swell of the ocean causes upon these shores. They disem- barked in safety, and following the traitorous guide, marched over the hills and through the forests until they reached the path that led to the entrance of the cave. Alas! for the unsulspeoting Harry and his wife! Bribery had triumphed over honor,- as it has often done, and the military tread of the band fell heavily upon the ears of the peaceable inmates of the cave. The entrance was soon reached and surrounded by the as- sailants. The guide, followed by half a dozen armed seamen, entered the dark passage, and, lighted by a lantern, they groped their way along. As their voices echoed and reverberated among the thousand galleries and chambers of the rocky cave, and as they felt the chill of the damp rocks, deep in the bowels of the earth, the  generous-hearted seamen half regretted having come to arrest one of their own class, and a country- man, too, who had been so unfortunate as to have to conceal himself in such a doleful and uncomfortable dungeon. But they had a duty to perform} and they followed on after the Kanaka. Harry, perfectly calm, sat waiting  their approach, a -loaded and cocked musket resting across a rock and against his shoulder, pointing directly to the entrance of the small passage that led from the main and larger space to the apart- ment he occupied, Toono stood beside him, holding a musket in readiness to pass to him the instant he should fire the first, and by his side was a cutlass, ready for use,   126      LIEUTENANT COLBORN,  "Some cowardly Kanaka," she cried, " has betrayed us, for none other would have found this cave." At this instant, the form of the guide groping along the passage became distinctly visible by the light he carried, and in him Toono recognized a bitter enemy. "It is as I thought," she cried, " he is the bitterest enemy of my father and our family." "Then take that," said Harry, as he pulled the trig- ger of the musket. The ball entered his brain, and the traitor fell lifeless before the man whose life he was so willing to sacri- fice. "Stand bacl!" cried the foremost sailor to his com- panion, " there's shooting going on here." "Never fear, shipmates and countrymen," cried H-ar- ry, "s I shall not fire on you, although I have guns and ammunition in abundance. Now that I have shot the Kanaka guide, I am satisfied." Toono, astonished to find that her husband would no longer resist, and having no idea of allowing him to be snatched away from her, suddenly placed her hand upon his shoulder, and in a low, but determined voice, said, "Follow me!" He turned, and obeying, they passed through a long, narrow, crooked passage. It was of sufficient height, but so narrow that they were obliged to pass sideways. After pushing on for some time they- reached a place scarcely three feet high. Toono immediately stooped down and entered, while he, holding'fast to her loose tappa dress, followed. After progressing for some time in this manner, they at length reached a more roomy passage, and proceeded more 'rapidly. On, on they hurried, when suddenly they emerged from the passage into a thick forest of cocoa-nut trees." They penetrated its thickest recesses,    and concealed themselves in an old uninhabited hut. Here Toono took from her bosom a package containing pulverized bark, which being mixed with water, became the color of her race. With this she stained him; then she powdered his hair; and having tied the habiliment of a native around his waist, walked off to view him. "I declare," she exclaimed, " the disguise is perfect; I would not know you myself from a Kanaka!" In a short time. many of the frigate's crew rushed through the forest, and passed them by, as they left the hut, but did not recognize him as a European. , Hav- ing reached the shore, the fugitives entered a canoe, and quietly proceeded to the islet of Eimeo - their old and often frequented pleasure spot -hoping to ensure    i that safety Otaheite refused to afford.    'i For the night they were safe, as no armed men or     I boats disturbed their slumbers, and using the ground     for a ibed, the branch of a tree for a pillow, and the    canopy of Heaven for a covering, they reposed in si- lenoe. But on the following day, two armed boats put    J off from the frigate, and making towards Eimeo, told plainly that no safety remained for them even there. The boat reached the islet. What was to be done? Toono looked around in silence. "Remain quiet," said she, at length, "I do not think they will know you in your disguise." They landed, and twenty armed seamen walked up the hill to where they sat. Harry gave a deep-drawn sigh, and whispered, "It's all up now, I shall be taken."  "Not yet," whispered Toono, " speak not a word in English, and you are safe." "Halloa! my little beauty," exclaimed the officer in Command, ' any of the mutineers on this islet?" "No, sir, I think not," replied she, "'for I see no place br their concealment." .   128      LIEUTENANT COLBORN,          - "We shall satisfy ourselves," remarked the officer, and the party moved on past them, while Harry trem- bled with fear, supposing they must recognize him, "I must be disguised most perfectly," said Harry, after the party had left. "I told you so before," said Toono. Harry's heart beat violently as they again approached; but they re-passed without disturbing him, and firing muskets into every hole and cavity of sufficient size to contain a man, returned to their boats, fully satisfied that no mutineers were on that islet, and after returning to the frigate, they so reported. On this little islet, Harry and Toono remained in comparativesafety for several weeks, although the search for him had been continued on the islands all that time. Meanwhile they had succeeded in finding or destroying all of Iarry's comrades, including Christian himself. At length, the commander of the frigate being well sat- isfied that his crew had annihilated all of the mutineers on the island of Otaheite, deemed it advisable to go to the Windward Islands, there to' continue the search, for unless he destroyed or arrested them all, he would not be fulfilling the orders' of his government. To the inexpressible relief of Toono and her husband, they saw the Race Horse get under way, and proceed to sea. "She's gone! she's gone away to England," cried Toono in transport, clinging to her husband, and weeping for very joy. ' Oh! that no one may ever be obliged to undergo the dreadful torments I have for the last four months suffered. But now let us go to our home, and again settle down in our former state of happiness." She smiled happy; and he caressed her fondly; and they forgot the many dangers that had so lately hovered around them. They leaped into the canoe, splashed the blue waters   I -  again with their paddles, and sped on towards their home at Otaheite. As they leaped on shore,--he the only one remaining of the mutineers, and she the only happy one of all their chosen partners, -they were joy- fully received'by their friends, and conducted in triumph to their cabin. "We have succeeded in killing nearly all of those in- human pirates," said North to the first lieutenant the night following their sailing from Otaheite, as the frigate was beating against the fresh trade wind. "I hope the work of blood is ended, then," calmly re- marked Colborn, ",for I am heartily disgusted with wit- nessing so much cruelty as the officers and crew of this ship have enacted since our arrival at these islands." "Cruelty!" exclaimed the haughty son of Lord North, ' I can not look upon it as an act of cruelty, to shoot-down cold-blooded pirates." "You are too fast," said the lieutenant, " in charging these unfortunate men with being cold-blooded pirates, To be a pirate, a man must be a murderer of the most cruel kind; but these men committed no murder. Their offense, it is true, was serious; they ought not to have taken the Bounty from the captain, and set him and his officers adrift in an open boat, on the wide ocean. B ut we have ha eard but one side of the dis- graceful affair; had that ship been commanded and conducted in all ways ais this one is, I do not believe that any mutiny would have taken place on board of her. Be assured that the discipline of that ship must have been very slack indeed, - otherwise the petty of- ficers and sailors would not have dared to bolt into the commander's room, and seize and bind him, and take away his ship. I don't wish to say aught against that 7  130      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, unfortunate officer; but I believe that had he been a determined man, and commanded his ship with that re- serve and dignity which his station demanded, the mu- tiny would not have taken place. And furthermore, no little ceinsure is attached to the Admiralty, for send- ing a ship on such an expedition without marines. Had they no soldiers in England. that they could not spare a few for that ship? I wish she had had some of them at that time, and the Race Horse less now. We are so lumbered up with them, and the hospital is so con- stantly filled with the sick, that I am really of opinion it would be much better for us to sail for home, or some other cold country at once. Here we are boxing about where unknown reefs exist, these seas never having been properly surveyed, and liable to strike and lose our lives, all for the sake of hunting a few poor d--ls, and taking them from their adopted homes to make them miserable, doing us or England no good." it I was not aware," said the midshipman, " that any acts of cruelty had been committed, but if any have, it must have been by your orders, for the principal orders came from you." "It is true that I issue the captain's, and all general orders, either directly or indirectly, to the under officers, as my duty compels me; but yet I have never given , any order upon my own responsibility, to treat the na- tives of these islands, or any fugitive Englishman, who may have been so weak-minded as to have committed a crime that forces him to seek an asylum here, with : cruelty." ( "Weak-minded? What should make them weak- minded more than other men?" "The attractions of the beautiful women of these  islands," replied Colborn. - -   OR THE DISINHERITED.     131 i Pshaw! beautiful women!" exclaimed North with     a sneer, I have heard much said of the beauty of Otaheite women, but have never seen anything of it."     Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Colborn, meaningly. u  Then you are anxious to leave these islands, and go home!" said North changing the subject. "Is it      really to escape witnessing any further cruelties, or are  you not desirous to visit Plymouth?" The lieutenant cast upon him a reproachful look, but answered, "You are a tease, George; but have you no  desire to return to England also?" "Of course I have; and the principal reason is, that I may' see your lovely sister, and hope before another    year expires to have that happy privilege." "But what if I should tell her about that little plump  Kanaka girl you have been sailing around with, for the last two months?"  The midshipman changed countenance, but recover-  ing himself, asked firmly what he meant, declaring he     did not understand him.                    ' Oh! do not pretend to turn it off! I know all about it. You think you have been very sly; that you have not been observed; but I am aware of most of the       transactions of my friend."    North, biting his lips turned away, repeating, "  that Walker! I'll choke him, when I go below!" "Oh! do not make a serious matter of it," said Col- born laughing, " for be, assured I shall never mention it by word or letter; I am no tattler."    North, struck with remorse at this manly forbear-  ance, extremely regretted having written to Melissa, concerning his friend's courtship. He saw that much   trouble could be made in the North family, but more     particularly with Melissa, if Colborn should be as apt a * -   132      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, tattler as he had been, and fearing he might learn of his ^ own littleness in this particular, became much annoyed, and turned the subject again. "How long will it take us to beat to the Windward Islands?" he inquired. "About a week, I presume," answered the first lieu- tenant. "Are we to anchor there?" "No! the ship is to be kept off and on." "Then I presume our stop there will be of short du- ration?' "I do not know; but if my wishes or judgment are taken in the matter, she would not go there at all." The frigate continued to beat to the eastward for more than a week, all the time plunging so heavily into a head sea, as to make it disagreeable for all on board. Having arrived at Chain Islands, and sent on shore the boats, it was ascertained that no mutineers were upon those islands; and the commander becoming convinced of this, after taking on board a good supply of stock and vegetables, kept away before the wind for Ulietea, an island far to the leeward of Otaheite. Having sailed for several days before the! fresh trade wind, they hove in sight of the island, and soon the tall ship rounded to under its lee, and dispatched a boat on shore; no mutineers had ever been there, or at least, I so it appeared from the representation of the natives. ! After having searched and carefully scrutinized all parts, but without effect, the frigate was. again put in  sea condition, and departed'             I "Another disagreeable beating time for us," ssaid Colborn peevishy, "' and if thee Race Horse were not a smart ship on the wind, she never would reach there, against this current."                t   OR THE DISINHERITED,'     138 "Where are we bound to?" asked North. "To Ofeaheite! to hunt for mutineers who are all dead," was the reply. "It is not known but that one or more of them have evaded us."  And if the surmise be true," said Colborn, " do you not think they have been sufficiently punished for their crime, in having been hunted and harassed for more than four months; obliged to live in frightful caves and holes in the earth, often suffering from hunger or thirst, and always with fear of capture?" "I do not," said North, " for every one of them ought to be shot down, or taken and hung, for the offense of mutiny." "Then you are of opinion that one should suffer cap- ital punishment for other crimes than murder?" "I am; for there are other crimes much worse than the deprivation of life." ' I do not think," said the lieutenant, " that a per- son ought to suffer capital punishment for any crime but willful murder; and as those men have not com- mitted murder, they ought not to be -forced to suffer death." "We are obliged to make examples of them, for the good of society," said the midshipman. "You appear  to be quite averse to remaining at these islands." And you," said Colborn, " on the contraryare very    i well satisfied to remain, and particularly at Otaheite."   i As the heads of Otaheite's tall peaks became again visible, far above the white fleecy clouds that hovered    i over them, the hearts of many on board beat lighter      at the thought of meeting again the pretty Kanakas whom they loved.  It must indeed have been pleasant     sailing towards that island paradise, whose summits     I   134      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, appeared far above the smooth, blue waters of the ocean. As she rounded the point, and stood for the anchorage ground, a cry of " the Race Horse has come again! the Race Horse! Race Horse!" rang like a funeral knell in the ears of Toono and her husband. They had been happy since her departure, and did not sup- pose they were again to be hunted. But alas! that hateful ship had returned, her boats were again manned, polished fire-arms and bristling bayonets, again filled thousands of Kanakas with fear, as the sailors and marines landed and marched up the eminence to the village they had so often before dis- turbed. -, r J      "   OR THE DISIINHERITED.     135 CHAPTER    -XVI. TIE IMPRISONMENT. "Follow me again, dear Harry," cried Toono, " for those armed men are again on the man hunt;" and leav- ing her child with her friends, they bounded over a stream, through a forest, and reached. the western shores of the island. "There they are!" cried Harry, as an armed boat was seen making around the point. She neared the shore; her crew leaped upon the beach, and pursued the last of the mutineers. Over hill and dale, through forests and thicket, Toono and Harry ran with an alertness that only a race for dear life could produce. "We outrun them, Harry," cried Toono, with hope. But the fugitives at length became so much fatigued that they were glad to enter a well-known cave to rest. 1Most fatal step! for several traitorous'Kanakas - who had joined in the pursuit - had seen them enter it, and they .pointed it out, or otherwise the approaching sail- ors would have passed it by. The pursuers entered the cave, and leveled their pis- tols upon the form of Harry, and demanded of him to surrender. Toono threw herself upon him to receive the bullets she already imagined were escaping from their firearms, and in anguish shrieked, "Oh! spare him! spare him! and let your anger fall on me."   136      LIEUTENiXNT OOLBODN, "Ve do not wish to injure you, pretty one, but we must have this mutineer,'? replied they. And laying hold of the unarmed Harry, they bade hiin go with them. \ "( Don't call me pretty one! bad men! cried Toono, in a rage, " when you have come to seize my husband." "Come along," said they to Harry, " and don't' hold back, for it will do no good." And they dragged hiin from the cave. ;' Oh!" sobbed Toono, "they have him at last!5" and continuing to cry and mourn most piteously, she .clung to him, and endeavored to hold him backo But those powerful men could not be held back by her weak hands, and in spite of her exertions they forced on Harry to- wards the boat. She begged to be taken with him, but to no purpose. She implored her countrymen to liber- ate her husband from their powerful grasp, but they feared the armed band. The sailors forced Harry into the boat, and leaving poor Toono on shore shrieking and mourning in a most piteous manner, conveyed him towards the frigate. "The boat's crew are coming alongside with a muti- neer," said North, to the first lieutenant. "Well, pass the order to the officer of the deck to receive the prisoner," said the first lieutenant, in a tone of regret, " and by and by tell me I have given this day a cruel order."  The prisoner was conducted on deck, and as his care-  worn and sorrowful countenance was observed by the first lieutenant, that kind-hearted man turned away in pity, regretting that the unfortunate prisoner had been I taken.                        oi The commander, wishing to question -Iarry, ordered  t him to be conducted into his presence.  ii   OR THE DISINHERITED.     137 "What is your name?" demanded the commander, of the disheartened and downcast prisoner. 'a Harry," he answered, without lifting his eyes from the deck. "What is your surname?" Harry did not answer the question. "s Perhaps he does not understand you, sir," observed the first lieutenant. What, then, is your last name?" asked the com- mander. "I'd rather not give it, sir,": was his reply. "Were you one of the crew of the ship Bounty, commanded by Captain Bligh, and taken from him by her crew?" "I was a boy on board of that ship, sir." "Then you acknowledlge that you were a mutineer?" "I do not, sir." "How so? Did you not participate in the mutiny?"  ' I was only a boy,"' replied the prisoner, " and was obliged to remain with the strongest party." "Are there others of your comrades still on this isl- and?"        . "I do not know, sir." "How many were there in all of you?" " I do not remember, sir." As the examination proceeded, the attention of the first lieutenant was taken by the very soft and singular expression of the prisoner's eyes. "I fancy," he said, mentally, i"I have seen this fellow before. I really am sorry for him. What eyes he has! Why should he remind me of her?" No information having been obtained of the prisoner, he was led below and placed in charge of the guard. On the following day the first lieutenant visited the 7*    138 8LIEUTENANT COLBORN,           ? island for curiosity and amusement. During his ab- sence a large canoe, containing several persons of im- portance, approached the frigate, and asked respectfully if they would be allowed to go on board. The officer of the deck roughly answered that there was no admittance. A tall and important-appearing man then arose in the canoe, and, addressing the officer, said that he was the father of her whose husband was then confined on board the ship as a prisoner, and that he had accompanied his daughter, hoping she might obtain an interview with her husband. He implored the officer that the request might be granted. "We wish- no weeping women on board," said the officer, "so go away from the frigate!" The canoe returned towards the shore, while poor Toono looked back and shed tears of grief to think he she loved was kept in cruel imprisonment. As they disembarked and ascended the hill towards the village, they observed the first lieutenant in earnest conversation with an old sailor, one of his boat's crew, who had left the boat without permission. '4Jack! you know this is not the first offense," said the lieutenant to the sailor. "I have let you off several times before, and if it occurs again, look out!" "Ye see, sir," said Jack, " that I, being in love with  one o' these gals up the hill, could'nt help running up ? for a minute to see her. And besides, I did'nt expect to meet Mr. Colborn on my way, and though I have, I  ? hope he'll overlook it, for 'fore now he's saved me many j: a flogging."                      t Colborn turned aside that the old tar should not see him smile, and asked, A Have .ot seeS liher?" "Ay, sir."               - ,: i *   OR THE DISINHERITED,      139 "And are now on the way to the boat?" "Ay, sir." "Then bear a hand! and see you do not repeat the offense.) "Ay, ay, sir! I'll be on board of her in a jiffy;" and Jack, touching his hat respectfully, disappeared in an instant. ' "Holloa, shipmates!" cried Jack, as he reached the boat, ' holloa! sunning yourselves on your thwarts now, like turtles on the shores of Cuba, eh?" "Ay," replied Bill, "' but the coxswain is to report you, so be ready for three dozen." "He's to report me to the first luffy, I 'spose!" "Ay, and as soon as he comes down, too." "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Jack. "You'll not laugh then," said Bill, " for sure you'll not." Il Ha! ha! Did you ever know me to be flogged yet?" asked Jack. The boat's crew looked from one to another, as they recollected that it had been said that no cat had ever touched him. "-But you'll get it this time, though," said Bill; a ha! ha! ha!" "Ha! ha! laugh away, but I'll get no flogging," re- plied Jack, and took his place on his thwart. The old chief and his party approached the first lieu- tenant just as the sailor left him. "' Father,'5 said Toono, " this is the officer next to the commander; he was very kind to us when we were on board the fiigate. We think we were released by his influence. Oh, I am so glad to see him, for I'm sure he will allow me to see mny husband." As Toono approached him quite near, her doleful countenance attracted his attention,   "O      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Kind sir!" said she, "I amn one of those wretched women you treated so kindly on board your ship when she was here before." Colborn acknowledged that he recognized her. "This is my father," said she, introducing him in her plain manner. As the lieutenant performed his part of the introduc- tion, he admired the intellectual and dignified bearing of her father, and inwardly confessed himself in the presence of a superior man. The prince immediately invited him to his home, and extended to him its hospitalities. "My daughter," said he, as they became seated on the mats in his neat cabin, "is in deep trouble because her husband is confined on board your ship as a prison- er. Knowing that your government has demanded the arrest of those who rose on the officers of the Bounty, and that the Race Horse has been sent here for the pur- pose of seizing them, I no longer censure the command- er, as I did at first. At that time, I opposed him with all my influence, and must still complain that the man- ner used to accomplish the purpose has not been at all just and honorable. With these more friendly senti. ments, I accompanied my daughter to the frigate, think-  ing she might have the privilege of seeing her husband. I hoped to have the privilege of conversing with the commander, but we were not allowed to go on board. We beg -to ask of your kind self the favor the officer on board would not grant."                i Colborn well knew that what the prince had said    concerning the unjust manner that had been used in   i capturing the mutineers was true, but he did not say   so, as his station did not admit of it.        ,; Y"Your request is cheerfully granted," said he, " and ? had I been on board you would have been admitted."      OR TIIE DISINHERITED.     141 "Oh, kind sir," said Toono, "I thank you; and if you have a loved one, may she never be torn from you to cause you the pain I now suffer." "Thank you, noble man," -said her father, " and 'may you and yours be blessed forever." The wish of Toono went directly to his heart, for he at once thought of Kate, and of the powerful obstacles he had to overcome before she could be his. Then, noticing that the bride of Harry appeared anx- ious to improve the permission granted, he bade them adieu, and as he walked down the hill towards the boat, he could not help pondering the strength of the affec- tion that rules in woman's heart when once that heart has chosen its partner; and as he stepped on board of. the frigate, he accosted the officer of the deck in a form- al manner, saying, a When those peaceable visitors that you have driven from alongside come again, have'the kindness to admit them on board." Ere long the prince and Toono awere announced, and welcomed on board by the first lieutenant, Toono was conducted to her husband down on the lower gun deck, and with her heart's idol had an inter- view of an hour, during which time they conversed in the Kanaka tongue. The commander also granted the prince an interview, in which the 'latter asked as a boon that Harry might be released. He persistently urged that Harry was but a boy on board the Bounty,- and could not have been accessory to the mutiny. But this did not convince the commander, and being determined to convey him to England for trial, he refused to grant the request. The time allotted for Toono's interview expired, and she was obliged to leave the prisoner. As she passed the first lieutenant, she implored him to allow her daily   "2      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, visits to her husband, andc that he would not allow him to be mistreated by the, l".:rd. Colborn' consoled her bt granting her request, and she become more tranquil; and descending the ladder to the canoe, she proceeded with her father on shore. The commander being satisfied that no other muti- neers remained on the islands, gave orders to his officers to get the ship in readiness to depart for .England. New life now seemed to be infused into the minds of the ship's company, and Old England, and wives and sweethearts, were spoken of in every mess, although doubtless a few would have been perfectly contented to remain at Otaheite. As the sailing day approached, Harry and his faith- ful wife, dwelling upon the prospect that they must soon be separated forever, became indeed wretched. But they had decided upon making an effort to thwart the commander of the Race Horse in his intention of con- veying his prisoner to England. His place of imprisonment was between two of the forward guns on the lower gun-deck, where he was guarded by two sentinels. Besides this, his wrists were confined by irons; but, fortunately for him, his ankles were not shackled. He had instructed Toono to lay near the frigate at night with the canoe, so that in case he should leap through a port into the water, she could rescue him. But night after night passed by, and no opportunity of- : fered to encourage an attempt at escape. He began to think his plans would prove hopeless, and he be car- ried to England, when (on the very night before the day appointed for the frigate's departure) the propi- tious moment arrived. The ship's company were asleep in their hammocks, and a comparative silence reigned   OR THE DISINHERITED.      143 throughout the ship. One of his guards had fallen asleep, and the other leaned over a gun carriage, forget- ting that he was placed there to watch a prisoner. At this critical moment Harry, trusting to the watch- fulness of Toono, silently crowded through the port and dropped into the water. The faithful Toono heard the splash as he struck the water, and immediately as- sisted him into the canoe. The sentinel also hearing a noise under the port, awaked, and missing the prison- er, gave the alarm; and soon it was known fore and aft that the mutineer had escaped. As soon as practicable, a boat was manned, and pur- suit commenced; but it being dark, and the boat's crew having no idea as to which direction the fugitive had /taken, did not succeed in recapturing him. The fugitive having reached the shore, repaired to the ,cabin of Toono's father, and here Harry found means to relieve his wrists of the handcuffs. They did not venture to remain here long, as it was well known that search would be nmae at the house of the prince; but they dared not risk to occupy either of the caves, often before resorted to in times of danger, as these had become quite well known to the crew of the frigate; but concluded to trust themselves to the forests on the western part of the island, and accord- ingly ere the break of day they were on their way thither.                '    '-   "4      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER    XVII. THE CANNONADE.      / "What's that I see?" asked Harry, as they ascended a hill that from its summit commanded a view of the village and harbor. "A boat from the firigate," replied Toono, " and mal- ing this way." "I did not think," said her husband, " they would be- gin the hunt so soon; but I might have known they would, as they do not wish to let me live." "The kind lieutenant would .have let you rest; had the matter been left with him," said Toono. "But come! we must not dally here; come! let us turn to the right and hurry on." "To the right!" cried Htarry, as lie saw a band of sailors making towards them from that direction. "Look there!" Toono looked bewildered. Pursuers were coming both by land and by water. No time was to be lost, and as the boats had not yet rounded the point, and were much farther off than the other party, she decided to take the chances on the water. "This is our only chance," she cried; and they de- scended the hill, leaped into a canoe, and paddled off towards Eimeo. They had not gone far when the boat which had been seen from the hill rounded the point, and gave them chase. She was manned with powerful men, who, grasping their bending oars, forced her ^ .   OR THE DISINHERITED.     145 through the water at great speed, and there was soon no doubt that the fugitives would be overtakeno Still Tlarry and Toono plied their paddles in the unequal race for dear life, and made their light canoe almost fly over the surface of the water. The pinnace gained on them, however, in spite of their great exertions. Presently the top of a rqgged, barren rock came into view, as the canoe turned a point of land. It was not far from the shore, yet the water all around was almost fathomless, and many feet it reared its peaked head above the sea, worn and'bleached by the perpetual washing of the ocen's billows. "Don't give np yet, dear Ha-rry," cried the energetic Toorno, " for if we can reach that rock, perhaps we will escape." And although the perspiration rolled down her face and neek, and off her shoulders, she seemed almost en- dued with superhuman strength. Harry also still wield- ed his paddle with almost herculean power, the fear of being taken stimulating hiln to stupendous exertions. "Level on ttema!" cried the officer of marines, as the pinnace came almost in contact with the canoe. At this instant Toono, dropping her paddle, cried, "Leap after me, Harry!" and they' both plunged be- neath the sea; at the same moment the explosion of half a dozen muskets rent the air. When the smoke cleared away, the frail canoe, shattered and splintered, with the two paddles floating on the agitated surface of the water, were all that remained to be seen of the fu- gitives. Down, down she swam - and close to her feet, which he could distinctly see in the clear water- followed her dear Harry. They plunged through a cavity wrought by the constant washing of the sea, and ascending again   "6      LIEUTENANT COLBOR, above the water's surface, were perfectly concealed within that hollow rock. "We were just one second to6 late," said the officer in command. "They both struck the water as we fired; so load up, marines! and give way, sailors!" The boat moved on, and the marines having reloaded, were in readiness to fire as soon as the want of air should force the fugitives to rise again. All eyes were now cast over the place where the fu- gitives had disappeared. "Rather long-winded," said an old shell, rolling his quid of tobacco from one cheek to the other. ' We have shot them," said the lieutenant of marines to the commander of the boat, "for no human being could exist alive so long under the water." "' No, sir! they are not shot," said the officer in com- mand, " for they were under water ere the muskets ex- ploded." "That's my opinion, too," observed midshipman North, "for I watched them as they leaped." "But where are they?" asked the lieutenant of ma- rines, as, in a careless way, he seated himself, smiling as if well satisfied that the -muskets had done the in- tended work. "(Can they respire water?" The commander of the boat did not answer, but east a perplexed look over the water. "I should'nt like to have as many bullet-holes in my body as they have," whispered a marine 'to one of his comrades. "Nor I," rejoined the party addressed. "What are you talking about?" said a sailor; how do ye know whether they are shot or not, seeing that you always shut your eyes when you pull the trigger?"   o0 THE DISINHERITED.     147 'Tis false!" said the marine, in a loud and indig- nant tone. Let us have less noise in the bows of the boat, there," cried he in command, " and give way!" " The oars dropped simultaneously into the water, and with a quick pull the pinnace moved towards the rock. "Ease the port oars! pull away starboard!" said the bfficer in command; and the boat, assisted by the helm, swept around the rock most beautifully. Having carefully examined all parts of it without succeeding in finding any place of concealment, the opinions of those who had held that the fugitives had not been shot began to waver, and in a short time all declared tlat the mutineer and his wife were no more. "It is stupid to think they are not dead," said the of- ficer in command, , so I will make out the report for the ship accordingly, and go immediately on board. Now, men, I congratulate you all for this day's success. Give way P" The order was obeyed, and the oars fell into the wa- ter, ruffling its polished surface. The boat moved for- ward, and the hearts of the two hidden beings - nearer than was known - beat light as they heard the dash of the oars. They thought themselves again free, and all wet as they were, they embraced, and from their damp cave thanked God for their delivery. But, alas! they were doomed to disappointment, for the eyes of midshipman North, penetrating several fathoms under water, saw the cavity in the rock. "Hold!" cried he. "Lookthere!" ' Heave up!" said the officer, and asked North what he saw. "A hole in that rock, four fathoms under water," was the reply.   "8      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Stern-all!" commanded the officer; and soon the pinnace was backed close to the side of the rock. "I can see no cavity there," said one. "Nor I." ( Nor I," said others. "Wait a little," said North, (' until the water becomes again smooth." "We'll have to wait some time," grumbled an old sailor, who sat pretty well forward, and who had been quite annoyed at being obliged to return to the rock. ' Why so?" said another, " don't you think the mid- dy has seen anything?" -"Seen anything! How the d--1 can a man see any- thing four fathoms under water?"  "Sure enough! better go on board than be humbug- ging around this rock." "There it is!" cried North, pointing down the water near the rock. "Yes, I see it,' said the officer, " but what of it, after all." "I think the fugitives are in that hole," said North. ,c Ah! ha! there's where they are - I see through it all now! That rock is hollow, and they having swam through the hole, have ascended. above the water in- side." "Exactly," said the midshipman. ' Is there any man among you who is willing to dive down and examine that cavity?" asked the commander of the pinnace. No answer returned. "Is there no man here," continued he, " no seaman, who is willing to brave a dive to serve his king and country?" i But that's a deep dive, sir!" said an old seaman, as he measured the distance down with his experienced eye; " and besides, I would'nt like to poke my head amongst the sharp-looking rocks down there."   OR THE DISINHERITED.    149  "I say so, too,'" said another; " and although I should like to do my king and my country a favor, I can't - down there." None would venture. "Are there none amongst you all," said the officer, "brave enough to make the dive? Is there no officer here who will venture? I declare, I shall be ashamed to report the same to the captain." North, stung with the taunt, and particularly as he imagined that several looked sharply at him, now de- clared he 'would tfry it. He stripped off his upper gar- ments, and stepping one foot on the gunwale, was about to plunge, when the cry of "A shark! a shark!" ar- rested him; and an enormous shark passed leisurely by the rock, just beneath the surface. As North saw the finny monster look at the boat,- as if wishing some one would leap or fall overboard, to serve him for a meal,-he turned pale, and fell back into the boat. "Serves him right," whispered an old sailor. "What right has he to think he can do what we can't? The upstart!" u' How can we capture them,9' asked the officer, " if no one will go down?"  Would you have a man dive amongst sharks?" asked a petty officer. "Are you satisfied they are in the rock?" asked the commander, turning to the officer of marines. "I am," was his reply. x And what plan do you think can be adopted to get at them?" "I know of none but to watch them until hunger forces them to come out." "It is possible, and even probable, that they may have   150      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, provisions inside that rock. If so, our watching would be in vain." a Why don't they leave the poor devils to the sharks?" whispered a sailor. "Sure enough," said another. "I know of no better plan than to blow up the rock with gunpowder," said the commander. "Oh! cruelty!" whispered the sailor. "Oh! the wretch!" whispered another. "That's it!" exclaimed the officers. 'That is the best plan of all."          , "Then I'll make out the report accordingly," said the boat's commander. "We can do no more good here now, so we will go on board. Give way!"' The pinnace dashed forward, and rounding the point of land, the rock was lost to view. On the following day the frigate got underway, and sailed around the western side of the island. As the rugged peak of the rock hove in view from the ship, the courses were hauled up, and all hands beat to quarters. The first and second divisions, main deck, were or- dered to load and level upon it. The frigate soon reached quite near to the rock. .The order was given to fire, and the booming of cannon sounded and resounded over the rocks and shores for many miles. The firing was continued some fifteen minutes, and as soon as the smoke ascended, all looked for the rock; but in vain, for the heavy cannon balls had crushed its hollow walls, and hurled it, and all it contained, beneath the sea. Nothing could be seen where it so lately had stood but the flowing waters of the great Pacific. The frigate now returned to her anchorage. All on board were satisfied that the last of the mutineers had   OR THE DISINHERITED.     151 been destroyed, and thus that society would be satisfied, and those who had been injured, revenged. After a few weeks spent in recruiting and refitting, the frigate got underway and put to sea. As she moved from the island, never more to return, thousands of Kanakas rejoiced at her departure - and none more so than did the lovers, who had escaped from the rock ere the frigate reached it. Joyfully they rushed through the forests and down the hills to their long-deserted cabin. They were met by hosts of their friends, who rent the air with their wild and enthusiastic shouts, con- gratulating each other on the escape and deliverance of the last of the mutineers, Harry--and his loving wife, the heroic and ever-faithful Toono. /        152      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, OCHAPTERL    XVIII. THE REFUSALE Once more let us turn to consider the fortunes of Fellows, the robber chief. Having met with uncom- monly good success by the specie robbery on board of. the merchantman at sea; and having run so many hair- breadth escapes of late, itpcannot be a matter of surprise that he should wish to abandon a life so full of danger, and embrace one of safety. He made up his mind, that if possible, he would become a respectable citizen, and he looked for a propitious result in the attachment he had formed for the bar-maid at Plymouth, as in part a means towards this end. At the same time the intima-y cy he had formed with good people at the inn, had no small share in causing him to form this good resolution. Accordingly he made a settlement with his companions satisfactorily to them all, Hubert, who was anxious to get his place, assisting much in accomplishing it. Hu- bert indeed was willing to accept of the more cumbrous articles for his share, leaving Fellows' portion-- with the exception of the brigantine - all in cash and jew- els, which constituted a large sum. Fellows bade his former companions a last adieu, and made his home with his mother,- a very respecta- ble widow lady living up town. She was ignorant of her son's manner of life, as he, when at home, told her artful stories to make himself appear like an honorable young man. He set up an establishment, kept a splen-   OR THE DISINHERITED.     153 did carriage and pair; dressed tastefully and fashiona- bly, and by his superior appearance, and the influence of lhis mother, he might have formed an alliance with a lady of respectability and family, from among the many into whose society he was thrown. But neither of these London fair ones had the fortune, or rather mis- fortune, to make an impression on his heart, which still turned towards the lovely bar-maid of Plymouth. And at length having enjoyed the pleasures of London to his entire satisfaction, he resolved to visit Plymouth to be again in the presence of her he loved, and also to do his utmost to win her heart and hand. Another mission, but of less consequence, which he intended to perform, was to venture to the wood near Winchester, with the object of rescuing firom the tree the treasures he had been obliged to leave concealed within its trunk. Captain Harvey was accordingly instructed to get the vessel in readiness for sea, as Fellows dared not travel through portions of the country he had so many times disturbed by robbery. Having bid his mother an affectionate farewell, and told her he was going on a journey to France on business, he repaired on board his yacht, and she soon after got underway. The weather was pleasant, and after the Nancy had dropped down the stream with the ebb tide until clear of the forest of shipping, that at nearly all times blocks up the harbor of London for several miles below Black- wall-the white canvas was spread to the westerly breeze, and she slipped along the smooth waters of the river as gracefully as a swan, and but for the rippling under her bows, and the bubbling wake astern, none would have supposed she was making the half of the 8   154      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, ten knots an hour, which was her actual speed. The crew seemed over anxious to show off before their corn- modore, as they called Fellows. In fact, he had be- come an idol with all on board, as he was kind in his bearing towards them, and gave them money and a double share of grog, and they fancied they had less work to do when he was on board, and better times generally than during his absence. The commander and owner of the Nancy could truly say that he was lord of all he surveyed, and as he and Harvey walked the quarter deck in friendly con- versation, 'he probably thought so. They occasionally espied a well-known house, hill, windmill, or other ob- ject on the shore, about which one or the other had some remark to make. Now and the t the mnagnifying powers of the glasses discovered a distant wood, which was fraught with unpleasant reminiscences to the mind of Fellows.  There had been for years a connection be- tween the forests and himself, and as he thought of the many dangers he had passed amongst them, and how much he had risked for money, he shuddered. But he was not the only one who had been a thief, cheat, and robber for the root of all evil. No! there are others who, under the cloak of relig- ion and respectability, ruined their once honest names in this world, and damned their souls forever in the next, and all for gold ---that slave of the dark and dirty mine! They sailed on down the river, passed through the Downs, and around the Forelands to Dungeness, when they found the wind blowing right up channel. "There's no doubt about the wind's being ahead now," said Harvey. Fellows looked at the compasses to see if it were in- deed true.   OR THE DISINH-ERITED,     155 It's so, sir," continued the captain, " although you seemed to think otherwise coming down the river. - But I thought, and still think, our jibs will fill for some time," and he'looked to windward with an air of con- fidence. "The wind at Margate was W. N. W. and some- times N. W. by the compass," said Fellows, " and I said that it would be a good wind for us in the channel, but now I see that it is W. S. W., so of course the wind has changed four points." 'No! I am sure the wind has not changed," said Harvey, " for many times I have experienced it quite different in the river from what I have found it in the channel; and as a proof that I am correct, if we should return to the river, we would still find the wind as be- fore. " "I will not dispute with you," said Fellows, " as you are experienced in these matters, and I am not. But how long will it take us to go down the channel with such an unfavorable wind?" "Nearly a week, but as we have the chance of a shift of wind meantime, we may reach our port of des- " tination sooner.'" ' Let us proceed, then," said Fellows. The yards were immediately braced sharp up; all her fore and aft sheets hauled off; bowlines hauled out; and the little craft put in complete beating - or as the coasters say, turning order. "This leaping and plunging is very disagreeable," said Fellows, as, lying on the counter in the cabin, he shifted from side to side every time the vessel went in stays. "It is," replied Harvey, "but we must put up with such circumstances sometimes."   156      1 LIEUTENANT COLBORN, The brigantine worked around the Ness by short tacks and a fresh breeze, when, reaching out into the channel way, she met the sea so high that they were obliged to take in the light sails. "I am getting sea-sick," cried Fellows, " by this con- founded pitching, which is worse than jolting in a stage coach, on a bad road after a heavy rain." "You ought to be free from that disagreeable feel- ing by this time," said Harvey, "for you have been considerably accustomed to the sea." "But she never jumped so much as this before," said Fellows. "Put her back into smooth water, Harvey I! for this is too bad." "Where shall we go?"  "Oh! anywhere.  In the Downs I think will be safe and comfortable." In a short time the vessel assumed a different motion, for having fallen off from the head sea, she was running before it' quite steadily. She rounded the North Fore- land, and anchored in smooth water. "There!" exclaimed Fellows with joy, " we will re- main here until there is a change in wind and weather. I declare I never before suffered so much with sea-sick- ness." "Sea-sickness is indeed a disagreeable sensation," said Harvey,- " well I remember the agonies I exper- ienced from it, when I commenced my career as a sail- or." "It is the most unpleasant feeling I ever yet exper- ienced," joined Fellows, "'excepting that caused by a death sentence." "To   change the subject," said Harvey, "we will not lose by seeking anchorage here, perhaps, as there are many French cruisers in the channel, and of course   OR THE DISINHERITED.     157 with a fair wind we will run less risk than with an un- fair one, for with .the former we can at all times keep within close reach of the English shore; but with the latter we must stand out into the channel to a consider- able distance, otherwise we could accomplish nothing by our tacks." "What would be the consequence if we were taken by a French cruiser?" asked Fellows. "' Imprisonment in France until the close of the war, and there is no telling when the war will terminate. But without regard to the war's end, our chance of re- lease to enjoy this life would be very slim in one of those deuced prisons, for they are densely crowded, and much sickness and many deaths occur within their walls." "And the brigantine would be confiscated to the government," said Fellows, " but I would not care that for her loss," continued he, snapping his finger, "6 for I could easily buy another, and one, too, that would not make me sea-sick, nor be out-sailed by every vessel-of- war in the channel." The captain did not like this last remark, as he was proud of the vessel he commanded, and especially had a high opinion of her sailing qualities, notwithstanding that she had been beaten by a frigate. He was well convinced that the cause of her being out-sailed in the instance referred to was to be attributed to the superior size of the frigate, and particularly to her length, rather than to any superiority in model. He therefore assert- ed to Fellows, that it was very easy to purchase another vessel, but would be not so easy to find another Nancy. "' I do not have as high opinion of her as you seem to have," said Fellows,--" she came near losing my life   158      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, for lack of better sailing qualities, and now to-day has plunged so furiously that she has made me sea-sick as a dog." The captain laughed heartily at this last cause of complaint, as persons not used to the sea are liable to be sick on board of any craft of the size of the Nancy  t in rough weather. On the following morning, the wind having changed to the northeast, the N'ancy got underway and sailed before. a favorable breeze on her destined track down the channel. She kept close to the English coast all the way to avoid the enemy's cruisers, and, having a fresh breeze, made the run to the entrance of Plymouth harbor in a little more than twenty hours. As he gave orders to have the studdingsails doused, gear unrove, booms rigged in, light sails furled, and other preparations made to enter port, Harvey said goodnaturedly to Fellows, "The Nancy can't sail any, eh! She has only passed twenty-two  vessels coming down channel, and some of them fast-looking crafts, too." "Do not mention it, I beg of you," said Fellors.   i t'We have, it is true, out-sailed a few slow old tubs, but had a  man-of-war or any other good sailing craft been on our course, we would have been beaten."        i "We   cannot expect to sail with large frigates," said 'I Harvey, "particularly in strong breezes."  "What is the good of a   vessel to us, then," cried Fellows, " if she can not out-sail ships of war?  We surely do not stand in fear of merchantmen! But I'll say no more, as I do not intend to risk myself in this yay much longer." "You are really severe," said Harvey, "to condemn four own Nancy. With your permission, I  will risk ny life in her some time yet."              f   OR THE DISINHERITED.     159 "I do not say that the vessel does not sail at all," said Fellows, " but, there are others, I am sure, that are much faster." The brigantine entered the harbor, and, having sailed through the anchored shipping, came to, near the town. Fellows pointed his glass up Pell street, and as it rest- ed on the sloping front of the inn, a hundred pleasant and happy emotions filled his bosom. The boat was quickly manned, and he was set ashore, and walking up the street, entered the inn. "Mr. Carey's come," said Rose, a trusty servant- maid, who had been in the family for years. "Indeed!" calmly remarked Kate. "Are you not glad he has returned?" inquired Rose. "He is so gentlemanly, and then he gave me a pound for my attention to him, when he left." "It is customary for gentlemen to give the servants money, when leaving an inn," observed Kate. a But from all who have lodged here," said she, " I have only received a trifling amount excepting from him. But here he comeswith master! I'll run to the kitchen," and away she bounded, while Kate entered the parlor. Blor. Pederson conducted Fellows to the parlor, and as the latter extended his hand to the lovely Kate, he regretted that circumstances had not made him ac- quainted with her before any one else had laid claim to her affections. But he became all the more determined to, win her for himself. He became seated, and looking' at her affectionately, remarked to Mr. Pederson that he was highly pleased to see them lookingl so well; and asked if they had both enjoyed good health during his absence. u' We have" kindly answered Mr. Peclerson.   160      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "You,9 she continued, " have been staying princi- pally at London, I presume.' "I have." ' How did you find your mother, of whom I have heard you speak? , asked Kate. "Quite well, I thank you, in fact, I have never known her enjoying better health." "I am happy to see that you are pleased enough with Plymouth to visit it again," said Mr. Pederson. "I am well pleased with Plymouth, but much more so with my friends resident here," casting a loolk at Kate. "I am glad to hear you say so," said Mr. Pederson, ( and I can assure you that we are as well pleased with yourself." Fellows thanked him gracefully, and looking at them both, said smrilingly- "I intend remaining a few weeks at Plymouth, and it remains with you and your amiable daughter wheth- er I shall stop here at the inn or not." The old man had harbored aCfancy for his guest from their first acquaintance, and now said, "My dear Mr. Carey, while I have a home, you shall always be wel- come within its walls,- we place our accommodations at your disposal. Come land welcome, and be assured that my dutiful daughter will agree with me. Will you not, Kate?" "Yes, father, I am always willing and pleased to accede to your wishes." "A bottle of wine here, waiter!" called out Mr. Pederson, wishing to drink his friend's health. The waiter was down stairs, and Rose, glad of the opportunity, ran to the side-board and grasping a bot- tle of port, a tray, and three glasses, ran as far as It   OR THEU DISINHERITED.     161 the parlor door before she noticed that she had forgot- ten the cork-screw. She hurried back in search of it, and Mr. Pederson, impatient, called out at the top of his lungs, "Waiter!" Rose became completely con- fused, and as she could not immediately find the cork- screw, all she could do was to cry '"Coming, sir," for fear the waiter below would hear the call, and thus by obeying deprive her of meeting the kind, good, and generous Mr. Carey. At last she found it, and bounded into the parlor. Carey spoke to her pleasantly, and after pouring, out the wine, she withdrew from the room. The trio drank the contents of the bottle in friendship, and after some further conversation, Mr. Pederson begged to be ex- cused, as his business calledlhim to the bar-room, and having mentioned that KEate would entertain him, he left the room. ' Just what I wish," thought Fellows,- " now I can tell her how devotedly I love her." But some how or ofher, the proper words did'nt come. He brought the glass again and again to his lips, but the moment lhe essayed to speak, his heart be- gan to palpitate; his utterance became choked, and in confusion he cast his eyes to the floor. Yes, the man who' could face an armed traveller to demand his money, without a shudder; whlo bad heard his sentence of death pronounced without changing countenance; who had mounted the decks of a ship in combat, with- out fear,-could not meet the innocent look of a virtu- ous girl, and tell her he loved her. At length he stam- mered forth something upon another subject, for his- intention to speak to her of love had proved a failure. Kate turned her head as if to look from the window, and concealed her disposition to laugh from his view;   162      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, still, fearing she should hear the declaration she per- ceived he had essayed to make; and, not wishing to of- fend him by making the only answer her feelings, honor, or promise would allow, she pretended her domestic af- fairs demanded her attention, and begging he would excuse her, left the roomn "Father, ' said she, coming into the presence of her parent, "I wish you would kindly inform Mr. Carey, as early as possible, that I am engaged. I do not wish to offend him, and I am sure I shall be obliged to do so be- fore long, if you do not, as he nearly made an offer of marriage, after you left the parlor." "How will you be obliged to offend him?" asked Mr. Pederson. "By refusing him my hand." "1 cannot perceive," said Mr. Pederson, "why it- ought to offend a gentleman, because a lady does not feel disposed to accept of him for a husband! But certainly it Would offend him to warn him not to honor you with an offer, when perhaps he hits no intention of so doing." "Allow me to know, dear father; you are aware that the perceptive faculties of women are. keener thran those of men." "Tut, tut! my dear child. Your perceptions are no sharper, nor yet so sharp as those of your old father; so let things take their own way. If Mr. Carey offers himself to you, I do not see that you are obliged to of- fend him." "But I must refuse him," cried Kate. "I do not see that you are obliged to refuse hipn," said her father, calmly, " for I have my doubts about your ever seeing that lieutenant again." "And why not, father?"   OR THE DISINHERITED,     163 '6 Because he'll forget you before that frigate's cruise is half over." , Kate turned away suddenly, and wiped the tears from her eyes. a Come- my child, do not weep; perhaps Mr. Colborn will prove faithful and honorable, and make you his wife; but,"--shaking his head--"I fear me trouble and disappointment will come of the affair if he should. There is such a great difference in the standing of our two families, it is very unreasonable to predict that hap- piness will follow such an union." "But I am confident of Mr. Colborn's honor," said Kate. "Be that as it may, my daughter, I do not think it at all advisable to speak to Mr. Carey upon this sub- jecte"And as he spoke he pressed her hand, and left her. Kate evaded anv private interview with Fellows, al- though she was at all times friendly and loquacious in his society. on the following Sabbath, while Kate had gone to church, M[r. Pederson was seated alone in the sitting- room smoking his pipe, when Fellows entered and seat- ing himself by the fire, joined him in a friendly smoke. "We have been always friendly, Mr. Pederson, and I am quite happy in your own and daughter's society; and I - hem - I have been wishing for an opportunity like this to ask your permission to pay my addresses to her." MAr. Pederson puffed from his mouth a column of smoke larger than usual and answered that he certain- ly had no objections; "but "-and he inhaled and puffed away the smoke from his pipe three times before he finished the sentence,--" but she is already betrothed to a lieutenant in the navy, or at least, thinks she is."   164      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, ".And why should there be a doubt upon the sub- ject?" asked Fellows, hoping there might be a flaw in the engagement,--" but perhaps I am going too far. I humbly beg your pardon for so pressingly asking a question." "No offense! no offense!" exclaimed 31r. Peaderson, "do not mention it. The family of the lieutenant," he continued, " is so far above mine that it is my opinion there would be an endless quarrel between us. As a matter of course, they would not know me, and Kate, I am sure, will not forsake her old father for any man. And in truth, I would much rather she should be unit- ed to a family of our own station in society." The dark eyes of Fellows sparkled with joy at this announcement, as he considered it to be a hint of encour- agement to himself. "I shall not, however," continued Mr. Pederson, "in- terfere with her choice - but here she comes." After dinner, Fellows, having been encouraged by the conversation with Mfr. Pederson, fearlessly stepped to- wards Kate, and asked her if she would favor him with a little private conversation. "I will do so," she answered, " there can certainly be no harm in complying with such a request," and she led the way to the parlor where they seated themselves at opposite sides of the stand. "Your father and myself have had some confidential conversation this morning, during which I'ventured to ask of him the blessed privilege of paying my address- es to his lovely daughter; and his answer was propi- tious to my wishes." "And do you consider that sufficient?" asked Kate, a little ironically. "By no means," he hastily answered, seeing his error, "I humbly beg your pardon. I   acknowledge that I   Olt THE DISINHERITED.     165 neglected to ask your consent in my confusion, an omis,. sion which I hope you will forgive. And now, dear Kate, I humbly ask of you the priceless privilege that I asked this morning of your father." "And what else did my father say to you?" she asked, without yet answering his question. "That yous was betrothed to Mr.,Colborn, a lieuten- ant in the navy.5"  "Then, good sir, let that be my answer to you," said Kate, assuming a serious air, and she arose and walked to the window. "I hope I have not offended you by possessing an overshare of love for you. I did not create it myself, and only regret that you seem to censure me for hav- ing encouraged the passion." At this frank and honorable acknowledgment, Kato became touched, and answered, "I acknowledge your kind and complimentary intention towards me, and am very grateful to you for it, but my gratitude must be that of a friend." Thus speaking, she led the way from the room, and they joined the family as friends. As this plain refusal debarred any further attempt to gain her affections at present,- Fellows determined to try the other object which had an influence upon him in leaving London, viz :- the visiting of the neighbor- hood of Winchester to endeavor to recover the treasures concealed by him and Fletcher in that vicinity. It was extremely risky for hilm to show himself in that quarter, as there were many persons in and about the town who would be likely to recognize him -if he should unfor- tunately meet them - and thus lead to his arrest and execution ; but risk and danger seemed to have a charm to him, especially when taken in connection with the prospect of immense gain, as in the present case,   166      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, The brigantine was observed to have all sail set but her jibs on the following morning, and as her cable was hove short, she appeared to be only waiting for some one on shore before starting off. "Harvey appears to be drying his sails this morning," said Mr. Pederson, as they seated themselves at the breakfast table. "No, sir," returned Fellows, " the brigantine is about to proceed on a trip up the channel, and I shall leave in her." "What! so suddenly! I had hoped we were to have your company longer." "Business, sir," said Fellows, " business must be at- tended to." "'I regret to have you go," said Mr. Pederson, " but business always before pleasure. How long before your return ,'^ "In about a week, if I am not disappointed," was the reply. Rose peeped through the kitchen door as if to say, "I wonder if he'll give me a pound this time." The breakfast over, Fellows paid his bill, gave Rose her expected perquisite, and having bid Kate a friendly adieu, was accompanied by Mr. Pederson to the land- ing. After a short conversation between them, in which the old man invited him kindly to return again as early as possible, Fellows shook him warmly by the hand, stepped into the waiting boat, and soon was on board his vessel. As he ascended the deck, the anchor was tripped, the jibs run up, the head yards hauled around, and the Nancy in a few minutes was standing out of the harbor. Fellows gazed first at the old man upon the shore, then at the inn that contained the old man's pretty daughter, and he could but think that there in that house, which had a far better appearance to him   OR THE DISINHERITED, .    167 than any other, was she who would yet be his wife, not- withstanding so many obstacles stared him in the face. "It is true that I am disappointed," he mentally' said, "for that fortunate lieutenant has won her heart, but yet her father favors me, and has hinted that he some- times thought the aristocrat would never more visit his daughter. Indeed, it looks very reasonable, for why should a man of such an elevated family wish to seek in marriage a person so much beneath him? Nonsense! my chance is pretty good yet; if he abandons her I shall be at once accepted. Foolish girl! she has confidence in his honor, and believes he will do all he has promised, when lo! he has never written her a line! Zounds! my chance is  better; I have Rose in my favor, thanks to the fees which I have put in her hands! I am confident she would do almost anything for me, her every action shows it. I'll go to get my treasures, but will return to question Rose, and renew my suit with her I love."   168      LIEUTENANT COLBORN9 CHAPTER XIX. THE UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH, On arriving at Hurst, numerous recollections of by- gone transactions ran through the mind of Fellows. He thought of the evening that he stepped on board of his vessel in that same harbor, after his singular escape. And yet he was not satisfied, but would run still greater risks. ' If," said he, mentally, - I can obtain the hand of Kate, and regain this treasure, I shall be happy." But even if such good fortune should crown his efforts at last, he would not then be satisfied. No! the mind- of man is never satisfied. He instructed - Harvey to remain at Hurst with the vessel until he returned, and soon after entered a stage coach for the interior. Having remained in the coach the entire day, during which time he had been tossed from side to side in the old-fashioned waay, he halted at a small village for the night. He was very much fatigued, and after partaking of a repast that he also stood very much in need of, he called for a light, and wished to be directed to his room. The landlord begged his pardon for having to place him in the room with another person, but it could not be helped, as there was no vacant room in the house. "Never mind," said Fellows, " as it is only for a night," and soon himself and room-mate 'were sound asleep. At midnight, his companion raised his head from his pillow, and re-lighting the lamp, seemed to sur-   OR TIE DISINHERIT EDo     169 vey the broad features of Fellows, as if with a suspicion that he had seen- them before. Ite threw his feet out of the bed, and placing them carefully on the floor, re- newed his look. With a slight nod of the head, he stood for an instant as if to ascertain whether the little joise he had made had awakened Fellows. But the loud respirations of the latter told at once that he had not been disturbed, and was still in profound sleep. The stranger now advanced to the side of Fellows' bed, and placing the light so that the full rays would fall upon his face, tried that experiment to ascertain how sound asleep he really was. But the rays of the lamp had no effect on the drowsy sleeper, and he con- tinued to snore as before. "It is he!" said the disguised policeman, for such was the room-mate of the tired Fellows, "I had him in charge at Winchester, and cannot be mistaken, and if I arrest him, it will do me great credit, and I shall no doubt receive a large reward. I'll arrest him at once! Yet he is a powerful man, and may escape from me, un- less I obtain assistance. Fie! I afraid that one man will get away from me! nonsense! I wonder how he can be so unwise as to venture here in these parts, after having committed such high-handed offenses.  But that's neither here nor there. I'll awake him. Heigho! stranger, awake! You are my    prisoner!" "What do you wish?" demanded Fellows, as he opened his large black eyes, and stared wildly upon the other. "By Heaven!" exclaimed the astonished policeman, "it is not he after all." "It is not who?" asked Fellows. "Nobody! I was frightened in my sleep! Did-you not hear the noise?"   170      LIEUTENANT COLIORN, C"Noise! what noise'? You must have been dream- ing. Go to bed again, and don't be foolish." The policeman perfectly convinced that he had com- mitted an error, gladly got into bed, quite ashamed of himself for his supposed blunder. After breakfast, on the next morning, they paid their bills at the office respectively, and entering the stage- coach proceeded on their journey. "Are you not subject to frightful dreams?" asked Fellows, casting upon his companion a penetrating look. "I am not," answered the artful policeman, "but somehow or other, I heard a strange and suspicious noise in that inn last night, and very naturally rushed to your bedside." "Then you were frightened by a noise?" said Fel- lows, still looking at him. The policeman was smart, but he saw plainly that his fellow-traveller was quite a match for him. "No! I can not -acknowledge that any noise can frighten me," replied he, well knowing that Fellows would be apt to insinuate that those who are frightened at mere sounds may be cowards, if he admitted that he had been frightened. "Now, you have contradicted yourself," said the wily Fellows, with a smile. "I have caught you in your own trap. What I wish to know," and as he spoke, ie looked at-him meaningly, " is why you were at my bedside?"  The policeman hesitated, for he could not invent mswers as quickly as his opponent could ask questions, and he was thrown off his guard. "Why did you ask me if I had heard the noise?" 3ontinued Fellows, " and why did you appear fright- ;ned, if you do not fear sounds?"   OR THE DISINHERITED.     171 "Oh! I assure you I do not fear any noise," stam- mered the policeman. "Then, sir, you had no right there, and as you show so much guilt in your countenance, I shall look out for you. Do you understand?" Fellows had made these remarks in an elevated voice, having become considerably excited; and unfortunate- ly for him those shrill tones seemed familiar to the ears of the policeman, and again aroused his suspicions. "I declare I have heard that voice before," said the policeman to himself; and at the same time surveyed again the marked features of his fellow-traveler. "Were it not for the changed look of his dark eyes, I would certainly say that he is the very man who escaped from our hands at Winchester. But I will try him on this point." ("Who do you think I am, and what my occupation, that you say you shall look out for me? Think you I am not what I seem? Think you I am a pickpocket?" "That you are a pickpocket I will not deny," said IFellows, sarcastically, " and your occupation is that of a policeman." It had only struck him at that instant that such was , the occupation of the stranger; but fearing he might be recognized, he took this bold stand as being the sur- est way of diverting any suspicion as to his identity that might be lurking in the policeman's breast. "' Why do you take me to be a policeman? Is it be- cause you have been once in my power, and are now again?" These were questions that under like circumstances would have disconcerted any other man than Fellows. But hze changed not a muscle, while the other passen- gers gazed at him with astonishment. He knew well   172      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, what was passing in the policeman's mind, and that if recognized fully there were many in the coach who would willingly assist in his arrest. Upon his answer, then, depended his chance of escape. "I said I took you to be a policeman," replied Fel- lows, "yet all the while I know you to be a pickpocket, and being a policeman myself, I make this my business to arrest you. Sir, you are my prisoner!" and as he spoke, he assumed an air of importance, and seized the astonished officer by the collar. "What do you mean," stammered the policeman, "Let go of me! I'll arrest you for assaulting an officer! Let go of me, I say!" and he struggled to free himself from his grasp. "I call upon you, good citizens, in the name of the king, " cried the self-made officer, " to assist me in ar- resting this vagabond! and you well know the punish- ment for refusing to assist a servant of the king, in time of danger." "I'm no vagabond," cried the now astonished officer "but a policeman in disguise. Oh! good friends, take this fellow from me," continued he, as Fellows roughly hurled him from side to side. "Assist me!" again demanded Fellows, "this fellow is a thief!" "That we will!" cried several of the passengers, and the next instant the policeman was seized, on all sides, while some called on the postillion to stop the coach. "  'Tis false! 'tis false! I'm not a thief! I am a po- liceman." "What shall we do with the wretch?" asked a pas- senger of Fellows. ' Oh!" cried the policeman, "how can Heaven look down and witness such injustice?"   OR THE DISINHERITED.     173 "What blasphemy!" said another. "Look here!" called out the postillion, "I can't stop here this way, I must drive on." "Well, drive on then!" said Fellows, "and we'll put him out," and as the stage moved on again, they thrust him out, closing the door after him, and he fell to the ground, shouting at the height of his voice, "a pretty way this, to treat a policeman!" Fellows looked behind as the stage rolled away, and as he saw the cast-out brushing the dirt from his clothes, he smiled, saying to himself, "Perhaps the next time he meets me, he mnay recognize me." It was not until the third day after the occurrence above related, that the tall spires of Winchester became visible; and as Fellows had made up his mind to show himself as little as possible in that vicinity, he was re- joiced when the vehicle stopped at the landing opposite that goodly town. He did not cross the river, for the death sentence had too recently rung in his ears to make him desirous of seeing its streets, but proceeded north- wardly on foot along its banks, towards the woods where the treasure was concealed. It was dark when he ar- rived at the edge of the wood, and being much fatigued and hungry, he tapped at the door of a small lonely cot- tage that stood on uncultivated ground, so much sur- rounded by the tall trees that nothing but its e:xtreme top could be seen. An elderly man, clad in coarse and cheap habiliments, answered the summons. ,c I am a traveler," said Fellows, " worn-out and hun- gry, and I have lost my way. Will you do me the favor to get me a supper, and find me a bed for the night?' "We are very poor," answered the old man, "but   174      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, walk in, and such as we have my old woman will give you, but we cannot lodge a gentleman like you in our house, our rooms are so small.') "Good enough! good enough!" said Fellows as he entered, " but first give me something to eat, and we'll talk about other matters afterwards." "By the Virgin Mary," cried out the old man, " he looks hungry and way-worn, so bring on all you have, Moll. Sit down, sir, sit down," continued he, turning to his guest; and Fellows seated himself at a small oak table that stood in the center of the room. The old woman was neatly, but like her husband, poorly clad. Her form was considerably bent with age, yet she was quite active, and bid fair to live much longer than many who had not seen half her years. They lived alone in the little cottage, their children had been mar- ried off, and like a nest of birds had flown away, and left the old ones to age and loneliness. She brought in a loaf of bread and a piece of meat, and placed them on the table before Fellows. "I'll make it right with you," said the latter, as he cut into the food, and began to eat voraciously. "I will pay you well for this, either now cr in the morning." She brought on some potatoes and a cup of tea; and Fellows, having satiated his appetite, thanked the good old people. "And now for a bed," thought he, but on looking around the room every thing bespoke so much want, that he began to doubt if there really was such an article in the house. Three oaken chairs - the backs of which reached far above one's head when seated - were the only articles of furniture to be seen. A small narrow shelf, above a large fire-place, supported a Bible, the ancient covers of which were really a curiosity. On one side was placed a lamp, which threw out a dim   OR TIHE DISINIERITED.    -175 ligllht, hardly perceptible in the blaze of the wood upon the andirons in the fire-place. Two small windows hav- ing very small panes of glass, lighted the room by day, and were partly covered by white cotton cloth, suspend- ed'by a string as curtains. Fellows joined the old man in a smoke, and the trio became quite talkative. "Have you lived here long?" he asked, hoping to draw some conversation from them about the arrest of himself and Fletcher. "More than twenty years," answered the old man, ' and I've seen some hard times and strange sights in that time." "I do not understand what you mean by strange sights, but by hard times I presume you mean high prices and also high taxes." "High prices and high taxes you can well say," joined the old woman, " the members of the government fix it so we poor folks suffer very much. They tax us in war-time, they say, to carry on the war, and in time of peace, to pay off the debt," and she declared they had become so poor by taxation, that she could hardly buy "a hap'orth o' ale." u' The strange sights I spoke of," said the old man, "used to be quite plenty about here twenty years ago. Highwaymen then frequently committed depredations and outrages, but of late years they keep more to the north. They dare not come about here now. I have not known. of one being about here, since the escape of that terrible fellow who was to be hung in Winchester. Oh! it was a great race they had before they took him and his companion at first. One was hung, and the other got away." As he spoke he placed his pipe on the mantel-piece, after tapping its bowl on the andirons to discharge the ashes.   176      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Fellows looked inquiringly at the speaker, then at the old woman, and said, "There was a grand race, then?" "Ay! by Jove! a chase that will be remembered a long time in these parts." "Indeed! how was it, pray?" The old man moved his chair nearer the fire, and passing his hand over his bald head, as if to recall his memory, began, "You see         there were two robbers stopping at the Western Tavern in the town, and by some means or other they were discovered, but before the police could effect their arrest, they mounted their horses, and gal- loped away on the country road." -"Is it possible!" exclaimed Fellows with an air of astonishment. "Ay! and about thirty men -many of them police- men -leaped upon horses as soon as possible, and fol- lowed in the pursuit. The robbers had about two miles the start, but several of the pursuing horses being much the fastest, made it just the prettiest race I ever saw." "Then you saw it," said Fellows. "I did; they passed me about a mile below here, the pursuers close -upon the robbers, and made the dust fly, I can tell you. The policemen galloped at a fright- ful rate, all the time gaining on the robbers." It Why were they not captured, then?" "Because they reached the woods, just in time to save themselves." "I see!" exclaimed Fellows, " they escaped by reach- ing the thick woods." "They did not escape," cried the old man, " for they were taken in a tree, imprisoned, tried, and sentenced to be hung." "Indeed!"   OR THE DISINHERITED.     1" ( One of them, Fletcher, as I said before, was hanged, but the other, Fellows, escaped, and has never been heard of since." "Can it be possible!" exclaimed Fellows in assumed astonishment. ' Ay! and never was there such an excitement in these parts before, never so many people collected to- gether as on the day of the execution in Winchester." "One of the wretches escaped, did he?" asked Fel- lows, " which way did they pursue him?" "On the road towards Epsom, as he was seen to go that way." "Happy- fate!' thought he, " for that is what saved me.9 "Yes, on the road to Epsom,"99 said the old man, "but they never have seen or heard from him from that day to this, and it is most probable that he has fled to some foreign country, and will never dare to return to. England more." "It is a great pity they could not have taken the vag- abond," said Fellows, "he certainly ought to have been hung as much as the other." "' Just as much," said the old man. "And how far from this," asked Fellows, "is the place where he was arrested?" "Not far, perhaps half a mile." "Do you know the place?" "I have seen the tree twice, but could never find it again, as it stands in the midst of many others almost just like it." On hearing this, Fellows concluded he had learned all from them that would be of service to him, and re- marked that he was becoming quite sleepy, and wished to retire. 9   178      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "uThe room we have for you is small, and has no finery,'"'said the old woman, " but it is the best we have, and we hope you will be comfortable.9 '"It is no doubt quite good enough," said Fellows, and he was led into what the old woman called a bed- room. The little apartment did indeed require an apol- ogy. It contained a bed, or rather a pallet, but no other furniture. There was no lock on the door, so Fellows placed the foot of the bed hard against it, and falling his full length upon it, said to himself, "There is more than one way to lock a door," and soon fell asleep. He dreamed of money, policemen, and pretty Kate. Having become very' much refreshed by the sleep, he arose at daybreak, and sauntered out into the forest, without awaking the old people. He penetrated the deep thickets, where himself and Fletcher had rested, and amidst which they were afterwards taken, while many gloomy thoughts passed through his mind; and withal he could not conceal from himself the -fact, that the most trifling occurrence might cause him to be ar- rested and hung. He wandered here and there until he reached the road. "Now I am near the spot," he soliloquized, " but where is the tree? Why did I not ask Fletcher to tell me how he. had marked the spot and tree? but alas! I had more serious matters to con- sider then! I must search and find it. I'll go down the road at some distance from the forest, and come back; by so doing perhaps I may remember its position; but there have been many trees felled since we were here, their stumps are on everyv hand; and perhaps some one of these is the tree I look for. If so, the money and trinkets are in the possession of another. In that case, I hope it is some poor wood-cutter; if so, he would be poor no longer." Thus soliloquizing, Fel-   OR THE DISINHERITED,    . 179 lows walked out of the forest, and, turning to the left, proceeded leisurely along, glancing at the brush and hedges on either side; but he was like a person who had never been there before, and indeed his organ of locality must have been extraordinarily large, to enable him to remember objects and scenes around him, as he passed them at a gallop, when flying for his life. He returned again to the forest, stopped, and looked around, but scores and hundreds of trees bore a resemblance to. the one he had in mind, and he continued to look in vain. Finally he paced his way back to the house. "We have been waiting for vou an hour," said tho old woman, X" and had you not left your overcoat, we would have thought you had gone for good.9' "I was taking an early walk, as is my custom," re- plied Fellows, - and strolled too far." "Gome, let's take breakfast,' said the old man; and to the astonishment of Flellows, there was spread before him a very good repast. The old man, knowing he would be well paid, had gone to a neighbor's, and ob- tained the necessary articles to entertain the stranger. "You mentioned last night," said Fellows, after they began to eat, " that you had seen that tree in which those robbers were concealed." "Yes, I have seen it twice," answered the old man, u' but I do not know it from other trees now.5" "If you should see it, do you not think you would know it? 9 "I hardly think I should," he replied, " for it is some time since I saw it, and besides I did not take so much interest in it as many about here dclid. I was very well satisfied the vagabonds were taklen, and cared little as to the exact spot where they were captured." "But I am curious about such matters! What kind    180      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, of a looking tree was it? Did it have no peculiar mark about it, that would enable one to designate it?" "None whatever," was the reply, " and it looked to me just like scores of others around it." "But can you not find out this tree for the gentle- man, father?" asked the old woman. "Yes, perhaps so, as he seems to be very anxious to see it." "It's of no consequence," said Fellows, "I would like to see it well enough, but would not put you to so much trouble." "Oh! it's no trouble at all," said the old man, " after breakfast, we'll just step over to neighbor D -s, and I dare say he can inform us." Fellows made no further objection, and they accom- panied neighbor D -, who said he knew right where to put his hand on it, as he had been there many times. "Are there many who visit the tree?" asked Fellows. "Not many now, occasionally one or two, sometimes - party, but last year and back to the time when the arrest was made, there were many visits paid to this -hiding place of two of the greatest robbers that have disturbed the highways of England since the days of Robin-Hood." "They must indeed have been great villains," re- marked Fellows, with'a sanctimonious air. "Indeed they were!" said the neighbor, 'but the worst of it all was that the greatest wretch of the two got away, and escaped punishment." "What a pity," replied Fellows feelingly, "' but how much farther have we to go?" "Not far," answered D -. "But who have we here, coming up the pathway?" "That very policeman," said Fellows, and darted into   OR THE DISINHERITED.      181 the forest, leaving the others to meet the man he dared not. He ran hastily back to the cottage, and throwing a piece of gold to the old woman, disappeared. He plunged through the thickest part of the forest that lay to' the south, in order to get away unperceived. Thence he emerged upon the plain that lay beyond it, often casting his eyes behind him, fearing he was already pursued. At length the forest was lost in the distance behind him, and he threw himself upon the ground, al- most breathless. "It is all up with the treasure now," he soliloquized, "'for I shall never return to those woods again. It was easily obtained, and as easily lost. But if I can win Kate Pederson, I will whistle at the loss of that paltry treasure. Fie'! let it go, for I have plenty more," and he resumed his journey with as much speed as he could. He reached Hurst in safety, and found Harvey waiting patiently for his return. Thirteen days only had elapsed since the Nancy de- parted from Plymouth, and now her anxious owner wished to return thither at once. Suffice it to say that she set sail, and arrived in safety, and anchored in the: old spot. Fellows immediately repaired to his old lodging house still determined to win Kate if possible. He was welcomed by the family as usual, and Mr. Pederson, shaking him heartily by the hand, said he hoped he would remain with them months instead of days.   18t    LIEUTENANT COLBORN CHAPTER XX. THE HAPPY NEWS. Rose smiled as she heard his voice, and thought of another perquisite; but shortly after, she was perfectly delighted to see him venture to enter the kitchen to shake hands with her. Fellows had sought this interview as soon as the con- versation with Mr. Pederson and Kate had ended. He commenced talking about 'cookery, and other home af- fairs, as a kind of apology for entering the kitchen, and finding Rose much pleased to see him, he wished to know if she would keep secret -what he was about to ask. Rose was rather astonished at this familiarity, but re- plied that if his question was proper she would not tell of it. "Is it true, then," he asked, ' that Lieutenant Col- born and Miss Pederson are going to make a match -"- "Of course it is." "But I have heard that he has not written to her." "I don't think he has." "And do you not know?" I do not'know for certain," she replied, " but then I am almost sure he has not." "You have seen him, of course," said Fellows. "Oh, yes, sir, many times." "Is he a fine-looking man?" "Very." "Very fine-looking?"   OR THE DISINHERITED.  "Yes, sir, like yourself." is Thank you for the compliment, but do you really think she loves him?" "Ha, ha," laughed Rose, " now you are coming it too strong." "Do you think he loves her, then?" C"Ha, ha, ha. Mr. Carey, I have no right to talk with a gentleman like you about such things." "But there is no harm in such conversation." And as he spoke he placed a sovereign in her hand. Rose looked at the yellow metal, and asked, "What do you mean by this, sir?" "I give it to you as a present," he replied. "Oh! I thank you, sir! You are very kind." And she made him a low courtesy. "Do you think she loves him?" asked Fellows, now expecting she would answer, as the sovereign had ap- peared to act like a charm. "I am sure she does." "And does he love her?" "I think he does." "Did he often visit her?" '"Yes, sir, quite often, just before he sailed." "I am of opinion," said he, " that her father does not approve of the match." Rose remained silent, and stood fingering her apron strings in deep thought. "Is it not so?" "I cannot say." "Iave you never heardl him say as much?" "' I am not sure." ( But can you not recollect of his saying anything to this effect?" ' I do not wish to answer more, Mr. Carey." 1   "EUTENANT COLBORN, Fellows slipped into her hand another pound, and re- peated the question. "I have heard him say," said Rose, " that he thought the marriage would bring about much unhappiness." Have you ever heard Miss Pederson speak of me?" "I have." "How?" "As an acquaintance, a lodger; but in no other man- ner." "Did you never hear her speak for or against me?" "I never heard her speak against any one. She is a lady, and never talks about people.9" "And then you have heard her speak in my favor?" "Yes! no! or rather that you were a fine man. She spoke as she would of any gentleman acquaintance." "Is Mr. Colborn her first love?" "He is." "And her only love?" "He must be, for I have been told that a person loves only one." "Have you never loved?" "Now   you come too strong, again, Mr. Carey! I will not tell you." "But I will keep it secret." "Why do you wish to know?" "Curiosity." "Ha! ha! I'll not tell you; but I think you are in love, Mr. Carey." "Whom with?" "Miss Pederson." "I am. I love her dearly, and wish you to assist me to win her." "You should have come sooner." "Why? Do you think she would have accepted of me had I done so?" la.    OR THE DISINHERITEDO "I don't know. I know of no reason why she should have refused you, had you come before she had seen Mr. Colborn." "Then, if the lieutenant should abandon her, you think she would accept me." "I don't know." "' I ask your opinion." "I know not why she should refuse so fine a man." "Thank you ;" and Fellows chucked her under the chin, saying: "Mind you keep the secret," and he walked into the sitting-room. Here he paced the floor alone, in deep contemplation. He had a hope- and, in fact, it was his only hope - that Colborn's mind would be changed by the influence of friends and absence fi'om the object of his love. But he was destined to be disappointed, for on that very evening Kate received a letter from the faithful lieutenant. She was alone when the precious missive was handed her, and as her eyes fell on the well-known handwriting, she burst into tears of joy; and pressing the letter to her lips, ran up stairs to her room, that she might read its contents undisturbed. She opened it hastily, and for the sake of curiosity, let us take a peep over her 'shoulder at those-to her- precious lines: OTAHEITE, June 1 lth. DEAR EST KATE :-It is with emotions of ecstacy that I now commence a letter to her I love. It has been long since an opportunity offered for the conveyance of letters to England, and the present one has converted me from a gloomy and low-spirited man to one of the most cheerful and grateful beings in enx istence. I am aware that this voyage has not been more disa. 9*   "EUTENANT COLBORN, greeable, or attended with more hardships and dangers, than other voyages; nor does the portion of it yet to come bid fair to be more unpleasant than what I have already experienced, but yet I have not been contented and happy as I was formerly. I have been constantly anxious for the time to pass, that the frigate might re. turn to England. Can you not solve the riddle? Why should I have such feelings now, when I never had them on former voyages? Fortunately, the object of our voyage is nearly accomplished, and we will no doubt sail for home ere long. And when I come in sight of my native country, how I shall be elated with anxiety and hope! especially when I enter the harbor of Plymouth, where I have spent so many happy hours! What will be my feelings? What my joy? But I leave that for another to answer, trusting she will be able to judge of such emotions by her own. Dear Kate, when I was a boy, I used to dream of the happiness of becoming a sailor-boy, and cared more for such musings than I did for my studies. When I was transferred from school to a ship as midshipman, my mind aspired to promotion; but when I became a man, my dreams were of a beautiful and sylph-like girl, who sat by my side, walked with me, talked with me and only to me, who loved me deaily, with a chaste and virtuous affection, such as our mothers entertained for our fathers! This dream became reality! The angelic being of my air-castles and your lovely self are one and the same. Need I say I long to meet you again? Oh! when the time arrives, how great will be my happiness! We will be united by ties that are indissoluble, and no power thereafter shall separate us. Till then, adieu, and believe me unceasingly Yours,       WILLIAM.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     87 CHAPTER XxI THE FRIGATES ARRIVAL, It was a stormy day on the sixth of January. The year had come in drearily, and for several days the bright sun had not been able, with all his wonderful power, by day, nor the moon, with her lesser light, aided by millions of stars, by night, to penetrate the heavy, massy clouds that hung over the English Chan- nel and the contiguous portion of the North Atlantic. One heavy cloud after another passed over from the W. S. W., driven by gales that had been constantly blowing. At times the atmosphere became dense, but soon as the clouds passed, the horizon again became visible. The seas were rolling, and tumbling, and cap- ping white on all sides, and high above them flew the sea-gull and Mother Carey's chicken, finding no place of rest on the troubled waves. On4ethe rocks and beaches heavy breakers could be seen, sending high in air the white foam, and-the gust would hurl its force upon it and scatter for many rods the briny liquid. Upon the land, men, muffled in over- coats to guard against the cold, hurried from one office or other place of business to another; while in-doors the howling and moaning wind cast a dismal feeling over the inmates, who, to keep comfortable, were obliged to hover around the fire. The hills and fields in the coun- try, and streets of cities and towns, were white with snoWe Winter had come in its most rigorous forml   1 8   h   LIEUTENANT COLBORN, The Iace Horse, rolling along under close-reefed topsails, had already entered the channel. Daylight approached, and as a passing cloud disappeared, the welcome sound of Land, ho! was shouted fore and aft, and caused the hearts of all on board to leap with joy. Presently the snow-covered hills of the Land's End ap- peared fully in sight. On dashed the ship, and having arrived off Plymouth and fired signal guns, a pilot cutter ventured from the harbor to her assistance. It was impossible to board in such a heavy sea, but the cutter signalized for the frigate to follow her; and as all on board, and particu- larly those in command, had no desire to put out into the channel again, and there remain a week, perhaps, waiting for fine weather, they concluded to enter the harbor, notwithstanding the weather was so boisterous. The pilot-boat led the way and the frigate followed, the gale blowing them directly towards the town and into safe anchorage. A dense and threatening cloud now dropping down over the land, enveloped everything on shore from their view. It was accompanied by a heavy squall, that blew most furiously for the remainder of that short January day. It was dark when it had passed- disclosing to view the lights of the town and harbor. The ship lay near the shore, and quickly two of her boats were manned, and in spite of wind and darkness, -pulled towards the landing, conveying several officers, who were too anxious to meet their friends to mind the weather. Amongst them   was Lieutenant Colborn, dressed in a long coat, whose cape covered his head to protect his face and neck from the storm. He walked up Pell street, followed by his boat's crew, and entered the inn. He invited them to call for any drink they   OR THE DISINHERITED.     189 wished at his expense, and ascended the stairs to the dining-room. Mr. Pederson, Kate, Fellows, and another lodger were quietly taking tea, unaware of the arrival of the Race Horse, when he entered the room. Doffing his cap respectfully, with a smile on his countenance, he made a low bow. Kate screamed, and, rising from her seat, blushed crimson, but could not find words to speak a welcome. Mr. Colborn!" exclaimed Rose, from the kitchen. 'I Why, Air. Colborn! Is it possible?" said Mr. Pe- derson. The lieutenant stepped towards Kate and shook her hand, but by great exertion repre oled the desire he had to imprint a kiss on her cherry lips, and as he turned to be introduced by the host to the strangers at the table, she disappeared through the parlor door. "Do not let me disturb you, Mr. Pederson and gen- tlemen," said Colborn; and bowing politely, he took the liberty to follow Kate into the parlor. Here he threw down his cap and overcoat, and rush- ing towards her as she stood like a statue in the center of the room, clasped her to hif bosom. That there were not warm kisses given and returned by either party, we will not undertake to avouch, not being present. Immediately after the disappearance of the lieuten- ant and Kate, Fellows left the table and ascended to his own room. u The devilish aristocrat!!" he soliloquized, " is in that parlor alone with her, and perhaps in her arms! How she screamed and blushed! I had hoped that the fel- low had sunk in the sea to rise no more! What busi- ness has one of his stamp to seek a wife in this family? Why does he not keep to his own aristocratic class?   190      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, She may rue it yetl But I'll go to Rose, for she some. times gives me hints that are of some consolation." "Rose I!" he said, as he entered the kitchen, a he's come at last, and by the appearance of Miss Pederson as he entered, I fear my case is hopeless!" Rose remained silent. "Do you not think so?" he continued. "You know, Mr. Carey, that I can not judge of these things as well as you." "Why not?" "Because I am but a poor, ignorant girl, and you a gentleman of much experience." "But that ought not to make any difference as to what we see," said Fellows. "I see no more than you do," said Rose, laughing. "And that's enough to drive one mad," said he; (" but tell me, Rose, and candidly, what you think of the fam- ily trouble we have before spoken about." "I really do not know more about it than you do, sir." ' "But what is your opinion?" "I think his family will not like the match." "That is no answer, Rose, for we know that such is the case; but the question is, do you think they will break it off?" "I think they'll try." "And will succeed?" "Miss Pederson is very firm and resolute, when her mind is made up." "I am very sorry for it." "There are other girls as pretty." "I do not think so." Rose resumed her kitchen work, and Fellows left her, muttering that he believed that the aristocrat would be   OR THE DISINHERITED,     191 made to rue it yet--and ascended to his room. Here he walked the floor in misery, to think he was about to lose the only chance of winning the only girl he had ever seen that he fondly and truly loved. William remained a few days at Plymouth, during which time he and Kate were indeed happy. He spent most of his time with her, and he made up his mind that circumstances should never again separate them. Filial duty, however, demanded that he should visit his parents, and at length he bade Kate an affectionate adieu, declaring he 'would soon return, and departed for home. General and Mrs. Colborn had been wondering why their son was so tardy in coming to them, after the ar- rival of the frigate, notwithstanding that they knew of his attachment. One or the other had frequently looked from the window, hoping to descry him approaching; and they felt the more uneasy from the fact that George North had, immediately on the arrival of the frigate, reached his home, and had visited Melissa. "At last, he's come!" said the general, as the car- riage that conveyed him drove up to the door. Sir William shook him heartily by the hand, and led him into the drawing-room. Mrs. Colborn burst into tears and fell on his neck, and Melissa kissed him with all the fondness of an affectionate sister. ",It appears to me that Willie does not look as stout as when he left us," said Mrs. Colborn; " does he, Wil- liam?" "I see no difference," answered the general, 6 he is surely quite a heavy man." "Have you enjoyed good health, my son?" ' Very good, mother, if I except a slight fever for two days, contracted at Rio."   192      LIEUTENANT COLBORN,. "I am thankful that kind Providence has protected you," she continued, as she ran her fingers fondly through his hair. "So am I, mother - kind Providence and the - good frigate!" "The frigate, my son, would have been but a frail means of security, unless the guiding hand of Him who holds the winds and seas at his command had protected her." "Tell us all about your voyage," said the general. "What a tremendous hurricane that must have been which you experienced in the Bay of Biscay!" "It was, indeed, a heavy gale," said William, " and'it would take me a long time to describe it. Has North been here yet?" "Yes," calmly answered the general, " he was here yesterday; he has also been here to-day, and I wonder you. did not meet his carriage, for/he left here but a short time since."      !, "Then he arrived before me," said William, but did not notice the gloom that covered his mother's face, as she gave a deep-drawn sigh. However, all things went on agreeably enough that evening; they were too much rejoiced to meet their only son to introduce any subject which might lead to unpleasant altercation. Morning came, breakfast was announced, and after the usual salutations they seated themselves at the table. There did not appear to be 'that cheerfulness which marked the previous evening, but whether it had been caused by the want of a good night's rest, or by some- thing that referred to himself, William could not per- ceive. But certainly there was an appearance of deep thought in his father, a gloomy soberness on the coun-   OR THE DISINHiERITEDo   ' 193 tenance of his mother, and a sly, inquisitive look in Me- lissa's large eyes,.as they drank their coffee, which he could not but notice. With the exception of an occa sional remark, generally by lMelissa or himself, the breakfast ended without conversation. After breakfast, William walked to the study, arid taking a book, looked through it at the plates, but could not interest himself in its contents. "There is something wrong here," he said to himself, "and I can not imagine what it is, unless North has written to Melissa of my courtship. By Jove, this is most likely! I might have known that the haughty, stuck-up fool would have tattled all he knew. .Sup- pose I should disclose to her what I know of him-but he need not fear, I will not be so unmanly. But what shall I do? I must tell my father! It is a hard task;" and he sighed as the idea crossed his brain that he must inform that proud man of his betrothal to a bar-maid. "But then," thought he, "I have done no. harm! I have committed no wrong! I have not basely and treacherously deceived a heart-broken woman! What, then, should I fear? I will go immediately and disclose to him my intentions towards Kate!"9 , iy    194      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER XXII. THE PARENTS' DISPLEASURE. He did not have to seek the opportunity, for the next instant the general entered the half-open door, and say- ing, "I had lost you, my son," took a seat beside him.  "I am really glad to meet you alone, father," said William, "for I have something of importance to disclose to you." "Indeed!" exclaimed the general - and he instantly assumed a serious air - " and what is it?" "I have made a matrimonial selection." The general gave a deep-drawn sigh as he asked, "What lady's hand have you solicited?" "That of Miss Kate Pederson, of Plymouth," promptly answered his son. The brow of the proud man became instantly knitted. "Whose daughter - and of what proud family?" "The daughter of Mr. George Pederson - and of a respectable although poor family." "What is Mr. Pederson's business?" "An inn-keeper." The general, who had been changing from side to side on his chair for some time, now arose, and com- menced pacing the floor hastily. At length he stopped by the side of his son, and said, "But you cannot be in earnest, William! Say, my dear boy, you only de- sire to flirt with her!" William looked him full in the face, and with a firm voice said: "Sir, I am in earnest.')   OR THE DISINHERITED.      195 "I can not believe you," said his father. "I see through it all - I have been a young man myself." "I can assure you, dear father, that my intentions to- wards Miss Pederson are perfectly honorable." "And do you mean to say that you are really going to unite yourself to such a person and family, thereby disgracing us all?" "I can not see how my marriage with a virtuous lady can in any way disgrace you, sir," was the son's rejoin- der, " and I really will not understand you as suggest- ing that there is such a condition attached to virtue, pure and intrinsic virtue, as disgrace!" ' You will not!" said the general, with a sneer. "No, sir."  "But our family, house, and rank are exalted, and we wish to keep them so; if you marry beneath us, or at least so far beneath us, you detract from the proud name of Colborn." "I can not see, sir," said William, very respectfully, "how my union with the lady I have selected can lower the standing of our house, unless it be already tottering, for it can not be very permanent if such a trivial cir- cumstance is sufficient to shake it." The general became serious. Until now he could but think that his son, following the habit of most young men when away from home, had simply been engaged in a flirtation; but now he was assured that he had been mistaken. "William!" said he, "you have ever been a noble and dutiful son; and are you now going to be diso- bedient?" "I hope not, sir," answered William, " for, I trust, you are not going to drive me to any such step." "I have to request," said the general, in a decided   196      LIEUTENANT COLBORY, tone of voice, " that you will abandon this low girl, and become again your former self." "Dear father, I cannot comply with your request." "Then you will' blight all the bright and promising hopes that your former acts have inspired in your dear- est friends." "I trust that you are mistaken, sir," said the son, "and as I see no objections to my union with Miss Pe- derson, excepting such as come of family pride, I must remain firm to my determination of making her my wife." "I will talk no more with such a madman," angrily shouted the general; and abruptly left him. "It is true! too true!" said the general, as he en- tered the drawing-room where his lady and Melissa were 'seated; "William has engaged himself to this inn- keeper's daughter." "I feared so," sobbed Mrs. Colborn. "I know his plebeian views, as well as his firmness when his mind is made up. He is opposite in almost every trait to Me- lissa. He always professed to detest pride from his, youth, while she, on the contrary, has a great deal of love for pride and family elevation! And yet her will is so weak that her views can be changed almost as easily as those of a child." "Where is Willie?" asked Mrs. Colborn. "In the study." he was immediately sent for, and as he appeared his mother embraced him, saying, "My son, I am told you are bent upon taking a step, which, if persisted in, will bring down your mother's pride so low, and entail upon her such sorrow, as will, I fear, bring her prema- turely to the cold grave." And as she spoke she fell upon a sofa, and continued to weept   OR THE DISINHERITED.     197 William raised his eyes from the carpet, and as he fixed them on the ashy features of his mother, they filled with tears. The anger of his father, and the haughty disapproval of his sister, had made no impres- sion on his determination; but to see his dear mother in agony was too much, and his firmness began to give way. His heart must have been indeed hard if it had not been touched by such a scene. ' Dear mother,? he cried, "I am really unhappy to see you mourn so." And he placed his arms around her neck, and kissed her again and again. ' Then why do you make me mourn by acting so dis- gracefully?" said she, bitterly. "Let us talk reasonably upon this affair," said Wil- liam, " that you all appear to think so fraught with ill and reproach. You would not wish to deprive your children of happiness, would you, dear mother?" Mrs. Colborn did not answer, but the general said, sharply, "Of course not." "It is a principle allowed by all mothers," said Wil- liam, 't in fact, by all just and good people, and always has been, that man, to be happy, must have a wife. God has plainly ordered it. But to insure this happi- ness, he must have the choice of his heart, - and this you would deny me." "We do not deny you the privilege," said the gene- ral, " if you choose among ladies of rank." "But as I have never seen one among them that I could love," said William, '" and as you do not allow me to make a choice amongst ladies who are not of rank, the result is the'same, so far as my happiness is con- cerned." "Tut! tut! Williaml!" exclaimed the general, "you know we do not wish to deprive you of a wife; but on the contrary wish you to obtain one."   198      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "But she must be a lady of rank, though!" said Mrs. Colborn. "Yes - a lady equal with yourself and family," ad- ded his father. "Make a selection of either of the many young ladies of Melissa's acquaintance, and we will rejoice to honor her as a future daughter-in-law. But the one you have selected we will not, cannot ac- knowledge; you have foolishy gone far below your rank and position in society, and made a choice wholly unworthy of yourself. or family." "Respected father, I know you are in'sentiment a fatalist, and from your own theory, often inculcated upon me, I would show why I should marry as I have chosen. "A man may be often in society, and form intimate acquaintanceship with many ladies who are beautiful, graceful, rich, accomplished, and youthful, but, although wishing to marry, he may not fancy either; when, per- haps, in a lone country farm-house, a simple, unassum- ing girl, coarsely and cheaply clad, unaccomplished, and without beauty, may at the first sight will his love; and to become happy, he must obtain her for his wife. "Again, a lady of rank and wealth, whose hand is sought after by many young, fine-looking men, men pos- sessed of honor, rank, wealth, station, brilliant talents, and accomplishments, may turn from them all, and even marry her footman; perhaps an uneducated, ordinary- looking, unaccomplished, uncultivated man, who igno- rantly, unintentionally, and almost instantaneously wins her heart. Or, if not marry him, at least may love him. Hundreds of both sexes, and particularly in aristocratic society, could corroborate my assertion, if they would truly state the feelings of their hearts. And IL have no doubt that hundreds, yes, thousands, could bear wit- ness, that, had they not married to suit family pride,   OR THE DISINHERITED.     199 but, on the contrary, followed the dictates of their own hearts, they might now be happy, instead of dragging away their lives in inharmonious unions. Why do hearts make selections so unequal? Why such strange and contrary sympathies? Why do they refuse to fancy where they appear to be so well adapted to each other? It must be from the mandates of a destiny hanging over us all! It must be that the finger of God thus indi- cates those destined for our future happiness; and when we disobey the monitor, and listen to man's arguments in regard to rank, family, wealth, et ceetera, we are inna fair way to make ourselves wretched for life!" "That I am a fatalist, to ascertain degree," said the general, ac is most true; but you carry it too far. That fate points out our objects of attachment I do not deny, but certainly it points to more than one; for it would be folly to suppose that there is but one woman in ex:- istence capable of making a man happy, or vice versa. Experience proves that persons have been quite as strongly attached to their second or third partners as to their first. The simple fact is, there are numbers that fate has selected for our partners, and the laws of man allowing only one, we need never to go out of our sphere-to obtain the right one! ' Now, when you became enamored of that poor girl, you should not have encouraged. the attachment, but on the contrary; you should have discouraged it; and at the same time encouraged an attachment for some one in your own class, and by so doing you would soon have forgotten the other, and fate would soon have riv- eted your affections to the favored fair one of your own rank." "And that is what you ought to do at once," said Mrs. Colborn.   200       LIEUlTENANT COLBORN, "But there is no other girl I can ever be happy with, dear mother." "Tut! tut!" exclaimed Sir William, thinking, per- haps, he had shaken his son's opinion a little, " you will be ashamed of this in five years. Be a man! a- gentle- man of rank to fill your father's place I The name of our proud house descends in you." "And how can my wife possibly affect the descent of the name of Colborn, sir?" asked the son, respectfully. '"She certainly must take my name, but you seem to speak as if she ought to be of too much consequence to take my name. No, sir. I can not understand why family pride is of more real worth than happiness.". ":But- all this talk -about choice and matches made in heaven," said Sir William, " is all nonsense, after all. If you select a fair young lady like Miss Arabella or El- len, my word for it, she will mage you love her after marriage. Why, son, you do not know how great is the happiness in the matrimonial state. You are but a boy! an inexperienced boy!" "Then did you have no choice, sir?" asked William, "no particular, indescribable fancy for my mother? Had you no voice in the matter at all? or was it all ar- ranged by my grandparents, and others of the family, without regard to your affections or wishes?" "I do not feel disposed to answer such an impertinent question!" said the general, sharply. "I humbly beg your pardon, sir," said William; "and I declare I had no intention of offending either yourself, sir, or my honored mother." "But, Willie," said his mother, kindly, "can you not try to forget to love that low girl, and select an- other?" "I can not, dear mother, but on the contrary, would ask a favor of yourself."   OR THE DISINHERITED,     201 "If the favor is reasonable, I will grant it, my son; but what is it,?" "That you will consent td make your son happy, by forgetting former prejudices and cruel feelings against his chosen bride, and accept her as a' daughter-in-law." The proud descendant of a long line of aristocratic ancestors cast upon her son a look of mingled pity and scorn. Although she had given way to the-impulse ox her better nature; although the characteristic of wom- an's love for her offspring had predominated in her heart since her son's arrival ; yet now that accursed love for inherited rank displayed itself, and, overruled the nobler sentiment.  "No, sir!" she cried, " your unworthy intended bride cannot enter vmy society, nor in any way be recognized by me, no matter how serious may be the consequen- ces." "Nor by me," joined Sir William, sharply. "But," said the son, " you have never asked what are the virtues of the girl I have selected! You have never asked a word about her piety, beauty, accomplish- me'nts,  " "Accomplishments!" shrieked Mrs. Colborn, inter- rupting him.  W What do you suppose I wish to know about the low creature?." And completely forgetting herself, she flew past him across the room, crying pas-; sionately, "Out of my sight! leave the house I your presence here contaminates me," "Yes!"' joined the general, "you are a thorn in my flesh! disgusting in my sight! and from this hour I wish to see you no more." "Why do you not obey?" shrieked his angry mother. "Because you are my parents," said he calmly," and 10   202      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, as I love you, I shall not heed you when you treat me thus harshy!" "Treat you harshy!" cried the general, " we are treating you too kindly; but yo'u are treating us harsh- ly. We certainly mean what we say! Go!" "We do mean it!" cried Mrs. Colborn, and go from our sight at once. You have made me wretched." "Then," said William, with a sigh, "I see I must de- part-and so soon, too, after my return!"And he walked out of the room. But as his figure disappeared through the door, all the woman returned to his mother again, and fearing her son had gone from her forever, she fell into the arnils of her daughter and sobbed aloud, "Oh! Melissa! William will break my heart! Run after him! Call him back!" Melissa left the room, and caught him by the arm. "Come back, brother! mother wishes you to do so. She is the most wretched of beings. Come back to -her!" The heart of William beat lightly at this announce- ment, and he hastened back into the presence of his parents., As he entered, his mother, weeping as if some great calamity had taken place, and his proud father, moody, stern, and silent, caused him to think that his dear Kate had proved a prophetess when she said that there would be much trouble caused by their attach- ment to each other. But her image thus casually cross- ing his mind gave him new courage; and with a firm step he walked to the center of the drawing-room, and stood as if waiting to be addressed. His dark eyes rested upon his mother, expressive of commingled regret, respect, and resolution. "It grieves me much, dear mother," at length he said, "to see you thus mourn." i   OR THE DISINHERITED.    203 But the arrogant woman would not yield to, the promptings of her nobler nature, and rush into his arms. No! the thought of what she termed his almost unpar- donable crime was uppermost in her mind, and she made him no reply. At length Melissa, touched by the scene, although approving thb conduct of her parents, essayed to inter- rupt the doleful silence. She advanced towards him, placed her arm upon his shoulder, touched his marble- like forehead with a gentle kiss, and said, "Dear broth- er! this trouble in our family I greatly regret. There is poor mother, whose heart is breaking, and-father, whose mind is tormented with your conduct; and I mourning that you should bring such ruin upon your- self and all of us--all would beg of you to think of i this affair inr the light of common sense; to weigh the obstacles to such a union carefully, and with your bet- ter judgment. Do so, dear brother, and you can but be convinced that you ought to do as we advise you." William did not change a muscle or move a limb, but when she had finished her appeal, he asked, calmly, if she loved George North. Melissa calmly answered that she did, but requested that he would not use Mr. North's name at all. "How do you expect to succeed," asked William, , in allaying this tumult, if I am to be debarred from illustrating my position?" "I wish I could accomplish it,"- said she, "by con- vincing you that you are jeopardizing your own as well as our happiness." "IfI have committed errors, in your estimation," said her brother, "you have also committed the same in mine." "What errors?" asked Melissa, removing her arm   204       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, from his shoulder, with a haughty toss of the head. "What errors have I committed?" "Do you love George North, Maelissa?"And as he spoke he fixed upon .her a look expressive of doubt as to the state of her affections. Her eyes fell to the carpet, and she answered in a faint voice, "I do." "You do love ahim," resumed her brother, " for his wealth, family, and rank; but not for his personal ap- pearance or mental qualities. You have no more love for him than you have for either of the many gentlemen of rank with whom you are acquainted; and yet, you have promised him your hand, and of course your heart, and have told him you love him. Now, how can you love him when, as I know, your heart is in the posses- sion of another? Do you understand me, Melissa?" Her head dropped upon her bosom, and she turned away. "It seems I have wounded your feelings," said Wil- liam, "but it was far from my wish to do so, but you forced me to it." She walked slowly to a seat, murmuring, "Such are the ungrateful thanks I receive for interceding to make a reconciliation." "You should not have accused me of chmmitting errors unless you are willing to hear of your own" said William. The general here interposed. "This conversation," said he, "only makes things worse. Let us come to an understanding. Your moth- er, sister, relatives, friends, and myself, are bitterly op- posed to the reception of such a person as an inn-keep- er's daughter into our family. Now, William, I wish to know if, in opposition to all our wishes, you still con-   OR THE DISINHERiTED.     205 tinue determined to'connect yourself with such a de- testable family?i" "Family! father!" said William, "I do not wish to marry the family, I only wish the daughter! It is with her I expect to live; her to protect and love; and not her family. But, to be more explicit, I believe a man is the best judge of what will please himself; that he ought to know whom he fancies, and tiat, having se- lected one to please himself, he should marry her, no matter how much such/ a step will displease others. And as I have selected mine, and am of age, I shall do so." "' You are a  fool," said the general, in a rage. aIrs. Colborn gave a deep groan, and rang the bell for a servant, and Melissa burst into tears. * The announcement here of George North put an end to this disagreeable. scene. As he entered, Sir William and his lady left the apartment. s    I North advanced to Melissa, as she arose to receive him, and planted a kiss upon her lips, which she coldly returned. William thought how very different would this have been, had both loved with the devotedness that charac- terized the affection between himself and his Kate! There they stood, -like lifeless statues, casting cold glances at each other, having impatiently hurried over a cold embrace that circumstances had forced upon them!  After a word or two addressed to North, he excused himself, and left them to their formal and affected inter- view, and ascended to his chamber. He threw himself carelessly into a chair, with his elbow resting upon a stand, his hand supporting his head, and was soon lost in deep thought. 1-.,   206      LIUTfiNANT COLBORN, A gentle tap at the door awoke him from his reverie, and he called out "Come in," when lo! his mother en- tered, and closing the door, took the seat he had placed for her beside him. "My son, I acknowledge that your father and myself have been carried away by passion, and have said many things in our excitement that we would not have said had we been more composed; but the case is aggravat- ing in the extreme. I have come to you now to have a little conversation, wholly devoid of passion." "This opportunity is what I have been wishing for, dear mother," said he, "in order to show you some reason for my plebeian selection." "You are aware," said his mother, "that your fa- ther's family and mine are amongst the first in London and Devonshire, and for a century back have so ranked. No pains or expense have been spared on your educa- tion, and by your superior attainments and your father's influence, you have been advanced to a high station in theonavy-for one of your age--and bid fair to be promoted still -higher. Melissa is to connect us with the noble family of North, that even to William the Conqueror trace back their lineage. You, my son, with all these advantages, could demand the hand of nearly any lady in England. You have been often spoken of to Melissa by young ladies of her acquaintance in such a way as to show that they are interested in you. More than one has hinted this to her quite plainly; and one of the most charming girls of our acquaintance spoke to me the othersday about you, and asked, in a manner showing a lively interest in the information, when you were expected home. If you would, my dear Willie, recall your usual good sense, and solicit the hand of one of these, you might enhance your position and standing   OR THE DISINHERITED.     207 in society, which are already enviable, as you are the direct heir to the rank and wealth of your honored father." ' The standing of the family, dear mother, as I -have said before, if so very high, cannot be injured by my marriage even with one far beneath me." ( It is impossible, my son, to stoop so low without in- jury to ourselves." "Would you not be willing," asked William, ' to sac- rifice a little of your wishes in regard to family stand- ing, to promote my pleasure and happiness still more?," I cannot conceive," said she, " how stooping far be- low one's level, with the consequent loss of self-respect which must follow, can in any way promote one's hap: piness." "' Do you not believe in love, mother? In that mys- serious passion that attracts beings of opposite sexes to each other?" "I do," she replied, "( but know not why one should descend so low, when there are equal if not superior attractions in a higher class." , Because, dear mother, destiny--only another name for divine will--creates our likes and dislikes, and knowing no difference of rank or position in society, it is quite as likely to bring about attachments between persons far -differently circumstanced in life, as if their advantages were in all things the same." "'What is she like?" asked Mrs. Colborn, sarcastic- ally; "what are the wonderful charms she possesses, that not one of all your numerous acquaintances who have had the advantage of aristocratic life, can vie with her?" "Dear mother, I cannot express myself, but this much I know, I love her more dearly than any object; and if   208      LIEUTSNANT COLBOBRN  I am deprived of her, I shall be the most miserable man in existence." ' But if," returned his mother, , I should introduce to you a lady just as fair and lovely as she is, could you not love her?" "I am sure I could not -there is no other just like her, none half so chairming;" and as he spoke he placed his hand over his brow, and became lost in thinking of her he loved. How long he remained in this state of reverie he knew not, but when his hand fell from his brow, and he looked for his mother, she was gone. Mrs. Colborn informed her husband of her interview with their son, and that he still opposed their wishes. "Now," continued she, " as he appears to love the girl very dearly, and declares that he will be miserable without her, I think we had better throw him into gay society; introduce him to many young ladies he has never yet seen; and perhaps some one will possess those wonderful peculiarities that are necessary to command his fancy and love." "A capital idea," said Sir William; "let us give a party at once --yes, two or three - and no doubt, his mind will become drawn from this Miss What-is-her- name.': Melissa was informed of her parents' intentions im- mediately, and acquiesced in the wisdom of the sug- gested arrangements. "I," said she, " can select from my circle of acquaint- ance young ladies who would win the heart of the cold- est and most indifferent man in existence. There is Ellen, the pretty brunette belle, will surely endeavor to win his heart; and as so many young men have already been captivated by her charms, I doubt not Willie will ,       J   on THE DISINHERITED.      209 be. But if she fails to win him, the lovely Arabella will surely succeed. And there are many other girls of my acquaintance who will be powerful rivals to his an- gel Kate, as he calls her. An inn-keeper's daughter! to be named in comparison with such ladies as these! Nonsense!" "Arabella is pretty," said Mrs. Colborn, delighted with what her daughter had said; " and so young and rich, too! Do not fail to send cards to the proud Sur- reys!" "Ellen is my favorite," said the general. "She is very lovely, and I declare I cannot see how any young man can avoid becoming desperately enamored of her at first sight. I do not think Willie can refrain from loving her. Do not fail to send cards to -the family of Sir James." ( The young men do love her, father," said Melissa. ' I reallv do not know how many she has captivated, and then refused to accept in matrimony. Hence she is called a coquette." "My word for it," proudly said Sir William, " that she will not refuse our Willie! No,he is too fine a man to be refused by any lady of sense." ' I hope you will not be disappointed, father," said Melissa-and perfectly delighted, she ran away to in- form her brother. William was walking the parlor floor in deep reflec- tion when his sister entered. ; I have not come, dear brother, to annoy you with allusions to the disagreeable subject of the morning, but to bring you good news," said she, while a smile played about her pretty mouth. "What good news-?" he asked, the thought flashing IO0   210      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, across his mind that his parents had succumbed to his wishes. "We are to have a large party,'! she replied. "Oh! is that all?" he carelessly asked-and resumed his walk. "It is true," she said, " that it is not near so much as we would like to do in honor of your return, but as it is now out of yachting and hunting season, we cannot think of any better plan of entertaining you. Yet we in- tend to make up the want of other means of amusement, if possible, by giving parties and dinners. We are de- termined to make you happy while you remain on shore. Lord North has invited us to dine with them nest week, and the occasion is to end in a large evening party. There is a ball to come off at Cousin Baxter's, and others will follow in succession, on account of your and Mr. North's arrival honle. It will be truly a gay season within the circle of the two families, as all are very anxious to welcome your return." "I presume," said William, " that the whole will con- clude with a grand wedding, as yourself and George North will, of course, be called upon shortly to elevate the standing of the family." Melissa cast upon him a look of anger, but the pleas- ing thought of the gay festivities in prospect,' probably to end as he had suggested, neutralized the,sting of his sarcasm, and she resumed her good nature. "Are you not glad, Willie, that we are to be made so happy throughout this gay season'?" , I am pleased," he replied, " to think yozu are to be ,made happy by these gay festivities and your union with George North; but, alas! the case will be very different with me!! And my feelings are wounded when s ,    '     OR THE DISINHERITED.     2" I think that my sister willingly contributes towards my wretchedness." "How so?" cried Melissa, in surprise. "By assisting our parents in refusing their consent to receive my dear Kate as a daughter." "I have done only what I thought would be for-your good, dear brother, and you certainly ought not to cen- sure me for that. I hope we shall be able to make you happy throughout this gay season." "When is the first party to come off?" asked William. "As soon as possible, for mother and father are very anxious to cheer you; to lift you from the state of des- pondency you appear to be in; and to encourage you to be high-spirited and lively asformerly! Come, dear Willie, be as you used to be, and throw aside these de- jected feelings." "I hope you will enjoy the gay scenes about to take place," said William, " but as for me, I shall be a cipher among those who attend. I shall never be happy until I can call my dear Kate my lawful wife." I I hope to make you happy yet," said Melissa, "-with- out such a sacrifice;" and singing a line of a favorite air, she skipped out of the room. The invitation cards were duly sent to a great num- ber of relations, friends, and acquaintances. The gen- eral, Mrs. Colborn, and Melissa conversed much upon the subject of the parties, and George North being in- formed of the plan to win William from Kate and unite him to a lady of rank, entered heartily into it. Indeed, Sir William and his family so busied themselves in the preparations, that they forgot all their late gloomy an- ticipations about their sonr and in their imagination only saw him the admired of all admirers in the festive throng, and the successful suitor of some lady of high family and inexhaustible affluence.   212      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER XXIIIo f A?E JE,- THE GRAND PARTY. The day at length arrived'for the assemblage of the expected party. The sun left an unusually pellucid fir- mament, as i ound and red he disappeared beneath the horizon. Here and there a passing, fleecy cloud might be seen, leisurely sailing before the moderate north wind. Other clouds were settled down to the horizon, but so very differently formed that their heads, or peaks, might be taken for hills or mountains upon the land, or islets upon the sea. It was still winter, but the long spell of boisterous weather had passed away. The atmosphere, so long damp and depressing, now became dry and bracing; and the ground, that had been soft and muddy, now be- came hard and frozen. The last light of day disappeared, and myriads of heavenly orbs shone far down to our, planet's surface, glittering and sparkling through the transparent atmos- phere. The moon, then in her perigee, soon began to light the eastern sky, and seen through the retiring clouds, appeared like the conflagration of some distant build- ing, when the flames are shooting forth from window, door, chimney, and roof, and sending light far around and high above the neighboring roofs. Bright and still brighter became the sky at her ap- proach. Dim and still more obscure the surrounding   '-8      OR THE DISINHERITED.      213 stars as she advanced above the hills. Presently, burst- \ ing into full view, she threw her illuminating rays over hill and dale, creating tall shadows among the trees, hedges, statues, arbors, summer-seats, and other objects. Such was the scene without-and brilliant was the appearance within the mansion of Sir William, on the evening of the party. Carriage after carriage drove up the lawn- the footmen let down their steps, and gen- tlemen assisted ladies to alight, and followed them into the mansion, where they were gracefully received. The large chandeliers and numbers of waxen can- dles threw their brilliant rays over those vast halls and magnificently furnished rooms, where costly earpets were pressed by the feet of ladies and gentlemen, com- posing one of the most select, grand, and aristocratic parties that had ever assembled in England. Many of the guests were the very elite of the British nobility; and had the hopes of the Colborns been realized that evening, Williamrn must have selected a lady of rank, for none others were present. Ladies most elegantly attired, glittering in silks, sat- ins, and diamonds; 'military men in full dress; civilians in plain black, with white vests and cravats, mingling gracefully with each other in the mazy dance, to the lively and harmonious strains of the finest music, or seated in groups in different parts of the vast rooms, presented truly a fairy scene. Among the ladies, conspicuous was Arabella, only daughter of the Earl of Surrey, a light-hearted, lovely girl of scarcely eighteen springs; she was of medium height and well proportioned. Her large eyes were of a dark hazel, yet so bright that none but a close ob- server would have taken them to be other than black. Her face was oval, features regular, and forehead high,   "EUTENANT COLBORN,) full, and of marble smoothness; her hair was black, profuse, and in massy braids brought around her per- fectly shaped head, formed a coronet, which was simply ornamented with white japonicas, fresh from the hot- house. She was dressed in a simple India muslin, the web-like texture of which must have cost the labor of a life-time of some poor native.  Her beautifully formed neck and arms were adorned with pearls, and a cluster of flowers drooped over her expanded bosom. She was, without doubt, and yet unconsciously, the most lovely girl in the assembly. Her mother had spoken to her about William, and as he passed, in earnest conversation with a young lady, she asked in a whisper, but with much earnestness, if "that noble-looking young man" was he. Noble-looking indeed he appeared as he promenaded the rooms, in the full-dress uniform of a lieutenant in his majesty's navy. There was something about the turn of his features, the expression of his eyes, and the natural gracefulness of his manners, that distinguished him among the crowds of fashionables around him. He moved among the gay ladies and gentlemen in a grace- ful manner, and as he bowed with that ease known only to a true gentleman, now to a lady of rank, and now to a peer of England, none, unaware of the fact, would have supposed that aught but joyousness had a place in his heavy heart. Ellen, youngest daughter of the Right Honorable Sir James Lester, M. P., sat by the side of Melissa, in earnest conversation, displaying her brilliant wit, and joking her about the very aristocratic and wealthy George North. She also was a very pretty lady, and among the gen-   OR THE DISINHERITED.          215 tlemen bore the appellation of belle. She was tall and queenly, -and. as I have, said before, a brunette. Her dress of amber-colored satin well became her complex- ion. She was, however, a confirmed coquette. William approached his sister, and after a formal in- troduction to Ellen, he offered her his arm for a prome- nade. As they moved through the crowd, conversing and smiling gaily, one would have supposed that he was very much taken with his new acquaintance. Sir William looked with pride and joy at his son as Ellen, leaning upon his arm, cast into his face those conquering smiles that had never failed to bring one or other of her admirers to her feet; but the conquest was reversed in this instance, and unconsciously and unin- tentionally William had enkindled the flame of love in her heart. And could his dear Kate have looked in upon them, and seen the fond and lingering glances that were cast upon him by different ones of the fair sex, and particu- larly by the beautiful Ellen, had there been a spark of the green-eyed monster in her composition it must have been aroused. William did not remain long with Ellen, for as soon as politeness would admit, he left her and glided along in search of some new pleasure to overcome, if possible, the often-repeated sighs that were forced from his breast. The lovely and modest Arabella had noticed his at- tentions to other ladies, and a feeling of jealousy flashed across her mind, in spite of her exertions to repress it, as he promenaded with one or danced with another. Yet she feared, as her eyes sought a sight of his ap- proaching or receding figure, that he would not come to her.  216       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, At last, however, he, accompanied by George North, approached her. An introduction took place, which--- although she knew not why -brought the crimson to her modest face. William seated himself beside her, and as he viewed the features and form of that beautiful girl, he imme- diately acknowledged in his own mind that she was decidedly the most lovely and charming girl that he had ever yet beheld, excepting one. In fact, she reminded him of Kate; the expression of their eyes was very similar-in consequence of which he soon became much more pleased with her society than with that of any other person in the assembly. They soon joined theedance, and as they gracefully moved over the floor, it was remarked that they were the finest couple in the room. The dance being over, they promenaded up and down the drawing-room, keeping up a sprightly and pleasant conversation. Time passed on, and William appeared to enjoy her company so well, that Mrs. Colborn was perfectly delighted, and remarked to her daughter she was of opinion that William had become enamored of Arabella. "He is pleased with her, no doubt," said Melissa; "and she also appears to be well pleased with him." The eyes of Mrs. Colborn assumed a very pleasant expression, as she already fancied their house united with the proud Surreys. While crowds of guests moved towards the banquet hall, Arabella leaned upon William's arm; at the tables, which were bountifully loaded with rare delicacies and costly viands, he waited upon her, and more than one young man looked upon him with envy, as they marked the modest smiles of the pretty Arabella cast fondly   .  .    OR THE DISINHERITED.      217 upon him. In truth, it almost seemed a pity that those smiles, which would have caused so much happiness in others, were thrown away on him; yet such was the case, for even she could not win him from his beloved Kate. It was long past midnight when the carriages were again drawn up to receive the guests. In good time all had departed, and quietude again reigned through the lordly dwelling. As the family of Sir William assembled to a late breakfast on the following morning, all seemed to be in high spirits, for the youthful and rich Arabella, they were sure, had won the affections of William. The. general, unusually sociable, spoke of the dance, prome- nade, and gay party, with as much interest as Would a young man of twenty-five. Airs. Colborn was very pleasant. In fact, persons of such willful passions are generally very smooth and pleasing when good-natured. Melissa smiled, and looking at her brother, said, that from the, marked attention shown to Arabella at the party, that she thought he had become taken with her. "She is truly a charming girl," said William, " and far superior to most other ladies. She is well informed on general subjects, converses sensibly, and is not alto- gether given to small-talk, as is too often the case with young ladies." Xelissa smiled, and Sir William and his lady ex- changed satisfactory glances. "I fancied, however," said the general, " that Wil- liami's attentions were directed towards my favorite, the daughter of Sir James." "I beg to differ with you, dear father," said William. "She is too light, artful, conceited, and is not a superior person at all."1    218      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Mrs. Colborn smiled, saying, "I think, as William does, that Arabella is far superior to the other. She certainly is a lovely girl, and a great prize, as she will be an amiable and worthy lady." "I was quite sure," said Melissa, "that Arabella would captivate Willie's heart; she is so very charming and modest, that it would have been almost impossible for him to have met her, confersed, danced, and prome- naded with her, without deciding to seek her hand." "I am quite sure," said William, with a smile, " that I could converse, danqp, and promenade with her many times without losing my heart, supposing I had it to lose."' "Oh! do not endeavor to turn it off that way," said Melissa, laughing. " for I noticed your marked atten- tions to her, and could easily perceive that you were very much in love with her; and her actions showed the love was reciprocated." "What!" exclaimed William, "you really surprise me! I hope she did not think as you do, sister, for I can assure you that my attentions to her were not in- tended to create such an idea. Can a gentleman not converse, dance, or promenade with a lady at a ball without compromising himself? What do we go to balls for, but to enjoy ourselves in such ways together?" A degree of sadness instantly took the place of the pleasant look on the face of Mrs. Colborn, for she well knew that what her son had said he meant. The general looked at his son sharply, and showed quite plainly that he was displeased. Melissa cast upon him a doubtful look, saying, "I cannot believe you, Willie; I think you are jesting." Sir William and his lady arose from the table with far different feelings from those they had lately enjoyed; the candid remarks of William had brought back their   OR- THE DISINHERITED.     219 former gloomy feelings. But yet they intended to per- severe in endeavoring to turn him from, what they termed, his perverse ways, and no better mode could be suggested than to continue to keep him constantly in ladies' society, by bringing about gay parties and balls. The grand dinner at Lord North's was followed by a ball of great splendor. Another was soon given at their cousin Baxter's, and for some time gay entertain- ments were continued, each new one eclipsing all that preceded it. Old and young seemed to enjoy them equally, and it was often remarked that the two youthful officers of the Race Horse were being honored in an extraordinary manner. But it was only known by a very few what was the real object of so many gorgeous entertainments, and it seemed to them to be a pity that so much pains and expense should have been used in vain. r \  -   t   *   220       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER XXIV. THE DISINHERITING. A cessatiorntof these festivities at last took place, and the numerous aristocratic and gay pleasure-seekers were contented to remain quiet for some time. William, concluding that his parents could not in justice com- plain-after the three weeks' visit-if he absented himself from Mount Prospect for a short time, made up his mind to leave. He dreaded, however, to introduce the subject to them, fearing they would very naturally ask him whither he intended to go, and as he would be obliged to tell them the truth, he was very well aware that there would be another troublesome scene between them and himself. However, Kate/he must see, he was quite uneasy about her, as he had received letters from her (in answer to several he had written), and she had inti- mated that he was far happier with his aristocratic friends than witfi the inn-keeper's daughter. Although she did not openly complain, yet he could read her feelings in every letter. He could not, did not censure her, but on the contrary, admired and loved her for her affection for him thus proved. And it was not strange that :Kate should feel so, after reading his descriptions of those magnificent entertainments. William entered the parlor, where sat his parents and sister. He dreaded to inform them -of his intention. "But I must," said he to himself, "for Kate is unhap-   OR THE DISINHERITED.     221 py! I must, I will go to her at once, in order to con- vince her that I love her, and to remove from her mind those gloomy forebodings. I have written enough to assure her of my love, and have all along presumed that my statements would remove such unpleasant feel- ings from her mind, but it seems by her last letter that she feels worse than ever. She loves me, the dear crea- ture, and it is not strange that she should be anxious about me. I'll go to'her at once." "I shall not be able," commenced William, " toattend the next party, as I must leave for a short time." "Where are you going, Willie?" asked his mother in a tone, which, although kind, showed that some un- pleasant suspicion lurked within her bosom. William had been looking directly at his mother, but now dropped his eyes as he replied, "To Plymouth." Mrs. Colborn gave a deep-drawn sigh. The general arose, and thrusting his hands into the pockets of his dress-coat, commenced walking up and down the room. Melissa turned half around on her chair, and looked thoughtfully at the window. "Have you received orders," asked the general in a sarcastic manner, " to return to your duty so soon?" "I have not, sir." ", Then I presume you are going to visit that low bar- maid?" William's feelings were wounded by; the cruel man- ner in which his father had spoken. He became quite out of temper, but governed himself when he remem- bered that he was his parent. He looked first at his father, then at his mother, and by their angry looks knew he was about to receive a gust that he dreaded   222      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, far more than a hurricane at sea. He resolved to meet it manfully, however, and began by saying, "I am not aware that it is incumbent on a man twenty-five years of age, to give an explanation of the why and wherefore he goes from one place to another, but yet as you ask me so peremptorily, I will answer that I am going to visit Plymouth for the purpose you suggest." "Indeed!" ejaculated Mrs. Colborn sarcastically, "we had hoped from appearances that you had con- eluded to abandon your plebeian selection, and solicit the hand of Arabella." "That, mother, has never been my intention." ' Do not mother me," cried Mrs. Colborn in a rage, did any one ever witness anything half so insulting as to mother me after such unnatural treatment?" and ris- ing from her seat she walked hastily past her son, cast- ing on him a look of contempt. i But if you would allow me even half a privilege to defend my conduct," implored William, as he burst into tears, "if you would but allow yourselves to see the person I have selected, to listen to her pure and noble sentiments, and to know how excellent is her character, how sweet her disposition, you would surely like her, and could not possibly object to allowing me my heart's choice." "Do you seriously intend to visit her now, in the midst of our festivities, got up specially on your ac- count?" demanded Sir William in an angry tone. "I consider that I am bound in honor, as by my in- clination, so to do," replied William calmly. Melissa burst into tears; she well knew that her par- ents were now becoming more and more enraged, and that a serious quarrel was inevitable.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     223 ct It is useless to listen any longer to such a foolish, stupid wretch," cried Mrs. Colborn in a passion, " and to shorten the affair, I wish'it understood that I shall no longer recognize him as my son." "William!'" said his father in a firm voice, "if you persist in this willfiu disobedience, I shall cast you off from my title and fortune forever. Will you abandon that low creature, or not?'9 a I shall never abandon my betrothed wife," replied William, " no matter what may be the consequence." "Then, sir," said the general, " since you will crush our pride, and treat our exertions to save you from fall- ing into the lowest society, with perfect indifference; since you refuse to yield to the persuasion and tears of your affectionate mother; the entreaties of an only and beloved sister, and the good advice of an indulgent father, who is ready and willing to do all in his power to promote your welfare; I forever cut you off from the heirship and honorable title of the house of Colborn, Go your own way! Leave us, and no longer disgrace and contaminate these walls! Go from Mkount Prospect forever! You are no longer our son! I disinherit you forever!" William's manly face turned ashy pale at those cruel  and unnatural words, and he cast his eyes towards his mother in hopes of some sympathy. But alas! he was doomed to disappointment, for as his glance met her cold and unfeeling look, she cruelly Said, "And I sanc- tion your father's decision." William, now completely unmanned, fell upon his knees before the woman who had fondled him in in- fancy, watched with interest his every desire, looked upon him with pride as her only boy, and since in man. hood, as the prop, hope, and pride of the family.   r224 LMUTEtU'NANT COLPI]BORN. He implored her by the love she had once borne him, to intercede with his father to recall the words that he had uttered. "Dear mother," he cried, "I am not answerable for the emotions and sentiments the Creator has implanted within me. The girl you despise I met and loved almost instantly. I can be truly happy with her, and with no other. I cannot unite myself to either of the ladies you wish me - although I acknowledge they are lovely and worthy--because my heart is in the possession of another. Will you continue to make your son unhappy? Dear mother, will you cast me off? Will you throw away your son, your own son, your only son, because he loves a person you do not like, and yet have never seen? Do not, I beg of you, turn me away, persuade father to recall the awful sentences that have cursed his own son. Oh! say not that I am to be thrust out of doors an outcast! Not for the sake of the heir. ship do I plead--for that I do not care; not for title and rank--they have long since been banished from my wishes, but for the sake of the love I bear you all, . for the sake of the natural attachment I have for home! dear home!" The proud spirit of Mrs. Colborn quailed before her son's powerful and touching pleading, and for an instant her hard heart was pierced; but forming a new resolu- tion, she said firmly, "My determination is unaltered." William, wishing to appeal once more to the heart of his mother, before he left them forever, continued, "Beloved mother! it is from yourself that I have in- herited my nature. And as you reared me from infancy, am I wholly to blame for what you call a foolish freak? Furthermore, you must acknowledge that it: is destiny that has ordered my selection, and yet in/opposition to   OR THE DISINHERITED.     225 your own belief, you condemn me to a punishment that is worse than slavery." The general turned pale'at these last words, for no matter how solicitous he was in maintaining his rank in society, he was a great believer in destiny, and thle words of his son sank deep into his heart. But the idea of a family connection with such low, people brought back his former determination, and he bade his son de- part, unless he would accede to their wishes. His mother, too, remained unaltered in her decision. Any other woman would have at least granted his often repeated request, of allowing him to introduce his in- tended wife, that a perception of her good qualities might, in some- degree, atone -for her low birth. But no, she would not listen to it, and in spite of his many appeals to her feelings from his wounded, bleeding heart, she turned aside from her only son with unnatur- al and cruel contempt. He arose, and walked slowly away, but on reaching the door he turned, and cast upon his parents an implor- ing look, hoping that they would repent, or at least give him a parting word of kindness. But no, the accursed love of rank had filled their hearts, crushing out every noble feeling! Melissa, however, could not let him go without one token of affection. She sprang towards him, and em- braced him with a sister's love. No parents, unless pos- sessing hearts as hard as adamant, could have looked upon their only children, as they thus clung together and sobbed as, if their hearts would break, without having some slight emotions of regret for the misery they were causing. But alas! the cold hearts of Sir William and his wife were not touched, and they allowed him to depart with- "   226      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, out one kind word, one parting shake of the hand. He took his hat, cane, and coat, and planting a farewell kiss upon the lips of Melissa,-walked through the hall, and while half a dozen fine horses stood in the stables, pro- ceeded on foot down the road. As he reached the brink of the hill, where, the last view of the mansion was to be had, he stopped and buttoned up his overcoat and -put oni his gloves, to protect him from the cold and "\ piercing air of winter, and cast a glance at the parlor windows, hoping his parents would be touched and call him back. But no window was raisied to allow of the wave of a handkerchief; no servant appeared to say he was wanted at the house; and with a heavy heart lhe turned and walked -as far as the lodge. "John," said he, " you have always been kind to me, so take this little present, for you will see me no more," and as he spoke he handed him a piece of gold and dis- appeared. After four days' journey he arrived at Plymouth. He hurried on to meet the only one he really and truly believed to be a friend. It was late when he reached the inn, and entered the little parlor. It did not compare with the magnificent drawing-room of Mount Prospect, but yet it. had a far happier look to him, and when the graceful figure of Kate entered to meet him, he rushed forward to embrace her, and bursting into tears, exclaimed, "My own Kate, I feel as if you are the only friend I have in the world." Kate caressed him, and asked why he came to her in so much anxiety of mind. "Oh! I am an outcast," he cried, "I am disinher- ited!" But we will allow them to remain together undis-   OR THE DISINHERITED.     227 turbed, for such scenes are too sacred for the sight of a third party. That very day a letter had been placed in the hands of Mr, Pederson, which read as follows: MOUNT PROSPECT, Jan. -, 179-. MR. GEiORGE PEDE RSON, SIR:--It is with painful emotions that I write this epistle, as my son William intends to rarry your daughter without my consent. I do not wish in any way to wound your feelings, but, as the respective posi- tions of our families are widely diverse in society, and as there are many other reasons which make the pro- posed union objectionable, I beg you will oppose the same with your utmost power. Yours most truly, -SIR WILLIAM COLBORN.   228      LIEU'TENANT COLBORNg CHAPTER XXV. THE PREPARATION FOR MARRIAGE. Kate listened to her lover's narrative with painful anxiety, for although she had predicted that there would be much trouble at Mount Prospect, yet she did not think his parents would have so cruelly driven him from their doors. She wept for having been the innocent cause of inflicting such pangs on William's heart, and would willingly have transferred the trouble to her own, and relieved him of the pain. She consoled him with her caresses, and in kind language said she hoped they 6Twould yet be happy, as in almost all instances of the kind, reconciliation and forgiveness had in the end been brought about. Kate was not a person to give way to difficulties; she had no idea of allowing any obstacle, no matter how great, to deprive her of the man she loved; and however much his parents might disapprove of their betrothal, it had no effect on her determination. But her father having received the letter of which the reader is cognizant, from Sir William Colborn, and as he had not previously approved of his daughter's choice, now formed a resolution to break up the match, and bring about one between her and the gentlemanly Mr. Carey, "Mr. Pederson," said Colborn respectfully, as they were seated' alone in the sitting-room, "I have been paying my addresses to your worthy daughter, and as you are aware, have won her heart."   OR THE DISINHERITED.     229 Mr. Pederson closed the half-open door. "I have met with much opposition," continued the lieutenant, " on the part of my parents, but I still ad- here to my resolution, and they have cruelly disinher- itqd me." A Is it possible?" exclaimed Mr. Pederson in astonish- ment. it It is, sir; and yet I bear up under the pressure as well as can be expected, as your daughter consoles me in my grief, and with her composed and easy manner of meeting trouble, has almost taught me at times to -forget it. I have come to you now, and although re- gretting that I have to bring with me the name of out- cast, make bold to supplicate you for the hand of your daughter, whom I love as dearly as my life." Mr. Pederson, for reasons already well known to the reader, was not at all prepared to grant William's re- quest. "Mr. Colborn," said he, "to permit my daughter to accept in matrimony the man her heart has chosen, has been and still is my intention, but as your parents are bitterly opposed to the union, I think you had better patiently think the subject over, and wait till you can obtain their approval."  t "That I am sure I can never do." "Do you not think it is wrong to disobey your par- ents?" "Not when they demand of me what is unjust and cruel." ' Allow me to talk to you just as your father would," said Mr. Pederson in a kind manner. "I wish my father had spoken to me half as kind," thought William. "You have become enamored of my Kate, and no a/    230      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, doubt are very happy in her society, very mtch pleased to loobk upon her and imagine her yours. Such is the case with almost all young men in like circumstances, and in fact it often happens that they fancy one, two, or three pretty girls before they make their selections for wives. Then they look back and say, ' How stupid I was to love Miss -, or Miss -, for now I care noth- ing about either of them.' Now I have no doubt but this will be your case exactly, particularly as you can boast of so many advantages. Besides, -when you get older, when molve substantial aims and aspirations fill your breast than light love, you will regret the step you now wish to take. I am certain it would be better for you to obey your parents." "They have disinherited me, sir, and turned me out of doors." "No doubt they take it very much at heart,9 said Mr. Pederson, "and not without cause. People at fifty have more experience. in these matters than those at twenty-five, and a just allowance should be made for their views." "I admit it," said William respectfully, " and also hold that there ought to be a just allowance made for the passions of the human heart; but my parents make no such allowance, all they care for is self-aggrandize- ment and rank." "I would kindly advise you," said Mr. Pederson, " to return to your parents, and converse with them on the subject." "And if they should say - as I am sure they would - that they would not recognize me unless I abandoned your daughter - what should I say?" "(Reason with them," answered Mr. Pederson, " and if they still withhold their consent, be a dutiful son and obey them." - *t   OR THE DISINHERITED.     231 "They will not reason," returned William, "' all their talk and arguments are based on family interest; and for me to sacrifice my dear Kate, and make both of us wretched, I can not." "Then I know not what to say," said Mr. Pederson. u' It is certainly hard to refuse my child her happiness, on the one hand; and wrong to cause unhappiness in your family, and my own future -dissatisfaction, on the other." "There is no reasonable cause why my union with your daughter should cause feelings of regret in the bosoms of members of my father's family, and I do not see how it can in any way cause you future discontent- ment; then such a step would enhance your daughter's happiness, and this, since she is your only remaining child, should naturally be your chief object in life." Still -Mr. Pederson would not give his consent, but continued to advise him to return to his parents. William, becoming dejected from meeting with so much opposition, remained in silent thought for a few minutes, and then said,      ? "It appears that fate is against me! I was opposed in this matter by my parents bitterly, and notwithstand- ing I argued, persuaded, and upon my bended knees begged, they coldly refused my request, and turned- me from them. Then I came to you, sir, but alas! you  would send me back to my cruel parents, ,although I repeatedly tell you there is no hope there. Even you refuse to grant my request, and the dearest wish of your only daughter. Oh Kate!' he continued, "were you not left, I should indeed be a friendless man! I'll go to her for that consolation that all others refuse." He left the apartment, and shortly afterwards Kate entered.   32      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, )I " Kate," said Mr. Pederson, " I have received this let- ter from Sir William Colborn," and he handed it to her. Having finishedreading it, she remarked that William had informed her all about the matter. " This annoys me very much," said Mr. Pederson. "What does, father ?" " This intended marriage." "Then you are more anxious," said Kate, " to pro- mote the interests and happiness of strangers than of your daughter." This was an argument the old gentleman could hardly oppose. " Do not think, dear child, that I am not interested in your welfare, for I am, but my principal objection is, that I fear if you should be united with Mr. Colborn, you would be lost to me forever. " Dear father !" she sobbed, as she enfolded his neck in her arms, "can you possibly think I would for- sake you ? or that I would no longer love you ? Think not that because I love William, all the love I have borne you is transferred to him ? Harbor not such a thought! I love you all the more for loving him; nev- er let such cruel ideas enter your head, dear father, for I will never forsake you, nor leave you alone." " My noble child," cried he, clasping her to his heart, " since you speak so sincerely and earnestly, I am con- vinced on that point; but inasmuch as a sbn owes a duty of obedience to his parents., I appeal to your good principle, and ask if Mr. Colborn's disobedience ought to be encouraged ?" ' I approve, dear father, of such obedience, when it is consistent with what is just and reasonable, and does not interfere with the future happiness of others.

But his parents, without listening to his appeals and reasons, have disinherited him, and driven him from their home an outcast. Under these cruel circumstances, can you censure me, dear father, for .clinging to him, as a friend, a lover, a promised wife clinging' to him as my dear departed mother would have clung to you, had your circumstances been simi- lar ?" Mr. Pederson was touched by these remarks, and par- ticularly by the last appeal, and placing his hand upon her head, he said, " Dear child, act as you think best. I will no longer oppose you, and may that unseen pow- er that regulates the fate of the children of men, guide and protect you through life." And wiping the tears from his eyes, he descended to the bar-room. " Dear Kate," said William, as he entered and en- circled her waist with his arm, " does your father still persist in withholding his consent ?" A pleasant smile played around her pretty mouth, and casting upon him a glance of love, pride, and hap- piness, she answered modestly, "' He does not." "Then am I satisfied," he cried, " for now we shall be happy," and he pressed her still closer to his heart. " Dear William," said she, " I should have been high- ly gratified, and very much pleased with you, and should have freely given you my hand, had you been only my equal in society, but to think that you have selected me    234      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, in preference to either of the many proud ladies of rank you might have taken, that you have braved the oppo- sition of your parents, relatives, and friends, -and even forsaken your rich and titled inheritance, all for a poor girl like me, enhances all the love I bear you tenfold! Still I can not but censure myself for causing you, al. though unintentionally, to make that-sacrifice." "Best and noblest of your sex,) cried William, " you are worthy of all I have sacrificed, and more, too, for I can assure you with truth, that I love you far better than all their wealth, title, station, or rank. Now I am truly happy, and care not for the opinions of others." Mr. Pederson's consent having been obtained, prepa- rations for the marriage were at once commenced, and the inn became a scene of lively bustle consequent thereon.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     235 CHAPTER XXVIo THE ABDUCTION. '6 What means all this excitement, Rose?" asked Fel- lows, as he hastily entered the kitchen. "Is it possible that [Mr. Carey does'nt know?" said the girl, artfully. ", I do not, for I have not been told of any transaction that should cause so much bustle." And he cast upon her an angry look, as though he thought she ought to have informed him previously. ' Then I would'nt like to tell you." "Why not?" "Because 'twould make you angry." ' At you?" "Yes! at every one!" "It can not make me angry at you," he cried, "so speak quickly, for you have aroused my curiosity." a Ask Mr. Pederson!9 said Rose, wishing to evade, if possible, an answer that she knew would irritate him. "Why will you aggravate me, Rose? Speak!" is There is to be a wedding here!" "What! her wedding!" cried Fellows, " iss Pe- derson's wedding!" "Yes!" He looked at her, and essayed to speak, but his tongue refused to obey. He fixed his eyes upon her with such a ghastly look that Rose became frightened and re- treated aside.   236      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, /, His senses suddenly seemed to abandon him, and with features pale he sat motionless as a statue. He remain- ed in this state a few minutes, when (as she was about to go for assistance) he began to recover. His eyes assumed a more life-like look, his head moved, and the blood began to return to his face. His nerves and sys- tem had received a fearful shock, but he soon came en- tirely to, and rising from the chair, said angrily, "Why did you not inform me that this was about to take place?" "I did'nt know it until this morning," answered Rose, "and if I had, am I obliged to tell you all I know? ' "Just as I thought! You are in league with your mistress; you have been deceiving me all this time." The blood mounted to Bose's face with passion, as she exclaimed, "It is false! It is'nt my fault that you have " not succeeded in winning Miss Pederson; on the con- trary, it would have pleased me. And because she has accepted Mr. Colborn, you are angry, and throw your spite on me." And as the tears gushed to her eyes, partly from anger and partly from wounded feelings, she started to go towards the door, saying, "I'll go to Mr. Pederson, Miss Pederson, for they will not allow you, sir, or any other lodger, to talk to me in such a manner." "Oh! do not go to them," said Fellows, " it would make a deal of trouble. Besides, if you go, I'll inform them of all you have told me. about the family." This brought Rose to her senses, and becoming more composed, she returned to her former place in the kitchen. "You will not mention it, will you, Rose?" he in- quired, in a kind manner, following her. She did not answer. -   OR THE LDISINHEMRITED.   O I Re leose! ose!" Still she did not answer, and as he left the kitchen he said, "If you do, I'll fill their ears with enough to ruin you."  lie ascended to his room, and throwing himself care- lessly into a chair, abstractedly said, ' I can not, Will not, see her possessed by another." Subsequently he became more calm. However, he frequently paced the floor of his room, as if something weighed heavily on his mind; but in the presence of the family, appearedquite cheerful and loquacious. Mr. Colborn had, about this time, suddenly received a summons from,the admiralty to go to London, upon important business, relative to his station in the navy, Hoping he would be detained but a few days, he took an affectionate leave of his betrothed, and started on his journey. Mr. Pederson and his daughter had frequently dined with Fellows on board of the Nancy, and upon these occasions had enjoyed themselves very much. It was B  a treat to sail in a boat off to the brigantine and back, to promenade the white decks, eat delicious food, and drink sparkling champagne, and they were always hap- py to hear Mr. Carey say that he should be pleased to have them go on board. '"Another lunch comes off on board to-morrow," -said Fellows, to Mr. Pederson, " and I think the weather will be fine to favor us. Should be happy to have the presence of you and your lovely daughter." "Oh! thank you; you are very kind, and I shall avail myself of the opportunity; but Kate is so busy just now, that we cannot depend on her society." Next dlay the old gentleman was in excellent spirits,   238      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, and the weather was so fine, the water so smooth, the breeze so moderate, that the female members of the family were tempted to take a sail also. At one o'clock P. M., the little party, including Fellows, walked down Pell street until reaching the landing, where a boat lay in waiting. He waited on them into the boat, and taking a seat beside them, ordered the officer in charge to pro- ceed on board. The blades of the oars fell simultaneously into the water, and the boat moved forward. "!Unship the oars and set the sails," said Fellows, to the delight of his guests; and soon her white wings were spread over them, and the boat moved gracefully over the harbor's smooth surface, and conveyed her precious cargo safely alongside the clipper-brigantine. They ascended the ladder to the deck, and, after formal salutations with the captain and officers, descended to the cabin. This was arranged upon the old-fashioned plan. A pair of semi-winding stairs, balustered with rich ma- hogany, and covered with costly Brussels carpeting, led from deck to floor. At the top of this stairway there was a doubled-door companion-way, covered with a nice fitting slide, having on each side a polished telescope, resting on little cleats, and at the bottom lay a large colored foot-mat. On either side below were four berths, containing neat and tastily made-up beds, in front of which hung long damask curtains, suspended by large wires of polished brass above, and swept a floor that was covered like the stairs with costly carpeting. Around the transom ran a counter of semi-circular form, covered with fine red velvet, which served as seats or lounges.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     239 Abaft of this were two windows, or ports, that opened out upon the sea, between which was the rudder- casing, covered with highly polished veneering on the sides, and a mirror on the front. On either side of the stairway was a door, the long panel of which being covered with a gilt-edged mirror, reflected every object in the little cabin. i These doors opened into two state- rooms, handsomely fitted-up and furnished, one of which was occupied by Fellows, when on board, and the other by Captain Harvey. Beyond the berths, in either room, was a closet con- taining a chest of arms. Muskets, pistols, swords, cut- lasses, and other instruments were placed in racks, and shone as bright as silver, and ammunition in abundance was carefully stowed beneath. In the center of the cabin stood a table, over which hung a small swinging lamp, which, with a supply of candles, lighted the apartment. The party, consisting of Kate, Mr. Pederson, Fel- lows, and Harvey, seated themselves to partake of the abundance that loaded the table. A servant stood at the back of each gentleman, and Rose waited upon her mistress. Time passed pleasantly; it could hardly be otherwise where all things were so nicely arranged to make them happy. They continued at the table eating heartily and drinking the best of Wines, now a glass of port, now one of champagne, and the time passed very rap- idly away. It was winter, and by four o'clock P. M., at that sea- son of the year, the light of day is about extinct in England; but the lamp being lighted, the approach of night was not realized by either party. At length Kate spoke to her father, and asked the time of day. r    240      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Four o'clock," said he, glancing at his watch, which he replaced in his pocket, and drank another glass of wine. "Indeed!" cried Kate, in astonishment, "I did not wish to remain so long. Come, father, let us go." "I had no idea that it was more than three," said Mr. Pederson. "My dear Carey's company has been so agreeable, and his entertainment so bountiful, that I was unaware of the rapidity with which the time was passing." And taking a glass of sparkling champagne, they were waited upon to the deck, in a polite manner, by the very agreeable and obsequious Fellows and Har- vey. "Where are we?" exclaimed Kate, as she loolked around. "Sure enough!" joined her father, as he could see nothing but water in any direction, and as, looking aloft, he noticed all sails were set. "We appear to be sailing," said Rose. "Why! where is the town, Mr. Carey?" asked Mr. Pederson, becoming uneasy about being obliged to re- turn in a boat after dark. "We cannot see it now," answered Fellows, artfully, "because the atmosphere is hazy." And what are you doing?" asked the old gentle- man, emphatically; " why is your vessel under way?" "Sailing about the harbor." "I wish to return immediately," said Kate, " and it has been against my desire to remain oni board until dark."? "We'll reach town presently," said. Fellows, "so please walk below, for the atmosphere is getting damp." "' We prefer to remain on deck," said Kate.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      241 TThe vessel moved on more speedily as the breeze in- creased, and her sails became moistened by the evening de3w. Fellows' guests, or rather victims, looked eagerly for the town, but in vain;. and as the vessel began suddenly to rise and scud, Mr. Pederson gave a deep-drawn sigh/ for his experience told him that the brigantine was at sea. And Kate and  Rose simultaneously shrieked in anguish, for they then knew that they had been treach- erously abductedo '   242      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER      XXVII. THE CHASE. "Please walk below!" said the villian, in a tone of authority, " for I cannot allow such screaming on deck." "From this," said Mr. Pederson, "I suppose we are prisoners!  ' "You are i" said Fellows, in a firm voice. "YWill none of you," said Mr. Pederson, addressing Harvey and his officers, " take pity on us, and cause the immediate return of this- vessel to Plymouth?" "We cannot!" replied the ungrateful Harvey, who had been treated with all manner of kindness at the inn. "Please go below," said Fellows to his wretched prisoners, " or I shall be obliged to use force." Mr. Pederson did not like the idea, but as the decks were lined, on either side with armed men, ready to carry out the orders of their wicked commander, he saw it would be useless for them to resist; and, obeying the cruel command, he descended to the cabin, followed by his weeping daughter and servant. , Fellows soon descended, and having ordered his steward and attendants to withdraw, and close the door, himself and victims were left in private. He requested them to be seated, and they obeyed. "I have been forced to commit this act," said Fel. lows, " to prevent her I love from being the wife of Lieu- tenant Colborn. My intention is to persuade her to love and marry me. I have tried to forget her, tried to ef-   or0 THE DISINHERITED.    243 face her image from my mind, but in vain. To think she was about to be possessed by another,' made me wretched by day and niglit, and nearly drove me mad. I could not exist without her, and, under those feelings, I was obliged to save myself by resorting to this act of abduction. I regret it, deplore it; I would have given my fortune tohave won her in an honorable manner, but having been unable to accomplish that, I have adopted the only plan which I thought would succeed. - Now, since my love for her has driven me to such extremities, I think it better to submit at once, by com- plying with my request. We are here alone, and in private; Air. Pederson has already given his approval to our marriage, and if his daughter will be a dutiful child, obey her worthy father, and consent to have me, we can be at once united, and this imprisonment ended ere it scarcely has begun." "Never! nevert!" cried Kate, in an emphatic man- ner; "' for even if my heart and hand were free, they could not be won by such base means as you are using. To tell a girl you love her so dearly that you are forced to decoy her on board of your vessel, and there cruelly imprison her! Do you think any sensible person will believe such stupid logic?' Does love beget cruelty?" "You forget," answered Fellows, " that if you were to have remained single this would not have happened. It was the idea of your becoming the wife of another, that drove me to this step. I am young, rich, and as to personal appearance, I leave that to yourself; whom I allow to be the best judge. I will be to you a kind and indulgent husband; you shall not want for any- thing wealth can obtain, and as you have your father's advice and wishes to accept of me, I am sure it is your duty to do so. Come, dear Kate, obey your fa- ther's wishes, -and consent to wed me."   244      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Such have been my wishes,"7 earnestly said Mr. Pe- derson, " but not now ; not after this villainous conduct! No, sir! I retract all I have said in encouragement of your union with my daughter. I took you to be an honorable man. I tool to you more than to any man I ever knew and for this cause and for the difference between the standing of my family and that of Sir Wil- liam Colborn's, I inclined to favor you rather than Lieut. Colborn. But now, since the outrage to myself and family, since I have found to my sorrow that you are nothing less than a villainous wretch, I would by far rather see Kate laid in the cold grave than led by you to the hymeneal altar." "And,'L cried Kate, " if my father had still seen fit to advise, and even commanded me, to give my hand to such a fiend as yourself, do you think that I would have done so? Do you think I am a child, and have no right to a choice myself? You speak of fine looks and wealth! :Fiend! had you the fine person of a King Xerxes, or the attractions of Leicester; or did you pos- sess the wealth of the Indies, I would refuse you with the greatest scorn!"  Come, sir," said Mr. Pederson, "you see you can- not intimidate us; and I expect, yes, command you, to return immediately to Plymouth, and land myself and family from whence you abducted us." "You can be conveyed there at ohcee' said Fellows, addressing Mr. Pederson, " for I have hired a faithful lugger skipper, who follows us, for that very purpose; but your daughter will remain with me. I'll also detain Rose, to assist me in changing the mind of the obsti- nate lady." ("What! you would not be so cruel as to separate me from my daughter!"

" Do take us back to Pljmouth," implored Rose, " or anywhere else - only set us. free 1 Do not forget the many acts of kindness we have shown you at the inn." Fellows was somewhat affected by this language, and having remained silent for some time, as if contending with his thoughts, he took a glass, and half-filling it with brandy, drank it, as if to drown them. "It is hard to separate you," said he, "but it must be done; so prepare for the event." And treading from side to side, as if to hurry over the disagreeable act, he impatiently bade Mr. Pederson depurt. The old man did not move to go. "Mr. Pederson," cried Fellows, in a determined man- ner, " you must leave the brigantine, and go on board of the lugger." "I cannot go," sobbed the old man, now entirely dis- heartened, as he saw by the villain's determined manner that such would inevitably be his fate. "I cannot leave her! Oh! I was sure I was to be allowed to remain with her!" "You cannot," harshy answered Fellows, " so pre- pare to go!" "I had thought you bad," said Mr. Pederson, in a firmer voice; " but not so vile, not so great a demon as you are." Fellows pulled a bell-rope, and almost instantly his steward opened the door above, and answered to the summons. "Call Captain Harvey!" "Ay! ay! sir!" "Harvey! call the watch!" said Fellows, as the skip- per made his appearance.   246      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Th'e next minute six armed sailors descended the stairway, while others were filed around the companion- way above. "Mr. Pederson," said Fellows, authoritatively, "you must go." "Villain! fiend!" shrieked Kate, raising herself to her-utmost height, and advancing towards him, appar- ently with the intention of seizing him by the throat; but Rose caught hold of her mistress's robe and held her back. "Your daughter shall never be injured by me," said Fellows, " nor by any one; I have too much love for her to wish to injure 'her; and if I had none I would not allow her to be wronged, owing to the great respect I still have for yourself, and the gratitude I have for the unbounded kindness you have shown me at your home. But you must go, and instantly, too!"And as he spoke, he motioned the sailors to advance. Mr. Pederson started from his seat to obey the cruel mandate, as he now saw there was no way to avoid it; and as he cast a look of pityv on his daughter, she grasped him by the arm, and shrieked, "Father! do not go! Never leave me here with such a wretch! Oh! I shall be ruined forever! lHe can not tear you from me, for these sailors would refuse to enact such cruelty; they are not so inhuman! Stay! for he has no power to separate us." Fellows looked at his men confidently, and turning to the unhappy party, said, "I do not censure you for be- ing angry with me, and do not take to heart what at other times, and under different circumstances, I would have taken as insults." "We care not whether you take such as insults or not!" cried Kate. "Villain what can you do? Do   OR THE DISINHERITED, -247 you think you can injure us, because these men are armed, and paid to obey your orders? If you do think so, you are very much mistaken; it is impossible for those sailors to be so hardened in iniquity as to obey such wicked orders. Do not think that because you are a vagabond, a demon in human form yourself, that those men are of the same nature-their looks disclose that they cannot enact such cruelty." ' Men! step forward!" commanded Fellows. "You would not tear my father from me, sailors! would you?" appealed Katee  "No! you would not, could not do it." The men, thus appealed to, hesitated to obey. "Mr. Pederson!" cried the villainous Fellows, "if ybu do not leave your daughter and go on board the lugger immediately, the sailors must compel you to." Kate clasped her arms, around her father's neck, and said, imploringly, "Oh! stay with me; do not leave me, father, in this villain's power." "Seize him, and conduct him to the lugger!" said Fellows. "Stay or go," cried Kate, "I'll do the same; my fa- ther shall'not leave me." "' Seize him, I say!" cried the inhuman commander, "and do not listen to her cries." ax The sailors, in obedience to the order, stepped for- ward, but the heart-rending shrieks of the unhappy Kate so completely won their compassion that they re- fused to obey. "Why do you not seize him?" cried Fellows, in a rage. "I can not," said one. ' I will not," said another. "I was sure of it," cried Kate; " accept my deepest gratitude, kind men!"   248       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "What!" exclaimed Fellows, "refuse to obey orders! Mutiny on the high seas! Harvey! here's mutiny! Go on deck, you mutinous scoundrels! and you shall rue this disobedience.' "Come, father, let us go. The lugger awaits us, and his men will not obey him." "-Come!" cried Rose, " he 'has no power to keep us here." And they moved to go. "You can not go," said Fellows, and he seized Kate by the arm. "Unhand me, fiend-!" cried Kate, as she extricated herself from his grasp; " your touch is contaminating." "Harvey! more sailors!" and the next instant that wretch and half a dozen other men descended the stair- way to the cabin, and seized hold of Mr. Pederson, while Fellows renewed his hold on Kate. "Captain Harvey!" exclaimed the old man, ,' I did not expect such treatment at your hands, no matter what I might have expected from these unfeeling sail- ors. You have sat at my board in friendship; you have ever been treated kindly by me, and yet you are assist- ing to do me the greatest of injuries." Harvey instantly stood aloof from the affair, and con- cluded he would assist-no more. The sailors, however, who had never before seen Kate, and were the most hardened pirates amongst the crew, , continued to drag Mr. Pederson from his daughter. "Oh! that I were a man, to hurl these villains from my father," said Kate. "Have you not fathers? sis- ters? wives? Would you see them stolen from their homes, imprisoned, torn asunder, and treated worse than slaves? Rose, help me! I, that am but a weak girl, a defenseless female, will defend my father and my honor to the last." And exerting herself with - mighty   OR THE DISINHERITED.     249 efforts to oppose the superior strength of powerful men, her strength gave out, and she fell fainting to the floor. Mr. Pederson was now dragged upon deck and to the gangrway, while Rose, frightened and screaming piteous- ly, leaned over the motionless person of her mistress, fearing her life had become extinct. As the inhuman wretches forced the heart-broken father over the side of the vessel into the lugger, he implored, as the only boon within the reach of hope, that his daughter might in no way be injured. "She shall not," said the demon Fellows; and as the lugger moved away, he cried to her skipper to convey that gentleman in safety to Plymouth. "I'll do so," was the reply, and soon the lugger dis- appeared in the dark. Fellows returned to the cabin, andTopening his room door, said, "There is your room, ladies," and, laying the key on the table, he ascended to the deck, leaving Kate -who had just recovered from her fainting fit-- seated on the transom, shrieking as if her heart would break, and Rose standing by her side, as if in readiness to defend her mistress, and also weeping bitterly. When the unfortunate girls had mourned until ex- hausted nature gave way, they entered the state-room, locked the door, and laid down in the berths. But no sleep came to relieve them of their misery. Not even discouraging sea-siclkness could alleviate the pain of their lacerated hearts. As time progressed, that surest balm to the troubled mind, they become more calm, and accepted of some nutritious food and coffee. "Think the villain will venture to enter this room, by bursting open the door?" asked Kate. 12   250      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "He will do anything his wicked heart suggests," answered Rose. "What stupidity, to think he can force me to become his wife! The wicked wretch!" "What have you heard him say," asked Kate, " from first to last, concerning me?"  "Nothing against you; but on the contrary he al-  i ways spoke in your favor. And that, loving you, he could not bear to think that he could not win you."' "You do not think he means to harm me, then?" "He could do anything, no matter how wicked," an- swered Rose, " after stealing us from our home---and think it trifling." "I should like," said Kate, " to be able to defend my- self against any intrusion. Here are arms in this closet, let us examine them. Ho-o fortunate'! here is a splen- did pair of pistols, and they are loaded. You take one, i Rose, and I will the other, and with them we will de- fend ourselves to the last." "Sail, ho!" cried the look-out aloft; and in a short time the stranger became visible from the deck. "What is she?" asked Fellows, anxiously. The captain laid down his telescope, and with a look of regret, said, "I think she is a French man-of-war." "A French man-of-war!" exclaimed Fellows, " this is unfortunate, in war time. What shall we do?" "Run for escape," answered Harvey. "I hope she will not prove so fast a sailer as did the English frigate!" "(I hope not," said the captain. All sail was made upon the brigantine, and she bore away toward England in an opposite direction from the stranger.   OR THE DISINHERITED,     251 "Never more boast of the sailing qualities of this accursed slow coach,"' said Fellows, as it became evi- dent that the stranger was gaining on them. "I think the Nancy is the fastest craft in the chant nel," said the captain. "So fast," said Fellows, with a sneer, ' that she near- ly 'lost my life in the last chase, and now puts it in jeopardy." The booming of a chase-gun filled the breast of Fel- lows with still greater anxiety; but with the prisoners it was the occasion of curiosity and hope. ; Oh! the misfortune of being on board such a creep- ing snail," said Fellows. "It is a pity she would not sink at once." "There is no doubt, in my mind, but that such will be the case, sir," said the mate, as a shot passed over the quarter. Harvey watched the little craft's every motion, and ;   taking the helm himself, steered her with his usual calm- ness in times of danger; but remarked to Fellows that he had not wished to approach the coast of France so near in time of war. "I considered it safer to be here than near to Eng- land," said Fellows, " as I feared that armed vessels would be sent after us by the admiralty." "Well," observed Harvey, " you see how safe it is on this coast," as a cannon ball skipped over the water past the brigantine. All was now confusion on board the little vessel, and the officers and crew seemed to be of opinion that a surrender would be better than'to be blown in pieces by the batteries of the ship-of-war. Kate and Rose had been informed of the condition of things by the steward, and prayed sincerely to their   252      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Maker that the Nancy might be taken, not doubting that the Frenchmen, although England's foes, would treat them far better than would pirates. The next shot cut away the main shrouds, but still the little craft sailed on, although her pursuer was fast gaining, and would no doubt shortly fire a broadside upon her decks and sink her. At this critical moment, the horizon become obscured by a thick mist, and soon a fog enshrouded the two ves- sels, so that neither could be seen by the other. "Now we'll haul her up," said Harvey; and bracing up the yards, hauling aft her fore and aft sheets, the brigantine listed by the force of the wind upon her beam, and leaped ahead-on a course at right angles with that lately followed. Soon the ship passed by, still firing chase-guns as be- fore, but without effect, for the Nancy had gone aside. Fellows and Harvey looked anxiously in the direction from whence came the sound of cannon, fearing they might yet be discovered; but no, the fog was too dense, and it had set in for the remainder of the day. The Nancy was safe; all on board, excepting two, were made happy-and she sailed away for the English coast.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     253 CHAPTER      XXVIII. THE REMOVAL. Mr. Pederson was conveyed'safely back to Plymouth in the lugger. On arriving he immediately made known to the authorities and his friends the treacherous con- duct of Carey, and soon the town was aroused to a tre- mendous pitch of excitement. An armed vessel was sent in pursuit- of the brigantine. His. house appeared to him as a deserted dwelling, for his idol daughter was gone. Even the presence of Rose, who had been in the family so long, would have been a great consolation to him; but she, alas! had been also stolen. He ascended to the parlor, then en- tered the sitting-room, the dining-room, and then the kitchen; but their former occupants had all gone. On being asked by a friend concerning the affair, he f could not find words to reply- and sank into a chair and wept. Neighbors called, customers made inquiries, and it was soon known-far and near that the pretty Kate and her maid Rose had been abducted. The neighbors sympathized with Mr. Pederson, and took a lively in- terest in his efforts to reclaim the lost ones. Yet he would not be comforted, and as his friends were of opinion that the sight of the inn, its rooms, furniture, and familiar objects aggravated his anguish, they advised him, for the present, to abandon his business, well knowing that he had accumulated a   25-4 0LIEUTENANT COLBORN, considerable amount, and therefore could afford to. They at length prevailed on him to be more composed, and also to reside with a friend in the outskirts of the town. Colborn read the sad letter that informed him of the abduction, bult, with the exception of his pale features, no outward show of anguish was displayed. His was a temperament that was not easily excited to passionate emotions, either of joy or sadness; yet when aroused, he felt all the more deeply. He reported the abduction of Mr. Pederson's family to the admiralty, and made it his business to make every effort to find her whom the villain had snatched from him when she was about to make him happy. As Mr. Pederson continued still to brood over the absence of his daughter, his friends feared his health would suffer, and advised him to go from Plymouth on a tour through the country for a change. There were no longer any attractions left, either at the inn or in the town, for him, and he resolved to go to London. He started on a cloudy, dismal day, which well compared with his thoughts. He traveled on the old interior stage route, but notwithstanding the change of scenery, his daughter was constantly uppermost in his thoughts. He knew she must be perfectly miserable; he lost all hope of ever seeing her again; and above all, he grieved to think she must be the prey to that wicked man, that she was at the mercy of such a consummate villain. After three days' traveling over bad roads and in crowed stages, he, being in need of a  day's rest, stopped 4t' the village of Esk,. in the vicinity of his birthplace. After entering an inn he was conducted to a room, where he partook of a good repast, and being much fatigued, retired, and soon fell into a sound sleep, it be- ing the first since the abduction of his child. c   OR THE DISINHERITED.     255 In the morning, while conversing with the landlord, he found him to be an old school-mate of his; and by further conversation, he learned to his delight that others he had been familiar with in youth, still lived at the village. The report having spread that Mr. George Pederson, after an absence of many years, had returned on a visit to his native village, several old acquaintances called to see him, and invited him to their houses. It must have seemed, very strange to him, after hav- ing been away for so long a time, to return and witness the many changes that had taken place in the thriving village. He, having accepted invitations from his early com- panions, visited their houses, conversed with them upon occurrences that had taken place far back, and which seemed to him like dreams. His mind became inter- ested, and he regained in a measure his accustomed cheerfulness. He remained a week with them, during which time they did all in their power to make him happy; sympa- thized with him in his troubles, and urged him to remain longer with them. He bade them adieu, and entering the stage, left the village, casting a look of regret behind as it disappeared from view. As the vehicle moved on, his former gloomy feelings returned, and the image of his child often appeared to his mind, making him again unhappy. At Epsom he again stopped, but the same gloomy feelings remained with him. One day was sufficient to prove that he should receive no benefit there ; so he proceeded on his journey until Greenwich was reached, when, crossing the river, he entered the great city for the first time for many years,   256       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Now," he soliloquized, "I'll become my former self, for in London there are so many things to interest one that he must naturally forget, at least partially, other matters which would be unpleasant in his mind." Here is a numerous population, with hundreds of carriages moving through the streets, and the noise is almost deafening. The great blocks of buildings on either side of the crowded streets; the steeples, monu- ments, bridges, and parks are constantly presenting some new aspect, and with hundreds of attractions of more or less importance, to allure the stranger on. He penetrated as soon as possible to the center of the metropolis, and to the street where he had formerly resided. He stopped at the door of the house he had once occupied, and rang the bell; but a stranger looked at him in vain for recognition. He called at another, and yet another house, where he had formerly known friends, or at least acquaintances, but none could be found. He sought yet another street, and wandered along until he reached the residence of another old acquaintance, but all in vain, for none but strangers were there. All had changed residences in this world, or gone to the next. The old man sought for informa- tion of his daughter, but finding lone, he sank into his former state of unhappiness. London, with all its ten thousand changing scenes, could not give him that con- tentment of mind that the village of Esk had afforded him, and he resolved to return to the latter place at once. He hurried from London, and in due time arrived in sight of his pleasant birth-place; and as its hills became distinctly visible, a cheerful expression came over his features, unknown to them since his departure from the village.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     257 The stage halted at the inn, and, as the landlord shook him heartily by the hand, he observed, pleasantly, that that was the first friendly shake of the hand he had had since leaving. He soon again became as cheerful as when he tarried at the place before; and experiencing many acts of kindness from his old friends, he resolved to remain there instead of returning to Plymouth. r$Q   /   258       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER    XXIX. THE UNINTENTIONAL CONQUESTS. As the Earl of Surrey's carriage drove over the frozen ground, conveying his family home after the party at Mount Prospect, the thoughts of his daughter Arabella were upon the fine-looking, intellectual, and noble Wil- liam Colborn. And when she awoke from her peaceful slumbers late on the following morning, her mind again reverted to him, and to the pleasant dreams that had attended her sleep, and even made her the wife of him who had unconsciously won her young heart's dearest affections. But days and weeks passed, and no circumstance transpired to bring about a meeting with the object of her love. Her thoughts were constantly upon him, and often would her heart leap for joy at the announcement of some gentleman caller whose step or voice she fan- cied resembled his. When, at length, invitation cards to attend a party at the residence of Admiral Holbroke reached the Surrey mansion, Arabella was delighted; not, 'however, so much with anticipations of the gay scenes of a ball- room, for those were common to her, but she strongly surmised that as Mr. Colborn was an officer in the navy, and as Admiral Holbroke was an intimate friend of Sir William's, that the Colborns would be there, and she would therefore be most likely to meet her heart's idol. Her fond hope proved correct. i  /  -   OR THE DISINHERITED.     Mi; The palace-like drawing-room of the mansion of Ad- miral Holbroke, at the "' West End," began to fill with gay guests, and presently among them appeared Wil- liam, attired in the full-dress uniform of the navy. Arabella cast a furtive look of innocent affection upon his handsome features and noble figure, and as she marked his grace of deportment, and listened to his musical voice, the impression he had made upon her heart was, if possible, deepened. Lieutenant Colborn had not made his appearance in that gay circle for enjoyment; no, his mind was too much engrossed in the loss of his betrothed wife, but the admiral had specially requested his presence, and as that personage had exerted himself in sending out cruis- ers to search for the pirate brigantine, and had always been his friend, William felt it his duty to be at the party. Arabella was not the only lady present, whose heart William had unwittingly made conquest of. Ellen Lester was present. She sat in the center of a gay circle, and as he advanced, mentally said, "There is that fine Colborn, who has created an interest in my heart, when a dozen others have tried and failed. What a step he has! What an air! I declare I will tax my pow- ers of fascination to their utmost this night to interest him. My lady, Arabella Surrey, appears to have at- tracted his attention, and I see she fancies him, and there are others here who would be dangerous rivals; but mine he must be. It is astonishing that he has not ac- knowledged my supremacy; never before did any man prove so obdurate! I must win him to-night, or some other fair one will!" Presently the eye of the lieutenant caught a sight of her commanding figure, and approaching, he extended his hand, and smilingly alluded to their last meeting.   260       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, She cast upon him a penetrating glance- a glance expressive of commingled pleasure and anxiety to please, that would have penetrated the heart of almost any other man, but it feel upon his calm features like rain upon the surface of a marble statue! In vain did she bring all her brilliant talent of wit and repartee to bear upon him - in vain did she contrive to have her furtive glances of admiration at his classic features perceived by him - in vain did she train out all the arts so well known to a coquette --though outwardly he acknowl- edged her attractive person--his heart remained un- touched! Colborn, having conversed sufficiently with her for the demands of politeness, left her, after having prom- ised to return, as she had artfully told him that she had an important secret to disclose to him, just as he had: arisen from his seat to go. He walked up the room, and his eyes met the modest glance of the faultless Arabella. She had been far from happy while nWilliam sat by the side of Ellen; for jealousy will sometimes take possession of the noblest natures, in spite of the most resolute exertions t repel it. He gracefully accosted her, and as a slight crimson suffused her pretty face, reminding him of his absent Kate, a shadow passed over his countenance. She no- ticed this, and that he was not cheerful, and a corres- ponding expression spread over her features. She feared that another would obtain him, but could not, like Ellen, tell him so by bold manners - yet her mod- est eyes inadvertently expressed what she was otherwise careful to conceal. But William's mild and reserved manner told her plainly that she had not excited love in his heart. But if he did not love, he could not but admire the excellent i girl before him; and, as she read his mind, a tear glis- I   OR THE DISINHERITED.     261 tened on her cheek, and fearing it might be noticed if she rermoved it with her kerchief, she dared not raise the embroidered cambric to her face. William pressed her hand, and as he walked away she felt her heart sinking, and another tear followed the one already on her cheek - and yet another as his form receded, for she well knew that some other would possess him, and that she could never be his wife. For the remainder of the evening she continued to be unhappy, although gay scenes surrounded her, and when she reached her home, and for years afterwards, she regretted that cruel fate had not sanctioned her heart's choice, and made her the bride of William Colborn. He was about to leave the ball, although he had not participated in any dance, when, to his surprise, his eyes fell full upon his father, mother, and sister. Melissa hurried to her brother, and grasped his hand; Mrs. Colborn remained at a distance, and the general walked away, and disappeared among the mass of gay pleasure-seekers. William wished to advance and speak to his mother, but, as he met her cold and haughty look, he hesitated to do so. "William, have you seen Arabella this evening?" asked Melissa. "I have," he replied, " have just left her." Mrs. Colborn advanced a step towards him as she heard his answer. "She is lovely, is she not?" asked Melissa, looking into his eyes, as if to catch an answer from them ere he spoke, and hoping Arabella might yet have a claim on his thoughts - knowing she loved him. "She is," calmly answered William; and, as he no- ticed the eyes of his mother become more pleasant, he   62      MLIEUTENANT COLBORN, advanced towards her another step, saying, '"and I really like her." Mrs. Colborn, on hearing this, immediately grasped him by the hand. ' "I am happy to meet you, my son, as I notice that you have repented of your errors, and will now proba- bly return to your home a reformed young man." William shook his mother's hand affectionately, and a tear stole down his cheek, in spite of his manly efforts to prevent it. "Of course, Willie is going home with us," said Me- lissa, clasping her brother's arm more closely. "Yes," said Mrs. Colborn, pleasantly, " and I am ex. tremely happy that he has given up his low-born asso- ciates." William sighed, for his mother's speech reminded him that he had indeed been separated from the only one who could make him happy; still, he had not relin- quished all hope of her being restored to him. "And if I have not done so?" asked William. Mrs. Colborn let go his hand, and gravely asked, "Have you not?"  "I have not," independently answered William, ( but still maintain the same principles upon this subject as when we parted. I  have the same devotion for my be. trothed wife as ever." As   he finished speaking, the eyes of Mrs. Colborn resumed their stern, cold expression, and lifting her -hand she waved him from her, saying, "Then you can never enter our house;," and she turned apparently un- feelingly from him. William pressed his sister's hand, and walked away dejectedly. He determined to leave the ball at once, ,and .see in .litude that alleviation to his troubles that ,seqk j4 ,pqitu. e . ht  .llevitio;.i t   OR THE DISINHERITED.     263  public gaiety would not give. He was about to bid adieu to the admiral's family, when his promise to Ellenl flashed across his mind, and he hastened towards her. With smiles and charms she received him, glad of the opportunity of conversing again with him she loved. "6 I have come," said he, " according to promise, to receive from your lips that important secret." '"Then I am indebted to the secret for your company," said Ellen, "rather than to the pleasure of my society." u I frankly acknowledge that I have come to obtain the secret, and also to bid you good evening, as I am about to go." "I regret," said Ellen, " that you are to leave so early. Can you not remain longer?"5 "I do not feel well enough to remain here,) he an- swered, but did not enlighten her as to what was the cause of his illness. ' I regret that," she said, in a feeling manner, " and must reserve the secret until we meet again." "Indeed!" said William, "I had hoped I was to hear it now; you have excited my curiosity." "Well, then," said the artful girl, " call upon me to- morrow, and I will disclose it to you.9 "I really hardly think I can," answered William, not wishing to flatly decline an invitation he by no means wished to accept. "Then I cannot disclose to you the secret,' said she, with a smile. William's curiosity being aroused, and thinking as their two families were intimate, that the secret might relate to circumstances connected with himself, he was strongly tempted to accept of her invitation, in order to hear the secret. "C Surely, you cannot refuse to call, and learn what   264.      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, may interest yourself " said Ellen, as she cast upon him a wishful look. "'I promise to do so," he said, with a respectful bow; and bidding her good evening, he left her and, the ball. On the following day, he drove to the mansion of Sir James Lester. On arriving, he was shown into the drawing-room, and it must be acknowledged that he could not but admire the beauty of Ellen, as she arose to receive him. Her fine figure, her tapering waist, set off to' advantage by her broad shoulders, full bust, and the expansive folds of her cloud-like robe; her symmetrical features, dark, penetrating eyes, coal-black hair, and queen-like gait fully entitled her to be termed a belle. She was never more agreeable than upon this occasion, never so much pleased in any man's society as in his. Indeed, he must have been dull of comprehension, not to have seen that she was very much enamored of him. "You have been faithful to your promise," said Ellen. "Did you doubt my word?"' "I did not, but feared as your ill-health 'forced you from me last night, that it might keep you from me to- day; and particularly as you are not so anxious to be in my society, as another is to be in yours." William sighed as he thought there was indeed an- other who doubtless was anxious to be with him. But would that other have been pleased to see him where he was? At first sight, Kate would no doubt have trembled violently with jealousy, to witness him seated alone with Ellen, and she would very naturally have asked herself, "What does he -here? How came he here? Why should he call on her? -Why is he alone with her?" But could she at the same time have seen his pure and   OR THE DISINHERITED.      265 faithful heart, that throbbed only for love of herself, she would have been pleased. "And whom, may I ask,5' said William, "1 do you mean by another?" r( Her before you," answered Ellen, without blushing. "You compliment me too highly," said he. "But, the secret! I am now entitled to the promised secret." "The secret," said she, " is of so much consequence to me, that I hardly dare disclose it; after all." u' I had hoped," said William, "' that it contained in- formation relating to something that weighs heavily upon my mind." "Well, so it does," said Ellen, with a smile. "Oh, what is it, then?" She arose from her seat on the sofa, advanced towards him, and throwing her arms about him, said, "This is the secret. I love yozu. William, perfectly'astonished, stood for a minute like a statue, gazing upon her. "I regret," at length he said, " that I should be the cause of disappointment or unhappiness to you; such has not been my intention, I assure you, but I cannot return your love, as another already has my heart." I will not attempt to portray the scene that followed, and will only say that William remained but a short time longer, when he departed, extremely chagrined that he had been the unwitting cause of the contre temps.   266      LIEUTENANT OOLBORN, C HAPTER XXX THE DISCLOSURE. The thread of our tale obliges us again to refer to the brigantine, on board of which Kate was a prisoner. "Harvey," said Fellows, "as we have now so mi- raculously escaped from that French man-of-war, and are again on the English coast, I wish you to change the name, rig, and color of this accursed vessel, as soon as possible." The Nancy, against which her owner was so much prejudiced, in consequence of having been beaten twice by ships of war, was at this time painted black, relieved by a broad white streak around her waist, having squares of black let in at equi-distance to represent ports of a man-of-war, and a narrow bead of white ran around her rail from knight's head to tafferel. Her rig being perfectly square forward, and having yards above a fore and aft lower mast aft, made 'her a brigantine. Men were soon aloft, at work striking her after yards, and others over the sides on stages, busily engaged at painting. On the following morning, the Nancy bore the name of Retreat. She was painted all over a jet black ; and her rig was that of an hermaphrodite brig. "How do you like her now?" asked Harvey, as Fel- lows ascended to the deck, and took a survey of the wonderful change that had been wrought on the exter- nal appearance of the little vessel. a How does she look?"   OR THE DISINHERITED.     267 "Capital! Now let them search for the Nancy, and see if they'll find her." "She is so altered in appearance," said Harvey, " that none could recognize her." "I am getting to be much at variance with these narrow escapes," said Fellows, " and I intend to con- coct some plan to leave the sea. No doubt ere long we will have to try our speed again. Hang it, though! if we had a fast-sailing vessel it wouldn't be so bad; but this slow thing, I fear, will yet be our ruin." "I'll risk my head on her good sailing qualities," said Harvey with a shake of the head, as he cast his eye aloft at her raking masts. "' Our two escapes," said Fellows, "were not accom- plished by the good sailing qualities of the vessel; for the first we may thank the Scilly Isles, and the last, the fog. Do you not sometimes feel alarmed, and wish to change this manner of life on the ocean?" "If I could live as easy, and make as much money on shore," replied Harvey, "I would abandon the sea, but to live on shore in poverty, merely for the sake of always being free from capture, never!" "shall leave' the sea," said Fellows, '"as early as possible." ",But what mill you do with the girls? for if you should take them on shore, they will disclose the affair, and then what would be your fate?" "There is the trouble," replied Fellows. "What do you think? Think she will give in and marry me?" "Oh, perhaps she will! how can she hold out against such treatment?" "I must go down and try her again," and he de- scended to his cabin,-and rapping at the door of the room in which the fair prisoners were confined, demanded ad-   268   .   LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Why do you wish to be admitted?" asked Kate. "Because I have something of importance to say to you." "Say it from where you are then," replied the deter- mined girl, "I will not admit you." '"I declare," said Fellows, "that I do not wish to harm you, so admit me, or come out!" "Never!" "Then I shall have to force you from the room, for you know I can do -it easily.'? "If you make the attempt," cried Kate in a deter- mined manner, "I shall fire on you." "I am also armed, so beware, and do not aggravate m!" "Speak no more to us!" cried Kate, " for we will not answer; but, .worst of fiends, act, we are ready." "Sail, ho!" shouted the look-out. "Where away?" "One point on the lee bow, sir, and close aboard." "Oh! here she is!" cried Harvey, "just looming up out of the fog! she's a schooner on the other tack.'" "Brig, ahoy!" "Halloa!" "What brig is that?" "The Retreat." "By the curse of fate!" exclaimed Fellows, " there is Colborn, and we are lost! for she is a man-of-war!" "Not yet exactly," said Harvey, " but go below, or he'll recognize you." "What does he say?" cried Kate with joy, as she heard mentioned the name of him she loved. "He said," answered Rose, " that he on board the other vessel is Colborn, and the captain told him to go below."   OR THE DISINHERITED .     269 Kate became so perfectly delighted at this intelligence, that she clasped her arms around the neck of her maid, and kissed her. "Where are you from, and where bound?" demanded Colborn. "I know his voice!" cried Kate, " oh, I am so happy! for now we will be taken from this pirate's grasp. He has come no doubt in an armed vessel.9" "From Cork, in ballast, bound to Newcastle," an- swered Harvey. "Oh! the wretch!" exclaimed Rose, " he has told a lie, for he said this vessel- is from Cork." "He wishes to deceive the questioner," said Kate, "but he can not, for our friend can read this vessel's name, and recognize her. Oh, I am made so happy! We will be home to-morrow, Rose! My gratitude to himn is unbounded.", "And is not your love for him also unbounded?" asked Rose. Kate did not answer, but silently placed her arm in Rose's, and again kissed her. "That's rather a fine vessel," said the first officer of the schooner to her commander, " to go to Newcastle for coals!" "Yes), said Colborn lightly, "for paint sometimes makes old vessels new." "a Have you seen any brigantines lately?" a Only one!" answered the wily Harvey. "Where?" "Off the Lizzard!" "' What vessel was she? Do you know?" "Yes.  The Nancy of London." "When did you see her?" cried the now anxious Colborn.   270      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Yesterday." "Where was she bound?" "Into the Bristol Channel." The schooner immediately bore away. She was a fast sailer, and cut the water like a knife, as the fresh- oning breeze propelled her through it. She had been fitted out by orders of the admiralty at the suggestion of Admiral Holbroke, who had been strongly solicited to use his influence with that important body. Colborn's wishes to be placed in command of the little vessel had been complied with. She mounted four guns, and had a crew of thirty-six men. He had full powers to sink, burn, destroy, or capture the Nancy, and with high hope had commenced his important errand. The schooner flew along before the smart breeze, the spray from the sea-caps flying over her, and sprinkling her snow-white canvas fore and aft. But had she been propelled as swift as flies the swallow, she would not have satisfied his impatient spirit. Oh, with what joy would his mind have been filled, if he had known that the brigantine he was searching for was thus within his reach! --that she he mourned for had heard his well-known voice! - that she he loved above all others, was instantly expecting him to rescue her! And with what impetuosity would he have dashed on board the disguised vessel! The schooner bounded away, while the breeze that soon separated the two vessels far asunder drowned the voices of the unfortunate females, and for the time dis- pelled all hopes of release from their doleful imprison- ment. Now was the time for Fellows to renew his suit. "Your friend's 'vessel is far away," said he, " and can no longer be seen, so your escape is impossible. Now, ,       ,   OR THE DISINHERITED.     271 Miss Pederson, your good sense must tell you that it is folly for you to hold out longer, and understand me, I will no longer be denied the privilege of speaking with you face to face. c"If you'ldo not open the door, I shall break it in." "Act as you please," said the brave girl, "we are armed." '"I will not harm youl!" "Do you think I will believe a man who' has so treacherously and basely stolen me from my home? No! you are a fiend." "If I am a fiend," said Fellows, "my love for you has made me such." "A strange kind of love," cried Kate, " thus to cause a man to become so depraved and hardened in vice, that no scene is cruel enough to touch his wicked heart. I will not trust- myself in such a monster's presence." "You are in my power," said he, " and I shall see your face." A noise of some heavy implement, and the cracking and snapping of the wood now informed them that he was making exertions to break the lock of the door. Kate and her servant stood side by side, firmly hold- inOg their pistols in their extended arms ready to fire. Presently with a crash the door gave way, and Fellows stood before them-and at the same moment the pis- tol of Kate was aimed at his face, and fired. The bullet passed through his hair, and as he felt its round, hard surface, just above his brain, a shudder ' came over him, and he retreated, and quick as light- ning closed the door. It was not too soon, for Rose, following the example of her mistress, fired at the same moment, and the ball found a lodgment in the wood in- stead of his, body.   272      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, The girls finding bullets were more serviceable to them in their present position than door-locks, took from the closet two other loaded pistols, and seated them- selves in readiness to defend their lives and honor to the last. "Miss Pederson," said Fellows calmly, "you came within an inch of killing me, for the ball passed just over my head." "Then I wish it had gone just that inch lower," re- plied Kate. "Do you wish to become a murderess?"  "I do not! but the instant you open that door again, I will shoot you. Do you hear?" Fellows did hear, and thought, too, and came to the conclusion from what he had experienced of the deter- mined character of his prisoner, that it would be better to use gentle means, to speak to her in a kind manner, than to make further attempts in the way of compulsion. "If you will agree, Miss Pederson, to accompany me to my mother's in London, and converse with her i upon the subject, I will convey you there." This suggestion brought a feeling of hope to the minds of the prisoners, and they reasoned that, once in London, they 'could, by making their condition known, effect their liberty. They remained silent for some time, and then began a low conversation. "If he has a mother," said Kate, " it would be well for us to be conveyed to her." "Mother!" said Rose with a sneer, "what mother would own such a wretch- for a son? ' "He spoke of his mother, however," said Kate, ' when at our house. I am. of opinion that he has a mother." "If he has or has not," observed Rose, " we would   OR THE DISINHERITED,     273 be much better off anywhere on shore, than on board of this vessel with these pirates." "We certainly would," joined Kate, " so let us agree to his proposal immediately." '"Will you agree to my proposal?" asked Fellows, after waiting some time in silence. "We will," answered Kate, " but conditionally." Fellows stood thinking a moment., He supposed when he first made up his mind to entrap her, that after a few days she would become intimidated, and in order to regain her liberty would agree to have him. He had nbot the slightest idea that she would prove so he- roic; and was perfectly astonished to find that she knew how to use a pistol. The fear also of being taken either by some French vessel of war, or by one of the -cruisers he knew the government had sent in search of him, now had an influence in inducing him to propose milder measures. "What are your conditions?" he asked in a pleasant manner. "That we shall be no more molested," answered Kate, " either on board of your vessel, or on shore; and that after a conversation with your mother, we shall be set at liberty." Fellows, thinking if she did not consent to his wishes after an interview with his mother, that he could kidnap her, and convey her to the care of old Peg, said, "I will agree to your conditions, but mark me! if you seek to evade your part of the contract, I will ruin your character." "How?" demanded Kate. "By slander." Kate well knew that under the circumstances slander could give a death-blow to her reputation, 13   274      LIEUTENANT COLBORE, Would Colborn be willing, to unite himself in mar- riage with a lady whose Aiftue was tainted with bad reports? -was a question that obtruded upon her, and she wept when she perceived the wiles in which the villain had entrapped her. And who can estimate the amount of evil that slan- der has produced in the world! No hero or heroine will seek his or her redress for grievances, real or supposed, by such cowardly means. Yet still it is often resorted to, and in a shameless man- ner, by unprincipled persons, who know of no other way of obtaining revenge. One who perhaps has been of- fended by some slight unintentional neglect; or has been opposed in argument on religious, political, or business matters, and thereby becomes offenderd, goes behind his opponent's back, and villainously and treach- erously slanders him he dares not meet vis a vis! The man who has in this manner defrauded his fel- low-man of reputation has beyond doubt committed a great crime, and should suffer severely for the base act. But he who slanders a lady's character, who causes a doubt to rest upon her virtue, commits a'crime so much more heinous, that no punishment is severe enough to atone for the wronyg. I am opposed to the practice of settling private quar- rels by resort to arms, for the settlement of the generality of disputes should be decided by courts of justice, but in cases of cowardly calumny, I am for withholding no means within one's reach to bring signal punishment on the guilty party. "And would you resort to slander?" asked Kate, "to force me to marry you against my will?" "I would resort to any means," answered the coward, "and therefore after your arrival at London, if you run A,-   OR THE DISINHERITED,     275 away and violate the promise-you have solemnly made, I will catse to be reported among your relatives and ac- quaintances, such reports that youswill ever afterwards be looked upon as a person fallen from purity. Your friends will shun you, and even William Colborn will forsake you, and point at you the finger of scorn." Kate and Rose burst into tears at the appalling pic- ture presented to their minds. Yes! these brave girls who had resisted the superior strength of armed men, and like lionesses defended themselves, the moment that venomous slander was suggested against them, shuddered and wept although perfectly innocent. "But," continued Fellows, " if you will keep your promise, go to my mother's and listen to her, I will not injure you by false accusations." "I will do it," said Kate in a firm voice, "And I, too," joined Rose. "Then I will immediately start for London," said he, and he ascended to the deck and gave the neces- sary instructions to Harvey.    . The Retreat was soon on her way, but as the wind proved unfavorable, several days elapsed ere she reached the Downs. However, she made good progress up the river, after entering it. A t length the well-known din of the metropolis fell welcome upon the prisoners' ears, and pushing open the door, they left the room they had so long occupied in misery. They still held within their firm grasp their pistols, and motioning Fellows to precede them, they followed him to the deck and over the side into the boat that waited to convey them to the landing. The hearts of the maidens leaped with joy as their eyes surveyed the land around, and contemplated the sky above them. Fellows was more than once tempted   , 276     LIEUTENANT COLBORN, to snatch away their pistols, and secrete the helpless fe- males in the sewer which has been heretofore referred to, as the boat passed by its entrance, but fearing their screams or the report of a pistol would attract atten- tion, he did not venture to carry any such scheme into effect. They reached the landing in safety, and walking up the steps, were mingled with numerous citizens. Kate was inclined to take advantage of this opportunity to effect their liberty, but she had promised him faithfully that she would accompany'him to his mother's, and felt In duty bound to-do so. Besides, she feared his slan- derous tongue! On reaching the street, they stepped into a close car- riage, and drove off; the girls thanking kind Providence for their safe arrival on shore, although they were not without fears of being conveyed to another prison, where they might be treated with still more cruelty. But they were encouraged by the sound of living thousands around them. The carriage drove to Mrs. Brady's. On descending they cast suspicious glances at the front of the dwelling, and fearing they might be again en- trapped, refused to enter. Fellows went in, however, and having embraced his mother, and explained hastily that he had brought with him his intended bride, was accompanied by her to the door. On beholding the benign and pleasant appearance of Mrs. Brady, and as her residence bespoke respectability, they no longer hesitated. Fellows introduced Kate as his intended bride, and Rose as her maid, and they were conducted into the house. They seated themselves, and having been relieved of their bonnets and shawls, entered earnestly into an apparently friendly conversation. The sight of one of   OR THE DISINHERITED.      2" their own sex, and a furnished room on shore, looked so natural to them, and they were so overjoyed, that the many injuries received were for the time being cast from their minds. "Judging from personal appearance,", said Mrs. Brady, "I should say you had made a good selection, my son." "There is no doubt upon that point,' said Fellows, "and I wish there were none on other points. The principal obstacle, dear mother, is, that we have had considerable. trouble between ourselves, and I beg you will intercede, and endeavor to bring about a reconcilia- tion between us."9 "Am I then to consider this as an elopement?" asked Mrs. Brady. "Not by any means," said Fellows. "I shall be most happy to intercede, if by so doing it will adjust your difficulties,"7 said Mrs. Brady in a kind manner. c, But first, please enlighten me about the unfortunate misunderstanding."' ' There has been no elopement, Madam," said Kate, "I should be very sorry to - " ' Hush,' -whispered Fellows, interrupting her. "But an abduction, madam!" continued Kate,  I am not here of my own free will."' "WLat does this mean, George?9 said Mrs. Brady. "I accidentally stopped at an inn at Plymouth,"' said Fellows, " kept by a Mr. Pederson, and becoming en- amored of this girl, his daughter, [ did all I could to win her affections, but in vain. I offered to-marry her, but she refused, as she was betrothed to a lieutenant in the navy, to whom, unfortunately, she is very much at- tached.  I became-wretched, and at last, when in an- other week, she was to become his bride, I was driven to abduct her--"   278       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Is it possible?" exclaimed Airs. Brady, interrupting him. "You have done wrong, George, I am very sorry for it." "To abduct her,'9 continued Fellows, " by decoy- ing her on board of my vessel, and sailing with her out to sea, treating her kindly, and bringing her herae." "Treating her kindly! exclaimed Rose. "Treating me kindly!" ejaculated Kate. "I regret this exceedingly,' said Mrs. Brady. "And is the object of my son's affections still unwilling to. make him happy by becoming his wife?9" "I cannot marry him!" replied Kate in a decided manner. "Then our business is at an end on this subject," said Mrs. Brady, " for certainly my son cannot expect to obtain a wife by force." "Then of course, Mr. Fellows," said Kate, rising, "according to our agreement, we are at liberty to go." "Who is Mr. Fellows?" asked the old lady in aston- ishment. "Your son!" said ]Rose, seeing Fellows making mo- tions for Kate to refuse to answer. "And who is the lady," asked Mrs. Brady, " that my son has unfortunately become so enamored of?" "I am the daughter of ,3lr. George Pederson," proudly answered Kate, " the keeper of an inn at Ply- mouth." The old lady wiped her glasses, and putting them on, gazed at the speaker. '"Have you seen her before, mother, that you stare so at her?" His mother did not answer, but continued her ques- tions to Kate. "Did your parents formerly reside in London?" "They did, madam."   OR THE DISINHERITED.      279 "Was your mother's name Lucretia?" Kate answered in the affirmative. "Have you a brother named Henry?" "I had; but we fear he has ben lost at sea." "Had you another brother? '? "I ha:d, madam, but he was taken from us, when an infant, a friend of my mother's adopted him." "And what was his name?" "George."'          ' The old lady arose from her chair, and said, "Your name must be Catharine! Is it not?" "It is, madam." Mrs. Brady then turning to her son, said, "You ought to be very thankful that there have been obstacles that have prevented your marriage, for this girl yozi so fondly love, and have so cruelly treated, is your sister " A cry of astonishment escaped from the lips of all at this most singular and sudden disclosure, and Kate sank into a chair, and buried her face in her kerchief. Fellows cast a look of surprise at Kate, then at his mother, and exclaimed, "It can not be possible! pshaw! nonsense! I do not believe it,!" lose, rising from her seat, and turning ashy pale at the disclosure, looked at Fellows, and said sarcastically, "Brother or not, if I were Kate, I would not own you!" "But it can not be possible!" cried Fellows. "You ,must be mistaken, mother! 1 will not believe it! Ex- plain yourself." "CMrs. Pederson was a good woman," said Mrs. 1Brady, and many happy hours have I spent in her so- ciety. Indeed, she swas my most intimate friend; forup- wards of four years we occupied the same house. I   280      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, had just lost an infant son, and your mother's life being despaired of, after she had given birth to you, I took you to my breast to nurse. Mrs. Pederson continued very ill. for many weeks; I kept you, George, and became very much attached to you, and begged I might keep you for my own. Your parents reluctantly granted my re- quest. I adopted you, George, and you took the sur- name of Brady. In course of time Mr. Pederson's family was increased by the birth of Henry and Cath- arine. A few years after, they remoed to Plymouth, since which time I have never had the pleasure of see- ing them. I occasionally heard from them until the de- mise of your mother, but have not since. Your father was a very fine man, a kind husband, an indulgent fa- ther, and a good neighbor. Is his health good now?" "He was quite well," answered Kate, " when we were separated, but I fear my absence in such a way will im- pair his health." "And is it my own father," exclaimed Fellows, "that I have treated so cruelly? But why did you not in- form me, mother? Why did you not tell me that I was your son only by adoption?  "Because I was at first jealous of your love, and thought it best to keep it- secret."  "Far better would it have been had you told me," said Fellows, mournfully, as he sank carelessly into a chair.  "Why did not Mr. Pederson inquire about your fam- ily?"' asked Mrs. Brady of her adopted son, " knowing that you had come from London. and that; your name was Brady?" "Because the villain took the name of Carey!" an- swered Rose, shaking her head. "Here is more mystery!" said Mrs. Brady, with a sigh.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     281 s Oh, wretch that I am!" cried Fellows, "to have treated my own father and sister so cruelly. Oh, dear sister, I have been so ungrateful that I hardly dare ask your forgiveness." And he covered his face with' his hands and wept. "He's making that," said Rose in derision, " for he is capable of anything that is bad and deceptive." ,Mrs. Brady was not aware of the reason why her son had changed his name to Fellows, nor yet why he had assumed the name of Carey. She was not aware that he had been a robber, a homicide, and guilty of many other heinous crimes. And now that a few of his atrocities were being divulged, injured in her feelings and pride, she frequently sighed and cast reproachful looks at him. Kate looked upon him with that pity one looks upon a lost, fallen friend, but she could not forgive him. None of the hundreds of causes which stimulate affection be- tween brothers and sisters had she known. She-had never played with, or fondled overjhim in childhood, nor known him as a brother since adult age. Hence it cannot be wondered that she cast upon him a cold look, and addressed her conversation to Mrs. Brady. Mrs. Brady took quite as great an interest in Kate, since the secret had been divulged, and declared she would take pleasure in doing all in her power to make the daughter of her old friends comfortable and happy. She threw off all reserve, and appeared more like a mother than a person they had never before known. She begged that they would be perfectly at home un- der her roof, and as supper was now announced; seated Kate by her side, and Iremarked that she wished her to remain weeks instead of days. The repast being finished, Kate asked for pen, ink) I38   282      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, , and paper, so that she might advise her father of her safety, and request him to send the news to William Colborn. Having written a letter, and sent it to the post, she retired to the chamber the good Mrs. Brady had pre- pared for her, and after kneeling humbly in thankful- ness to her Creator for preserving her through all the many dangers with which she had been surrounded, laid her head upon the pillow, and soon enjoyed the first safe and sound slumber she had known since she left the habitation of her father. -*   OR THE DISINHERITED,     283 CHAPTER XXXI. THE CHALLENGE. The schooner's cruise being ended, her commander hurried to London, and entered the great news room to ascertain if any information had been received touch- ing the discovery of the whereabouts of the Nancy, that prison of his lost love. He had not succeeded in ob- taining any news himself during his absence, excepting the false report given him by the brig Retreat, although he had searched very diligently by night and day for several weeks. But nothing was reported of the lost brigantine at the news room, and after hurriedly looking through the papers and lists, he descended to the street with a heavy heart. He walked carelessly-along, he knew not, and cared not whither, fearing the Nancy had gone to some distant country, and that he should never more see Kate. He was about to call for a carriage, when his eyes met those of a man he certainly had seen before. He looked again and exclaimed, "Can it be possible! the villain Carey?"It was indeed he, and William, carried away with rage, rushed upon him, seized him by the collar, and called out, "Villain! fiend! where is Miss Pederson and her servant?" ' They are safe and well at Mrs. Brady's," answered Follows calmly} " but before we proceed further in con-   284      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, versation, I have to request that you take your hand from my shoulder." " I will do it," said William, as he retreated from him, "for had I not been carried away with passion, I should not have stooped to chastise such a wretch with my bare hand, but should have blown out your brains, or given you in charge of the police at once." "Whether I am a wretch or not," said Fellows, "I have answered your question, and with civility, and con- sequently presume that I am at liberty to go." "Not by any means, not until I have had satisfaction for the injury you have done Miss Pederson." "And how do you intend to get satisfaction?" asked Fellows, " in an honorable manner, face to face, or by taking me unawares, and slaying me like a dog?" "By fighting you to your teeth, wretch! so prepare yourself! Let us go for weapons!" " "Come in here, then!" said Fellows, as he led the way into a respectable-looking coffee-house, "there are weapons here." "I see none," said Colborn, as they entered, and walked towards the counter. "Don't get excited, but take a seat, and we'll make all necessary preparations in a cool manner," said Fel- lows, and seating himself at a table, he called for drinks. "I told you there were weapons here," continued he, as he drew from his pockets a pair of loaded pistols, and coolly laid them on the table, " here they are, and as good ones as ever clicked. Now since you have challenged me, I am ready at a proper time to meet you; this is no new business to me, I have met men face to face in a similar manner before. Take your choice of these weapons, but the time for combat I shall reserve to appoint myself."   OR THE DISINHERITED.     285 6c Then you do not wish to meet me at once," said William.  "I do not," "And when will you?" "As soon as you have had an interview with Miss Pederson." Colborn became a little more composed, and de- manded where the lady could be seen. "At my adopted mother's.". u' How far is it?" ' About four miles." "Let, us go, then," said William, and after paying for the drinks - that, by the way, Colborn did not touch --they left the coffee-house, and sought a conveyance. "Enter that carriage!" said Colborn. a Gluddeus Place!" said Fellows to the driver, and soon the vehicle was rolling through the thronged thoroughfares of London.' The carriage stopped at the gate of Mrs. Brady's house, William surveyed the front of the building, and when the door wras opened, he refused to enter, fearing some trick might be played upon him. Fellows went in. and announced that Mr. Colborn was outside! at which Kate started from her seat, and flew to the door. Kate! William! was simultaneously ejaculated, as they clasped each other in their arms. But we will leave theim to love and privacy. Fellows informed his mother that in consequence of the person he had treated so cruelly, having proved to be his sister, he did not wish to ,rernmain longer where she was, and therefore should be absent until such time as Miss Pederson and Rose should depart. In going out he stopped at the door of the parlor, in   286.      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, which were his enemy and sister, and sent to Colborn a note to inform him that now he was in readiness to keep his word in regard to the shooting affair. William-having read the note, went into the hall and said calmly, that as circumstances had changed very materially the face of affairs, he would recall the threats he had uttered. "I shall never meet in combat," con- tinued he, " the brother of Kite. I bid you go in peace, and repent of your erroneous ways. I will never molest you." With these words he withdrew, -andclosed the door. Fellows being ashamed to meet again the females he had so badly treated, bade his mother adieu, and de- parted.   OR THE DISINHERITED,     287 CHAPTER     XXXII. THE LAST OF FELLOWS. Fellows roved through the streets of London an un- happy and friendless man. He thought gloomily of his hard fate, of having been so singularly disappointed in his hopes of becoming happy with Kate Pederson. It is true that he had wealth, and therefore need not fear actual want, but without some one to live for, no amount of wealth can make the mind of man happy. Besides, his conscience was far from being at rest, for the many injuries he had done to his fellow-men stared him in the face and troubled him. He tried to drive thought away in dissipation. He- attended a place of amusement, drank intoxicating beverages, and finally in the evening attended a dance. But all to no purpose: still he continued to be unhappy. He put up at an inn, and sent for Harv'ey to remain with him and keep him company. i Harvey," said he on the following morning, as the captain met him at his apartments, Lc I am really un- happy, for that girl is lost to me, she can never be my wife." "Force her to be, or punish her stubbornness by a worse fate -you have the power." "No! I am saved from such a sin - she is my sister." "Your sister!" exclaimed Harvey, in the greatest astonishment, "It can not be so." "It is too true," said Fellows, as he looked dolefully   288      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, at his companion. "But let us get away from this, and go somewhere and see something new. I must banish these gloomy feelings from my mind." '"As you please," replied Harvey, and they went out of the inn, and walked leisurely up the street. "I wish I had led a different life," said Fellows, "my conscience bothers me terribly." "Conscience! nonsense, man! If you had'nt lost the girl, you would'nt thus talk of conscience!" "But I can not help it," continued Fellows, and a shudder passed through his frame. "But let us go and see old Peg. It is a long time since I have called on the old hag; perhaps she can in some way relieve my dis- tress of mind."' So saying they started on their errand; they knocked at the door, and a poor, ragged girl let them in. "' Just the same as ever," said Fellows, " or rather worse. How is the old woman?" "The old woman is not here now," said the girl. "When did she leave? Where is she?" "She's been dead, sir, for some time!" "Indeed! And who lives here now?" "Nobody lives here," she replied, a' but our folks live next door." "Then let us be off," said Fellows to his companions, "old Peg's gone the long road;" and they again saun- tered up the street. They next visited thze lane, but here they found the narrow passage-way to the three houses he had once occupied, guarded by policemen. He did not like the appearance of these guardians of the peace; it looked as if a. close watch was kept upon the conduct of the inhabitants of the locality. On arriving at -the door of one of the before-described   OR THE DISINHERITED.     289 old and decayed houses, he knocked. The door was opened by a man who asked what was wanted. Fellows thinking he was one of the gang, asked for Hubert. "What do you wish of Hubert?" asked the man. "You need not put on any airs in this way, nor try to deceive me," said Fellows, "go and tell your master that an old friend is here."   -  "Walk in! walk in!" said the man quite humbly, now perceiving that they were two of the great band of rob- bers. They obeyed, and having seated themselves, waited for Hubert, whom the man had gone into the next room, as they supposed, to call. But an honest man was he, and on reaching the other room-he sent his son from the back door of the house to summon the police to arrest his two visitors. "Hubert is not here now," said he, as he entered the room where sat the visitors, after having waited as long as it would take his son to call the police. "Where is he?" asked Fellows, not liking the strange appearance of things in the house, where he had once been lord and master. "Where is he?" he repeated. "He was taken by the police," replied the other, "tried, and hanged." "What? Hubert hanged? How did the police take him?" "He and his followers were hunted down, -and all taken, and the leaders were executed," answered the man, hearing the approaching footsteps of the police- men, and growing more bold. "And who occupies these houses now?" asked Fel- lows, rising from his chair. "Respectable people, who have caught you in a trap!  replied the man, as the door opened and two policemen entered.    290      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, v So it appears," calmly remarked Fellows, always cool and ready'for any emergency. "What's wanted here?" demanded the policemen. "Here are two suspicious persons," said the man, "they have acknowledged being acquainted with Hubert, and have come here to see him, apparently ignorant that Hubert had been arrested and hanged." "Then you are our prisoners," said the policemen, turning to them, a so come along with us! 9 and the po  licemen stepped forward as if to seize them. At/this instant Fellows touched a well-known spring, that still remained as when he had lived in the house, and quick as thought a concealed door flew open, and he leaped without ado into the darkness below, and Harvey did not fail to follow him. It was done so sud- denly that the policemen had not time to arrest either of them; .but rushing to the trap-door, they were cha- grined to find it had fallen into its place, and become so firm that they could not re-open it. "They are out-generaled this time,' said Fellows, as he touched the spring of another door, that let them out into an alley leading to the grand subterranean passage. "I am astonished," said the man of the house to the policemen, " that such a trap-door is in my floor." The policemen looked at him suspiciously. "This will not do, my good man," said their spokesman, " we are not to be taken in by so silly a bait as this. We must arrest you, sir." "Me!" cried the' poor mari, "I declare I did not know that they could escape through my floor. And I was as much astonished as yourselves to see them dis- appear. Oh, my good sirs, don't arrest me, I am quite innocent of all knowledge of the two men, or the trap- door." "Come along with us!" was the stern reply. -.-   OR THE DISINHERITED.,     291 "Oh, listen to reason!" cried the man, while a chilly sensation stole through his frame at the thought of be- ing arraigned before a magistrate as acting in concert with robbers. "If I were guilty would I have sent my ' son to inform you that there were two suspicious look- ing men in my house?"         - "Sure enough," said one of the policemen, " he is in- nocent. But let's lose no time searching for the men who are guilty." The trap-door was re-opened by means of tools, and taking with them lights, they descended. On reaching the ground, they could discover no means of egress, as the other trap-doors had been arranged so artfully. that they could be discovered only by breaking through, or entirely demolishing the partitions. In the meantime Fellows and Harvey following the passage reached the river, and engaging a boat were conveyed to the Retreat, then moored at buoys down the stream towards Blackwall. "Success to our pursuers! They will have to look some time before they discover us," said Harvey, de- scending with Fellows to the little cabin. Yes," joined Fellows, " and if they are not very care- ful they will never find their way out again. But I am astonished that Hubert should have managed so badly as to be taken with his followers by the police." "I am not surprised in the least at it," said Harvey,. "-but wonder how you escaped their vigilance so long, when you held the position you gave to Hubert." "I was always on the alert." "True enough," said Harvey, " but the fact is, the band under any leader could not have existed long in the midst of so-many people who were opposed to it, and I think if you had not abandoned it when you did, yoti would have shared the fate of tIubert."   292,      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "'And I think it would have been about as W-ell," said Fellows, " for I am now very unhappy." "You must give over such feelingos," said Harvey. "I have less power to do so now than before," replied Fellows. "My former friends and associates have been hung or otherwise punished; no doubt it was through my influence that some of them were led into their evil ways; I am in some degree responsible for their mis- demeanors and consequent punishment. Furthermore, my ill-gotten wealth which I depended upon for future happiness, does not give it." "These feelings will wear off by-and by," said Har- vey, and turning to his state-room, bade him good night. Fellows passed the night in a wretched state of mind. ' Morning came, and after breakfast he resolved to quit the brig and London forever. "Harvey,7 -said he, "I have thought of everything through the night, for I have not slept a wink, and I have resolved to leave you forever." 1 The skipper looked at him to read if he was in ear- nest, and said, "I hope not forever, my friend." "Yes, forever. I am unhappy." "But seek the hand of another lady, banish this one from your mind, and you will then be again happy." "It is not the circumstance of the lady only that makes me miserable, although if it had not been for that I certainly would not be so wretched," "There are many pretty women in this wide world," observed Harvey. "I am aware of that," said Fellows, "' but none like her." ' You will think differently, my friend, when you be- come in love with another.",  *    OR THE DISINHERITED.     293 "Ah! I shall never love another. My heart has no longer any tender emotions to waste on others. I am going to leave you. I owe you some money, probably half the value of- the brig, do I not?" "Not as much as that, my friend." "Well then," said Fellows, " as you have served me well, and as I have always found you worthy, I will present you with the brig as a payment for your serv- ices." "Oh! my friend, it is too great a present, but almost valueless if you are to leave me forever." "There is some money in the room there - that un- fortunate room - which I wish you to divide amongst  the crew of the vessel as a token of my esteem for them." "It shall be duly attended to." "Now, Harvey, I bid you farewell."' Oh, do not here. Allow me to go with you, or at least to accompany you through the city." "No! I arm unhappy, and wish to go alone. My advice- to you is to seek an honorable employment with your vessel, and never more do as we have done, for depend upon it, Harvey, if you continue to do wrong, your conscience will smite you in the end. Adieu!" Having thus spoken, he pressed the hand of his com- panion, and silently descended the ladder to the boat. On landing he threw a purse of gold into the boat to the crew, and bidding them farewell, entered a carriage, and drove to Mrs. Brady's. ' Mother," said he as he entered, "I am come to visit you for the last time. Are the girls here yet?" His mother answered in the affirmative. "Then I will not remain," he replied, '"I have wronged them, and all I can now do is to ask their forgiveness,   294      LIEUTENANT COLBORN,  but I can not meet them even for this, so do you ask it for me. I shall now go away, mother, and you will see me no more." "Nonsense!" cried Mrs. Brady, " you are talking at random." "I mean what I say, mother, for where is the use of my remaining here any longer? I shall only make you as unhappy as I am now myself." "Why do you wish to abandon me in my old age? Why are you unhappy with your best friend? Why not remain with me until you marry?" "I shall never marry! I shall never look again in the face of woman. I have treated one so villainously, and she my own sister, that I can never forgive myself." And he covered his face with his hands, and sobbed. "But you did not know it was your sister," said Mrs. Brady, now trying to console him, " you did not know it, and she will no doubt overlook the offense. Come, give over this melancholy mood, and forget the past in repentance." "I never can," said Fellows, "I feel like a lone and friendless man, although surrounded by many; I feel poor, although I am wealthy; I feel and know I am wretched.  Mother, adieu!" and in spite of her remon- strances to his going, and her exertions to stay him, he, l with a hasty tread, reached the outer door, saying, "Dear mother, this is the last y6u will ever see or hear of me - farewell!" and never afterwards was the singu- larly bad man seen or heard of!   OR THE DISINHERITED.     295 C HAPTE     XXXIII. THE RESIGNATION. William Colborn had for a long time been much dis- pleased with the tyrannical rules of the navy, and with the many unjust acts of the government. He had often been obliged to issue orders on board ship that were unjust. He had witnessed shameful impositions of the strong upon the weak, and could enumerate many in- stances of plunder on the land, as well as on the sea, by naval forces. He blushed for his country when he read of the conduct of George the Third and his ministers toward the loyal inhabitants of her thirteen colonies in America; and when harsh treatment drove these colo- nies to revolt, he exulted in all their successes. His sympathies had been so strong with them when a boy at school, indeed, that had he been a man at that time, he would doubtless have gone to America, and joined them in their struggle for independence. But more than all, he had of late been disgusted with the commanders of British ships of war, on account of their arrogant and insulting manner of treating the officers of American merchant ships, and because of their press- ing from American vessels, seamen who were citizins of an independent nation, acknowledged such by Great Britain herself. In the face of this acknowledgment, and of a sacred treaty of peace, her fleets were even then chasing American ships, and often bringing them to; and British officers were in the habit of lording it   296      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, over American crews, in a manner not only contrary to the custom of navies and nations, but in defiance of the plainest demands of eight. Lieutenant Colborn could not approve of those un- just acts of his government. So opposed was he to a mean or wrong action, that nothing, even his strong feelings of patriotism, could cause him longer to assist either directly or indirectly any tyrannical acts of the government. He also believed that nations and individuals ought to observe their treaties and promises sacredly, yet England had broken hers like threads. Her plea for breaking them with France was that the people-had placed the talented Napoleon at their head instead of submitting to the rule of the imbecile Bourbon, Louis; the former being immediately from the people, and ple- beian ; the latter from the oppressors of the people, but royally begotten. The'first an honorable man, and de- scended from respectable ancestors; the other, a defiled and detestable roue, and descended from a line of royal profligates. England has gained nothing by the active part she took to restore the fallen Bourbons, but on the contrary, now finds when it .is too late, that she acted wrongly, and can only look back and curse her ministers for in- creasing to a frightful sum an almost overwhelming na- tional debt. And po matter how much it may be de- plored by the friends of liberty that the First Consul of France ruined the cause of the people and himself, by sacrificing all to his ambition, yet it is plain that the ob- ject of his enemies in all the bloody wars, before and after the treaty of Amiens- wars that will forever be a stain on the pages of European history--was the re- placement of a Bourbon on the throne of France, there-   OR THE DISINHERITED.     297 by to crush the spirit of republicanism. And although forests of bayonets, aided by treachery, after the terri- ble and unprecedented disaster to Napoleon caused by the snows of Russia, had unfortunately restored a Bour- bon to the throne of-France in opposition to the wishes of the nation; yet that base act will forever be a pow- erful argument against the rule of such imbeciles, and against all tyrannical forms of government. Oh, France'! great France! oh noble Frenchmen! you have been wronged, deceived! The liberties your enemies enjoyi, they owe to your great fathers' inde- pendence- and heroism in the ever memorable struggle of 1789; for had the English Channel been as broad as the Atlantic ocean, the noble principles that inspired them to accomplish stupendous deeds, would have crossed the liquid abyss, and penetrated the hearts of the masses of the people. May you still hold to what your fathers fought and bled for, to keep forever from your head any but a de- scendant of a greater than Coesar, that you may not again fall into the grade of poverty and imbecility. And should you again be molested, may you never waver from those principles your fathers maintained, but ever cling to what God has freely given, sacred and just rights to man. The Race Horse was now ordered to proceed to sea to join the squadron stationed on the American coast, for the purpose of searching American vessels, and re- claiming deserters from England's navy, who, it was said, had by hundreds joined the vessels of the republic. The lieutenant became extremely dissatisfied at this announcement. He would much rather have gone on another cruise in the Pacific in search of mutineers, rath.

He had also just had the good fortune to meet Kate, and to be torn froml her so soon was not to be endured. Under these circumstances he was sure it became his duty to resign unless he could obtain a transfer to an. other ship on another station. He made the applica- tion, but as he could produce no satisfactory reason for such a change, it was not granted. Had his request been complied with, there is no doubt that he would hav'e remained in the navy longer. Having weighed well the matter in his own mind, he at length made his final decision, and wrote a letter con- taining his resignation to the admiralty, and abandoned the service forever.   OBR THE DISINHERITED.     299 CHAPTER XXXIV. THE NEW HOMEo No news had yet reached Mr. Pederson of his daugh- ter's safety. He still mourned her loss, although in the very agreeable society of his friends at the village, at times his heart-felt grief was partially forgotten. Tired of the inactive life he was leading, he began to think of looking about him to see if he could not find some kind of business to occupy his mind.- He did not succeed at first, but at length the thought occurring to him, that it would be a good pastime to try some agri- cultural pursuit, he inquired if there could not be ob- tained a small tract of land in or about the village at a reasonable price. A small farm some four miles distant was said to be for sale, and he resolved to look at the said property, the first opportunity. Mentioning the matter to a friend who was well acquainted with the value of land, the two procured a carriage, and drove over to see the place. It was a pleasant drive from the village to the old farm-house, which was .situated on the western part of the farm, and distinctly seen from any part of Esk. The old house did not seem very inviting; it was much out of repair externally, and did not seem much better within. In looking around nearly all of the land was shown to be uncultivated, and many parts of it were quite bar- ren. The eastern portion was swampy, with here and   300      LIEUTENANT COLBORNI there a hill partly enshrouded with woods; but the timber to all appearance was of little value, and indeed, the entire farm, unless a considerable sum should be laid out, and a great deal of manual labor expended upon it, in clearing up the woods, and draining the swampy por- tions, could not be expected to be at all productive. But around the old house were a few patches of land which were cultivated, and seemed to be of more value than all the rest. Mr. Pederson shook his head as with his friend he wandered from one part to another. "It is cheap enough," said he, "and in fact it ought to be, for everything looks to be almost wild." "It has been neglected, very much neglected, in fact has been suffered to go to wreck," said his companion as he looked around, but with far different ideas of its value from those of Mr. Pederson, "However," ex- claimed he, "labor and some little expense would put things all to rights again." "It would require too much labor and too much ex- pense," said Mr. Pederson, "for me to undertake to clear it up."              .  "I thought you wanted to labor," remarked his com- panion, "for you have been complaining about being idle for some time, and as for expense, I do not think money would be lost in laying it out on this farm, but -on the contrary, I think it would be a good investment." "You do?" said Mr. Pederson in astonishment, " and how would you think of laying out money here?," "Well, in the first place, a thousand pounds would make a different looking house from that, anrid clear up all around the gardens, and make new hedges." "A thousand pounds!" exclaimed Mr. Pederson, " a thousand pounds is a large sum to be laid out on an old house and its gardens."   , OR THE DISINHERITED,     301 "Bat supposing that when a thousand are spent upon it, the property becomes two thousand pounds more valuable?" observed his companion. "And do you think such would be the case?" asked Mr. Pederson. "I do, sir." "Then you approve of purchasing the property?" "Yes, providing you want a farm like this," said the other, " for you never could get one cheaper." "But fifty acres seems to be much more than I want. I only require a small piece of ground." "But what signifies it so long as you get it cheap! Have you any objection to becoming possessed of more wealth than you now have?" "Of course not," replied Mr. Pederson with a smile. "But do you really think the farm is cheap at the price?" "As cheap as dirt, sir. Besides when you offer to lay down a thousand for it, I am of opinion that they will take it." After some further deliberation, the price having been reduced considerably, he purchased the farm. Carpenters were soon at work at the old house, and laborers at the gardens and around the grounds, and under Mr. Pederson's superintendence, things soon as- sumed a better aspect, while the mind of the new pro- prietor became more and more at ease. However, even the change from a life of, idleness to one of industry could not erase the image of his lost daughter from his memory, and he passed many hours. in silent grief. Upon one of these occasions of depres- sion, a letter was handed him, and on opening it, he found that it was penned by his darling Kate! He read and re-read its contents, and was so overjoyed   302      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, that he hardly, knew what he was about. But he at once concluded to -Visit London, and that as soon as possible, to meet his beloved daughter. When he entered the stage that was to convey him to London, it was remarked that he appeared to look ten years younger than he did that morning. He ar- rived in London, and found the house of Mrs. Brady. Kate and Rose of course were overjoyed to see him! They rushed towards himr, exclaimning, "Father!I "Master!"Mr. Pederson!"   The old man did not Ospeak, bt clasped his daughter to his heart, and burst into tears. At length he placed his hands upon her head, and gave thanks to his Creator for thus blessing him with the restoration of his child. Kate, also, did not fail to utter a silent prayer of thanksgiving that their re-union had been brought about, and Mrs. Brady and Rose joined with them. Next to the joy of this happiness, Mr. Pederson ex- perienced much pleasure in the society of his old friend Mrs. Brady, whom he had not had the pleasure, of meet. ing for many years. On the following day the two old friends were seated for a long time in earnest conversa- tion upon past scenes and events, and Rose inquired roguishy of Kate, if they were not in' love with -each other. "Nonsense!" exclaimed Kate, rather piqued at her maid's presumptuousness, "father will never marry again. They are old friends, and their respective fami- lies resided in the same house for many years, and were upon very intimate terms. But although they may not be in love, I know one Hthink who is!" "Who may it be?" asked Rose. "Yourself! was the reply. (   OR THE DISINHERITED.     303 '"Me! Miss Pederson!" "Yes, you! You think, perhaps, I have not noticed how quickly you have taken to Martin." "Why! Miss Pederson!" and Rose's plump neckl turned crimson, and no doubt her face, but that could not be seen, for she had turned away from her mis- tress. Kate was in reality a mistress to Rose, but she sel- dom showed her authority over her, as Rose had been long in the family, was kind, and never attempted to be too familiar; and then fate had so lately thrown them together as prisonters under such peculiar circumstances, that they had necessarily become somewhat familiar in their conversation with each other. ' You have no occasion to turn from me and blush so, Rose," said Kate, ." for I can assure you I approve of your attachment. He is a fine, honest man, and no doubt would make you a good husband." "s Husband -  Miss Pederson! You don't think I wish a husband!" "All women do, you are not an exception," was the reply. "But I have a good home with you, and,do not wish to leave it." Kate smiled-at the artful manner her maid avoided t an acknowledgment of her affections, and considering it natural, made no further observation. Martin, servant to Colborn, was a trusty man, and much confidence was placed in him by his master. He had. accompanied William to Mrs. Brady's only twice, yet he had not failed to look into Rose's bright eyes, nor had she into his, and that mysterious language that speaks in the countenance had informed them that each loved the other.           ;   304      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Colborn was ushered into the parlor where he was soon joined by Kate. At this time Martin stood in the hall chatting with Rose, and although he ,was quite reserved in his ad- dresses to her, yet the blushes came to her face, as if she were guilty of a misdemeanor in loving him. William had invited his intended bride to visit the Tower and other places of amusement, and as with a light heart she bounded out of the parlor to make her toilet, she' came unexpectedly upon the lovers in the hall. Rose endeavored to escape towards the kitchen, and Martin walked hastily out of the door and closed it behind him. "Now, Rose! . I have caught you!" said Kate with a smile. "You don't fall in love! You don't want a husband, for you have a good home with me! ha! ha! But I am glad to see it, only it is really a pity you must stand here in the hall, when there are so many rooms in the house. A room is more appropriate, so I'll ask per- mission for you to invite your beau into a room, that you can do your courting in a respectable manner!" "As you do, Miss Pederson." "DMrs. Brady! Mrs. Brady!" cried Kate, "Rose wishes  " U Oh! Miss Pederson! would you expose me?" P"No, Rose, I will not. I see that I am going too far with the -joke. But do not be alarmed to have me meet you with your lover, for I will not oppose the match." Rose did not speak, but a look of gratitude was not unnoticed by her mistress. As Kate was adjusting her toilet for the visit to the Tower, she could not but contrast her situation now, with what it had been but two weeks previous, and   O- THE DISINHERITED.     305 having again thanked Providence for her escape, and asked devoutly for future protection, she descended, and having been assisted into a carriage by her lover, was whirled away through crowded streets, yet they were alone, The carriage reached Tower-Hill, and she requested to stop, having a serious-curiosity to see the place where so much blood had been unnecessarily spilt; where so many innocent heads had been severed from their bodies for the maintenance of crowns and religious supersti- tion.  Before them rose that combination of castles, turrets, spires, and fortifications, encircled by its walls and moats, and truly had it a solemn aspect in their sight, as the many cruel acts committed therein flashed across their minds. They drove to the moat, crossed the bridge, and con- ducted by a guide, entered the armory department, where were '-statues encased in steel, representing the sovereigns and leading warriors of England for cen- turies back. The dungeon that for twelve long years had contained the person of Sir Walter Raleigh was an object of peculiar and melancholy interest to them. Next they were shown to the apartment where were keptthe crown jewels. Thatsuch immense wealth should be kept merely to look at,did really seem a pity. Then they entered the torture-room. Worse and worse! William and Kate wished to see no more. They were disgusted, and left immediately for Mrs. Brady's. "And so I suppose we are to go to Plymouth no more, father," said Kate on the following morning, as they arose from the breakfast-table. "Plymouth is not to me what it once was." I4*   306   *   LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "No, my dear, I do not think I shall ever get -over the feeling of antipathy which I experienced on being landed there after that awful scene on board the Nancy. Besides, I am so well pleased with Esk and my farm, that I am sure I shall never wish to remove again." "Is the house large?" she asked, "is it airy and roomy, or is it low-roofed and contracted, like our old house?" "The house is large enough, my dear, but plain, quote plain. A country house with rural comforts, but when you see it, you will be pleased, I am sure." "Oh! I long to see it so much, father. I think I shall be pleased with a country life." -When the time arrived for their departure, Kate an- nounced to her father that she could not persuade MArs. Brady to accompany them.  fMr. Pederson regretted this as he had expected that she would spend several wees with them at Esk, but as she had not traveled so far for many years, she could not be persuaded to leave London. The carriage was ordered to convey them to' Green- wich, wherethey were to take the stage for the inte- rior. On reaching the stage office at Greenwich, Colborn and Martin were observed waiting to see them off, and to say farewell. The time for the starting of the stage was nearly up, but William used that little to the best advantage, by promenading with Kate on the green in front of the office. Martin dared not be so bold, but now and then he walked toward Rose as if determined to offer his arm, or say something to her, yet his courage was not equal to the emergency. The time soon came round for the coach to depart; j I f o    OR THE DISINHERITED,     307 Kate was assisted into it by William, and as Mr. Pe- derson invited him to visit them soon, Kate observed Rose looking disconsolately, and cried out, "Be sure to bring Martin with you!" Farther conversation was cut off by the announce- ment, "Stage ready!" and they drove off. The outskirts of the village of Esk became visible from the stage as it ascended a hill on the fourth day after their departure from Greenwich. The old gentle- man smiled as he looked at those well-known hills. The coach moved on, and presently his house could be seen at a distance, and he pointed it out to his daughter and Rose. They beheld a cottage surrounded by trees, and sit- uated apparently upon an eminence. An elevated plain appeared beyond it, as having on its north border a hill, beyond which was an extensive wood, and on the south a pond with here and there a tree upon its edge. "What a delightful place!" exclaimed Kate, " and oh!" she continued, as they came in sight of Esk, " what a beautiful village!" "How, do you like the appearance of things here, Riose?" asked Mr. Pederson, highly pleased to find that his, daughter was so delighted. "Very much, sir," she replied respectfully, " but any place would suit me where you and Miss Pederson are."             "And where Martin is to be," said Kate, casting a sidelong glance at Rose. Rose colored, and was about tp speak when Mr. Pe- derson interrupted her by saying, "What's this about AMartin?" She remained silent, but placing her forefinger on her lips,-looked earnestly at her mistress.   808       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, Kate understood her-- "Don't you tell "--and an- swered her father that Martin would no doubt come with his master. "Oh, yes! of course he will," said he, " but here we are at the village." The coach drove up to the inn and stopped, and kind friends met them and proffered their hospitalities, but after partaking of a sumptuous dinner with his old friend, the host, they entered Mr. Pederson's own car- riage, and whirled away by his high-spirited horse, soon reached the farm-house. "I have slept out here but twice," said he, "I prefer. red being at the inn with my friend, rather than here alone, but now that you are with me, I shall be most happy to remain here.  The furniture and all my things, as well as yours, arrived some time ago, and all that remains to do is to put them to rights." In a few days the good house-keeping qualities of Kate and Rose had arranged the furniture, carpeting, bedding, wardrobes, crockery, etc., so tastefully that all parts of the cottage looked cosey and inviting. The house was of one story, but large on the ground. In the front which faced the south, a small, tasty portico protected the principal entrance, up the sides of which ran a thick fqliage of woodbine, which, climbing un- der and over and uniting above, ascended and spread over the roof of the cottage, far above the attic win- dows. On the right was a room of more than ordinary di- mensions, considering the size of the building. It was simply furnished, having a plain carpet, a stand on which -were arranged the Bible and other books, and at either end a large arm-chair, a sofa, a mirror, a few ch-airs, and window hangings oftasty muslin.   OR THE DISINHERITEDo     309 On the left was-a room furnished with equal plain- ness of the same size. On the north was all addition, where the floor of the kitchen, with frequent scrubbing, was almost white as snow. ' A door on each side of this addition opened into the clean, grassy yard, which was divided only from the vegetable garden by a thick hedge. Different kinds of fruit trees spread their waving branches over the nu- merous flower beds in the front yard, which was also surrounded by a thick hedge. The road leading to the village ran past the cottage quite convenient. There was a fiV view in nearly all directions from the windows, and, taken all together, it was as pleasant a spot as could have been selected, and the girls were highly pleased with their new home. *^ ,              -      310      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, CHAPTER    XXXV., THE DISCOVERY. Winter's cold blasts "had passed away, and the green grass and all kinds of vegetation had begun to spring up, as if glad again to bring forth for the benefit of man. Thousands of birds that had flown far south to escape the frigidity of the winter season, had now returned, and were singing in sweet tones their songs of thank- fulness- that the spring-time of flowers and love had come again! Kate and Rose had been anxiously wishing for the appearance of their lovers, and time always passes heav- ily with those who are waiting some expected pleasure. "Here comes father at last," said Kate, in a tone of disappointment as she walked toward the window, "and alone! I declare it is too bad." "What's too bad?" asked Rose. "Oh, nothing!' replied she, peevishy. Rose laughed and bounded into the kitchen. Kate met her father at the door, and assisted him off with his coat; she had hoped that he would not come home alone, but in that she was disappointed. "Come, Rose! put the-tea-things on the table." "What's the matter, Kate?" asked Mr. Pederson as they seated themselves at the table, "you appear quite sad. And you, Rose, you appear dejected. What's the matter? s'  q  jH it   OR THE DISINHERITED.      3" The roll of an approaching carriage put a stop to fur- ther conversation; it drew up at the door, and Colborn and his servant descended, and it is hardly necessary to say that all signs of sadness instantaneously left the fea- tures of Miss Pederson and her maid, and were replaced by pleasant and happy smiles. Kate received William in the parlor, while Martin ran around the house, and entered the kitchen. Rose met him with such a winning smile that he was tempted to kiss her, but here again his courage was not equal to the task, so he only shook her hand, while she thought, "what a fool he must be to think I would'nt let him." "You are just in time," said Mr. Pederson, as he shook William heartily by the hand, " come this way, and take a seat at the table." After tea he was shown through the house, every part of which was as neat as a perfect house-keeper like Kate Pederson could make it. Then he and Kate sauntered through the garden to survey the flower-beds, and finally seated themselves under a favorite tree, where they might enjoy a quiet tete-a-tete and the country air undisturbed. Rose meanwhile took the liberty to seat Martin oppo site herself at the tea-table, and they enjoyed themselves as cosily as if the cottage 'belonged to them. Hav- ing finished their supper, Rose pitt away the tea-things, and taking a pail on her arm, went out, saying to Mar- tin, "I am going to milking." "And where is the cow?" "In the pasture." "Shall I assist you to find her?" A good-natured "As you please," was her reply. Martin at first dared not follow her for fear of being seen by his master and the other folks, but Rose looked   312      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, back so earnestly that he could not refrain. He, how- ever, took another direction, as by entering the wood and taking a circuitous route he could meet her beyond the plain. "I wonder he does not come after me, I almost asked him to, but yet he is so very odd, so full of fear and bashfulness that it is really provoking. Yet I think he's in love with me, his actions sometimes betray it. What can I do to let him know that two are in love! But I must lessen my pace or I shall get out of sight of the house. Now how a man can be so dull as to refuse to take a hint without a kick, I really can not see, yet so it is. But if he ever looks at me again so loving as - he did to-day, I will kick him till he takes,-" "Who's that you are going to kick?" cried Martin, as he emerged from a thicket beside her. "Oh! ah! why the cow!" replied Rose with a laugh, "for she's always far from the house when I wish to milk her." "But I'll find her for you," said Martin, wishing to make a sort of apology for his appearance. "Thank you," said the maid, " and I'll do as much for you sometime." And they proceeded, across the plain towards the pond. "We expected Mr. Colborn two days ago," said Rose. "Did you? And did you look for me also?" -"See those ducks there on the pond," said Rose, wishing to evade a direct answer, " don't they sit pretty on the water?" "Oh, yes I and, here is a boat too! Can we not row in her?" "Yes; I often do, and so does Miss Pederson. It is a nice amusement, and as the water is not deep, it is quite safe to venture out upon the pond."   The boat was a short, wide affair, well calculated to row about in shoal water, and seating themselves on the thwarts, and each taking an oar, they propelled her from the shore. "When I am on the water," said Rose, "' I always think of my imprisonment on board of that hated ves- sel." "' It must have been awful,7" answered Martin, resting his oar, " the rascal ought to have been hanged." "Hush!" said Rose, " he is Miss Pederson's brother, and she wishes the circumstance to be mentioned no more." "( But he is not your brother, Rose, and- " "Still," said she, interrupting him, (' still I do not wish his name mentioned again." "Then," said he, " if you wish it, let the subject drop." They chased the ducks, pulled' the boat from shore to shore, splashed the water with their hands, and then returned on shore. The cow was found and milked, and as it was not yet quite dark, Rose seated herself upon the ground to rest, while Martin walked to and fro by her side, talking about this and that and almost everything but what she wanted to hear. '"What do I care," she thought, " about trees, hedges, clouds, sky, and all this! I wish he would tell me he loves me." But he did not seem to know that he was backward, but actually thought he was doing the amiable in pay- ing every proper respect to the fair maiden. , How does your hat -look on my head?" said she, as she took it from his -hand, and adjusted it over her thick braids of hair. "It becomes you well," replied he, as he stepped back to view her.   314     - LIBUTSNANT COL1BORN "I declare the man's a fool!" said she to herself, as she threw back his hat, and arose to depart, " he's a real dunce, and I'll not love him any more, I declare I will not," and she pouted in silence on their way back to the cottage, and as they entered it, a cheerful laugh from their master and mistress, who were walking among the trees, told them that they were noticed. But however Martin and Rose might get along, Kate had no reason to complain of a want of tokens-of affec, tion from her lover. Meantime Mr. Pederson was very much engaged in tilling the ground, and making improvements about the house and garden. He had hired farm laborers, and et purchased a team  and all necessary farming utensils, and appeared quite happy with his new pursuit.  He was often far away from the house, either on one part of his land or another, and although he did little or no work himself, he took great pleasure in superin- tending everything. In the course of his improvements, Nlis attention was devoted to the woody portions of his farm, and he com- menced here and there felling trees, and clearing up the land to be planted in future seasons. Himself and two hired men were engaged in felling a tree one morning. The laborers were taking turns at the axe, and Mr. Pederson sat upon a stump near at hand. "Wait a little, my good men, and rest; it's hard work to swing an ape," said Mr. Pederson. "By Jove! but this is a tough tree," said one of the men, passing the axe to his companion. "Tough!" said the other, also taking a seat at the invitation of his employer, "I never saw but one tree as hard as this, and that they gave up, and let her stand." e.1i,                   *   OR THE DISINUIERITEDo     315 6 But we can not give up this one," said Mr. Peder- son, " for it is in our way, and must be removed." ' Well, then! here goes again," said the one with the axe, and sending it deeper into the wood at every stroke, chip after chip told materially upon the huge butt of the tree. ' What kind of an oak is this?" asked the old gen- tleman. "Black oak, sir," answered the striker, and as hard as lignum vitae," and wetting his hands, he recommenced at the task.. l' This is an old tree?" observed Mr. Pederson. "Yes, sir, older than either of us," said one of the la- borers. "To what age do you imagine a tree lives?" asked the other. ' For centuries. I have seen a tree that is known to have existed for two centuries, and I am of opinion that some trees are capable of enduring the ravages of time for a much longer period." "By thunder!" said the striker, as a cut showed the heart of the tree, " a-half-o'ye is under, and here goes for the first chip from the other side." At last they reached the heart on that side also. "You had better walk away, Mr. Pederson, for it is difficult to say which way it will fall," said one of the men. The old gentleman walked away to the distance of a few hundred feet, and took a seat. In a few minutes that huge trunk that for a century had scarcely moved, tottered as if balancing to keep its upright posture, then fell to the ground with a tremen- dous crash, its immense limbs catching against and bear- ing down the branches of other trees that stood in its way,   316      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "She's down at last," tid one of the men as he leaped upon the trunk just above where it had splintered at its base. "But what is this?" asked Mr. Pederson as he came up, "A pistol, as I live!" "And here's another in this hollow here!" and as he spoke he mounted the tree and walke'd along its body. "Good heavens!" cried the men in surprise, " pistols in this tree! What can it mean?" "By Jupiter!" exclaimed the old gentleman, "' here's money!" and as he spoke he reached his hand into the hole, and took out a piece of gold and a little package. The trio stared at each other in great astonishment. "By the city of Perth!" cried Mr, Pederson in still greater amazement, " here are diamonds!" "I Diamonds!" exclaimed the men simultaneously, gazing with wonder upon the sparkling brilliants before them. "Cut down here," said the old gentleman, " and let us reach the bottom of the hollow." They began, and as the cavity was near the sur- face it was soon penetrated, and as it was opened all along, the treasures deposited there by Fellows and Fletcher were all discovered. Having taken them from the tree, they proceeded to the cottage. All were of course very much astonished, and won- dered who could have concealed them there, but finally it was conceded it must have been done by robbers. The packages were all opened, and disclosed to view rings] bracelets, bieastpins, etc., studded with diamonds of great value. And when taken to the cottage, all was commotion, as may well be presumed, and soon the news spread far over the country of the strange manner in which Mr. Pederson had becodie a wealthy man.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      317 CHAPTER XXXVI. THEE MARRIAoE. The sun rose on the morning of the first of June, 180-, throwing his golden rays uninterrupted by a cloud, upon the village of Esk, the surrounding hamlets, hills, and plains. The family of Mr. Pederson were no longer in bed, for the happy day that had been determined upon for the marriage of William and Kate had arrived. It was early, yet no appearance within the walls of the house showed that the inmates had just arisen, for every room had been swept, every bed re-made, and the furniture dusted and polished.    ' Rose and the assistant cook were busy making prep- arations for the marriage breakfast, that was to come off at noon, and the arrival of friends and other unusual occurrences, gave an appearance of extraordinary cheer- fulness to the house and household. Taking a peep into Kate's chamber, we see everything neatly arranged. The bed and window curtains, cov- erings of the toilet stand and chairs, are of spotless i white dimity, the carpet green and white of a delicate pattern, fresh bouquets tastefully arranged by Kate's own hands are placed here and there about the room; the bridal dress is thrown across the bed, and orange blossoms preparatory for the bridal toilet. The lovers had been previously disturbed, and very much disappointed, inr their matrimonial preparations,   318      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, but all obstacles had been overcome, and now no bar. riers interfered with their coming nuptials. At the hour of nine the carriages that were to convev the small bri- dal party to the village church had arrived. William waited upon Kate from the house, and placed her tenderly in the carriage. Her two child-like bridesmaids, grand-daughters of two of her father's old friends of the village, followed, attended by two young gentlemen as groomsmen, who were officers in the navy and friends of William. Mr. Pederson and a few of his old friends and school- mates next followed. As they neared the village, the notes of the marriage bells fell pleasantly upon their ears; and soon the church inwhichthe ceremony was to be performed was reached. Never did bridegroom look more happy than William, and never bride more loving and lovely than Kate as he led her to the altar. She was dressed with her nat- ural elegant taste, in a white silk, covered with rich, light lace with veil to match, which was attached to a delicate wreath of orange blossoms. None of the rich jewels she had lately been piesented with did she wear, excepting-the necklace and bracelet, selected from the costly set of pearls William had brought her as a bridal present, which adorned her rounded white neck arid arms. We have said that she was " exceedingly beautiful," but now with her cheeks flushed by the excitement of the occasion, contrasting with her snow-white skin, with her clear, bright eyes (those true indices of perfect health ), flashing with unusual luster from beneath their long, dark lashes, with her heaving bosom expanded far beyond her small tapering waist, she appeared if pos- sible more lovely than ever before.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     319 Never did clergyman join the hands of two whose hearts were more fondly united, and as William proud- ly led her from the altar as his own, many were the whispers that reached his ears, u' Is she not beautiful!" " 6 Does she not look truly angelic!"' "Is he not a noble looking man?" "Are they not a fine couple?" The carriages rolled away from the church and vil- lage, conveying their light hearts back to the cottage. Here the bridal breakfast awaited them, and after par- taking of it, and receiving the congratulations of friends, the bride changed her light apparel for a substantial traveling dress, and the newly married couple left the cottage, and started upon their bridal tour, which was to extend to the continent. They proceeded on the grand route for London, where they arrived in safety, and took a suit of rooms at one of the first hotels. Once- when he was in a deep reverie, his affectionate wife watched the expression of his eyes, and entwining her arms around his neck, asked him in kind and feel- ing words, if aught troubled him. "No, dear, I was only -thinking that if my parents could have the opportunity of but once seeing you, they would forgive all." "Oh, William! with all the devotion, which amounts to idolatry, I have for you, it cannot compensate for the great sacrifice youghave made for me;"7 and bending over him, weeping, her flowing curls fell upon his face. "Talk not thus, dearest Kate,' said he earnestly, 'never say again that I have made a sacrifice, but ra- ther that I am unworthy of such a lovely woman as yourself." "My happiness, dear husband, is more than I could have expected. When I look back upon our very   320    '  LIEUTENANT COLBORN, eventful career of love, and think of the vicissitudes through which we have. passed, think how great have been the obstacles to our union, and how much has been done to annoy us, I am unable to express my thanks-for my present happiness." "I am also truly thankfill," rejoined her husband, "for our present happiness, but darling, promise never again to mention sacrifice to me." And thus they conversed; passing their honeymoon in happiness such as none but true lovers ever experi- ence. Mr. Colborn and his bride entered a private box at the Italian opera, upon the occasion of the appearance of a celebrated star. She, at the request of her doating husband, had decorated herself in a complete set of diamonds, and as her French dressing-mnaid clasped the bracelets on her wrists, she declared that they were the most elegant brilliants she had ever seen. Slight blushes suffused the pretty features of the youthful bride upon finding herself the object of admi- ration by many in different parts of the theater; an ad- miration which in frequent cases found expression in words loud enough for her to hear. General Colborn and wife, with'Melissa, occupied a box opposite, and turning their opera glasses upon the object of general attraction, to their great astonishment discovered by her side their disinherited son! "Who can she b6e" asked Melissa, as Kate's dia- monds flashed back the rays of the numerous lights in that vast apartment, a&dazztle thbir-hriliiay. "I can not imagine," replied her mother, putting her powerful opera glass to her eyes, " but she is very beau- tiful, and has upon her person more brilliants than a e ,   OR THE DISINHERIT ED.     321 princess displays on a reception-day. She must be of. some family that possesses the wealth of Croesus. We must ascertain who she is, and seek her acquaint- ance." "But I can not understand," said Melissa, "why our William should be her escort." "I can not say," observed her mother, "but she is really queen-like. Oh, how I wish William had se- lected a lady like her, instead of the low and poverty- stricken one he did." "Mr. North," whispered Melissa, ' do you see my brother?" "I do not. Is he here?"  "He is! In that rich lady's box there, and, we wish to know who she is." North looked a second time at the lady through his glass, and could scarcely believe his eyes. "I am as- tounded," said he, in a low voice. a Can it be possible! And yet it is so! That lady is .the Inn-keeper's daugh- ter " Mrs. Cblborn turned ghastly pale. at this announce- ment, while Melissa looked again and again through her glass, and the general turned uneasily from side to side on his seat. : "I was sure," said the arrogant mother, " that Will- iam would never have selected her, had she not been far superior to the generality of her class; for notwith- standing his singular principles, he always had a taste of exquisite refinement." "He has certainly selected a very beautiful lady," said the general, ,a and I must say, judging from her ap- 15 a .   322      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, pearance, she is far superior to either Arabeila or El- len." ' Mother! may I not go around with Mr. North, and see her and brother William?" "No, daughter! for it would not do under existing circumstances; it would be an acknowledgment of our approval of his selection, after all." Mr. Colborn did not choose to inform his bride how near they were to his parents and sister, fearing it would cloud her brow now wreathed with happiness,. andSat the close of the performance, he led her to his carriage, and departed as if he had not observed their presence. The newly wedded pair soon departed for Holland, and made arrangements to remain some time at the Hague, and thence intended to proceed up the beautiful Rhine. Colborn had selected this part of Europe in which to spend a portion of the season, owing in part to the fact, that the principles supported here were con- genial with his own, for the old provinces of the Netherlands were still under a republican form of government, which had been adopted in 1795, in imi- tation of the late French government under the Direc- tory. It was at this time that the wonderful military abili- ties of the modern Coesar had developed themselves as surrounded by his talented seconds, Ney, Mireau, Mes- sina, Launes, Soult, Berthier, Davoust, St. Cyr, Vic- tor, Murat, McDonald, Kleber,- Disain, Jordan, An- gereau, and other great leaders of his republican col- umns, he fletw from city to city, and country to cou-n   OR TES DISINHERITED.     8 23 try, hurling ruin into, and dispersing the columns of royalty. It was at this time,/that tyrants, nobles, and aristo- crats, those props of monarchical governments, trembled, for the people had the advaftage. The marching and counter-marching of republican armies from one part of long-enslaved Europe to an- other, spreading the principles of liberty and justice, proclaimed that from the people should emanate power, that monarchs are but men. It was at this time that Napoleon, that prodigy of talent, directed his genius and mighty influence for the good of the masses of mankind, and undermined the unjust tyranny of kings and their oppressive laws, that for centuries had been continually trampling upon the rights of the people. It was at this time that he caused a free worship of God, and protected that unfortunate class that for centuries had been driven from place to place, and without a-country, the persecuted Jews. It was at this time the great conqueror was the people's friend, for self-aggrandizement had not yet caused him to betray them, and his name, like those of Washington and Kosciusko, remained unsullied,-as yet he had not forgotten himself, as yet he had not fallen from his high position of the protector and friend of mankind, to a monarch. Of course a man of William Colborn's political views could scarcely avoid feeling very much interested in the great struggle thus going on between right and wrong, freedom and slavery, republicanism and monarchy. Carried away with enthusiasm, he would indeed have joined the republican armies at once, but was checked at the thought that the cause to be espoused was against   324      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, England, and much as he had become disgusted with her government, he would not appear in arms against his country. Actuated by these feelings, he remained neutral, yet continued to reside in the revolutionary parts, where for the present we will leave him with his lovely bride happy with her, as she with him.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      325 CHAPTER XXXVII. THE UNFORTUNATE STEP. It had been very gay of late at Mount Prospect. Melissa's marriage had been celebrated with great eclat, and followed by a series of grand balls and other enter- tainments, and amidst so much brilliant company the absent was forgotten, for the Colborns still seemed to think more of rank and high connections than of the disinherited son. Sir James Lester, as I have before stated, was an in- timate friend of Sir William, and their families were also on very intimate terms. It was but two days after one of these grand entertainments at Mount Prospect, that the carriage of Sir James drove up to the mansion, and its owner descended therefrom with a greater de- gree of alertness than usual. It was singular that he should call so soon after. He was received by Sir William with cordiality, and led into the presence of the ladies. After the usual civilities and, a short conversation, be begged of Mrs. Colborn and Mrs. North to excuse him, as he-wished to speak of business matters in private with Sir William. The gentlemen arose to leave the room, and Mrs. Col- born smiled and remarked, "Politics, I know,' and they made their way to the study and took seats. After a few preliminary remarks, Sir James ran his fingers   326      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, through his hair, and with an aherm, said that he had been informed by his steward, that his finances were in rather an embarrassing condition just now, which placed him in an awkward position. "I can sympathize with you," said Sir William; " the panic caused by this war has almost stagnated trade, confidence appears to waver, and all suffer from the stringency of the money market more or less." "It is too true, my dear Sir William, too true, for upon inquiry, I find that I can not realize on my real estate, unless I have the name of a man of known wealth and honor like yourself upon my paper." Sir William knew little about business, and as his friend was well known to be one of the most wealthy men in the vicinity, being possessed of two large estates, besides landed property in Ireland by right of his wife, he did not consider it necessary to consult his agent upon the subject. 6 Of course," said he, "I am always ready to oblige my old tried friend, and therefore my dear Sir James, just l6t your steward draw up the paper, and I will give it my signature." Sir James thanked him, highly pleased that his re- quest had not been denied, and changed thb subject to politics, his favorite topic, and after an hour's conversa- tion, he, aroge, and having bade the ladies adieu, de- parted much happier than he came. "Now," thought he, "I shall be free from the per- plexing position I have unfortunately been in ever since the commencement of this money crisis." Upon his arrival home, he instructed his steward to draw up the necessary document- (specifying a large   OR THE DISINHERITED.     327 amount), and take the same to Sir William Colborn for his signature. The steward looked --surprised, but said nothing. Having drawn up the document in due form, he entered a carriage, and directed the coachman to Mount Prospect. "Is it possible," said he to himself, 1' that Sir William can be so perfectly blind as to sign this paper? can it be possible that he does not know that he will thus be- come security for the large sum on its face'? And should Sir James's property be attached, and he become insolvent - egad! and I am of opinion that such will soon be the case -that the endorser may be looked to for payment;--but it is no affair of mine, they ar- ranged the business themselves, and Sir James is my employer, and not Sir William.'" He arrived at the mansion, was waited upon into the library, and presently the general appeared, "presume," said the general, " that you require my signature to some document?" "Sir James has sent me here for that purpose, sir." "Let me see it." The steward took it from his pocket, and presented it. Sir William looked it over, placed it before him on the table, reached for a pen, and saying, 1' it is a very large amount, but I suppose it is all right," signed the fatal instrument. The steward sprinkled some sand over the signature, folded it up, placed it carefully in his pocket, and bid- ding Sir William good day, departed. As the carriage drove down the passage, he looked on either side at the wealthy estate, and concluded that the time would soon come when it would become the property of another.   328      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, He alone knew to what an extent Sir James's prop- erty was involved, and although the paper he held would assist in averting the coming blow for the pres- ent, unless there should take place some miraculous change in monetary affairs, ruin to both parties must come in the end!   OR THE DISINHERITEDo     329 CHAPTER      XXXVIII. THE WILLo As the bright and glorious day cannot last, but must be followed by night, as serene and warm summer must be succeeded by the cold blasts of winter, so must life blessed by comforts and happiness be followed by the shado'w of death. The winter had set in unusually severe, and spread over the cottage and the country about the village of Esk, his snowy sheets, and the gusts of the northwest wind broke against the cottage at times with fearful power. Mr. Pederson had unfortunately taken a very severe cold, which settled into a pleurisy, that confined him to his bed. The family physician was called, and used his best endeavors to master the disease, but medicines, blisters, the lancet, and all the remedies that science could sug- gest, were used in vain. The old gentleman suffered much for many days, his system had become so reduced that the powerful remedies that at first had been re- sorted to could no longer be used. Another physician was called, and after a deliberate consultation, they declared that there was no longer any hope of his re- covery. Mr. Pederson, when informed of the decision, calmly - I58 *   330      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, said he was prepared to go; but earnestly desired that his daughter should be informed of his illness as early as possible, that he might see her once more ere he should go hence forever. But the request could not bring her in time, as she was still on the continent. He gradually sank, and upon the fourth day after the consultation of the physicians, was no more! Poor Rose stood weeping by his bedside, and even while his eyes were fixed upon her, he ceased to breathe! The good man had passed through this world of trouble, and his soul had no doubt reached a better. The packets running between London and Rotter- dam were frequently several weeks in making a trip in the winter season, And it was not till nearly four weeks after the demise of Mr. Pederson that his daughter reached the cottage. She did not have the opportu- nity of following the remains of her father to the grave, she. had not been near him to cheer him in his last hours, and hence she felt his loss the more bitterly. But although her orphan heart was pierced with grief, there still remained to her a protector, a consoler, on whom she might rely at all tirnes, in the person of her husband. The will of the deceased made James Green, Esq., of Plymouth, his sole executor, and this gentleman at once proceeded to make the necessary arrangements required by law and custom relative to the property. By the returns of the appraisers it was shown that, exclusive of the fortune discovered in the tree, the property of the deceased amounted to a sum far exceeding the expecta- tions of any of his friends. By economical habits, a careful attention to business for more than forty years, and interest accumulating upon interest in judicious in-   OR THE DISINHERITED,     331 vestments, he had acquired nearly thirty thousand pounds. Then, the value of the diamonds etc. discov- ered in the tree was found to be much greater than had ever been anticipated, for, after deducting all expenses, it amounted to more than two hundred and thirty thou- sand pounds. Here was a fortune! Two hundred and sixty thousand pounds! What a wealthy heiress iour heroine had become! How just had been the reward in this instance of the virtuous and the good. By the will of the deceased, nearly all of this immense fortune fell to Kate. The will ran as follows: I, George Pederson, of Plymouth, Devonshire Coun- ty, England, being in good health and sound mind- thank God - do declare this to be my last will and tes- tament. I bequeath to my son Henry Pederson my watch, gun, and books. I give to my son George Pederson, junior (who was adopted by Mrs. Sarah Brady when an infant, and has taken the name of Brady), my honest name, and may he never forsake or disgrace it.' To my only daughter Catherine Pederson, I bequeath my furniture, bedding, etc., and the portraits of her parents. I bequeath to Mrs. Sarah Brady, widow of the friend of my youth, John Brady, of London, the sum of four hundred pounds sterling, to be taken from any portion of my property that my executor may think best, and to be paid as early as possible after my demise. I give to my faithfiul servant Rose, four hundred pounds sterling, and recommend her to the care of my daughter.   832      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, I will to the Poor-House Asylum at Plymouth, to be used directly for the benefit of the destitute, the sum of one hundred pounds. The balance of all my property, both real and per- sonal, that I now or may hereafter possess, I bequeath to my, surviving children, to be equally divided amongst them. I appoint my old friend James Green, Esq., of Ply- mouth, my sole executor in case of my demise before either of my children becomes of age, or in case of there being no surviving issue; but in case there is one or more children, of age, known to be living, and resident in England, that oldest child shall be the executor or executrix as the case may be. As compensation for all trouble, time, and expense that may be caused to my executor or executrix, I wish him or he. to be remunerated from my property, irre- spective of family or friendly feeling. I revoke all form- er wills, and declare this only to be my last will and testament.

Ot THE DISINHERITED.     333 CHAPTER XXXIX. THE FALL. When Sir William Colborn's agent heard that his- employer had become security for Sir James Lester for a heavy amount, he could hardly credit it, as it was the practice of Sir William to consult him upon all im- portant business matters. But as the report had come from good authority, he feared it mEight be true. I hope it is not true," said he to himself, as he paced the floor of his office, u' but yet he may have been taken in by Sir James's sharp steward. He should have con- sulted me upon such an important affair--affairs of which he knows nothing about. It becomes my duty to see him at once. I'll ride over to Mount Prospect, although I declare it is a disagreeable subject to intro- duce, as Sir William is quite singular upon such mat- ters. However, I must get this anxiety off my mind, even if 1 do offend him." He drove to Mount Prospect, and as he entered he met the general ins the hall. "How do you do?" said Sir William, extending his hand. "Glad to see you! walk in! have not seen you for some time." "I regret the fact very much," said the agent, as he threw off his overcoat, and entered the warm library. "Why so?"   334      LIEUTENANT COLBORN) The agent shrugged his shoulders. "Why so?" repeated the general, eyeing him with a look that savored of commingled anxiety and curi- osity. "I have reasons, sir," he answered, " but fear to of- fend if I state thbm." "What are your reasons? I know you would not interfere impertinently with my affairs - speak out." "Well, sir, I have been informed that you have taken a step that you may hereafter regret." "How so? What step? Speak out, man I What do you mean?" "I am told that Sir James Lester has your name upon his paper as security for a large amount." "Well, and what of that?" said the general sharply. "Do you think I can not use my judgment in a business transaction without consulting you?" " I hope Sir William does not think for a moment that I came here to intrude upon his privacy, or to act in any way in opposition to his wishes," and the agent made a motion as if about to go. "I think you mean well towards me, at least," said Sir William, " but what about Sir James's paper?" "Well, sir, that is just what I have come to ascertain. I, feeling. an interest in your welfare, am anxious to know if the report I have heard that you have become Sir James's security for a large amount is true?" "I have done so." The agent looked regretful. "But why," continued the general, "should you dis- approve of the act when you know that Sir James is so wealthy?"  The sharp man of business looked him full in the face,   OR THE DISINEIERITED.     335 and very nleaningly and calmly answered, " he is re- ported to be very wealthy." "Then do you not think he is so?" "I am sorry to say I do not, sir." "Oh! I have no fears, no fears about it," exclaimed Sir William, bracing himself up, and striding hastily to and -fro. i' I hope, for your sake, there is no cause for fear," said the agent, and-after some further conversation of a sim- ilar tenor, he departed. In the course of a few weeks there were circumstances that gave reasons to suppose that the agent's surmises were about to be realizdd, for Sir James Lester was re- ported to be insolvent, and, in short, on the first of Jan- uarv affairs at Mount Prospect became sadly changed. Sir James's creditors not being 'able to save themselves on his property, had couime, upoll his bondsman, and Sir William's property was attiachlcd to make their claims good; and the general so lately wealthy was reduced to poverty. The elegant mansion, the fine estates, were all taken from him, even his half pay as a general in the army was claimed by his creditors, and himself and lady were dependent upon the generosity of their friends to maintain them. Sir William took these sad misfortunes very much to heart as might have been expected, and the grief of his haughty lady knew no bounds. Indeed, so terrible was the calamity to her that at one time she was not ex- pected to survive it. However, there appeared to be no alternative, and preparations were made for leaving Miount Prospect and removing to the West End to re- side with their daughter, Mrs. North. It was a sorrowful day for them when at length they   336       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, entered- their son-in-law's carriage, and left the proud mansion that had been so long in the family! Of course many censured Sir William for signing the fatal paper without first consulting his agent, who would have warned him of his error, and thus have averted . his ruin; while much blame was given to Sir James and his steward for taking advantage of Sir William's friendly generosity, and while many pitied the Colborns- for their great fall, others said it served them right for their unfeeling and unnatural treatment of their only son. fMelissa endeavored to console her parents in their adversity, but in vain. How could they meet the proud families they had so often met, and so often entertained as guests at their mansion? The general's pride being thus stricken, he refused to appear in society, but inourned in solitude, while his lady grieved, if possible, still worse, and took to her bed.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      337 CHAPTER XL. THE 'RECONCILIATION, When the news recounted in the previous chapter reached the cottage, William Colborn and his lady were as much grieved as they were astonished, and although he had certainly been treated in a most cruel man- ner by his parents, yet as he read the advertisement of Mount Prospect for sale by auction, and realized what a severe blow it must be to his proud parents, his heart melted, and he walked to a window as if to look out, to conceal from his wife the tears that, in spite of his man- ly exertions, started from his eyes. He continued standing at the window in deep con- templation when the hand of his wife was laid softly on his shoulder. She entwined her arms fondly about him, and feelingly said, "Do not mourn, my dear William, for your parents' misfortune, for it might have been even worse." "I do not mourn for the loss of the mere property," said he, "but I grieve to think of the harrowing feel- ings my parents must have to contend with in halving our old homestead go from the possession of the Col- born family." "If that is all," said Kate, "it can easily be remedied: you can purchase it with a portion of the wealth my dear father left us." .T   338       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, He pressed her still closer to his bosom, and exclaimed, "Dear Kate! noblest of your sex! how can you so readily forgive my parents, who have so slighted you?" "I never yet have censured your parents for refus- ing to receive me into their family - it is quite natural for the rich to ignore the poor - but I have thought and X still do think that their treatment to you, their son, has been unnatural." "And yet," continued her husband, "you would have me forgive them even after having treated me so un-, kindly." "Most certainly," she answered, " for they. are your parents. Oh I William, cherish your parents while you have them. I, alas! have none. My dear father has been taken from me, and had I not my dear husband to lean upon, how friendless I should be!" and as she spoke, she burst into tears. "My poor mother,"' con- tinued she " was called hence when I was quite young, but yet I can remember well her many acts of kindness to me, and although years have passed since I was de- prived of her fostering care, I often look back with feelings of deep thankfulness for her gentle teachings." "My dear Kate, I know not how to express my es- teem for such noble sentiments." a"Go, my love," said his wife, " go to London imme- diately, and no matter what it costs, preserve Mount Prospect to your family." In the meantime a dialogue was going on in the ditchen between Martin and Rose. "What's the matter?" asked Martin, as he noticed a change in her appearance. "More trouble." "What trouble?  What's out now?"   OR TIHE DISINHERITED.   339 '( Sir, William C6lborn has lost his property." "What do you say? All of it?" "All." "Whew!-how did he lose it?" "I don't know, but I have heard that the estate is to be sold at auction." "Did you hear them say so?" , Yes, and they are taking on about it." "Why should they take on so? They have plenty of money." "Yes," said Rose with a smile, "3 r. Pederson left his daughter very wealthy." i"I know he did." ,Rose placed her hand on his shoulder, and looked him in the face affectionately, but {Martin as usual ap- peared quite indifferent to her advances, and did not seem to take the intended hint that she was partial to him. Rose turned away and said to herself, "I wonder if all men are as stupid as he seems to be! I have been for a long time trying to make him know that I wish him to love me, but he does not or will not take my meaning. I do not wish to be so bold as to ask him outright, but let me see - I fave it now. I know of a plan to make him take a hint. Yes," she continued, "master left his daughter a very large fortune, and I am also named in his will." u' What do you say?" exclaimed Martin in astonish- ment. "Did he will you anything?" ' Indeed he did." "Are you in earnest, Rose?" "Of course I am.'9 "' How much-did he will you?"   340      LIEUTENANT"COLBORN, "What would you give to know?" "Oh! nonsense! you are joking, Rose." "I tell you I am not." "How much then?" "Four hundred!" Martin's eye brightened, and he chucked her under the chin. "Ah! ha!" said Rose to herself, " you begin to wake up, do you?" "Four hundred pounds?" he repeated. "Certainly." "Oh! my dear," said Martin, " that's a great deal of money, indeed it is." "Ha! ha! ha!" cried Pose, ' you dear me now, but never did before." "Nonsense!" said Martin, taking her hand in his, "dont lbe foolish, Rose. I was always partial to you. But how do you know that you are mentioned in the will?" "Mistress has told me so." "And when can you have the money?" "At any time." - "Rose! I have loved you for a good while, but see' ing no way to get along with a wifer have not liked to tell you so." "You don't love me, Martin, you love the four hun- dred pounds!" and she receded from him. "I tell you it is you I love!" and he followed her, and putting his arm around her, kissed her. "You never tried to kiss me before! You never would kiss me, you stupid fellow!" "Dear Rose! give up this nonsense, and tell me when we are to be made happy."   OR THE DISINHERITED.     341 Ha! ha! ha I Are we not happy now?" "Don't tease me, Rose! You know what I mean?" "No! I can't taike hints! What do you mean?" ' To get married." "I will not take the hint.': "Dear Rose! will you hot have me?" "Ask the four hundred pounds." "Rose! dear Rose! don't tease me so. Will you not accept of me for a husband?" "' They are to start for London to-morrow," said Rose, "and you are to go with them." ' And will you not ask to be taken too, dear Rose? But here comes Mrs. Colborn, and I must be off," and he bounded out of the far kitchen door. The following day preparations were made for the departure. Rose's request had been granted, and Mr. Colborn and lady, with their servants, journeyed to London, and took the rooms which they formerly occu- pied at the hotel. At the given time for the auction, Colborn rode to Mount Prospect. There were gathered about the grounds a number of wealthy gentlemen who were bus- ily engaged inspecting the estate, while others were at the stables, passing their opinions upon the value of the horses and carriages. Others were in the mansion, looking at carpets, paintings, furniture, etc. Colborn walked upon the lawn in front of the house, waiting for the time set for the auction to open. He did not inspect an article belonging to the estate, as it mat- tered not to him what was the value of the same; he had appeared there to purchase it at any price. He had upon his person the necessary amount in bank notes, and had the creditors known of his determination, they   342       LIEUTENANT COLBORN, would have made him pay dearly for Mount Prospect. -He became somewhat irritated on seeing so many men roughly pushing through those doors that had long been guarded by his father's servants, but when he thought that he should soon place his parents again in -posses- sion, he became more tranquil. Precisely at twelve o'clock the auctioneer mounted the steps in front of the mansion, and after a long har- angue about the splendor of this and the durability of that, called for a bid. The auction proceeded, and finally the entire estate,'including all of its appurtenances, was knocked down to William Colborn; junior. Hav- ing given checks upon the bank of England for the amount, he received the deeds and bills of sale, and re- turned to the hotel. The members of the Colborn family shed tears of joy when, on the following day, the purchase of Mount Pros- pect by the disinherited son was announced. "Oh! I am so happy," cried the old lady, " to think that our dear Mount Prospect is still to be retained in our family.5" "XMy noble boy! my generous son!" exclaimed the general, " he has saved us from ruin and poverty." "And me from the grave," joined his lady. "Foool! fool that I was," cried the general, "to have disinherited him. How can I ever meet him?" But this colloquy was interrupted by the announce- ment that the carriage of Mr. Colborn, Jr., was at the gate. Sir William hurried down, and having drawn his son from the carriage, cordially grasped his hand, and pressed him to enter the house. He was led into the presence of his mother and sister. They embraced him affectiongtely, while, North grasped his hand, and addressed him as " shipmate."   OR THE DISINHERITED.     843 "Father!" said William, "here are the documents that reinstate you in your former position,"' and he took from his pocket a small packet enclosed with an envel- ope, and presented it. "My noble son, I thahk you; but as that property will be yours in a few years, I prefer that you hold the papers," and he handed them back to his son. "Then, dear sir, since I can not prevail on you to accept of them, let me beg of you to spend the remain- der of your days at the homestead of our fathers." J' I will gladly accept of your kind invitation, and may God bless you!" said the general in a faltering voice. "' And since Melissa is no longer to be with us, I beg that you, my dear William, and your excellent lady, will occupy our former plachs, for without you we should be6 indeed lonely.", "Oh! by all means," urged William's mother, " we could not do without your worthy wife." "They have indeed changed," thought he, "for it is no longer - the low girl - the low creature -you are throwing yourself away; no longer-go from us- you are disinherited. But your excellent wife must come and live with us - we could not do without your worthy wife--you are my noble son, etc. However, they are my parents, and I must overlook it."' ' Is your wife in London?" asked Mrs. North. "She is."  ' We must call on her at' the earliest opportunity. Where are you residing?" "At the S --n hotel.)" "Oh, indeed!" said Mrs. Colborn, "I shall be most happy to meet my daughter-in-law." "And so shall I," said the general, "let us go at onceo '   344      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, "Gold is indeed powerful," ;thought William, " and the old saying true, 'that money malkes the mare go,' but I forgive them." Mrs. William Colborn rose to receive them as her husband ushered them in at the S -n hotel. She was dressed in plain black, but looked modest and lovely, as she would have ,looked in any dress. She received the parents and sister of her husband with the kindest politeness, -and as if she had never been slighted, re- turned their warm greetings with equal cordiality. Mrs. North soon became highly pleased with her, and em- braced her with a clear conscience, for she had never taken any part in her brother's disinheriting. Her parents, however, must have been ashamed of their former cruel conduct towards their son, and for all they had said against his wife, and must have been annoyed with feelings of remorse, when they embraced her. They, however, showed in their manners that they re- gretted having acted so rigidly with their son, and hav- ing made apologies which William and Kate begged they would not mention, the scene ended in a perfect reeonciliation.   OR TItE DISINHERITED,     345 GHAPTER XLIo THE CONCLUSION. Mount Prospect was again occupied by Sir William Colborn and his family. William and Kate had been prevailed upon to reside at their mansion, but they were much of the time absent, as they were pleased to remain for weeks at a time at the cottage, and sometimes to travel on the continent. The same gay style of living was again assumed at the mansion, and the same friends mingled in the mazy dance, and sat at the choice board of Sir William Col. born, as formerly. It was soon known that the younger Mrs. Colborn was a very rich heiress, and that she had redeemed the estate by purchase, and was not only very beautiful in person, but pleasant, witty, and intelligent. She was very much respected, and her society coveted by the first people among all Sir William's widely circulated ac- quaintance. Indeed, she was one of the most accomplished ladies in that circle. Her long stay at the Hague, and other places on the continent had given her the advantage of the society of Queen Hortense, Madame de Stael, and other talented ladies, and her bright gifts by nature had become very much improved. The excellent and beautiful Arabella still figured con. 16   OSU      LU'tJ.'.LEUANAL' C'OLJN. LJ? spicuously at these festivals, and became intimate with the younger Mrs. Colborn. But she did not retain the name of Surrey long after William's marriage, and as he conversed with her, and called to mind her honor, virtue, and purity, and as he looked at her noble hus- band, he thought that he, like himself, had been fortun. ate, for he knew that his wife, like his own, was a prize. He never met Ellen again, but when in conversation the family of Sir James happened to be spoken of, a thought would flash across his memory of the bold dash she had made to entrap him for a husband, and he concluded that he who was so unfortunate as to take her hand, must do as all men should with a coquette, watch her! Mrs. Brady continued a friend of the family, and al- ways spoke of her old departed friend Mr. Pederson in terms of the highest esteem. Martin married Rose, who often joked him on the idea that four hundred pounds had more power over him than she herself had. They lived at the cottage, and kept it and its grounds neat and tasty for the reception of their masteir and mistress. Harry and Toono still continued to be happy at their island home, as is shown by the following letter, the contents of which gave Mr. and Mrs. Colborn no little, astonishment.   OR THE DISINHERITED.     347 OTAnIE ITE, DEC., 18-. MR. GE'ORGE PEDERSON, Plymouth, England, DEAR FATHER:--I have written o you a number of times within the last eight years, stating my adventures and how I have been living in this beautiful island, but as I have never received an answer, nor in any way heard from you, I- presume   you have not received my missives. I will therefore pen the same old story again, and perhaps this may reach you. I left England as a sailor-boy in the la'st month of 1787, on board of the ship Bounty, Captain Bligh. The ship was sent by the government for the purpose of procuring bread-fruit plants, and after a very long and tedious voyage, we arrived at these islands.- Having procured about a thousand plants, so far accomplishing the object of our voyage, the ship sailed for home. The mutiny of which you doubtless are informed, took place in April, 1789. Mr. Christian was the leading mutineer, and after they had taken the ship, he ordered me to re- main with him, and I, being only a youngster, was obliged to do as he, the leader of the strongest party, wished. They ordered the captain and others into a boat, and sailed back to the island with the ship. After our ar- rival at Otaheite, we all took wives of the native women, many of whom are very pretty. I was married by the laws of this island, which are no doubt just as sacred was those of civilized countries. The name of my wife is Toono, and although her seventh little one now  creeps upon the matted floor of our cabin, she is not yet twenty-seven.  She is the daughter of a chief, is a superior person, and --although   348      LIEUTENANT COLBORN, I say it - she is a most beautiful woman. With her I have been one of the happiest of men, excepting for a short period during the presence of the frigate Race- Horse. She cruised among these islands for about six months, during which time her crow harassed us, until my comradeswere all killed or taken. I escaped many times most miraculously by the assistance of my faithful Toono. My last escape was accomplished by leaping into the sea and diving under a hollow rock, just as the boat's crew in pursuit fired on us. We remained beneath the rock in horrible suspense throughout the day, as we heard the officer of the boat say that the frigate's guns would destroy the rock. After dark we dived out, and -after swimming silently to the shore, concealed our- selves in the forest. Next day the frigate broadsided 'the rock, and blew it to atoms. The first lieutenant, I must say, behaved very kindly to me and also to my Toono. The frigate soon after sailed from the island, leaving me to safety and love. I have ever enjoyed since that time as perfect happiness as can be bestowed upon man in this life. It is true that I should like to see my old father and sister, but yet as I am more nearly connected here, I am certain I shall never see you again. In fact, I have been so long amongst these natives that I should be unhappy elsewhere. May you be blessed with a long life of comfort in this ' world, and meet with a re- ception into that heaven we .have been taught to be- lieve exists in the next. I remain your affectionate son, HARRY PEDEIRSON.   OR THE DISINHERITED.      349 William Colborn informed his wife what he had seen at those islands, how Toono had been a prisoner on board the ship, and afterwards Harry, and how he had taken a most singular liking to him, and wished him free. As he was going on with the narrative, he observed the tears moisten the cheeks of Kate, as she thought of the unfortunate fate that seemed to have been marked out for her brothers; but he soon caused her to banish such feelings from her mind, and neither of her brothers were ever heard of afterwards. Our hero and heroine lived for years in happiness, being blessed with hiany children, who, imbibing from both parents far different ideas than the government of their own country granted, became dissatisfied, and emi- grated to the New World. They there united them- selves with their prolific Anglo-Saxon cousins, and from them sprang into existence an hundred beings who to this day proudly adhere to the principles of republi- canism.
