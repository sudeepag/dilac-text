CHAPTER I. High life-The disclosure-Unkind temper-Ambitious projects-Leaving home-The Quaker companion. I HAD noticed, for some time previous to the departure of my father, on his last European tour, that he was becoming unusually thoughtful, and looked on me with a sadness of countenance that would have touched any heart but mine. But instead of seeking out the cause of his sorrow, and endeavoring to alleviate it, I gave myself itp to the pursuit of pleasures, in which he had no share: and I felt that he was acting with great unkindness, in letting his cares-whether of a pecuniary nature, or of unavailing repinings, in consequence of my preference for associates more congenial than himself-so to affect his spirits as to render his presence, if not quite an annoyance, at least a serious check upon my ungovernable vi- vacity. Born in the lap of indulgengce, and nurtured in luxury, I be- came possessed of the most extravagant desires; and had no hes- itation in exacting the, sacrifice of the wishes of all others to my own capricious whims. I contributed, with sportive waste, to the vast expenses of my father's household,-an establishment kept up in a style of unusual magnificence for my gratification alone. It never occurred to me, that I had a duty to perform in the man- agement of our domestic affairs. Interest I affected to despise, and 1'   10        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, economy was a vulgar term, unsuited to the vocabulary of my high-bred pretensions. The routine of my pleasures had been uninterrupted during the year of my father's absence, and his affectionate letters remained unanswered, for the reason that they were seasoned with a slight tincture of admonition, which was entirely uncongenial to my taste, and to my notions of female independence. Meantime, my ex- pensive habits were on the increase, while he, on his return, seemed inclined to become parsimonious. One morning, after a breakfast, silent on his part, as we arose from the table, he informed me that he wished to have some con- versation with me in the library. His manner was unusually grave, and so entirely discordant with my merry humor, that noth- ing but the need of supplies could have induced me to assent with- out demurring,-without asking him to put himself in a better humor. Having a great requirement in reserve for his purse on that day, I concealed my displeasure, and followed him with evely appearance of alacrity, chatting as I went, on the beauties of the morning, and of the delightful associates with whom I was about to make an excursion to a fashionable watering-place. On entering the library, he closed the door, and after desiring me to be seated, he paced the floor in a manner so nervous, so sig- nificant of the throes of bad tidings, that I began to fear for the result of my calculations on his immediate resources,-indeed, to fear that he had met with some serious reverse of fortune; and, as if by some electric movement, disappointment, mortification, and all the missiles of wounded pride flitted before my imagination;-ri- vals scorning! lovers flying! dependants mocking! The moment had not the dulness of suspense, but the keenness of reality. At last, when my father seated himself beside me, and took my hand kindly, I recoiled as from an enemy, about to rob me of all that made life desirable. It seems strange to me, now, that not one feeling of tenderness moved my heart towards him, my only, my ever-indulgent parent, when I believed him to be overwhelmed by some latent misfortune. But I own, with deep aversion to the character, that I had become a vain coquette, and regarded man- kind, only, as ministers to my pleasure. My father, who had nev- er interposed his parental authority over my expenditures, I looked upon more as y banke, than my guardian. But myheart is filled with gratitude, when I reflect that Nature did not make me an un- kind, ungrateful creature, and that it was but the work of an erro-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       " neous education, followed up by a course of life inconsistent with the true design of our creation; and amended while the soul was yet capable of nourishing the sweet charities of life. My father appeared, at once, to divine the cause of my cold- ness; and after some almost incoherent reflections on his indul- gence and mistaken appreciation of my character, proceeded to in- form me that our prospects were clouded by misfortune,-that we might account ourselves as beggars;--that his funds, which were invested in a foreign House, were supposed to be lost, and that his home property was under liabilities. "' Then, let us die," said I, "by our own hands." 'Are you prepared to die?" he inquired, seriously. "Better prepared to die, than to live--an object of scorn!" He mildly answered, "The virtuous poor are not scorned by the wise; and the opinions of the foolish would be a bad argu- ment in favor of suicide. We must be content to occupy an hum- bler place in society; but I have still hopes of again being in pos- session of a competence." "Com-pe-tence," I repeated, disdainfully; and sighed, as I re- collected the many lost opportunities of establishing myself in af- fluence,-and a slight reflection crossed my mind, that these oppor- tunities were becoming less frequent. Yet the idea suggested it- self, that a few months longer continuance in society might be pro- ductive of happy results, and give me a claim to something more than competence,-to respectability. I therefore begged that our misfortunes might be concealed for the present My father, with less regard to my feelings than he had ever manifested on any former occasion, replied that he imposed on no man; and reminded me that I was then in my twenty-eighth year, "a period of life," said he, " when youthfulness has partially fallen off, and when, as in single women of coquettish habits, without being replaced by that amiability, intelligence, and dignity, ac- quired by the more wise, and which give charms more endearing, more lasting, than the vivacity of extreme youth, the chances of forming a desirable connection are against all who have not the bait of fortune.' "' Widows at thirty," he continued, "  make more successful competitors for the regard of the other sex, than spins- ters of the same age, for the very reason that their coquetries are laid aside at their marriage, and the interval employed in the cultivation of those social traits, which find easy access to the heart. The widow comes out with the confiding simplicity of girl-   12        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, hood: lovers are again new and pleasing to her, while to them, the departure of the rosy tints of youth are more than counter- vailed by the candor; sobriety, and discretion, which secures their confidence, and awakens, in them, the most generous sympathies." Shocked at the mention of my own age, and at the contrast which my father had drawn between me and the "'more wise," I rather demanded than asked, " what was to become of us ? and of whom we should beg ? since he had pronounced us beggars." He seemed prepared for my irritability, and without manifest- ing any displeasure in consequence, replied, that he had made ar- rangement with the maternal grandmother of the children of his deceased brother, to receive me as a member of her family. "You are aware," said he, " that she lives in Salem, near Boston, and that she has charge of your cousins. You will find with them a comfortable home, and you will there have an opportunity of imn- proving your mind by reading, while I design to go and see if a remnant of my fortune cannot be saved." This was, indeed, a sad reverse, a bewildering alternative. ' The family of his deceased brother, consisting of three orphan children' and their maternal grandmother." I knew that we had such connections, and that my father sometimes corresponded with them, and   that he had endeavored to inflict on me the perusal of their letters; and he had, of late, hinted that I might be improved by an acquaintance with them. This I indignantly resented, for they had fallen into that state of mediocrity, from which my father obtained his notions of " compe- tence," and I feared, also, his notions of good morals. But I had never been inclined to put myself under the tutelage of a pseudo morality, neither to bring about me a host of poor and envious re- lations. After some further discussion with my father on the subject of my removal, he informed me that in three days I must bid adieu to Arch-street-to Philadelphia. Terrified as I was, at the an- nouncement, I cried, "Let me go at once, and avoid both condo- lence and sneers." My father continued, " You will travel with a Friend to your place of destination, while I shall remain here long enough to make the necessary arrangements, and then sail imme- diately for England."   ie then left me to my own reflections. After giring orders to the servants to say to those, who might be disposed to call, that I was engaged in packing for a journey to the North, I fled to my chamber. The disclosures of the last few   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      13 hours overwhelmed me with a sort of stupor, or rather, amaze- ment. Thought seemed to be suspended, an incubus sat on my mind, and as I surveyed, from my window, the elegant throng, who parade that fashionable street, they seemed to be at a vast distance, and 'patially hidden by an intervening atmosphere. Thus I sat until a late hour in the afternoon, when I was summoned by my maid to dinner. The message aroused me, and my first proud im- pulse was to assume an air of dignity and composure. I raised my head from my hand, and looped up a curl, which I had for some time been training to stray coquettishy about my neck. As I did this, I noticed a smirk of derision playing on the lip of the menial. After repeating the invitation to dinner, she withdrew. Little as I was disposed to partake of the good cheer which still graced our board, I sat down as usual. The hour passed off with some animation on the part of my father; and for myself, I was enabled to go through this first ordeal before the servants, with tolerable composure. They had, that morning, been informed of our reverse of fortune, and were curious to witness the effect it might have on me. They each and every one found an excuse to be in attendance. The napkins were exchanged by the laundress, under pretence that the wrong ones had been laid. The 'cook came in to apologize for lhaving seasoned the soup too high, although I had just added both salt and cayenne. The coachman came, with an appearance of alarm, to say that " the bright bay would not eat his oats." And they all departed, looking backward, until they were entirely out of sight. Although their impertinent gaze seemed to dive into my very soul, and revel in its miseries, yet I retained my composure, and retired, congratulating myself on having maintained a serene countenance and a proud heart, under this, my first humiliation. I fancied that I had a new insight into my own character, and that I should find my strength equal to the emergency. I resolved to turn my calamity to some great account. I would become a heroine, and distinguish myself. But what en- terprise was open to my ambition? I could think of none. I would turn devotee, and astonish the world by my sanctity. But, then, the privations and mortifications of a whole life would find no reward in the adoration of a few fanatics. Next my fancy suggested, I thought with more reason and certainty of success, the idea of becoming a prodigy of learning. This would be a dis- tinction without alloy, and might be earned, independent of cir- cumstances, and without accountability to others.   1 4        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, In pursuance ofe this freak, I reflected with infinite satisfaction, that in the family of my poor relations I might become ini- tiated into the habit of study, without making my newly-ac- quired devotion to literature a theme for prying curiosity. I imagined that nothing but the will to learn was necessary to fit the mind for study, and that every effort would be crowned with success. Full of this conceit, I, the next day, began to prepare for my journey without reluctance, believing that in the fulness of my desire to be again of importance in society, my immortal career in the fields of learning would shed lustre on the name which now seemed entailed upon me as my only inheritance. I tried to call up something of my studies at school, and bustled about in one of the maid's wrappers, repeating to myself, Ego amo, all the Latin I remembered to have learned. My wardrobe was soon packed and ready for transportation, together with a small guitar, which I retained as an evidence of my attachment to the science of music. With my splendid piano-an instrument on which I did excel-I parted without regret, the willing privation confirming me in the opinion that I was capable of practising any degree of self-de- nial. When I embraced my father for the last time - before my de- parture, the air of. profound satisfaction with which he took leave of me both grieved and annoyed me. I was even vexed that he did not take our separation more at heart. The complacent and accommodating temper of mind, which I bad adopted as immuta- ble, forsook me for the instant, and I left him, reflecting that he should, at least, have accompanied me to my new home, and there endeavor to reconcile me to the companionship of poverty, and to the insulting familiarity of relatives, basely ignorant, as I sup- posed, of the elegancies and refinements to which I had been ac- customed.  By degrees I recovered my equanimity of spirit; reconfirmed myself in my new resolutions, there being no other alternative, and determined to avoid all exhibition of my most popular accom- plishments, and enter into the pastime of my new associates with becoming condescension, comforting my vanity with the assurance that my own innate superiority and refinement would be a suffi- cient guaranty against deterioration from contact with those of less exclusive habits. The, companion of my journey was an elderly Quaker, goipg to   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      15 attend a "Yearly meeting" at Salem. He was kind and atten- tive, and, with true delicacy, made my expenses light, without appearing to think of the depressed state of my finances. Yet hew had been made acquainted with our misfortunes, and appeared to notice the plain suit, in which I thought proper to be attired, with approbation; and on one occasion he said to me, "Friend, thy gar- ments show that thee has good sense." I do not know how it was that this compliment fastened itself so on my mind, but on that simple sentence-- thee has good sense"--I endeavored to lay the foundation of a new character. Seeing me safe in the arms of my friends, my Quaker com- panion bade me an affectionate "Farewell." ,   16        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, CHAPTER II. Reception from poor relations-Beautiful instance of piety-Domestie management- The "tstanding guest'-Welcome from Mr. Lysander--Theory of gardening, etc.- The schoolroom. IN a neat and rather commodious cottage in the suburb of Salem, I was received by my new companions with a tender welcome. The family of the late Richard Burleigh consisted of two daugh- ters and a son, who were living with their grandmother, Mrs. Carlisle, to whom the cottage belonged. My first impression,. on my introduction to this family was, that in keeping myself aloof from them, the loss had been entirely my own. I at once felt how in my own forward and fitful manner compared with their re- spectful courtesy and quiet self-possession. Mrs. Carlisle received me as the child of some dear friend, with a civility in which there was much of endearment. My cousin Sarah called me the " new nestling," in so sweet and so soothing a tone, that I melted into tears, which Amy, the younger, perceiving, she endeavored to cheer me, calling me by my Christian name--Helen. "I have always," said she, "associated embroidery and other beautiful ac- complishments with that name." "Helen Burleigh is a name that I shall love," said Willie, a lovely lad of little more than ten years, " and she shall be my own dear pretty tuzzen." In saying this, he had laid one hand on my shoulder, the other on my knee, and bending his face near to mine, looked musingly into my eyes, as if to meet a return of his proffered affection. I felt that I was surrounded by loving ones;  ; and folding this sweet boy in my arms, bedewed his innocent face  t with my tears. I believe this day was the first in which I could say that I ever truly loved any thing. My heart had been pre- viously encased in the cerement of selfishness. I entered this family not without fear of annoyance from the strict observance of religious formalities; but the apprehension i,?   THE PURE PLEASURES OB PURE MNDS.       17 gave place to a" favorable impression with my first experience. When we assembled at our evening meal, the first I had partaken with the family, Mrs. Carlisle made a slight inclination of the head toward Amy, who remained standing until we were all seated, and then laying her fingers lightly and reverently on the table, said the usual form of grace. It was truly beautiful; and I felt the worth of a pious example in so young a creature. I after- wards found that it was the practice of the members of the family to perform this duty indiscriminately. The dwelling of Mrs. Carlisle affobrded all the necessary accom- modations; and her hospitality made every nook a comfortable resting-place; and those persons to whom her house became a home, were denominated "standing guests." Of this class I was not alone. I found here a gentleman of the name of Lysander; but he applied to himself the term "Poor Scholar," an appellation of which he seemed to be very fond. He welcomed me with as much cordiality as though the house and every thing in it were his own; and there'was nothing in his manner, or in that of the family, to indicate that he was not perfectly independent of their charity, and of their opinions. In the domestic management of the house, the young ladies toolk charge, with the assistance of a single hired servant; the gene- ral orders only, being from Mrs. Carlisle. They attended to the kitchen, the order of the rooms, and the useful occupation of the needle. These were their morning exercises; while Willie spent the same hours in some light labor in the garden in summer, and in making fires in winter. Mr. Lysander would sometimes proffer his services in the garden, but being a theoretical rather than a practical gardener, he never used the spade or the rake without leaving something for Willie to undo. The child, however, was confident that he received many useful hints, especially with re- gard to the "adaptation of soil," from his fellow-laborer. So would Mr. Lysander often clear the parlor grate of a cold morn- ing, and fill in the coals, with the kindlings at the top, still be- lieving in the possibility, yet never succeeding, in propelling the heat downwards; and notwithstanding that Wilhe was invariably called upon to remove the coals, and begin the fire anew, the break- fast hour, on such occasions, was enlivened by learned disquisitions on the nature of the element of heat; and Mr. Lysander received the acknowledgments of Willie for imparting views so clear and rational on the subject.   18        OHARACTERBS UNVEILED ; OR, Mrs. Carlisle was herself the instructor of the young people. At the hour of eleven in the morning they all assembled in the school-room, where she attended to their studies with the assiduity of a governess, until three in the afternoon. Mr. Lysander had once formed, and never entirely relinquished the design of be- coining a colleague with Mrs. Carlisle, in the education of her grandchildren; but in attending to their lessons, he always found the pupils less ready to comprehend his teachings than he could desire; but he never put himself in a passion, and generally left the room regretting that Wilhe was too young for severe applica- tion, and that girls always received the greatest advantage from being taught by their own sex; otherwise he should be most happy to relieve Mrs. Carlisle of the entire burden of teaching, for he was not ignorant of the arduous nature of the employment. Indeed, he would sometimes converse eloquently on the subject of education, and often left us (for I also had become a pupil of Mrs. Carlisle) filled with admiration of his views.   THE PURE PLEASURES OB PURE MNDS.       19 CHAPTER III. Letters from abroad-The stranger-The song of the stranger-Hospitality-New enterprise-Indignation of Mr. Lysander-His very curious comments-Conversa- tions concerning the sick stranger-Miseries of a state of dependence. FoR six months nothing seemed to mar the happiness of this amiable family. I, alone, had a worm at the heart-the absence and estrangement of my'father. I had now seen and learned to appreciate domestic harmony and love; and an affection, the ex- istence of which I could not have been previously aware, absorbed all my desires, or concentrated them into one, that of again seeing my dear parent-under circumstances of reformation on my part. Little did I care whether poverty or wealth be our lot; to be with him, and to be happy in promoting his happiness, was the burden of my prayer, and the motive of my application to books. The wild chimeras in which I fiast indulged, on a knowledge of our misfortunes, had all left me, and given place to more rational views of happiness. One morning, letters from London were brought to Mi s Car- lisle. The bearer was said to be very ill at a hotel in town, where he arrived the evening before. The letters proved to be from Mr. Seablight, the brother of Mrs. Carlisle, and of whom she had received no intelligence for a vast number of years; but now, re- calling to mind the pet sister of his early days, he had resolved to visit her. He met with the stranger, by whom his dispatches were sent, at a hotel in London. He was a pious young man, but seemed to labor under some deep disquietude, on account of an estrangement from the friends of his heart. A thin partition separated their rooms, and Mr. Seabright was often induced to give attention to his prayers, and to his mournful soliloquies, of which he took notes, on one occasion, and transcribed them into his letter. This melancholy effusion Mr. Lysander put into metre, and called it the   20        CHARACTERS UNVIRTLn ; ORg Ziong oat * Ztrangtr. THOU sun, thou moon, ye twinkling stars, I see you still, where 'er I roam, Your omnipresent beauty wears A semblance of my native home. For still ye shine on those dear friendcS Whom I, no more, may chance to see And this reflection fondly tends To endear ye more to wandering me. And ye are all I have to greet, All that remain of former times; And here your light is softly sweet, As e'er it was in other climes. The world's a wilderness to me, With no congenial spirit near:- I mourn for the society * Of friend beloved and kindred dear l But hush complaint!-In worlds above I hope, at last, to find a home, Where I shall meet with those I love, And wish no more on earth to roam. There, in the bosom of my God, With all this fevered heart holds dear; My griefs at rest, I bless the rod, Which chastens and subdues us here. Mr. Seabright obtained the confidence of the unhappy gentle- man, whom he found suffering from ill-health as much as from de- pression of spirits; and an intimacy, so far as intimacy could be obtained with so melancholy a person, continued while they re- mained together. He often expressed a strong desire to visit the United States, his native country; and was not without the hope of finding there a relative and a friend. Mr. Seabright encourag- ed the desire, and offered to make him  the bearer of letters to his sister; and promised to follow him  in the course of a few months. He warmly recommended him to the favor of Mrs. Carlisle; and if he had the misfortune to find no other friends or relatives, he begged her to supply their place. "How is the stranger ." asked Mrs. Carlisle of Mr. Lysander, who had one morning been sent to visit him.   "Ah," said he,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      21 4 the dear fellow is very low, having suffered much during the voyage from general debility and sea-sickness. He is now in a high fever; and I was told that, in -his delirium last night, he asked repeatedly for you." "Attend to your studies," said Mrs. Carlisle,f I will be back in time for your recitations." But we could not study. The thought that my own father might at that very moment be sick and destitute among strangers, filled my mind with grief. And my cousins would only think and talk of their uncle Seabright, whom they had thought long since dead, and of the stranger, who had actually seen him and brought the assurance that they would see him too. / Mrs. Carlisle returned with the intelligence that the stranger would be brought to our house as soon as he was able to be re- moved. She had seen him, and assured us that she had never before been so much interested in an invalid, who was not of her own family; and that she should not be satisfied until she had him safely under her own roof. The first thing was to prepare a room for his reception. Our chambers were all occupied; but every one was willing to give up his or her accommodation " for Uncle Seabright's sake." It was finally decided that the chamber of Sarah and Amy, being the largest and most airy, and adjoining that of Mrs. Carlisle, should be appropriated to the use of the new guest; while the young ladies were to take up their lodgings in Willie's apartment, and Wilhe was to become a room-mate of Mri. Lysander. Willie rubbed his hands for joy at this arrangement, and Mr. Lysander was no less happy. Hourly did one or another of the family go to the hotel to make inquiries after the sick man, Mr. Lysander remaining with him as his nurse. Every wish of the in- teresting invalid was immediately acceded to. He seemed to have a childlike confidence in the care and attention of Mrs. Car- lisle; and that lady gave orders that she should be sent for, either by day or by night, whenever he expressed a desire to see her. In about ten days we had him removed. Mr. Lysander re- mained with him the first night; and the next morning he assured Mrs. Carlisle that he had not slept with such composure for many years; and he ascribed it to the satisfaction he felt on being'" at home." As, no allusion had been made to the means of our new in- , 5   22        CHARACTERS UNWTIJD; OR, mate, either in the letters of Mr. Seabright, or by himself, we rather considered him as being partially in want. This opinion was the more confirmed from the circumstance that the apartment which he occupied, at the hotel, had formerly been a servant's sleeping- room,- and was in a very dilapidated state,-by no means so good a one as the house afforded. Some arrangement must therefore be made to meet the additional expense which would be likely to incur from an accession to the number of the family. And if ever true joy, pure and unsullied, entered my heart, it was at that mo- ment-when I resolved to become a teacher of music for the ge- neral benefit, and for the sake of independence. The thought was sudden, but not the less exquisite.' In music lay the forte of my accomplishments. . And I knew that I should succeed. A teacher had just been advertised for, in Salem, and I immediately went out to engage the situation. As I approached the seminary my heart fluttered and sunk, and then fluttered again. As I touched the pull of the bell -my breath grew short; and when a colored man-servant opened the door, I half forgot my errand, until'he asked, "Whom do you wish to see?." "The person who advertised for a teacher of music," I replied. "Ah, well," said he, "perhaps they may have some one engaged, so many have applied. But walk in, I will speak to Mrs. M ." I was ushered into a room, where were pianos and other musi- cal instruments, and there desired to " wait."  After an age, ac- cording to the computation of my impatience, an elderly lady en- tered, and introduced herself as the "Principal of the establish- ment." And after questioning me as to who I was, whence I came, and in what way I was connected with Mrs. Carlisle, and in what manner I had employed my time since I had been in her family, she desired me to take a seat at the piano. I did so, and waited for further orders. After turning over the leaves of a newly-bound volume of music, she placed before me a favorite Mexi- can march, observing that she was particularly fond of martial music. The recollection of the admiration which had accompanied my performance of this march, so difficult of execution, was like a sudden inspiration; and to calm the perturbation which I felt would mar my attempt, I asked that I might first prove the instru- ment. After running over the keys, for a moment, I moved the notes to the left, which was my usual practice; and then, I be- lieve, in the true spirit of the composition, I commenced, and went through in such a style as I had never attained before. When I   ThEi PURzE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     23 had concluded, my auditress remained silent for a moment, and then said, "I will call some of the young ladies." It is sufficient to say that I was engaged at once, and at a high ;- salary, and was to enter upon my duties the next day. I then re- ? turned home.  But there is, sometimes, too great a fulness of joy as well as of sorrow; and, as I entered the house, I threw my arms around the neck of the dear girl who first opened my heart to love, by calling me the " new nestling," and fainted. When I recovered, I found mryself in my own room, surrounded by my anxious friends. The events of the morning had bewildered me, and caused me to faint; but I now was touched with shame for having made such an exhibition of my weakness. When left to ourselves, Sarah sat down on the side of my bed; and taking my hand, said, A My beloved cousin, you must not feel that this addi- tion to our family will give you the least annoyance, or deprive you of any portion of our attention ; neither will it lessen any of the com- forts which you have been accustomed to enjoy in our family. My grandmother lays by a small sum, quarterly, for sickness, or other pressing necessity; and Mr. Lysander has, this morning, engaged himself as a copyist, in the   office. So, you see that there is no present cause of alarm." I tried to tell her of my own good fortune; but it seemed so incredible, that I waited to be certain that I had not been deceiving myself. In the evening, Mr. Lysander put himself into a great commo- tion -of mind, to think that so good, so pious, and so interesting a personage as Mr. Preble-for that was the name of the stranger- should remain for more than two weeks at a public house, un- cared for, and unassisted by the more wealthy boarders in that establishment, whereas, a wealthy sojourner, sick and sorrowing, would have had the pressing attentions of the whole house, and a bulletin of his health published every molning. Why," said he, his indignation rising every moment higher and higher, " let a rich or titled man go into a city, town, or village, and in a day he is known to every man, woman, and child. His name, however difficult of pronnuciation, falls, harmoniously, from every tongue. But let it be whispered that a poor, untitled gentleman is present, perhaps sick, or in want of assistance, and his name becomes the hardest thing in the world to remember. And so continually is he annoyed by the entire neglect of one, and the new and strange appellations of another, that if he be at all ambitious, he will   24        CHARACTERS UNVEITD   OR, shift his quarters, and either commit a robbery, or give himself out as an 'exiled Count."' We laughed very much at the- strange conceit of Mr. Lysan- der; and I inquired of Mrs. Carlisle if she knew from what mis- fortune Mr. Preble had become so much depressed. To which Mrs. Carlisle replied, with some degree of hesitation, that her brother in his letters called him "Mr. Preble," and assured her that he was a most worthy man, that he came of a good fam- ily, and all that she could do for him would be returned with a thousand-fold satisfaction to herself and family. He also cautioned her against indulging in any suspicions derogatory to the character of the stranger, in consequence of the apparent mystery in which he seemed to be involved. And although," continued Mrs. Car- lisle, "I have every confidence in his worth, and believe him to be a most pious man, I do, not think that 4 Preble' is his real name." "I like him," said Mr. Lysanderl; 'let his name be what it will, I love him, because he appears innocent and childlike, and I pity his sorrows, be they what they may. But I have sometimes thought that he has been a monk, from his habitually religious feeling; perhaps expelled from the brotherhood for indulging in some affair of the heart, and in that case, having abjured his fam- ily name, and forfeited his religious one, he has assumed a third in order to die unknown. But he is worthy of our kindest attention, and we should each one of us regard him as a brother in adversity." After our kindest assurances of sympathy in behalf of the stranger, I made the communication of my morning's adventure, and received the congratulations of all present. There was no false delicacy to lead to expressions of feigned regret that I was disposed to make myself useful; but on the contrary, their approv- ing smiles, and encouraging words, strengthened my good resolu tion, and placed me on an equality of independence with them- selves; for however much they had endeavored to make me insen- sible of their favors, I did- feel that I was trespassing on their kind- ness, and falling in my own self-respect. And I now in candor acknowledged, that such had been my impressions, and that I had refrained from taking a part in their domestic employments from the fear of becoming a menial servant under the name of " poor relation ;" and that I found my energies, both bodily and mental, falling into a state of imbecility, when this new accession was made to the number and expense of Mrs. Carlisle's family. My ambi- tion then rose out of its supineness.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      2 oI should have been most miserable," said Ms, Carlisle, " had I known that such were your feelings." The young people too, with Mr. Lysander, were fearful that they had been remiss in those at- tentions which should have given me the assurance that my socie- ty was more than equivalent for all that they could do for me. I assured them that such was not the case, but on the contrary, their great kindness had filled me with a deeper sense of my own helplessness and dependence. I have since reflected much on the evils of living upon the means of others, and more particularly on the degrading and stu- pefying consequences of dwelling under the same roof, as compan- ions, with those on whom we are dependent for our daily bread. An equivocal equality among associates is less conducive to men7 tal development or social happiness, than is an acknowledged state of inferiority. The poor, who herd together, and feel that they are scorned for their poverty, enjoy the advantages of a definite posi- tion. They have sympathy in their sufferings, and their charities embrace the whole fraternity of the oppressed. They contem- plate their inferior station with bravery of heart, knowing that they and their posterity are not beyond the reach of good fortune; and we often find among them instances of bounding intellect, which a little of the sunshine of prosperity soon warms into sparkling luminaries. But the poor relation at the rich man's table crouches with fear, and suffers every independent sentiment to be crushed, until the mind becomes enslaved, and the energies cease to put forth in their own behalf. 2   26        CHARACTERS UNVFJTPrrD; OB, CHAPTER IV. Teaching music-Queries concerning a relative-The difference between being unjust in dealing and unjust in opinion--Willie's testimony in favor of Mr. Lysander. ARS. CARLISLE accompanied me the next morning to the semina- ry, and, as her character in the neighborhood was commendable, she was received with every mark of respect. After arranging that I should still continue to be a member of her family, she toolk my hand, gently saying, ' Courage, my love," left me with her eyes swimming in tears. She doubtless felt that my patience was about to undergo a severe trial. But the example of my sweet cousins had learned me to look to God for strength, and I then lifted my:heart to Him, not only in thankfulness for the means opened for my exertions, but in prayer that I might be successful in my calling, and prove a comfort and a consolation to my friends. I acquitted myself of my first day's labor to my own entire satisfaction, and, I believe, to the great delight of my pupils. Willie came out to walk home with me. He said that his grand- mother had been all day mourning over my troubles and my fa- tigues; and although my nerves were quivering from the effort I had made, I met her with an air of tranquillity and freshness. The sick stranger had been comfortable during the day, and was, to all appearance, convalescent. He had given Mrs. Carlisle the little information he had obtained concerning her brother, and in the evening many lively speculations were indulged in concern- ing that venerable personage. "Grandmamma, does he look like you?" said Willie, " for if he does, I know I shall love him." "I cannot inform you, my dear," answered Mrs. Carlisle, " for I have but little recollection of his looks, when lie left us; and, without doubt, the many vicissitudes through which he has passed, may have destroyed, in a great measure, the family resemblance."   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      27 "Do you suppose," asked Amy, ': that he will be in favor of the enlarged views of the ' female prerogative,' which is now engag- ing SQo much attention " "I thought you had forgotten all about that subject," said Willie, " since you have neglected to attend Mrs. Wiseacre's lec- : tures." "I have other sources for information of what is going on; I read the newspapers," said Amy, "and I am quite sure that our advancement in education, and in whatever else has a tendency to make us wiser and happier, is worthy of our attention, and should receive encouragement from all good men. I shall, therefore, ex- pect our" dear uncle to be on the side of the 'fenzale preroga- tive.1' "If he should be possessed of liberal views, and has been ac- customed to the society of educated and sensible women, he will not oppose any effort you may be disposed to make for your own improvement," said Mrs. Carlisle. "Do you think, my dear grandmamma," said Sarah, 6 that he is a pious man, and that he will be loving and familiar with us!" "All these things remain to be seen," replied Mrs. Carlisle, "but I hope we shall find in him both a pattern and a comforter." ' It is now my turn," said Mr. Lysander, "to ask a question. Is he rich?" "I hope so," answered Mrs. Carlisle, " for riches are a blessing, if rightly used. But if he be poor, he shall not be the less wel- come." "Ah, that's right," said Lysander. "If he come poor, here's my hand, and I will work the harder to assist in his maintenance. I shall even like him the better for putting it in my power to do him good." "But I have been wondering," he continued, "how he could stay away from his friends so long. Had he ever been absent, previous to this entire desertion of his home?" "No, never," said Mrs. Carlisle. "And though he left a kind father, and me his only sister. he seemed suddenly to have forgot- ten us. We did afterwards hear that he was living in the Island of St. Thomas. We made inquiry, but he had left, and we have since thought him dead." "Did he take any property with him!" asked Mr. Lysander. "He did," said Ms. Carlisle, "take a considerable amount. of n money." "Ah, there he did wrong," said Mr. Lysander. "Hie lost it,   28        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, doubtless, in some unfortunate speculation, and was ashamed t( return poor. It is always best for a man, going into agar countrJ to improve his condition, to take nothing with him. The chance is then in his favor; at least, he may return no worse off than hj went. But the vicissitudes to which the adventurer is liable, often cool the ardor of his attachment for home, well knowing that his reception among his friends is liable to be tempered, in its glad- ness, by the degree of prosperity visible in the manner and cir- cumstances of his re-appearance. The pride of entertaining a dis- tinguished guest, or of giving eclat to the coming of aprosperous relative, has often more to do in an ardent welcome, than have long-cherished affections, or the ties of consanguinity." "I am sure," said Willie, "that my dear grandmamma would never receive a friend with the less kindness for returning poor." Mr. Lysander gave Willie a most benignant look, and said, a But she is an exception. I never include her when I speak of general characteristics ;" and turning to Mrs. Carlisle, he added, ] 1 hope my dear madam, that this brother of yours will, in justifica- tion of his own conduct, come back, saying that he has been un- fortunate. He shall, in that case, have our sympathy; for we well know that while the rich and prosperous desire to shine in the pre sence of their relatives, and their early associates, the poor and un. fortunate find a relief in hiding their miseries among strangers But if he has been prosperous, he is hardly deserving of the regard which you will be likely to bestow upon him, since he has .neg- lected you for so long a period. And-now that every spark of af fection is extinguished in his heart, he is coming to claim from his sister those attentions which smooth the path of age and infirmity to the tomb. It may be possible that-he has wealth to bestow or yourself, and on those dear children. But I fear it will come grudgingly, for a contact with the world, and the spirit of selfish- ness fostered by those men who have neither wife nor children to keep their affections alive, must long ere this have acidified the sweet milk of human kindness which he drank at the same foun- tain with- yourself." While all seemed absorbed in reflection, and I sat musing or this ebullition of reason from the generally giddy Mr. Lysander, he suddenly started up, saying, "I hope he will come, since he must come at all, bearing the insignia of poverty, for then we shal] suffer less discomfiture from his presence. For if he be rich, ther he will be opinionated, and if he be opinionated, then he will be   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS .     29 haughty; and if he be haughty, then he will see no merit, either mental or moral, unconnected with the yellow dross, and will con- demn the unfortunate man, however worthy and deserving he may be, to unmerited disgrace, by treating him with the obloquy due only to a felon. I speak from experience,-that I do." ' Do not anticipate insult or effrontery from my brother," said Mrs. Carlisle. "I presume you will find him a just man." "Yes," rejoined Lysander, " doubtless, just in his dealings. But. he injures his neighbor less who is unjust in his moneyed transactions, than he who is unjust in his prejudices; for in the eyes such poverty casts a deep shade over a man's virtues, but brings out his most minute failings, and shows them up in all the shame of nakedness, and with all the aggravations of a public exposure. While wealth, on the other hand, draws a veil over the delinquen- cies of its votaries, but brings to view, with microscopic acuteness, and sets forth in bold relief, the least animalcule of productive goodness. And I'm  off, if we find him in the way. I'm off, come what will, if he goes to look down upon me."  And Mr. Lysander compressed his lips in a most determined manner. But suddenly recollecting that he should be in attendance on the sick, he left the room. "Our friend has been unfortunate," said Mrs. Carlisle, "and has suffered that hardest condition of honest poverty--with a cul- tivated mind, and fine and generous sympathies-neglect; his ac- quirements being of a purely literary character, are not available, and are therefore suffered to pass unnoticed. He sometimes ap- pears to be a little angry about it; but he is naturally good- humored, and does not take it much to heart." "Mr. Lysander is a good man," said Willie, addressing him- self to me. "He never hurts any body's feelings." But whether he intended, by saying this, to relieve my mind of any fear of envy or insult from Mr. Lysander, now that I was becoming inde- pendent, or to put me on my guard against committing any of- : fence by way of neglect, I could not determine. ,.   30        CHARACTERS UNVEJLrEn; OR, CHAPTER V.

THE next day Mr. Lysander entered upon his duties as B copyist. In the evening he came in, saying, "Great joyJ! great joy!" and twirling himself round and round. He then threw a roll of bank notes into Mrs. Carlisle's lap. "There," said he, "is money in advance; and now let us all be as happy as honest people should be. I will run, so I will, and see what the dear sick man wants, first of all." He soon returned, disappointed in his hope of doing good, and said, "The sick stranger would not have any thing."  i Nei- ther," said Mrs. Carlisle, who had looked over the money, " do we want any thing at present. And doubtless, your employer, in ad- vancing this sum, intended to intimate, not only that he was satis- fied with your capacities, but that the best of qualifications were undervalued beneath a threadbare coat." I believe it is true," despondingly answered Lysander; "for he looked at my clothes with what I thought too much scrutiny. But are they very much    worn?" continued he, examining the cloth on his elbows, and his knees, and pulling at his cuffs, and picking at his button-holes. "Why, surely I am  not ragged. I have a great faculty in making a decent appearance with very little expense; and now it would be too bad to buy clothes, when  I should have so much more pleasure in assisting  my friends." We all agreed with Mrs. Carlisle, that a  new suit of clothes was indispensable to his continuance in his present situation, as it was considered a reproach to any man, having clerks under him, to keep them ill-dressed. The poor scholar put up the roll in his pocket, ate but little supper, took up a lamp and went to bed,   THE PURE PLEASURES OP PURE MNDS.      31 where it is possible that vanity revelled in his dreams; for certain it is that his mind underwent a great change before morning. He was up with the dawn, and knocking at the door of the most fashionable tailoring establishment in Salem, before sunrise. At breakfast he could speak of nothing but the " new suit;" and it was with difficulty that he could be dissuaded from devoting the entire day to the making of so extraordinary a purchase.. At length he was convinced that staying away on the second day of his engagement, might make an unfavorable impression on the mind of his employer, and after a short interview with his tailor, ' went to his place of business with a bounding heart. Mrs. Carlisle had been up in town that day, and it being near my hour to return, called for me on her way home. As we went along, my arm being passed within her own, she pressed it to her side, and said, "Cousin, I want your advice." I replied that I was happy to find that she had so much confidence in my judgment as to consult me. "It may appear but a small matter to deliber- ate upon," said she, " and yet it may, if not properly managed, be productive of unpleasant consequences." "You must know," she continued, " that Mr. Preble, this morning, sent for me to his chamber, and putting into my hand a heavy purse of gold, de- sired'me to make use of it, for now that he had friends as well as fortune, he felt that he was doubly blessed. Shall I, dear Helen, keep this money for my own use, and lay myself and family under obli- gations to a stranger; or shall I return it to him, reserving only enough to defray his own expenses?" "The latter," I replied; "but great delicacy of argument will be neccessary in order to convince him that you are not the less his friend, because you do not avail - yourself of his bounty." "That is what I fear," said Mrs. Carlisle, "for to refuse his ! gift might, in his own enfeebled mind, seem to argue a suspicion of his worthiness. And truly, as we have no tie of relationship whereby to claim his kind offices, I would rather avoid the accept- ance of his money, which on our part would be equivalent to the contracting of a debt, with the aggravating circumstance that the obligation demanded concessions, instead of bank notes in pay- ment. I, however, would not be understood as expressing any doubts of the good character of Mr. Preble, or of the uprightness of his intentions." As we approached the house, Willie came running to meet us. "Dear grandmamma," said he, "Mr. Preble is up, and down stairs;   32        CHARACTERS UNVITEED; OR, and he says that he is at home, and you shall be his mother, and Mr. Lysander his brother, and all the rest of us his kinsfolk. Dear gradmamma, I like him very much." Mr. Preble met us at the door, smiling with the ingenuousness of a child, his face pale as death, and his limbs trembling beneath their weight. We led him back to a sofa, and Mrs. Carlisle pla- cing herself beside him, gently chided him for leaving his room. "You must be more careful, my son," said she, " and submit- to a little longer confinement." "I will," said Mr. Preble, "I will obey all your commands; only call me your son, and let me call you ' mother. Then my days, however few, will be days of peace and happiness." He wept like an infant, for sickness and sorrow united will break down the proud bearing of manhood. We laid him on the sofa with pillows and blankets, and drew around him, each solicitous to discover some want for the pleasure of relieving it. He seemed to be very happy; and looking round upon us, said, "Life and the society of friends have still some charms for the invalid." We seated him at the supper-table in an arm-chair. Dear Willte said grace, and to the usual form added a word for the sick stranger. I shall never forget how reverently he bowed himself on that occasion, nor the beam of gratitude which, on raising his eyes, -was directed to Mrs. Carlisle. He seemed to enjoy the meal, or rather his situation at table, for he ate but sparingly, after which he said, "And now, mother dear, I know you will think it best for me to be in my bed." When he had retired, his Christian patience and humility became the theme of conver- sation. "I think," said Willie, when he returned from kneeling by his bedside in prayer, " that he seems like one of us." "The sick," said Amy, " who are grateful for our attentions, always seem near to us-almost like relations. Besides this, the piety of Mr. Preble is so natural, that we fall into the spirit of it, as though it were a part of our own daily experience. I wish I knew the whole history of his life; I am sure it must contain some touching incidents. Grandmamma thinks his name is not Preble, and really he does not seem to answer to it, as if he were accus- tomed to hear it applied to himself." "Yet he may have a motive, and that not a sinful one, for concealing his own name," replied Sarah. "But where can Mr. Lysander be at this hour of the even- ing "       - He, at that moment, opened the door and answered for him- self. "Ah," said he, "my dear friends, money is the medium be-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      33 tween man and his comforts! There, do you see my new beaver and my kids? Well, upon my word, there will soon be an essen- tial difference between the Lysander of yesterday and the Lysan- der of henceforth. Why, bless your simple souls, a man in rags, and a man in broadcloth are not to be put down in the same cate- goly of human beings. But how is Mr. Preble? What pleasure I should have in making an outlay on him. He does not want clothes; he dresses well already. -He is a true gentleman, not in consequence of what he wears, but for his appreciation of the merits of this most worthy household. And were he but wealthy, who would deny that he is, indeed, a GENTLEMAN!" "He is gen- tle and kind," said Mrs. Carlisle, " and in his feeble health he is disposed to think well of those who sympathize with him; and he seems to love, us without reference to our merits, other than what he sees in our attentions, for his mind has become enervated by sickness, and his spirits are tender and grateful as those of a help- less and loving child." "My dear Mrs. Carlisle," said Mr. Lysander, "' your conjectures concerning the cause of his dejection are altogether erroneous, I can assure you. You, a gentle lady, never had the spirit of a proud man to break down, therefore you cannot dive into the mystery and the sufferings of a man's transformation when he be- holds want in the prospective. If his pride be accompanied by great sensitiveness and fear of self-debasement, he is- unmanned by degrees, until he becomes nervous and timid as a woman. Why, I myself, although I hate somewhat recovered from it now, have been quite through the metamorphosis which in him has just be- gun. And I can assure you that nothing makes a man resemble a woman in- feeling, so much as being honest, proud, poor, and perhaps in debt. Under these circumstances he becomes distrust- ful of his own ocular identity among his acquaintance. He looks into kind faces and wonders why they do not smile, and look en- couragingly on-him as they do on others.. He feels an ardent desire for kind epithets. His heart is desolate for want of sym- pathy. His tongue stiffens and hisses, when he bids it make his :  case known; and while he feels that his place on earth is con- tracted to the smallest possible dimensions for a living man, he dreads'the light of day, and fancies that scores of human eyes are watching all his movements. Ahl! the poor man! he is, then, just like a woman-a true, a veritable woman, who, though a stran- ger to guile, has yet neither-courage nor friends. And if this de- 2*   34        CHARACTERS UNVRTTrED; OR, scription of a man, transformed by adversity, is not applicable to the case of Mr. Preble, it will, nevertheless, be recognized in its operations on hundreds of others." "You do not mean to say," said Mrs, Carlisle, "that humilia- tion, such as-you have described, ever fell to the lot of an inno- cent man?" "Innocent!" said Mr. Lysander, " who that was not innocent could be a fit subject for such exquisite abasement. Could a man steeped in guilt experience that refinement of sorrow which we see in Mr. Preble? Not at all. There would be something of malignity in his endurance of poverty; and even a worthy man of ordinary sensibilities, and a good share of fortitude, would suffer as much and as deeply, without leaving a trace on his visible char- acter. But to my new suit: it is a long time, is it not, my dear Ms. Carlisle, since I have had one? And now I think of it, these were not of fine cloth, when I put them on. But with your mend- ing and my own care and brushing, they have worn well. . And they must be given to some poor wight, for I cannot indulge in the extravagance of two suits at the same time."  And Mr. Lysan- der went to bed, singing, to the tune of Kinlock, "I care not for riches, for honors nor pleasures; I'd grieve not though poverty press me sore; My mind is the storehouse of all my best treasures, And, far from expending, each day adds more. Then who shall say that I'm poor and distressed? Or that I, in sorrow, my fate have bemoaned? It is not so, for I'm sure I am blessed  With a heart where tranquillity sits enthroned." "He calls that the ' Soliloquy of the Poor Scholar,'"' said- Mrs. Carlisle, "and often -sings it when he is very happy. It is of his own composition, and written during a season of great pri- vation.  He bears adversity with a most surpising degree of non- chalance; and places the credit of all his happiness to his mental account, whether it be derived from that source, or from some- thing outward and foreign to his expectations." "It is," said I, ( a great attainment in the science of happi- ness, when men of learning possess themselves of the faculty of considering their own  intellectual endowments as their highest source of pleasure, since their enjoyments are complimentary to their understanding, and to their diligence in its improvement. But   (;w r: I    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      35 I doubt whether many poor scholars are as practically wise as Mr. Lysander." "No, indeed," said Amy, "there never was a wiser or more contented man than our dear friend. I find in the biography of learned men, those who have endeavored to shelter their vices, and the general hatefulness of their characters, under the acknowledg- ed merit of their talents; and the world seems to be less severe on the foibles, and even on the crimes of men of great intellectual powers than on those less favored with understanding. But Mr. Lysander has no faults to demand an unjust bias in his favor." "He is truly a guileless man," said Mrs. Carlisle ; " and I know not of an unworthy trait in his character. His errors can never be said to be any thing more than foibles." "And now," said she, " having experienced so many mercies through the day, let us unite in thanksgiving." We all kneeled,.and Mrs. Carlisle ad- dressed the throne of grace, giving thanks, and asking for future manifestations of Divine love; after which, the sweet voice of Saralh repeated the Lord's Prayer, to which we all responded a solemn "Amen."  How soothing, how profitable is family devo- tion! The next morning our interesting invalid was assisted down stairs, and sat at the right hand of Mrs. Carlisle, at the breakfast- table. His manner toward her was somewhat peculiar. It was reverence bordering ontimidity. He called her "mother," in an undertone, but with affectionate emphasis; and when she ad- dressed him as " son," his eye beamed, and his whole countenance became radiant with pleasure. Mrs. Carlisle walked out with me, on my way to the school. "I have not yet," said she, "had cour- age to return the money to the stranger. It might interrupt his pre- sent assurance of our kind regards, and break the tie which he ima- gines binds him to us with the strength of consanguinity. I will wait a little longer until he acquires more bodily strength; his mind will be correspondingly strengthened; and I can then make known to him my views on the subject of obligations of a pecunialy nature. Mr. Lysander is now profitably engaged; and as we have no need of any extraordinary expenditures, I am resolved to incur no debts, and such I should consider the appropriation of this money." I ventured to ask how it happened that Mr. Lysander should be invested with all the privileges of a member of her family without the obligation of contributing to its support?   36      - CHARACTERS UNVEILEDn; OR, After a moment of hesitation, she said, in an agitated manner, "Dear, deal Lysander, what is there that he would not do for our support?" She seemed much affected, and giving me her hand, in token that I had committed no offence, bade me good morn- ing, and turned her steps toward home.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       37     3 CHAPTER VI.- The Sabbath-Lysander's objection to public worship-A sermon at home-The effect. THE Sabbath came, and we were preparing for its services in the house of God. M1s. Carlisle proposed to remain with the sick guest; but Mr. Lysander, who, from some objections to the man- ner in which public worship was conducted, had ceased to be a church-going member. He, therefore, insisted on taking charge of Mr. Preble during the morning. Mr. Preble thanked him, and said, "I think, by taking your arm, I shall be able to attend di- vine service myself on the next Lord's day." "I should," answer- ed Mr. Lysander, " be happy to serve you with both my arms,-I would even carry you in my arms if it would gratify any particu- lar desire of yours; but you must excuse me if I decline your in- vitation to go to church, at all." "So, then, you have renounced religion!" said Mr. Preble. "Renounced religion!  No," replied Mr. Lysander. "I love religion-I love Christians; and I love the Sabbath too; but I do not like to see worldly pride carried intoe the Church. The All-wise Lawgiver designed the seventh as a day of rest, and not, of display and  comparison in outward show.  There is in it, if ightly understood, economy of life and health both to the body ' and to the soul. But its uses are perverted. From being en- deared to the poor, for the relief it gave from their labors, and for the season it afforded them for conference and instruction in holy things, it has finally become popular among the wealthy from the facilities it affords for drawing the lines of caste. And in no place are the distinctions, which wealth creates in society, so visible as in houses of public worship." I, being present, asked Mr. Lysander if it was not agreeable to him to hear preaching sometimes?  "Yes," said he, "Mrs. Carlisle is always preaching to us, both by precept and by ex-   38        CHARACTERS UNVEITLED; OR, ample. And that is the preaching I like." "And she attends church regularly, I believe," said Mr. Preble. "She does, indeed," replied Mr. Lysander. "Mrs. Carlisle never omits what she con- ceives to be the pelformance of a duty, because some others may do the same from an improper motive. But I have not the single- mindedness of Mrs. Carlisle. It is therefore a sin for me to spend the Sabbath in a place where my mind is liable to be constantly filled with envy and all uncharitableness. But we are not with- out suspicions that you, yourself, can preach; and Philip preached a sermon with only one man for an audience, and here you have two, a man and a woman," looking at me. "And now, if you will give your views of the Sabbath, whether as an institution of divine or of secular origin? and keep not back your opinion of the present mode of its observance in outward forms, I will listen with a mind open to a conviction of the truth; and if you can con- vince me that it is my duty to attend public worship, I will go this very afternoon." Mr. Preble, whose cheek seemed to redden, as Mr. Lysander mentioned the suspicion of his having been a preacher, replied, I "I have never been called into the public service of my Lord and Master; but I sometimes give expression to my own views among my friends, and as far as my strength will permit, I will give you my thoughts on the design and the keeping of this holy day. "You speak of the institution of the Sabbath as being either 'of divine or of secular origin.' The law-making portion of man- kind, having an interest in the industry of the subordinate, could never have made so great a sacrifice of their own profit as the setting apart, of one day in seven for rest and meditation, since those, from whose labors they derived their revenues, would be the first to take advantage of the privilege. To God, therefore, be- longs the gratitude for this respite of our common cares. And there are other privileges belonging to the Sabbath, exclusive of those of rest and quiet, and which, if used aright, never fail to enrich the soul with Divine love, and to season every enjoyment with a sense of the goodness and mercy of the one great Creator, who acknowledges himself our parent. Among these privileges is that of assembling ourselves together, and having our minds re- freshed with new assurances of our heavenward destination. "But pride, vanity, and hypocrisy, hang about this day also, and the house of God is too often made the theatre of their exhi- bition; so that many pious persons, particularly of the poorer   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      39 classes, choose the performance of their devotions in their own ' homes, rather than to mingle in a gay assembly, in an edifice en- cumbered with ornament, and listening to a preacher, nice in per- son, flowery in speech, and studied in fascination of manner. It is to be lamented that the pride, which is visible in many of our temples of worship, is so little calculated to impress the minds of an audience with the importance of the truth which they can- not fail to hear. It is almost to be regretted that the outward forms of public worship should be made agreeable to those who are indifferent to the inward principle. "But, however much we may see that is painful to the true Christian, it is dangerous to withdraw ourselves from the means of public instruction, for the same spirit which inspired the unsal- a; ied, ungowned, uncushioned, unflattered apostles, still breathes in our Sabbath sanctuaries-; and though partially obscured by the scenely, which makes preaching endurable to the votaries of fashion, and the fickle in faith, oftentimes bursts forth from the pulpit, and throws a spark into some poor soul, which otherwise had never been enkindled by a rayof Divine light. It is, there- fore, not well to endeavor to do away the public ordinances of the Sabbath day, even as they are now established, seeing that those who do so endeavor, are in danger, on the one hand, of be- coming misanthropes in the cause of religion, and on the other, of falling into dangerous heresies. For these causes it is more safe to seek after truth in those places where it may be found, than to withdraw our, influence from the fellowship we profess, as though we could be in more danger from witnessing the error of our brother, than from the mischievous conceit which prompts us to excommunicate the church to which we belong. "It may be, and, doubtless, is true, that the popularity of the most wealthy, respectable, and refined congregations is not alto- gether favorable to their spiritual excellence. But shall we, there- fore, sally off in search of more crude modes of worship, and either adopt a private course of ceremonials, or unite with such as condemn all precedent; or, perhaps, set ourselves up as New Lights, and thus add to the sects, already so numerous as almost to render Christendom a spiritual Babel? Shall we not rather en- deavor to check an overweening aversion to usages, which are often but incidentals in our peculiar modes of living, but hinder not true holiness in those whose unfeigned object it to worship f the true and living God . And while we see in the churches, of   40'        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, which we are respectivelymembers, a glimmeringof Gospel truth, we should cling to their interests with fervent prayer that there may be no dross in our own membership to add to the ob- scurity of the divine principle. But whatever trials we may en- dure from the unscriptural bearing of others, they cannot excuse us from maintaining a profound reverence for the Sabbath, and for the observances peculiar to that day; for without this, we shall not find it easy to maintain a tender conscience towards God, nor in the end to save ourselves from becoming Sabbath-breakers, which is usually the first step towards unbelief; and, finally, to the loss of all the hopes, the comforts, and the consolations of our holy re- ligion." Mr. Preble appeared to be considerably fatigued from  this effort in speaking, and Mr. Lysander, who had listened with pro- found attention, said he would accompany " old Mrs. Wilson" to church that very afternoon. , ;   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS&       41 Mrs. Wilson-Her admonition-Lysander's resentment-The way to be told of our faults-Humiliation of Mr. Lysander-IU nature a great truth-teller-Destiny. MRS. WILSON was an elderly woman, who resided with a small farmer about two miles friom Salem. She was infirm and frosty with age, yet wise in her admonitions; and Mr. Lysander, though he sometimes felt the galling of her reproof, never ceased to respect her, and was ever more desirous of rendering her favors than she to receive them, although she was stricken with poverty as well as with years., She had been J highly educated in the schools of learning, and thoroughly disciplined in the school of adversity; and although eighty years had gone by to dim the fires of her mind, and to allay the pride of independence, yet the lamp of her intel- lect was still blight and burning, and she preferred the paltry accommodations provided out of her own income-sixty dollars per annum-to living with more comfort upon charity, even the charity of her favorite church. When the weather was fine, Mrs. Wilson seldom failed to be at church, walking the entire distance, and as she passed by the door of Mrs. Carlisle, they often walked on together, and so fell in- to conversation, friom which resulted great good-will on the part of the Carlisle family, with whom Mrs. Wilson was invited to dine on the Sabbath, and often remained to rest and sup before she re- turned home; but further benefits she would not receive. On this memorable afternoon, Mr. Lysander resolved to walk beside Mrs. Wilson to church.  He had often marvelled at the pleasure she manifested in being able to attend public worship, under a weight of years, and what appeared to him to be an odious appearance of poverty. And she, in truth, was one cause of his complaint against the church where she, with the Carlisles, at- tended. His lament was, that they did not set her up as a favored   42        CHARACTERS UNVEILETn; OR, light in the congregation, and thus show to sinners, that piety, and not wealth, exalted the member. He, on this occasion, sat by her, and opened to her the lessons, but she closed her eyes, and re- peated from memory. On their way home he asked her whether she found in her religion a solace for all the privations that fell to her lot 8 Mrs. Wilson was for a moment silent and reflective, as if sound- ing/the depths of her resignation, and then replied: "'I cannot say/that I do. The flesh has its requirements as well as the'spirit, and not until we put off this mortal body, this hungry dependent on creature comforts, can we subsist on spiritualities alone." '"True," said Mr. Lysander, " but are not our wants diminished as we advance in years?" "Our wants," replied Mrs. Wilson, "become less numerous, but more urgent as our time draws near. It therefore becomes us, not only as men and women, but as Christians, to make, while strength is on our side, provision for our age, and for our final ex- penditure, that our latest devotions may not be marred by the ter- rible questions,-under whose shelter -shall I die? and who will provide for me a coffin and a shroud ."  "I have found, in other years, and to my sorrow," said Mr. Lysander, that the home, which is only ours on certain conditions of payment, and our finances not always adequate to those condi- tions, without subjecting us to other straits, is but a home on suf- ferance..- Yet it is better than having nowhere to live." "It must be a very great trial to have 'nowhere to live,' " re- plied Mrs. Wilson, " but a greater one to have nowhere to die! Those who give us food and shelter for a pittance, when in health, reject us when disease comes upon us-with its demands for help; and death stands ready to consign us to the hands of the anatomist, through want of the means to put us into those of the undertaker." "I cannot conceive, my dear Mrs. Wilson," said Mr. Lysander, "that you are governed even by a probable issue, in your unhappy foreboding'." "You do not take note of the preliminaries, and are therefore blind to the issue," replied Mrs. Wilson, somewhat reproachfully. Mr. Lysander, whose heart was ever alive to the distresses of others, was meditating on words of comfort, and designs for the  i relief of Mrs. Wilson, when he found himself thus suddenly ac- cused of drawing positive conclusions from false premises; and as silence was always his best argument in his own favor, he made no   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       43 reply, and Mrs. Wilson, as she halted, leaning on her staff, thus addressed him: "Excuse me, young man, if in my description of a union of poverty with age, I own that I have a desire to arouse your atten- tion to the necessity of providing for yourself a home, wherein you may close your mortal career, without anxiety concerning the hand that is to minister to your last wants, and with the assurance of repose for your lifeless clay. "Nothing. is so humiliating, so hopeless, as to feel our faculties decaying, our energies giving way under the imbecility of years, and no home, no shelter for our gray hairs. In age we want com- fort and independence, more than at any other period of life. We feel then, in its full meaning, that exclusiveness belongs to proper- ty, and that we have no title to the means of another. Even in youth, when there is a hope left of acquiring an independence, this truth is painfully evident. But alas forage, which dislikes to be under authority, and loves comfort and quiet, when it has no place wherein to nestle and die! And let me assure you, my young friend, that the right employment of life, in a temporal as well as in a spiritual sense, is to prepare for the end. The caterpillar weaves her shroud, and dies quietly within her own precincts. -Shall we, creatures of intellect, be less provident than the worm 2" After this, they walked on in silence, Mr. Lysander accommo- dating his pace to the slowest movement of Mrs. Wilson, until they reached the house, where he related the whole discourse to Mr. Prekle, without the least appearance of having taken offence, and even said, "Help me, my friend, to confirm myself in a habit of industry, that I may provide against the day of want." But in a little while, it occurred to him that there had been a sly intimation of his dependence on the charity of Mrs. Carlisle, contained in the admonition of Mrs. Wilson, and he complained that her reproof was both gratuitous and uncivil. "I never owed her any thing," said he, "and why should she scandalize me for my indebtedness to another? But if she really found herself possessed of a zeal for my good, there was no necessity of making that zeal offensive. I never object to good advice, and I could hear of my faults with- out displeasure, were they commented   upon with any degree of courtesy." "My   dear fellow," answered Mr. L ,ole, "you are now falling into one of the strangest errors of self-love, and one which cuts off entirely the benefit of admonition."   "       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, "I do not understand you," said Mr. Lysander.  "I only meant to say that I was willing to be reproved but not abused." To which Mr. Preble mildly answered, "There are many per- sons who think they are willing to be told of their faults, provided the communication can be made in an agreeable manner. But it unfortunately happens that no one has ever been able to adopt a method of making such intelligence agreeable. We hear our own praise with pleasure, even from the mouth of an enemy, but we listen to censure, although from our kindest friends, with impatience, -notwithstanding that our good sense may lead us to profit from the reproval." "Well," said Mr. Lysander, " her age gives her the privilege of demeaning us who are younger." "Rather say," rejoined Mr. Preble, "that it is the privilege of youth to receive instruction from the counsels of age." But Lysander's self-love was wounded, and his good-nature felt itself insulted, and he protested that if the church-going rich were haughty and distant, the church-going poor were bigoted and in- solent, and that the last was worse than the first. And so the good impressions which had, in the early part of the day, been made on the mind of Mr. Lysander, were all dissipated by an allusion to his present, and probably future, poverty, which, in banishing from his own mind, he had also banished the probability that it could ever recur to the minds of others. The next afternoon his new suit came in from the tailor's. But Mr. Lysander looked upon it in the evening without any mani- festation of pride. He felt that his dependence was known; per- haps his meanness a by-word. The scanning of his dress by his employer, and the advance pay, now appeared like comments on his penury; and amounted to an assertion that it was neither from choice, nor from the, eccentricity of character which sometimes distinguishes men of learning, that he seemed never inclined to moult. And he went the next morning, and for several succeed- ing days to his employment, without exhibiting ary symptom of pride in his improved appearance. We all sympathized sincerely with him. Mis. Carlisle redoubled her attentions. Mr. Preble extolled his learning, and commended his goodness of heart in terms of great warmth. The young ladies hung round him, as- suring him that he was dear to them as an elder brother. And Willie called me his dear little love of a tuzzen, because I hemmed and marked the new handkerchief for Mr. Lysander. Yet no one   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS,       45 appeared to disprove the sentiments of Mrs. Wilson, nor to con- demn the motive from which she uttered them. And Mr. Lysan- der no longer regarded her as the cause of his mortification, but as the faithful friend desirous of his welfare'; and although he still continued to think that her manner savored a little of the wormwood of censure, yet he resolved to take it kindly. "It is not always,': said he, " those who give us honeyed words, that confer the greatest favors in their remarks. Ill-nature sometimes tells us profitable truths, which good-nature would see us die for want of. But, alas! I fear I am the victim of what she, in her conversations on human sufferings, sometimes calls Destiny,'. and surely, if that be the case, my lot, like her own, is cast in an iron mould."   "       CHARACTERS, UNTVE ITLE; OR, ,?.

BUT our troubles, as well as our joys, are destined to come to   an end, and so the "Poor Scholar," as he now insisted on being  called, found it after a few days. One evening he returned in  perfect glee with a huge volume of newspapers, which he placed ,' against the wall, and to which he pointed his finger in a most I theatric manner. "There," said he, "is the germ of an imperisha- f:^ ble fame! That volume is illuminated by a scintillation friom the ' :? genius of,--ladies and gentlemen,-of your most humble ser-   ? vant." Here he -bowed to the company all round. And then bounding off into the ludicrous, began skipping and admiring his :-(:i! own renovated exterior, vociferating, at the same time, "Behold :i? me, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Preble and Master Willie, behold mne, who, but a few days since, wasin a state of both outward and inward  dilapidation, now completely renovated!-rehumanized!-a man!  f -and the recipient of a most betwitching ogle." "An ogle!" cried one. "Who is she?" asked another.   "Where did you see her?" demanded a third. Mr. Preble smiled at what he supposed to be a chimera; and Willie gave himself up to the joy of his friend, without regard to the cause. "There is," said Mr. Lysan- : der, " a certain divinity called 'Fortune,' known to be of the femi- nine gender,firom her appreciation of externals." "But," said Mr. Preble, "Fortune is represented as a blind goddess: her eyes ban-  daged, so that she can neither ogle, nor be moved by outward ap- ;t pearances." "As to that," said Mr. Lysander gravely, 'the band- age is a mere invention of the cynic. She may be capricious. and  distribute her gifts, too often, without regard to merit, but her favorites can tell you that the light of her eye is radiance!! And j my whole soul is at this. moment kindled and glowing with a ray ?   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.   ,   47 of the divine illumination." Here he twirled the big book, and blessed the day that he first set foot in the office of The as a copyist. ': But it is all owing to you,. Mr. Preble, it is all owing to you, who came, by our desire, to help us eat our morsel, when the fear that we might all suffer from the leanness of the larder, sent me out to seek employment, and this propitious event has opened a new era in my existence." Amy, who was altogether a matter-of-fact sort of a person, and always wished to come at the bottom    of the budget at once, walked up to Mr. Lysander, and .asked him whether this scene arose from disgust of his employment, or was it the preamble to some really important communication ? "I am sure," murmured she, " that it is quite ridiculous to tantalize us in this way."  " Mr. Lysander is never ridiculous," said Willie, with more warmth than TI had ever heard him speak before. " No, never," said Mr. Lysan- der, "often sublime! but never ridiculous."  And here he at- tempted to come at something in the book as an evidence of his sublimity, but he was so agitated :that he could not find it. "The tea is ready," said Sarah, "Mr. Lysander loves tea; and I once heard him say that he could always best elucidate over a cup of young hyson."  He was then going into a new ecstasy, but Mrs. Carlisle implied, by the usual sign, that he should make the cus- tomary acknowledgment. There was no reproofin her manner; but his tumultuous joy was instantly calmed, when called upon to acknowledge that all good came from God. He laid his hand upon his heart and asked the Divine blessing. The tea things being removed, he brought the book and laid it on the table; and after finding the important passage, he turned down the leaf, and apologized for the excited state of mind in which he had appeared before us that evening; and particularly for indulging in antics before Mrs. Carlisle. But he assured us that an explanation would more than satisfy us that he had great cause of self-congratulation. "I beg you to believe," said Mrs. Carlisle, " that your apparent exultation has given me no offence, this evening; but when we give way to unbounded vivacity, deep depression is apt to follow, as you have lately experienced. But believing that you have really something agreeable to communi- cate, we shall be most happy to learn what it is, and to let you make the communication in your own way." " My dear Madam," said Mr. Lysander, "my best, my only true friend, it is to you that I bring my happy, my too happy  48        CHARACTERS UNVIT On5; OR, heart. But in order to explain, it may be necessaiy to bring up reminiscences, which, from your silence on past events, are either unpleasant in their associations, or avoided from a feeling of deli- cacy toward myself." 'All explanation that can be made," re- plied Mrs. Carlisle, " must exalt the character of Mr. Lysander in the estimation of my family, and of the world. I therefore leave it to your own discretion to make your communication in whatever way you may think most proper. You may, perhaps, enlighten our young people on some subjects of minor importance, about which they are often inquisitive, but which, for the sake of those, who were deal to both you and me, I have not felt myself at liberty to explain." Here Mr. Lysander, who had planted himself right before Ms's. Carlisle, and was regarding her with an expression of the most pro- found satisfaction, elevated himself in his chair, and looking over his shoulder at the young Burleighs with a sort of good-natured resentment,-"And so you suspected that I had no business here, did you n." "I did not mean," said Mrs. Carlisle, " to lead you to infer that they supposed I had any secrets concerning you to keep from them. But I do not think it always proper to satisfy chil- dren's curiosity concerning the affairs of older people. "You are perfectly right" said Mr. Lysander. "But as children should be punished for their idle speculations on older people's character and standing, I shall consider them as no part of my auditory this even- ing' "But you would not," said Mr. Preble, " exclude Miss Bur- leigh, the cousin, and myself from the privilege of hearing " "It does not matter," peevishy answered Mr. Lysander, " rI'll warrant that you all have your conversations about me; you may hear as much as you like, only keep it in mind that I am addressing my- self to Mrs. Carlisle, and to her alone." Mrs. Carlisle took blame to herself for disturbing his equanimity, and desired him to go on, as- suring him that she was impatient to share his happiness. ,     /, k *' x  .,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     49 CHAPTER IX. Lysander's communication-The return from an errand of love-The breakfast--The scruple--Employment-The sleeping apartment-Kindness--Gratitude. "You remember," said Mr. Lysander, "that near ten years ago, I returned from my Western tour, where I had been lecturing on the vanities of wealth; that I returned dispirited and very poor; that after seeking you for a long time with a hopeful heart, knowing that my poverty would be no barrier against a kind reception,  found you,--alas! not as I expected, in New-York, and in comfort, but in Boston, in a mean apartment, and that in the most obscure part of the city, supporting youself by the sale of little paintings and fancy ornaments, the work of your own hands. It was in the morning when I entered your chamber. You were sitting by a table, your breakfast on one part, your work on the other, mole in- tent on examining the latter than in discussing the former You arose to meet me with the same dignity, the same self-composure, as when, in better tim, I entered your splendid mansion in Broadway. I began to weep, and to make a great tumult against fortune, thinking that the best way to comfort you. But you, smilingly, assured me that you were not unhappy, and adding another cup of coffee, and another roll to the morning repast invit- ed me to partake with you. A conflict arose in my mind, whether I had a ight so to do. But hunger overcame my scruples, and your kindness was such as toshow that Iwas not only welcome, but a relief to your solitude. "After breakfast I inquired what I could Ado to assist you? What would you be willing to do ' you asked.  [Here we all Irew nearer. Sarah threw back her curls that she might hear with more certainty. Amy went to the side of her grandmother's hair, and said, coaxingly, "Do let me stay here." W hile Willie went up behind Mr  Lysander, and smoothed down the hair upon he sides of his head, and kissed him, and was allowed to stand   50        CHARACTERS UNVEILEDD; OR, there and listen.] It now occurred to me that I had, in my boyish days, been a tolerable miniature painter; and I doubted not that I could paint -landscapes and other little devices, suitable for the embellishment of the trifles which you assured me found a ready sale. I therefore eagerly desired that I might be allowed to assist you in that department. This proposal was very agreeable to you, as you thought that part of the process the most tedious, and to yourself the least satisfactory. After furnishing me with patterns and the materials for paint- ing, you went out to make sale of your little wares, and returned with the requisites for a good dinner-so thought I. You admired my work; and, truly, I was myself astonished at my skilfulness in the ' divine art.' In this way I was soon happy to find that I was a help rather than an incumbrance to you. , Generally inattentive to my own appearance, after I became a lecturer on the ' vanities of wealth,' I did not discover, for the space of a week, that my habiliments were improving. True, I knew that you had provided me with a change of linen, etc. But one morning in dressing, I took up a little wooden peg, that I had pressed into my service in place of a button--and lo! a button was there. This led me to reconnoitre, and I found that I was in com- plete repair. I at once knew how you had managed to do this thing. I slept in the end of a passage at the head of the staircase-you / had placed a small cot there for me, and had hung up a curtain before it ; but the recess being very small, I threw my clothes, every night, on a chair outside the curtain; and there, in passing up and down the stairs, you discovered them. And how kindly, how thoughtfully, how patiently, how nicely you mended them, and in those moments when nature required that you should have slept." Here Willie went and kissed his grandmother, telling her that he was proud of her. And we all followed his example, in acknow- ledging the goodness of Mrs. Carlisle. And, now, Mr. Lysander got up and shook hands with us all, saying that he was perfectly re- conciled to us, every one; and that he had been talking to us all the while, and not so much to Mrs. Carlisle, for she knew it all before. We now arranged ourselves on each side of Mrs. Carlisle, forming a semicircle in front of Mr. Lysander, who afterwards ad- dressed himself to all present, speaking only of Mrs. Carlisle in ; the third person.                       : "My first impulse," continued Mr. Lysander, "on entering Mrs. Carlisle's room, was to express my gratitude; but my heart    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      51 was too full to speak. As I drew her attention to my improved appearance, she tapped me on the arm, and said, 'I love to do such things; therefore do not mention it.' My first request was that I might now attend to the sale of our work. This proposal met with her entire acquiescence, as it relieved her, she assured me, from every unpleasant circumstance connected with her neces- sities. I thus found myself doubly useful, and felt that my ami- able hostess, in some measures leaned upon me; and there seemed to be a sort of manliness about me, that I had never realized be- fore. Though humble my endeavors to sustain myself and my worthy benefactress, I felt an elevation of soul, which neither the comparison with the more honorable callings of others, nor the querulous haggling of my customers could abate.  I felt that I had no time for study, and therefore confined my reading to one daily newspaper. But in the conversation of Mrs. Carlisle, as we sat at our daily labors, I found a never-failing source of interest; and notwithstanding my late unsuccessful attempt to convince mankind of the superiority of learning over wealth, her wisdom and under- standing renewed the impression and confirmed me in my some- what declining opinion, that a Well-stored mind was the best sup- port under adversity, and the truest source of dignity and happi- ness.                          c   52        CAHRACTERS UNVEILED; OR, CHAPTER X. Christmas presents-The removal-The bedroom-The busy night-Uncomfortable reflections-Labor and pastime-Disregard of old acquaintance. "WE continued our labors, and the summer passed on. The autumn followed; and, at length, Christmas presents were in de- mand. There was novelty in our manufacture; and we had, by this time, become acquainted with more liberal purchasers; and our profits were such as to make labor a pastime; for, in every de- partment of industry, the burden is wearisome where the compen- sation is inadequate; but heavy pay makes the most arduous task light. "At the beginning of winter we moved into more comfortable apartments, and in a good neighborhood, where Mrs. Carlisle had been formerly known as a summer resident; but where she did not design to be first in renewing the acquaintance. "I must first describe my own apartment, and my sensations on taking possession of it. It was a bedroom, with a real door! not a bit of calico. Oh! what pleasure I had, at first, in opening and shutting that door; how I loved to hear the latch ' click.' Besides my bed, I had a table, a chair, a small looking-glass, etc., and a strip of carpeting. There were several pegs in the wall, on one of which I hung up my recently-bought cloak. The filst night I occupied that room, was one of memorable activity. I placed my little articles of furniture in a variety of positions, view- ing them in each new phasis with an eye to the most perfect har- mony in their arrangement. I hung up my cloak right-side out, and then wrong-side out. I placed my boots under the table, and under the chair, and under the bed, and beside the bed, and be- hind the door; and finally hung them up beside my cloak. I lay down to see how things looked about my room, when in bed; and then I undressed and went to bed; I then got up and took the looking-glass with me to see how I, myself, should look lying   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      53 there. Perfectly satisfied with my appearance in repose, I laid the glass on the table, blew out my lamp, and began a sort of enumeration of all the articles we had made and sold for the last six months, and how many we were likely to make and sell for the six months to come, when it suddenly occurred to me that the piece of carpet, which lay at full length beside my bed, might appear to more advantage, and serve a better purpose if spread the other way, that is, the end to come up to the bedside, and so run down in firont of the table. It was but the work of a moment to scrape a match on the wall, and relight the lamp. The carpet was quickly put about; and, truly, it did look a deal better, and I could have a view of a part of it as I lay on my pil- low. ' I again extinguished my lamp, and tried to sleep. But now it occurred to me that to hang up my clothes would be better economy than throwing them on a chair, and would give me a more enlarged view of my wardrobe. I was soon busy in arrang- ing and in rearranging; and when I again laid down, peering at my suspended habiliments, first with both eyes, and then with only one eye, I felt perfectly satisfied that the order of my room was in the highest state of perfection. But I did make one more effort at improvement that night, and only one: It was after my first nap, when my waking fancy hinted that my boots were out of place, hanging up there, one on each side, and as high as the collar of my cloak. I therefore bounded out of bed, and taking them down from the pegs, placed them, standing upright, imme- diately beneath my pantaloons. Assured that they were now in their proper location, and seeing that all things were so combined as to present an agreeable aspect in the morning, I returned to my bed. But nowy sleep had left my pillow, and ungenerous reflec- tion had come in its stead, and all the peculiar traits of my own character passed in review before me, leaving no bright trace behind; and the question occurred, with mortifying force, 'Why am   I not, like other men possessed of education, talent, and family influence, a stay to myself, and a pillar in society?' I an- swered the inquisitive monitor, ' that I had been pursuing a wrong course through life. That nature designed me for the service of others, or, in other words, for a servant. I knew it from my wil- lingness to conform to my situation, anld my readiness to serve others sooner than myself. But that my eccentric godmother-- Chance, instead of carrying me straight to the kitchen, had tum-   54        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, bled me, by the way, into the schoolroom, where I soon attached myself, with great ardor, to books. But I must own, said I, em- phatically, that it was an unfortunate adventure for me; for, in after years, with all the refined sensibilities which books instil into our natures, I have often sighed for the 'sweet music' of the dripping-pan! "We had a very commodious parlor, which served also for a kitchen and a workshop. A door opened from this apartment into Mrs. Carlisle's bedroom; and not a week passed that we did not add something to our, at figst, scanty stock of furniture; and we enlivened our labors by an effortt at amusement and improve- ment at the same time. We conversed in different languages on different days. In the ancient I had had the advantage of more study, and was monitor; but, in the modern, Mrs. Carlisle had the most practice, she having travelled much in foreign countries. But as we were about equal in our dependence on each other for the ' correction of errors,' we kept ourselves in perfect good-humor. "Although it was known in the neighborhood that Mrs. Car- lisle was residing there, in a state little above mendicity, yet she had not a single call firom once devoted friends. Indeed, so much had the affairs of her family been forgotten, that I, with my black and curly head, and pale dark complexion, was taken, as I passed in and out, for the son of Mrs. Carlisle, with his auburn hair and florid countenance, o"   THE PUR PU LEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        55 CHAPTER XI.

" AT the beginning of February we had   a large collection of valentines to dispose of, and with them in a portfolio under my arm, I sallied forth into the gay thoroughfare, where the shop win- dows do so bewitch at that season.  I applied to a dealer in for- eign books and fancy stationery, who was our most reliable patron, and whose delicate inquiries concerning our resources, I had most un- hesitatingly answered. He took an interest in our proceedings, and was almost sure to be pleased with, and to pay liberally for, our merchandise. Seeing him busy in conversation with a gen- tleman who was about to purchase some books, I laid the portfolio on the counter and waited. The gentleman was a foreigner of distinguished appearance, but in who6m there seemed to be a set- tled melancholy, partially concealed by a haughty mien. Speak- ing the English language with tolerable correctness, and being a purchaser of some consequence, the shopkeeper appeared disposed to give him his undivided attention, and desired me to call again in the morning. But he having opened the portfolio, the paint- ing caught the eye of the strange gentleman, and appeared to in- terest him. I therefore proposed to leave them, comforting my- self on my way home, with the hope that he would become a buyer, and so enhance the value of my commodities, at once, in the estimation of the merchant, and thus secure me an immediate sale. I was not disappointed, for when I called again in the morn-   56        CHARACTERS UNVEIED ; OR, ing, I found that he had selected some of the best, and had paid a generous price for them; and the others were already placed in the windows and the show-cases. I ventured to set a price on them, somewhat higher than I intended the day before, and it was paid without hesitation. I inquired who the gentleman was, to whom I was indebted for so favorable an opinion of our handi- work? The tradesman informed me that he was a foreigner of distinction in his own country, exiled 'for some political offence. He added, that the stranger had asked my address, and that he had taken the liberty of giving it. This time I returned home, not with hope but with certainty, for I felt that there was some little ponderosity in the coin (the only weight that is never found to possess too much gravity) which I carried in my hand. "We purchased, that day, a larger stock of good things for the table than we had yet done; together with fuel, and oil for our lamps. But we did not forget, first, to supply ourselves with materials for the next operation in business. I was exceedingly happy, and asked Mrs. Carlisle if she was not so too. LI am,' said she, 'as happy as the comforts of this life, and the company of my dear Lysander can make me. But I have sorrows, inde- pendent of my daily fare, that rankle in the heart and"' Here Mr. Lysander seemed to check himself, and looked toward Mrs. Carlisle, as if fearing that he had made an allusion to some- thing very painful. She was pale and agitated, and seemed struggling for breath. At length a flood of tears came to her re- lief. We were greatly alarmed, and wept without asking the cause. Poor Mr. Lysander fell into a fit of passionate exclama- tions against " fate,"-" for nothing less could ever have exposed so good a woman to undeserved affliction." I had noticed the manner of Mr. Preble, during the whole course of Mr. Lysander's narrative. He listened with the nervous attention of a person who had an interest in every sentence. He often wiped the perspiration from his pale brow, and watched the countenance of Mrs. Carlisle. Willie and I exchanged glances, significant of our notice of his deep attention. Willie noted it as admiration of the character of that excellent woman, and felt grateful to the discernment of the stranger. But to me there ap- peared to be something more than admiration employing his thoughts. But when, on the allusion being made to the hidden grief of Mrs. Carlisle, he left his seat and strode about the room, and then threw himself upon the sofa, with an involuntary but deep   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       57 groan, I imagined that there must be a cicatrice in his own heart, suffering laceration from sympathy with another. Mr. Lysander felt that he had wantonly opened a source of grief in the bosom of Mrs. Carlisle, and his dejection was truly pitiable; but his honest heart acquitted him of any want of ten- derness for her peace of mind. "My dear Mrs. Carlisle," said he, "the happiest moments of my life, have been those in which I have contributed to your peace and comfort; and the greatest sorrow I could now feel, would be to fall under your displeasure." "My good Lysander," said Mrs. Carlisle, " my greatest earthly comforter, I do you the justice to believe that truer words were never spoken by human being."--Here Mr. Lysandeir became an exceeding favorite of us all. We crowded round him, touching his hands, his clothes, and his hair; and Willie kissed both his eyes; while Mrs. Carlisle smiled her approbation on us all, and motioned for us again to take our seats, which we did, as near to her as possible, and at no unnecessary distance from Mr. Lysan- der. Seeing Mr. Preble still lying on the sofa, pale and despond- ing, it was proposed that the conversation be suspended for the evening. But he would neither allow the narrative to be discon- tinued, nor would he retire, although he acknowledged that he was unable to support himself on a chair. After those little min- istrations to his comfort, which he seemed to require, Mr. Lysander proceeded in his relation. "That same afternoon we received a visit firom the Senhor. tHe offered no apology for bringing himself into our presence, but con- versed with the ease and familiarity of an every-day acquaintance. Whenever he could not express himself well in English, he would make use of some of the foreign languages, of which he seemed to have acquired several; and  he manifested some degree of pleasure, but none of surprise, when Mrs. Carlisle would promptlv construe his meaning into literal English. He visited us almost daily, taking an interest in our work, and often assisting with his pencil in our designs. He never pitied our condition, nor' ap- peared to feel that we were not entitled by fortune to all the re- spectful attentions, which etiquette requires from members of the higher classes of society towards each other. He brought news- papers, and read them to us, and was fond of conversing on the literary and political intelligence of the day. Sometimes, as I have since thought to gratify my own particular vanity, he would go back with me in review of studies belonging to my classical edu- -     8'"3:   58        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, cation. He was a profound scholar, such as the old countries often produce, where fortune gives leisure for the cultivation of the mind. He allowed me to feel no envy toward his superior ac- quirements, but raised me in my own estimation, by bringing up the long dormant lore from my own memory. Our college read- ings were all reviewed and commented upon. Personally, we were strangers to each othei; but our hearts came into unison through the fellowship of associations, we having drawn our intel- lectual treasures firom the same fountains of knowledge. When- ever my recollection showed more aptness than his, he received the aid as a favor; and when I was at fault, he gave the desired instruction, delicately reminding me that he was some years my senior. It was evident that he had become attached to our so- ciety-that he loved to be with us; and his partiality was fully reciprocated on our part. I thought that we were a most happy trio. But all who are fond of learning, and of science in general, must be aware that among the lovers of literature, there is a hid- den tie, a mysterious attachment, which exists, independent of the vicissitudes of fortune, almost overlooking moral delinquencies. When two or more meet together, whatever privations they may outwardly endure, they are prepared for an intellectual feast; and always find, on separating, that their stores of good things are in- creased rather than diminished. Indeed, the more numerous the partakers, the greater the quantity laid over for another season. Ah, my dear friends," continued Mr. Lysander, as if he did not al- ways enjoy the privilege, " what can bring to the human heart so great satisfaction as to be able to contribute a liberal share to a mental banquet" ." "It is natural for us," said Mr s. Carlisle, " to love the society of those with whom we can converse freely on subjects nearest our hearts. And we can never be weary of the company of such as respond to our sentiments, and confirm us in our opinions, or dis- place them by giving us those which are better." After giving Mrs. Carlisle a look full of pride of her good sense, Mr. Lysander continued: "But the visits of one, so elegant in externals, could not escape the notice of our opposite neighbors. A white hand and a well- oiled moustache, with the air of unstudied elegance, denoting rank, have peculiar charms for ladies; and the little fly-caps of the mam- mas, and the flowing curls of the daughters, were in hourly sport at the windows, without even the screen of a lawn curtain. Flower-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      69 pots, with the compliments of Mrs. or Miss So-and-So, came in, in abundance; and the state of Mrs. Carlisle's health, became a mat- ter of great solicitude. Our visitor was not altogether unknown in fashionable society, as we learned from a gossip in another part of the house, he having accepted several invitations to parties; and had once oven an entertainment at his hotel. The hereditary dignity of Mrs. Carlisle,--she being a descendant of one of the most illustrious exiles who landed on the rock of Plymouth,- with her superior 'mind, education, and the benefits derived from travel, were supposed, even by the, most envious, to be enough to secure the esteem of the fastidious Senhor; but how she became so fortunate as to make the acquaintance, living, as-she did, in so retired a manner, puzzled the wisest heads in the interest of the distinctions of wealth. "One Sabbath morning our friend came, as he said, to accom- pany us to church. And so he walked on with us. Now, as we were poor, and could not, without great sacrifice to our pecuniary  means, pay for a sitting, Mrs. Carlisle proposed that we should take a ' free seaf.' This, at first, was very wounding to my pride. I felt it a public degradation. But Mrs. Carlisle assured me, that once accustomed to our place, we should not only find it comfolt- able, but wholly unattended by those misconceptions on the part of others, which would be sure to lead to mortifying disclosure of our poverty. 'It is an undeniable truth,' said she, ' that those who fear not the exposure of their destitution, are far more happy, and have more self-respect, than others, who attempt to keep up the appearance of affluence without the necessary means. The rubs that are given to the former but rasp and grate the outward rind; while the darts that are aimed at the latter pierce the inmost core.! "I became a convert to her opinion, and accompanied her with all humility to the meanest part of the church; and never were my devotions more sincere, or my responses uttered with more fervency, than while there, making one among the poor of the congregation. But I must own that I felt an unwillingness to ex- pose to our guest the circumstances which served as a weekly ac- knowledgment of our poverty before the whole house. From those of regular attendance I had nothing to fear. Nobody appeared to know where I sat. But this stranger, with the lofty bearing of a grandee,-could we conduct him to a seat among paupers 8 Mrs. Carlisle saw my perplexity, and kindly whispered,' Leave it   60        CHARACTERS UNVEITEDn; OR, to me.' We entered the sanctuary, and wound our way to our accustomed place, Mrs. Carlisle taking the lead. , And as we stopped before the rude bench, she bowed, and with a graceful motion of the hand, inducted the Senhor to his seat. I had never before seen, in my dear friend, so much of that superiority which is above the gifts of fortune, as on that occasion. The Senhor felt the propriety of her conduct, and bent himself with an air of reverence which would have done honor to a queen. Several pew-doors were immediately thrown open, of which, however, no notice was taken by our party. The stranger was evidently un- used to our Protestant form of worship, and more than once made it' manifest to the congregation that he was a devout Catholic. "As we retired, many were the pressing invitations that we re- ceived to ' take seats in a better part of the house.' Mrs. A. as- sured us ' that her pew was never full, by at least three."  Mrs. B. 'had a friend who would always be happy to accommodate the juvenile portion of her family, and room could be made for us all without the least discomfiture.' And Mrs. C. I recollected that she had two pews.' Mrs. Carlisle received their attentions with as much composure as though they had been of every-day occur- rence. I, also, thanked them civilly. But the Senhor made no acknowledgment, and only said, 'I -sit with Mrs. Carlisle,' at the same time offering his arm to that lady, and we proceeded home- ward, amid a profusion of smiles and recognitions. "From that day, our door was beset with carriages, and our parlor thronged with ladies--all friends of Mrs. Carlisle. Our work was necessarily removed into my bedroom, to give place to our visitors, and Mis. Carlisle had not a moment during the day to devote, either to our necessary employment or to our once familiar and instructive conversation. The Senhor visited us as usual for some time; but one morning he made his appearance very early, and informed us that he was going to another city, from whence he should sail, after a few weeks, to his native country, the political disturbances which had made him an exile having been amicably settled. With an emphatic 'Remember me,' he left us. It is hardly necessary to add, that we soon had the privilege of resum- ing our labors, without being interrupted by friendly calls! But our sudden popularity had demolished our credit. Quarter-day had come, and we were not prepared to meet it. Our Landlord, who lived in a part of the same house, threatened to seize on our movables, and turn us into the street. Past punctuality' he re   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        61 marked, was no guarantee for future payments, when business was given up for the pleasures of society.' We did not feel that we de- served the reproach, since our late loss of time was not of our choice. "I think this -was the hardest struggle that I ever endured, not on my own account, but through anxiety for my venerable friend. Mrs. Carlisle bade me not despair.  I have,' said she, 'the old silver tankard that came over in the Mayflower, and which you and my son used to honor as a sacred relic. I have been loath to part with it.  I valued' it, at first, for its antiqui- ty, and the associations connected with its transfer across the ocean; but of late I have kept it, that I might have something available in sickness, or other emergency. And this is the emer- gency, in which it must be available.' I thought it downright sa- crilege to part with it; but Mrs. Carlisle vetoed the rising mur- murs, and brought out the precious plate, clean and bright, and wound up in a pure white napkin. I took it with an icy hand and shrunken heart. -I remembered, oh! how fondly I remem-/ bered,"   and Mr. Lysander and Mrs. Carlisle both wept. We knew not why they wept; but- we mingled our tears with theirs. Mr. Preble, who had, until now, lain quietly on the sofa, asked to be assisted to his chamber. He was immediately conveyed to his bed. He seemed nervous and afflicted, but would not consent that Mr. Lysander nor Willie should remain with him. They therefore returned to the parlor, and Mr. Lysander resumed his narrative. "With the old tankard pressed against my heart, I went from place to place to find a purchaser, who would be willing to give something like the true value; but no one seemed inclined to re- gard it as any thing more than a piece of old plate, fit only for the mint. In my walks I reflected much on the social terms of society. And it appeared to me, after our experience of the consequences of the attentions of the opulent and idle, that the poor had little cause to complain of the neglect of their wealthy neighbors, since their visits, as we found to our sorrow, was but a laying waste of the time, the improvement of which is the only dependence of those, from whom fortune has withheld her gifts. I have heard it asserted, that the rich do sometimes assist the poor to that degree, that they appear in the face of the world as equals; but I cannot conceive that a constant fear of giving of- fence, or of being caught in dishabille, or detected in conference   62        CHARACTERS UNVEILTEn; OR, with some low associate, or in repairing old linen, or in eating a dry crust, or in the performance of some truly menial office, is at all compensated by the gifts which are inadequate to independence, or by the honor of calls from people of fashion,-calls which too often end in grievous remark, conveyed by another class of friends to the ear of the humble and mortified recipient of idle atten- tions. The contact of the rich and the poor is, in almost every respect, unfavorable to the moral dignity of the latter. They gen- erally meet with fear of imposition on one side, and the cringing, for favor on the other. There is a class of refined and delicate poor. They know not how to labor with their hands, and their talents command no patronage. In all humility and lowliness of spirit they ask favors of the wealthy and benevolent. They are not always spurned, for there are those who are truly well disposed toward the suffering, and who give from feelings that do honor to the human heart. Yet even by those who act with a kindly intent, the rich- ly endowed by all the gifts of nature, and acomplished in- all the acquirements of education-yet wanting help, are not treated as rational men and women, but rather as truant children, with a mix- ture of kindness and severity, more depressing to the proud heart than severity alone. But necessity compels the acceptance of aid, and both the giver and the receiver are absolved from offence in the sight of God. "There is, again, a class of the wealthy with whom the poor are sometimes brought in contact, and they have no hearts to feel for the miseries of the destitute, seeking them only- when they can use them as stepping-stones to some important object; then, indeed, they will give money freely if required; but the gift seals a bar- gain, in which the receiver loses all self-respect, added to a hate- ful sense of obligation. "In these reflections, I had great consolation that we had taken neither alms nor bribes from our visitors. The day had worn away almost imperceptibly. I was now in the suburbs of the city, my treasure still undisposed of, and I was about to return, when seeing a man closing a shop window, inside of which I observed a quan- tity of silver ware, I thought of making one more effort, and of- fered to sell him the tankard. My manner must have appeared very suspicious, for he called a policeman, and gave me into custo- dy. I was locked up until the next morning, when inquiry proved my innocence, and I was set at liberty. I found Mrs. Carlisle, who b   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       63 had not slept during the night, full of grief, and she wept inces- santly during the day." This account filled us all with deep emotion. But Mrs. Car- lisle, smiling, said, ' That is all over now ;" and she requested Mr. Lysander to continue, assuring both him and us, that although these facts were vivid in her memory, she could not conceive what connection there was between them and the recent good fortune of Mr. Lysander. "Dear grandmamma," said Amy, " do not turn the attention of Mr. Lysander from a subject so interesting to us, as that of a part of your own history, to the trite concerns of an old newspaper." "Why bless you, my pretty piece of impatience, said Mr. Lysander, tapping with his fingers on the heavy volume which lay on the table, " but the consummation here is glorious, and you will soon acknowledge that I have come up to it in a most lucid and straight-forward manner." "And what did you do for the rent?" asked Amy, with visible impatience. 6"I went," said Mr. Lysander, s to our friend, the bookseller, and acquainted him with all our difficulties, and with the cause. He kindly offered to loan us money, somewhat exceeding the amount due for rent, taking the piece of plate into his own keep- ing, to be given up whenever it might be convenient for us to re- fund the money." "And did you get it back?" asked Amy. "Oh! how I should like to see it," cried Willie. I thought of a use for my first payment; Sarah looked into the face of her grandmother, as if she feared it would never be seen more; and indeed, Mrs. Carlisle put her handkerchief to her eyes, when Mr. Lysander bounded fromflMis chair, and seizing both her hands, "My dear Mrs. Carlisle," said he, " to-morrow shall that precious fragment of the freight of the 'Mayflower,' be again put into your hands." There was a general burst of joy, Mrs. Carlisle weeping and laugh- ing by turns. So delighted were we all, that we quite forgot that any thing remained to be told, until Mr. Lysander called our atten- tion to the subject. "Every thing being settled in a comfortable way, I thought I should like to make an effort at scribbling, as my articles, though anonymous, had ever been well received. Mrs. Carlisle had often counselled me to take some recreation in this way; and now, having a subject on my mind, it would be, for a few days, a most de- l,   "       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, lightful pastime, preparatory to a renewal of our mechanical labors, I collected all the observations I had made, and all the gossip I had heard on the character and conduct of the Senhor, and em- bodied them in a sketch-fanciful, it is true, but retaining enough of the original, to be at once recognized. I read it to Mrs. Car- lisle, and her unqualified approbation determined me to offer it to the editor of our best weekly periodical. The publication was in high repute, and a new conductor had just entered the editorial sanctum, and on his table, before his face, I laid my communica, tion. "It was a good thing," said Mrs. Carlisle, " and I have still no patience with the stupid editor for rejecting it." "I know it was good," said Willie, " if Mr. Lysander wrote, and my grandmamma approved it." "How much I should like to see a copy of it," said Sarah. "He has verylikely kept one," said Amy. "Indeed, he did not," said Mrs. Carlisle. "He wrote and re-wrote, and then destroyed every vestige, but the one unfortunate copy ; unfortunate in falling into such injudicious hands." I strongly suspected, from seeing Mr. Lysander curbing a truant smile, which seemed disposed to hasten the-denouement, that the manuscript had. not been quite so unfortunate as was at first apprehended. "Ah, well!" resumed Mr. Lysander, " it was a clean and well- ! written sheet; and I went myself, and handed it to the new editor of the I Weekly   .' I intended to purchase a few copies of the number illuminated by my genius, for gratuitous distribu- tion,-one to be forwarded immediately to our friend, the Sen- hor; not doubting that he would be flattered by the manner in which I had attempted to immortalize his eccentricities. But judge of my surprise, when week after week passed, and no notice taken of my communication. I was broken-hearted to all further effort in business, and I -so hated every thing connected with news- papers, that I abandoned their perusal, and would sooner walk a mile out of my way than go by a printing office. At last I re- solved on making one more tour through the country, to cry down, to demolish, to annihilate the Press. I determined to be- gin at Baltimore, that city having the honor, or rather the dishonor of giving birth tothe editor of the ' Weekly . .' So calling on the bookseller, who promised to look after Mrs. Carlisle, I took leave of my dear friend, here present, and shipped on board the 'Polly Drew,' working for my passage as a deck hand."   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        65 CHAPTER XII. Arrival in Baltimore-Designs on the Press--How frustrated--Humiliation--Editorial kindness-Niclknames-Liberality of the Baltimore Press-The friendly planter- Return to Mrs. Carlisle-The wisdom of experience-The cottage-An unknown friend-Modest pretensions-Important discovery-The premium-Division of money--Great satisfaction of Mr. Lysander-His notion of the way to receive good gifts. AFTER two weeks of tumbling among ropes and tar, and with fre- quent ablutions of salt water, I landed in Baltimore, with soiled and torn habiliments, and a pair of hands, which indicated more of the stall than of the forum; but I determined to show that the ability to sway public opinion was an inward, and not an outward excellence. With the little stock of money in my possession, I paid for a week's board in advance, and then set myself down to arrange my ideas for a public lecture. I intended first to show, that the Press was a cause of languishment in the human judgment, inasmuch as it brought opinions, ready concocted, to the minds of the multi- tude, who had nothing to do but to receive, passively, the im- pression of a few dies, wielded by that potent and never-tiring machine, dividing the community of thought into sections, each bearing the stamp of the die which it happened to run under. I should also contend, that the method of instructing an adult pop- ulation by the ancients, was far more conducive to mental action and independence, than the one practised by us,-that of instruct- ing through that common medium--the newspaper. It was the design of the ancient philosophers to instill into the minds of men the necessity of mental action, and the teacher stood before the multitude, face to face, so that if any man had a mind to make his comments, or even to gainsay, he had the chance of being heard viva voce. One hour of speaking on an important subject, puts more mind into activity than ten hours of newspaper read- ing. And it is an undeniable fact, that reading of this sort has a   "       CHARAC'TERS UNVEILED; OR, tendency to strengthen the prejudices ; and many persons who have no principle of thought or action which is the result of their own convictions, will unite with a party or a faction, and take in every one of its assertions as fundamental truths, and vaunt them as un- deniable. They even become more tenacious of their adopted princi- ples, their accommodating dislikes, and their obliging partialities, than are the true holders of their own preconceived opinions. It is easier to wield a spade than to make a spade, should be their motto. Thus I intended to argue with the public, until I could convince them that since this mistletoe, the Press, had fastened itself upon the ' tree of knowledge,' they, the multitude, were living upon the mistletoe, and not enjoying the wholesome fiuit from the tree." Here we could no longer suppress a laugh, in which Mrs. Car- lisle joined, rather to the discomfiture of Mr. Lysander. But Amy, who had great regard for the reputation of one, who, she believed, had always been a friend of the family, seemed a little mortified, and asked, with some anxiety, "What did the people say to such an odd sort of lecture 8.X - Say? why, bless you," said Mr. Lysander, "' they said nothing; and I will tell you how it happened. After I had worked myself into a suitable preparation for the onset, I went out to procure a room for my first lecture; intending to placard my notices in manuscript, and to charge but a moderate fee for admission. But I 'must have an endorser, that pay for the room and the gas- lights should be forthcoming.' Ah! here was a poser. I was nonplussed at once, and saw with infinite regret that I had been misled by the heat of my resentment, and the caprice of my ima- gination. To add to my vexation, my self-appointed mission be- came a subject of notoriety. And I was described in some of the dailies as ' the little man who would do great things.' You may well suppose that I was badly off.? "Dear Mr. Lysander, I am  sorry you went," said Willie. "And so am I," said Sarah and Amy, and so said I. "Well, it was not so bad, after all," said Mr. Lysander, " for there was in the same house with me an editor of one of the dailies. He had shown me great civility, and seeing my forlorn situation, and finding that my education was above my odd and indigent appearance, he kindly offered me some employment in the literary department of his office. After a little further ac- quaintance, during which I found that I was rising in his estimation, he asked me 'how it happened that I should entertain the wild fi'eak '!   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      67 of pulling down the Press ' and, why I had chosen Baltimore as the theatre of my filst exploit in the attempt 8' Now, I hold that when a man falls into difficulty, either innocently, imprudently, or even with bad intent, the worst thing that he can do is to attempt to lie himself out of it; so I told him the truth, and acknowledged that I had made a most ludicrous mistake. He made himself a little merry at my expense, but made me an offer of such com- pensation for my labors as would soon enable me to pay up ar- rearages in Baltimore, clothe myself decently, and carry me home to my kind friend, Mrs. Carlisle." "And was you not very glad to see him, grandmamma ." said Amy. "I should have been overjoyed, if I had been here," said Willie. "But you were all here," said Mrs. Carlisle, "and yet no- body rejoiced but me, for you did not know Mr. Lysander then." Willie put his hand within that of Mr. Lysander, saying, "We know you now, Mr. Lysander, and love you too much to let you go out to be slighted and rejected again." "I did not go out to be slighted and rejected," said Mr. Lysander; "I went the first time on an errand of love. I intended to make the poor content with- their poverty; and the next, to clear the country of what I thought to be a downright imposition; and my mqtive being good on both occasions, I am satisfied with the re- sult, since it has brought no injury upon any one. But let me go on with my story. It seemed very strange to me that I, having nothing to recommend me to the notice of the public, should be recognized wherever I went. But to convince me that there was no mistake about my indigence, I was known by a variety of nick- names, and feigned appellations. The tyros in literature called me the ' Poor Scholar,' a sobriquet, which I have since proudly ap- plied to myself. The shopkeepers called me ' Threadneedle,' be- cause I sometimes bought thread and needles to repair my own clothes. Among the boys I was-known as ' Anti-Pressman ;' and the little girls would say, 'That is Mr. Editor C 's poor gen- tleman!' and they would drop their pretty courtesies, if I hap- pened to pass by them. But the slaves, who have, generally, a great contempt for 'poor white folks,' designated me as ' The man of no account.' "For six months I toiled as diligently as my constitution would allow. And I now prepared to return to my dear Mrs. Carlisle, determining to devote the residue of my life to her comfort and happiness.   68        CHARACTERS UNVRTtLD ; OR, "When about to take my departure from Balitimore, a purse of money was made up, by several gentlemen connected with the press, and offered me as a testimony of their good will in parting. But I rejected the proffered assistance, telling them that I was happy in having become acquainted with them, and in this proof of their confidence in the uprightness of my intentions; but I was unwilling that the last act of my stay in Baltimore should sully the character which I flattered myself I had acquired for indepen- dence. And that a young man of talent and education, whose prospects had never been clouded by misfortune, should be asham- ed to accept that, in the way of charity, which his own efforts should command as a reward. There was present, at this time, a kind-hearted, and plain-spoken old gentleman-a planter, who had shown me many marks of esteem, and always treated my preten- sions with deference and respect, and at whose plantation I often spent the Sabbath. I believe, from the frequent introductions of his thumb and forefinger into his vest pocket, that he intended to drop something into my hand unseen by others. But him I hap- pily disappointed, without the pain of a refusal. He seemed, at first, a little silent and reserved, as though I had deprived him of some anticipated pleasure. But he accompanied me to the station, where I intended to take the train for the north; and before we parted, he asked me to write to him, and to let him know how I found our dear friend, Mis. Carlisle. And in conclusion he said, 'You know, Mr. Lysander, that I like the man none the more for his cloth, and none the less for his want of cloth. I can appre- ciate merit under any garb. But the result of my acquaintance with you is the opinion, that if talents and learning will not pro- cure us a living, we had better be without them, for they are ac- companied by extreme sensitiveness; and as they will be sure to bring us into notice, sufficient to expose our faults as well as our necessities, they may be considered as a source of the most refined vexations.' ' This good man had studied my character with the eye of an 'artist; and seemed to have made my case an axiom, and to have deduced from it a necessity for forbearance with the waywardness, and sympathy for the sufferings of intellectual refinement, when- incapable of exercising the 'diligence that maketh rich.' "It may have appeared ungrateful and unkind in me to leave Mrs. Carlisle as I did. But she, seeing my unsettled state of mind, and believing it best, under any plea whatever, for me to   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      69 quit, for a while, the scene of my mortification and disgust, did not oppose my wild intention; but made me promise to return to her when I had finished my work, whether covered with renown or loaded with opprobrium." "And did you really, grandmamma," said Amy, " attach any importance to Mr. Lysander's designd" She motioned silence, and smiled a significant, no. And Mr. Lysander went on. "As I left Mrs. Carlisle, in whose unwavering friendship I had the most perfect trust, I looked back, and smiled and nodded, as much as to say, that genius would soon be enabled to soar above the condemnation and repulsion of newspaper tyrants. My nod and my smile were answered by a tear! I do not'know what she could think of so wild an adventure. "I returned a wiser, but not a prouder man than I went; for Fame came not before me with the cry of ' Great Reformer!' I informed Mrs. Carlisle that I had found myself to be no match for that great antagonist, the Press; and I compared myself, in my late attempt, to a testy, toothless infant, biting at the thumb of its father, while the good old dad only pitied and soothed its ill temper. She was pleased to see me bear my defeat with good- humor. "On my return I found her here, in this pretty cottage, sur- rounded by these young people, mere children then. It is more than eight years since. She informed me that she had received the property as a gift from some unknown friend. The convey- ance was made by deed in her own name as purchaser. The house was furnished, and enriched by a valuable library. A sum of money was, also, remitted to her, quarterly, through the post- office; who the donor might be, she could not tell."-"And here," continued Mr. Lvsander, " has been my home ever since. I have not been all the time idle; I have sometimes been a teacher, sometimes a copyist, but still remained, and do remain, a debtor to a generous woman." "You grieve me, Mr. Lysander," said Mrs. Carlisle. "Do you account as nothing,"-a Can I ever repay you," interrupted Mr. Lysander, " for the early favor with which I was received into your family?-for the fond approbation with which you anticipated my espousal with your angel child ." Mr. Lysander could say no more. We all turned our eyes upon him, as if a new and endearing re- lationship had suddenly sprung up between us. 'Willie sat down close by his side, and looked up in his face with a strange mixture   70        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR,            - of love and astonishment. Mrs. Carlisle was the first to speak. "My dear Lysander," said she, " the tie of which you have spoken, should be enough in itself to cancel all obligations of a pecuniary nature between you and me. But I am wounded when I hear you call yourself a debtor, where the sacrifices" "I do entreat you, my dear and only friend," again interrupted Mr. Lysander, " not to call that a sacrifice, which was a pleasure; and since it is true that I never have contributed to the good of your family, by any worldly wealth of mine, why make me odious in the sight of these young people by making me appear as a creditor, even in design, to their remotest relative? If that hateful barrier-a feeling of obligation-be placed between them and me, where shall be my home? and who shall I call my own " "We are all your own," cried Sarah, and Amy, and Willie; and I cried as loud as the rest, "I, too, am your own." "See, dear Mrs. Carlisle," said Mr. Lysander, " they are all my own!"  "Yes, and dear little tuzzen, too, as much as any body," said Willie, who was pleased to hear my voice, in response to the general acclamation. Mrs. Carlisle looked round upon us all with an air of the most perfect content, exchanging smiles with Mr. Lysander, who then resumed his narrative with as much com- posure as if no interruption had taken place. "When Mr. Preble came among us, sick and in need of many indulgencies, I felt it a shame to remain idle and dependent on the little income of Mrs. Carlisle; and as I had succeeded better as a copyist than in any other capacity, I resolved to seek employ-  ment in that way. You all know the result as far as the purchase of the new suit. Nothing material happened from that time until to-day. When I entered the office this morning, my employer said to me, ' You will be at leisure for an hour or so, until some expected documents come in. And,' added he, 'you may, per- haps, amuse yourself by Iooking over that volume of old news- papers ;' and he pointed to the one which now lies on that table. "Although I still felt a shrinking at the sight of a newspaper, yet I brought out the volume, laid it on the desk, and opened it. What should it be but the detestable, the execrable ' Weekly ,' and of the same year as the date of my unfortunate corn- i ^!' munication. I drew back, and breathed heavily; but a vengeful desire to become once more indignant induced me to turn over the leaves. I commenced my examination with the number from   :i'i: which I dated my justifiable horror of editors, and looked over its :   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     71 pages, but without any return of the wrath which I had experi- enced on a former occasion. My fire on the subject had been ex- tinguished, and I moved on, mechanically and dreamily, noticing only the heads of the articles; at last,--What! What! ' THE SENHOR.' I rubbed my eyes, and opened the window, and looked out. I tried to be certain that I was awake. You all smile that I should have attached such high importance to so very a trifle; but trifle though it might be, and soon might it have been forgot- ten had it but met with a gracious reception, I felt that to have it rejected without even an acknowledgment, had wounded my pride so deeply as to justify me in a full measure of resentment. The poor man, rendered exclusive by education, and made sensitive by privation, doats on the offspring of his own mind; and is touched in a tender point, when he feels that his only hope is being con- signed to ignominy. ( I left the volume open on the desk, intending, with affected indifference, to point out the article to my employer. He soon appeared, and laying down a bundle of parchment by the side of the book, cast his eye over the page, and laying his finger on the important sketch, said, 'I should like to know who the author of that article could have been. He either must have died suddenly about that time, or perhaps he was too rich and too proud to claim the very handsome-deposit left with the publisher for his benefit.' What sum?' said I, in a terrible tremor. ' For whose benefit was it? What was it you said 8 and what did you mean .' I Did you- write it.' he asked, kindly. ' Truly I did,' was my im- mediate answer. 'Well, then,' said he, 'keep cool, and we will see to it this very day.' "Preceding the article was an apology for declining to notice it sooner, as it was at first suspected that it might be a translation. And in the third succeeding number was a request to see the author, as a gentleman, supposed from his appearance to be the original of the sketch, had called and left a check on the Bank of ---- for One Thousand Dollars, to be handed over to the author. The gentleman himself being on the eve of setting sail for Eu- rope." Here followed an uproarious scene in Mrs. Carlisle's little par- lor. The old folio was opened in two places at once; and while three were reading aloud at the same time, I, with Mrs. Carlisle, was searching for the Premium; and our voices, also, might have been heard in joyful exclamation, while Mr. Lysander was so trans-   72        CHARACTERS UNVEITR; OR,           -- ported, to see how happy he had made us, that he turned a so- mrerset. After a while calmnness was restored, and Mrs. Carlisle, lean- ing over the volume, as it lay on the table, read to us Mr. Lysan- der's interesting sketch.  We, of course, saw much merit in the article, and began to vie with each other in praise of it; but Mr. Lysander, with much good sense, as well as modesty, remarked, that, in a newspaper paragraph, if a personality were at all flattering, it was sure to. be received with favor by the one, however fastidious, for whom it was intended, although it might be defective in point of sentiment, diction, or even good taste. He then proceeded in his details of the events of the day. "I immediately went, in company with my employer, to Bos- ton, and called on the publisher of the ' Weekly  ,' and as- certained that the money was safe, with the interest, which had accumulated thereon. The ex-editor was the gentleman to whom I had delivered the manuscript. He resided in Brooklyn, and thither we hastened to see him. He knew me instantly, and con-   - gratulated me warmly. He was ready to make affidavit to my right to the money, but thought it necessary to add the testimony ; of Mrs. Carlisle to his own. He informed me that the Senhor  was highly pleased with his own portrait, saying, he should pre- sent it to his friends in his own language. He bought several copies, and sailed for Europe the next day. "And so," said Amy, "he deceived you, and had not gone from Boston."  It is highly probable," said Mrs. Carlisle, " that he found his presence was becoming a disadvantage to us, and so 'withdrew, under pretence of necessity for leaving the city." "He was perfectly in the right," said Sarah, "for in order to keep up the acquaintance, without the annoyances accompanying it, he must have made his visits at unseasonable hours; and I know my dear grandmamma would never allow any one to visit her house by stealth." "He acted with great delicacy," said Mrs. Carlisle, "' and was, doubtless, gratified when an opportunity offered of doing us a favor in such a way as would appear to confer no obligation; and, certainly, his generosity was equal to his consider- . . atlon."  It was now late at night; and after composing ourselves to  ;^ come before the throne of grace, with our thankful hearts, we united with Mr. Lysander in pouring out the warm effusions of our ?- !y ';   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     73 gratitude, and, commending our future lives to the kind care and guidance of our Creator, we retired--all but Mr. Lysander, who thought he should prefer looking over the old volume to sleep. It was past four in the morning when I heard the high- sounding notes of chanticleer, in the distance, and the low warbling, "I care not for riches, for honors nor pleasures," of happy Mr. Ly- sander, as he passed my door, on his way to bed.' The next morning Mrs. Carlisle went out with Mr. Lysander to make the necessary deposition. They soon returned, and at Mr. Lysander's request, Wilhe was permitted to accompany him to Boston and Brooklyn. Mr. Preble was feverish and dejected in the morning; but the final account of Mr. Lysander's adventure cheered and revived him. "You see," said Amy, "what good has already come of your being here." And we all had something to say equally consoling. Mrs. Carlisle remarked to Mr. Preble that this was a happy circumstance, since it had restored to Mr. Lysander the confidence he formerly had had in his literary capa- cities, and that she doubted whether a much larger sum, gained in an ordinary way, would have given him so much satisfaction as this tribute to his genius. A very sudden change came over the mind of Mr. Preble. It was the first time we had ever seen him appear to enjoy any of the pleasures of life; but it now seemed that ,the happiness of Mr. Lysander had inspired him with a sense of favor from Hea- ven to himself, and moved him with thankfulness. I was surprised at the depth and apparent sincerity of his pleasure. He seemed even to have gained strength, and walked about the garden, no- ticing, and smiling on every thing. It is truly gratifying to see that any thing can raise a smile on a pallid cheek. It was quite dark when Mr. Lysander and Willie returned. Willie immediately untied a silk handkerchief, which he held in his hand, and displayed to our admiring view the pilgrim tankard that came over in the Mayflower. Oh! what joy we had over it. But Mr. Preble wanted to hold it a long time in his hands, and, because he was sick, we let him keep it, although we could not take our eyes from it a moment. Mr. Lysander threw all his money into Mrs. Carlisle's lap, and then sat down by the side of Mr. Preble to tell him a long story about the tankard; how that he and William, Mrs. Carlisle's son, were boys of the same age, and lived together, and that they were allowed to use this tank- ard daily between themselves; that when they went to Harvard 4   74        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, they carned it with them, and it was the admiration and envy of the whole college. "You know," said he, "how fond stu- dents-and, indeed, all literary people-are of the relics of de- parted greatness. And the adventurous great were those who landed on Plymouth Rock. No higher ancestry need be sought for by the sons of Massachusetts,-no higher can be desired. I could not boast, in college, that I was a descendant of one of the Pilgrims; but it was enough for me that I was the bosom friend of William, the name of whose illustrious ancestor, famed in his- tory, is engraven on the bottom of this piece of plate." And he turned it over, so that Mr. Preble, and we all, could read the inscription. "I will tell you," said Mr. Lysander, " what Mrs. Carlisle intended to do with it. She said, that when we became men, and were settled by ourselves, that we should keep it a year, alternately." Here some sorrowful recollection subdued the voice of Mr. Lysander, and he went in sadness to another part of the room. To have doubted that the money which Mr. Lysander had brought into the house was for general use, would have been to deprive him of all the pleasure he expected to derive from it. But as Mrs. Carlisle refused to keep possession of it, he, the next day, parcelled it out, a double portion for her own use; and for himself and the rest of us, he made an equal division. I, for one, should have objected to receiving any share; but Mis. Carlisle, who knew how to manage his peculiar temperament, desired -us to allow him to make whatever appropriations he might think proper. I was altogether surprised at the manner in which Mr. Preble received his portion, knowing that he did not intend to make use of it. He took it, not with expressions of thankfulness, but of gladness; and put it away with an air. of satisfaction that quite' delighted Mr. Lysander, who, although he would sooner suffer than receive aid from others, never esteemed the less those who took fi'om him without the least shadow of thanks. "I like to see," said he, "people receive good gifts with joyfulness of heart, and not pain- themselves, and put the giver to blush, by their efforts to express their gratitude. And their acknowledg- ments, after all, are only proofs, according to their eloquence, of proficiency in the art of begging. Give a cunning street beggar a shilling, or a practised solicitor for popular charities an eagle, and they will, either of them, thank you with such melting fluency, that ten to one but you put your hand-in your pocket and give X,","  * v.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       75 another. Now, if both should act according to the promptings of their feelings, the street beggar would make his tatters fly with cutting capers, in prospect of a carousal at night; and the other would say, 'I am glad of this donation, as it will raise me in the estimation of my employers, on whom I am dependent for the means of my subsistence. But in the first case, such an exhi- bition of the mental workings of the pauper would soon put an end to alms-giving in the streets; and in the second, the avowal of a selfish, though not unworthy consideration, would be whis- pered to the disadvantage of both the petitioner and the cause in which he was engaged." "Your principles," said Mr. Preble, "seem to involve a moral antithesis. You are reconciled to the expediency of practising an art, of which you condemn the theory." "There is," said Mr. Lysander,L "a sort of discrepancy between the necessity and the prudence just exhibited; and, also, in things in general; for do we not, every day, see that it is easier for a man to make himself believe that it is sometimes right to do wrong, than for another to convince him that it is always for his true interest to do right ."   76        CHARACTERS UNVEI ED; ORE, CHA PTER XTII. Lysander dismisses his employer-His benevolent design-Disappointment-A sudden excursion-General regret for the absence of Mr. Lysander. IT was easy to see that Mr. Lysander's capacity for business had not increased with his good fortune; for he went the next morn- ing, after the receipt of his money, and " dismissed his employer," as he informed us; " not forgetting to return the advance pay," which must have left himself almost penniless. But that same day Mr. Preble took him to his chamber, and opened to him the true state of his own affairs, and of his entire independence, in point of wealth; and forced back into his hands the amount he had received in so satisfactory a manner the evening before. Mr. Lysander hid himself during the remainder of the day. As we sat in the twilight shades of the evening, conversing on the recent event, Mr. Lysander suddenly rushed by us, saying, "I forgot!" He ran with great rapidity down the main road, and was soon out of sight. We delayed the tea for fill two hours, in anxious suspense. But he did not return, Mrs. Carlisle grew faint and nervous. "He was always at home in the evening." 'What can have happened?"    "Something terrible has hap- pened!" cried we all. "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" and we ran in and out in wild dismay; Willie crying, as if his little fond heart would die. And Mr. Preble, trembling like an aspen, acknow- ledged to Mrs. Carlisle that he had given him back the money. Oh, dear! this was the worst of all, for now he had surely been robbed and murdered!"We must alarm the neighborhood and have him found!" gasped Mrs. Carlisle. "Let us all go out door and scream /" said Amy. At this moment, Mr. Lysander made his appearance. He was in a violent perspiration, and much exhausted. We crowded round him, but he waved us away with his hand, and said his    : i?,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      " heart was broken. Mrs. Carlisle offered him tea, but he shook his head in silence. She then proposed that he should retire, as he must be overcome from want of sleep. Mr. Preble was of the same opinion, and accompanied him to his room, where he lis- tened to his murmurings until " tired nature's sweet restorer" came to his relief. Mr. Preble then came down, and after walking up and down the room, he turned to Mrs. Carlisle, and said, "Was there ever so pure, so benevolent a soul encased in human form?  "I doubt not," said Mrs. Carlisle, "that Mr. Lysander has been defeated in some kind intention this evening." "He has, indeed," said Mr. Preble; "he went out to divide his money with the old lady that you call Mrs. Wilson. She would not receive a cent of it; but gave him a full measure of wholesome advice,-and from a good motive, as he verily believes. But he cannot digest it; and he calls her an unkind, unfeeling woman, not to take what he offered her: and he says, he knows that she will be the death of him. It was then late, but we entered into a sort of parley with re- gard to the disposition of the money he had given us. Mrs. Car- lisle was of the opinion that we should make some little purchases out of it, just enough to make it appear that we considered it our own; and then to deposit the greater amount in the ' Savings' to his account. But the first part of the plan we found it unnecessary to put in execution, as Mr. Lysander came down the next morning, equipped for a journey. "My dear Lysander," said Mrs. Carlisle, "where are you going?"  "To the Saratoga Springs," he an- swered. "It has been a long time since I have gone any where like a gentleman; and now that the opportunity offers, I go, my dear honored lady. I bid you good bye." We held him fast, begging him to take back a part of the money he had given us. But " not a cent-not a solitary cent!" said he; "and so good morning. I breakfast on the way." And thus he left us, without even a change of linen. Mrs. Carlisle was distressed that he was no better prepared for the excursion, and observed that he had no idea of the expenses incurred at those watering-places; and added, that the amount of money he -had taken with him would be altogether insufficient to furnish him with a decent wardrobe. But Mr. Preble proposed to obviate all difficulty, by opening a correspondence with him; and -by making remittances weekly.   78        CHARACTERS UNVEILEn  ; OR, This argument satisfied us, and 'we recovered our cheerfulness, --all except Willie, who had not been separated from his friend for, eight yearns. He abandoned his books, and lay on Lysander's bed, and wept on Lysander's pillow all that day; and for many days afterwards. "In all his accounts of his wanderings," said Willie, (" he never mentioned his having communicated with his friends; and you may write to him, but your letters will never reach him; for he may not be long at the Springs; and he may suffer fi'om want, and he will not have the means to come home." And the child mourned over the. improvident disposition of 1M. Lysander. We went on with our daily avocations, although the absence of the cheerful Lysander threw a gloom over our little circle, and often made us regret that the discovery of the deposit had been made. But we trusted in God for his safe return, and in the up- rightness of his own heart for his being kept from contaminating influences. His place at table was reserved, and his plate and napkin laid as: usual; and we remembered him in our prayers with fervent supplication. The week following his departure, Mr. Preble addressed to him a letter, directed to Saratoga; and the week after, another; but, according to the prediction of Willie, we received no answer. But we were counselled by Mrs. Carlisle to wait patiently, and to believe that his necessities would soon be on our side, and restore him to his happy home. /           . .

IT was now   in the latter part of August, and  the time was approaching  for the appearance of our expected guest, Mr. Sea- bright; and Mr. Preble proposed that a small addition should be built to the cottage, for his better accommodation; and offered to supply the necessary funds. Mrs. Carlisle took this occasion to speak to him on the subject of the obligation, which she already felt herself to be under, in keeping the gold which he had so kindly put into her hands; but assured him, that in returning it, she would feel her mind more at rest, without any diminution of her esteem  for him; or without considering him any the less as a member of her family.  She   then brought out the puree, and gave it to him, saying, that she had abstracted more than enough to pay for the little she had done for him. He received the money in silence, and   shortly after went to his room;  but, oh! how changed was his whole appearance. I only was present, and  my eyes followed him, as he assisted him- self by taking hold of chairs, as he went toward the staircase. I turned to look at Mrs. Carlisle. Her eye had also been upon him.   Her face was pale, and her features fixed as marble. I bathed her forehead with cologne, and endeavored to reanimate her. As she recovered, her first words were, "Has the sea given up its dead .-0   ! Helen, did you see that troubled look?  My poor, unfotunate-my    long lost William!" "Does he resemble your son?" "Oh! no, no!" she replied; "   and yet no other face but that of William Carlisle ever wore that look." "Sorrow," I replied, "has a mark of its own. He cannot be your son; but do not reject his proffered kindness. His life is   80        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, waning away. He needs your sympathy. Greet him as a son; for whoever he may be, he is worthy of your love; and to allow him a common interest with your' family, will give him freedom of enjoyment in the few comforts which now remain for him on earth." "Go to him," said she; "go tell him that I receive his gift, as a mother would receive aid from an only and beloved child, with confidence and pride." Feeling that I should be the messenger of comfort, I hastened to Mr. Preble, whom I found reading his Bible, which lay on a small table before him.  He did not raise his eyes on my en- trance; but I, begging pardon for the intrusion, took a seat un- asked, saying that I had come with a message fi'om Mrs. Car- lisle. His white lip quivered, and his tears fell on the sacred page. I felt at a loss how to explain the sudden change in Mis. Carlile's mind concerning the money, otherwise than to speak of the sudden emotion, caused by some resemblance, which she had not before observed, to her lost son: and I described the scene which had just passed below. Mr. Preble seemed to manifest much tenderness of feeling for Mrs. Carlisle, .who, as Mr. Lysander had informed him, was devot- edly attached to her son, but who, by an imprudent connection, brought distress on his parent, and ruin on himself; and parted with her under circumstances of alienation on his part, and of the most poignant grief orhers. But no reproach from her separated them,--polluted, or unpolluted, he was still her son. After a momentary pause, he added, "I know of no relative or friend to whom I can bequeath mylittle property;.and now, in view of approaching death, it would give me pleasure to bestow it on Mrs. Carlisle and her family. In my feeble state of health, I stand in need-of kindness, and of the consolations of friendship." "I know," continued he, "that these blessings are not to be bought with gold. I am also convinced, that were I without the means of support, I should here find an asylum; and perhaps a greater degree of confidence in the purity of my character, than I can now command. The son of Mrs. Carlisle could never, in her presence, have felt the desolation which overcame me when I found myself and my mite cast out, not from the hospitalities of Mrs. Carlisle, but from the maternal-like confidence, and union of J: interests, which her own amiability, and my situation as a friend- less invalid, had led me to hope. A mother! what a word to the   : world-forsaken! No man can despair with the eye of a mother  g.,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      81 upon him. The heart of man cannot break, with the hand of a mother upon his head. If any portion of heavenly love rests upon earth, it is found in that one sacred relation." It was now my hour for attending to my duties at the semi- nary, and I bade him " good morning," hoping that every cloud would have passed from our domestic sky, when I should return in the afternoon. I stopped at Mrs. Carlisle's room, as I went down. She was lying on her bed. I related to her the affecting conversation of Mr. Preble, every word; and then hastened to the school. At precisely half past three o'clock, I put on my bonnet, and fuill of anxiety, in consequence ofthe events of the morning, took my walk homeward. I had not proceeded far, when I espied the whole family coming together to meet me.  Mr. Preble and Willie, hand in hand, a little in advance of the others. Willie dropped the hand of his companion, and bounded forward some distance to meet me, saying, in a low tone, as he took my arm, "Dear little tuzen, you never heard the like in all your life." Mr. Preble bowed and kissed his hand, and smiled to me; but his face was of a livid paleness, and contrasted fearfully with the jet black hair, by which it was surrounded. In Mrs. Carlisle there appeared an air of weariness, and subdued energy; yet her eye spoke the language of love, and in the tones of her voice there breathed that melody which comes from a heart at peace with itself. The young people drew me forward to make their communi- cations out of the hearing of Mrs. Carlisle and Mr. Preble, who, either from feebleness, or a desire to prolong their conversation, seemed inclined to Walk very slowly.  "Tuzzenf' said Willie, "Mr. Preble is arich man. I hearid him tell grandmamma, to-day, that he had made his will, and had given every thing to her and her famil= and Mr. Lysander. On] think, tuzzen, he did not for- get Mr. Lysander. Now, I love him for it. And then we are to have an addition built to the cottage, right away,-one room for unole Seabright, and one for Mr. Lysander; Mr. Preble and grand- mamma said so. And, now, when Mr. Preble gets well, and Mr. Lysander gets home, oh! happy we shall be! But, dear tuzzen, if Mr. Preble should die, we would not be willing to keep his money;" and Willie's cheerfulness allforsook him. "I ani much surprised at the making of that will," said Sarah. "I noticed, although I did not speak of it at the time, that the 4-k   82       . CHARACTERS UNV]I!fED; OR, will was dated as far back as last March, and signed and sealed, before we even knew Mr.- Preble. It seems vely strange that our uncle Seabright, who has been absent from the country for more than forty years, could have given him so favorable an account of his sister-our grandmamma,-as to raise in him, at once, so much esteem for her character as to bring him to this country, and to her home; and still more surprising is it that he should make a will in her favor before he saw her." "There is some mystery about it," said Amy, " and mystery, in my opinion, denotes something wrong." "That there is to us an unknown cause for this preference, H do believe," said Sarah; "but that the concealment arises from any thing reprehensible or criminal, I do not believe. From my reading, more than from my observation, I have found that circumstances do sometimes occur, that so nearly touch the repose of innocent persons, that conceal- ment is necessary to their peace of mind. And I would not wish to be in possession of a secret, the revelation of which might en- danger another's happiness." "Dear sister Sarah," said Willie, "I love you, because you talk so like Mr. Lysander. He would run out of the way of a dis- course not intended for him to hear. And he told me that if a man should steal his purse, he would not be willing to have him detected, the poor fellow would feel so bad. It is certainly right for people to respect the privacy of others." "Little Willie," said Amy, "your sympathy has put forth a new shoot. But I, too, must quote Mr. Lysander. He often tells me that I am fond of 'transparencies, moral as well as me- chanical' And so I am, for, ' although,' to use his own words, 'I would not listen behind a door, nor break the seal of a letter to obtain a secret,' yet I do love candor among friends!" "I do not apprehend," said I, "that there is any event in the life of Mr. Preble that may properly be called a secret. I am in- clined to the opinion, once hinted at by Mr. Lysander, that he has been the victim of an unhappy passion; and that his taciturnity, respecting himself, is the consequence. His desire of sympathy and repose, with good and kind people, is a sufficient reason for his wish to remunerate, with all his worldly means, those who nourish and console him. This last is, ever, the reigning impulse of a bruised and broken heart. Mr. Seabright has been a long  time absent, but we must not be too positive, fi'om that circum- stance, that he knows nothing of the character and condition of ,  .                      : a q   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE 'MNDS,      83 Mrs. Carlisle and her family. There are other resources for infor- mation besides letter-writing." "I believe you have given us a dear view of the subject," said Sarah, "for any thing like an intention to deceive, would be incom- patible with the character of so much humility and piety, as we have unmistakable evidence of in Mr. Preble." The others both coincided with the remark of Sarah; and so, with as much satis- faction in our own solution of the mystery, as if Mr. Preble had given us his memoirs, we arrived at the garden gate, and waited for Mrs. Carlisle and Mr. Preble to come up. But seeing that we were waiting, they turned off, as if to hold further conversation, and we entered the house. In the evening we busied ourselves with drawing plans for the intended addition to the cottage. Wilhe was much grieved that Mr. Lysander was not present to give his opinion; but consoled himself with the assurance that one of the rooms to be erected was designed, exclusively, for his use. I asked Mis. Carlisle, as a favor to me, to receive my first quarter's salary to assist in defray- ing the expenses. "And don't forget to make use of M'r. Lysan- der's," said Willie, " for he is one of us, and he will be unhappy if you slight his money."  "Of some portion of Mr. Lysander's money we may make use," said Mrs. Carlisle, " but cousin, here, must have a piano'of her own."  "Of her own earnings?" said Willie. "Who ever heard of a lady earning a piano ." "It will be well for her to have one," replied Mrs. Carlisle. "I do not say that she must earn it all." That evening I brought out my guitar, and strung and tuned it, and played several airs. Wilhe was quite delighted, and all present seemed pleased and gratified. Mr. Preble expressed a fondness for sacred songs, set to pensive music; and Sarah, with the sweetest little voice in the world, sang 'Adeste Fideles' to my accompaniment. After which we made our orisons, and then re- tired to our slumbers. The next morning, when we met at breakfast, I could not but notice the deep shade of sorrow on the brow of Mrs. Carlisle. Notwithstanding, she was social and attentive to all around her. Mr. Preble appeared like a favorite restored, after a misunderstand- ing, respectful,. humble and sorrowful, but cheerful It seemed to me that Mrs. Carlisle, having lost her own son, guarded her heart against the intrusion of another into his place, although that other was every way worthy of her regards; and not only disposed to   84        CHARACTERS tUNVTRIPED ; OR  treat her with the most filial attentions; but bore a striling re- semblance in manner and in sentiment, if not in person, to the son she so deeply deplored. There might be a resemblance in their griefs too. But I suppressed my curiosity, as no one seemed dis- posed to give me information. ,    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       85 CHAPTER XV. Building an addition to the cottage-Sad reflections for past neglect of filial duty-Ar- rival of Mr. Seabright-His appearance-His pleasing manner-His kindness-His principles. THE building was now going on; the autumn was advancing. The young people continued diligent in their studies, instructed by Mrs. Carlisle; and but for the absence of Mr. Lysander, not a cause of immediate sorrow appeared among us. But for me, I had a secret sorrow at my heart. The sudden separation from my father, under an appearance of coldness and resentment on his part; and his neglect of writing to me, filled me with a kind of deadly grief. I felt that I had deserved but little favor from him, not having, in a single instance that I recollected, for many years, sacrificed my own desires, either to his pleasure or his com- fort, although he was, in every way, worthy of my love and ad- miration. But there was no sympathy between us. He was de- voted to study; to the pursuitof knowledge without the neces- sity of applying himself to a profession. Hence his attainments were deep and varied. He was fond of society of his own caste; but never attempted to control me in my choice of associates, or of amusements. It is but too true that he sometimes complained that he should have no more of my company, and was irritated by the too frequent evidence of the fadt, that the presence 6f the veriest fop alive had more charms for me than his own. I cannot tell how it was, that gratitude should have no more influence over me, for I was well aware that my own foibles were tolerated by the over-scrupulous, fi'om  regard to him. And I al- ways felt a pride in calling him " father." An estrangement had been taking place between us for several years; yet there was no unkindness on his part, it was all on my own, and all proceeded from one source-my neglect of him. Sensible of my undutifill- ness, I did not feel at ease in his presence, and contrived to meet   86        CHARACTERS UNVrEDTPD; OR, with him only at dinner, and when I wanted money. Then I was attentive and kind to him. I had not yet lost so much regard for his dignity as to demand money. I still asked for it. One of the few things that I remembered of my dear mother, was hearing her say to my father, one morning, "My dear, if you please, I should like so much money, to-day"-naming a certain sum. I had heard that my mother always treated my father with great atten- tion and respect. And such was his regard for her memory, that he never put another in her place. I now think it very strange, that I should never try to imitate my mother in any thing else, but in her manner of asking for money. One evening, I sat two hours with him in his library, before I made my request. He had really charmed me by his conversation; and in giving me- the amount I asked, and a great deal more, he said, "Any sum, at my disposal, is but a trifling compensation for the pleasure I enjoy in the kind company of my daughter for a few hours."  But the very next evening, he being unwell, and in low spirits, asked me to play and sing a somewhat unfashionable old song. I peremp- torily refused, and after striking up the newest fandango of the day, I went to a party. How deep was now my contrition, and how full, and how sin- cere would have been my confession, could I have but written to  : him. But alas! I knew not where to seek him. I looked around; the autumn fruits had fallen,.and the leaves were scattered from the trees-emblems of mny scattered hopes. But the spring will come, and the trees put forth new leaves; and will there be no spring-time to my heart  Our house was at last finished. Then there was some little   : bustle in furnishing. Mr. Preble had the ordering of the room designed for Mr. Seabright; and Willie superintended the furnish- ing of the one for Mr. Lysander. It was fitted up in the most simple style, but the most trifling article for convenience or com- fort, was not omitted, and all the peculiarities of the "Poor Scho- lar," were remembered in the arrangement of his furniture-even  : to the disposition of the tongs and the poker on the mantelpiece. On the tenth of December, a steamer came in from Liverpool, and, in the list of passengers, we saw the name of Seabright; and hardly had we time to make a word of comment, before he, at- tended by an Iish servant, was announced. The meeting between  him and Mr. Preble was most cordial. But Mrs. Carlisle, to whom :: he was comparatively a stranger, received him with a degree of  : !:   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       87 embarrassment. She was disposed to greet him with the warmth of sisterly affection; but his long absence, and the belief that he had ceased to exist, had broken the tie of fraternal sympathy, and theyv now met more as persons having a mutual regard, than as brother and sister. He, however, congratulated himself on his ret turn to his nearest relative, and Mrs. Carlisle expressed much sat- isfaction in the prospect of his aid in the discharge of her duties to her grandchildren, and in the consolations of a brother's care and protection. Mr. Seabright was many years older than his sister, and his appearance, though strangely antique, was venerable. His hair, eyebrows, and a heavy uncut beard, were white; the hair, a wig, arranged behind in a queue. His face, that portion of it which was not concealed, was fair, though a little sunburnt. He wore a coat after the fashion of the times of George IL, with small- clothes, knee-buckles, and immense buckles in his shoes. Hee cer- tainly had very droll appearance, and, I thought, not altogether prepossessing. But we were easily made to feel the superiority of mind and manner over the exterior covering of the body. In his conversation he was highly interesting, and with all the dignity of a sage, so perfectly winning, as to excite in us a strong desire for his approbation. We soon perceived that Mrs. Carlisle was much pleased with her brother, although she could not treat him with the familiarity of a sister. In' their colloquial powers they were equally happy. I sometimes knew not which most to admire, when they were en- gaged in conversation, his thorough knowledge and clearness of illustration, or her less positive but equally interesting remarks. Amy was rapturous in the praise of her new uncle, whose answers to her questions on the subject of female education, were such as to encourage her desires of mental improvement, and her ambi- tion to elevate the intellectual character of females. And an ar- rangement was soon made, for a profound discussion on the subject of the comparative mental excellence of the two sexes, during the long evenings of winter. The presence of Mr. Seabright was a strong support to the drooping energies of Mr. Preble, over whom he exercised the care and tenderness of a father. If a cloud of sorrow rested on his brow, it was chased away by some kind word, or gentle attempt to change the current of his thoughts. Barney, the Irish servant of Mr. Seabright,-a kind-hearted creature,-was appointed, by   , - - I  8 8        CHARACTERS UN3VEITLD; OR, his own desire, his constant attendant. Still he seemed to have  little pleasure in any thing except in the company and conversa. tion of Mrs. Carlisle. The melancholy, yet pious turn of his thoughts found a congenial sentiment in hers; and the endearing  word " mother" was answered by the consoling appellation "son." Mr. Seabright was not what the world would term an ortho. dox believer. He accounted himself a rational Christian, both in doctrine and in practice. "We will endeavor," said Sarah to her grandmamma, "1 to hold up our religion to him in such a man.  - ner- as to convince him, that there is pleasure in believing in the divinity of our Saviour, as well as in following his precepts." "We will continue on our course," answered Mis. Carlisle, "so that he, may not reject our creed, even if he be not readily convinced of its truth. Belief sometimes comes of practical testimony in its favor."       - But Mr. Seabright was neither believer, unbeliever, nor skeptic, in the full sense of either term. He had some very lofty views of the design of created existence, but contended that although the things made could not comprehend the design of the maker, yet that man, being endowed with a self-examining principle, could understand enough of his own nature to be sensible of a divine   ; light within himself. "I worship God," said he, " though the    i medium  of this divine light, which I take to be an emanation from his own essence, therefore indestructible."  "By the divine light," answered Mrs. Carlisle, "I understand you to signify the 'spirit of truth,' through which, by the help of revelation, I think we are enabled to form some idea of the attri- butes of the Deity, and of our future state of existence." "Without adverting to-the subject of revelation," said Mr. Seabright, "I- have sufficient evidence, from the contemplation of that self-examining principle within me, called mind, to believe that I am, in -part, immortal." "' My dear uncle," said Amy, who had drawn close to his side,  "do you think the mind and the soul one and the same nature of being "  "In studying the human intellect," answered Mr. Seabright, "we meet with a distinction, which necessarily gives rise to the two terms MND and sOUL."                    i- :- "Be so kind said Mr. Preble, "as to define these two terms, :-a/ separately, and ill connection. I do not promise to become a con- By                   X^   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        89 vert to your doctrine; but I have always listened to you with pleasure, and, I may say, never yet without profit." The young people joined in the request; and Mrs. Carlisle, looking round upon them, said, "If your sentiments are such as to leave no prejudice on their open and unsophisticated minds, I, too, shall bq most happy to listen to you." "You may trust me, my sister," said Mr. Seabright, " and be- lieve me that no sentiment is cherished in my heart, inconsistent with the Christian character; and if I have not the same amount of belief as yourself, you will, at least, allow that there is no hete- rodox in the negative." "I beg pardon," said Mrs. Carlisle, "' for the momentary dis- trust. But you were never a parent, consequently never a grand- parent; and, therefore, cannot appreciate my anxiety for these children." "Yet I respect and honor your solicitude," said Mr. Seabright. We drew ourselves up in the attitude of attention, and listened with deep interest to the following short dissertation on the MND, which Mos. Carlisle took down in stenography.   90         CHARACTERS UNVILED; OR,9 CHAPTER XVI.

THE mind.-"The elements," said Mr. Seabright, '.Nwhich con- stitute a rational creature are a heavenly spirit, a clod of earth, and the medium which unites them. This medium, or agent, is of a compound nature.   The part which sustains the connection with earth is called ' life ;' that which is the link of mortality with im- mortality is called ' mind.' Both act with unceasing energy, and when in a healthy state, in concert. The latter inhales emanations from the soul, or spirit, which is the divine relation, while it de- pends on the former as the basis of its existence, and the supporter of its energies. "The mind, from its ethereal connection, is subtile, ingenious, and full of devices; and from its human constitution is changeful in its preferences, sometimes becoming the grovelling pander to the capricious desires of the body, and again moving under the higher influences of the soul. Yet in neither case can it explain how the force was applied which compelled it to obedience. It is    . susceptible of improvement, we believe, beyond all tried experi- ment, yet is incapable of solving the slightest problem relative to its own manner of action,-even in the influence which it exerts over the body.  It ponders, with awe, on its power of putting the  organs of speech into motion; of directing the eye, or command-    ) ing the attention of the ear; of moving, or of restraining the     movements of the limbs: yet these faculties are but gifts for con- venience, designed to facilitate our communion with familiar ob-       THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        91 jects. But how much more is the wonder excited in contemplat- ing those attributes which elevate in our minds the standard of design, and of investigation. The simple act of conveying our thoughts to paper is impelled by an inscrutable influence; and that the minds of others should, by surveying, through the eye, the characters which represent these thoughts, make themselves acquainted with the transactions of persons, separated by land or by sea, perhaps in the solitude of a cell, is proof sufficient of the connection between a heavenly essence and an earthly dross. To write is to speak without a 'voice-to communicate in silence to a silent messenger-to show forth what we term the heart, with- out drawing it from its hidden recess,--communication, by quiet means, of intelligence with intelligence. "There is sublimity, combined with a fearful awe, in the con- templation of the phenomena united in our existence; and in the depth of intellectuality, already sounded, and attested in our works, -works which give evidence that we have never yet made an attempt equal to the powers vested in us. Yet it is certain that there must be a limit to our temporary capacities, and that limit on this side of perfection. It is evident, from the firailty of our mortal natures, that the soul, or immortal part, while connected with earth, can never show its own perfec- L tions, or be estimated according to its true value--but only as the mind may chance to represent it; and since the fidelity of the latter depends upon the peculiarities incident to its earthly organization, and on the influences of health, and other circum- stances connected with its existence, biur opinions of the former are often questionable, and even contradictory. That the mind is, in part, material, is shown from the labor and diligence required to mould it to usefulness. Even the crude material is in some of a better sort; but on the possessor depends the excellence of the workmanship. But even when of the finest texture, and most ex- quisitely wrought, most perfect in finish, it is still incapable of ex- hibiting the divine emanation in all its beauties; and is, at best, liable to accident and injury from the infirmities of the body, An instrument out of tune produces discord and shocks the ear, though the air which passes through it may be as pure as the ether of heaven. So a disordered mind tortures itself, even to that degree which we call insanity. "How happy must be that state of existence, how ardently to be longed for, where the soul is free and uncontrolled, glowing in   92        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, its natural perfections, and breathing perfect harmony; where the workings of' an earthborn mind cease to mar its purity, and 5 where the housing of the body no longer renders its existence doubtful'." A moment of silence ensued, when Mrs. Carlisle said, "I am pleased with your remarks; and although your theory of the mind may be somewhat imaginative, still, I think it not absurd, and if generally received might lead to a preference for that side which leans toward Heaven."'  "What is your opinion, Mr. Preble?" added she. "My mind is feeble," he replied, "and a little perplexed on the subject; but there is comfort in believing that the soul is an emanation from the Deity, and that it will, in the end, be released from an earthborn mind." But the young I people were smiling their approbation, as though they had under- stood every word in the fullest extent of its meaning. - Wilhe was the first to speak. "I only wish," said he, " that Mr. Lysander had been here. Dear Mr. Lysander, how pleased he would have been. But grandmamma has taken it down, so he shall read it." "I like my dear uncle very much," said Amy, going up close to   " his side; "but we are always so cold and distant here. Grand- mamma, since our uncle is an old man, and our own relation, I ,  /: should like to kiss him: it would seem  to make us more ac- quainted; and I do think he deserves a kiss for what he has said ? this evening." Here Sarah interposed, softly saying,'"My dear sister, you know our gaandmamma is a lady of strict propriety, and may not approve such familiarity, even with a relative." "Well," said Amy sorrowfully, and taking hold of the Iappet of . his coat, "I love you, uncle, just as much as if I did kiss you." : Mr. Seabright looked very good-natured.. Mr. Preble smiled one of his half-cheerful smiles. Sarah's countenance exhibited a fear-  falness that the danger was not over. Willie looked first at Amy, ' and then at every body else. iMrs. Carlisle examined with the dclosest attention the stenograph in her hand; and we all felt very silly. After a little further conversation, we began to think it time : to retire; and Mrs. Carlisle asked Mr. Seablight to lead in prayer. i "Sister," said he, "I never cultivated a talent for oral communi- i cation with my Maker. My thoughts incline to him daily. My    f ,       THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      93 heart goes out to him in thankfulness, but my lips are unused to :; }' - give utterance to my aspirations." "Willie, my love," said Mrs. Carlisle, 4"Mr. Preble is too much fatigued;" and Willie kneeled beside the philosopher, whose new views of the union of material with immaterial had filled us with admiration, and made him to feel that prayer brings us nearer to God than the most profound acquaintance with spec- ulative divinity. We separated, with a cool " good night" on the part of Mr. Seabright, and retired to rest. The next day was stormy. A deep snow was falling, through which I must make my way to the seminary. Mr. Seabright sent Barney for a carriage, and took me there; and brought me home in the same way in the evening. I found on my return a fine rosewood piano in the parlor-a gift for me, from  Mr. Seabright. " Do not think," said Amy, " that we are going to be jealous of you, or to think that Uncle Seabright has been partial, for he has given to sister and me, each, the price of your piano in money, to be appropriated as we think proper." "Now, my sweet little tuzzen," said Mr. Seabright, imitating Willie, "play me a tune."       I played an air which had been pleasing to my father in my early days.  He commended my performance, and said, "We-Mrs. Carlisle and myself-have determined that'you shall not go out this winter. The fatigue and exposure will be an injury to your health. If any of your pupils prefer your teaching to that of another, let them come here, and take'their lessons."     I thanked him, and candidly acknowledged that I had begun to feel the exertion too much. "I knew it," said he, "and Mrs. Carlisle was not disposed to allow of it, even for so long a time. But come, cheer up; your task will now be comparatively light.  " And really," continued he, " I do not see the necessity of your having any pupils at all." "I wish, said Willie, "that my sisters could play."  " I shall be most happy to give them instructions," I replied.  "Thank you, dear cousin," said Amy; " but I have neither taste, talent, nor in- clination that way; and my mind-the garden of my hopes, must be so cultured as to bring forth other fruit than trills and shakes; and I am afraid the delicate health of sister Sarah will never allow he- to go through so much practice as it is necessary to make only a tolerable performer."

But to my little way of singing I intend to try the accompaniment of the guitar, whenever cousin feels disposed to give me a few lessons." "I am quite inclined to fear," said Amy, "that music is to take place of the disquisitions we expected on more important subjects; and that in this house, as in almost all others, the male portion will spend the better energies of their minds in truly in- } tellectual improvement; and when the hour of pastime comes, call on the females to amuse them r 1" "Well done, my pretty bas bleu," said Mr. Seabright, stoop- ing and peering into her- face from under his great eyebrows. Willie did not know what Mr. Seabright meant, and fearing that Amy had offended him, began to apologize, saying, "I am sure, my dear uncle, that sister Amy did not mean any thing." "Yes, she did mean something," said Mr. Seabright; ' Amy never speaks without a meaning."  "Well, then, dear uncle," she replied, "let us enter into an immediate arrangement for the .... what shall we call them?-lectures or debates ' "Oh! both," said the uncle, "and conversations in the bargain. I will lecture; Amy  shall debate; and Mrs. Carlisle shall lead in the conversations." "I think," said Mr. Preble, " that it would be proper to call them syllogistical arguments, only substituting the term ' ideas of three,' in place of ' three ideas."         ' One can, hardly imagine how this little pleasantry, coming from the invalid, pleased us all. It was like a smart saying of a precocious child; and interesting, not so much from its piquancy, as for the source from whence it came. Mr. Seabright proposed, that when the studies and labors of the day were over, the first hour after sunset should be given to I music; the next to our evening meal, and immediately after that, until bedtime, to conversation; and all reading, not necessarily connected with the subject appointed for consideration, to be ex- cluded; as belonging to the business part of the day. With this arrangement every one was perfectly satisfied; and Mrs. Carlisle thanked her brother for his judicious method of organizing an intellectual coterie. As we approached the supper-table, Willie, who wanted his uncle to be "one of us," in all things, stood beside him, and raised his eyes to his face, as we -were about to take our seats; and meeting there a look of encouragement, put his little hands toge- t % ,                     .

"Male and female created He them!" began Mr. Seabright. "The HARMONY OF DESIGN, to be deduced from   this circum- stance, must be the subject of our FIRST PARALLEL. "Harmony of design.-The elements of mind are the same in both male and female, but in their conformation they are subject to peculiar and appropriate modifications, so as to assimilate with- out the loss of identity, each imparting to the other, without either lessening its own standard value,-the one receiving re- finement from the contact, without deteriorating from the mascu- line character; the other gaining strength without the loss of femi- nine amiability. Their interests being inseparable, and their united efforts necessary to their Common happiness, nature has wisely assigned to each a marked line of action,--parallel, yet dis- tinct; separate, yet so near as to give mutual assistance,-like the chords of a musical instrument, which, though of unequal capaci- ty, vibrate in sweet harmony. "The relative positions of man and woman, like all other mu- tual-aid relations, show that that which is designed to act in con- cert, is not, though an entire unit, complete or independent in itself, since the accomplishment of the object for which it was in- tended, is made to depend on its associations. Their positions with regard to each other; also show that one cannot occupy- any por- tion of the sphere, limited to the other, without a jar, a collision. It is therefore evident, that the mental difference between the two sexes is such only as is necessary to preserve the harmony which characterizes all the works of our good and wise Creator; while the equality upon which He has placed the man and the woman, in social life, is sufficient for the maintenance of distinct rights and. privileges; and all attempts at deviation, either by abandoning their own provinces and obligations, or by usurping the special prerogatives of each other, only tend to destroy the ra- diations of mutual happiness." "This is all very fair," said Amy, 'and affords no matter for 6   98       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; ORP              argument, as you have drawn the first Parallel with clearness and  impartiality."   "Will you please to show," said I, "if there be any difference in the mental constitution of man and woman, independent of their position as helps to each other" 2 ' There is, I think," said Mr. Seabright, " a radical difference, which I shall endeavor to prove, from my own observations on the adaptation of mind. Andthis will constitute our  SECOND PARAT FTST,  "Adaptation of mnd.--the minds of men are not so nearly  equal, compared with each other, as are those of women, in whom  there is a general mediocrity. Above this mediocrity a few rise to a very high degree, and the number is still less who fall below  it. But it would be difficult to ascertain the exact proportion which these last bear to the whole, since the course of life, and the little responsibility which natite and custom have assigned them, in common with the more favored of their sex, save them from humiliation, by shielding them from exposure.  "Women of a high order of intellect usually attach them- selves to literary pursuits--not so much from choice, as from the knowledge of their physical incapacity for more arduous enter- prise; sothat it is but a single talent, more or less brilliant, that gives any important variety to the feminine character. I do not here refer to their virtues, or their vices, which grow out of circum- stances and associations, with very little dependence on the peculiar organization of their minds. In man, on the contrary, there is such a diversity of genius and inclination, with a corresponding physical adaptation, that we find them fitted for every grade and interstice in the routine of worldly affairs, from the highest point of excellence to the lowest .niche within the range of human Ex- periment; and so wide is their field of action, and so various and distinct their callings, that the mind of every individual is brought out, and stands forth almost as much in relief as the body. "The economy of Providence is admirable in the adaptation of the minds of the sexes to their physical capacities. Had men, with a full consciousness of, all their responsibilities, and with all the demands upon their judgment and their skill,'which they now  contrive so readily to answer,--had they, thus accountable and full of devices, been endowed only with the bodily strength and   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       99 mental courage of woman, they must have given themselves up to repining, and allthe enterprises which have improved, embellished, and rendered the earth a fit and comfortable habitation for its present dainty occupants, would have been lost in embryo. Where our cities now stand, forests might be waving to the winds, and tent-making the highest attainment in the science of architecture. "On the other hand, had the various intellect and mental en- ergies, distributed among men, been conferred on women, they must be miserable from their inability to put their grand schemes into execution; or if, from their most powerful and united efforts, they should achieve something to command admiration, they must suffer from the consequences of neglecting their own per- sonal comfort, and from the disordered state of affairs within their own appropriate sphere. "With these views of our fitness for our respective stations in life, I look upon its cares as being sweetly divided,-to man is given the rugged portion, which brings out his energies, stimulates him to deeds of greatness, and enables him to control the moral destinies of the world,-while to woman is confided those gentler duties, for which Heaven has fitted and designed her." There was a long pause at the conclusion of this Parallel, and Amy looked quite as well satisfied as though a contradiction had been involved. "The adaptation of mind is often sadly marred by prejudices and deviations," said Mrs. Carlisle. "It is true," replied Mr. Seabright, s" but in order to account foi this, it will be necessary to take a view of our individual capa- cities, which will be a subject for the THRD PARATTETLo Individual capacities, deviations, and prejudices.--." Men;' said Mr. Seabright, " in every station of life, are expected to have some knowledge on other subjects than those immediately con- nected with their vocations. So women are required, and, usually, are found to be, in some degree, endowed with talents, which, in the quiet routine of feminine employments, are seldom called into requisition. If it should be said, that God has given no faculties   1UU       CHARACTERS UNVIITED; OR, to lie dormant, I will answer, that none of us, either male or fe- male, fully comprehend the resources of our own minds, and often, on urgent occasions, we are astonished to find ourselves endued with abilities of which we had no previous conception, and which might have lain -concealed to the end of our existence, had they not been brought out by some important necessity. Few persons in the ordinary course of life are called upon to act up to the ex- tent and variety of their capacities. Nature has wisely and kind- ly provided a reserve. Therefore the perfect execution of some commonplace act should not be regarded as the limit of the cleverness of the performer." "I think," said Mrs. Carlisle, "that your last remark is more applicable to females than to males; for were the motives for female enterprise a little more expanded, some new energies or principles might be brought out. But man, always having had full scope for the exercise of his faculties, must, long since, have shown how far he is capable, in the performance of great and meritorious deeds; and in order to bring out a new principle of action in a man of high ate tainments, we must demand a lessening of his dignity, and see whether he can soothe his infant with the skill of a nurse; or, in case of emergency, make his own tea with the tact of a housewife." Mr. Seabright smiled at what he evidently regarded as a fee- ble argument, and said, "There are occasions, as you have already premised, which call for a lessening of dignity. They, therefore, cannot be expected to bring out a new principle of action." To which Mrs. Carlisle replied, "To meet a demand upon his kind offices with an amiable compliance, or to serve himself in case of need, without murmuring, does bring out in a proud man a new principle of action, a spirit of kind condescension, which adds lustre to his character." Mr. Seabright, who seemed to be a little nettled at the prompt refutation of his last remark, answered, "Truly, my dear sister, you will find it easier for a man to make himself more pleasing, by acts of humiliation, than for a woman to profit from the indul- gence of high and generous aspirations." Mrs. Carlisle answered with mildness and dignity, "I have placed man in the capacity of nurse, etc., partly to show that he may, with propriety, act as occasion or inclination requires, in mat- ters of trifling import, and by way of illustration of the vast dis- tance between him and ourselves in popular usefulness. I have no desire to bring him down from his own element, for I well know   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     101 that our entire dependence for comfort and happiness is on the tenacity with which MEN] ho-nor and support the masculine charac- ter; and that any important deviation therefrom, is disastrous to the well-being of some portion of the community. Female influ- ence is, therefore, vey naturally exerted in the cause of male   aggrandizement. "And it shows their wisdom' and good policy;" said Mr. ea- bnight, " for when a man .ises, his family are found in the scale with him: whereas, it would be difficult for a woman, who is so foitu- nate as to obtain an elevated position for herself, to bring her hus band to the same standard; or what is more desirable, so to raise him, in public estimation, that his shadow may fall, like a brilliant halo, around her own head." there ou will, however, acknowledge," said Mrs. Carlisle, "that there is often an exuberance of mind, or an impulsve desire  fame, which brings much of the mental ardor and intellectual en- joyment of the other sex into the pastime of women; and on pro- pensities of this sort no estriction should be laid, as a common inter- est and reciprocal aid in the improveent of the  mid are strong ientives t mutual respect and confidence.  And as there are oftener exigencies, in the different grades of society, which mae it necessary for women to a't out of their owni mmediate sphere  than for men to assume an y of the feminine duties it would seem that the minds of the former should be doubly prepared for emer- gencies. And, indeed, even with their few advanta ges, they are geneally, so prepared that the demands on their extra-exertions are met with cheerfulness and self-pOssession  and when called out to contend with the world, or to aid in ging happiness to their fellow-creatures, every impulse which would lead to shrink task is subdued, while, with the refined and meritorious, a conscious and feminine delicacy is retained. "Women,   wh o have been called through the workings of providence into public life, have, even in their political capacities ee. found quite on an average with men.  This truth i sfi- iently manifest from the prospenrit y of nations under the reigning eens of Euope.  Yet I don't go so far as to say that nature did design women for the duties a nd responsibilities of public life. My reasons for thinkin g that such was not the case, I fid in th e weakness and'unfitness of my own person." "I am glad to hear you speak th us," said MA : Seabright, " and thank you   for opening the wa y for me to expre ss my sentiments   O2       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR,  Mfieely on a subject of great delicacy. it is evident, from the con- stitutional dependence, and I m ay say th e lov e of d ependence, in women, and from the want of that almost unvarying state  of health and strength, hich   enable men to decide unhesitatin gly, and to ac m t n ess i thrat they were not designed for the perform - act with profficial duties. ry r  onsible situation has not, like that of a queen, a halanx of intellect attached to its service The co   urse of management must, usually, be conducted through the convictions of one alone; and no deputy canbe ehargeable with the issue.

Those of the male, supposing themselves to be the most favored portion of the human family, become arrogant despising all pretensions less boastful than their own and make comparisons not very flattering to the other sex. This causes some females, quite as radical as themselves, to feel, individually and collectively, insult- ed; and to look upon it as al incumbent duty, binding o U who can speak in meetings, or write a paragraph, to resentthe in- dignity, in the name, andfor the benefit of the whole female world. Thence come very moing dissertations on the Rights of "I have never yet found;' said Mrs. Carlisle, "that women    THE?  ?LEASURES OF PURE MNDS.    103 were more resentfal or vindictive than men; for the latter cannot bear, with any degree of equanimity, a meanness, or an inconsider- ableness, imposed on them by other men, or by women; while both sexes usually submit, without noise or passion, to any dispen- sation, however uncongenial to their comfort or their pride, when they view it as an act of Providence. Men are not dissatisfied willth themselves, because they have not the delicacy and beauty of women; and women are not unhappy because they are smaller and weaker than men. But there is a class of little minds,-call them radicals,' if you please,-things of fourth or fifth-rate intel- lect, who, having acquired a little scholarship, look on every men- tal attainment of women as a lessening of their own importance; and through fear of being eclipsed by secondary bodies, treat all female pretensions with contempt. This would not be worth our notice (for men of higher grade, those from whom we expect light and instruction, have no such fear of competition), were it not that some sensitive women take the matter very seriously; and seem to groan under an injury, from which there is no escape. They fancy they are accused of an inferiority, which is but the result of their unfavorable position in society; and their minds have been I overlooked and left to waste- while those of the more fortunate sex, having been appreciated, had been cultivated, and advanced to a distinction, from which they, the neglected, but equally de- serving portion of the human family, must suffer by ignoble com- parison.  "There is yet another class of your radicals,-men, whom, for some cause which I cannot well define, women can neither love nor esteem; and these unfortunate gentlemen, generally, possessing a tolerable share of intellect, and immense vanity, in endeavoring to make it appear that there is a sympathy between themselves and the female community, are constantly descanting on the disadvan- tages of being a woman; and, in every paroxysm of feeling, attune their souls to pity, as though He, 'who doeth all things well,] had made an exception of one half of the better portion of his works. And some women, being radical in their credulity, take up the same opinion, notwithstanding their well-contested arguments in favor of their own dignity."  Mr. Seabright added, in a sort of undertone, Tales daba gracias a' los Dioces por haber nacido hombre y no muger.'"Tales P" said Mrs. Carlisle, " tenia mal idea de las mugeres?" Mr. Seabright, who was quite sure that he had a sweet morsel  104       CHARACTERS UNVIT LF.; OR, of a stolen idea all to himself, looked a little mortified when he was detected in the enjoyment; and was about to make some     I i further remark, when Amy left her seat with an airi which seemed I to indicate that she thought the conversation was not general; and he made an apology, in plain English. "It is evident, to me," said Mrs. Carlisle, " that there is some defect in our present system of education, which brings undeserved scandal on our mental endowments; and we shall be happy to lis- ten to your opinions on this subject to-morrow evening. You see that I have, in common with my sex, the spirit of contradiction.  But this being a privilege with us, I hope you will, in courtesy, possess yourself of a moderate share of forbearance for the next occasion, which will be liable to involve some controversy." "I have not," said Mr. Seabright, "been accustomed to'argue with ladies on subjects of importance in any other way than by parrying assertion with satire. But I will take heed, in our future conversations, that it is MRS. CARLISLE, with whom I am speaking; and you will allow me, as a brother, to say, with whom I am proud to hold an argument, on a subject which seems to confound the wise of the present generation." Mr. Seabright had, by this concession, won the -favor of all the listeners, including Mr. Preble, who had regarded the remarks of Mrs. Carlisle with evident partiality and satisfaction. It was now late, and we prepared to separate for the night; but not until after having chosen the subject of " training the  I inind" for the FOURTH PARALLEL. The next day Mr. Seabright and Mrs. Carlisle were shut up in their own separate rooms,-adjusting the toilet of their minds, I I should think, from the precise and circumspect manner in which they opened the conversation of the evening, each offering prece- dence to the other. But the gallantry of Mr. Seabright overcame the modest good-breeding of Mrs. Carlisle; and she, after saying I that she foresaw that, on many points, they should not be able to  agree, until the one was convinced by the other, she wished her brother to treat her arguments with the same critical severity that he would were his opponent a gentleman,-made the remarks which immediately follow: Training the mind.-"If there be any difference between the   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      105 male and female portions of community, which brings reproach to the latter, it arises, not so much from natural or theoretical, as from practical causes. That this is the case, should be apparent to every observer; and the abuse and the remedy may both be found by analyzing the present process of education, which I shall attempt, after a few remarks on the disadvantages of a dissimilar mode of instructing the young. "In order to equalize the benefits arising from schools, males and females should, during their scholastic years, receive an equal amount of instruction and encouragement. Yet it is evident that in those branches of learning which qualify their possessors for public concerns, an excess should be given to those on whom pub- lie responsibilities are most likely to devolve. While, to the other paiy, some exclusive advantages should be awarded, to prepare them for the more retired social duties and enjoyments; and here great care should be taken to counteract the prevailing elnor of setting too high a value on accomplishments, which have little or no place in the education of men. The attainment of a very high degree of perfection inthe ornamental branches of a lady's edu- cation, is certainly to be desired. It is the sentiment that these embellishments are irresistible, to whiol I object. Young  men begin very early to lay the foundation of a fit- ness for political life,-the learned professions,-mercantile trans- actions,-and a  variety of other pursuits; and of each and all of these no educated woman should be found entirely ignorant, al- though none of them fall within the compass of her own system of education, and cannot be- pursued with a professional bearing. But all knowledge is the result of professional labors; and a phy- siological acquaintance with the phenomena of nature; a compre- -hensive view of the resources from which human means are drawn; clear perceptions of the importance of the arts and sciences; of the science of government; of the nature and tendency of the different departments of literature, &c., &c. These form the ele- ments of what we should term education: of which the questions and answers inthe text-books, at school, are only the beginning but which, having passed through, the female is said to have finished her education; whereas, a  continual course of improve- ment, on this foundation should be kept up, and expected in the female as well as in the male citizen; for in the every-day inter- courseof life, we cannot avoid mutual interchanges of sentiment on popular subjects; and these can only be well-timed 'and    106       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, agreeable, where the parties, from habits of reading, observation, reflection and conversation, have equal confidence in forming and  in expressing their opinions.  n I theink, y dear sister," said Mr. Seabright, " that there is, in the minds of females, generally, an elemental distaste or study;  otherwise they would enter, of their own accord, ito the ields of science, which are open to all; butinto which none are compelled  further than the couse of the 'text-book' wich. is but the gate of entrance. Yet who can deny that in those families, where the benefits of education have been equally dispensed, the women are [ not so generally well informed as the men,-even on those sub- i jesrs of which they made study at school, and which we dail discussed in their presence. But as you have treated this matter  of defect in female education with more gentleness of temper, and  less crimination of us, than I ever expected from a lady, Jealous of the reputation of her sex, you will, I trust, excuse me if, in- stead of a direct answer to your very accurate and comprehen- sire remarks, I take up the prevailing error, which brands us with the crime of oppression.  "It is a truth that we can improve only in proportion to the pains we take; and until women are willing to labor as men do,  in the cultivation of their minds, they cannot expect to be their  quas, -even in those -departments of knowledge wherein it is a shame for them not to be thoroughly conversant. Nor can it be  supposed that men, who have foregone the comforts of sleep, the cravings of hunger, the pleasures of society, and often the neces-  sary attentions to declining health, should come forward and say,  ' Truly, the amount of mind in us, woho have nzot spared ourselves  in its imrwprovefet, is no greater than in, those females who have W given their time to the comfort of their persons, and to idle specu-  lationsconcerning the issue of their attractions.'  "If the minds of women are, by nature, equal,--or superiol i as the above acknowledgment would intimate, to ours; yet, after  abusing their opportunities for improvement, they are found of in-  ferior qualityi--why, then, there is the less excuse for them. A mind that is infirm should be soothed and encouraged; but one t  hat has gone to waste through self-neglect, should not cry,'pre-  judice!' Men cannot be divested of their discriminating charac- ter; and self-love will always incline them to estimate their own  worth at its full, intrinsic value. They do not mean to be unjust,    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      107 however, and are willing to rate the character of others at its-ap- parent value. "My worthy monitor,' said Mrs. Carlisle, "I am coming out of the consternation in which your high-toned eloquence had well nigh overwhelmed me, an entire convert to your opinions. But as an apology for my sex, in general, I must assert that there are pre- judices, against which it is hard to contend, even in this enlight- ened age; and which operate as a paralysis on the most gifted minds. Females of the best talents are too apt to be over-circum- spect and sensitive, knowing that custom attaches a sort of impro- priety to any effort they can make for improvement, other than for domestic duties, or for embellishment, or coquetish attraction. And they regard the pleasures of scientific research, and the ex- pression of sentiment and opinion, on our grand schemes of com- merce, internal improvement, and legislative decrees, as belonging exclusively to the male department, and only allowed to women, in certain stations of life, as honorary privileges. "The mind of man is encouraged to soar. It gets on the wing, and the shouts of the multitude facilitate its flight. But if woman attempt to rise, she is, almost invariably, brought down by the fear, and sometimes by the hiss of derision. Yet I have never supposed that it was by agreement, on the part cf men, that wo- men are liable to these humiliations. I rather imagine, that the more bold and enterprising are inclined to overstep the bounds of propriety,--a narrow propriety, it is true, but affording scope for the full exercise of our bodily and mental faculties,--the latter im- proved to their utmost capacity by cultivation. We do not re- quire so wide a field as man; but ours being the centre of the great circle, and the province of repose, should be cultured with more circumspection, more divested of noxious weeds,-a garden without a bramble,-a paradise in our keeping; and all the talents, all the energies, of the most distinguished of our sex, should be brought to bear upon the one grand scheme of making our own dominion perfect. "But, although we have a natural love of each others appro- bation, and a strong desire to maintain an exclusive reputation, yet we fail in that union of interest which would incline our most talented and ambitious to become 'keepers at homed  It is well known that ladies, whose love-of literary pursuits is too strong to be controlled by ordinary means of opposition, either go over to the other sex for sympathy and support, or immure themselves, and !'t .'  108       CHARACTERS UNVRTLED; OBR, live without congenial society. In point of comfort, the last is preferable to the first, since women, from attaching themselves to the society of men, lose so much of their original character, as to cut off the common sympathies, which give freedom and ease to their intercourse with each other. "This violation of the laws of sympathy is a matter of regret, even with those of meaner intellect; and could we but bring our- selves to appreciate and encourage such talents, as a fair propor- tion of our number possess, then would our approbation be a suffi- cient support in an effort at mental independence and decision of character in the fields of learning, as well as in the color of a hat, or the fit of a bodice. And such, I doubt not, will be the case when we become wise enough to be our own teachers, and to choose arbiters from among ourselves, to decide upon our intellectual, as we do upon our moral worth." "Without the vanity of pretending to aid you in your re- marks, my dear Mrs. Carlisle," said Mr. Seabright, "I would ac- knowledge that they have recalled to my mind similar ideas on one subject, which, but for the pleasure of having listened to you this evening, might never have assumed the form of expression, although, in my own mind, I have attached to them  a certain amount of character. I have often marvelled at the unanimity with which the most absurd fashions are adopted, by the ladies, and, by common consent, carried out against all masculine .opposi- tion. Their councils, in the courts of fashion, admit of no appeal to higher authorities. And never having allowed of any inter- ference,which might control their decisions in matters of adorn- ment for the body, they have gained an ascendant, in compelling the taste of the more staid sex to bow to their caprices; and they now find it easy to make even the ludicrous appear becom- ing, by forcing it into public favor. But why should their confed- eracy be disorganized, and their originality of invention be laid aside, after the fruition of a single-I may almost say, an un- worthy triumph.  They might. in the same spirit of unanimity, establish themselves in the right of bringing out, supporting and defending, a mental independence. But as, from generation to generation, from century to century, it has been the ambition to be admired for the outward appearance, it is felt to be more safe, and more equalizing to the importance of the wise and the unwise, to continue in the fashion-inventing, popular course, than to unite in new views, which have the appearance of requiring additional    TIIE PURE PLEASURES Or PURE MNDS.     109  labors; and which, it is feared, in the end, would biing about a more formidable rival interest than that of costume. "I have oft  en beenamused, when in company with my female friends, to see with what tact all literary conversation is avoidedas though learning were something to be attained for the purpose of being hidden. It may be argued that it is not neces- sary for ladies to keep their science upon their tongues; for if it does not display itself in words, it gives character to the counte- nance, and to the manner of giving and receiving attentions. This may be true to some extent; but were the riches of the mind actu- ally visible through the face, yet suffered to lie inactive, they could only be admired as useless treasures,-like jewels, destined to remain in a strong-box, and only to be seen through a glass in the top. The regrets with which the first part of the conversation of this evening had filled our minds, were dissipated by the amusing stricture of Mr. Seabright, on our independence in matters of dress ng I wonder uncle," said Amy, " how it happened that you, a bachelor gentleman, should notice, with so much interest, the affairs of the ladies, and how you could have gathered so many ideas concerning their peculiarities."  "I have lived a  long time, my dear," answered Mr. Seabright, and never a day has passed without some observation on your sex. It was then proposed by Sarah, that female education should be the theme of the next conversation, as  she had ever y reason to apprehend, front the remarks she had listened to, that the secret of the abuse and the remedy would both be found under that head.  But thls motion was overruled by Amy, whose views ex- tended somewhat beyond the "narrow propriety" system  and she, as we were now on the subject, desired to settle the question of privileges. It was, therefore, decided, that "privileges" should be the subject of the, FIFTH PARALLEL. Privileges.--"You will not dissent from me," said Mr. Sea- bright, when I  say that it is not uncommon for the mind s in  al- lowing itself to brood over either real or fancied indignities, to be- come fruitful in false notions of privileges since you have evidence Of the fact in the feale nateitons w hich are now rife in this middle of the nineteenth century. These agitations are the result ,10      CHARACTERS UNVFILTn; OR, ,f the united efforts of a few men and many women, who are, loubtless, moved by the best intentions. They are, neveheless, njurious (and he bowed down a fiown from the face of Amy),  perhaps only incidentally injurious, and their effect limited to that lass of females who are prone to neglect their duties to look aer their prerogatives; and such seek every opportunity of being instructed, and, in their turn, of givin instruction in the belief-- not so much that theyare oppressed, as that some impotant bene- fits are withheld from them; and, in consequence, much is said about the rights of women. I am sometimes both amazed and amused in seeing these portentous show-bills, labelled 'Rights of Women' 'Wrongs of Women,' etc., at the doors and windows of the booksellers while the young I adies are thronging the sidew dressed out like birds of paradise, smiling in the consciousness of everyindulgene, and tripping as daintilv as though the gods had  prepared the earth for their especial footing. And the matrons--  they move along, looking as comfortable as the means of their husbands can make them. Yet when watching the female coun-  tenance, on such occasions, I have observed that every one-from the school girl in pantalettes, scarcely weaned from her dolls and  her candy, to the spectacled dame of threescore years and ten, the safety of whose every step as a matter of consequence to some attentive male friend-turned the eye from these glaring cap-  itals,with a flit of resentment, which seemed to imply that they  felt themselves, en masse, the victims of outrage and wrong. And now, my dear Mrs. Carlisle, please show forth the cause, if there  be any, of the complaint. 7J' "The peculiar manifestation of which you have just spoken'" replied Mrs. Carlisle, " arises, no doubt, from that which you term  ' false notions of privileges, but I hope that Ishall not be account-  ed one of the disaffected, when I assure you that I am not at all onservative in the matter of reform. But I am no advocatefor social anarchy, and would not desire to have conceded every point demanded in our ' Woman's Right Conventions.' The most that can be done for us, is to make some slight alterations in ourmodern Leviticucs; we must do the rest for ourselves, beginning with a proper appreciation of our own mental and moral capacities, and  aimrg, as I have already intimated, at a more exalted domestic influence; and although we cannot aspire to independence, yet we  should not assume an inferiority because we are not the front in  action. The left hand is the counterpart of the right, but, being ;   THE PURE  PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.   1ll the weaker of the two, it is the favored member. Yet it is equally suited to its purposes, and is generally of greater beauty than the other." - Your comparison," said Mr. Seablight, "gives rise to a some- what ludicrous idea. Put the left hand into the light-hand glove, and you have a woman in the Senate'. "' I am," said Mr. Preble, as much amused with the aptness of the remark, as with the awkwardness of the appropriation." We might all have said the same, but feeling that there might be a little of ill-nature in the metaphor, we should have, suppressed any appearance of mirth,.had not Willie dexterously thrust his left hand into the habiliment of its fellow, and holding it up to view, cried, '  A woman in the Senate!" Mr. Seabright, after having begged pardon of his sister for the interruption he had occasioned, asked of her a candid confession of her opinions in regard to the general conduct of men toward the other sex. "I was," said Mrs. Carlisle, "when I so unwittingly provoked your merriment, about to acknowledge, that I had never discov- ered in men a disposition to render our lives unhappy. On the contrary, I am inclined to think that, although liable to the abuses practised indiscriminately by the vicious in society, we are the privileged portion of humanity. 'For myself, I can say that I have met with kindness and forbearance, where a man, however deserv- ing, would have found no sympathy.; and it must not be supposed that we, who have grateful hearts, make no return of thankfulness to those who provide for us and for our helpless offspring, without accusing us of our weakness, or regarding  us as incumbrances. Neither are we all possessed of the ambition to usurp responsibil- ities which we should find hard to manage, without asking of our male friends not only protection, but assistance equivalent to the entire labor." Mr. Seabright, after thanking Mrs. Carlisle for the good feeling with which she had spoken of the efforts of his own sex in pro- moting the happiness of those who, he politely said, were never too much dependent upon them, made the following remarks: "The female department in the concerns of life, is a well de- fined, and not an inferior one; yet the frequent and silly imputa- tion of inferiority, or of incompetency for the achievements of the other sex,--or, perhaps, oftener from freaks of fancy, some wildly ambitious females think themselves entitled to a less limited sphere   "2       CHARACTERS UNVVEIEI.; OR, of action. They desire, not so much to become more useful, as to show what they are capable of performing. Yet even these, in their little exploits, throw themselves on the natural privilege of women-that of asking assistance. And were their minds so ex- panded, and their desires so enlarged, as to lead to an attempt which might be expected to cover the actors with renown, they would appeal to the male community to remove from before them all the impediments over which men risk their own safety, and to clear the path through which men dash fearlessly, encountering thorns and contending with adversaries, until, scarified and bruised,. they arrive at the desired haven of distinction. We certainly find it difficult to reconcile 'the ambition of some eccentric ladies with their acknowledged helplessness. "I was once," continued Mr. Seabright, "acquainted with a most lovely young orphan girl, who was completely infatuated by her attendance on ' Woman's Rights,' and other lectures of a sim- ilar stamp. I allowed her free access to my library, and one day she came skipping in, exclaiming, 'I do wish I'd been a man. I had rather, a thousand times, be a man than a woman.' ' Why? said I, 'what has happened to make you fall out with your own dear self? 'Why, nothing at ally, said she, puckering her mouth, and twisting her little white shoulder quite out of her dress. 'But men do have so many privileges.' I replied,' You would like their privileges then? ' 'Yes, I should,' said she. bAnd would you like their cares, also 2 I asked. 'Oh! no!' she answered. ' I did not mean that I should like to attend to their business, and be troubled about paying heavy bills. But I do think I could show more talent than some of them, if  here she hesitated, and I asked her, 'if she was serious? and if she would like to make a speech?' 'Yes, I am serious,' said she, 'and I would like to make a speech.' I Well,' said I, ' you would make a very pret- ty speaker, and would command the attention of an audience. Suppose you " take the stump" at the approach of another election. Your popularity might cause those proud men to " hide their di- minished heads." 'I have no doubt,' she replied,' that they would "hide their heads," but it would be to " laugh in their sleeves." The provoking creatures!' And with a great pout on her pretty lip, she walked out with an air, which plainly said,' I am ill-used, I know lam.' UThis lady aspirant was sensible above mediocrity, amiable and accomplished; and I have no doubt but that she could have   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      113 written a discourse, which, for good sense and accuracy, would have compared favorably with some that receive applause. But were those who have good sense and education confirmed in the 'privilege,' as they term it, to preach, lecture and agitate, the whole system of female agency would be liable to be carried out; and the poor, uneducated, unprotected woman be compelled to pave streets, clean sewers, build wharves, drive an omnibus, and be enrolled in the fire department." Amy, who seemed to have heard enough of the '"prerogative," confessed that she saw nothing objectionable in her uncle Sea- bright's views; and we parted for the night, in mutual good hu- mor, having first determined on social intercourse as a subject for the SIXTH PARALLEL. Social intercourse.--  It is not true," said Mr. Seabright, 'that women, have less time for study than men. Generally speaking, they have more, with a wider range of choice in reading; but as they are not expected to exhibit in public, they too often think they must be educated with a view to shine for their own benefit, rather than to converse for the amusement and instruction of oth- els; and under this bias of the'judgment, they neglect the pur- suit of knowledge, after leaving school,-its apparent uselessness giving them  a dislike to any thing like mental labor. If, as it sometimes happens, a lady will continue to study, will learn, she must expect to become an isolated creature. She feels herself to be in an unnatural position; and mixes with society as little as possible, especially the society of her own sex,--otherwise her life would be a continued warfare with the tastes and habits of others, "A well-educated Germany lady, who was also a good Eng- lish scholar, once said to me, 'For what purpose should I continue to study? That I might cogitate alone   . Now, if I should pos- sess a very great share of erudition, I might be annoyed by the frivolous literature of my own sex, who seldom  appreciate any thing higher than a love-tale or a song. And if I seek the society of the other, I might often be obliged to listen when I could wish to speak.' She laughed with great good-humol; and added: 'There is one literature for the gentlemen, and another for the ladies; and as gentlemen are not liable to fall into the mistake of addressing the wrong conversation to a lady, I do not think it necessary to be prepared for such an occurrence? "This gentle lady was not aware how  sensible she was, nor   "4       CHAACTERS UNVJTT; OR, iO how much philosophy she was practising. She was, altogether, unpretending, both in sentiment and in manner; and I must own that she was not the less amiable for being so, as a different view of herself might have disturbed a serenity, which, when united to good sense, possesses an irresistible charm." "She must have been a lovely woman!" said Mr. Preble.    ! "She was so, indeed," answered Mr. Seabright. '"But all sensible women are not so happily constituted as was your amiable German friend," said Mrs. Carlisle. "I was once, in  my youthful days, spending a few weeks with a friend in Georgia, in a neighborhood where a Collegiate Institute had been recently established. My friend was a woman of fine talents, and supefror education; but her husband was a very unlearned man. He was, however, wealthy, hospitable, and good-natured, and much esteemed in the community. Professor W., of the new institution, came to pass an evening at his house; and I being a little curious to learn as much as possible of the character of myfriend's husband, took up a piece of embroidery, risolving to work at it with so much diligence as to preclude any attempt to draw me into con- eensation. But I soon found that there was no necessity for setting myself aside, as Professor W. did not seem to be incumbered with 'literature for the ladies. He placed himself between the really worthy husband and the really sensible wife; and with all due deference to them, as man and wife, he made an attempt to be equally agreeable to both,--his object in this visit being, evidently, to gain popularity for the institution through the heads of families. : He began by discoursing most learnedly, to the husband. But,  A suddenly, as if aware of the presence of the mistress of the house, he turned to the lady and said, 'This is fine weather for the   ladies.' Very fine, sir,' returned my friend. And, with an air of decided satisfaction, he was again pouring his metaphysics into the ear on the other side. His remarks were really interesting; and the attention which was manifested by the wife he mistook for an appeal to his notice; and his attempts to be agreeable were, sometimes, excessively odd. Once he said to her,' Have you seen the latest fashion-plate?' To which the lady replied,' In our re- tired way of living we take but little intjrest in the changes of ,; fashion.' And again, either to allow the husband time to digest, or because he fancied he had hit upon an idea that must, at once, ingratiate himself into the favor of his hostess, he said, with a most approving smile, 'Your children must be exceedingly well-    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       115 managed in order to keep them so quiet. I have not heard one of them cry this evening; and, doubtless, your talent for governing must be of a very superior order.' 'I do the best I can,' returned the be- flattered mother, 'but the nursery is in a remote part of the house; and the children are generally asleep at an early hour.' The Professor bowed, and smiled with perfect content; and re- sumed, with renewed animation, his discourse with, or rather at her good man. The lady could have conversed well, but did not like to appear assuming in the eye of her husband's visitor. Professor W. went away much pleased with his visit, having, as he thought, astounded the husband with a show of so much learning; .and gained the good-will of the wife by so much atten- tion. "After his departure the husband breathed more freely; and said to his wife, ' This has, indeed, been ' afeast of the season and aflow of the bowl,' as St. Paul the evangelist said. And I was pleased to see that, engaged as we were in a learned discourse, the Professor did not forget the respect due to my wife. You must certainly, my dear, have been pleased with his attentions.' Madam smiled, sarcastically, and haughtily replied, ' I was quite lifted up by his condescension.  He then turned to me and said, 'I am very sorry you did not listen to our conversation this evening; you could have done so with pelrfect propriety. '" We all laughed at such a silly man, and Mr. Seabright laugh- ed as much as any of us; but when we were again ready to give attention, he closed the Parallel with the following inference: "Ludicrous as such scenes must appear, they admit of one pleasing consideration, which is, that a man highly gifted by na- ture, or illustrious for his acquirements, discourses with his fellow- man, however untalented or unlearned, without manifesting a sense of his own )superiority, so as to make the other an unwilling lis- tener. And the man of limited capacity, perhaps illiterate, attends, without envy, to the 'eloquence of the more favored by nature, or more improved by art. Indeed, he indulges in a swell of pride, and fancies himself exalted by the exalted sentiments poured into his passive ear. Men are inclined to the belief that- the worth of individuals is a sort of common stock, which, confided to the keep- ing of the few, is nevertheless a treasure for the general benefit. While the peculiar inconsistency of women is the aim  at exclu- siveness, with a desire for a monopoly of esteem. They do not sufficiently realize that their distinctness as a whole,is not ob-   ; 116      CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, literated by the shining qualities of a few; nor do they always ex- ercise that forbearance with regard to each other's blemishes, which should save their general character from too severe a scru- tiny. In their over-fastidiousness thev expose each others infir- mities, and make themselves appear altogether more faulty than they, in reality, are. While a reverse procedure on the part. of men, serves to neutralize their general defects; and prevents the 'bad reputation, or the imbecility of the few, from deteriorating that of the aggregate. It is the good-fellowship of men which settles the question of their superiority and wisdom; and induces women to place more confidence in them than in each other." We felt the justice of these remarks and made no answer. 4" Here you have come at a direct schism between the male sand the female character,"  said Mr. Preble.  "A  demonstration which almost makes one or the other of the lines laid down in the two first Parallels, fly off at a tangent." This little sally relieved us from  our momentary embarrass- ment; and Mr. Seabright proposed that " the difference" should be the subject of the SEAVENTH PARALLEL. The difference.-"l It is the prospect of utility," said Mr. Sea- bright, " that induces enterprise. And at an early period it was discovered that men were to be governed by mind; and that the mind was susceptible of a very high degree of improvement. And in order to afford facilities for its advancement in strength and capacity, schools were founded.   The first experiments proved successful; and the importance which an educated man acquired over an uneducated one, was sufficient to keep up a spirit of emu- lation, which carried   improvement in its onward course; while the various uses to which learning might be applied were brought into review; and studies suited to every demand were embraced in the grand design. Thus has the scheme for the education of men become perfectly systematic; and education is now the basis of almost all the distinctions in our moral and social charae- ter. "But to the question, 'what is Female Education?' I can-    Anot give an answer satisfactory even to my own mind, since the object, the end, or the aim, is seldom thought of, much less de. fined. We all, however, know that it is something which makes a great deal of noise in the world, costs a great deal of money, but, apparently, does little good, except to cover a negative. Yet, even thusit is not without its influences; and little as it appeals to benefit society it cannot be dispensed with. Defective, and al- most without arrangement, it is still invaluable, not only for the discipline it affords to the female mind, but because that among its inconguruities may be found a germ of all that constitutes an education. "Since the responsibility of maintenance and protection falls on man, the education of woman is rather influential than hucra- tire or defensive;   Yet it must not be inferred fiom  this, that she should be restricted in the means of improvement, or limited in her resources for happiness. Nature itself has formed her for a quiet sphere; and the care and tenderness of man has placed her in a   situation less exposed, and comparatively fiee from  the cares and temptations to which he is from  necessity liable.  Therefore the process of her instruction, while it should be such as to store her mind with useful knowledge, and strengthen it to meet the emergencies of life, should rather be such as to foster the natural spark of effeminacy and reserve, than to increase any propensity for the - grosser pleasures, or defiance of the opinions of the world. To be thus instructed, thus formed, will deprive her of none of the 'prerooatives' belonging to her sex; but will tend to confirm   her in those privileges which are necessary to her refined notions of comfort, and to the means of usefulness from which she derives her most rational and satisfactory enjoyment. And this system of education is equally befitting, in such  degrees as opportunity offers, or-occasion requires, the daughter of a European nobleman, and the daughter of an American citizen." W Will you be pleased, said I, "  to point out the precise man- ner of obtaining such an education ?" It comes partly," said Mr. Seabright, "from  the example of teachers, and  a   willingness to be instructed, as I  am  about to illustrate. Of the fundamental principles of Learming I shall treat when we take up  education in the abstract." " With men," he continued, ," the object in view--a fitness for some  favorilte calling-exercises an influence in the formation of   "8        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, their characters, and regulates, not only their minds for study, but in a great degree their behavior; and, finally, their affections. Ambition of riches, authority, rank, or renown, is their governing principle.; and they mould themselves in conformity to its dic- tates, and keep their partialities under its control. "But women, not being arbiters of their own destinies study without an aim, other than to make themselves agreeable companions and useful members of society.  They are, therefore, thrown into the hands of teachers, who receive them as passive material, and fashion them all after the same pattern, but in various degrees of perfection. The formation of the female character, thus confided to ar- tists, in its superficial bearing, which first comes under the general notice, requires stimulant and restraint, in very nearly equal pro- portions; and these contra-movements, governed by judicious mothers, competent female instructors, and an early acquaintance with good- society, harmonize admirably: the stimulant giving energy, the restraint self-possession, and the usages of society grace; all of which accomplishments are unattainable, if not ac- quired during the period of youth. VA man of a sound mind, but limited in education, may emerge firom obscurity; and from the freedom with which men associate, he s(on acquires the appearance and manners of a gen- j tleman; but if he even pass over many points of etiquette, he does it so independently, that their omission often becomes him'  quite as well as would their observance.   Not so with woman. She cannot adopt expedients,-she cannot bluster gracefully. And as the sex are always cautious in their intercourse, and great ob- servers of each other's character and manners, it is impossible for a lady to feel at ease on occasions which require a formal puncti-  lio, or where she feels that she is exposed to observation, unless ; she has been accustomed to act under a critical eye. -H The question is often asked, especially in countries recently peopled, like our own, where the business of money-making is the first, and almost the only consideration,-of what use is an expen- sive education to a female, since it qualifies her for no profession? The query is, certainly, a very natural one, and not unreasonable, in a community so entirely new and unsophisticated, as to preclude any divisions of rank in society. But society does fall into divi- sions in less time than it takes one generation to pass away; and J , '   PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.  some tae the lead, in consequence of their talents, their affluence, and their leisure to attend to the refinemnts  affluence among other circumstances, comes the proprie of gie.

" Whether an artificial state of society, or that which is more congenial to our early and natural inclinations, is most conducive to happiness, would not be easy for me to decide. But, certainly, it is a satisfaction to find ourselves equal to all the requirements of social refinement; and since the whole civilized world do agree in the opinion, that the learned and courteous are more entitled to admiration, more worthy of esteem, and more useful in carrying on the grand scheme 6f universal improvement, than the rude and ignorant, we should appear meanly ridiculous were we to pretend to despise that excellence which arises from exactions on the mind and manners. "Int the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, parents, who were desirous of seeing their daughters adorned with feminine grace, and subdued in that turbulence of spirit which is nourished by contact with the noisy world, placed them in convents. Even Protestant parents were willing to expose their children to the in- fluence of religious opinions at variance with their own, rather than der rive them of the benefits of a truly feminine deportment. 'There is no reason why Protestant schools should not equal convents in all that pertains to the method of instruction in those accomplishments which render a young lady passively superior, as well as to excel in those qualifications which prepare her to dis- charge all the obligations of womanhood to society with ease, honor and dignity, and which are not so well inculcated in the cloister system. "A social and active spirit, with perfect self-command, are beautifully blended in the sect called Quakers, or Friends. Who but admires the apparent purity of their sentiments, and' the gen- tleness of their manners? And yet none are capable of acting with an eye more single to their own interests, or of relishing the good things of this life with more zest than they. In them is shown, that the same course of education which imparts to the character a refined, and captivating humility, fits the mind for the trials of life, and also prepares it to act with energy, to receive blessings with a lively gratitude, and to be liberal in the enjoy- ment of them. But while I admire their system of forming the character, and believe that it may be conducive to their happiness as a sect, I consider it as being too limited in its purposes for gen- 6   122       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, eral imitation, and too stationary in its degree of excellence for the more expanded views of the world at large" Mrs. Carlisle thanked her brother for his interest in the im- provement of her sex, so delicately manifested in the present lec- ture,-in which he had shown an intimacy with all the minutiae pertaining to the acquirement of a correct deportment in young females.- She had not anticipated so much; and felt assured that his ideas on the two systems of education now in practice would be more acceptable than any thingthatshe could offer. She should, therefore, ask the favor of a dissertation on the subject the next evening. You lay an emphasis on the words 'two systems,'" said Mr. Seabright. "You doubtless have reference to the practice of ex- clusive male teachers for males, and a mixed faculty, where the man takes the lead and the woman is subordinate, in the educa- tion of females." "That is very nearly the idea which I intended to convey," said Mrs. Carlisle; " but I am oppressed with feelings of regret and mortification when I reflect, that, although we are by nature the proper guardians of the minds of the young of our own sex, there could not be found in all our ranks a sufficient number of females, of leisure and qualifications, to answer to one half the demand for teachers in female schools of the higher grade. And though an effort at reform should begin to-day, a whole century might pass away before the renovation would be complete." "My views on the subject of reform," answered Mr. Seabight, are very similar to those which you have now expressed; while I look upon the prompt exposure of the absurdities countenanced in the present usage as a first step toward a change. This is a subject over which I have brooded with intense indignation, as some passages in my life may hereafter show." He then quickly changed the subject, as if annoyed by some unpleasant recollec- tion. I felt deeply impressed with his manner, remembering that my father was in the habit of laying all my coquetish propensities to the account of my having been educated, almost exclusively, by male teachers. "Amy," said Mr. Seabright, "I did expect an occasional in- terruption on your part, and that I should enjoy the stimulant of a little opposition."   F ; "        THE PURE PLEASURES OF PU RE MNDS.     123 "Dear uncle," replied Amy, " you convince as you go along; and the subjects increase in interest every evening. I am more desirous of being converted to your opinions than of speaking my own." "That's a good girl," said Mr. Seabright. And taking Mr. Preble by the hand, he made some inquiries respecting his health during the day; and then retired. The next day Mr. Seabright's meals were taken to his room, and his servant Barney informed us that he had been writing all day, in his gown and slippers. In the evening, "A contrast in the management of Male and Female School"  was announced as the subject of the EIGHTH PARALLEL. The contrast.--"In the management of the education of females, began Mr. Seabright, " the consideration of their being reared and instructed by their own sex, in order to give them a literature in common, and to accustom  them  to respect the at- tainments of each other, has, in these United States, more than in any other country of the world, been sacrificed to the ready expe- - dient of intrusting the education of young girls to men. Men of worth, I acknowledge, are sought for this great responsibility, and chosen with a view to their moral excellence as much as to ' their classical attainments. It is usual in every section of this republic for parents, Protestant parents more especially, to place their daughters with female teachers only until they have acquired the simple rudiments of learning; or, at most, only until they are enough advanced   to enter on an academic course of studies. They are then- placed under the tuition of men, with perhaps a female usher.  The filst consequence is, that all literary intercourse between them   and their former beloved teachers is broken off; and the impression  is fixed on their minds that their own sex however much they have learned, cannot teach beyond  a certain point; and  that they therefore can have no further influence in forming the mental character. "At this time, when the waywardness of youth stands in need of a  check, and the mind, inclined to follow after its own giddy fancies, should be compelled by study and restraint to become rational, study is a matter of option, and restraint a timid request. And now, a  miss in her teens, supposing herself to be already a young lady, who has only to go through the process of 'finishing,' ,.-w   124       CHARACTERS UNVEITTED; OR, f takes little interest in her studies; and seeing that those, who have gone before her, are not catechised in the lessons which they learned at school, she looks upon them as useless, and treats them with a mere passing effort, in order to answer a question in her turn. And thus several years pass on. She has learned the names, and understands something of the nature and tendency of her studies; and has the reputation of being educated. Her teachers have done what they could. But a gentleman cannot com- pel a lady, however young she may be, to the performance of regular tasks, even though she be his pupil. "What a contrast in the management of boys. They are placed under masters, who were once boys like themselves. Their due performances are strictly exacted of them; and they are made to understand that if they do not apply themselves, compul- sion or expulsion is the antidote. "It is true that girls could not bear such treatment from men, for they begin at a very early age to admire themselves, and to expect all mankind to be pleased with their whims and fancies: and they will contrive, even in school, to have their own way. They are repeatedly excused- for their neglect of study, or only chided in a good-natured manner; and they fail to improve, not because improvement is not expected, but because it is not exacted of them : and their intercourse with their teachers is quite as often a course of compliments and concessions as of instructing and being instructed. This state of things cannot be remedied but by intrusting the entire education of female youth to the management of their own sex; for, in men, the influence which governs under the name of authority, and the affectionate manner, which engages the love and obedience of the female disciple, cannot be com- bined; while authority, absolute, on the part of a gentleman toward a lady pupil, would procure for his person a strong dislike, and be highly injurious to the interests of his school. He is aware of all this, and guards against it; and many a conscientious and  worthy teacher, out of patience, and burning with suppressed vexation, has been forced to smile, perhaps, to commend a per- formance, where, if the pupil had been a boy, a punishment would have been inflicted. "In those schools, and there are aifew of them, where none  but well-qualified females are employed to teach, the evils of re- missness is avoided, for, from the first, no injurious indulgence is allowed on the one part, nor expected on the other; while kind   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE' MNDS.    125 feelings are encouraged, and expressions of endearment soften the young hearts into obedience. A man must not practise that kind and familiar deportment by which the female teacher wins the affection and submission of her charge. Since the days of Abe- lard and Eloise, much has been said and written on the danger of teacher and pupil forming attachments. And many a sorrow- mg parent, many a blighted daughter, now lives to bear testi- mony to the dangers of this unfortunate liability. "But it is said that the services of male teachers are required in many schools professedly kept by females. And why are they required? The reason is plain. For instance, a lady is ' reduced to the necessity of keeping a school.' She may not be qualified for the task of instruction; and she may not be able to procure those of her own sex who are competent to supply her place. But that matters not, since it is allowable, and even fashionable, to call in male teachers to fill every department of importance. These gentlemen, generally foreigners, step into the school-room neatly attired, and practised in the graces of deportment. The young ladies seek to please such fine gentlemen,--not by making progress in their studies, but by arranging, in the best possible manner, their dress; and by adopting such manners as in their view should be the most captivating. Here they learn their first lesson in coquetry; and fly, in raptures, from the school into that society of which their gentlemen teachers had given them a fore- "What would be the effect on the young men in our colleges, were their sedate, dignified, and learned professors dispensed with, and their places supplied by ladyPl'ofessors!-gay, handsome, and cunning; and whose on y desires would be to make themselves agreeable, and to be well paid for their services?" "With men," continued Mr. Seabright, " disgrace follows the misapplication of educational advantages. With women there is no such disgrace, since the opportunities for improvement, and not the things learned, are set down to their credit. "AYet, there are some females who will learn under any cir- cumstances; and we as often find such among those who never graduated from a  'Female Institute' as among those who have Sometimes they are altogether self-educated; and these serve to show the close affinity between the male and female understand- ing. But it is generally the case that a young lady comes home from school, and announces to her admiring fiends that she has   126       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, learned every thing'. It may be true that she has obtained some general ideas of almost every thing; and that may be deemed sufficient by those who consider a course of study, under instruc- tion, as a mere matter of discipline for the mind. But experience, too often, afterwards, brings the blush of shame for the deficiency of useful attainments. In every department of literature some- +thing more is necessary than just enough to embarrass the pos- sessor. It is, therefore, better to understand a few things well, than to traverse the whole cyclopedia of the sciences with indifferent success. And yet, it seems to be of very little importance with many parents and teachers for a young lady to be able to read her native language correctly, provided she has a smattering of some half-dozen others. The following incident will serve to illustrate, where the most profound argument might fail to convince, of the folly of pursuing too great a variety of accomplishments to the neglect of a necessary and most agreeable acquirement. "A very amiable girl once boasted to me of her profound knowledge of the science of Hydrostatics. I entered into conver- sation with her, in a manner to draw forth some opinion of her own on the subject. After blushing and hesitating several times, she candidly said, 'I could answer all the questions of my teacher because the questions were laid down, and the answers marked off for me; but I am sure I shall never be able to converse on the subject of Hydrostatics.' "Another bachelor present,-an older man than myself-- Do not smile so, young ladies.-Well, the other gentleman present, who had been looking over a newspaper, and, as it proved, had been listening all the while, said, 'Never mind, Miss. I should not care whether a wife of mine knew any thing about Hydrosta- tics or not; but I should like to know if you are a good reader; so, now, be so kind as to take this paper, and read the article in fine print, for my eyes are getting dim.' 'With pleasure,' said the lady, ' I will read for you.' She took the paper from his hand, and read very, very badly. 'Why! said the gentleman, 'Did you not learn to read at school ' ' We did not read Eng- lish very often for the last two years,' she replied, ' but we read Latin, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and'  Stop, stop, cried the single man, and he looked as though he were inwardly rejoicing that he was not united to a bad reader. "' LI will tell you,' said the young lady,'what I can do. I can play for you.' And, in a twinkling, her foot was on the forte   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      127 !edl] of the piano, and every key was called into immediate reo quisition. After .this introductory movement, she placed a volume of music before her, and turning to 'O, MON CHER AUGUSTIN? commenced on ' Variations, faciles,  brilliantes et doighthes,' and soon gave us to understand that she was, indeed, mistress of her music; and that a semibreve was no more under her hand than a grace-note. "When she had given the last touch, she whirled round on her music seat, and exclaimed, with quite a pretty air of triumph, 'There, now, can't I play' She looked so satisfied, so girlish, and so sweet-tempered, that I could not have found it in my heart to speak against her performance. But not so with our companion. He was in the habit of ' speaking out ;' and he- promptily replied, 'No, you cannot play.' 'Why, sir,' said the mortified lady, 'my teacher, Signor Fantasie, was always in raptures whenever I played ' MON CHER AUGUSTIN.' I Signor Fantasie, indeed!! re- joined the testy gentleman;--Signor Fan-tas-ie, truly ' And as he buttoned up his coat, and gathered up his stick, with the in- tention of taking a walk, he muttered to himself,' I love to hear music, that which deserves the name. But, hang me if I had not rather have a girl that can read well than one who can play like an angel.' "' My young friend was completely disconcerted ; and, as all good girls are allowed to do when they find people very hard to please, she cried as if her dear little heart would break. But, from that hour, she determined to be educated, and soon after entered one of those Catholic Seminaries where all the duties of teaching devolve on females. In four years she returned to her parents a good scholar, and an accomplished lady; and she is now the wife of one of our ambassadors at a foreign court. "In the first instance, this lady was educated fashionably, by fashionable teachers. In the second, she was in a school where the teachers were excluded from a participation in the vanities of the world, and devoted to their profession; and where the dis- cipline was maintained in as rigid a manner as in the most ap- proved establishments for the education of the other sex. Her teachers were instructors, rather than admirers, and her improve- ment was such as to show that a woman can be educated without the aid of a Signor Fantasie. "I am not a Catholic, neither shall I ever become one, yet I, always allowing myself to appreciate merit wherever I find it,   128       CHARACTERS UNVElUDn ; OR, am compelled to speak in high terms of the judicious manage- ment of their schools, or of such as I have visited, or become ac- quainted with by other means. And I do recommend, in certain particulars, their example; not doubting, that with a determined effort on our part, a popular change might be wrought in our sys- tem of female education. We, the Protestants and Dissenters, are no less a religious people than the Catholics; and they dis- seminate their religion by means of their seminaries of learning; ,and it has almost become a proverb, even in Protestant communi- ties, that ' If you wish your daughters to be thoroughly and re- ligiously educated, you must send them to Catholic schools.' In the Southwestern portion of the United States, the Catholics monopolize almost the entire patronage of the most influential families. "The Catholic schools are not every thing that we could wish, even though we might apprehend nothing from their religious in fluences; but we have confidence in the' Sisterhood' who conduct them, and feel an assurance that the end for which we commit our daughters to their care, will be attained. And how do the Sis- ter's manage to make those gay young creatures happy and con- tented, without the society of friends, and secluded from the ad- miration of the world? The answer is plain. Every creature is won by kindness. The Sisters are kind,-more so than men could, with prudence, be toward young and susceptible females." "It is evident," said Mr. Preble, " that women were designed for teaching, from the controlling influence which nature has given them, and from the fact that they are capable of imparting know- ledge with as much clearness as men, and in a manner better suited to 'the feminine apprehension. A peculiar charm of female teaching, whether it be from a mother or a professional instruct- ress, is that they are inclined to keep the Deity in view, even in the most ordinary duties of their calling; and their manner of communicating religious truths seems not so abstract as is usually the manner of men." "A faithful instructress, or mother," said Mrs. Carlisle, " feels it a privilege to be engaged in expanding the germ implanted by the Creator, and in leading the young mind to the worship of Him who has endowed it with a principle of immortality. Women, whose dependent lives lead them to feel the need of the consola- tions of religion, are inclined to see it made practical in others, as well as in themselves; and in order to extend its influence, in con-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS,       129 junction with the benefits of learning, they should enlarge their own sphere of action, so far as to abandon a self-debasing compli- ance with a popular custom. "Such an expression of your sentiments," said Mr. Seabright, "gives me confidence in the rationality of my own. But as more agreeable, if not more important considerations, are in reserve for our subsequent conversations, we will glance at a general estimate of character, which must conclude the remarks on the ' Two Sys- tems,'-as you, my dear Mrs. Carlisle, have very appropriately termed the present practice." NINTH PARALLEL. Estimate of character.--"The reason, as I have before inti- mated, why women do not associate in learning, with the same gen- erous confidence as men, is because they do not allow themselves, as an established usage, to be instructed beyond a certain limit by each other. And of those who can, with any propriety, pretend to a liberal education, each one wanders whithersoever she will, all taking care to keep aloof from each other. Colleges have a tendency to con- centrate the male talent of every civilized nation--and why should not female talents be brought into contact, and strengthened in a similar way? There are ladies in every part of the country, who, to the finest qualities of the heart, add high and valuable liter- ary attainments. And could such meet, trusting in themselves, and form associations for the purpose of promoting the education of their own sex, their well-stored minds might become public trea- sures, instead of miserly repositories. We should be glad to hear of their 'Conventions,' were they but free from the din of discon- tent, and confined to questions of possible improvement. "Our female friends are not wanting in philanthropy, in gen- erosity, or in efforts to do good in any way consistent with their notions of propriety. They enter readily into any plan for im- proving the condition of the poor; they aid in sending mission- aries to the heathen; they entertain strangers, and lift up their voices in the cause of the captive. They pay enormously for the support of schools,-but where, among Protestants, is the lady, except of those oppressed with poverty, who would allow herself to be placed at the head of a literary institution, or to become a member of a Board of Female Trustees    The disposition is, doubtless, in favor of such an arrangement; but the way is un- 6*   130       CHARACTERS UNVEITRLDn; OR, broken, and they are afraid of ' remarks,'-therefore unwisely re- main exposed to them. "It cannot be that women have any thing to fear from our envy or opposition; for have we not steadily encouraged them in all their efforts at mental improvements. Do we not aid them in every enterprise of utility? Do they fear that we shall regard them as rivals, and feel ourselves in danger of being superseded? We are not so contemptible. The character of man has no fron- tier. What has he, then, to apprehend from  the emulation of women, whose constitutional timidity inclines them to look with fear beyond certain bounds? This is not their folly, but discre- tion ; and we are not without the belief, that great minds, wisely bent, might find room for profitable exercise, without any material enlargement of their present sphere. We regard women, within their own element, as our superiors in religion and morality, and our equals in all things wherein the general welfare allows of com- petition. We are even desirous that they should establish a more decided municipality under their own control; for we are aware that the more their proceedings tend to give them self-respect, the more they will scorn to deviate from their womanly character. "But to return to the subject of education, the lever which raises and exalts the community, or any portion of the communi- ty. Is learning less becoming in woman than in man 2 The ques- tion is preposterous! Even the Chinese honor their learned ladies. Do not people learn in order to elevate their capacities?-to acquire influence, and to become servicable to society? Most certainly they do. Then why should the learning of women be of no ac- count, when men make it a capital investment for their own and the public good? Those men who have been most celebrated for their literary attainments have almost invariably been teachers in some way cf the youth of their own sex. The lawyer, the divine, and the phy- sician, instruct young men who are preparing themselves for their respective professions; and the student does not seek out the most needy nor the most far-fetched for his instructor, but the most in- telligent or best qualified. And, as mind acts upon mind, and character upon character, young men, with their rugged intellect and bold defiance, receive more benefit from the prompt teach- ings of those in whose capacities they have confidence, and whom they dare not contemn, than could they from the servile assiduity of untested strangers; or from men whose poverty constitutes   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      131 their chief recommendation, and whose fear to offend robs them of the dignity necessary to insure them the respect of their pu- pils. Men need all their firmness in training those who are to become men, and in whom a rebellious spirit is seldom wanting. But they are by nature, and should be by practice, too decided to lead young, females in the tiresome paths of learning; and when they lay aside their decision of character, and exercise that indulgence which their pupils think it but reasonable to expect from men, to whom they invariably look for kindness and forbearance, then is their influence doubtful, and their authority turned into obsequiousness-their command into entreaty." e "Amy," said Mr. Seabright, " which shall we next enter upon, -moral attributes, or mental capacities .w -"If I may be allowed to answer the question," said Mis. Car- lisle, I should say the L mental' capacities, since the moral attri- butes generally grow out of them." "That is doubtless the case to a very great extent," said Mr. Seabright; "and in the operations of sympathy, which is a moral attribute, a striking difference is observed in the mental constitu- tion of the male and the female." "Will you please to refer that to a future lectured" said Amy; " for my whole mind is now filled with the one subject- that of what we are capable of performing, and how we compare with yourselves." "Shall we take up belles-lettres?" said Mrs. Carlisle. "Certainly," said Mr. Seabright; " the natural concomitant of education, however or by whom  acquired; and will afford much interesting matter for the TENTH PARALLEL. Belles-lettres. -The whole of the next day was spent by Mr. Seabright and Mr. Carlisle in a room by themselves,-" com- paring ideas," according to Amy's suggestion. In the evening we were in waiting, as usual. Mrs. Carlisle had a manuscript in her hand, upon which Mr. Seabright cast some very approving glances. "I have sometimes," said Mr. Seabright, " known experiments to be made in order to test the similarity of the male and female   132        CHARACTERS UNVETTFIn ; OR, genius and style of writing; and in every instance have detected the same difference in their mental as in their physical characters. Girls write with more readiness than boys, but their compositions have less of strength and variety of style. They, however, pos- sess a meaning more true to every-day experience; and, when not too diffuse, interest us from their lively spirit, or their touching pathos. Girls are easily interested in novel subjects, which they bring home to their minds, and arrange them according to the patterns previously formed there by intuition, as much as by ac- quired principles. It is this which stamps a family likeness on almost all the productions of the female pen. A class of girls can make up an article, conjointly, with the greatest ease,--that is, give them the items separately and they will eke out a narative (as I have discovered, this day) so plausible, that the reader might suppose it to be the work of a single individual. But when boys write, each one strikes out, in his own peculiar style; and the less like that of any other, the more satisfactory to himself. "I once saw a composition written by a class of boys at school-(I regret exceedingly that I did not obtain a copy of it). The subject was the 'Circle Hunt,' an amusement common in Canada during some of the winter months, and which I was told was of Russian origin. In this composition each lad was required to write a paragraph, descriptive of some portion of the scene. To one it was given to describe the hunters and dogs; to another the setting out of the party; to another the frozen fields, and the leaf- less woods; to another the terror of the hunted animals; and an- other the ponds covered with ice; another the battle; another the barbecue feast; and to the last, the return of the sportsmen to their homes. "They finished the task, and every part was spirited and ex- cellent in its way (for they had all witnessed the diversion). But no two sections would adhere on account of the great diversity of style, and because each portion had a beginning and finish, with- out reference to any other part of the scene than that which it described. The paragraphs did not seem to run out of each other, like a continued narrative by the same writer. I saw the manuscript in the hands of their teacher-a clergyman. He com- pared it to the 'good things of a donation feast.' "The same experiment, Mrs. Carlisle informs me, was tried on a class of young females at a school in Lexington, Kentucky, giv- ing to each, as on the occasion already mentioned, some portion   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      133 of the narrative, a copy of which she will now oblige us by read- ing. THE DOVE'S NEST.--"In the interior of the State of Kentucky, and at some distance from any town or village, is a beautifully romantic situation called ' The Dove's Nest,' from the circumstance of its belonging to a young female who lives there in splendid so- litude, with no other companions than an aged governess, and a bevy of the sable descendants of Africa." "The parents of this lovely girl emigrated from Europe, and brought with them immense wealth. From some freak of fancy, or of judgment, they sought a home in the, then, wilds of the west, where they purchased a large tract of land, with a great number of negroes. They laid out their grounds in a very taste- ful manner--erected buildings in the most expensive style, and al- together in strange contrast with the wild scenery around them. Unfortunately, they soon fell victims to the climate, leaving their only child in care of the English governess who had accompanied them in their wild expedition. This lady was true to her charge, and well qualified for the task of giving instruction; and her young friend and pupil, at the time when we saw her, was highly intelli- gent and accomplished." "This delightful situation was in a valley. / The house stood on a sloping lawn, in front of which flowed a sil,very branch of the Cumberland river; and behind it, toward the west, mounds and broken cliffs seemed to vie with the lofty hills which interposed between the setting sun and the valley of the LDove." "In the gay and green pastures reposed numerous domestic animals. Cattle lying in the shade, or standing in the pools,- sheep, in their white fleeces, among the shrubbery on the sides of the hills,-horses, remarkable for their beauty, attracted the eye,- and poultry, interesting from their numbers and variety, gave ani- mation to the farm-yard." "At a distance from the house, on the north, was the orchard, extending from  the foot of the hill to an easterly bend in the river. Here might be found every tree that could be nurtured in so variable a climate; and the delicious fruits fell, like drops of dew, from  their branches." "In front of the  dwelling was a large flower-garden, laid out in many fanciful forms, separated by walks and pathways. Many of the plants were rare and odoriferous. A large marble fountain stood in the centre of the garden, and from it fell water clear as   134       CHARACTERS UNVFITI D; OR, crystal. A finetree of natural growth, adorned with a profusion of the delicate mistletoe, spread its foliage over the fountain; and birds from the neighboring hills came to sing in its branches. "The carhiage-hoses, a beautiful pair of bays, stood ready for the harness. The carriage, which was of an invisible green, had two inner seats. The linings were of white uncut velvet, with blue and silver lace. The hammercloth was of deep blue, with lace like that upon the inside. The floor and steps were covered with carpet of white, brown, and blue. On a panel was in- scribed the arns of the family,--an emblem hardly reconcilable to our republican fancies. Thedriver and footman were habited in  rich liveies, ready for an excursion in the roads through the forests." "The house-servants, after the fashion of the southern and western States, were very numerous, and aristocratically dark.- There were Caroline and Susan, the chambermaids; Judy, the seamstress; Ginger, the cook; Lucy and Sally, the washerwomen; Winney, the housekeeper; Sylvia, the lady's maid; Tristam, the ! runner; Jerry, the coachman; Peter, the footman; and Sampson, the porter.' The main building was of white granite, brought n boats from other parts of the country. It was finished with a gan  ; portico in front; and on the top was a small tower, which seemed rather to have been designed for a child's playhouse than as a point of observation. The carriage-house and other out-buildings were of a lead color, with white fionts. The whole was, in some measure, enveloped in trees and shrubbery, and presented an ap- pearance of modest elegance."  "Trhe hall-floor was covered with India matting; and hat and  umbrella-stands were placed in a recess. From the ceiling was suspended a lamp; and the sides were graced with maps of the i two hemispheres." The drawing-room windows were shaded with curtaias. The  sofas and lounges were covered with stuff of the same colon The  mirrors were splendid, and many other articles were of equal costliness and beauty" The furniture of the dining-room was of dark mahogany. The sideboard was of the finest old-fashioned workmanship, with a white marble top. On the low shelf was a chased silver urn, and a nest of salvers. On the top were two large silver pitchers, an urn, and a bowl, embossed in scenes which opened to the wind-    THE PURE PLEASURES  OP PURE MNDS.      135 ing horn.' There were along the edge two rows of tumblers, of the same precious metal as the rest. Among other articles not yet enumerated, were two drinking cups with gold linings. They were set apart from the other plate with some care, and a trans- parent paper thrown over them." "Next to the dining-room was a large parlor with four win- dows, besides an oriel. In this oriel was mounted a telescope, for whose use it does not appear. The mouldings and the doors of this room were of mahogany. The knobs were of silver, and the mantels of veined marble. The paper on the wall was white, fluted, with arches, and wreathed with pale flowers. There was, in the ceiling, a fine centre-piece, from which was suspended a chandelier. The furniture of this room was covered with Russia linen, therefore I cannot describe it." "The kitchen, which was not within the main building, was large, and in the most perfect order. The floor was of oak, and the shelves of white pine, perfectly clean and nice. Bright tin pans graced a portion of the wall. Brass kettles, copper tea-kettles and saucepans, burnished and bright, were arranged on the shelves below, while lighter utensils figured to advantage above. In one part of the kitchen was fixed a marble slab, for the purpose of making pastry; and near it was a large marble basin, by the side of which stood a tray, for the purpose of taking things to and from the dining-room. But that which gave the kitchen a pecu- liar air of domestic comfort was a tortoise-shell cat, which sat pur- ring, and wiping her face with her paws, in the chimney corner." "After returning from this department, we ascended a flight of stairs, which led to a suite of bedrooms, apparently designed for visitors. The walls of these rooms were perfectly white. Each room  contained a single bed, with pure white coverings. The floors were covered with straw mattings. These appeared lil/e very cool sleeping apartments for summer; and directly opposite were rooms furnished in a more substantial manner, with green silk curtains and quilts, and woollen carpets, and grates for fire in winter."                    I "The lady's own bedroom was that in which her parents had fallen asleep in death; therefore, a hallowed sanctuary to their orphan child. It was a large room, with three windows and two doors, one of which opened into the passage leading to the stair- case; the other to a large closet. The paper-hangings of this chamber were of a delicate blue ground, with silver stars, repre-   136       CHARACTERS UNVE IJ E; OR, senting the constellations. The curtains of the bed and windows were of pale blue silk, lined with white. The carpet was a drab ground, with blue and white flowers. At the foot of the bed was a small low table, on which lay a Bible; and on the floor a mat for kneeling. I felt my eyes fill with tears, as I contemplated these silent witnesses of devotion." "But the most interesting part of this establishment was the lady's private parlor, in which the eye was first attracted by yellow damask curtains, with white linings and gold fringes. They were supported by gilded darts, crossing each other near the barbs; and on the crossings a golden eagle, with a small scroll, firmly compressed in its beak. Here were emblems, but what clue was there to their meaning?

"The pictures were chiefly portraits. There was one group consisting of a gentleman, a lady, and a child. The gentleman was stout, but finely formed, and of noble aspect. He stood in a musing attitude, with his eye half directed towards the lady, who, with a sweet smile, sat with her infant on her knee. Her eyes followed us, and seemed to invite our attention to the little cherub, which was trying to reach at a ringlet of her hair. The other portraits interested us less. There was one picture, which was pointed out to us as having been the work of the former mistress of this gorgeous edifice. It represented a harvest scene in Switz- erland. In the foreground were a man and woman tying sheaves. Near them was a woman sitting on a hillock, with a child in her arms, and a little girl sleeping by her side. She appeared to be in conversation with a man, whom we supposed to be her hus- band, and whose eyes were resting on a basket and a pitcher which stood on the ground. Further on were two men reaping, and another gathering up the grain. An old man was passing by on a mule, and looking intently upon the reapers, towards whom he appeared to be directing a little girl, who carried a flagon in her hand, and a loaf under her arm. She was followed by a dog, which seemed to be after the loaf, which she defended by a stick in her other hand. In the background was a wagon descending a hill, with a man leading the horses, which appeared to be res- tive. On the hill stood two cottages, half hidden by the foliage of the trees. And, last of all, was a view of a distant forest. I   THE -URE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      137 had never seen a landscape into which so much life had been thrown. But my thoughts turned from these figures to the hand which traced them. Alas! cold in death." "The carpet was of fine Saxony wool, of a delicate salmon color, on which the manufacturer had scattered blossoms in gay profusion. The border, of more dense colors, formed a protecting outline to this assemblage of pinks, hyacincths, and roses; and the soft green rugs appeared like resting-places in a field of flowers.". "The chairs were of black mahogany, cushioned with an em- broidered haircloth. The backs were low, but cushioned in the same manner as the seats, and bordered with an ornamental framework. There was also a large arm-chair, with a very high back. It was famished with a drawer and pockets. The sofas were of the finest rosewood, covered with cloth worked in cruel. On the back of one was the Capitol at Washington, with a por- tion of the surrounding scenery; and on the other, the President's house and grounds. On one ottoman was the Patent Office, and on another the United States' Bank at Philadelphia. On one small and elegant divan was a representation of the Masonic Hall in Lexington, and on another the New Medical College. All this work was done by the lady herself, from drawings furnished her by persons whose curiosity had led them to visit her hospitable lmansion." "This parlor had an open fireplace without grating, and de- signed for comfortable wood fires in winter. The fender was of cast iron, with silver rings and knobs. The andirons, shovel and tongs, were of fine steel, tipped with silver. The bellows was of satin-wood, curiously silvered with Chinese devices. The hand- screens were of unburnished gold paper, cut in the forms of flame, and so painted as to represent a cheerff:'l blaze." "A piano, of the finest workmanship, stood near the wall, and over it hung a large mirror. Yet the lady, whom we found in this room, did not appear like one who was in the habit of ad- niring herself in the glass.  But perhaps her image was some- times her only companion. The music-books were bound in dark- green morocco, and piled on a stand in a corner of the room, near which stood a harp, covered, and a guitar encased." ' When we arrived, the young lady was just preparing for a ride with her governess. She received us in a most courteous manner; so much so, that we felt rather like invited guests than   138        CHARACTERS UNVEITT  ; OR,           ! unceremonious intruders. We should have admired her had she not been beautiful, but beautiful indeed she was. Her form was fine, her hair dark, her eyes blue, and her complexion very fair. In her appeared to be united the bloom of the foreigner with the delicacy of the American. In her manners she was too highly cultivated to be vulgar; and being too little acquainted with the world to appreciate the advantages which wealth and beauty had given her, she was equally free from haughtiness and rude sim- plicity. Although dignified, she was childlike; and while cheer- ful and attentive to all around her, a thoughtfulness sat on her brow.' "She was dressed in a brown satin. The bonnet which she threw off, on our entrance, was of dark velvet, lined with white, and a pretty lace cap. Her shawl was of fine Cashmere, the bor- der of leaves and acorns on a rich brown ground. Her shoes were of dark satin, her stockings brown, with white embroidered clocks, and gloves of the same color and finish. In her hand she held a handkerchief of fine thread cambric, with a curiously i wrought border, and her name at full length on the corner. She wore a small watch, which, however, was invisible, and only known to be in her possession by a chain, and a real or imaginary ' tick, tick' On a finger of the left hand we observed a plain gold ting of the most minute dimensions. After taking leave, we made up our minds to believe that this last was a token of some engage- ment: ' "In the above," said Mrs. Carlisle, "each young lady de- scribed something that she might have seen; and the existence of a family in circumstances similar to those described was a well- known fact. Therefore nothing more than a taste for description was exercised. The similarity of style was acquired from  the habit of writing in class, and hearing the compositions of each other read" "The boys already referred to," said Mr. Seabright, "were treated in the same way; but each kept up a style of his own. Boys always write best on subjects of their own choosing.' "Why is it," asked Mrs. Carlisle, that plagiarisms, m the writings of men, are more easily detected than in the writings otf women"  "Itis answered Mr. Seabright, "because the former, true to  To    '                   Wi   THE PURE PLEASURES  OF PURE MNDS.     139 his character in other respects, is an original in this; and if he make use of an idea or an expression belonging to another, the appropriation is out of place, and offensive to the reader. Even the most apt quotations mar the tenor of his pages, and lessen the beauty of that which is original, by exposing the weakness or the bad taste which calls in aid from other authors. "The writings of women abound more in quotations than those of men, not because their style is improved by them, but in consequence of the facility with which they accommodate them- selves to the opinions of others, and this deplorable pliancy is one of the causes why we find so little originality in their works. They sooner-seize on the materials of other authors than search into the deep recesses of their own minds, which oftentimes con- tain treasures worthy an effort to bring to light, and which men would bring to light. Women are rather inclined to get ideas from books than from observation. They sooner adopt the opin- ions of others than coin them from their own reflections. De- pendence seems to be their inheritance, and they use it as a pri- vilege. "To be equal to the best, according to their own standard, is the ambition of literary women. To excel is the desire of literary men. Women oftener fail from want of exertion than from a de- ficiency of talent; but they are wiser than ourselves; they never mope or die of grief, because the world does not see fit to award the praise which they think due to the merit of their works. They are prudently content with their own approbation, and that of those who are dear to them. "But nothing can exceed the chagrin of a disappointed male author. Whether his treatise, his essay, his novel, or his poem, be the effusion of his own brain, or filched from more favored writes, still its condemnation or neglect fills his mind with an in- describable sense of wrong. If it pass through the hands of a reviewer, and there receive the brand of worthlessness, he looks upon his case as being decided; his wounded spirit groans; sleep flies from 'the pillow upon which he lays his fevered brain; he hates the world, and loathes himself; he strikes his breast in agony, now summoning perseverance, and now calling on despair. If the former answer the summons, it stimulates him to higher efforts; if the latter, it goads him with his disgrace, until every noble faculty of his mind is prostrate for ever. "The best female writers are those of a moral and religious   "O        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, character; for in morality they are their own umpire, and in re. ligion they never go beyond the bounds of their own experience; and, therefore, write on these subjects without so much of the de- pendence peculiar to their sex, and without the bigotry too cornm- mon in our own. They are happier than those who make choice of lighter themes, since the humility, which ever accompanies a devotional and benevolent spirit, tempers the pride of the writer, and secures the mind equally against excess of vanity or of disap- pointment. If applause follow their efforts, they receive it with satisfaction; if neglect ensue, no excitement takes place. With those whose writings have neither a religious nor a reform ten- dency, poetry, as a resource only for the pastime of the writer, should be preferred to prose, for the play of the fancies dispose the mind of the poetess to be pleased with its own metres; and some women who disregard their own prose writings, which are good, will, nevertheless, dandle their poetry, however little merit may be seen in it by others. "But men, who imagine themselves possessed of poetic fire, indulge in a temperament of very different order; and more votaries fail at the shrine of Parnassus, than in any other depart- ment of literature. Very few are poets by nature; and even to those, the access to their proper destination is neither easy nor cheering. But to the vivid imaginations of the lovers of rhyme, whose visions of fancy are hailed as inspiration, the ascent looks so easy, and the fortunate few who have attained a high elevation, ap- pear so dazzling, that the giddy aspirant springs forward, and run- ning with vigor round the foot of the mountain, soon imagines himself at considerable height, and looks about for the gaze of ad- miration, and listens for the shouts of applause which his sanguine hopes had promised. But when he sees few to admire, and none to encourage him, his heart sinks, and his embryo fame dies, in his own belief, a martyr to the insensibility of the world. "Let all, whether male or female, who aspire to poetic fame, remember that those who gain the prize, do so at the expense of the finest feelings with which humanity is susceptible of being endowed. It is, indeed, to their wounded sensibilities, that we owe almost all that is beautiful and sublime in poetry. Was their path upward a promenade of pleasure, the refined, the virtuous, and the good, would find but little to admire in their effusions."

"It is only those," said Mr. Seabright, "who count the cost, that do become great. They bargain with themselves to endure every species of suffering to which their course is liable: and where the genius is sufficient the perseverance is equally so; but, as we are under no obligation to become great, let us be satisfied with becoming useful and good." 'I mnust participate, a little, in the chagrin of Amy," said Mrs. Carlisle; "for, although I have never attempted to become any thing more than a well-ordered member of society, yet I feel that there is melancholy in the picture which you have just drawn." "We will try to remove the unpleasant impression from your mind," said Mr. Seabright, "by some observations on the lan- guages, in which, on a late occasion, I had the mortification of finding you too great an adept.  And as this subject will afford material for comparison, it will be the burden of the ELEVENTH   PARALLEL." The Languages.--"All useful knowledge," said Mr. Seabright, "is desirable. Of that branch which enters into our social com-  munications, the modern languages are particularly so; as they are not only a convenience in giving us access to a wider field of literature, but they bring a great share of self-applause and felicity to the mind; and give eclat to the education. And there is no intellectual acquirement, the elementaries-reading, writing, etc., excepted, for which the traveller, more especially, has so fi'equent occasion.  There is a satisfaction, complimentary to ourselves, in being able to converse with foreigners in their own vernacular. It affords us a pleasure which we can receive from no other portion of learning. The memory seems filled with living wealth. The tongue becomes endued with-the   changeful character of a Pro- teus, and the ear with the acuteness of a Mercury." Mr. Seabright hesitated, as if he would say something more, but doubted the propriety.  Mrs. Carlisle smiled, and assured him that she was "an impartial hearer." "I have always," said Mr. Seabright, "observed, that males more readily acquire correct ideas of the principles of composition; and sooner make themselves acquainted with the rudiments of a T^   "2        CHARACTERS UNVEITED; OR, language, than females. But the latter obtain a command of phrases, and use them with greater facility, both in speaking and in writing. This fact may be observable, to a very great extent, in the works of female authors, who generally study the living in preference to the dead languages. I once took up a book which I found in the cabin of a packet-ship, and without examining the title-page, began listlessly to turn over the leaves, which were literally besprinkled with French,-quotation-marked, and itali. cized. 'A woman has done this,' thought I.  It was, ' Travels on the Continent,' by Mis.   ." "A  great deal of vanity is sometimes shown by writers in the use of foreign ornament" said Mrs. Carlisle. "But females are not alone culpable in this respect. A certain class of male authors 1 introduce the same kind of adornment into their pages. And even those staid disciples of the ' old school,' who affect contempt for the contents of modern phrase-books, exhibit, nevertheless, no small share of pedantry in the use of Greek and Latin quotations. It is said they are led to this alternative from the idea that those languages abound in forcible sentiments, for which they have oc- casion, but which would fail to convey their meaning if translated. It is, however, saying most tacitly, that the author writes only for the literati; and does not care to be understood by vulgar readers, who are, in truth, the only persons that can see any merit in the substitution of another language for their own." Mr. Seabright would not allow us to make a single comment on this last discourse, although he appeared in a right good hu- mor, and had something kind to say to each one of us. Mr. Preble was full of smiles, and they were all intended for Mrs. Carlisle. - "What shall be our next consideration?" said Mr. Seabright. I ventured to propose "music," as naturally following "lan- guages.  "Certainly," said Mrs. Carlisle. "And as my brother is vely fond of music, he cannot fail to offer such ideas as will be agree- "able to us all, but more especially to you, who will be better able to appreciate them,"          -- I replied, that "I loved music very much; and had I been guided by the counsel of my father, I should have been well-  versed in the science, which he believed to be necessary, in order ?S   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       143 to become a correct performer. And I hope, Mr. Seabright," said I, addressing myself to him, " that you will point out the way for me to improve, in anticipation of my dear father's return." Mr. Seabright gave me a look of kindness and satisfaction, and then sank into a sort of reverie, from which Mr. Preble aroused him, by saying, "You are very fond of music? Mr. Seabright." To which the latter answered, "I am becoming immoderately so. And I have some opinions concerning it, which I have gathered from various sources; and if it please my dear sister, and all pre- sent, I will make them the theme of the TWELFTH PARALLEL.". M'uskc.--This lecture seemed to be, in its censures, addressed to myself; and I should have thought, with a personal meaning, had not Mr. Seabright often remarked, on what he was pleased to term, the purity of my style. I therefore listened to his strictures, as being of general application, although it was evident that they were intended for my particular consideration. "Music," said Mr. Seabright, ' like all the other sciences, en- riches the mind; and when practically understood, is a splendid accomplishment for the young. It is alike agreeable to the per- former and to the listener, conveying to the mind of each the most pleasing sensations. A succession of harmonious sounds, as they fall upon the ear, awaken in the breast chords which vibrate in unison, and make us sensible of a sympathetic and tranquillizing influence. "To be' able to perform well, particularly on the harp and the piano, requires good instruction, and much time in the study, and in the practice. It is not enough to understand the connection between the written music and the keys or strings of the instru- ment. A   knowledge of the mathematical disposition of sounds, together with the proper method of touching the keys or strings which are to show their relation, and all the graces of the art of playing, should be, as far as is consistent with good taste, acquired -also sufficient skill in adapting the music to the occasion, to ena- ble the performer, especially a female performer, to make, at all times, a suitable selection for the amusement, the consolation, or even the criticism of her friends. Parents who endeavor to pro- cure this accomplishment for their daughters, at great trouble and expense, are not always gratified when they wish to hear the ails   CHARACTERS UNVFJTFOn; OR,                    T they love most; for the false idea that music has become modern. ized, so as to make it necessary to discard all but the latest and most popular productions, prevents many an otherwise amiable girl from endeavoring to discover, and to practise that which would be most agreeable to those, to whom a sacrifice of her own momen- tary pleasure is due. "It is no objection to the study of music, when we say, that ladies usually discontinue to play when the weightier cares of life demand their attention, and render them too sedate for the plea. sure of contributing by their own performances to the diversion of their friends; or when they may have more matronly resources for their entertainment ;-or, even if they choose to yield the privilege of display to their daughters or others, without competition. A mother, though possessed of high musical attainments, may refuse to play or sing for the amusement of others, but the charm of sweet sounds still retains its influence over her mind, and she pre- sides amid the youthful members of her household, without the imputation of knowing less than they. And while she criticizes their performances in a kind and judicious manner, deserves the homage of their best efforts to please. "Music is appreciated by the world in general, rather for its social influence, than for its merits as a sublime and wonderful sci- ence. It is the happiness of those who woo its charms, and make it their pastime. Even in its simplest character, it promotes har- mony and kind feeling among those who seek, in its pleasures, a relief from their cares. "But there is a something called 'music,' which does not de- serve the name. It enlivens no home, it solaces not the weary hours of the kind parent, nor brings cheerfulness and delight to the smiling brother and his companions. It thrills the nerves, but touches not the finer sensibilities of the heart. It may be defined as the frequent and fashionable exhibition of unnatural shreds of sound, caught from 'Italian Opera Troupes,' which not being well remunerated for their outrages upon the ear of the Old World, are wending their way into the very wildernesses of the New, under the name of 'Fashionable Music,' causing fathers and mothers, uncles and grandmothers, to grieve for the days of 'Auld Lang Syne.' "But although subject to the caprices of fashion, and the dis- tortions of mimicry, music, in its pure nature, is neither clouded nor destroyed. And while in cities great numbers are imposed   I   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MINDS.   145   upon by pretenders of science, and are annoying their neighbors with an uproar of keys, and a succession of shrieks; and the in- habitants of remote villages are paying for the privilege of being fashionably martyred, the otherwise educated, the learned and re- fined, indulge in the pldasures of the more ancient and simple style. And it is not uncommon in the mansions of peers, and in the palaces of kings, for the voice of the father to be heard in concert with the notes of the daughter, in some favorite and well remem- bered air. " Those who will take the trouble to trace the history of ancient music, will find that it was in its highest state of perfection in the eleventh century before the Christian era, when we are told, that 'kings and princes vied with each other in the pleasures of song.' We are also informed, that about this time, 'the advantages of power, and the distinctions of wealth, put forth their claims with .unwonted vehemence, and ambition and covetousness took posses- sion of the minds, even of the bard and of the songster; and the sound of the dulcimer gave place to the clarion of war. For two thousand years, music was suffered to slumber, and continued to decline, until it was lost in comparison with riches and honors. But though suffering from slight, and too heavenly for earth, it could not die. It was immortal even among mortals. With the sons and daughters of Italy it revived, and in the warmth of their nur- ture, it swelled with notes so exquisitely sweet, -that all Europe be- came enamored of its charms. Devotion to its cause became an honorable calling, in which pleasure became delight, and delight ecstasy.' Hence the Italian Opera, where extravagance finds ex- cuse in its passion for the science of sounds.  "But it is not to be supposed, that the style of an opera sing- er is any more suitable for the imitation of a young lady seated at her piano in her father's parlor, than would be the mimicry of the airs of the Queen of Tragedy, on finding a key out of tune. Theatrical performances are not patterns far private life, evenin sunny * taly. Nothing can be sweeter than Italian music, as practised in their private abodes. The sweet low voice of the Italian girl in a canzonet, is delicious, and the lively ariette makes us joyful from vely sympathy. Those whom some of our rude performers profess to imitate, are refined in the very sentiment of music. The Ital- ian lady plays and sings for her lover, who listens with his finger on his lip, in token of silence to the passer-by. ' The tones of his   "6       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, lady-love were too low for other ear than his own, and the words that she sang, were full of sweet meaning. (' The practice of music with women, is regarded as an accom- plishment or an attraction, for it only amuses them, while it fasci- nates men. Those who are in the habit of hearing public singers, may have observed, that the man sings with actual feeling, and is often wrapt in his own melody, while tb woman shows a con- sciousness that she is acting for effect on thers. The audience is marked by the same peculiarity. The r tle portion not only hear,; but inhale the tones, and all their pulsations beat in harmony. The females hear and admire. No woman has ever yet been able to compose a soul-stirring strain. The inspiration is in the mind of man, from  whence the emanation- flows,-echoed by the female voice, it enchants and bewilders. In whatever light we consider music, we find it a matter of interest; and from the high estimation in which it is now held-. vocal and instrumental-we have reason to believe that it will attain a still more elevated rank among the sciences; and again, as an art, be in full possession of all the charms ascribed to it by the sacred historian. With unaffected music are associated pure and delicate pleasures; and there are but few minds which can- not appraise it through every grade of its excellence, from the ' lul- laby,' which soothes the almost unconscious infant, to the seraph tones of the angelic choir." "Your ideas on musical effect," said Mrs. Carlisle, ' are cer- tainly new, and worthy of attention." " Their newness," answered Mr. Seabright, "only lies in the expression of certain sensations. Many influences are felt, in a way, for which definition in words is yet to be made; but the heart of every singer, and of every listener, is a voucher for the accuracy of my observations." "We see much of the harmony of 'design in this parallel," said Amy, " and, for myself, I am beginning to think that there must be an unchangeable difference in some of the natural ten- dencies of the minds of men and women, and that things are not so very far from being right, even as they now are.

Amy looked so vexed at the turn the conversation d talen, that Mr. Seabright thought it time to conciliate. "I have, said he, " seen much to admire in the industrious habits and ready alternatives of women, which bear so favorable a comparison with the same qualities in my own sex, that I will try to regain the favor whichI did, just now, fear was beginning to recede, by mak- ing these endowments the subject--of the THRTEENTH PARALLEL. Genius and habits of industry-"That it should ever have become degrading to labor with the hands, is-truly marvellous, since the character of the Deity Himself is founded on His visible  works. We believe in the existence of a God the more readily, because our eyes can see the wondrous things he has made, and  admire their adaptation to our comfort and convenience. So ex-  clusive are we in praise of the excellence of the workmanship, that we deny the possibility of our God having co-workers; and the magnitude of the univese is held up as an evidence of the  magnitude of the One Great Power. And yet, how may, who profess to be filled with admiration of the works of the Creator, would sooner suffer the most acute privations than put their hands  to useful toil. Some there are whocan live at their ease, and yet  'fare sumptuously every day.' Their exemption from labor may be goodfottune, in all appearance; but itis an evasion ofthe penalty pronouinced on all mankind, and which, to avoid, too often biings the more enduring penance of a thankless heart. "We read that'God made man in his own image? Some say in his' moral imageonly. Be that as it may, He made him  with hands, and placed him in a garden, which ignified thathis hands were designed for employment. After the fall, when bh was driven out of Eden, and compelled to dig a more stubborn  soil, the punishment was not in the labor but in the hardship at- tending it. "It may not, in the present advanced state of the world, be  required of every man to dig the earth, or even to be engaged in some mechanical employment; our wants, real or imaginary, beig so various as to require other efforts than those of manual X : a:b.    But it is not a shame, and should be deemed highly honorable for every man to be found capable of providing for himself by means of his hands alone; and he whose business it is to till the ground, or to fabricate an article for comfort, convenience, or ornament, is equally respectable, if merit deserve respect, with him who expounds the law. Children, who, in their heavenly innocence know no dis tinctions of caste, do not play ' kings' and ' queens,' but gardener, mechanics, and housewives. The young boy asks for implementsof industry, and wields them with the good-will of an apprentice. The little girl tends her doll, makes its clothes, washes and ar- ranges her miniature tea-set; and endeavors to show herself a good housekeeper. These things are not always done in imitation of papa and mamma; for, perhaps, all papa's practical skill lies in a game of chess; and mamma is a fine lady, unacquainted with any household occupation. But the child, like the bee, has an in- stinctive love of labor, which early manifests itself in the use of the hands. '"The virtuous of those, whose inheritance is poverty, are sel- dom without resources for the full exercise of their industry and their ingenuity. They seek out means, and in the appropriation of them, defy the common vicissitudes, which are often more appal- ling to the hearts of the apparently prosperous and wealthy than to the diligent and necessitous. The safety and comfort of the industrious poor, whether artisan, mechanic, tradesman, husband- man, or mariner, shows the wisdom of being self-provided with means and habits against adversity; and our common necessities make it evident, that every human creature of adult age should be acquainted with some occupation, which, like a 'friend in need,' will answer to the summons of distress; and afford relief in the day when riches have taken wings, and friendships of interest be- come dissolved. We -can place no dependence upon what we have, but we can rely upon what we are; and since the mutabi- lity of fortune is such that no one can say, 'I shall never want bread,' every one should be able to say,' I can earn my bread.'

"It is not to be doubted that women are not only more active, but more inclined to that class of expedients which procures im- mediate relief; than men,-who are governed by predilections and adhere to particular biases; although, in this, when action is im- perative there seems to be a wise provision of nature, since it is from their singleness of purpose that they are prone to excel in      their vocations or callings, and are enabled to brlng about achieve- merits of immense value to themselves and to the public; yet if they fail in the one grand pursuit, they are, too often, left helpless and hopeless; while women, whose tendencies are more diffuse, having acquired some knowledge of many devices, can make trial of the one and of the other with equal facility until they find something available. They have a love for the needle, and for all the little accomplishments of female handicraft, which, in them- selves, are considered a pastime until other resources fail,-when they are found able to win the wheaten loaf, and bring the needed vestment," We thanked Mr. Seabright for his kind commendation of us in his treatmert of this subject; and Mrs. Carlisle remarked, that she felt it an acknowledgment of some merit in her former at- tempts to rescue herself from extreme want. "Perhaps," added she, " our versatility of genius, and readiness to accommodate our efforts to our necessities, are among the provisions of nature con- ferred on us, who, as you observed in your discourse on education, are not ' arbiters of our own destinies.'" "Such are my views," said Mr. Seabright, " and even in this manifestation of regard for our general happiness, I find cause to admire the wisdom and goodness of the Creator."  Of this ac- knowledgment we all signified our approbation. And Amy asked, if there were not something in reserve on the subject of 'Syi- pathy"' "You have given us so much pleasure in your last remarks," said Mrs. Carlisle, " that I am afraid we shall experience some   THE PURE PLEASURE S OF PURE MNDS.     151 little vexation, if, in your impartial consideration of the next sub- ject we do not find ourselves flattered." , If the treatment of this matter of ' sympathy' devolve on me," said Mr. Seabright, "I believe I shall be obliged to divide the flattery between you and ourselves. But unqualified praise will not be the result of an investigation of our motives, and our manner of doing good to others." - "We doubtless," said Mrs. Carlisle, "deserve reprehension, even in the preformance of our most meritorious acts." "There is no reprehension for you," replied Mrl. Seabright, "awe take that to ourselves. But in making comparisons I may wound your pride, if you take but a partial view of the elements of your owninatures. And here, allow me to observe, in evidence of our wiser course, that while women feel every allusion to any of their mental incompetencies as an injustice and a reproach, we, of the other sex, make our defects subjects of conversation, sometimes with sorrow, and sometimes with ridicule." In charity with each other, and with all the world, we com- mended ourselves to the care of Him who seeth in darkness, and separated for the night. FOURTEENTH   PARALLEL, Sympathies.-'"In that sphere of usefulness which extends but little beyond the demands of domestic solicitudes, man seems to have been designed for counsel--woman for charity. When an appeal is made to the understanding of a man, he is flattered by an acknowledgment of his superior judgment, and fearful of lessening the impression in his favor. He also feels responsible for the effect of his opinions; and, therefore, coolly draws, all his rea- son to the subject, and gives his sentiments according to his con- victions, whether erroneous or otherwise, with calmness and preci- 5I' sion; making the case, in a measure, his own. But when a com- munication of importance is made to a woman, if it involve a shade of ambiguity, ideas so various crowd upon her mind, that she loses a distinct perception of the subject, and makes a multi- tude of remarks without giving any advice at all; and, perhaps, may imprudently mention the affair to a friend, if for no other reason but to obtain clearer .views of the matter. From this ;  anxiety to know the opinion of others in confirmation of her own, has come the vile proverb, that ' a woman cannot keep a secret. c;    152       CHARACTERS UNVEIIEn; OR, "It is from absorption in their own immediate concerns, and from the infirequency of being consulted on subjects foreign to their own interests, that women do not prepare their minds for a ready apprehension of the difficulties of others. This shows no deficiency of intellect, as those who are acquainted with their own resources, and take account of the business transactions of their families, are often less fallible than their husbands in their views of domestic policy. But an appeal to a woman should always be open and direct; for being habitually, or, perhaps, naturally in- clined to act from impulse rather than from deliberation, she con- sults others to shorten the delay, when she cannot proceed with an immediate certainty of doing right. It is from this cause that she finds it easier to give alms than to give advice, Necessity has a language too plain to be misunderstood, and too touching to fall unheeded on woman's ear, for which it seems to have been ex- pressly designed. If she be kind and generous-which, of course, she is always expected to be, she either gives or refuses in a con- soling manner-never annoying the suppliant with scruples and surmises; for, to give pain to others, lessens her satisfaction in do- ing them good. "'With men it is otherwise. They view their private charities as dead loss, not being always at liberty to add them to the stock of their reputation; and this may serve as a reason why the de- mands of poor relations are, above all others, so annoying, and so often disregarded. Men ask deep, searching, pointed, and unne- cessary questions; and, too often, after having probed to the very quick, withhold their aid, or, even if they dogive relief they scowl on their pittance, so that the recipient departs under a sense of in- jury rather than with a heart warmed with gratitude. ("A wealthy man once made a remark in my hearing of this sort: 't assisted Mr. L. when he was in great distress; and, since that time, he is careful to avoid me, so that I do not know how he is getting on. The truth was plain to me, and I promptly asked,' In reliev- ing Mr. L., did you -not say something to wound his feelings? Does not some unkind word rankle? Or, if he is still in difficulty, does not the fear of reproach drive him from you?' ' Why,' said the conscience-stricken giver, 'I am afraid I did not oblige him in so kind a manner as I might have done. One becomes annoyed and fretted by the frequent demands upon his charity.' ' But,' I asked, ' is not the privilege of possessing the means of doing good more than a counterbalance for the annoyance occasioned by the   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      153 humble requests of the unfortunate' ' It is, indeed,' he replied, 'and should be so considered.' Nothing more was said on the subject; but he looked serious, and, I thought, sorrowful. Sud- denly, as if some new idea had struck him, he took up his hat and went out. I afterwards had the pleasure of learning that he went, that same afternoon, to the man whom he had assisted so ungra- ciously, and offered him his friendship, with such pecuniary aid as i   might relieve him from his embarrassments. A lucrative employ- ment was procured for Mr. L.; and after a fewyears he was pros- pering in business on his own account. I "I do not know whether this gentleman had other proteges i;  than the Mr. L., above mentioned; but I do know, that there is an oasis in the most sterile heart: but the hearts of the rich are so often shrouded in their own privileges, that the green and fer- tile spot is only known to themselves when discovered by surprise. "A woman is not likely to be avoided by those whom she has assisted, for as she loves to do good, so she loves those who are the objects of her kindness.    I am   grieved to say that there are some exceptions to the character, which I have drawn as general. But the deficiency falls into insignificance, when com- pared withthe larger number of the other sex who are free from  the selfishness I have pointed out, whose hearts are alive to sym- pathy, and whose means are dedicated to the amelioration of human suffering."  [Here closed the Parallels.] ! "On my own part," said Mr. Seabright, "I have, in discussing these Parallels, aimed at the controverted points of equality of mind, capacity for learning, moral and mental dignity, and the practical influence and usefulness of the male and female world,   separately, and in connection. And the interests of the one and of the other being equally dear to me, I have endeavored to treat -  the pretensions of each with impartiality; for in every view, how- ever darkened by human weakness, I have found traits which en- dear to my soul, my-brothers and sisters of the one great family of mankind; and believing, as I do, that nothing can be radically wrong, as it comes from the hand of the Creator, I would glorify Him in all his works, and feel that praise only was due to what- ever He had made, were it not that sin had marred the perfect    design which blest the earth but for a short season,.in the persons ?:qua i .   154       CHARACTERS UNVEITTED; OR, of our unfortunate first parents. Still, there is so much to admire, so much for which to be grateful, and so much of true enjoyment in our social relations, that I would, on all occasions, gladly confine my remarks to eulogy. But the result of long-continued obser- vation, reading and experience, is the conviction, that as virtue has its limit on earth, praise must have its limit also." We had much conversation during the evening, on the happi- ness we felt in the society of each other. "It is only the absence of Mr. Lysander," said Mrs. Carlisle, " that brings me a moment of regret. Were he but here, our little household community would be perfect in number." We all made similar remarks, and with equal sincerity. But the moment I had spoken, I thought of my father, and so suddenly lost all control over my feelings, that I burst into tears, without the power of making the cause of my sorrow understood. Mr. Seabright came and took my hand; "My -child," he kindly asked, " has any thing been said to wound your feelings?" I shook my head, but could not answer. The sympathies of all the family were crowded upon me, but their kindness only made me weep the more. I did not leave my room the next morning, but received every attention from those dear friends with whom my judicious father had placed me. Sweet Sarah took my distress so to heart, that I felt it a duty to compose myself, for her sake, if not for my own. In the afternoon, Amy came to my chamber, saying, "Dear cou- sin, I know my uncle Seabright wants to see you. He has eaten nothing to-day, and he walks the floor, and looks very sad. He is so tender-hearted!" "Tell him," said I, " that I am coming down in the evening, to play his favorite air." Away she ran with the message, clap- ping her hands, and exclaiming, "Uncle Seabright will be so happy." In the evening I took my place at the tea-table. Mr. Sea- bright bestowed on me the kindest attention, and when I went to the piano, he placed the music before me, and tried to listen; but I soon discovered that he was inclined to conversation. The fam- ily likewise observed it, and politely withdrew their attention. He immediately began to make inquiries about mv father, as if he had divined the cause of my late uneasiness. I owned my grief for our separation. The good old man appeared to be much aft fected, and tried- to comfort me by saying, "He will soon return, you may be assured of it." He then asked me to describe his   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      165 pelson, his manners, his pursuit, and his age. I proudly said, "He has a fine person, and heis gentlemanly, and courteous, and learned, --a true Philadelphian." In my vivacity on the subject of my father's merits, I was run- ning on with an enthusiasm quite new to me, when he smiled a curious, an incredulous smile. "And so," said he, "you would infer that courtesy and learning abound more in your native city than elsewhere."  I answered that I might be mistaken, but I had become impressed with the idea, that in no other part of the coun- try, or even of the world, could be found a class of men so devot- ed to literary pursuits, independent of a living.; "Perhaps you are right," said he. "I shall visit that city. But you 'have not yet told me how old a man your father is." I replied, "He is fifty-four, I believe; and I think he resem- bles yourself in his manner of conversation, but he does not look like you, excepting his hands, which are equally delicate and well forimed as your own."   "But otherwise," said Mr. Seabright, you think my personal appearance would not compare favorably with his X, I feared to offend against his self-love, and said, by way of apology, "He  is your junior by a few years. But you do not, in your ways, appear like a  very old man.  Your ideas are as free from imbecility or confusion, and your voice, if not quite so clear, has no more of the tremulousness of age than his." "All that," said Mr. Seabright, "comes from  the faculty which bachelors ac- quire over other men,--that of keeping off some of the marks of old age. We do not so soon lay by the necessity of making our- selves agreeable. But we cannot modulate our wrinkles, and so nature has given us a  covering with which we can patially hide The conversation now became   general, but I coul d not avoid reflecting upon the loss I had sustained, in avoiding the instruc- tion of my dear father. The evening, however, closed with an un- usual degree of satisfaction; and having learned to look to God for support and comfort, I commended myself, and my too lately revered parent, to His keeping, and with my arms around the never-offending Sarah, I fell asleep.   156        CHARACTERs UNVFTM,-p ; OR, CHAPTER XVI II. Increasing illness of Mr. Preble--Return of Lysander -Great manifestations of joy-lIn. troduction to Mr. Seabright-His account of his absence-His visit to the Penobscot Indians-Mr. Seabright's admiration of the Indian character-Indian superstition- Lysander promises to read an interesting story, TIE weather had now become extremely cold, and the health of Mr. Preble suffered much in consequence; but as he seemed fond of being near Mrs. Carlisle, he was assisted down stairs daily. Here he would either lie on a sofa, or sit in an arm-chair-always pleasant, but sudden gleams of mental anguish would sometimes cross his brow, and tell that he was not always happy. Mr. Sea- bright- was careful in the extreme to attend to all his little comforts, and to keep his mind engaged, either in conversation, reading, or music, of which he was extremely fond, and in which I was, at all times, happy to indulge him. Mr. Seabright kept a watchful eye on the manner of Mrs. Carlisle toward Mr. Preble. He seemed pained at the least appearance of neglect, and for every kind attention he gave her a look of approval and gratitude. How dear an inter- esting invalid becomes to a household! Mr. Preble was not an  annoyance, neither an incumbrance, but a trust and a treasure. Our greatest happiness was in doing something to serve, or to soothe him, and his faintest smile was a precious recompense. 'One evening, after a very stormy day,-the snow still falling, and the winds still blowing, we heard a sudden rap at the door, and the next moment, Mr. Lysander was standing in our midst, shaking a volume of snow from his greatcoat, without regard to its effect on the place or the people. And such a burst of joy!- such a cry of " glad," " glad," and " where have you been " Mr. Preble forgot his helplessness, and left his chair to embrace him; but Mr. Seabright, unwilling that he should come in contact with snowy garments, drew him back. Mr. Lysander, on seeing such a specimen of the "olden time," interposing between him and his   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      158 friend, began a retreat backward. "It is only our uncle Seabright," said Willie. "It is our dear uncle, whom  you will love very much," said Amy.   "And that is he!" exclaimed Lysander. "Well, I thought it was the-resurrection of Antiquity!"  Mr.- Seabright smiled, and retiring to the farmost part of the room, left us to finish our congratulations. After Mr. Lysander had been served with a cup of tea, and other refreshments, of which he appeared to be much in need, he arose friom the table, saying, "Now I am ready to give an account of myself; but first tell me, have I not improved very much .- Have I not put off the 'Poor Scholar,' the pale student, for the healthful and uncouth savage?" "Oh, no, no!" cried we all, " you appear healthful, but not savage." "Let me," said Mrs. Carlisle, "make you, my dear Lysander, acquainted with my brother, Mr. Seabight." Lysander came up in a most equivocal way, and said, with considerable emphasis, "In consideration of your friendship for Mr. Preble, and for the sake of your relationship to Mrs. Carlisle, I make you welcome to all the hospitalities of our house." "I am   most happy, Mr. Lysander," said Mr. Seabright, " to make your acquaintance, and am not without the hope of increas- ing your regard on my own account." Lysander was pleased with the cordiality of his manner, and gave him, also, his other hand, which Mr. Seabright pressed warmly, and bade him " welcome home." "We are impatient to hear you confess yourself," said Mrs. Carlisle. "Where have you been? and why have you played truant so long ." "In the first place, or-rather in the last place, I have been to Bangor, away downrin the State of Maine, and beyond that. I have been to Old Town, or Orono, as it is now called, studying the human nature of the Penobscot Indians." There was a merry laugh, in which even Mr. Preble joined. "It is of no use to laugh," said Mr. Lysander, "'for I assure you that these savages are the right sort of people to show a man the rude simplicity with which he was born. "I went first to Saratoga, determined to make a decided dash into society, but I found there was but one popular course for making an impression, and for that I was not prepared. If I at- tempted to play the beau, and enlist the attention of some fair lady, I invariably found myself forestalled by one of those pieces   158        CHARACTERS UNVETLED; OR, of whiskered impudence that are found -about watering places, for the purpose of fortune-hunting. My rusticity, although it did not forbid many encouraging smiles from the ladies, rendered me in- visible to the more practised in gallantry of my own sex, who would take the arm of my companion for a promenade, even while, she was listening to the preliminaries which I was going through, on the benefits of exercise, before I asked her to walk. "' As flirtation had no alternative in the way of amusement, I was soon weary of that fashionable resort, and after a few days I left and went to New-York. I thought of my brother in that city, but having something to resent, I did not visit him. One day, in walking round the piers, I espied. a vessel bound for Bangor. I put myself on board, and after a passage of eight days, landed in safety. Finding the people at Bangor too much occupied with their-own affairs to notice an unheralded stranger, and being no nearer to forming an acquaintance with the ladies than admiring a handsome face or a pretty foot in the street, I went to Indian Old Town, where I found the air cool and pleasant, and in the sports of the Indians a healthful exercise, and in their legends a never-failing source of interest. But I must own that I was not particularly partial to their present state of advancement in civili- zation. - It was too much improved for the exercise of that perfect independence which is the noblest characteristic of the American savage, and too far behind the average of civilized society to be quite congenial to our notions of comfort and propriety." "I think, Mr. Lysander," said Willie, "that you mentioned something about legends. Did you commit any of them to paper .al "Only one," said Lysander, " a most touching narrative; and I penned it in the shade of an Indian wigwam, after it had been told me, twice over, by one of the oldest Indians of the tribe. I did intend to remain at Old Town until spring, but found the accommodations for winter not so good as for the summer, when nature is no longer imperative for those comforts which industry and skill alone can supply; and, in' truth, my funds were running low. I will now retire." Willie conducted him to his new apartment; but he came back to thank Mrs. Carlisle and Mr. Preble, and then withdrew for the night.                       , The discourse now turned upon the merits of the aborigines. Mrs. Carlisle, who had formed her estimate of their dispositions   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     159 and character more from the history of Pocahontas, and their first reception of the Pilgrims, than fromn their cruelty in warfare, gave them great credit for the natural endowments of the heart. Mr. Preble " believed them to be a degenerate people, suffering under some severe penance imposed by Providence; and doubted whe- ther enough of enterprise remained among them for their resusci- tation as a distinct people. He believed that the better portion of them would become mixed with the Anglo-American-she would not say whether for the improvement or the deterioration of the latter-and the remainder become Gipsies, or fall into nonentity." Mr. Seabright was enthusiastic in his admiration of their un- bending pride, and of the profoundness of their superstition. "There is," said he, " a superstition which borders on the sublime, and which is nowhere to be found in more glowing radiance than among the legends of the North American Indians. "I was once, during my minority," continued he, "on a visit in one of the Southern States; and in passing an evening at the house of a clergyman, with a few religious friends, the discourse turned upon the danger of neglecting self-examination. A young candidate for the ministry, who was present, drew a most vivid picture of progression in sin, and of sinners as they glide down the stream of life, even sporting with the rippling waves that bear them onward, until, when on the brink of eternity, they suddenly mani- fest a sense of their danger,.and make the final plunge with un- utterable despair. "A few moments of silence followed these remarks, when a young lawyer, a pious man, related the following story as an illus- tration of the character drawn by his friend. "' I was once,' said this speaker, 'standing on the bank of the Niagara river, below the falls, in company with an aged Indian, with whom I had travelled from Iowa. His youth and manhood had been spent in the wilds of Chatauque, from which, in the antumn of life, he had been driven, with all his tribe, to seek an asylum in the far west, He had now yielded to the strong impulse of his heart,-in returning to take a last view of the waters which astonished his childhood, and of the mounds which covered the bones of his warrior forefathers. Although he had long been my companion, and I had become familiar with his language, yet from his superstition, and his frequent expression of hatred of the white people, I felt an awe in his presence, and often a doubt of the up- rightness of his intentions towards myself. On the occasion to   160       CHARACTERS UNWILE ;- OR, which I have alluded, I observed that whenever he cast his eyes upward, he seemed to shudder, and to entertain a supernatural horror of the precipice, yet gazed and trembled as one bound by a charm. "' Feeling a curiosity to know the cause of his extraordinary agitation, I desired him to walk with me, and to inform me of the nature of his distress when standing beneath the cataract. He accompanied me but a few paces, when suddenly turning to- wards the fall, he exclaimed,-"Terrible! terrible! is the fall of Niagara!" Then turning to me, he said, "Yet thinlk not, young white man, that I have fear! No! He that has led his thousands of warriors into the face of a' murderous foe,-he to whom thd tomahawk and the scalping-knife were but the play- things of the bloody hour,-he that has been the terror of the terrible, fear that death should come upon him 8. He then fixed his keen eye upon me, and added, "The white man, the pale coward, sinks to repose when the body is free from danger; but the Indian never suffers the wounded spirit to heal." "'Again, looking upward to the avalanche of waters, he raised his withered hands, and with a vehemence that made me tremble, he cried, ' Thou mighty waters, as well mightest thou attempt to drive away the foul spirit that lurks beneath thy foam, as to im- part bodily fear to an Indian warrior ' "The savage was covered with large drops of perspiration; yet he wrapped his shoulders more closely with his blanket, and shuddered, as he withdrew his eyes from the appalling and billowy sheet. His wild air, on mentioning the spirit of the waters, and his glaring eyes, as with open palms he seemed to forbid the ap- proach of some hideous spectre, so suddenly bewildered my senses, that I almost fancied I saw the object of his dread beneath the foam, which bounded upward as if tossed by an invisible hand. '1 I arose, and attempted to depart; but at the instant, en- countering the full gaze of the excited Indian, I felt myself ar- rested by the look, and quailed before it. Rallying an indignant courage, not wholly free firom superstitious awe, I sternly demanded, lKnowest thou the genius of these waters? Why thus mysteri- ous? Art thou thyself more or less than a man? Why not speak thy meaning ." "' (I had again sat down upon a stone. I was sure that he eyed me maliciously as he came and stood before me. By degrees he   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      161 assumed a calm dignity of manner, and firmness of speech.- "Young man," said he, "I once had a son. I trained him as the panther trains helwhelp--to fear nothing. Already did the ene- mies of our tribe tremble at his name, and hold out to me the calumet of peace, ere he should take my place. - Well might they fear him, from whom the thunders rolled away, in terrible anger, and from whom the lightning shrunk afraid. The spirits of the lakes, jealous of his growing terrors, held a council in yonder waters, and conspired to tempt and to destroy him. The tempter came!-yes, the white man came. We thought him too pitiful to be'an object of fear; but, in compassion, we took him by the hand, and he sat down in our wigwams. He became free in his discourse, while deep cunning was in his heart. He fawned like a dog upon my son, and shid to him, "Go with me to yonder city; thy white brethren wait thy coming. They will give thee gifts, and be thy friends for ever."  My son was deceived; he drank in the fair words of the traitor, and followed his footsteps to places where white men, weak as the silken reed, but crafty as the crooked serpent, seek first to entice, and then to destroy. "'Twice seven times had the moon given its full light to the midnight huntsman, when the son of a race of warriors again stood before us. But his own people knew him not, for his words, once powerful as the roar of the hurricane, were now smooth as the zephyr which scarce ripples the lake, but they were full of poison and death. They were words in favor of the white destroyers of the red men of the forest. He had sold his lands for a tinselled coat; and he brought with him a strong drink which made him stoop and tumble, until he rolled at the feet of the warriors of our nation. Wisdom no longer sat upon his tongue, and derision followed his unmeaning words. The warriors asked, "What stran- ger is this 2"  The women ran behind their wigwams, and looked out upon him with hisses and scorn; and the children went and spat upon his garments; the old men hung their heads,-dumb as justice in the councis of white men. I alone wept. That tear was gall; it fell upon him, and filled his soul with bitterness. "' But loud and joyful was the cry of the war-whoop when he who had become our reproach called together the strong men of our nation, and thus addressed them: "' lHe who listens to -the seducer shall suffer shame; but a voluntary death shall cover his crime, and bring peace to his kin- dred. Come to-morrow, and see me die.'   CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR,                    TEil "'Go,' said I, 'thou art again my son, and we shall meet in that land where the frown of thy spirit shall blast the pale de- ceiver, and banish him to his own place of envyoand torment.' "' The next morning I went, with all my warriors, to the place where the waters from Erie begin to descend with a quick but easy motion. There sat my son in a light bark canoe, naked to the waist, and painted in terrific colors. His head was adorned with feathers from an eagle's wing. In his belt hung the toma- hawk and the scalping-knife, and in his right hand he held the war-club. Chanting his own death-song, he glided along in the stream,-now looking toward the sky, illuminated by the brilliant rays of the rising sun,-and now casting his eyes upon the waters. Onward he moved, like one entering upon some grand career. Upon the shore, the war-cry had sounded,-the war-dance had ended, and the wailing for the dead was ready to begin, when, suddenly, as the victim drew near the brink, and felt himself drawn down by the irresistible force of the mighty cataract, he was seen to bend forward with glaring eyes! What there appeared is seen but of men falling into the grasp of the foul spirit that lurks beneath the waters, for such as have listened to bad counsel. But the voice of the spirit, thundering, in its ven- geance, tells us that the apparition is terrible! My son,-aye, thou trembling, pale-faced listener, my son was brought, by the treachery of thy people, to become weak and cowardly as an affiiighted wo- man! His haughty bearing forsook him; his head turned from side to side, and he looked imploringly toward the shore; he heared the brink, and looked downward; he started from his seat, threw up his clutched hands, and uttered one piercing shriek of agony, as he descended the abyss, and disappeared for ever !" The narrative of Mr. Seabright gave rise to many expressions of pity for the Indians, and of condemnation of the motives from which they had been deceived, and robbed of their, wild inherit- ance; and we fell into the opinion that they were a surprising, but evidently a doomed people. The conversation of this evening had so much excited' our sympathy for the unfortunate red men, that we were willing to put off, for the present, all philosophical disquisitions, and listen to the story of Mr. Lysander. The next day I procured some sacred music. Having a strong   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MINDS,   163   desire to please, in my selections, and seeing that all were desirous of procuring for Mr. Preble every possible gratification, I played more expressly for his pleasure than for my own. I was pleased, yet moved, to hear him say, "How congenial are those solemn sounds !"  His visibly declining health was a melancholy con- templation for us all. But he was calm in the prospect of death, observing, that to him it would be the end of sorrow, and the be- ginning of joy. He rejoiced much in the return of Mr. Lysander, saying, "that it had removed his only source of anxiety, and had filled up the measure of happiness to those who had no grief at heart. Mr. Seabright seemed desirous of removing the melancholy impression which, he feared, the conversation of the previous even- ing had made on our minds, and addressed to Mrs. Carlisle some remarks on the character of Mr. Lysander: "He is much more taciturn and sober-minded to-day than I expected to find him." "He is, perhaps, a little awed by your presence," replied Mrs. Car- lisle.  If that be all," said Mr. Seabright, "his self-esteem will . soon overcome anyrestraint that my presence may put upon him."' ( Why, my dear uncle," cried Amy, "to accuse Mr. Lysander of selfishness !" "Never was there a man so free from self-love," add- ed Willie. "My dear children," said Mr. Seabright, "I did not say 'self- ishness,' nor 'self-love,' but 'self-esteem,'-a most useful and com- mendable trait in the character of any man." "Will you please," said Mrs. Carlisle, "to point out the differ- ence, for I must confess that I have been in the habit of using these terms almost synonymously." "There is, in their meaning," said Mr. Seabright, "a vast dif- ference.  Self-esteem  arises from rectitude of intention; and is compatible with a great degree of self-mistrust, even though it may be conscious of the capability of resistance. It is less annoyed in having done wrong from a good motive, than in having done right from a bad one. It aims at perfection, yet has charity for human frailties, and teaches its possessor to be reconciled to himself, not- withstanding his proneness to err. It seldom upbraids, and never condemns; but is rather satisfied with the disposition to act in a virtuous manner than with any progress in virtue already made. On the other hand, self-love, or selfishness, is fostered by personal gratification, at whatever sacrifice of principle. It is imperious in its demands, and regards every favor as its due. It is confident  164        CHARACTERS UNVEILEPD; OR, in its strength to resist evil, without having any standard of good- ness; and having obtained an advantage, always justifies the mo- tive and the means. It is blinded to the faults of its possessor, except when they operate disadvantageously; it is then severe, and changes for the moment into self-disgust. It exults in the privilege of independence in matters of conscience; and is oftener chagrined at the failure of some ill-devised scheme for an unprin- cipled gratification, than for the indulgence of the improper, per- haps unjust motive, Which prompted it." X Mrs. Carlisle, in the name of all present, acknowledged the  ' obligation of being rightly informed as to the meaning of the two phrases; and Willie begged that he might have the definition of " self-esteem" in writing; and that he might be allowed to re- peat the whole conversation to his " dear friend." In the evening, Mr. Lysander, who said he had been all day in "' honey-moon" with his new apartment, was called upon for the Indian tradition; in which, we hoped for something less reproach- ful to our Christian character than is generally found'in tales con- cerning the Aborigines. Mrs. Carlisle threw a blanket over the great arm-chair, and  placing Mr. Preble in it, with a cushion under his feet, seated her- self close beside him, much to his satisfaction.. Mr. Seabright threw himself back in his chair, folded his arms, and fixed his eyes on the reader with a sort of easy assurance. For the rest of us, we gathered near, ready to laugh or to weep according to the , pleasure or mishap of the poor Indian. But Mr. Lysander felt the  presence and the position of Mr. Seabright. The latter saw it; and with the tact of a man accustomed to the courtesies due to the feelings of a reader or a speaker, restored the self-possession of - i the former by a change of attitude, and a few remarks on the general interest, which every thing connected with Indian suffer- ings and Indian revenge inspired. Mr. Lysander, relieved from his f momentary embarrassment, immediately called our attention to    the story of the Indian.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       165 CHAPTEER XIX. PEOL SUSEP. History of PROL SursE--Great sympathy manifested for the Indians. IN the eastern part of the State of Maine, and in the contiguous part of the British province, New Brunswick, are, at this day, the remnants of two once powerful tribes of Indians--the Penob- scots and the St. John's. The friendship of these Indians, in the early settlement of the provinces, was won by conciliatory ad- vances, and secured by uniform kindness, and a just regard to their habits and th6ir interests. Even to the present time, they continue to enjoy, in a great measure, the luxurious idleness of the savage state, together with many of the comforts, peculiar only to civilized life; and, if it be true that our happiness is increased by the creation and indulgence of new desires, then are these frag- ments of the Penobscots and the St. John's, among the few of their unfortunate race who have been made happier in consequence of the inroads of civilization. The name of St. John's was given by the English settlers to a beautiful liver running through the province of New Brunswick,- to the Indians about its borders, and to a town built on its banks. To this town the Indians of St. John's, together with the Penob- scots, who resided in and about Bangor, on the Penobscot river, brought annually large quantities of furs, and exchanged them with the traders, for cloth, blankets, beads, brooches, and whatever else seemed agreeable to their fancies. The intercourse of the St. Joh's Indians with their white neighbors, had the effect of filling their untutored minds with an undue regard to the ornament, of dress; and without adopting the costume of their European friends, they so far excelled them in the decoration of their peisons, that they came to look upon them-   166        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, selves as the aristocracy of the New World; and upon the new. comers as beings sent to minister to their gratification. The St. John's chief, after duly considering the importance of caste, began to exact tribute from his people; and, to add to his newly ac- quired dignity, at the suggestion of an Engliskh gentleman, he assumed the name of Neptune, to the abandonment of his former cognomen--"Occobison." 'In hunting these Indians became much engaged, and, at par.  ticular seasons, very industrious, in order to supply themselves with foreign merchandise, the possession of which formed their criterion of human grandeur; and as a certain portion of their profits was scrupulously delivered into the hands of their chief, the masses of silver worn by Neptune and his family, would ill accord with the ideas of poverty and destitution usually attached to the Indians of North America, or even with the present poverty of the tribes now under contemplation. It was a Curious sight to see those sons and daughters of the wilderness bedizened with ear-rings, nose-jewels, wrist and ankle clasps, bead-embroidered caps, leggins and mocca- sons, and tunics covered with silver brooches. An English iamily, of the name of Nevers, resided at St. John's. Of the females of this family, the elder daughters of    Neptune learned the art of embroidery in beads and ribbon. To these they added, in Indian taste, the glossy quills of the porcu- pine. The skill and fancies of the' chief's daughters were much   admired, and successfully imitated by the plebeian damsels of their i tribe. Medara, the third and youngest daughter of Neptune, was a beautiful young squaw. Her name, appropriately, signified "The  ! flower of the forest." Content with the most simple covering, she , preferred the playful society of her two little brothers to the vain  glitter of silver-spangled garments. The needle, except for useful purposes, was. her aversion; and when her sisters were proudly displaying their gay apparel, Medara, through fear of a repetition'  of reproachful comparison, would glide from  their presence, or sit close to the ground to hide her plain blue leggins and yellow deer-skin moccasons, unadorned, save by the little feet, which gave beauty and grace to the meanest covering. It was the custom of the Penobscots and the St. John's to visit each other alternately, and spend the summer months to- gether; and their friendship was strongly-cemented by the fre- quent intermarriages which took place during these visits; in one   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PJURE MNDS.     167 of which, some years previous to the date of this story, a sister of Neptune married Soctomo, the chief of the Penobscots. It was in the beginning of June, 17--, when, according to pre- vious arrangements, the St. John's tribe were preparing to visit the Penobscots at Orono, an Indian town in the vicinity of Bangor. It was agreed to leave Medara in the family of Col. Nevers, in the hope, that being left alone, she might turn her attention to the now necessary art of embroidery. Medara, who had thought little of these excursions when she herself made one of the party, was unwilling to remain.  But the command of Neptune was peremptory. On the morning of their departure, when she saw them, all gayly dressed and glittering in the sunbeams, enter their light bark canoes, and with the pomp and hilarity of an armada skim over the waters; when she heard the dipping of their paddles, and their wild and joyous screams as they disappeared from her view, "Ah!" said she, weeping, " all hearts are glad but mine!" The kind family of Col. Nevers employed every art to soothe and comfort her; and, as the sorrows of the young are overcome by kindness, Medara again smiled, and again sought happiness in the love of those around her. She spent much of her time in basket-making, and had one prepared for each of her family on their return. When urged to try her skill on some curious pattern of needle-work, she invariably answered, that the plea- sure of wearing fine things was not worth the trouble of making them. About this time, a friend of Col. Nevers arrived from England, and was retained in his family as an instructor of his children. Medara, at her own request, became a pupil with the others. Her knowledge of the English language, in which she excelled any one in her tribe, enabled her to commence immediately with books. She was soon enabled to read understandingly. Among the studies pursued by the youth of the family, was that of Astrono- my; and Medara, though not one of the class, was a most atten- tive listener. To this child of nature there was now opened a source of most wonderful interest. Her first attempt at written composition, was a " lamentation on the ignorance of her own peo- ple, who knew nothing of the size and form of the earth,-of the distance and magnitude of the sun, moon and stars, and of the ,greatness and goodness of Him who made them all." In October the party returned. Neptune was too happy to   168        CHARACTERS UNgEILED; OR, meet with his daughter, to chide her for neglecting the purpose for which he had left her. He had suffered during his absence, from ill health, and from the want of the kind attentions of this amiable and affectionate child. The winter approached, and the season for hunting commenced. The chief who had always been foremost in the toils, as well as in the diversions of his people, was now confined to his wigwam, by a chronic disease. Medara became his nurse, and the guardian of the two motherless little ones, while her sisters employed their \ time in preparing additional attractions for the next warm season. ; This amiable girl, from a natural quietness and timidity, had usu.  ally served her father in silence. But now that she was constantly with him, and seeing him sick and helpless, and almost deserted  I by others, she uttered a thousand expressions of solicitude and tenderness, which sank deep into the heart of the lonely invalid. He loved to hear the accents of her sweet voice, and to watch her active and graceful motions. As his health improved, they en- tered into familiar conversation, and she communicated to him all that she had learned in the English family. But of all the ac- quirements of the white people, their knowledge of the Great    Spirit, and of His works, were the themes upon which she loved to dwell. Neptune was not an inquisitive man, and possessed no great    share of enterprise,-the most important transactions of his life having been nothing more than the capture of wild animals, the disposal of their skins, the collecting of tribute money, and the purchase of trinkets. He had heard much of the injustice of Eu- ropeans in many parts of the country, toward the Indians, and had associated only ideas of avarice, cruelty and oppression, with the names of all other white men, excepting those at St. John's, towards whom he had never entertained hostile feelings, knowing that it was to their influence, he owed much of his present importance and grandeur. He was aware that they possessed the magic power of written communication with one another; but Medara could not make him believe that they conversed with the sun, and moon, and stars. He said the "Evil Spirit, who was the father of the white people, had told them these things." He then enter- tained her with traditionary accounts of Indian origin. That they descended from the Great Man above, who was the only good spirit, and watched over them in hunting and fishing, and made their hearts strong in battle. He embellished his account with the ex-   "IE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      169 ploits of many a warlike savage, and assured her that all her fore- fathers had been chiefs, and the terror of all the tribes, fiom St. John's to the setting sun. Secluded in a hut in the wood, the presence of Medara was, to her father, as the presence of a ministering angel. She prepared his food, combed his black locks, and tied them with an eel-skin: she spread the skins of wild beasts for him to lie down upon, placing his pipe by his pillow, and covering him with his blanket. When she went out, his eye followed her with satisfaction, and when she came in, he looked upon her with delight. Thus passed the winter, and the spring and the hunters re- turned together. All was animation and gladness. All except Neptune and his three young companions, repaired to the town, to engage in traffic and in pleasure. Often was this little family left, for days and nights, without sympathy, and without protec- tion. They were seldom visited, except by such as came to bring supplies, or when wearied with the bustle and excitement of the day, a party came to dance in the evening beneath the lofty pines. One pleasant morning in June, Medara led her father out to renjoy  the wild scenery of the woods.  Father," said she, as they passed along, "   ignorance dwells with the Indian."  " You must go to St. John's," replied Neptune, "and live with the white people." "With their knowldge," said she, "   how happily I could roam the woods with my father, and build our wigwams in new and pleasant places."  "Go with me to St. John's,"  said the chief. "My i daughter shall there have garments, beautiful as the robes of I   morning."  " Not so," said Medara; "  they would be torn by the bries, and spoiled by the smoke of our hut." a  What does my child wish ?"' said Neptune. "   Speak, and it is here. The '   Flow- er of theforest'   shall be satisfied with the dews of kindness." " Your kindness is enough," said Medara; " but the white people have a treasure of knowledge, which emiches, but never encum- bers its possessor. They have minds which traverse the seas, and know what is beyond them. They measure the sun, they weigh the moon, and search out the p aths of the stars.  They say, ' To- morrow the moon will go before the face of the sun, and make an eclipse, so that we cannot see it clearly ; ' or they says the moon willget behind the earth, and then be itself eclipsed.  The poo r un-. taught Indian cannot foretell these things, he only knows that they all rise in the East, and go down in the West. The white man 8 170       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, puts his thoughts in a book, and they speak to others when he is dead. The thoughts of the Indian die with him. The body of the Indian is very perfect, but the spirit of the white man is more beautiful than that of our race. I cannot separate myself from my people, nor waste my years in useless toil on an outward covering; but I would learn more of the Great Spirit, and find out where he dwells." They had now arrived at the side of a rivulet, and as they sat ; down on its brink, the chief dipped his finger in the water, and let fall a drop upon the hand of his daughter. "Child," said he, " is this hand more refreshed than the other 2X" "Not at all," said the *surprised Medara. "Now," said he, " plunge bo th your hands into  the stream." She obeyed him. "Thus," said the savage, "your two hands represent the red and the white man. All the know-  ledge that can be gained in this life, is but as the drop of water, i which fell from my finger. But at death, all plunge alike into the fountain of truth. In this world, we can only look on the works of the Great Spirit. He would have placed them nearer if he had intended that we should measure them. To us, the stars are but bright specks in the sky, and what benefit do we derive from them but to be amused by their twinkling-?-or, perhaps, some lost  hunter, by observing their places, may be guided in his way. In the absence of the sun and moon, they give a feeble light, but will studying their motions and distances, cause them to shine more brightly? Will a knowledge of the size of the sun and moon dispel the clouds which often hide them  from our view!  Of what use is it to know these things? While the white man is studying an eclipse, which brings no good to him or to his chil- dren, the Indian is hunting the deer; he clothes himself with tile skin, and dries the flesh for food. Which is the wiser of the i two . The daughter was silent, and the chief, as he slowly returned ! to his hut, felt the deepest chagrin that his child should desire a ; knowledge of things beyond the reach of men, and only made known to them by the bad Spirit, whose business it was to seduce mankind, and to open their minds to that which the Great Man above intended they should not know. On returning to their wigwam, they found there an Indian from Penobscot, whom they called Peol Susep.  He was the adopted son of Soctomo, having lost his own parents in childhood. Neptune had always esteemed Peol Susep, for his upright and   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE    MNDS.   171 manly character, but was sometimes annoyed by his untameable aversion to the whole white race. Having  met with him at Ban- gor, the preceding year, he had invited him to pass this sum- mer at St John's, hoping, by these means, to induce him to adopt the follies which he encouraged in his own tribe. Susep was about thirty years of age. His person was a fine sample of Indian symmetry; his manner was haughty and taci- turn. Fond of a life of lonely indolence, he had ,never married. All personal ornaments he despised, not only as unbecoming, but degrading. And such was his contempt of the English, that he learned not a word of their language, adopted none of their cus- toms, and would not trade with them to the amount of an otter skin. He reproached the females of his own tribe, for their imita- tion of those at St John's; while he despised the latter for their neglect of basket-maiking, and their love of gewgaws. But he had a regard for Neptune, as the brother of his foster-mother, yet persisted in calling him, to his great mortification, by his former name "Occobison;" and he had come to warn him   against the white people; to persuade him to abandon them, to throw off his new trappings, and to remove, with all his tribe, beyond the reach of their influence; and his joy was extreme to find him in this se- cluded spot. Neptune welcomed his guest with heartfelt pleasure, knowing that Peol Susep would be willing to share his loneliness. Medara, too, did all she could to oblige him. , But his reserve, at first, caused her to shrink from his acquaintance, and even to serve him with embarrassment. He, however, was a quiet observer of her gentle demeanor, and her modest dress. He was charmed with her kindness to her father and his two little sons.  He soon un- bent his austere brow; and if he did not immediately speak to Medara in the kindest terms, he smiled upon the little. savages, as if to solicit a portion of that love freely bestowed on them  by their sister. But that which interested and flattered him most, was the'attention with which he observed her to listen to his con- versation with her father. He became guarded in his sentiments; and often when he spoke to the ear of Neptune, the words were intended for the ear of Medara.  If she left the hut, his powers of eloquence became incapable of further effort; but life and lan- guage returned with her presence. In a little time, his manner became so gentle, as to banish her timidity; and as she was really glad that her father had a companion, she would tell him   so. / ,   172       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR,   ,- "You shall never leave us, Peol Susep," she would say, " for my father loves you." He would sometimes ask her questions con. cerning the young men of her tribe; and one day, he said to her, ' Medara, do the young Indians ever visit you?" '"Often," she re- plied; "and I am now wishing to see them." "You have a lover among them, I suppose," said Susep, peevishy. Mortified by his remark, she answered, "I only wished to show them that my father has a friend." "I shall not be with him long," said Susep. "When the summer is ended, I shall go to the Canadas, and may 7 never return."  "Do you wish to leave us?" asked Medara. "Surely," he replied. "It is easy to leave a place, where we have none to care for us, and none to love." "; Does no one care for you here? and is there nothing for you to love?" asked Medara, thoughtfully. "No, no one, nothing," returned Peol Susep. This haughty Indian knew that he loved Medara; he also felt that he was beloved by her; but he was proud and jealous, and felt hum- bled by the weakness he could not resist. He therefore deter- mined to leave, and to forget Medara, who scarce suspected that she had any other interest in his stay, than the consideration of her father's need of his society. Neptune exulted in the attachment which he saw rising be- tween Susep and his daughter; and he determined, ere he gave I her in marriage, to compel the stubborn young man to depart  from his savage customs. But nothing was further from the mind  of Susep. He had no idea of marrying at all-yet would he suf- fer the most extreme irritation on the slightest provocation of jea- lousy.  One evening the daughters of Neptune visited their father, and brought with them a party of youth of both sexes. The young men amused themselves with a war-dance, at a distance from the hut; and Neptune and the females sat in a group, watching their movement. Susep, who had strolled into the woods before their arrival, now returned. His eye sought Medara. Where was she? And young Ossawn, an Indian, who had, the day before, returned from Nova Scotia, and called on Neptune an hour afterwards& Where was Ossawn?-he was sure to have come. Enraged, he flew to the wigwam, seized a brand from the embers, and was about to wreak his vengeance on the dwelling of his host, when Medara, who had lain down with the children, saw his movement, and supposing he had taken the brand to look for something, sud- denly rose up before him. "Have you lost any thing, Peol Susep '  I-,.   THE PURE PLEASURES OP PURE MNDS.     173 said she. " Can I find it for you .?" Astonished and confounded, he let fall the weapon of his wrath, and looking at the bewildered girl, said, "I had lost Medara.   I have found her in the right place, and am htappy."   He then went out, and sat down by the side of Neptune, while she again laid herself down, wondering, in- deed, what had happened to Peel Susep. The summer had closed, and it was near the time for the de- parture of Susep; but he found it not so easy to leave Medara. She might marry another; she might marry Ossawn, who Visited them often. This thought made him veryTangqy. One day he sat in the door of the wigwam; for: several hours, without speak- ing. igedara was weaving  some twigs into a basket. The chil- dren were out at play; and Neptune was dozing.  "5Medara will not speakr," thought Susep.  " She isthinkingof Ossawn.u  J e be- gan to rememnber a little wallet that he had given her. It was made ofthe skin of a bat, and she had thought it acuriosity; but fi'om the time of her recei~;ing it, it had dis appeared iosity thrown it away," thought he  "She has '*w- " "he ~I;  does not love                             it to Ossawn.

After accusing her of being unmindful of his pre sence, and tbinkig all the time of Ossiwn, he asked con p.re the trife he had given her, saying, " he wanted to burn it"  Me- dara, who was overwhelnmed with astonishment, had not yet spoken a word; but she now drew from her bosom  the little talisman of ove--the bat-skin  wallet; and with her face covered with one hand, she held it  out to him with the other. It is enough to say, that Peel Susep was no longer jealous of Ossawn. The day was fast approaching when he must bid adieu.

On this evening they walked out together satdo up o e ban k of the favorite rivulet, an d looked  174       CHARACTERS UNVFTTLED;, OR,  upon the rising' moon. "We shall no more look together upon this lovely light," said Medara, " but I shall always remember you with kindness; and should you ever think of me, believe that I never meant to offend you.'  Susep was still silent. His arms were folded on his breast; and he looked upon her as though he heeded not her words. She was troubled at his manner, and said, "You will not leave us in anger, Peol Susep?"He was not angry; but every feeling of pride, of independence, and of mortification for pest unkindness, were in combat with the deep-seated af- fections of his heart. The latter prevailed. But as it is easier for the reader to understand a love-sentiment than for the writer to prescribe a form for the declaration, we will leave that, and the mutual happiness to which it gave rise, only saying, that when they returned to the hut, Medara had forgotten his former un- kindness, and her lover was reconciled to himself. The next morning, Neptune and Susep were seen coming from the woods together, and in earnest conversation. Neptune looked proud and overbearing, while the countenance of Susep was     D marked with depression. But his eye lighted up with pleasure as I - he met the smile of Medara. "There is a condition," said Neptune to his daughter, " to which Susep and yourself will agree. Medara signified her willingness, and he proceeded. "Susep goes to hunt in the woods of Condus-  keag, not to return until he has obtained peltries sufficient, from  their sales, to purchase for himself a suit of red cloth, with silver ! ornaments, to the amount of fifty crowns, and twice that sum to be expended for you in suitable decorations. He shall, moreover, I learn the English language, enough to enable him to transact busi-  ness with the traders. On your part you shall, during his absence, em- broider belts, caps, leggins, and mocassons for him, and for yourself." Medara now began to make objections. "I will do my part," said she; 1" but there is often danger and death in the path of the lone hunter. Susep shall not go but in company with others,    ; though the profit may be less. Of what use will embroidery and silver ornaments be to us?" "They will advance the dignity of the future chief of the Penobscots," replied Neptune.  "The white people will regard Peol Susep when they see his wealth. Pale faces will open their eyes upon him. He will be their equal." "To be equal with the white man," said Medara, "he must fill his mind with the wisdom which makes the pale faces greater than their red brethren.'"You do not know, then," said Neptune, " that   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      175 knowledge, even with themselves, is but second to riches; and that, with all their wisdom, they prefer that in others which the eye can gaze upon and admire. So say I; and let those who love the mysteries of the mind look after them, and be forgotten." Susep afterwards inquired of Medara what this conversation meant; and she informed him of all that she had learned in the family of Colonel Nevers. During her recital he manifested great surprise and doubt. "' When I return," said he, I will see if these things be true; and if we belong to an ignorant people, I for one will try to become more wise." The departure of Susep had been deferred for two months. This was, a happy interval. He had endeavored to learn some- thing of the English language, and spent much time in repeating sentences after Medara. When her father desired him to go to the white people to learn, he said, "With them it is a barbarous tongue; but Medara's :voice makes it pleasant to me. I will learn of her." It was on a cold morning in November, when Susep said to AMedara, "To day I leave you; but when Spring returns I also re- turn." "You give up your comfort and your safety," said she. "It is too much." "I give up nothing," he replied, " but a love of idleness, and I gain the love and companionship of Medara." Yet he smiled sorrowfully as he gave her his parting hand. See- ing that she would speak, yet hesitated, he asked, "Has Medara any request to make ." "I have only to ask," said she, " that you will remember and love me." He seemed almost offended. "Am I so unworthy," said he, "as to be doubted by Medara ." "I do not doubt your sincerity, but my own worth," was her answer. "( Can I, who have felt myself to be the least attractive young squaw of our tribe, be for ever loved by Peol Susep?" "6 If any thought you their inferior, they were fools," said he. "But Medara," he continued, in a low tone, "I should be willing to see you with no friend on earth but myself. You would then be all my own, and could have no pleasure in which I might not be a sharer. Would you be willing to live for me only?"Without even feeling that he was selfish, she mildly answered, "Yes, for you alone, and with you only. The Great Spirit defend you, Peol Susep," said she mournfully.-"Farewell." "Farewell," he replied; and turning his face to the east, he added, "May the rising sun find Medara always ready to catch his earliest beams in the wigwam of Nep- tune. Susep shall rise also in the wilderness, and hail the light which shines on the treasure of his soul."   176       CHARACTERS UNVPTIED; OR,  We shall now, for a while, take leave of Medara, and follow Peol Susep through more than a hundred miles of uncultivated country, where towering pines looked down on other trees, stripped of their foliage, save now and then a hardy oak, whose dying leaves assumed every brilliant hue, as if in mockery of the desolating winds which scattered them at every blast. Let us follow him, clothed in the skins of wild beasts; his implements for cooking, together with his apparatus for hunting, suspended on his shoul- ders by a leathern thong that encircled his forehead. Cheerfully and musicallyhe trudged along over fallen leaves and frozen earth,  kindling a fire at night, and sleeping by it on the ground. The hardness of his bed prevented not the recurrence of, pleasant  i dreams. When he lay down in the evening, and when he arose in the morning, his heart uttered one song of joy,-for Medara was to be the reward of his enterprise. A friend and companion was henceforth to cheer him through life. For her he had aban- doned long-cherished principles,and the indulgence of congenial habits; yet he felt that he had made no sacrifice.        i After a toilsome journey he arrived at the eastern bank of the Penobscot fiver, and crossed over to Bangor. He spent but a day with Soctomo, and his wife Natawny; and then departed for the   M field of his lonely labors, following the winding stream of Con- duskeag until he found a place suited to his purpose. Here he  [ bowed himself to the earth, and invoked the blessing of the Great ! Spirit-for Susep had never been an irreligious man; and in his heart had been implanted the elements of true goodness. His first care was to build a hut-a home for the winter. And all being in readiness for the commencement of his work, we will imagine Susep to have said, "Here shall I earn the only good my heart ever coveted. Here, Medara, I shall be industrious- and happy, for I am laboring for thee. And here, too, shall thy sweet spirit come to gladden mine. Yes, I shall feel thy presence and  L not be alone. The souls that are united dwell together. Absence  i is but as the sleep of the body, while the mind-that everlasting dreamer, never sleeps, but is free to wander at all times in the paths of its spirit partner.' Susep was acquainted with this neighborhood of beaver-dams, :and had, at his leisure, learned the haunts of its most valuable game.  He now exerted himself with so much industry and sagacity, that at the close of January he found himself in posses- sion of as many furs as would be necessary for the fulfilment of   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      1" his contract. An agent of the "St. John's Fur Company" re- sided at Bangor for the purpose of trading with such Indians as returned from the woods in the cold season, and did not choose to make a longer journey. Here Susep intended to dispose of his furs ; and notwithstanding the inclemency of the winter, to take his money and recross the woods to St. John's. Let the reader judge of the feeling with which he performed his last day's labor. We will again draw from imagination, and follow him as he returns to his hut, his back laden with the spoils of hunting. He draws aside the rude curtain, which hangs before the entrance of his dwelling, and playfully looking in, exclaims, "Welcome, Peol Susep.'9 But the illusion vanishes, for the voice is his own, and not that of Medara. He kindles his fire; places on the earth, be- side him, his meal of boiled corn and dried venison; and again attempting to realize the presence of the loved one, he lays a mat of warm furs, and whispers, by way of rehearsal, " sit down with me, Medara. We will eat our -morsel together." Here fancy ceases to respond to his call, and he exclaims, ' Ah! when will Medara sit down in the wigwam of Susep 2"  He draws his hands across his eyes as if to wipe away the phantom which has be- guiled him, and eats his lonely meal. He rises with cheerful- ness; replenishes his fire; adds another knotty branch of the pine by way of illumination; and then sits down upon the carpet he had spread for his love. He draws from a pouch that hangs by his side, the smooth quills of a porcupine he had taken in hunt- ing,-selecting the most beautiful as a present for Medara, he rolls them in a bit of soft bark, and places them under his pillow; and then lays his weary limbs to rest. The fire still blazes in the hunter's wigwam. The huntsman is solacing himself in all the delicious imaginings of one who contem- plates a life of matrimonial felicity. Fancy is pouring her richest stream of delight into the glowing soul of Peol Susep. He counts again, and again, the sum to be realized from the treasures he has gained in the forest. The next morning will see him on his way to the abode of Medara, Soon will she stand before -him,-her robe adorned with a hundred brooches; her wrists and ankles en- circled by broad bands of silver; her necklace of beads, her moc- casons embroidered, and her spiral cap glittering with beadwork, and jewelry and tassels. In contemplating this picture his bosom swells with delight, and he bursts forth into a loud laugh., Such, O love, are the vagaries thou playest with thy votaries; 8*   178       CHARACTERS UNVFT En; OR, but whether the sigh or the laugh reverberate on walls covered with tapestry, or through the rude dwelling wainscoted with the rough bark of hemlock, under thy influence it rises like holy in- cense from the heart. The thoughts of the Indian again wander to the wigwam of Neptune. He thinks on the joy of his beloved on his return. In fancy he sees her bounding lightly to meet him with a scream of gladness. He sees the smile, and the ear bent to catch every word as he recounts to her father his adventures in the forest. He I sees her look of triumph when he displays to that vain chief his  pouch of shining ore. If such was the reverie of Susep, it was free from sin as the dream of an angel. But whatever his meditations might have been, he was aroused from them by the sound of footsteps ap- proaching his habitation; and a moment after a white man ap- peared at his door with the Indian salutation, "Acheea." "Acheea,"  returned the hospitable Peol Susep, and sprang from his bed. The kind Indian took the forlorn stranger to his fireside, warmed and fed him; and in his eager hospitality he frequently repeated, "Welcome, brother, welcome." The white man had been an unfortunate merchant in another part of the country. He had undertaken a hunting excursion, and was unsuccessful even in that. He had taken nothing valuable, and having set out to return from the woods, had lost his way, and must have perished but for the providential discovery of the hut of Susep. The Indian listened to his story, and then informed him 1 of his own success, and of his intended departure the next day; but added, that as the season for hunting would continue yet ! longer, he would leave him in possession of his hut and his ap- paratus, and would remain with him one day to show him how " to catch the beaver, the otter, and the muskrat." The stranger took  him by the hand, thanked him, and called him " good brother ;" but complaining of weariness, the Indian spread out his peltries and prepared a bed for his guest; saying to him, in kind but im- perfect English, "Me wish my brother sleep well." He pitied the wanderer, and sat -by him until he appeared to slumber, then covered him more warmly; and feeling grateful for the opportu- nity of doing good, he cast upon him a look of satisfaction, and with a heart at peace with itself and all the world, he laid himself down, and the sweet sleep of the innocent stole over his senses. What were his dreams8  Was he showing the white man the   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     179 track of the beaver? Was he following the winding Conduskeag towards Bangor? Or was he listening to the voice of Medara? Whatever those dreams might have been, he was aroused from them by the touch of a hand upon his head'; and on open- ing his eyes he saw the white man standing over him. Supposing his guest had not slept well, he asked (and his countenance beamed with a smile), "No sleep, brother?"The words finished with a deep groan, and the soul of the Indian fled to the presence of the Creator. His own hatchet, in the hands of the treacherous stranger, had sunk deep in his forehead; and ere the morning light had shown upon the foul deed, the body of Peol Susep was reduced to a heap of black and shapeless cinders. The next morning the cruel despoiler set fire to the hut, and then proceeded towards Bangor, dragging after him the sledge laden with the property of the unfortunate Peol Susep. As it happened, two Indians, who had been further into the wilderness, had become satisfied with their labors, and were re- turning with their gains towards their settlement, when the smoke that arose from the ruins of Susep's hut attracted their attention; and they joyfully turned their feet in that direction, anticipating the pleasure of meeting with other human beings after their lone and dreary winter. But when they came near, and found in the smoking ruins human bones, they imagined the hut had taken fire while the victim was asleep. But on examining the skull, and find- ing it had been broken by some sharp instrument, they suspected that a murder had been committed. And seeing footprints in the snow, and followed by the impression of a sledge, they immediately went in pursuit; and, on arriving at Bangor, found the white mur- derer bargaining the furs of Peol Susep with the agent of the St. John's Fur Company. On the discovery of his crime he made a full confession; gave the ill-gotten booty into the hands of the Indians to be carried to Soctomo, and was allowed to depart. We will now return to the wigwam of Neptune, where we shall find Medara sitting, with her family, around an evening fire. On her lap lay the garments which she had wrought for herself and for Susep. "They are finished," said she to her father. Nep- tune smiled, and said, "They are very fine ;" and her sistern play- fully inquired, if " she thought Susep would perform his part as well." "I hope," said she, "he will have done it as soon." They were here interrupted by the arrival of Soctomo. He entered the wigwam, removed a skin which had been spread to sit .           180       CHARACTERS UNVETL RE; OR)            I upon, and seated himself upon the naked earth without speaking. This behavior betokened extreme humility and deep sorrow., Neptune and his family likewise humbled themselves in the same manner; and all kept silence until morning. When the first ray of the morning light glimmered in the east, Neptune stood up, and demanded, in a loud voice, "Socto- mo, is my sister, is Natawny dead?" Soctomo then stood up and answered, "Natawny lives, and is well.?' He then raised his hand and pointed to Medara, whose thoughts had, more than once dur- ing the night, wandered from the wife of Soctomo, whom she sup- posed to be the subject of their sorrow, and followed Peol Susep  to the wilderness. Oft did she recall her thoughts, and endeavor to sympathize with her father and her uncle. But now she could no longer doubt that the message of sorrow was for her; yet she rose not, according to Indian custom, neither uttered a word. Her heart was paralyzed. "Speak," said Neptune, "we are ready to hear." Soctomo then said, in a firm voice, "Peol Susep has gone  to the land of Spilits." "The Great Spirit is his father," responded Neptune. Silence now seemed to reign in the wigwam of Nep- tune, until grief had collected all its forces, and then burst forth in such dread and doleful cries as Indians alone have the power of uttering. When these had subsided, Soctomo related all the cir- cumstances connected with the death of Peol Susep. And then followed another effusion of sorrow, heightened by indignation. When the spirit had become weary in the extravagance of grief, Soctomo said to Neptune, "Thou hast many children to stand be- fore thee, and nourish thee with their kindness. I am as a broken reed. The son, who should be my support, whose strength was   ! my pride and my defence, is cut down ere he had climbed to the noon of his days. Give me Medara, she shall be mine in the place of him I have lost. If she cannot defend me fi'om mine enemies, and govern my people when I am gone, she can comfort me in the days of my sorrow, and mourn over the spot where I am laid in death." Neptune, although he loved his child too well, was, never- theless, so touched with the bereavement of Soctomo, that he dared not refuse. "Let her speak for herself," said he. "I will go," said Medara, but she shed no tear, and joined not in the la- mentations that were made for the death of Peol Susep. Soctomo remained at St. John's until the warm weather of spring, and then prepared to go with Medara to Bangor. She had become almost invariably silent,-never mentioned the name of ,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     181 Peol Susep, nor exhibited any audible sign of grief; and when she left the home of her childhood, a gleam of melancholy plea- sure seemed to pass over her countenance. Natawny received them with great joy, and said to Medara, "The son who was given us in our youth is taken away; but thou shalt be the child of our old age; and we will nourish thee, and love thee as our own." To this Medara listened with a kind and grateful look, but she made no reply. The next day, Sotomo in- vited her to go with him to a grove near the'river, to see a hut that had been built by Susep, in which still remained his birch canoe, paddles, bows and arrows, and such other rude implements as he had used in summer, for amusement and subsistence. She accompanied Soctomo and Natawny to the place, and examined every thing with care. She went afterwards each day to the hut, and was often heard, by those who passed that way, repeating, in a low chant, some mournful elegy. One day, being ill in the morning, she delayed her accustomed visit until late in the after- noon, and then, accompanied by Natawnyv, took a circuitous path towards the hut. They had not proceeded far when a white man came out of the wood, crossed the path, and disappeared on the other side. To Medara this-occurrence was an omen of evil. "The white man," said she, "has crossed my path, but I will not turn back. The evil be on me alone. Return to thy dwelling, wife of Soctomo, for danger is near. The pale face betokens death to the Indian. "Natawny entreated to go with her, but Medara refused, and wished to be left alone; she, therefore, returned to Soctomo. Medara wandered and lost her way. Her head became con- fused, and her veins throbbed with feverish heat. Unaccustomed to the path she had taken, she went far from the hut; and coming to the river, went down its bank, and following the tide, which was at its lowest ebb, bathed her head in the waters; then turning towards the shore, she sat down on a large flat rock, and leaning her head against a higher ledge, wept the fist tears she had shed since the death of her lover, and fell asleep. , The full moon arose, and shone brightly upon Medara, who saw not the waters, which were even at her feet. They continued to rise; but her slumber was promoted by their cooling freshness; and she slept on to that rest from which no one awaketh. Meanwhile when Natawny returned to her home, Soctomo went out to seek Medara. He went to the hut, and not finding   182       CHARACTERS UNVEITiED; OR, her there, in his alarm and distress he sent forth a dreadful yell, which was immediately answered by hundreds of Indian voices. They soon assembled, and continued to search for her during the night, making the most mournful lamentations, now in low and wailing sounds, and now in shrill screams and shrieks of despair. An Indian boy, who had gone down the liver in the evening, returned in the morning, and gave information that he had seen Medara bathing in the water, and weeping on the rock; and, at the ebbing of the tide, in the afternoon, her body was found still in an upright posture, and leaning against the ledge. Her feet were under her, after the Indian fashion of sitting; and one arm was thrown over her head, so as partly to conceal her face. Her countenance was that oft a person sleeping under the influence of deep sorrow. The Indians gathered round her, and in all the ve- hemence of their natures, poured forth their sorrow in howlings and imprecations, striking terror to the hearts of the few defence- less white inhabitants. The body was placed in a coffin made of bark, and removed to Indian Old Town, or as it is now called Orono, and there    i buried. Her grave is held sacred, and is often pointed out to strangers by the Penobscot Indians. Upon the rock where she was found, the prints of her feet have been rudely engraved, and around them are inscribed Indian characters, supposed to relate to the death of the unfortunate Susep. The murderer was never arrested. He went down to a place    : near the island of Mount Desert, and settled upon some land be- longing to the Government. - Here he became a thriving farmer, married, and reared a family of promising children; but in the latter part of his life he was haunted by the remembrance of his crime, was afraid to be alone, and, withal, he became addicted to intemperance. In his intoxication he would sometimes indulge in minute details of the murder; and not long before his death, which happened in his eightieth year, he was heard to say, that   he feared not the fi'own of the Almighty, since it could not equal the terrors of his own conscience. And as to future punishment, he wished it might be sufficiently severe to erase from his memory that ever-accusing spectre, the dying smile of Peol Susep. Mr. Lysander showed much tenderness of feeling in the con-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      183 cluding part of the above story, and immediately retired when he had come to the end. AWe were all much affected by the tragedy, which- had changed the bright prospects of the lovers to so sad a reverse. Mrs. Carlisle had great sympathy for the foster-parents of Susep, but believed it to be impossible for them to mourn with the deep and abiding grief that a parent feels for the loss of an own darling son. Mr. Preble observed that he was comforted with the consideration that they were taken away in their purity, and had left a sweet savor to rise from their memories; and that he was grateful to Mr. Lysander for the effort to rescue the merits of Susep and the constancy of Medara from oblivion. Sarah wept without any remark, but Amy denounced the whole course of the white people towards the Indians, from the first discovery of Ame- rica to the present day. Mr. Seabright, who sat leaning over a table, with his eyes shaded by his hand, said he had been shocked by the sudden catastrophe, for which the mind had not been pre- pared by any previous suspicion of harm. But he looked upon it as a case of individual avarice and cruelty, and not of injustice on the part of any community or government. It was one of those occurrences which should teach us to pray, "Lord, deliver us from temptation.", L1        i.   184        CHARACTERS UNVFJTLE D; OR, CHAPTER XX. Mrs. Wilson becomes a "standing guest"--finds great favor with Mr. Seabright-con- fesses herself unhappy-receives comfort-her attachment to Christ Church-is much admired for her good sense. IT must not be supposed that Mrs. Wilson had been neglected for so long a time as I have ceased to mention her. While the weather was favorable she had continued to be our guest, on the Sabbath; but the winter being one of great severity, she did not go from home. We visited her often, comforting her with our kindest consolations of words, the only good she would accept from us. Mr. Lysander went out to see her on the morning after he had read the Indian tragedy; but not returning, neither that day nor the next, Mr. Seabright, taking Willie for a guide, went i in pursuit of him. They found him at the farmer's house, waiting, as he said, for Mrs.,Wilson to come home with him. It seemed that he had made up his mind not to return without her, and she  i as steadily refused to accompany him. At length, through the persuasions of Mr. Seabright,-perhaps more to induce Lysander to go away,--her notions of independence were so far overcome that she consented to visit us the next day, and remain with us for : one week. The next morning Mr. Seabright went in a carriage to bring Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Lysander--" the happiest man in the world" he said he was--" to bring Mrs. Wilson to Mrs. Carlisle's,  where she could enjoy the pleasures of society." Mr. Seabright soon became much interested in the conversa- tion of Mrs. Wilson, and treated her with the most profound re- spect, much to the delight of Mr. Lysander, who sometimes said, that he esteemed sensible and educated people rather according to their humiliation than their merit. It did certainly seem, that in the poverty of Mrs. Wilson lay her strong hold on his regard; and although sometimes abused by her for his good intentions, he was forgiving, and still manifested a disposition to oblige her. She :   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      185 was fond of conversing with Mr. Seabright, and astonished us all by the brilliancy of her intellect. A new impulse was given to her ambition, and she resumed a complacence and dignity of manner, which suffering and neglect had changed into churlish- ness, and became free in her communications with regard to some of the trials that had fallen to her lot; and once confessed her re- gret that poverty and age should have come upon her together, as they involved a source of uneasiness, which took from her the possibility of enjoying the comforts freely offered her by a few friends, who, doubtless, charged the refusal to her pride, not con- sidering the true, and in her opinion, sufficiently apparent cause. She then immediately turned the conversation to another subject, leaving the cause to our own conjecture. If ever Mrs. Wilson made any display of vanity, it was in the proud consciousness of being a native of the good city of Boston, and a communicant in Christ Church, which she still contrived to visit annually, and over the visible decline of which she mourned, as though the sympathy were reciprocal, and often in her lament calling it the "Forsaken Church."  "Well do I remember," said she, " the Sabbath mornings of my childhood, when I listened for the music of 'Christ Church bells!' I had invested all that was sacred, all that was devotional, on God's holy day, in that highly favored sanctuary; and I hastened with feelings of joy to its precincts. I trudged up the aisle, in all the confidence of childish importance, and kneeled in the full belief that my Hea venly Father was observing me from among the rest, and filling my mind with devotion. I took good heed to the exercises, and en- deavored to feel their import; and if I suffered a thought to wan- der, it was to admire the goodly edifice, the aristocratic congrega-t tion, the eloquence of the preacher, and the goodness of God, in allowing so many attractions to be united in making his temple pleasing to his worshippers. Yet, even child as I was, and dazzled by grandeur, I knew that religion was not confined to rank or op- ulence; but I did believe (and I fear that too many of riper years indulge in the same sentiment), that where talent, wealth, and fashion congregated, the devotion must be of a high order, and peculiarly acceptable to the Almighty. The religion of the poor, many of whom   I observed in the obscure seats of the church, I regarded as a mixture of penance for sin, with confi- dence in the pardoning and sustaining mercy of God,--a sort of necessary and commonplace religion, which, if persevered in,   186       CHARACTERS UNVRIIFD; OR, would, through the intercession of Christ, fit them, equally with ourselves, for the kingdom of Heaven. I pitied the condition of the poor of this world, and longed to aid them in their piety, which I considered an amelioration of their hardships; and I felt grateful to the preacher whenever he addressed to them, in a par i ticular manner, a few soothing and encouraging words. I indulged in many improbable decisions as to the amount of good done by the wealthy portion of the congregation, for these their humble fellow- worshippers. Did they all give alms after the manner which Christ had enjoined? Did they give kind words and religious consolations with their alms? Did they pour the oil and the wine. with their own hands? Did they go without pride to visit the sick and the needy, and comfort them, as the rich comfort the rich? My inexperience answered all these questions in 'the affir- mative, and I was satisfied. "In a distant land, years rolled away, and I, during the time, had drank deep of the cup of adversity, and had withdrawn my- self, or been forsaken by the children of affluence. The effect had been to make me humble in those professions which had once been my pride. I had become acquainted with the confiding- trust of the children of sorrow, and had learned to look up to God, as to a father, who pitieth and loveth his afflicted ones on earth. "-When verging towards a second childhood, I again heard the rising and falling notes of 'Christ Church bells!' My heart felt the electric sound, and with the faltering step of age I hur- lied up the well-known aisle, and went, instinctively, to the pew where I had formerly sat. But I found myself among a strange people, who, not knowing whence I came, looked on me as an in- truder, yet gave me ample room. I felt the change that had come over me since I last worshipped there, and a glance was enough to show that a change had come over Christ Church also. I no longer saw the crowded pews, the splendid attire, and the lofty bearing, which formerly gave eclat to this' Church of England,' but a congregation, few in numbers, and, with some exceptions, unpretending in appearance, but all strictly and humbly devotional. So that I consoled myself with the belief that my beloved church was not fallen, spiritually, but renovated. If my pride of outward show was that day mocked and wounded, my cravings for gospel truth were satisfied, for never did I hear a discourse more evangel- ical and sublime.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      187 "During the divine service my mind often reverted to the ad- mired of my early religious associates; and I fancied that the soft winds, breathing through the decayed architecture, might be the sighs of the sleepers in the vaults beneath, murmuring their lone- liness, and vainly essaying to call back the loved ones who had for- saken the 'tombs of their kindred clay, and gone to worship in more costly piles of brick and stone." The low and distant tones, with the melancholy earnestness in which this account was given, so deeply interested Mr. Seabright, that he immediately arose, and taking the withered hand of Mrs. Wilson, passionately said, "You shall not, my dear Mrs. Wilson, be separated from your beloved Church. If it is your desire, you shall be carried there every Sabbath; and when you are dead, I or my executors shall see that your body is placed within its- vaults." "For the fist," said Mrs. Wilson, "I do not so much care,- but can I take your word for the last?." "You shall have my word, or my obligation," said Mr. Sea- bright. , "Then," said Mrs. Wilson, "I am on terms of peace with all the world; and am willing, for the first time, to own a debt of gratitude to man. Ho who at death takes up my mortal remains, and houses and secures them in their natural process of decay--he who takes care of my dust, and puts it in keeping for the resurrec- tion, is more entitled to my acknowledgment of favor, than they who only care to eke out the worn and weary life, which would gladly depart, but for leaving its clay, not only unanointed by the tear of love, but unprovided with a sepulchre." Mr. Lysander looked dissatisfied, and asked Mrs. Wilson, "How it happened, that she, who rejected with haughtiness, and even with anger, the kindest offers of her friends, so readily consented to receive a benefit from a stranger ." 'AIt is," said she, "because of the nature of the proffered ben- efit." "I'would have promised to do the same for you," said Mr. Lysander, "-but I never thought of any thing so frightful." "And was the kind promise so frightful, as you heard it just now from Mr. Seabright 8"   188       CHARACTERS UNVEILTED; OR, "Why, truly," he replied, ^" it sounded well from him, and there was nothing fealrful or repulsive in the manner in which he promised to take care of you, for you had prepared him to make  the offer, by dwelling so eloquently on your connection with, and your preference for Christ Church. But now, really, my dear good friend, how could you expect it to come into my head, to go to you and say, 'Here, Mrs. Wilson, I have got some money, and I intend to keep it to bury you "' " "I hardly expected it of you," said Mrs. Wilson; " and yet I sometimes did wish that you might think of it, and give me as. surance, that a humane disposition should be made of my body at death, for it is a satisfaction to know, that our mortal remains will be treated with tenderness and respect, and be secured from the in- dignities which too often mark the disposal of the bodies of the poor. "I honor you," said Mr. Seabright, 6 for these sentiments, and believe that all flesh, in the image of the Creator, should be given to the earth as a sacred trust, and be guarded from sacrilege with more care than the vessels of silver and gold which stand upon the altar'"  The singular cause of uneasiness under which Mrs. Wilson   I had labored for years, having been discovered, and removed by  i her faith in the promise of Mr. Seabright, she seemed to have great pleasure in conversation; and it was not long before she brought up her favorite theme, the Revolutionary War, in which   her immediate ancestor had taken a distinguished part. "And now, my dear Mrs. Wilson," said Mr. Lysander, "you  are just where I like to find you, in the midst of the Revolution. Your anecdotes are full of the pith and marrow of patriotism, and your familiarity with names and, dates always reminds me of a  t good chronological table." A long conversation followed between Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Seabright. After the former had retired, Mr. Lysander said to the : latter, "I feel that I have conferred a favor in bringing Mrs. Wil- son'to your acquaintance." "My dear fellow, I certainly feel that you have," said Mr. Seabiight, smiling, and bowing his acknow- ledgments to Mr. Lysander.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.        189 CHAPTER XXI.

A FEW evenings after this most interesting scene, as we sat con- versing on indifferent subjects, Barney came in with a very wry look, and approaching Mrs. Carlisle, said, "An if you plase, Madam, but Biddy would like to spake to ve a minit." I accompanied MNIs. Carlisle to the kitchen, where we found Biddy, sitting up, with a demure and bride-like appearance, by the side of a sturdy young Irishman. "An sure," says Biddy, " here's Riley O'Dennis come over from  the ould counthry, an the five pounds was me own that fetched him over the sais; an sure I've the right to marry him the morrow, an I choose." Mrs. Carlisle made sorme kind inquiries respecting the manner in which they intended to begin the married life. "An sure," says Biddy, "it's poverty that we're used to; an the love of me husband will be more than me mate an me dhrink." Biddy had been' a good girl, and Mrs. Carlisle, after paying her wages, told her that if she should at any time be in want of a sit- uation, she would be pleased to take her back. The young bride resented the insinuation against her husband elect, and they went away that same evening. We returned to the parlor with the tidings of the approaching nuptials of Biddy, regretting that she had slighted the growing partialitJy of the worthy man Barney, and commenting on the with- ering prospects of a union where love and poverty formed the principal ingredients. Amy was a little censorious in herremarks on the poorer classes of people, the Irish more especially, who en- tered in early youth, and without regard to consequences, into the matrimonial connection.   190        CHARACTERS UNVEITD ; OR, "Imprudent marriages," said Mr. Seabright, "are not con- fined to the humblest walks of life. They predominate most ill that sphere, where cheap works of fiction suit the mediocrity of the purse, and the limited leisure for reading. It is with this class, more than with the higher, in whom love is superseded by ambition,-or the servile, who usually come together as bearers of each other's burdens-that imagination strews the path of matri- mony with flowers; and they, too often, hail penury as the strong- est cement of two loving hearts.   But experience sometimes teaches them that the poverty of romance and the poverty of re-  ality, are very different in their application. The first, such as pre- sents itself to lovers before an imprudent marriage, fills the mind with luscious sentiments; the last fills the body with hungry pains. They then plead the blindness of love, as an excuse for their folly." "And may we not lay our most consummate follies to the blindness of love?" asked poor Mr. Preble, with a voice trembling, and his whole frame in a state of agitation. "Love," said Mr. Seabright, "is not blind to the faults or fail- ings of its object, but it is wilfully partial; and in its partiality, or determination to approve, lies the cause of so much devotedness  before marriage; consequently the weariness attendant on all head- strong efforts with the attainment of the object produces a reac- tion; hence so little forbearance of each other's frailties, and so little i patience under their common trials afterwards."           i "I cannot believe with you," said Mrs. Wilson, "that mediocrity of station is more productive of imprudent marriages than the    ; higher ranks, or the servile. But, in the first, pride conceals many delinquencies; and in the last, fewer proof of harmony are ex-  pected. The true source of the wide-spread calamity may be found in the fact that parents do not enough restrain their children in the choice of associates,-note considering the readiness with which a   youthful fancy, uncontrolled, is mistaken for a noble and enduring sentiment of the heart. And I further hold, that in extreme cases itis the duty of the parents to exercise authority in accordance with their judgment, rather than allow an unwilling consent to a worthless match to be wrung from their doting fondness, and thus make themselves accessory to the misery of those they most love  on earth. I am not certain that the greatest degree of domestic happiness is not found in those countries where the choice is left entirely with the parents."   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      191 it And so," said Mr. Lysander, " you would justify such an out- rage upon the sacred privilege of a free exercise and unbiased ap- propliation of the affections 2"  "I should not consider it an outrage," replied Mrs. Wilson, "to direct, or even to control the decisions of the young and way- ward in matters which involve a life of happiness or misery.". Mr. Lysander now declared himself able to do battle, either in argument or in mortal combat, in favor of the free suffiage of the heart. "And I regret," said he, " that I have no stronger an- tagonist to contend with than Old Mrs. Wilson?" You have a lively imagination, young man," said Mrs. Wil- son, " but I doubt much whether you would not, at fisticuffs, even with me, choose ' the better part of valor ;' and as to your reason- ings, they are, compared to argument, what chicken broth is to ragout." I doubt whether so severe a retort had ever before been made in the family of Mrs. Carlisle; but that lady with great de- licacy and discretion said, "I know of no one who has collected so many just ideas from observation, and can argue from them so well as Mrs. Wilson." At the same time she drew a chair up be- side her, and motioned Mr. Lysander to sit down. Lysander sidled up, as if half glad to find protection, and half ashamed to fly from the contest. "I have," said Mrs. Carlisle, "to ask of you the favor of purchasing a few books for Willie in the morning. His studies are somewhat arduous, and I think his mind wants recreation. What books would you recommend?" Willie, on hearing his name mentioned, had gone over to his grandmother, the better to understand the subject of their con- versation. First, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, by all means," said Mr. Lvsan- der, who entered with great animation into the discourse. "And next, Peter Parley's Tales."' "Will you buy me," said Willie, "an illustrated Crusoe? I should like to see him acting the dancing-master to a class of pussy-cats." Mr. Lysander laughed, and drew the boy caressingly on his knee. Willie, in a playful humor, kissed his forehead, and bit his cheek, and pulled his hair, and then tried to make their eyelids meet, to the amusement of us all, except Mrs. Wilson, who sat up in a most stately manner, and maintained a countenance of great gravity. "Ah! hah!" said Mr. Lysander, "how fruitful is childhood in   192       CHARACTERS UNVMRITf  ; OR, expedients for restoring harmony. How quickly the freaks of a child that we love will drive away ill-humor and discontent. It ever brings us to a sense of our faults towards our superiors, and warms our hearts with a desire for reconciliation." He then left his seat and went to Mrs. Wilson, saying, "I am not angry with you now, good Mrs. Wilson, and I do most sincerely confess my- self ashamed, and beg pardon for having forgotten, in a moment of irritation, the respect due to your age, and to your virtues; and the tenderness we should feel for you in consideration of the many, and the nature of the afflictions, which have been laid upon you. I will never offend you again." He bowed reverently, and taking her hand, bade her and the company good night. Mr. Seabright looked after him in- a manner expressive of the most grateful admiration. Mrs. Wilson put her handkerchief to her eyes, and seemed inuch affected; and for the sake of saying some- thing kind, I carried a shawl and put it over her shoulders, ob- serving that, as the fire was low, I feared she might be cold. Without removing the handkerchief from her eyes, she felt round for my hand and held it tightly in her own. Amy brought a chair for me and placed it beside her. I sat down, and putting , my arm around her neck, she laid her head on my shoulder and wept like an infant. For the loss of dear relatives tears are as natural to the aged as to the youthful; but, under other circumstances, they bring re- proach to those who witness them. They speak of the destruction of hope,-of the desolation of the affections,-and of the want of countenance and support from those who are in the prime of strength, and in possession of the resources from whence gladness flows into the human heart. A feeling of sympathy for Mrs. Wilson was swelling in every bosom; and Mr. Preble, who I had noticed always appeared to avoid her, now seemed to be foremost in the general solicitude. I had more than once strongly suspected that they were not entire strangers to each other. Mrs. Wilson occupied a part of Mrs. Carlisle's room; and she whispered me that she wished to retire. I went with her, and see- ing her comfortably in bed, I tucked up the clothes and. kissed her cheek, asking her to let me love her. aI feel," said she, " that my heart would be dead to a return. In me the deep fountains of love have been broken up, and their treasure exhausted, but I am sensible of your kindness."   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      193 I returned to the parlor. Those who remained there were sitting close together, and speaking of our aged friend. They re- gretted what had just happened; but. hoped it would lead to a more courteous carriage between those truly worthy people. N The next day Mr. Seabright came to me when I was alone; and commended my attentions to  Mrs. Wilson on the evening previous, and on that morning, for I had breakfasted with her in her room. "Nothing," said he, " is so amiable on the part of young persons as respectful attentions to their seniors; especially to those who have suffered from loss of fortune, or from domestic afflictions." I related to him the little conversation I had with Ms. Wilson on her retiring, and added, that nothing could give me more pleasure than to be able to contribute to her happiness, except, indeed, that I would prefer to give the residue of my days to the comfort and consolation of my own dear father. And seeing in Mr. Seabright an old man, and a kind one, I relieved my over- burdened heart by pouring into his confidence the whole history of my past life; and closed by saying, that -I ha'd almost deter- mined, should not my father return in the spring, to go to a con- vent and seclude myself for ever from the world. "But, my dear Helen," said Mr. Seabright, "you are young and pleasing,-capable of conferring happiness on others, and of enjoying it yourself in its most exquisite refinement. A single 'life, such as must be led in a convent, is, I can assure you, produc- tive of no possitive good; evil may be avoided, but good is not attained. And even without the pale of a cloister a single life is dreary,-without children, without the cares which serve to rivet us to the common interests of society.'9 I replied, "They who marry and rear children, may, for a sea- son, indulge in many hopes and smiles; but they who live single escape the tears which scald the cheeks of unhappy parents." "That is a very strange remark for one so young and inex- perienced," said Mr. Seabright. "If you allude to the case of Mrs. Wilson, which, I hope, may yet bear a different interpreta- tion, you must recollect that it is but an exception. If you add to that the slight, or rather seeming alienation of your father's affections from you, remember that we are the creatures of circum- stances. You were the child of an injudicious system of indul- gence; and at an early period entered upon a course of unre- strained pleasures.

And yet, when you became a giddy and frivolous woman from his own neglect, he expected from you the submission of a dependant, the attention of a nurse, the prudence of a matron, and the wisdom of a philosopher.: "Do not, I pray you,' said I, "accuse my father: he was ever kind; he required but too little. I was a dependant. And who but myself should have been my father's nurse?  And since I was the mistress of his house, was it not right that he should expect of me the prudence of a matron?"9 "Mr. Seabright sat musing for some time; at last he said, "I I have wealth, and to this family, including yourself, it will be de-,  voted. I intend, as soon as we can arrange our domestic affairs,  and place ourselves in a more eligible situation, to reinstate our T worthy household once more in society."            ? "Do not think me ungrateful," I replied, 'when I assure you that I can, never again, be aught but a recluse, except I am led forth into the *orld by the hand of my own father." Mr. Seabright drew up a paper, which he held in his hand, full before his face; but the convulsive movement of his body showed some inward perturbation. As he did not seem inclined to further conversation, I again thanked him for his kind intentions. Having taken his hand he pressed mine warnmly, his face still con- i cealed, and I left the room.                   After a few days of commonplace occurrence, and a careful avoidance of exciting themes of conversation, we were again in the utmost harmony, each trying to excel the other-in little acts of kindness. Mrs. Wilson had, in truth, become " one of us," with the prospect of being a highly-favored one. There was not a heart that would have consented to part with her; and, indeed, she seemed inclined to remain, but desired us not to expect the usual manifestations of gratitude and love for benefits received, or sympathy shown, as those sentiments in her heart were dead to- wards earthly things; and like the" dry bones of the valley," could only live and move at the instance of Almighty power. Mr. Seabright afterwards said to me :"This ambition to mount above the sense of an obligation, and to put out the spark of sym-  pathy, which, like the light of the glow-worm, is intended to bring the isolated into community, is but an effort at self-deception grow- ing out of the infliction of disappointment on a proud heart.

"My dear Mrs. Wilson," said he, "you have been much in the West Indies and in the Southern States: please give us your opinion of the mental capa-  j cities of the slaves. What amount of intelligence have they? and  i to what object do their intellectual pursuits tend?" . "Where they receive evangelical instruction," said Mrs. Wilson,  "they may be called a religious people; but otherwise they are a  superstitious race, and much given to social magic." "And, pray, what are we to understand by'social magic?"' asked Mr. Seabright.  "Whatever amusement is the result of an imaginary intercourse with disembodied spirits," replied Mrs. Wilson, " may be termed  Social Magic; and which is becoming a popular pastime in the Northern and Middle States, under the fascinating terms, ' Fortune- telling," Mesmeric Influences," Spiritual Knockings,' etc. The two last-named being improvements in the vulgar science of witch- craft."  "I believe;' said Mr. Seablight, "that mesmerising and the spiritual knockings of the present day are synonymous with an- cient witchcraft; and that both may be considered as the opera- tions of natural faculties self-discovered and exaggerated. I do not   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       197 believe the 'knockings' to be the work of any other spirit than that which inhabits the body of the pretended medium. Yet I regard these things as being worthy of attention. There may be decep- tion practised in whatever is made manifest to our credulity; yet -the deception may involve principles valuable to science. Of this, ventriloquism is an instance. The ventriloquist formerly supposed himself to be possessed of a devil. The delusion was explained away by the anatomist. But, I think there must be something in- nocently diverting in the charms and obies of the negroes, which, I suppose, constitute the chief interest of that which you call their 'social magic ;' less pretending, to be sure, than our more scientific 6pastime in the Northern and Middle States!"  Mrs. Wilson was too proud to notice the apparent pique of Mr. Seabright, and with a slight augmentation of dignity replied: "The negroes of the Southern States, and, also, those of the West Indies, are unqualified believers in charms and omens; and al- though their belief and their practices are contrary to reason, yet some of them are curious and interesting, Negroes are generally weak in sagacity, but strong in faith; and their superstitions, which are not without system, are implicitly believed in. Doubt- less, much of their pretension, and many of their rites, were brought from Africa with the early captives; and to these they have added such other fancies as may have afforded sport to their imagina- tions, and softened the rigors of captivity. ' In the present enlightened age, ghosts, hobgoblins, and me- lignant witchcraft, are of too gross a character for the tastes even of the colored people; but the more amiable sorceries are in high estimation. Some negroes are supposed by their companions to be endowed with a sort of innate privilege, which protects them against the most cunning of their adversaries; and whatever is at- tained by watchfulness is attributed to the gift. Others are said to have the power of bringing their enemies within the scope of their revenge. But the practice of this art is unpopular. "The females often amuse themselves by practising on their lovers; but the males seldom use art to gain love or friendship, believing that such a course, on their part, is often attended with bad' consequences. I remember a story of a young fellow who became enlamored of' a beautiful slavebelonging to a planter, a few miles distant from the plantation-of his own master. Having no oppor- -tunity to converse with the object of his admiration, but desirous of revealing to her the state of 'his heart, he ventured to make use   198        CHARACTERS UNVFlWTTED; OR, of a charm for that purpose. Accordingly, he sought out a young hazel, and after walking round it with the usual incantations, he felled it, and burned it on the eve of the new moon. The ashes were carefully gathered, moistened with honey, and deposited in a small linen bag. Having prepared the charm, he went in the night time to the spring, from which she daily drew water for the use of the family, and threw it in; supposing, according to his faith, that when she came to draw water in the morning she would distinctly-see his face on the surface, and understand the cause of the apparition; and if she approved his suit would find a way for an interview. "Unfortunately, the very next day the spring was to be cleared out and made deeper; and the overseer, while superintending the operation, discovered the parcel as it was thrown up with the earth from the bottom of the spring. His curiosity, or rather his fears, were excited. A council of the family and neighbors was called, who unanimously declared it to be their conviction, that the girl had made an attempt to poison the water. Circumstances are never wanting to confirm a foul suspicion. It was in vain that the helpless being asserted her innocence. After being severely chas- tised, she was sent into one of the lower districts, and, with a cautious intimation of her character, sold as a field laborer for life. "Having no motive for ambition, no fellowship in any concern, which gives man a superiority over the brute, it is not- strange that men who are slaves should be susceptible, almost to non-resistance, in affairs of the heart, and that to be the object of a 'spell' is flattering to their vanity. They are easily won, and grateful when an effort is made to conciliate their affections." "'I am," said Mr. Seabright, "a decided unbeliever in the  ^ virtues of an 'obi,' but I do have great faith in the charms of some of the black women of the West Indies; and perhaps those of the Southern States are equally gifted. I hope these young ladies will not be disappointed when I inform  them that the art to which I allude consists in nothing more than a kind of soft, cooing noise, which I have observed the young negress to make when an agreeable black fellow was present. It always seemed to proceed from a desire to attract and secure attention, and was a manifes- tation of a bashful and rather pleasing kind of coquetry. The same sound is used by them as a lullaby, and the most refractory infant soon falls asleep under its influence. Perhaps, that seeing   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     199 its effect on infancy, the cunning nurse has been tempted to try its power on ' children of a larger growth.'" "I once," said Mrs. Carlisle, " had an opportunity of witnessing this kind- of enchantment, attended with other curious circum- stances, in a colored girl who was for some time in my service in one of the Southern States. Her attentions were directed towards a fine-looking mulatto man, whom I had engaged to supply me with wood. The girl being my personal attendant, I was never unmindful of her ways. About the time at which the young man was expected to commence his engagement, I noticed that she moved with a noiseless stepabout the room, her ear bent as if to catch the slightest movement, when the sound of a blow from an axe took her off in a twinkling. I looked after her. and observed that at the door she commenced a low cooing, which could not fail to attract the attention of my wood-cutter. He, however, con- tinued to ply the axe without raising his eyes, but his manner showed that he was not unmindful of the presence of an enchant- ress. The girl, after a short prelude, and looking with a quick motion of the head on every side, raised her notes and darted off, moving in a circular orbit around him, at finst to the greatest dis- tance the space of the inclosure would allow, but in every revolu- tion approaching nearer to the centre of attraction, until she finished her circumvolutions, with a slow gliding movement, and her warb- ling ceased. During all this time the man had maintained the ut- most gravity of countenance, and turned not his head; but his eye, without being raised, appeared restless, and his axe fell again and again with little execution, until the girl, apparently without design, stood with the most innocent and demure look befoie him. He then, with an exclamation of surprise, discontinued his attempt at labor, and looked upon her as one would upon a sudden apparition. She, in her turn, was quite surprised at finding him there. A lively conversation ensued, but being of little interest, I retired from the window to muse on an incident so very curious, and so very gravely conducted. When the girl came in, I asked her what she called that exercise?"Why, Missus," said she, ; it's only one of our ways." "I presume this manner of making acquaintance is of a mes- meric character; but I had not an opportunity of witnessing a re- sult, as the girl did not repeat the operation; some friend having, in the course of the day, informed her that the man had a wife and several children.   200        CHARACTERS UNVFITMED; OR, "This girl was said to be 'a great charmer ;' and it may have been so said, with truth, for she was very pretty, and exceedingly graceful in her movements, and her voice had, at all times, a dove- like softness. I afterwards learned that she was a cunning crea- ture, and was in the habit of selling ' kee-chees' to the less gifted of her companions. The kee-kee consists of a mixture of pulver- ized barks, roots, &c., with another indispensable ingredient, suchl as a bit of the clothing, a lock of the hair, or some other trifle that had once belonged to the person to be kee-cheed. The mix- ture is put up in a small parcel, and labelled with characters, de- noting the name of the favorite, a memento of whom it is sworn to contain. The buyer deposits the charm in some place visited by the admired one; and no opportunity is lost of meeting him or her there. The owner of the kee-chee, generally a female, hav- ing been instructed to deport herself in a most kindly way; and if she be at all engaging, is usually pleased with the termination of hervexperiment. But if a failure ensue, it is attributed to some flaw in her manners, or in her personal appearance. The talisman is never at fault. "I doubt whether my girl ever used any other kee-chees for her own benefit than those bestowed on her by nature, improved by art. She seemed to have studied human weakness successfully. When I last heard of her she was engaged in quite a lucrative trade, making capital of the credulity of others." We amused ourselves very much with comparing the selling of kee-chees to the selling of information under the fashionable names of " astrology," " mesmerisingsf' and " spiritual knockings," and I cannot tell which bore off the palm of ridicule, until Mr. Seabright began to question us, and we then found that we each had some favorite superstition. ' "Whenever," said Mr. Seabright, " we feel inclined to ridicule the ignorance and stupidity of the poor Africans, we should re- member that there is -in our natures a tendency to the marvel- lous, which is never entirely eradicated, even by education. We   i know that the wisest among those who pretend that it is possible to account for all phenomena on philosophical principles, are still eager for, and delighted with incidents, the cause of which they cannot understand, and dare not, for their reputation's sake, as- cribe to supernatural agency. I have noticed that such persons are dissatisfied and disappointed when others agree with them in favor of natural causes.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      201 "Among other human inconsistencies is the belief, that there are those of the-ignorant and unenlightened who are in possession of faculties not found in the most deeply learned and wisest of our race. But there have been times when popular superstition has been encouraged by the greatest scholars, and otherwise most ju- dicious men of the age. The delusions with regard to witchcraft alone, which have, at different periods, found favor in enlightened nations, more than confirm my assertion, and warrant me in say- ing, that many innocent persons have not only been condemned by conscientious judges, but that it is possible for many of those victims to have believed themselves guilty, on the supposition that the self-discovered faculties which enabled them to play some mys- terious pranks, were gifts of the ' Evil One.' "Popular superstition unmans the public mind, and renders it a fit receptacle for the most absurd ideas. Under its sway, reason is tossed from her throne, and common sense disregarded. If the delusions be of a religious nature, they are the more enduring in their effects, and mwore liable to be revived; for there is always in them a portion of truth, about which, as a nucleus, hang the ele- ments of persecution,-bigotry and artifice.' These last subside when the zeal of the one is spent, and the double-dealing. of the other exposed; and they leave the tainted truth to redeem its character as best it can. But truth, though clouded by error for a season, still retains its identity, and again forces the world to re- spect it. It is to be feared, however, that the time is far distant when its name shall not be assumed by imposture for the purpose of living on public credulity. "1 The degraded character of the science, or rather, the prac- tice of necromancy, has no weight in bringing the multitude to reason. Certain powers of foresight and second sight are ascribed to certain vulgar individuals; and the community is full of be- lievers in their actual possession of these attributes which, they allow, could not come from a good source, and the civility of the age will not let it be said that they were derived from a bad one. The only argument for these latter-day conjurer is, that as the profound in learning, and the wise in philosophy are not endowed with superhuman knowledge and dexterity, science, by occupying the mind, destroys its intercourse with spirit existences, and that it is only the least improved among mankind as astrologers, clairvoy- ants, knockers, &c., and some of the most sagacious of birds and beasts--as the petrel and the seal, that are allowed to hold com-   202        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, munion with disembodied intelligences. In these cases, the truth, if indeed there be any truth in the connection, is so debased from its associations, that no effort is made by science for its rescue. And the process, although carried on in all its varied phases with un- paralleled assurance, is wholly without the sublimity which is gen- erally attached to profound error. "Genuipe skepticism is less absurd than skeptical belief; but while the former is of rare occurrence, we meet with the latter every day in the guise of dreams, omens, predictions, etc., etc. In an educated community, self-respect requires a constant adhesion to reason, and an avoidance of all that savors of mystery. Yet I once knew two gentlemen, of high intellectual attainments, both connected, professionally, with a university of great reputation, to visit a fortune-teller. One of them informed me of the transac- tion. And when I said to him, 'How was it possible that you     N should have had faith in the foreknowledge of one, whose only endowment was the art of 'imposing on the credulous a' His an- swer betrayed the weakness of the human understanding, and ex- hibited the danger of allowing the attention to be-too much en- grossed by an unworthy object. 'I believe' said he, 6that I had * no faith about it, but I passed her door daily, and the fact of her being a fortune-teller, continually recurred to me, even when en- gaged in my most pressing duties, and the curiosity to know whether she could tell me any thing, at last became so irresistible, that I could not overcome the temptation to go in."'  "I am sorry," said Mrs. Wilson,- "to hear you class dreams with predictions and other et cetera, since they are not the workings of imposition. They assume no disguise, nor attempt to impose upon our waking reason. Yet they clearly show that the body is inhab- ited by a tenant-at-will, a spirit'                 I "A tenant-at-will only for a few hours of the night," said Mr. Seabright, "and then a very incapable one.  The sleep of the body is the darkness of the mind; yet that portion of the mind which we call 'Imagination' never rests, but wanders forth irration- ally, while reason, its guide, is under the dominion of the inert- ness which closes over the- body. Yet dreams are entitled to a de- gree of consideration, from the fact that they are of divife ap- pointment, therefore not without a benevolent design." ,!

WE were one day solicited in behalf of the Home Missionary Society, for aid in sending the Gospel into the new and destitute portions of the Western  country.   The application was made through an aged servant in the ministry, who had labored as a missionary from his youth. He met with a kind reception from Mrs. Carlisle and Mr. Seabright; and Mr. Preble being desirous of his company, he was invited to remain with us during his stay in the neighborhood. Mrs. Carlisle thought it necessary to give Mr. Lysander, who was sometimes inclined to be facetious in the pre- sence of the clergy, a caution with regard to his behavior before this good man. "Why, my dear madam," said Lysander, " it is not necessary to put me on my guard before that venerable saint, for I like him; and you do know that I love to hear, either in public or in private, a discourse from the good, old-fashioned, plain and solemn preach- er, whatever be his education, or however rustic his manners; and I rejoice that such are still to be found, both in the highways and in the byways of the ministry.   But I must confess, that I can scarce choose between a well-bred divine, acting for effect his flow- ery discourse, and an elocution-trained school-boy spouting, 'My name is Norval!" Mrs. Carlisle shook her head. "Now do not think me profane," said Lysander, "for I know it was not the sentiment but the expression that displeases you.

And I am sure that in your presence, and in consequence of the ill health of Mr. Preble, and of the entire occupation of his mind with serious things, that I shall behave in every way to your satisfaction." Full of his good resolution, he went out to welcome, in his own name, Mr. Ludlow, our new guest. The inhabitants of the western wilds could not have been more refreshed by the dews of the Gospel, than were-we with the con- versation of this excellent man. He gave us a history of his mis- sionary labors, and of the satisfaction he had enjoyed, notwith- standing the privations unavoidable in his course of life. "Forty- eight years," said he, "have I lived with no abiding place, yet I have found a home wherever I have found a human habitation." Mrs. Carlisle asked him "i if he did not desire rest, and a corn- petence for his old age 8"His reply was full of eloquence and beauty. "In my younger days," said he, "I wanted a home, and some- thing that I could call my own. But my Divine Master calledme to a wandering life, in humble imitation of his own. I am now grown old, and my ways are confirmed. A stationary life would be uncongenial to my itinerant mind, and wealth a clog to my free and happy spirit, which, whether in the wilderness or in the city, is ready to take wings for that world where the presence of Godshall be my shelter, and his love my wealth." "I have, myself," said Mrs. Carlisle, "been in the Western country, and have collected some very pleasing reminiscences of the lives and labors of those who have been sent out as missionaries; and if it be agreeable to the older part of the company, I should like to relate, for the benefit of these young people, the story of one of these travelling apostles, whom, from the favor with which he was received, I denominated the I Welcome Guest.' The presence of the stranger seemed to have awakened an in-  i terest to whatever pertained to his calling; and every voice was hushed, and every ear attentive to the relation of Mrs. Carlisle. The Welcome Guest.--"Not half a century ago, there lived in the city of New-York a gentleman who inherited a very consider- able fortune from his ancestors. But not content with the amount   TIIE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      205 of his possessions, he entered extensively intc, a mercantile specu- lation. He was unfortunate, and instead of further enriching his coffers, he found them reduced by many thousands. "' Offended with the world because of his disappointment, he collected the remnants of his once noble patrimony, and with his young wife and lovely children, and a few laborers, went far into the Western wilderness, and there, for a comparatively paltry sum, purchased a tract of land, which in a more civilized region would have been considered as a princely domain. There he buried his chagrin in an humble cabin, and tried to fancy himself happier than when surrounded by the refinements of civilized society. By the labors of their own hands and those of their dependents, the family were bountifully supplied with the common necessaries 'of life, while toil rendered their homely fare grateful to the appetite, and their sleep was sound and refreshing. ' If the wife cast a thought towards the sphere they had once occupied and adorned, the husband had but to mention the con- tempt which follows unsuccessful enterprise and fallen fortune, and she blessed the wilderness for shielding them from the prying eye of the proud, and the scorn of the prosperous. Tenderly attached to each other, and doatingly fond of their children, with no opu- lent neighbors to vex them by contrast, and no scheme of aggran- dizement to tempt their ambition, they lived without envy and withbut competition. Disappointment had subdued the gayety of their dispositions; and if they uttered not the joyous notes of the lark, their habitation was the abode of sympathy, and might be compared, in its quietness, to the nest of the dove. "If it be asked, ' Did they bless God in their afflictions?' I answer, No. 'Was their happiness enhanced by religious conso- lations ' Alas! no.  They fled from society under one of those desperate resolves which sometimes come to the rescue of wounded pride; and though they cherished and sustained each other by mu- tual affection, they felt nothing like that resignation which true piety alone affords. They found a  continual effort necessaiy to keep up the appearance of contentment; and though they concealed their repinings from each other, they could not hide from their own hearts that happiness dwelt not where fortitude was necessarily kept on the alert to prevent the intrusions of disgust and despair. "This gentleman, whom   I shall call 'Moreland,' had been educated in the principles of the Protestant Episcopal Church. His parents were strictly pious; and, in his youth, he had been   106       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; Oi n observer of all the outward forms of the Church, which led him m osuppose, rather than to believe, himself to be an heir of glory. Soon fter his mariage he became acquainted with a clique  f infidels.-Philsophers,' theY called themselves. There was ignity and independence in the sound, and he became a Philoso - ]lgmity and 1 ndependence in the suu .dn     . o pher. Wth othershe laughed at his former 'plest-idden' way of le, and shook himself in derision at what he called the ' tamels of the Church/ Hlis wife, who wanted no approbation but that of  her husband, believed that where he ventured, she too might be  safe. In their misfortunes she continued in the same adherence to his will. She respondedto his slightestwish; and flattered him by endeavoring to be his equal, in what she called his magnani- mity. She left her friends without a tear because he shed no tears, and might be affected at the sight of them; and when they arrived at the end'of their desolate journey, and she heard him  resolve to be happy, she resolved to be happy too. Yet, some- times, in their lonely retreat her thoughts turned to the God she  had once woishipped. She remembered the times when heryouth- ful hands were raised in prayer. She ventured to recall the pious instructions of her mother. She, in her turn, had become a mo- ther. She looked upon the children committed to her care and instruction, and-she sighed convulsively. But the opinions of her husband were sacred, and she feared that to differ from him, even in his errors; would be to do him injury.  "' Mr. Moreland was a man of fine feeling, and naturally felt a deep interest in the welfare of his children, whose isolation was de- priving them of the advantages of an education, and of the pi-  vileges of an acquaintance with the institutions, refinements, and general usages of society. And, now, a few years had so improv- ed his condition that he discontinued his labor in the woods and fields, and gave himself up to the society of -his family. But their resources for amusement were few. The mother sometimes entertained tihe children with faiy tales, which delighted their young minds; and scenes of real life, as described by their pa- rents, were to their untutored understandings delightfully Incom- Prehensible. -Some attempts were made in the way of educating them; but with none to emulate, their lessons became burden- some, and their progress discouragang. "Mr. and Mrs. Moreland had, perhaps, from the force of early habit, always so far regarded the Sabbath as to lay aside all secu- lar employment, and put on' aIrn a of gravity not common to the i,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     207  other days of the week. This was often a matter of questioning and curiosity among the children; the parents evasively answering that they set it apart as a day of rest. Yet the father on this day often called to mind his early Sabbaths; the services of the day; the tranquillity of the evening; the chaste conversation of his pa- rents; and their care and watchfulness lest they, or any of their household, should by word or deed profane that holy season. Oh! how often did his soul long to impart to his children the same re- ligious instruction; but he looked upon his wife, and perceiving no answering desire, he waited again and again for 'a more con- venient season! 'I He thought of the Bible-a gift from his mother which he threw into the flames when he became a ' Philosopherr-and his mental anguish was complete. ' Oh!' he silently murmured, ' Oh, for that precious Book of life. Oh! for fortitude to speak of these things to my much neglected family!-for courage to arouse the dormant spark of piety which once existed, which still exists in-the bosom of my beloved wife.' "Thus several years passed away. He became gloomyand un- happy; his wife, also, sharing in his depression. Their love for each other was undiminished; and their tenderness of each other's feelings too refined to admit of a full disclosure of the griefs which were concealed in their true and honest hearts. But they saw their children growing up like heathen around them. They looked upon them with pity and self-reproach, and they turned to each other for consolation; yet no word of conviction or contrition ever escaped their lips. "Meanwhile, other adventurers had settled around them; fa- milies less fastidious in their tastes, and less scrupulous in their moral observances. A great part of the 'Moreland Tract' was parcelled off and sold for farms; and now the axe was heard to resound in every part of the forest. The wild-woods were inter- spersed with rude cottages; and in one place the click of the hammer; and in another, the turn of a mill, gave assurance that' the dominion of man was established. But in that remote, and still savage wild, the sound of the Gospel had never yet been heard. "One Saturday, in November, late in the afternoon, as Mr. Moreland was standing at the door of his cottage, he saw a man on horseback, who, with an air' weary and worn,' was approaching his dwelling. There was something of dignified humility in the    208       CHARACTERS UNVRTEID ; OR, appearance of the stranger, which at once attracted his attention; and he involuntarily stepped forward to meet him. The traveller advanced towards the gate, and Mr.' Moreland, laying his hand on the bridle of his horse, desired him to alight and partake of the comforts of his house. 'I perceive that you are a stranger,' said he. 'I am, was the reply, 'and an humble missionary. May I feel that I am welcome .' Welcome a' said Mr. Moreland, ' a thousand times welcome.  A burst of tears attested his sincerity. They entered the cottage, but the heart of Mr. Moreland was too  a: full for utterance. He bowed to the stranger, and to his wife, and offering him a chair, raised his eyes to heaven in silent thankful-i ness. Mrs. Moreland, surprised at the unusual agitation of her husband, arose, and offering the stranger her hand, said, ' Who are you ' The missionary had now become too much affected to   a reply; but Mr. Moreland answered,' It is a servant of our dear Lord and Master.' Mrs. Moreland knelt before the missionary, laid her i head upon his knees and gave thanks to God. The evening scene needs no description. The astonishment of the children at con-  versation so new, the confessions and thanksgiving of the parents, and the holy joy of the missionary, are registered in Heaven. "The next morning Mr. Moreland sent, for several miles around, to inform the inhabitants that divine service would be performed at his house on that day. An event, so unusual, drew together every human inhabitant of that new and unchristian settlement.  For, true it is, that the preaching of the Gospel is best attended  where it is so little known that false professors have not been able to attach shame to the Christian character. The neighbors came; their curiosity mingled with awe. They listened; they heard 'glad tidings of great joy.' They were willing to be instructed. They invited the preacher to remain with them. He did so; and never was there a happier pastor, or a more truly evangelical flock. "That part of the country is now full of pleasant villages; in one of which stands a little church, erected solely at the expense i of the children of Mr. Moreland. And behind it may be seen a white marble tablet, with this inscription : I Sacred to the memories j of William Moreland, and Julia, his wife, between whom discord never found a place; and whose latter days were a bright example of that piety, without which the most refined and exalted affec-.  tions- fail to give happiness; and in place of which worldly gain  brings no peace to the troubled soul; but which alone can fit us   l! THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      209 for the duties and enjoyments of life; prepare us for the terrors of death, and give us entrance into a blissful immortality.'" Thanks to Mrs. Carlisle came like a shower from every tongue. The account, pleasing in itself, gave to the missionary present confidence in his calling, and exalted him in our view. Mr. Seabright observed, "I doubt not, my good sir, that your own presence has caused many a heart to throb with purb and holy joy.  It-is no wonder that you prefer a life, above all others, cal- culated to diffuse unsullied happiness." "God rewards his servants well," said Mr. Ludlow, and happy are they who are the chosen instruments of his work." 'There is, doubtless," said Mrs. Wilson, "much satisfaction in the life of a laborer in the vineyard of the Lord; but when he sees--and he cannot but see---.the greater number at work in the field of the opposition, he must labor under so painful a sense of his own insufficiency, as often to cause him to carry a bleeding heart into his most prosperous ministrations." "You have well defined our trial," said Mr. Ludlow; " the analysis of which would comprehend every species of sin, even to the longing of our own hearts after the forbidden fruit:" i Do you not find," asked Mr. Seabright, " many impediments from the diversity of opinions, carried into the new settlements by professors of the different denominations of Christians a" None at all in the new portions of the country," answered Mr. Ludlow; "' for before interest and popularity take religion under their charge, a minister of the Gospel is received as a brother and a  teacher alike by all who love the name of the Lord Jesus." w I  have often thought," said Mr. Seabright, "that religion would have more attractions were its doctrines less a subject of dis- pute; and I must say, that the tenets of some of the sects, those upon which they seem to rest their faith, would, if taken literally, bnng the whole system into contempt." "Your censure falls in the wrong place," said Mr. Ludlow. !"You attack the platform as being of unsound material, because you happen to see some extraneous ingredient, either in the ce- ment, or in the coloring. Religion itself is free from error; yet every creed may be said to contain some exceptional ideas, and these are raked out by its opponents, and held up to the world as he leading tenets of the denomination to which they belong."   210       .CHARACTERS UiTEVF3D; OR, "I am not an opposer of religion," said Mr. Seabright, with some warmth, " but I hold that preachers are accountable, in some measure, for the opinions they promulgate to the injury of the good cause. And I further hold that the lives of the pastors of churches, having a direct influence on the morals of society, should be perfect in humility, not following after the gaudy fashions of this world, and in self-denial, not pampering the body with sensual indulgence. In such leaders as these we could safely confide." "Your, remarks," said Mr. Ludlow, " would imply, that the laity, however extravagant and dissolute in their own lives, hold it binding on their ministers to maintain an appearance of mendi- city, and a deportment denoting constant humiliation, expecting, as it were, their own sins to be atoned for by the mortification of their spiritual guides." "The laborer is worthy of his hire," said Mr. Seabright, " and I would not reduce the servants of the Most High to a state of mendicity, although they should not look for their reward in the things of this world. I, however, repel your implied charge against my morality, without resentment, since your calling allows you to reprove others, while the apostolic course which you have chosen for the exercise of the mandate given you, commands my more than ordinary respect; and you would do me a favor by answering some queries which force themselves upon the minds of observers, even of many who are true believers." "I will answer you with such wisdom as is given me," said Mr. Ludlow; " but it is harder to contend with the sophistry of a man learned in the schools of philosophy, and neither embracing nor discarding the truth, than with an open infidel. Yet I am prepared to contend for the cause of my Master; and although I may not always gain a victory, I can never be vanquished." "Why," asked Mr. Seabright, " are not the precepts of the Christian religion so closely adhered to, as are those of the Maho- metan and the Pagan ." "Because," answered Mr. Ludlow, "they are too pure and self-denying for the practice of all who do believe. There are those who cannot escape a conviction of the truth, nor can they cease to approve and  admire, yet only become adepts in gospel theory, and their fidelity is in their theory, and not in their prac- tice, which contrasts strangely with their profession, and leads others to doubt the truth of that which they profess to believe." ' Then, said Mr. Seabright, ' you do not deny that many of   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       2" those who call themselves Christians are, practically, atheists, and you must also allow that some whom we call atheists or deists, are, practically, Christians." "I do admit the truth of both propositions," answered Mr. Ludlow, " but maintain that both the first and the last are excep- tions, so remote as to have no bearing on the reputation of the separate classes to which they belong." "But why," asked Mr. Seabright, " should the character of the infidel writer be jeopardized when he attempts to expose what he believes to be the fallacy of an institution, which cannot purify itself from delinquencies quite as glaring as any to be found on his own side of the question " "The infidel writer," said Mr. Ludlow, "does not put his cha- racter in jeopardy. It comes forth already branded, and thus an- ticipates the award of an adverse tribunal. When religion begins to attract censure, from its haltings, then comes infidelity, without disguise, and seeks to supplant its rival in popular favor. ]But the truth lies on the other side, and never fails to rise in time to con- front and vanquish  its opponent, who, relying on appearance, goes forth only to suffer a defeat. The ' Age of Reason' had never been written had the author been aware that infidelity, in a coun- try having a  knowledge of Christianity, can never become  an established national principle, even for the shortest period, except aided by the frenzy of some aggravated national distress; and he lived to see his own work rejected and cast off, while France, for whose benefit it was written, after the political fermentation had subsided, returned to that devotion of which she had before en- enjoyed the consolations, and without which she was unhappy." "There is then," said Mr. Seabright, " a warning in the con- trast between the sure victory of faith- and the certain discomfi- ture even of the sometimes well-meant efforts of unbelief. But though myself a  professor of the Christian religion, and rejoicing in an humble hope through the  merits of my   Redeemer, yet I cannot bring my  mind to a willingness that any should suffer here or hereafter for a candid expression of opinions,-in opposition to truth they may be, but still the fruits of conviction. Our minds are not all of equal docility; some reject whatever they cannot clearly comprehend, and deny that we are immortal because our beg inning is involved in mystery. To them the circumstances and inequalities of life appear rather as the work of chance than of design. One child comes into the world, and its voice is never   CHARACTERS UNVITT)P; OR,                    TH heard. Another brings with it a full share of life, but utters no sound save the wail of sorrow, and dies ere a' smile has played upon its lips. Another lives to try its supple limbs, and taste the sweets of childish happiness, then comes the blight of death. "Through toil and revel, one becomes a man; his comforts and disquiets every day augmenting; his) opening vision sees unbounded good with its contrasted evil; but all his heart is filled with love of life. Yet he is called away, unknowing why; and must he be removed?-must leave a world of action ere he attains a single object worth a dying thought? "The man of eighty years looks back upon a series of events which, whether of sorrow or of joy, were equally futile, equally evanescent. He seems to say, ' I came here with no motive of my own, without my own concurrence, yet have I acted as incessantly as one under an important contract, but to what intent I cannot say, for I have lived to as little purpose as regards myself as the child that dies upon its mother's bosom. If He that sent me here had no design in thus exposing me to sufferings which bring no reward, and pleasures but to end in age and pain, then is exist- ence a most cruel mockery." "My dear sir," added Mr. Seabright, "I find it necessary to believe in a future state of bliss in order to be happy here. Is my belief, therefore, a merit worthy of salvation, since it is not a matter of choice, but of necessity 8" "Salvation," said Mr. Ludlow, "comes of and rot from belief. But he who attempts to comprehend the motive of his existence is at once confounded. Faith is given him to trust in the wisdom of God, but not to understand his designs, and hope is implanted in his heart to urge him on in the ways of righteousness. The Christian can never believe that he was made in vain, or sent into the world without design on the part of his Creator. He argues thus in favor of his own importance: ' I am an item in some stu- pendous scheme. There is a place for me to fill in a higher sphere; and this world the crucible through which I and all mankind must pass to try our fitness, and prepare us for our never-ending state of being. My reason confirms me in this belief; and my faith brings assurance that the scene which is opening before me, either for weal or woe, will give evidence, that each hour of my life has had an important bearing on my future destiny."' "Thank you," said Mr. Seabright, "my dear sir, many thanks. But do you not think, that to the poor and suffering Christian a   higher state of happiness will be awarded in Heaven than to those believers who have had the good things of this world added to the consolations of faith?" "I should say not," replied Mr. Ludlow, "not if the rich make a right use of their benefits. We dare not question the motive of the Almighty in permitting so much suffering on earth. But, although the trials of the poor often test the faithfulness of those from whom nothing has been withheld, yet their poverty, not being of their own choosing, on what principle should they be rewarded? And it is not to be supposed, that when we arrive in Heaven the contrast of our situations on earth will appear so great as it does while we remain encased in these fretful bodies." "But how do you reconcile the pampering of one class of these 'fretful bodies,' and the augmenting of the miseries of the other, with infinite goodness and mercy ." asked Mr. Seabright. "That there is an extreme of suffering in solitary instances I will allow," answered Mr. Ludlow. "Our Saviour suffered as no man ever did. Others have suffered to the full capacity of their natures. But there is no opposite extreme. Happiness does not fill the corresponding measure. Between the two lies the mass of mankind; and on analyzing the sources from whence they draw their comforts, we shall find that the, apparently, less favored drink in as many pleasures as those who have the first choice in the draught." "I fear," said Mr. Lysander, "that your doctrine, if generally diffused, would put out the last ray of pity from the human heart." "You speak, my young friend," said Mr. Ludlow, "as though all misery springs from want, and all happiness from satiety. And this sentiment pervades the greater part of mankind. But it is as grovelling as it is erroneous." "I know," said Lysander, " that my ideas are all of a grovelling nature,--and not mine alone. Are we not all grovellers 8 Are we nor tangible requirements of the things which nourish the body, and thereby comfort the mind? My dear missionary man, you have learned to live on-too little, which has either made you an advocate for the rich and penurious, or brought you to an undue acquiescence in a state of penury. Your opinions may serve to quiet the consciences of those from whom the sufferers from want have practical illustrations of your doctrines daily. But you are a preacher of the Gospel, and would you convert the poor, say to the rich, 'Give them bread,-give it secretly and kindly, without     214        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, haughtiness, without reproach or dictation,'-and they will bless God for his bounty, and honor you and your proselytes as his mes sengers." "I believe," said Mr. Seabright, "that our reverend friend only intended to show, that a large portion of our happiness or misery is drawn from the tendency of our mental operations, and of the satisfying or unsatisfying nature of the things to which we aspire." "It was thus that I intended to proceed," said Mr. Ludlow, "when I was interrupted by the remarks of this gentleman-for which remarks I thank him. They will have a tendency to bring the good example of the Samaritan oftener into my public and my private discourses, and also to search, if peradventure there be a 'good Samaritan' in my own heart." "I am happy to find," said Mr. Lysander, "that I have not offended you. But I have some opinions that are peculiarly my own, since they are valuable and yet rejected by others. But if our desires constitute the sources of our happiness and our mise- ries, I should be glad to know how to cultivate those of the right class. And I will listen with attention." "Man," said Mr. Ludlow, "is a being full of desires. They are implanted in his nature, and the pursuit of some definite ob- ject is necessary to the health of his mind, which would otherwise become bewildered in the mazes of its own longings. Many of the rich suffer from having all their reasonable wants supplied be- fore they become sufficiently ardent to give value to the possession. The ease with which they possess themselves of all that wealth can procure, robs them of the pleasures which exertion and anti- cipation never fail to give, and satiety fills them with disgust for what they are supposed to enjoy. Happiness in this world, lies ever before us, concealed in some desirable object, and the more necessary and worthy the thing desired, the more pleasure we find in the pursuit, and the greater the difficulties which obstruct our path, and th3 longer the way, the better are we prepared for en. joyment in the possession. It is for this reason that the Christian is happier than the worldly-minded man. The hope of a glorious and immortal inheritance fills his whole mind; and the journey towards it being as lasting as life, he cannot arrive at his treasure until death opens a new scene. His object being exposed to no earthly vicissitude, he has no fear of being disappointed when hs labors are done, and his faith and his happiness increase unto the end."   "This is all very good," said Lysander, "for those who are full of worldly comforts; but it is not addressed to the poor whose bodi- ly wants hinder them from the tranquil pursuit of the happiness to be found only in a future world. They want a religion of im- mediate application,-one that sustains the sinking courage, and enables them to bear the scorn of their fellow-travellers on the way to the New Jerusalem." "Then," answered Mr. Ludlow, "I would say to them, 'Have courage, ye poor and despised Christians, and let your religion stay the crushed and bleeding heart. It is easier for you to keep in the way of salvation, than for the rich who travel beside you, and who are constantly turning to the right and to the left, to salute the gods of this world."   Mr. Ludlow, who was slightly eccentric in his own character, as missionaries generally are, seemed to take Lysander into his es- pecial favor. "I truly admire," said he to Mrs. Carlisle, " the good- ness of his heart, and the purity of his mind. I have never met with a character so entirely original, and yet so free from any thing repulsive. Although he is somewhat volatile, there appears to be no taint in his moral principles. He has good sense, but his judgment is not equal. I should think that some blight in his af- fections had disturbed the equilibrium of his ideas. But I would regard his friendship as an unsullied treasure." The thoughts of Mrs. Carlisle reverted to his friendship for her son, and the consecration of his affections to the memory of her daughter, and her lip quivered as she answered, "I and mine have found it so."  Mr. Ludlow spent a portion of each day with Mr. Preble, who was nearly prostrated by the length and intense cold of the winter. Hie was attended with every care that the united efforts of the house could bestow; but he steadily resisted all our desires to have a physician called in. He spoke but little, yet seemed to have pleasure in the conversation of others, and in hearing the Scriptures read, especially by Sarah and Willie. He was soothed as much by the gentle tones of their voices as by the truths of their reading. He was grateful for our sympathy, yet withheld from us the secret of his sorrow. Mr. Seabright appeared to be in his confidence, and sometimes had long conversations with him    21B       CHARACTERS UNVIETn; n OR, privately, and in a low voice. But delicacy forbade all questions on the subject. He treated Mr. Ludlow with great kindness, and contributed to the object of his mission, in which he seemed to  : take an interest. "I feel" said the missionary, "almost culpable for this sore row which lies at my heart, in prospect of leaving you to-mor- "And why will you not remain with us." asked Mr. Sea- bright. "I promise you a competence, and whatever more you can desire. Why go forth againinto the world, trusting to a Pre- callous mode of existence, even for the common supplies which go to sustain life ." The spider," said Mr. Ludlow, C limbs on a slender thread, and why should I fear to venture on the means which Providence has allotted for my support f'            "Your faith is highly commendable" said Mr. Seabright. "But the poverty of the missionary is proverbial. I know of no calling more liable to occasional sufferings from destitution.  "Poverty," answered Mr. Ludlow, "is not confined to the ap- parently destitute. It is often found lurking in the mansions of the great, with Pride whetting its two sharpest stings--the nees- sity of asking favors, and the inability of cancelling them. "My poverty is but of the common order, and so trifling in its character, that a bit of bread changes it into plenty. My  i heart inclines to remain with you, not for the good things of your approaching, when I shall be called upon to give an account of my work. And I would hear the approbation,-   Well done, thou good and faithful servant."' The next morning was ushered in by prayer, and the read- ing of the Scriptures, after which Mr. Ludlow sang the following h Xn At 3i30t. THOU guide in trouble, friend in sorrow, Thou talisman 'gainst every woe, Let me thy precepts ever follow, -  While through this vale of tears I go. When blest with friends, beset with pleasures, I owned thy worth, believed thee true,     THE PURE PLEASURES   OF PURE MNDS.    217 And now bereft of other treasures, Thou dost my comfort still renew. I envy not, nor hate the oppressors, Who rob of all but life and health; 'll nothing keep from vain possessors, Save only thee, thou mine of wealth, . And should the throng, who deal in slander, Glad to oppress, hurl forth their dart,           j With thee to cheer my soul, I'll wander, With mind serene, with grateful heart.

We all brought forward our parting gifts, and took a tender   ewell of our beloved missionary,--Mr. Lysander accompanying    n on the first day's journey. He seemed to have become much    ached to Mr. Ludlow, and his friendship was returned with a  rmth almost parental. He returned full of the praises of our   erend'friend.

Arrival of a physfcian-Mr. Preblo declines his Psesrip tion s-Person app nc Dr. Dudley--His conversations with Mr. Seabright--Idol gratiflcatton,--indness and commendation of Mr. Seabright. 'MR. SABRIGHTO  believing it to be a duty incumbent upon hi m- self to consult a physician in reg ard . the healt de acquaint-, wrote to a medical gentleman with whom he had made acqua ancein crossing the Atlantic, asking his immediate attention, urg- anite crossing     he, athe high       einion he ing as a reason for prefeng hint t  , andthe  high oinion e had formed of his character during their voyage, and fro his let terse and a desire for a renewal of the acquaintane, personally. They had ept up a correspondence with all the warmthof a friendship founded on similarity of taste, and congeniality of sen- timent. Dr. Dudley immediately answered the summons in per- son;  He took up his lodging at the nearest hotel, but was day pily blended. He soon became a favoiteut   otaltogether  the familiar character of our good missionary.  Wilson, -who was still a proud woman, and often complained of the degeneracy of the manners of the age, compared him to her for- mer acquaintance of Christ Church    I  hpersosy. Mr. Preble would not receive the physician in his profesiona capacity, but only as the friend of Mr. Seabight. r Dudl saw, atonce, that he couldnot be benefited by Tmedical treatment but often diverted tis mind into conversatio, and succeeded  persuading him to partake of those fo little comforts which serve to alleviate the burden of confinement. An unsually nice bunch  THE PURE?LEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     219 grapes, with a short dissertation on the cultivation of the vine, would tempt him to examine, and to partake. An enamelled pot of jelly, or a curiously-shaped bottle, containing ve:y choice wine, would lead to cheerful remarks, and induce him to try their flavor, and he soon fell into a habit of tasting, of his own will, and with- out persuasion, of such nourishment as was placed on the table by his bedside. It was, at last, amusing to hear him, with true invalid simplicity, ask, when any thing new was brought him, "What would Dr. Dudley think of my eating this " -"Does Dr. Dudley know what you are giving me?"Trifling as such incidents may seem, to surviving friends, they possess an interest worth record- ing. I often listened, with much pleasure, to the conversation be- tween Mr. Seabright and Dr. Dudley; and one morning the dis- course turned upon comparison of the Americans with the people of other countries; and I was not a little amused with the following burlesque: "All nations," said Dr. Dudley, "have idol gratifications, to which their general efforts are -made subservient, and which adds a trait, decidedly national, to their more common characters. Thus the Englishman labors with a view to profit and comfort; the Frenchman to profit and pleasure; the Spaniard to profit and dignity; and the American to profit and praise. The Englishman spares neither his conscience nor his reputation in the pursuit of gold, which he fireely spends in the procurement of luxury and ease. The Frenchman will give the hard earnings of the week, to make himself merry with his friends on Sunday. The Span- iard begs a picayune to pay for the hire of a servant; while the American will wake and watch for a 'good chance' in speculation, and then exhaust every resource, in order to become favorably known." "You lay to our charge," said Mr. Seabright, "more vanity than I am willing to acknowledge for myself, or for my country- and yet, we do like to be thought well of, although it is not plea- sant to hear our peculiarities mentioned in so marked a manner." "There is," replied Dr. Dudley, "in America, an ambition to become -distinguished; and it was but natural that her pride should have been stung by ridicule or reproach, while the struggle lasted for an equality with the greater powers of Europe. But the time has passed for this Republic to wince under the charge of petty absurdities, which enter, more or less, into the character of   220       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, all nations. She is already above the reach of the shafts of her  former detractors, and can afford to join in the laugh at her own i notions of importance; and it may be presumed that she will, at no distant period, furnish to the world, other traits of indisputa- ble American origin, more worthy of their attention than her ec-'  centricities."  There were but few subjects which did not pass under their review; and I was always pleased to find in Dr. Dudley a high  appreciation of moral worth, and a just discrimination between  true merit and exalted pretensions-an innocent life and a sancti- fied deportment-real usefulness and pretended philanthropy- sound doctrine and pleasing oratory-statesmanship which bene- fits the public, and that which triumphs only in the-dignity con- ferred by popular favor. I had regarded Mr. Seabright as a high standard of critical excellence, yet, in these conversations, I some-  times thought 'him vanquished. Perhaps the disputes were thus  managed, on his part, in order that I might form a high opinion of his opponent. He asked me one day how I liked the remarks of Dr. Dud-  ley. I answered that I was much pleased with the manner in which he treated every subject. I also made use of many expres- sions of regret that I had not cultivated the acquaintance of my father's associates. I brought to him a volume of the works of Lord Bacon, the whole of which I had taken from the library to my chamber, and had been quietly perusing for the last six months. He immediately commenced a conversation on the merits of that  great author; and I was gratified to find myself able to speak with propriety and understanding. But I could not, at this time, account for the extreme delight which Mr. Seabright expressed. He acknowledged that he should not have put "Bacon" into my hands as the commencement of a general course of reading; but was glad I did not consult him. He remarked, that I must have ; received a better education at school than I myself was aware of , "I am proud of you, my sweet little Tuzzen, " said he, "I am truly proud of you. What a treasure to your father." I certaily  thought his warmth a little extraordinary; but he was a kind- hearted, generous man, and had I had no other parent I could have loved him as such.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     221 CHAPTER- XXV. A fearful disclosure-The consequence-A touching scene---A season of sorrow. THE winter had passed away. The green leaves were beginning to appear upon the trees. Nature would soon be out in -the full robes of spring. But how was the invalid? Failing! failing! day by day. "I fear," said Mrs. Carlisle to Mrs. Wilson, " that the warm weather, from which we had so much to hope for our dear Mr. Preble, will prove unfavorable. I have not seen him since yesterday. Mr. Lysander, and my brother, and the doctor, are all so attentive that I cannot find room to do so much for him as I could wish; and yet, I sometimes think that he feels more inclined to be served by me than by any other person." Mrs. Wilson turned upon her a look of such sorrowful mean- ing that I anticipated an end to all- our hopes of his recovery. She mournfully said, "' The grass of the coming summer will grow upon his grave. And, my friend," continued she, rising and lay- ing her hand on Mrs. Carlisle with admonition and kindness blended in her manner, " you must not let him die thus-unknown to you." Had a thunderbolt from Heaven fallen upon Mrs. Carlisle, she could not sooner have lain prostrate at our feet. Fortunately Mr. Seabright was present, and commanded us to be quiet for the sake of the sick; and with assistance he conveyed Mrs. Carlisle to his' own room, that being the nearest, and laid her on his own bed. Dr: Dudley was in immediate attendance, and pronounced it a case of apoplexy, induced by sudden emotion. But he was appre- hensive of no immediate danger. In Mrs. Carlisle an appearance of returning consciousness would, at one moment, give us a hope to be dispelled by the deep and deathke faintings of the next. v   222       CHARACTERS UNVFEITED; OR, Sarah, who looked to God in every emergency, was on her knees asking for mercy; while Amy, who was more passionate, seemed bursting with suppressed grief. The day wore on, and Willie, Mr. Preble, and Mr. Lysander, had all become acquainted with the illness of Mrs. Carlisle; btlt  the immediate cause was not communicated, except to the physi- cian, and that in my presence, by Mr. Seabright, as I waited by the bedside of the sufferer. But how much was I surprised, how  filled with emotions, joyful, yet fearful, when I learned that he, I whom we had called ' Mr. Preble," was the son of Mrs. Carlisle:--  the loved, the lost, the mourned "William Carlisle." And that Mrs. Wilson was the mother of a woman whom he had called his wife. What a secret had here been kept! And from what terrible cause, had it been kept! Dr. Dudley, though his fortune placed him above the necessity of confining himself to the exercise of his profession, was of high ! standing in the medical faculty; and his skill was seconded by kindness of heart. To his care alone, in the most perfect confi-  dence, was intrusted our precious friend. When an unfavorable, symptom appeared, we appealed to him with looks and words of entreaty, as though life and death were in his Wands; and when our hopes were revived, our gratitude was too often directed to him, more than to our Creator and Preserver. And when, at last,  we felt assured that Mrs. Carlisle was convalescent, we almost re- garded him as the giver of life. He was consulted on the most  safe means of adjusting an interview between the mother and son.  L With the latter he conversed on the subject; and though his dis-  tress on account of her illness was almost too much for his feeble frame, yet he longed for the moment when he should be permitted to hold her to his ieart, and be acknowledged as her son. As Mrs.- Carlisle, in the little conversation in which she was able to indulge at times, made no allusion to the cause of her late attack, we sup- posed that she either retained no recollection of the admonition of Mrs. Wilson, or regarded it as the phantasy of a disordered brain. At length she expressed a wish to visit the chamber of Mr. Pre- ble; and requested that she might be conveyed thither when he . was wrapt in profound sleep. The physician, who seemed to di- vine her meaning, gave him a gentle opiate, soon after which he fell into a sweet and tranquil slumber, in which his countenance appeared to indicate a heart filled with joy. As he lay thus, his cheek resting on one hand beneath it on the pillow, his white fore-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS,      223 head partially shaded by clusters of dark hair; his lips, from which a moustache had been taken, curved into a smile as gentle and soft as that of a sleeping babe; Mrs. Carlisle, leaning on the arm of Mr. Seabright, entered the room. I stood with Dr. Dud- ley on one side the bed of sickness; on the other was placed a chair for this doubting parent. After bending for one moment over the sleeper, she seated herself. The family, at the request of Mr. Seabright, had all assembled in the next room, which was Mrs. Carlisle's own bed-chamber, and which communicated by a door with that of the invalid. The family, with the excep- tion of Mrs. Wilson, were not aware of what might take place; but as soon as Mrs. Carlisle was seated, the door which was at her back was softly opened, and they all stood looking in. Through the perfect stillness I could hear the beating of my own heart. Mrs. Carlisle seemed wrapt in reflections, which she yet feared to indulge lest disappointment should follow. The painful silence was at last broken by looking up to her brother and asking, "Is it he ." "Do you not know him?" said Mr. Seabright. - "Will he wake if I lay my hand on him ." asked she. And she softly drew her chair nearer, and said, as if soliloquizing, "Now that the hair is removed from his face, I think that I see something more of resemblance to my poor William; but the features are larger, and not so delicate in their outline as they should be. True, he was but a boy when I saw him last-only twenty-one. [Here Mr. Lysander, who had understood all her words, came noiselessly in, and stood behind her chair in mute astonishment.] It has, since, been eleven years. Eleven years between, early manhood and middle age works great alterations in the outward appearance. Yet I have seen a resemblance more than once. It must be him- self." She put her fingers near his head, and withdrew them several times. "The hair," said she, " could not have assumed that dark color of itself; yet it may have been dyed to facilitate the disguise, but at the root it will show certain evidence whether it be he or another." Again she put forth, and again withdrew her hand, as if fearing to destroy the last hope by finding the hair of one uniform dark color. Mr. Seabright saw her perplexity, and smiling said, "You can now bear the confirmation that this is, indeed, your son." In saying thus, he put his hand softly upon the temple of the sleeper,   224       CHARAOTERS UNVRILED; OR, and smoothing back the disguised extremities, exposed to view the natural auburn hair of William Carlisle. M1rs. Carlisle bent forward, her face upon that of her son;  while tears of joy fell like a shower upon his cheek. He awoke,  ] and putting his arm around her neck, uttered in a tone--sweeter I than ever before, or ever again can fall upon my ear-"My mother!" William Carlisle was-no more. The body was kept in ice for four I days; and the mother was buried in the same grave with her    , son.  Who can describe our sorrow in these days of our trial? Who 1 could hear Mr. Lysander mourn for her whom he called his bene- factress, and say there was no gratitude or love in the human heart? Who that could hear him say, from the depths of his sorrowing soul, "He was with me, and I knew him not," would  ; doubt the reality of friendship? And poor Mrs. Wilson seemed   i to fear that she had not acted prudently; but Mr. Seabright and  I Dr. Dudley assured her, that she had acted with sufficient caution in so difficult a case. Mr. Seabright was of opinion, that but for i her timely intimation of the character of the stranger, he would have died, as he feared he should, without being known to his mother, He could not be persuaded to make the disclosure him- self; and Mr. Seabright shrunk from the task of mediator, where  the consequence must be overpowering to one, perhaps to both the mother and the son. He was aware that Mr. Preble only waited in the flesh, hoping to be known and acknowledged of his mother. Hie also knew that Mrs. Carlisle had become too sensitive, her heartstrings broken, one after another, until the thread which held on to life was too feeble to bear an excess, either of joy or of sor- row. She was cheerful, but it was the cheerfulness of a subdued heart. "It is over now," said he, " it is over now; but, oh! it was a fearful interview!"  We asked no questions, but our inquiring looks would fain be answered. "Patience, children," said Mr.  Seabright, " with the help of Mr. Lysander, a revelation shall be made at no distant day."  "Mr. Lysander will not be severe on me, I know he will not," said Mrs. Wilson. "I know that I have my infirmities of temper, but my soul is free from guile." "No, my dear madam, my dear firiend," said poor Lysander, i" that I shall not, for I fear that I shall have nobody in this world at last but you, dear good woman, who have borne afflictions like a martyr. But you shall have justice done your memory, and such justice as becomes a saint. But now  tell me, dear Mrs.   THEI PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     225 Wilson, how did you discover the stranger to be William Carlisle? and why did you not tell who he was?" "I knew him," said Mrs. Wilson, " as soon as I saw his face; but your own prudence and knowledge of his affairs will suggest the reason why I felt bound, in tenderness to him, to keep the discovery a secret. I do not think he wished to be known to you, but only to his mother." i"And why not make himself known to me?" said Lysander, with great emotion. "Did he not love me? Did he not know how I would have taken him to my very soul?" "4 Yes, yes, he knew it all," said Mrs. Wilson. "But my dear Lysander, you must not expect that candor from a heart bleeding from contrition, which you find in your own, sound and untroubled as that of a child. And what more could you have done for him if you had known that he was, indeed, your tong-lost friend i" "Oh! but I could have done it better. I would have loved him so." "( William Carlisle," said Mr. Seabright, " could not have borne allusions to the past. He was made comfortable here. He was loved and cherished with the most tender care. The last wish of his heart was gratified. He died in the arms of his mother,-he died happy; and God, in mercy, took the mother with the son. With a full consciousness that she was about to join her beloved family, she sank calmly into the sleep of death. Could we wish it had been otherwise?"' Amy, whose grief, like that of all sanguine persons, was at first violent, had become placid and attentive to the comforts of the family. But Sarah continued not only to mourn, but to look forward to the true and better world, and to withdraw her mind, daily, more and more from the concerns of this. Mr. Seabright had assumed a new responsibility. A family bequeathed to his care by the dying Mrs. Carlisle, to whom, and to whose interests, he seemed as much devoted as she herself had been. He good- naturedly called them "The crowning blessings of his old age." Yet the days came, and the days went, and our bereavement was still talked of in the morning, and again in the evening. Little Willie, who, since our misfortunes, had attached himself more than ever to Mr. Lysander, was becoming emaciated and feeble; and we noticed that he was taking Medicine, which Lysander had procured, by advice of Dr. Dudley, for a cough. But as he did not complain, we felt no great anxiety, especially as his friend   226       CHARACTERS UNTrIEDV ; OR, never lost sight of him, by day nor by night. He had kept him in his own room, which he said was " hallowed by the presence of the divine child ;" and many other extravagant expressions which he was in the habit of using, we set down to the goodness of his heart.  -. i!:: " '                     I,...   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      227 CHAPTER XXVI. Consumption-Care and sympathy of Mr. Seabright-Dr. Dudley a favorite-The mis- apprehension-Disgust--lumiliation-Seclusion-The alarm-The fever-Conva- lescence. ABOUT the last of August our beloved, our darling Sarah, too pure, too spiritual for earth, was taken from us. She had been. my peculiar charge; and although a consumptive patient is some- times said to have an injurious effect on those who are near them, yet she slept, nightly, in my arms, aud nestled her loving head in my bosom. In vain did Mr. Seabright counsel, and even com- mand,--in vain did Dr. Dudley entreat that I should- occupy a separate bed. I would not wound the feelings of the uncon- scious object of my care, by withdrawing myself from her nightly embrace; and although I was aware of the danger, I regarded it rather with satisfaction than with fear; and when my release came I felt like one deprived of a privilege, and longed once more to render some little service, and to meet the smile of grateful affec- :tion in return. In the kindness and solicitude of Mr. Seablight, I might have found a substitute for the care and love of my dear father; but feeling that I did not deserve, and could not accept from another the favor that I had sacrificed in him, I felt his anxiety for my health and comfort a reproach; and so I candidly informed him, begging him, at the same time, not to construe my unwillingness to share, even with Amy, his more than paternal care, to my ingratitude, but to my regret. Mr. Seabright was moved at my constant re- currence to my loss, and at last promised to make an effort to dis- cover my father by writing to persons of his acquaintance in the different ports of Europe, and gave me the strongest assurance that I should soon have news of him.   228       CHARACTERS UNVEIIT D; OR, Dr. Dudley not only visited our family as a physician, but as a friend, a familiar 1wssociate. He was with us constantly, and I was almost imperceptibly led into a fondness for his company. I read such books as he recommended, and endeavored to improve my conversation on such subjects as appeared to interest him; and I saw, with pleasure, that Mr. Seabright was not averse to the inti-  macy which could not escape his observation. But how was I shocked one morning when Mr. Lysander came to congratulate me on the hitherto concealed intelligence of my being "an heiress." Seeing me look incredulous, confounded, and displeased, he said, "It is very strange, and I think inconsistent with your gene- ral character, to pretend unconsciousness of the circumstance; for I had the truth of it from the lips of Mr. Seabright, and in the presence of Dr. Dudley, who seemed to be already aware of the fact." "But that which surprised me most," continued he, " was the information that you inherit the fortune from your father, whom we all supposed to have been utterly ruined at home, and gone abroad in search of adventure." I cannot say whether grief, indignation, or disgust had the greatest influence over my feelings at that moment; but I had the presence of mind to ask of Mr. Lysander, silence on the subject, as I myself should contradict the report to Dr. Dudley, assuring him that it was entirely without foundation. I retired to my room, shocked at that duplicity in another which I had once proposed to practise myself; and which I now began to believe was no rare trait in the human character. But that he to whom I partially owed my present rectitude of intention, was not above the meanness of dissimulation, shook my faith strangely in the moral excellence of the apparently most upright. I began to reflect, that as no engagement existed between Dr. Dudley and myself, there would be a seeming indelicacy in speaking to him on the subject, as it would be conveying the idea that I supposed him to be interested in the truth or untruth of the report. I therefore sought Mrs. Wilson, and making a confidant of her, I desired her to undeceive him immediately, as I feared his attentions were a consequence of the impression that I had a for- tune at my disposal. And I could not keep down a sudden aver- sion which arose out of the suspicion that he was governed in his views concerning me by motives of pecuniary interest; neither could I avoid giving expression to my wounded vanity.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     229 Then am I a blind woman," said Mrs. Wilson, "if Dr. Dud- ley has any motive in his attentions to you, other than that of pure and disinterested love. And you will find that he will rather re- double than withdraw his good opinion, when I have made known to him that you were not a party in the deception. And as to Mr. Seabright  " She stopped here, but her eyes twinkled out something that she did not like to believe, much less to speak. I went from her immediately to the door of Mr. Seabright's room, and tapped as gently as my perturbation of spirit would allow. He opened it and bade me welcome in his usual kind and familiar way, and endeavored to seat himself by me, but I drew back. I did intend to muster all the anger that had ever lodged in my heart, and vent it in upbraidings, but my stock of ill-nature had ever been small, and the manner of Mr. Seabright was not of a sort to increase it on this occasion. He put his hand so kindly, so lovingly on my forehead, that my resentment dissolved into grief and humiliation. Interrupted by sobs, I related the cause of my unhappiness, dwelling in sincerity upon my affliction in the loss of confidence in him, whose word I had ever regarded as im- mutable truth, and whose opinion had been the law of my con- duct. ' But now I know," said I, "that my own dear father would not have acted thus." He listened to me with all the composure and coolness of an innocent man, and then said, "My pretty little tuzzen, suppose I have a mind to give you a fortune myself. Have I not a right to do so .?" "It was cruel," said I, "to allow me to believe myself the ob- ject of attentions which were directed to a fortune, however in- herited." I could say no more. I fled to my chamber. I buried my face in my pillow. I wept with all the earnestness of a break- ing heart; and from what cause? From disappointment, such as I had never known before. I hid myself in my room for more than a week. I could not bear the light of day. I desired only darkness and seclusion. Amy brought me many kind messages from Mr. Seabright, and many inquiries concerning my health from  Dr. Dudley.  She sometimes wept, because she saw me unhappy. 5"My dear Helen," she would say, "I wish I could comfort you; but how can I, not knowing the cause of your trouble? I am sure you would tell me what it is, if it were proper for me to know; and yet, I think you might confide in me.'? I have been very foolish, Amy; and /    230       . CHARACTERS UNVRFlED; OR, I am ashamed to tell you." I once ventured to ask, "How does Mr. Seabright appear.?" "Why, to tell you the truth, cousin," said she, "although he seems kindly disposed toward you, he does not appear, to be at all troubled about this melancholy seclusion of yours, and I do think he is in some way the cause of it. I feel angry when I see him smile at his own thoughts, and look as if some- thing very satisfactory were passing in his mind. But Dr. Dudley is dejected, and talks much with Mrs. Wilson. You seem to be the subject of their discourse; and I think they are both under an unfavorable impression concerning uncle Seabright. But as their conversation does not appear to be designed for my ear, I do not listen, but go away and attend to something else." After Amy left me I thus communed with myself. Dr. Dudley is, doubtless, disappointed in the expectation of a fortune. Per- haps his own is insufficient to support the character of a gentleman. It is well that the perfidy was discovered in time to prevent a consummation, even though Mr. Seabright did intend to give me a dowry; for my happiness would be more endangered by a re- volt of my pride, on finding myself the condition of his receiving money from Mr. Seabright, than by his contempt of my own real poverty. But why should Dr. Dudley be dejected? It was with him only a matter of interest. And why am I dejected? - Why do I hide myself? But having hid myself, how shall I appear again without confusion of face? I wish it were well over : I am sick at heart. Willie came in to see me every day, and pitied his " dear tuz. ;en," and "hoped his dear tuzzen was not angry with any body." And Mr. Lysander, who was sure to follow him, still kept up his indignation at the treatment I had received. In Mr. Lysander were concentrated all the elements which constitute true friend- ship, otherwise I should have recoiled fi'om his sympathy, so know- ing of my weakness. Amy had become my room-mate, and after having been im- mured for eight days, I was awakened one morning by hearing some one call, "O! Amy, Amy!" We were both in a moment qn our way down the stairs, at the bottom of which we met Mr. Seabright. He put his arms around us, and detained us long enough to say, "The girl did wrong to alarm you. But Willie, in attempting to cough, has broken a small blood-vessel." Seeing that we were near to fainting with affright, he led us to a seat, :and pl aing himself between us, he embraced and kissed us both.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PU RE MNDS.     231 "My sweet children," said he, "may God bless you." We clung round his neck. In this overwhelming grief, oh how contemptible did my late unhappiness appear! I saw Dr. Dudley pass into the sick room, and I regarded him as one to whom I had ever been ndifferent. Amy begged that she might see her brother; but Mr. Seabright said, "Not at this moment; he must be kept quiet." She found relief in tears; but I felt strangely oppressed. I thought I heard confused sounds; and then I saw Mrs. Wilson standing before me; and I knew that she was bathing my temples. I also felt that I was supported in the arms of Mr. Seabright, and that Amy was holding my hand and weeping. Yet it did not seem that these things were unusual. But I felt that I was sinking either into sleep or death. I felt no alarm. There was something delicious in my quiet and receding reflections. IWhen consciousness returned, I saw that Mrs. Wilson and a neighbor woman were with me, and that Mr. Seabright was kneeling by my bedside, his face buried in the clothes, and he was seemingly in prayer. I tried to realize what had happened. "She revives again," said the strange woman, as she continued to rub my hands. Mr. Seabright started at the sound, and calling me his "r darling," his "treasure," thanked God, not only with words, but with a flood of tears. I began to suppose that I had had a faint- ing fit; and as Mrs. Wilson, when she saw my lips move, bent her ear, I asked her if I had fallen, as I had hurt my arm. "You have lSeen bled, child," said she, "but keep the arm still, or you may loosen the bandage." And am I really ill?, thought I; and I said, "What sounds were those I heard? Has any thing happened to Willie?"  "Something did happen to Willie," said Mr. Sea- bright, "and you fainted from excess of anxiety. But he is better now, and so is my dear Helen." After kissing my forehead, and calling me by all the tender names that a father could bestow on a beloved daughter, he left me to inquire after dear little Willie. He had ordered that I should be kept quiet; but I wanted to know more. I believe that my mind had been confused from the time that I heard the alarm, all that transpired afterwards seemed so dream-like; and I asked again what had happened? Mrs. Wilson said, that about two o'clock in the morning, Biddy (who had again returned to our family) came softly to her room, and asked her to go down, for -that Willie appeared to be struggling for respiration. She found that his cough had become obstructed, and that he breathed with difficulty; and with Mr. Seabright, the   232       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, doctor, and Mr. Lysander, she remained in his room until after four. He then breathed more freely, and appeared to be falling into a slumber, when a sudden effort to cough was followed by a hemorrhage of the lungs. That it was Biddy who alarmed us; and Mr. Seabright, fearing that we should rush into the room, inter. cepted us, and endeavored to calm our fears, when I, who seemed feeble and bewildered from the first, fainted in his arms, And now, said she, " be quiet for your own sake, and for that of your absent father." I imagined from her speaking of my father that she had heard from him,-that Mr. Seabright had received a letter. I began to  be certain that it was so. Mrs. Wilson saw that I was agitated, and begged me to be calm, and try to compose myself to sleep. But a fever was throbbing in my veins, and for days and weeks I lay there, in my bed; sometimes conscious of the presence of my friends, and of an elderly and kind physician. At other moments  I doubted my own identity, and could not think of my name. But one train of thought still furrowed my brain. It was the re- membrance of my father. In my delirium, I sometimes fancied that I saw him in the physician behind a mask; and I asked him to take it off that I might see his own dear face; and begrged him for the love he had borne my mother, whom I resembled, and for whom I was named, not to forsake me quite. Sormetimes I thougrht Mr. Seabright had posession of my father's voice, and that he made use of it in speaking to me; and one night I had him called out of his bed, that I might again hear those sweet tones. In my lucid intervals I felt almost assured that he had come, and only waited for the crisis of my disorder to pass, that he might see me without subjecting me to dangrerous excitement. At last I found myself recovering under a full consciousness of all that had transpired. The attentions of Amy were divided be- tween me and her brother; but Mr. Lysander left but little room for any one else to serve Willie. In my fitt visit to him, after congratulating me on my convalescence, he assured me that "N',s nurse was ever so attentive as Mr. Lysander; no friendship Two ever so warm or so disinterested ; no temper was ever so sweet nor heart so kind as Mr. Lysander's:  And no other man, thought I, was ever the object of love so pure, so holyand so uniform, as that  which fills the heart of this amiable child.

"If I can but dream that I hold my little love again in my arms, I shall wake with sorrow that the illusion is broken. O Willie, Willie, how desolate will be my existence without you." "I   am a very feeble child," said Willie, "and had you not great love, and great patience, I must be a burden to you."  "Oh, never, never," said Mr. Lysander. As I sat near them, listening to this discourse, I saw that Wilhe was becoming exhausted by so much conversation. Mr. Ly- sander took him gently in his arms and carried him to his bed.  It was his hour to receive his nourishment,-a little panada, pre- pared by the hand of his ever-faithful attendant. I went and sat by him while Mr. Lysander was making it ready; and when he brought it, in a porringer, and placed it on a napkin before Willie as he was raised in the bed, the child took the spoon in his ema- ciated hand, and raising his deep blue eyes to those of his friend, said, with grateful emphasis, "Bless you, dear Mr. Lysander." I afterwards found that he always received his food using the same expression, accompanied by the same fond and grateful look. He became much interested in a clock which stood upon the mantelpiece, and called it his " time-keeper." He sometimes cal- culated the hours that he might continue on earth, for he thought he should be called away about Christmas. He had, from his in- fancy, been an admirer of the character of our Saviour, indepen- dent of his hope of salvation through his merits; and was singu- larly attached to the observance of Christmas as a day of un- mingled devotion. He said one day to Mr. Lysander, "The time draws near; and that faithful time-keeper reminds me of ,every second that falls                    ,X   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      235 from my allotment.  "Do you hear," continued he, "it says ' one less /' one less P' The pendulum admonishes me in those words continually; and I love to hear them, and to meditate in the night on those little atoms of time as they are cut off and cast into the eternity behind. Once, when it had run down, I was un- happy until I had heard it again. I sometimes, when all is still at night, find it an accompaniment to the beating of my heart, for that too says 'one less!" Never was there so interesting an invalid as that loved child. He seemed to be attended by none of the annoyances of sickness. The body appeared to be wrapt in the soul. We felt the influence of his piety as it were of a disembodied saint or angel. The re- cent sad events seemed about to be crowned by another, through which we might have a nearer view of Heaven. Whatever feelings of resentment I might have felt toward Mr. Seabright for having misrepresented my prospects to Dr. Dudley, they were entirely effaced by his uniform kindness and solicitude for my comfort and happiness since my late illness. I now viewed his conduct only as an injudicious effort for my good; and if my respect for his character for truth was somewhat lessened, my esteem for the qualities of his heart was greatly augmented; and his apparent error, which I ascribed to the weakness of the human judgment, went far to reconcile me to my former somewhat simi- lar offence. His intimacy and favor with Dr. Dudley continued. The latter was still the family physician, although Mr. Seabright had, from motives of delicacy, called in another to attend on me during my illness. Dr. Dudley was as much in our society as ever; but, although I did not avoid him, I felt a restraint in his presence. Hie appeared reserved and thoughtful, and sometimes embarrassed in offering me those little attentions which common courtesy required. I fancied that he was suffering from mortification in having been betrayed into making advances under false impressions. But why did he still remain in the neighborhood Why court the inti- macy of our family? and particularly of him who had attempted to deceive him? I could not answer these questions. I began to think that the human heart was an enigma-too deep for solution; and'that human actions were, in many instances, at variance with the motives which impelled them. Under these impressions the guileless character of Mr I Lysander; and the plain good sense and undeviatin$ truthfulness of Mrs. Wilson, became my admiration- my standard of the perfection of moral excellence.   236       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, One day Mr. Seabright received a package of letters from Europe, and after having perused them, he informed me that one of them contained intelligence of my father; and he read, or pretended to read a paragraph, stating that "Charles Burleigh, Esq., would be in America within a few months; that he had not advanced his pecuniary interests within the past year, but on the contrary was diminishing the resources already in his possession." This intelligence, vague as it was, armed my heart into a re- newed resolution of again putting forth my own energies. . Through the generosity of hrs. Carlisle, I had not been allowed to expend the little sum I had already earned. And the piano, a gift from Mr. Seabright, was my own, and for which I thanked him more warmly at this time than when I first received it. In a few mo- ments I had in anticipation a most comfortable little home for my father and myself-my daily efforts a pleasant labor of love. Mr. Seabright approved of my resolution, warning me, at the same time, ' that a constant care of my health, and the cultivation of a cheer- ful mind, were necessary, in order to prepare me to enter upon my, arduous duties,--" should they be required." I at once made my prospects and my determination known to all in the house, determined that Dr. Dudley should understand  that I had a resource for happiness, in the performance of a duty; and shall I own the weakness,--I felt that to meet his approbation, and to deserve his esteem, without any view to a kindlier feeling, would be a most precious satisfaction. From this time I ceased to r reflect upon, or to be annoyed by what had passed; and only de-  layed to put my plans- into immediate execution by the advice of  Mr. Seabright, who argued that my health was not sufficiently re- established; and also that the respect due to the situation of Wil- lie, and the need of my consolations and kind offices in the fam- ily, should' induce me to put off my enterprise until the next spring.        . Willie continued to fail daily in body, but his mind seemed to : be gaining a spiritual maturity. With the pious rector of --- Church, who visited him often, he conversed like one old in the faith, and diligent in the search of divine truth. From him he ? received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper with humility and j thankfulness, confessing his dependence on Him who had institut-  ed this holy ordinance. We were all much affected during this solemn scene, and we began more attentively to search the Scrip- tures for information concerning our duties to God. Dr. Dudley,j s , .-   THE PURE PLEASURES OP PURE MNDS.       237 Amy, and myself, read with a view to learn more of the truth; and if our knowledge was not deep, our desire for instruction was ardent. Mr. Seabright and Mrs. Wilson kept up a conversation between themselves on the divine attributes. She maintained the doctrine of predestination, in all its bearings, and argued that great good was to result from the operations of evil, so that the measure of righteousness might eventually be full. Mr. Seabright, on the contrary, maintained that passive sin, which was a neglect of duty, had greater extent than holiness; which was also a passive principle. And that active sin, which was the antagonist of piety-an active principle also-made prose- lytes,'not only from the multitude, but from the ranks of the oppo- nent; and that. the measure of righteousness, in which there was room for all mankind, could never be filled. To this Mrs. Wilson would not assent, for she had set her heart on the reprobation of some, if but to sustain her doctrine of the " fatal decree." But how she reconciled the admeasurement of her own system of theology, with the squares and cubes of that of Mr. Seabright, we could not understand; and we regarded her as being doctrinated be- yond our comprehension, and him as being more deeply imbued with geometrical calculations, than with revelation. Under a less tender state of mind, we might have taken a deeper interest in these disputes, which extended on both sides, into all the divisions of theological controversy; but we now felt more inclined to the contemplation of a candidate for immortality, whose theory lay in the cultivation of a pure heart. We read the Scriptures daily in the presence of Willie, he being our guide in the interpretation. How true, that the dying saint is, of all preachers, listened to with the least doubt of the inspiration of his words. Our dear Wilhe was highly favored in the exemption from bodily pain, so that his mind was undisturbed in its heavenly se- renity. The only appearance of human weakness to be discovered in him, was his fondness for Mr. Lysander; neither was it sur- prising, since Lysander was so entirely devoted to him. I was often led to admire his tender solicitude. He would watch the countenance of his favorite, to ascertain when he wanted more or less air, and would say, in a voice so sweetly sad, "Will little love have the window open?" or "Will little love have the door closed 8" or, "Is there a hard place in the pillow, orin the clothes under my little love?'"One day, Willie felt that his feet were too warm, and pleasantly said, "My feet feel as if they wanted to breathe. Will   238       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, my dear Mr. Lysander remove the clothes a little?" "Yes, little love," said Lysander, uncovering and wiping the perspiration from his feet with his silk handkerchief, and blowing upon them with his breath, and saying to himself, "Lysander forgot the dear little footies, did'nt he?-Lysander won't do so again." All who have experienced a total prostration of physical strength, know how soothing, how acceptable, are the attentions and the manner of words dictated by love, under a sense of the feebleness and dependence of the object. To such it will not ap- pear strange that Willie, who was treated with the tenderness, and accustomed to the endearing expressions, which a good and watch- ful parent bestows on a darling babe, should regard Lysander with unlimited confidence and love, as the protector and supporter of his helpless existence, without the regrets which dependence gemn- erally feels for the care of kindred and friends. The attentions of M: Lysander were dictated by pure love, unalloyed by the thought that he was doing a favor to another, or that there was any merit in his devotion. A little incident occurred one day, which I was at first inclined to think savored of affectation, but which afterwards appeared to  me as a beautiful instance of the sacredness of memory. Willie's hair had grown much during his sickness, and seemed to annoy him by falling about his face. I was, therefore, by the advice of the physician, clipping off the soft bright locks with my scissors, and throwing them'into, or so near the fire, that they began to burn, when Mr. Lysander came in.-"Oh!" said he, a" how could you ." and he drew them out from the coals and ashes, lamenting that " a single hair of that dear head should be lost." He laid them on a clean white paper, and I placed the other locks beside them as I took them off, he grieving all the while over those that had been " so cruelly used." When I had finished, I desired him to let me separate the burnt parts from the rest. He was indig-o nant at the thought. "What," said he, " though these treasures be scorched, crisped, and disfigured, are they not a part of the : precious whole?" After folding the paper, and putting it carefully away in his bureau, he drew a chair to the bedside, and sitting down, laid his face near to Willie's, and began a conversation in a kind of murmur, which Willie appeared well to understand. It was something about dark and siken tresses, that "all went into the grave upon their own beautiful head."  "Ah!"  continued he, "you will soon meet, spirit to spirit; kindred to kindred; no more ]    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       239 your breathings of love to warm and cheer my world-imprisoned soul; no more your presence to gladden my sorrowing eyes. The grave will be closed over all that remains on earth of my two loved ones; all except these treasured locks-and they seared in part, and shrunken-emblems of my own blighted affections."  And he wept on the face of the child, who assured him of a happy meet- ing both with Julia and himslf. "In a little while, my dear Mr. LyVsander," said he, "we who are dead to you here, shall welcome you into eternal life. Here we must part. There parting is un- known. Do not weep, my dear Mr. Lysander.:' And" he kissed the tears from the cheek of his friend. I recollected, at this time, of having heard that Mrs. Carlisle had lost a daughter of the name of "Julia," tand that Wilhe was to her, both personally and mentally, a most striking resemblance. But there was a reserve even to mystery in the family affairs, con- cerning which I suppressed my curiosity, believing that tenderness on the subject of so many afflictions, in rapid succession, found greater relief in silence than in the consolation of words. As Christmas drew near, the hopes of Willie seemed to bright- en. "'The time is near,9' said he, "May the birthday of my Saviour on earth, be my birthday in Heaven. Come here, my dear Mr. Lysander, my loved, come to your own poor Willie. You used to write, poetry. Will you be so kind as to write for me a Hymn to Christmas? And let it be my own, an expression of my love for that sacred day?" Mr. Lysander readily promised to write as an amanuensis, and to furnish the rhyme, if Willie would dictate the sentiments. It was on the twenty-fourth of December, a cold and stormy day. The small and naked branches of the tmres near the house, striking the windows from the force of the wind, and beating off the snow as it fell upon the panes of glass near which sat Lysan- der writing, with many fears that the task of dictator would be too much for one so low. Wilhe was pillowed up in his bed, in an ex- ceedingly happy frame of mind; but he could only give utter- ance to his thoughts in a whisper; yet he did not seem to suffer from the effort. In the evening when he slept, Mr. Lysander transcribed what he had written, into the following llnma to Otrittmaa. In clouded sky and hallow wind, In barren field and leafless tree, f,'8.   240        CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, In Winter cold and drear, I find A season that brings joy to me. Though earth its faded livery wears, Though blooming nature feels decay, One bright event my bosom cheers,- This season brings Christ's natal day. I'll make this day a jubilee, Nor aught to other cares attend; I'll set it all apart to thee, Thou more than brother, more than friend, I'll call to mind my earliest days, When wondering at thy mighty love, Each Christmas morn I tuned my lays, In concert with the quire above. And as on earth I close my days, My joy with gratitude shall blend; I'll breathe a note of solemn praise To Him who gave me such a Friend. In this does Heaven to me impart, A foretaste of the joys above, With Christ, whom this devoted heart Can ne'er forsake nor cease to love. And when the storms of life are o'er, And all its winters fled away, A fairer morn, than known before, Shall wake me to a cloudless day. We sang this hymn in concert the same evening, with a view to give Willie the pleasure of hearing it in the morning. He slept well during the night, and about eight in the morning, asked for some rice-water; after which he desired to be raised a little in the bed, and looking at Mrs. Wilson, who was assisting, he said, This is Christmas day, good mother." "It is," said she, " a day to be celebrated with thanksgiving." "In my heart I give thanks," said Willie, " even in this poor heart." Mr. Lysander, who had watched all night, had not yet arisen, when the doctor and the rector came in. Willie smiled as they ap- proached his bed. He asked the clergyman to pray. Dr. Dud-   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      241 ley felt his pulse, and anticipating his almost immediate dissolution asked "if he wished Mr. Lysander to be called?" "Spare him, " said Willie, " the pain of parting.' He seemed to join fervently in the prayer, and when it was finished, asked to hear sung the "Hymn to Christmas."   He then composed himself with closed eyes, as if to listen. The doctor stood on one side the bed, and the clergyman on the other, each holding a dear little pale hand. Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Seabright stood at the foot of the bed. Both Amy and myself were so overcome with emotion, that we could not at first raise our voices, when Willie began to whisper the words. We then commenced, and sang the piece with tolerable composure. At the conclusion, we went to the bed to receive a last kiss, and to ask a parting blessing;--but the lips that should give the kiss, were closed, and the voice that was ever ready to bless, was now, hushed for ever. Amy, to whom   the last year had been fruitful in afflictions, seemed, by this last dispensation, to feel that the work must be finished by her own dissolution. But she was in good health, and the youthful spirit rose above these melancholy apprehensions; and although she felt heavily her bereavements, she found that all the ties of life were not severed. She loved me as a sister, and for Mr., Lysander,; kindred ties were not necessary to constitute in her, the full confidence of sisterly affection. In Mr. Seabright she had a  friend and protector; and in Mrs. Wilson, a good example, a ready adviser, and a motherly companion; so that if the year had deprived her of one class of blessings, it had secured her in an- other. Mr Lysander was prepared to part with his young friend, whom he considered as not dead, but gone to join the family of which he himself should again be a member. Mrs. Wilson, believing that Death would now stay his hand from the family, was desirous of maling her annual visit to Bos- ton, that she might again renew her vows of consecration to the service of God, in her beloved "Christ Church."  Arid Mr. Ly- sander felt it to be a pious duty to accompany her thither.   242        CHARACTERS UNVEII=rD; ONv /                  i -CHAPTER XXVIII. Mrs. Wilson's visit to Christ Church-The pleasures of doing Sood-Lysander's recol- lections of the late Mr. Preble, alias William Carlisle--is early history--Voyage across the ocean-Paris-Antidote to pensiveness. IT was early in January, when wrapped in the warmest apparel, with a bundle for the "Fragment Society," and money for the "Contribution Box," and numerous little charities which she had in contemplation, that Mrs. Wilson, leaning upon Mr. Lysander with one arm, and on her staff with the other, set out with a grateful, it may have been a proud heart, to join the congregation, where, for the finst time in a series of years, she found herself able to de- posit more than the 'widow's mite."   She smiled, and smiled again, as she left us, and nodded a profusion of" good byes ;" and iMr. Seabright, who accompanied them  to the station, and saw them safe in the car, declared, on his return, that the act of mak- ing one so happy as Mrs. Wilson appeared, in prospect of going into the church of her early faith, in a state above mendicity, brought more satisfaction to the heart than thousands spent in lux- ury, or in popular donations. On the Monday following their departure, Mr. Lysander re- turned, saying, that Mrs. Wilson had found some very old friends in the neighborhood of her visit, and they had persuaded her to remain with them for a few weeks; at the end of which time, they promised that she should be safely brought home. "And now, Mr. Lysander,? said Mr. Seabright, a this fortuitous absence of Mrs. Wilson gives you an opportunity of relating whatever you may know of her misfortunes, to these young ladies. And for my gratification as well as theirs, will you be so kind as to give us a full relation of your acquaintance with the Carlisle family, which I   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      243 have reason to believe embraces both their history and your own. 6"I would most willingly do so," answered Mr. Lysander, but that I fear the character of- the late William Carlisle will suffer in their estimation." "Whatever vices my dear uncle may have fallen into," said Amy," I am sure they were sufficiently atoned for; and hard must be the heart that knew him, for the last year of his life, as we knew him, an humble Christian, and feel that he was not suffi- ciently redeemed from his youthful errors." "I thank you, dear Amy," said Lysander, "for giving me this proof of your charity; but there were about eleven years previous to his return of which I can give no account, but of which I be- lieve Mr. Seabright has an intimate knowledge. I fully believed him dead, and his mother was under the same impression. I had not the slightest supposition that he was in existence, until the morning of his death. Yet I often noticed a something familiar in his sentiments, and in his peculiar- mode of expression, but could not recollect where I had met with it." You will relate," said Mr. Seabright, " as far as his departure from New Orleans. I think I can then explain what followed." After we were in bed, Amy appeared to be restless and troubled in mind. "I fearl;" said she, "'that I shall be less happy, in conse- quence of the information about to be communicated by Mr. Ly- sander. I  had always heard that my uncle William  was the victim of a steamboat disaster; but my grandmother would not converse on the subject; and I never learned any thing more of the manner of his death.  Neither did I know that he had ever been married, and above all, that the daughter of Mrs. Wilson had been his wife. Why was not the connection between our family and Mrs. Wilson :acknowledged? We were on friendly terms. Both she and my grandmother descended from good families. Both had been educated in the same  style,-accustomed to the same class of associates,--suffered equally from misfortune,-and both possessing great piety. It is strange indeed; but I do hope, that in the narrative of Mr. Lysander I may find excuse for the errors of my dear uncle, if, indeed, he were guilty of any. I have heard that he was a candidate for the ministry. How, then, could he have been in the way of temptation 2" I tried to calm her mind by assuring her, that however im- properly her uncle might have conducted himself, she would find   244       CHARACTERS UNVSYIT n; OR, palliating circumstances enough to clear him from all premeditated guilt; and since she could have no fear of the disclosure of any crime, but only of some youthful indiscretion, she must lay aside her forebodings and try to sleep. The next morning, Dr. Dudley called and aske'd the favor of a few moments'. conversation with me alone. The message was sent by Amy, and I immediately descended to the parlor, glad of having an opportunity of convincing him that I was not a party to the deception that was attempted to be practised upon him. He received me kindly; and after a few moments of common- place remarks, he stated, that having, from our first acquaintance, cherished a deep regard for me, and, finally, given me the best affections of his heart, he had come to ask me to accept his hand, and become a participator in his fortune and his prospects. A girl of sixteen would have been less embarrassed on that oc- casion than I. My happiness was involved in an immediate an- swer; but wearied with the conflict I had endured, enfeebled by sickness, and a sharer in the sorrows of others, I felt doubtful of the propriety of any answer that I could give, and remained silent. After waiting for some time, he said, "I did think, Miss Burleigh, that notwithstanding your distance and reserve for the last few months, that you loved me." Ere I had time to frame a dignified and maidenly response to this somewhat confident language, a truth, which lay concealed at the bottom of my heart, disregarding all the rules of romance on such occasions, took advantage of the favorable moment, and rushed forth with the confession, "I do love you." To me this day was one of melancholy happiness, melancholy  because my father, for whom I found that Dr. Dudley had made a most liberal provision, was not present; and happy in my own prospects, together with the certainty of providing for him. Mr. Seabright, with whom we immediately conferred on the subject, seemed almost too happy, while poor Amy kissed us all, not omit- ting Dr. Dudley, now that he was going to be " one of us," and wept in advance of the recital which she was sure would cause her to weep ever afterwards. "Not so," said Mr. Seabright. "N ot so," said Mr. Lysander. "It is a tale of indiscretion and suffering on the part of your relation. A sense of his errors led him to fly from his family; but do not believe him guilty of crime." Amy seemed more composed, for she did not notice the evasion in the last few words of Mr. Lysander, and insisted on hearing the whole   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      245 truth, which was readily promised her, under the impression that she would find extenuating circumstances, even for his crimi- nality. The evening came, and Mr. Lysander presented himself as a narratoi; with the air of one about to testify unwillingly against a. friend. He prefaced the relation with a long eulogy on the talents and virtues of William Carlisle; and when he found he must unfold the tale, he said, with a deep sigh, "We that have not been tempted above our strength should be tenderly compas- sionate to the feelings of those who have." He then commenced thus: i' "I was left an orphan while too young to have any recollec- tion of either of my parents. An elder half-brother, son of my father by a first wife, was of age, and he was appointed my guar- dian. He was a most excellent brother, and faithfully supplied the place of a father. By him I was put filrst with a nurse, and after- wards sent to an infant school. In both of these situations I ex- perienced the kindest usage. At ten vears of age I was taken'to New York and placed in a grammar school, and I there became acquainted with William Carlisle. He was of my own age, and his affectionate nature soon attached me to his person; for I have always been more easily won by that which is loving than by that which is only lovely. William Carlisle was both. I therefore loved him immeasurably. He was one of five children, and lived with his mother, who was a widow. Their house was in the upper part-of Broadway, and there I was, almost daily, a guest. Mrs. Carlisle was very partial to me, from our first acquaintance, and flattered me by commending William's choice of a companion. Soon after I became acquainted with this family, Sarah, the eldest, maried Mr. Richard Burleigh, and went with him to reside in New Orleans, where he owned much property. Within a year after this, ChaIles and Amy, the two next in age, both fell victims to consumption. "Mrs. Carlisle was a  woman of the finest sensibilities, and at- tached to her children with an ardor almost reprehensible, from the constant solicitude in which it involved her; otherwise she was of a  most happy temperament. Her husband had died of con- sumption; and the loss of her two children, of the same disease, confirmed her apprehensions that her family had inherited this un - fortunate element of his constitution. "At my own request, and with the desire of Mrs. Carlisle, I   248      . CHARACTERS UNVErIED ; OBR, had become a member of her family, so that I was now the inse- parable companion of William. These were my beautiful days! i Why should a remembrance of them give me pain? I had a sweet little, lovely pet in the family,-little Julia Carlisle. She was just four years younger than myself, and she loved me just as our dear little Willie has since done." Here Mr. Lysander became agitated, and walked about the room. We wept, partly from sympathy, and partly from the re- collection of the loss we had so recently sustained. He again took his seat, and smiling sadly on us all, resumed: "Never was there such a resemblance between two children. Like him she was so beautiful, so loving, so gentle. But there is, doubtless, a stronger likeness between angels than between mortals; and the angel character commenced in these two children here on earth. "At the age of sixteen we were transferred from our home and our school in New-York, to Harvard University, in Cambridge; that, Institution being in high favor with Mrs. Carlisle; in conse- quence of an ancestor of her own having been one of its founders. lhe order for our departure was to me most unwelcome; but little Julia loved learned people, and said to me that she thought them  more entitled to her regard than those who let their minds run to waste, when they had opportunities for improvement. She was of a studious turn of mind, and had made great progress in her books, and always expected me to know a great deal more than herself, even where I thought her perfect in any little branch of knowledge. She had no hesitation in asking me questions, for she had become possessed of the opinion that men and boys should know more than women and girls, and said she  loved to be told. ' "Although I was regarded as an apt scholar, arid had con- stantly borne off the palm from my emulating -classmates, yet I was rather impetuous in my attachments than in my ambition; and but for the highvalue which Julia attached to education, I should have at once decided to forego the advantages of a series of years spent at Cambridge, rather than immolate my happiness on the altar of absence. Willialn Carlisle was willing to sacrifice immediate comfort for the sake of preparing himself, as far as edu- cation was a requisite, for the ministry. His religion was a gen- uine sentiment of the heart, and gave him great influence over others. He was not aware that I had any wish to remain in New   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      247 York, if he were absent; and I soon banished the unmanly desire of remaining from my mind. "My brother, who had, -from time to time, given the most hearty approval to my conduct, now not only acknowledged him-' self proud of me as a brother, but satisfied with me as a ward. To Mrs. Carlisle and her son he gave much credit for what he termed, the 'wisdom of my ways.' For me, I was quite as grate- ful to him, perhaps more so, for his good opinion of my friends, than for his brotherly kindness to myself. He had always sup- plied me liberally with pock loney, from which I had made a considerable saving; for in a/tamily where every charm seemed to have centred, and with the ties of love and friendship binding me to my home, no dissipation, no unowned recreation called for useless expenditures. Pleased with my economy, my brother gave me unlimited control over my own fortune, saying that I needed no advice from him.  "Those who are acquainted with college life, know that the first year is one of initiation throughout-therefore the most tly- ing of the whole series, to the physical and the moral tempera- ment of the student.   We, however, passed through this first year in sound health, and with unimpeached morals. For me, I studied most laboriously. I loved learning for its own sake, and I had to win the approbation of Julia Carlisle. Even a boy at his books is sometimes sensible of the workings of the little god' at his heart, and looks far ahead to the possibility of happiness with the divinity whose name is the silent chant of his labors. Wil- liam studied with no other motive than to make himself learned as a divine.  "At the annual vacation we visited our home. The family were the same as when we left. Julia had grown a little taller, and was at first more shy of me than when we went away, and seemed to divide her love more equally between me and her brother. Yet she still retained the habit of standing so near to my chair, that her shoulder would rest against mine, and with her book in one hand, play in my curling hair with the other, as she conversed with me about her lessons. She sometimes mentioned her loneliness, and once asked, rather indirectly, if I had any other little favor- ite. Ah, my dear little Julia! - She was indeed a sweet child. "Another year and Julia was fourteen. She was still a child, yet she received my kiss with a little reserve, and returned it with   248       CHAR A CTERS USNVI,^D; OR, I hesitation. Another year, and again T saw Julia. She was then  . fifteen. Another, and she was sixteen;-a young lady in every thing beautiful; She was innocence personified, a divine reAlity. I felt the :poverty of having but one heart. I wanted a thousand, that I might include them all in one gift for Julia." I am sure if Mr. Lysander had but looked around, he would have seen smiles at the close of his last sentence. But he went away to the other end of the room; and after sitting there awhile, he came back and resumed his sitting and his narrative with great  composure. .  "Julia appeared more like the child of former days, than when I saw her last. She was more sedate, it is true, but less reserved in her conversation, and frequently made mention of her early and continued friendship for me. And to my fond acknowledgment of ! devotion, she replied, 'I never had a doubt of being beloved in return.                               "We sometimes walked out together, and I saw with alarm     that she was fatigued with very slight exertion, and at such times -  endeavored to relieve herself by a half-suppressed cough. I con-  versed with Mrs. Carlisle on the subject of my attachment, and my : fears. She admitted that she had long regarded me as a member  ]: of her own family, and said she could know of no greatel happi- ness than that of calling me her son. Of my union with Julia, she- did not even now despair. 'But, my dear Lysander,' said she, 'I hold her with no tenure but that of the Divine will.' Once more we took our leave of home and friends.

"But how little the human heart knows what it is capable of bearing. The sight of her wasting child filled the mind of Mrs. Carlisle with new energies. Her recent affliction seemed to be banished from her thoughts, and her whole soul was absorbed in one desire--that of restoring her son to health. The family phy- sician recommended a sea voyage, and a change of climate for one year. And a voyage to Europe was determined upon. I also, was to be of the party. I was now of age, and my paternal in- heritance was placed at my own disposal. My brother approved of my intended excursion, and of my residence abroad, in the company of my friends, believing that new scenes would have a tendency to dissipate the melancholy occasioned by my late be- reavement, and to enlarge my views, and strengthen my mind by an acquaintance with the world. But I had other feelings; I did not wish to dissipate the melancholy which I carried in my heart, and of which not one jot nor tittle has ever been removed. This heartis, at this moment, as much devoted to Julia Carlisle, as when she laid her pale cheek against mine, and bade me farewell. No passionate burst of grief has ever been allowed to carry off a particle of my sacred sorrow ; and when I meet my Julia in Hea- ven, I meet her with the same fulness of love as when she left me here." Mr. Lysander was silent, and covered his face with his hands. We looked upon him with a feeling of tender admiration and sym- pathy. Mr. Seabright sighed deeply, saying, "There are hearts which can bear no second invasion." And he again sighed. Mr. Lysander resumed: "We took our departure from the shores of the United States, on a fine morning in August, in the good ship Rosanna, which landed us safely in Liverpool on the thirtieth day of the voyage. William Carlisle was at first sea-sick, but afterwards improved his health so rapidly, that on landing I thought I had never seen him look so well. We visited several of the large towns in England, lastly London, where we spent some time, and then proceeded to Paris, where we designed to winter. "Mrs. Carlisle received so much encouragement from the im- proved health of her son, that she seemed almost to have forgot- ten that she had ever felt a pang of anxiety for any other. Her affections went not into the graves with her lost children, but al- "^   250        CHARACTERS UNVFITlEn; ORB most to forgetfulness of them and of her married daughter, seemed to have centered with re-doubled tenacity on William.

The fascinating widow-Her dignity, grace, eloque nee, etc.--Suspicions of Lysander- Credulity of Mrs. Carlisle-Infatuation-Warner-His high pretensions--Charitablo temperament of Mrs. Carlisle. "THnERE was at our hotel a large number of Americans,- among the rest a lady of the name of Delano. She was awidow, and said to possess great wealth. She was no longer young, neither had she ever been beautiful, but she was elegant and ac- complished. There was about her a brilliancy, both personal and mental, that I had never before seen united in the same person. In the ease, dignity, and grace of her manners,she was the admira- tion of all, and her conversation was so instructive and varied, so fiaught with every embellishment that could render female elo- quence charming, and so chastened with piety, that we thought her a paragon, not only of eloquence but of excellence. "Such was the lady who, a few days after our arrival, sent in her card. Mrs. Carlisle, after making some inquiries, was not slow in returning her civility, and congratulated herself on her good fortune in meeting with a country-woman of attainments so very extraordinary. Obsequiousness was never a characteristic with me; and yet, I must own, that I felt a desire to appear well in the presence of this lady,-or rather, I was not prepared for her contempt, and felt that I had something to do to please; but what that something was, I could not precisely comprehend; and this consciousness of my inability to compete with her in all her tact of good-breeding and polite conversation, soon made me feel an- noyed, on account of her apparent superiority over me-a mere boy, who wanted at least ten years of intercourse with the learned and formal world; to be her equal. But not so with William Car- lisle. He was content with himself, and supposing that he was always pleasing to others, and being fascinated by the presence of /   252       CHARACTERS UNVYCIT ED; OR, Mrs. Delano, he gave himself up to a passive enjoyment of her society. Daily was her carriage brought to the door, with an in- vitation for us to ride. I usually declined, preferring a stroll by myself, in all the freedom of an unknown and unnoticed pedes- trian, to the restrained movements, and equally restrained conver- sation of the inside of a private coach. "(Mrs. Delano took no pains to conceal that she had great wealth, but assured us that she looked upon it as vanity, save only in the opportunities. it afforded her of doing good. " Mrs. Carlisle and her son were so entirely engrossed by this one companion, thatr they forgot a plan that we had formed of bringing together a little coterie of Americans, weekly, at our own apartments. When I reminded William of our previous inten- tion, he strongly opposed the enlargement of our sphere of ac- quaintance, and pleaded the necessity of comparative seclusion as being most conducive to the continuance of his health. This he said while preparing to go out to dine, at seven in the evening, with Mrs. Delano and a 'few choice American friends. " The conversation of Mrs. Delano with Mr,. William Carlisle was at first almost exclusively on religious subjects; and I was astonished to hear how she would quote religious authors. But I was soon convinced that she procured her knowledge for the oc- casion from reviews of religious publications.  I believed this from the circumstance that she dwelt less, upon the elements of the works than upon the manner in which they were expounded; and she condemned or approved with the unhesitating assurance of a practised reviewer. And while she dogmatised both the mother and the son, she had the art of making them believe that their decisions were necessary to give her own views validity in her own judgment; and they, in pure deference to her great mind, were ever ready to coincide with her in opinion, of what they only knew from her representation.  She would sometimes dwell on the miseries of mankind in consequence of the prevalence of sin, and was often pathetic in her comments on the sufferings of the inno- cent victims of the wiles of the practised in iniquity. I soon saw that she had tears at her command; and, in -the absence of Mrs.  Carlisle, I once heard her make an unbecoming remark as if by accident, and then with a well-affected naivet, shew that she had something like a blush at command also. " Had I not known, from the character of my loved Julia, what innocence and pure goodness was, I might not so readily  THE PUBRE PLEASVRES OF, PURE MNDS.     253 have detected their counterfeit in another. I did not expect from Mrs. Delano, at middle age, the simplicity and ingenuousness of Julia Carlisle, scarce merged from childhood; but I had a right to expect from her, or from  any other woman, equal sincerity and equal remoteness from whatever could excite injurious suspicion. ~I!    I viewed, in Mrs. Carlisle, a lady by many years the senior of this widow, the unsophisticated principles and habits which are the safeguards of virtue, truth, and piety in females, from the cradle of childhood to the octogenarian grave. Why, then, had I not a right to condemn, in Mrs. Delano, the wart of such principles as adorned the character of Mrs. Carlisle?  William  treated my doubts of her worthiness first with ridicule, then with contempt, and at last with resentment, and, finally, he treated me with rude- ness. But as my friendship for him and his family could'know no diminution, whatever might be his course, I resolved to watch every motion of the sorceress, and to be always in readiness to step forward and save him fronm ruin. Mrs. Carlisle, who supposed that her son was enjoying the most innocent recreations, and seeing that his spirits were revived, gave herself up to the pleasures of reading, and of retirement, of which she was fond, and which she seemed to require. "Of the designs of Mrs. Delano I had formed no conception, and having lost the confidence of William Carlisle, I must find other resources for information. I was not inclined to employ spies upon the conduct of Mrs. Delano, as a disclosure of my watchfulness might hasten some iniquitous plan to a crisis. And I could not afflict Mrs. Carlisle by making known to her my sus- picions. I therefore resolved, as the only means of coming at the truth, to try to regain the favor of William. With this intent I asked him to go with me one evening to some place of amuse- ment ' You to a place of amusement,' said he; 'I thought you never visited such places. But to tell you the truth, I have an engagement with Mrs. Delano to meet a few friends.'   I then com- plained that he had given me very  little   of his company of late, and asked if I might be one of the party that evening . 'I cannot say,' he answered, 'that the number is not already made up. I will ascertain.' He left me, and went to seek Mrs. Delano. He soon returned in company with the lady, who, with great sweetness and courtesy, informed me that it would be impossible for her to introduce a stranger to her fiMends, without first asking the privilege, assuring  254       CHARACTERBS UNVEr D; OR, me of her regret that such was the case, and asked me to allow ,her to introduce an American gentleman, a kinsman of her own, to my acquaintance, the next day.? "Mr. William Carlisle attached great importance to the visit of the kinsman of Mrs. Delano, who, it was said, had just returned from an excursion among the glens of Switzerland. "The next morning, at breakfast, William hinted to his mother the propriety of making a good appearance before the expected guest. "How did my indignant blood rush through my veins oni hearing MRS. CARLISLE instructed concerning her appearance be- fore a companion of Mrs. Delano! I could not feel contempt for  William my long-loved friend, the brother of my Julia, the son of  my beloved, my honored, my revered,-I would say ' mother,' but that fond term was denied me by the will of Heaven. "Mr. Warner, the relative of Mrs. Delano, did us the honor,'  as William expressed it, to dine that day at our table, in company . with the lady herself. During the dinner, when words are ever more in relief than at any other hour in the day, our colloquial attempts were altogether baffled by the more elevated conversa- tion carried on between .our guests, and which related entirely to ! their own grand affairs. To me it seemed like a rehearsal of parts, ! in which they had already been accustomed to act.       ji MNrs. Carlisle, after their departure, observed to me that she ! thought them quite egotistic and highly presumptive in engrossing ; the entire conversation; 'and,' continued she, ' they manifested too much bombast to comport with my ideas of refinement and good taste. Mrs. Delano is, certainly, less attractive than she appeared a at first. But great wealth sometimes gives people more assurance and independence of manner than is agreeable; yet we learn, by J much travel and association with strangers, to be satisfied with people as we find them, and to subject our forbearance to their pe- culiarities.'               , "These remarks of Mrs. Carlisle proceeded from her know- ledge of the better portion of society. She had never come in  t contact with vice. She had never been deceived. She could not, therefore, be mistrustful. She could only disapprove of improper appearances. "It may be asked, How came I to be mistrustful, not -having had experience of the mortification and contrition which follows an association with the artful and Vicious ' To me the case apF j   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     255 pears different.

I did not form any conclusions at that time," said Mr. Lysan- der, " but I had a knowledge of the good; and seeing something which appeared to me like a contrast, and that something working a change in the character of my unsuspecting friend, I became, perhaps, more watchful for his safety than I should for my own, had the machinations of the strange woman been levelled at my- self; for, in the latter case, the vanity inspired by her plrefelrence might have blinded  me to the glaring inconsistency of her pre- tended attachment, consequently to my oln danger. As it was, my judgment was left unbiased, and   ay observation, joined to my subsequent interest in the affair, has convinced me that there is a natural, moral disunity between the tender-hearted and bene- volent and the reverse of womanlind.

' IT appeared yery strange to me that we were never joined in our amusements by William Carlisle and Mrs. Delano, although they appeared to me as much in pursuit of pleasure as 'ourselves; neither was I ever permitted to accompany them to any of their places of resort. I trembled for the peace. of Mrs. Carlisle, and concealed from her my suspicions. At length she complained to me that she feared Mrs. Delano was gaining too much influence over her son, and questioned me with regard to my knowledge of his pursuits, grieving, at the same time, that he no longer seemed to have any pleasure in her company, but rather avoided her, she supposed, in consequence of her having expressed some doubts of the genuineness of the moral and religious pretensions of Mrs. Delano, who had almost entirely discontinued to visit her. " Being as ignorant as herself of their movements, I could give her no information, but promised her my faithful services in the restoration of her son to her confidence and to her society. I had, so far, spent every moment of which I had, the command in her company, and had always given her a true account of my amuse- ments, but without alarming her, by explaining my motive in as- sociating with Mr. Warner, of whom I perceived she had but an indifferent opinion. She once cautioned me to beware of him, then recalled her words, and said, ' Since you visit no suspicious places I have nothing to fear, and will tly to discard my unfounded prejudice against him.'

' I have,' said he, ' a friend residing here, let us make anl unceremonious call. Perhaps you would like to see the interior of one of the finest hotels in Paris.' "I readily assented, and we soon -found ourselves straying through apartments where our own persons reflected from mirrored panels, on all sides, together with the lights, the gildings, the crimson damask, and the wavy elastic carpets, seemed to impart to my whole frame a bewildering buoyancy. "I soon found myself in the presence of'Mr. Warner's friend, who received me with great cordiality, and inquired if I were a relative of George Lysander of New-York?  On learning that I was a brother, his good will to me was unbounded. He assured me that Mr. George Lysander was the friend of soul. We then retired to a private parlor, where he introduced a lady as his wife, and another as her sister. These were- English, and not American ladies; but on learning that my name was Lysander, and a brother to the gentleman's most intimate friend in America, they treated me with the familiarity of an old acquaintance. They must have thought me a creature of a very moderate share of discernment, otherwise they would have been less profuse in their attentions. When about to take leave, I received a pressing invitation from the whole party to join them the next evening, in some very inno- cent game of chance, in which they occasionally amused them- selves.' I, at once, understood why the word I chance' was ap. pended to I games.! It was a hint that I must not come empty- handed ; and strongly suspecting this to be one of those gambling establishments where souls are wrecked on the cast of a die, I re- solved to ascertain the fact before I left the house, and to make this visit a conclusive one. Dissimulation was hateful to my in- most nature; and yet I dissembled on this occasion with an effect that brought- me to a knowledge of the - secrets of the I hotel,' in time to save me from a single grasp of their power.

( The former said I, ' would be far preferable, and would be givning less trouble than the latter! This was precisely what they wanted, and they led me through the mazes of brilliant apartments until we arrived at one even more dazzling than the rest. Here we found a party of four seated round a card-table, where the money was piled high, and the glasses sparkling with delicious wines. To these gentlemen I was introduced with much eulogistic ceremony, by Mr. Warner and his friend. As a special compli- ment to myself, I was invited to join their ' club.' This I consented to do the next day, saying that I supposed it would be proper to bring an initiation fee, and toolk my leave for fhe evening. While I was in this last room, I heard voices in other apartments some- times as if in high dispute, and once or twice I thought I heard that of William Carlisle. But the sounds were indistinct, and would have escaped my notice had I not been filled with appre- hensions for the safety of my friend. as I returned to our lodgings. Mrs, Carlisle was sitting up for me, and she anxiously inquired if I had found any traces of the haunts of her son? I answered truly that I had been in search of him, but found him not. Mrs. Carlisle was greatly distressed. She had not seen him for more than a week, although she learned that he was sometimes in the apartments of Mrs. Delano. "The next day I stood in wait for William, and accosted him as he attempted to pass me on the fust landing-place of the stair- case. He was descending in company with Mes. Delano, from her parlor. I saluted him kindly, and intimated that his mother was unhappy in consequence of his long absence from her. "'I will go and see her this moment,' said he, I know I have done wrong in keeping away so long.' And he, notwithstanding the remorse visible in every line of his countenance, looked smi- lingly into the face of Mrs. Delano, and seemed to plead that he might see his mother. "'Not now, love,' said she, I you know that we have, an en- gagement. When we return I will accompany you.' "It was then late in the afternoon, and I knew that I should liot see them at Mr's.

They first went to the Banker's, where the Carlisles had letters of credit; from thence to the very 'hotel' into which I had been introduced the night before. "This was enough. I returned home, and endeavored to, cheer the spirits of the unfortunate mother. But no, a heavy fore- boding lay at her heart. Her children had been always attentive, always loving, always kind,-how, then, could her darling William treat her thus            . "In the course of the evening I received a note fitom Warner, requesting the favor of my company, according to previous ar- rangement.' I wrote to him, in answer, that my attention on Mrs. Carlisle was absolutely indispensable that evening. "The next day I again sought William, and reminded him of his promise to see his mother. 'Not without me,' said the strange woman, for he seemed desirous of seeing her alone. ' I go with you,' said she, taking his arm; and we all went together. Mrs. Carlisle, on seeing her son with the woman, who regarded her with an impudent stare, was affected nearly to fainting. William sprang to his mother, assisted her to a chair, kissing her, and asking a thousand pardons for his late neglect. -            I "t 'Upon my word,' said Mrs. Delano, looking at them with a most contemptuous smile,4 a farce without a fee!' "William appeared to feel ashamed of his filial weakness, and seating himself at a distance from his injured parent, thus remarked, ! looking at Mrs. Delano all the while: ' When the son becomes a man, his mother must no longer expect his undivided attention'  'Certainly not,' added Mrs. Delano; 'no young man of spirit could longer have submitted to the leading-strings of maternal authority than you have done.' "' I do not understand you, ejaculated poor Mrs. Carlisle. 'Is he not still my own darling son?. And must he not love me now that he is a man? Will he forsake me, and make my old age miserable by his unkindness?' And turning to William, she said, 'Oh! what is this? Is it not some fearful dream?'        "'It is quite time,' said Mrs. Delano, 'that we should under- stand each other. Your son is no longer the dupe of your pious restraint. The tyranny which you have exercised over him, both in his temporal and his spiritual concerns, is now at an end, and nothing but a deep-rooted fragment of the awe, which I hope this interview will expel from his mind, has prevented his making  i   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      261 down to you, that I have, for three weeks, been his lawfully wed- ded wife." "Mrs. Carlisle, in the bewilderment of her woe, stretched out her hands to her son, entreating him not to forsake her for one so unworthy. She had not finished the sentence, when the new wife arose, and taking the arm of William, desired him not to expose himself to the 'fury of his mother!  'What an uncontrollable temper she has!' said the impudent woman, as she drew him towards the door, when Mrs. Carlisle cried after him, 'O, Wil- liam! William, do not leave me thus. I will receive her as a daughter. I will love her, only do not forsake me!' ' "Forsake you!' said the vile woman. 'You, a mother! from whose eternal contentions your children found no rest but in the grave,-still clinging like a vampire to the one for whom there is a prospect of escape' "' (Speak not thus to my mother,' said William. 'I never in- tended, in describing her care and watchfulness over us, to say that the restraint we were under, brought on disease and death. I only meant to convey the idea, that my late wider range of liberty had restored me to a state of health, incompatible with the re- ligious and sober life which our family had been accustomed to lead? "' So then, you retract your late account of your sufferings a sneered the true vampire. "' I should be glad to see peace between you and my mother,' murmured the poor victim. 'If she will not interfere with our affairs, I will try to endure her,' said the creature,-I cannot call her woman.   But you certainly will not allow your wife to be insulted, even by your mother. And do but see how pale she is with anger! I shall leave, or the tempest will burst on me, and I cannot bear conten- tion.' And again she hurried him towards the door, at which he turned round and saw his mother, pale indeed; her hands clasped in agony, and her eyes straining after him with a look of despair. Towards this distressed mother, the creature at his side pointed her finger; and he, under the demon influence, thus addressed his once honored, his most exemplary parent. ' I will not see my wife insulted. Go to your closet, and there, on your knees, make your peace with God, and ask His forgiveness for your crimes committed against your children.' ,They then left the room, and in the course of the day departed from the house.9"   262        CHARACTERS UNVEIIEDn; OR, Mr. Lysander was now as little inclined to speak, as we were 1 to hear.

Mr. Seabright, after sit- ting for some time in silence, bade us a faint "good night," and retired. Mr Lysander,with looks haggard and shrunken, brought the Bible, and attempted to prove by the wisdom of Solomon, that - Mrs. Delano was the sole author of William Carlisle's transgres- sion, and seemed unwilling to leave on our minds the impression that 'poor Williamn was not constrained to act as he did. But we felt that there could be no extenuation of his treatment of his mother,-when Lysander reminded us of his sickness and death. Our indignation then gave way to pity. , I cannot say whether our sorrow was elicited more for Mrs. Carlisle than for her repentant son. We were grieved to the heart for both. Dr. Dudley endeavored to comfort us by saying, that the suf- ferings of both parent and child had passed away when they en- tered that world, where the affections know no estrangement, and where the wiles of the wicked are forgotten.

So depressed and tender were our spirits the next day, that Mr. Sea- bright, who appeared to have passed a sleepless night, proposed a postponement of the relation for the interval of a week. But Dr. Dudley was of the opinion that the subject would weigh upon our minds with increasing heaviness, until the worst being known, and known as an evil past, a reaction would take place in our feelings, and the end of a week find us reconciled to the ways of Provi- dence.                               t   THE PUR  PLEASURES OBF PURB  MNDS,     203 CHAPTER XXXI.

' She took my hand, and laying it on her aching forehead, said, C 'I love you Lysander, in the place of my lost Julia. But my son is not dead, his place in my heart is not vacant, that it should be filled by another, and even were he removed by death, my wound- j ed affections could never bW healed by the balm of mortal consola-  tion.'  "I tried to bring his past good conduct before her, telling her - that a remembrance of that would remain as a consolation, when i his present undutifulness should be forgotten.    , "'Lysander,' said she, solemnly, ' no parent can be insensible of the kind and dutiful attentions of a child, however lightly friend- ship or benefits from any other source may be esteemed. The heart of the parent, treasures with pride and gratitude every kind word or act on the part of a beloved son or daughter, while the i earth pours forth her treasures in vain, and prosperity showers her blessings, without giving comfort to that father, or that mother, whose heart groans beneath the burden of a child's disobedi- ence.' "The same evening, after this first sad rupture, another note was handed me from Warner, with the information that he waited below for an answer. Without breaking the seal, I endorsed on the back of the note, the word ' Begone,' and returned it to him. "After the first day of grief, Mrs. Carlisle did begin to look to me for sympathy, for she had none other to look to, and my only pleasure was to serve and oblige her. She seemed much disposed to find palliation for the conduct-of her son, in the fact, that she too was at first deceived by the woman Delano.          : "We had, for several days, been left by ourselves, when one morning the banker, on whom Mrs. Carlisle and her son had let- ters of credit, called and inquired how much he was expected to advance; adding that Mr. William, Carlisle had already drawn be- yond the amount which his correspondent in New-York had named as the limit of his credit. And leaving a schedule of his receipts he retired. In summing up this catalogue, we found that William, to whom she had, previous to leaving New-York, given entire con  trol of her financial concerns, had so managed, that not a farthing would remain to her of all her earthly possessions. ,e   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     265 "Mrs. Carlisle, who had known nothing of poverty, or of a state of dependence, seemed to feel no other regret in the loss of her property, including even her home, than that it was occasioned by the undutifulness of her son, who, she had no doubt, had con- verted every thing into money, and either bestowed it upon his wife, or lost it at the gaming table. She seemed to take courage from the certainty, that he must discover the character of Mrs. Delano, when he had no longer the means of keeping in her favorl even though she had become his wife, and he would then naturally return to her. She began to compassionate his troubled mind, and to fear for his health. She desired me to go in search of him, and to assure him.-not of her 'forgiveness' for that word implied censure--but to assure him that nothing was wanting to make her happy but his return. "I made some inquiries, but to no purpose, and in the full be- lief that we should soon have tidings of him, we waited with pa- tience, and not without hope of his ultimate recovery from the de- lusion which seemed to have bound him to the will of that most atrocious woman.  We  conversed, with some degTee of cheerful- ness, on the prospect of a re-union. I had determined to divide my own patrimony with William, and that we should make it a joint privilege to support Mrs. Carlisle, in all the comforts and el- egances to which she had been accustomed, and which she so richly deserved. 'Several weeks passed on, and no tidings. At  length we learned from an emissary, to whom I had given fifty francs in ad- vance, and promised fifty more when he should discover him, that he was living in a  cottage near the banks of the Seine, as a ser- vant. Thither I hastened with all speed, bearing with me the warmest expressions of love from Mis. Carlisle, and ready to offer him a  share in my own worldly wealth. I discovered him, or the troubled likenessof himself, sitting in an arbor; in the rear of the garden. His   head was bent on his hands, and his elbows rested on his knees. I aroused him and gave him a warm embrace. He returned my  salutation, saying 'Lysander, I should have expected this generosity from none but you. But how is my mother?' Full of love for you as ever,;' I replied, ' and only unhappy while you are - absent.' I have ruined both her and myself,' said he, how then can I   go back  . ' No ruin at all, my dear William' I answered,  ' but only a piece of costly experience, from which both you and I  must make the largest profit.' ;I then made known to- 12   266       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, him my resolve of dividing with him, and urged him to accom-  pany me home. A strange gleam flashed from his eye, and a sin- gular expression of exultation, which, in another, I should have re- garded as an indiscreet operation of the mind, flitted over his countenance. I could not persuade him to go with me that even- ing, but he promised to be with us the next day. "Sweet and refreshing was the sleep of Mrs. Carlisle that night, and smiles of anticipation illumined her face in the morin- ing: and, to our great joy, when the breakfast hour came, Wil- liam appeared, and took his seat at the table. The happiness of the mother was beyond expression; a faint attempt at confession from the son, was hastily interrupted by a command to forget , the past.' She gave -herself up to unmingled happiness, and prophesied a greater degree of mutual confidence, than had ever before existed between them. "My assurance of future tranquillity was less positive, for I ob- served in the countenance of the prodigal,-not the candor which followed the misdemeanors of his boyhood; and though ready to confess, I thought I saw in the place of ingenuousness and contri- tion, a subtle purpose under a downcast mien, and a searching glance in place of a confiding look. But I endeavored to attribute these appearances to his deep sense of his moral and religious apostacy, and to a struggle in his own mind for the recovery of his ,lost self-possession. I could not allow myself to believe that Wil- liam Carlisle was depraved at heart. "He wandered but daily, sometimes in my company, but more generally alone. He preferred solitude to our society, and without being strictly melancholy or pensive, indulged much in reverie; but this habit, we believed, would wear away with the oblivion of his late attachment, and its unhappy results. He never mentioned Mrs. Delano, neither did we speak of her in his pre- sence. "As the summer approached, we reflected on the consequen- ces of our residence in France, as not having been, or likely to be  productive of good, and resolved to return to America. "In order that my promise to William should be made avail- able, if any accident should happen to me on the ocean, on the day before our intended departure I made over to him, by draft, one-half my property, which consisted of bank stock in the city of New-York. The ready money in -my possession, I also divided with him, expecting him to fit himself for the yoyage, and pay his X       Fi   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS,      267 own fare out of it; while I reserved to myself the pleasure of taking care of Mrs. Carlisle. But he disappeared that same day, and for more than a week, all our efforts to find him were vain. I visited the cottage, but found it shut up; and no one could tell me where the late occupants were gone. After a strict search, I discovered a woman, who had served there, in the capacity of housemaid, and who had been discharged the day after William had deserted us. From her I learned, that he went immediately to the cottage-and how great was my surprise and mortification, on being forced to believe, that the master and mistress of William Carlisle, were none other then Mr. Warner and Mrs. Delano, who there had assumed the relation of husband and wife. "I immediately returned, and related to Mrs. Carlisle these grievous facts. That he had sold my drafts, or that the two harpies, upon which he hung, had done so, I could not doubt. That, however, was of little consequence. My great anxiety was to assuage the grief of his distracted mother. She would not leave Paris until she ascertained his fate, believing that some ter- rible doom was hanging over him, and ceased not, by day nor by night, to wail in pity for what she termed his 'misfortunes.' I now commenced an inquiry into the character of Warner, and found that he was a gambler by profession, and often within the grasp of the law,-that he had just come out from an incar- ceration when he was introduced to us, as a gentleman recently re- turned firom a neighboring country. He had twice been put on trial for homicide; but as deaths from suicide so frequently occur in gambling-houses, that real murderers usually escape conviction fromn the want of respectable testimony against them, Warner was each time enabled, on the oath of his colleagues, to make good his defence. I further learned that a warrant had been out for some time for his arrest, at the suit of an English gentleman whom he had decoyed into the same establishment where he had intro- duced both William and myself; and knowing that he had much money on his person, after every effort to induce him to play had failed, attempted to take his life. But he, fortunately, made his escape, and immediately entered an action against Warner, as principal, and two women'as accessories. This accounted to me for the seclusion in which I had found them, and I doubted not that one of the women mentioned was Mrs. Delano, and that my gift to William Carlisle had affotrded them the means of making their escape.    268       CHARACTERS UNVEIeFD; OB, "After a diligent search, I learned that three persons of their i description had gone to Havre. The younger gentleman was de- scribed as being of fair complexion, and slender and delicate in person. That the lady in company was his wife, much older than himself, and very plainly habited. The other gentleman I knew to be Warner. I had no doubt that it was their intention to sail from Havre Ito some port in the United States. Mrs. Carlisle begged me to follow them, and ascertain whither they were bound. ! I made my way to Havre with all possible haste. I found that they had already embarked in the ship 'Diana, under the names of ' Mr. and Mrs. Carlisle,' and ' Mr. Lysander." The latter name was pronounced so queerly as to raise a gene- ral laugh, at which Mr. Lysander was much disturbed; and it was in vain that we apologized, and fell to abusing Warner for such unparalleled impudence, in making use of so respectable a name; for not until Mr. Seabright recalled our minds to the unhappy state of the good Mrs. Carlisle did we suppress our mirthful feel- ing. Her trouble and her sorrows brought us back to instant re- flection. "How light, how trifling is the human mind," said Mr. Seabright, "volatile in the midst of its deepest sympathies. Mr. Lysander was appeased, and resumed his narrative. "They sailed for New Orleans; and knowing what would. be the wish of Mrs. Carlisle, I determined to follow them. I wrote to her, advising her of my intention, giving her what money I had left in my bureau, and promised to return for her. I took my passage in a barque, which sailed a few days after the 'Diana,' and being a swift sailer, we arrived in New Orleans in advance of that ship.  "When the Diana arrived, I immediately looked over the list of passengers, and saw the names of Mr. and Mrs. Carlisle, and the other one. I made some inquiry at the different hotels, and : not finding them, I sent a young negro man to the house of Mr. Richard Burleigh, to ascertain if they were there. The man was informed by the servants that ' Mr. Carlisle and his lady were the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Burleigh.' . "That the object of the woman, in again receiving William as her husband, after cohabiting with Warner, and the talking him to New Orleans, I had no doubt was to make, through him, the acquaintance of Mr. Burleigh, for the purpose of accomplishing his ruin also."  "Have gamblersl' said Amy, "such a hate against all the    THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      269 world that they can have pleasure in destroying the happiness of such good men as was my father, and my uncle William 8 And why, when they have been successful in winning, do they not leave off their iniquitous practices?" "Gambling," replied Mr. Lysander, "is seldom productive of permanent wealth. A few may be said to rifle their victims until they can live respectably on the spoils, and then retire. But, gene- rally, the gains of yesterday are submitted to the chances of to- day; and the excitement attendant on the consequences of so in- significant a circumstance as the turn of a card, or the throw of a dice, produces in the mind a mixture of avarice, prodigality and hate, under the influences of which, every man who has either a fortune to lose, or a character to suffer, is viewed as an enemy, and becomes a prey if he fall into their snares. The coveted vic- tim, who is, morally or socially, out of the reach of their own de- coy, is often won by the allurements of their feminine auxiliaries. Gamblers often marry women suited to their purposes, that they may have them the more completely under their control; and such women, safe in the protection of their husbands, become profligate without censure, despoilers without incurring the penal- ties of the law, and avengers where designs have been frustrated. "In my anxiety for the safety of the Burleighs, I wrote to them, stating my apprehensions of an ill motive on the part of young Mr. Carlisle's wife, and warning them against such gentle- men as she might be inclined to introduce into the family. This letter, as soon as he had read it, was handed over, by Mr. Bur- leigh, to William and Mrs. Delano,fto whom it was the first inti- mation of my being in New Orleans; and they represented me to Mr. Burleigh as being partially insane, in consequence of an un- fortunate attachment for this same Mrs. Delano; and that since her marriage I had continued to follow her with evil intent. She made a statement on oath that I had threatened to take her life, and had me arrested. I was put in prison, and it was with great difficulty that I escaped a shaved head and a strait waistcoat in a lunatic asylum. The physician who was sent to examine me, being a  kind and judicious man, I was, through his influence, set at liberty, after five weeks'spent in a common jail.   270        CHARACTERS UNVFJLn i:; OR, CHAPTER XXXII.

"As I had been deprived of all means of information, even that of reading a newspaper, during my imprisonment, I had no idea of any thing that had transpired without; and my first care, after my release, was to learn something of my friend, as I still loved to call him. And if he was not my friend, he was the son of Mrs. Carlisle, and that was sufficient to secure my interest in his favor. My late mishap had rendered me cautious of future interference openly; and in the shade of evening twilight I walked past the residence of Mr. Burleigh; I had no other motive than to beguile my restless anxiety. "The windows of the house were closed, and the gates fastened. Evry thing wore the appearance of desolation.  I inquired of a   i neighbor if the family were absent, and learned in reply, that Mr. Burleigh had, a few days previous, committed suicide, in conse- quence of ruinous losses at the gaming-table. I inquired for Mr.  William Carlisle and his wife. ' Those excellent people,' said my informant, 'still remain shut up in the back part of the house with Ms. Burleigh and her children.' "I learned, in the course of the next day, that a number of trunks and bales had been sent from the house early that morning, 'by order of ' Mrs. Carlisle,' and that the removal of so large a quantity of goods at that hour had excited suspicions that all was not righlt; and information was conveyed to a merchant, of whom Mr. Burleigh had borrowed a large sum on the evening before his death. This gentleman sent an officer to follow, and make seizure   THE IPURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      271 of the goods, among which was found all the family plate, and other things of great value belonging to the house. On gaining an entrance, and questioning the servants, they ascertained that Mrs. Burleigh, in the excess of her grief, having retired to her chamber, in utter seclusion, the management of the house devolved on Mrs. Carlisle. Mrs. Burleigh, therefore, could have had no knowledge of the transaction. Neither had Mr. Carlisle, who had been sent by his wife the previous day, on some pretext, to Baton Rouge, and had not yet. returned. She was assisted during the whole night by a man, who was at once recognized as Sam. De- lano, a notorious swindler, and who had been discovered lurking about the premises in the early part of the evening, by an officer on duty. It is unnecessary to say that this man was ' Warner.' The act was a burglary, and warrants were immediately issued for the apprehension of both; but they were not to be found. "In the course of the day I became an inmate in the house of Mrs. Burleigh, and received from her every hospitality that her circumstances could afford. She had not previously known that I had been in Tew Orlauma tut umpol xed ma- to boe with her mo- ther in Paris. The letter which I had sent was directed to Mr. Burleigh, who immediately communicated the contents to his bro- ther-in-law;- and it was thought best, on consulting Mrs. Delano, to keep the whole affair a secret from his wife. This I afterwards learned from William. "Mrs. Burleigh was of the same unsuspicious and guileless nature as the whole of the Carlisle family. She lamented the late imprudent act of her brother's wife, assuring me that fraudulency formed no part of her character, and believed that the recent trans- action had its origin in a desire to save something for herself and her children, and was conducted with secrecy, knowing that she would never consent to the perpetration of a fraud on her hus- band's creditors. And her brother William, she was happy to say, was utterly unconscious of any clandestine movement on the part of his wife. "This last suggestion I believed to be correct, for it was evi- dent to me that the woman Delano was about to discard William; and the plunder, I was well aware, was destined for other appro- priations than that of benefiting the widow and orphans. I, how- ever, kept my opinions safely guarded, remembering well the dur- ance which their expression had lately brought upon me, and of which Mrs. Burleigh was still unaware. "In the little conversation   272       CHARACTERS UNVFIIED; OR, which she made of her husband's losses and consequent death, she spoke with gratitude of the efforts of her brother's wife, simul. taneously with her own, to withdraw him from the fascinations of the gaming-table, which, for two weeks previous to the catastrophe of his death, he had visited every night. "William remained with his sister, who knew nothing of his sacrifice of his own and his mother's property. She, doubtless, expected to receive help from them. With me he soon entered into a renewed bond of friendship, and acknowledged his errors without reserve. I was reconciled to him without the least de- mur, although his participation in the charge, which came very near winding up my days as a lunatic, was, in my opinion, an   i injustice, which not even his infatuation by the strange woman could excuse. But why remember his faults? Surely that would not tend to his reform. And now that he was no longer neces- sary to the prosecution of Mrs. Delano's designs on the prosperity  of others, he having no longer a relative or friend whom she had not nearly succeeded in despoiling, he would only be regarded by  I her as an incumbrance, a foil to the exercise of her future enter- prise. He was of that opinion himself; and I could perceive in him a slight indication of resentment; yet his unaccountable ad- miration of the sorceress led him to think himself unworthy of her regard, except so far as he could minister to her avarice. "It was supposed that Mrs. Delano had escaped from the city; and after William Carlisle had been sufficiently commiserated by the public for the misfortune of having so indiscreet a-wife, the excitement died away, and we were left to make the best of the means at our command. After laying and rejecting several plans for our advancement in some lucrative enterprise, we determined  to go into the cotton trade. With this intent, through the agency of a broker, I soon had my remaining funds in my own drawer; and we were looking about for a suitable location for our business, when early one morning, as I was sauntering along the levees, the noise of a terrible explosion sounded in my ears, and shook the earth beneath my feet. I looked backward to a spot where I had just passed, and saw a cloud of black smoke rising from the edge of the river, and the levee, as well as the water, was covered with cinders, burning splinters, and mutilated bodies. The air resounded with, shrieks, groans, and exclamations of horror. A powerful steamer, just in the act of swinging off from the wharf, had burst her boiler, scattering death and destruction in every direction. I   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      273 approached the scene with an awe only exceeded by my compas. sion, which prompted to save and to succor; and I rushed into the thickest of the confusion. Here an object met my view which paralyzed my limbs, and made my senses reel. It was the burned and broken body of Mrs. Delano! "My first distinct effort was to call aloud for William Carlisle for I was struck with the apprehension that he had been aware of the continuance of Mrs. Delano in the city, and had taken my money, and attempted, with her, to make his escape. Agaia and again I called him  by name, but he answered not. I had ex- amined all the dead and the wounded that could be found, and finally rested in the belief that he was among those who had been blown into the water; had sunk, and been carried by the current from the shore. With this impression I returned home. I ex- amined my drawer.  The money was gone. "That same afternoon, our dear little Wilhe was born.  I shall never forget my sorrow when I first took that lovely infant in my arms, and thought of his poverty and  my  own. What could I do? I was now   without the power of assisting either Mrs. Carlisle, or Mrs. Burleigh and her children. For several weeks I kept our extreme misfortune a secret from the latter, merely stating that ' William Carlisle had gone down the river.' I had one crumb of comfort during this time, and it was a wicked one, but I received it with a relish. It was a newspaper paragraph, - which ran thus  -- "'The citizens of Vicksburg turned out en masse, last evening, against the nest of gamblers that have for a long time infested that city. They hanged a dozen of them on the spot, sans cdrd- vmonie. The others made their escape. Among those who were executed was the notorious Sam Delano.  This man was a native of Louisiana, born of respectable parents, highly educated, comely in person, and of most specious manners. Addicted to the vice of gambling from early youth, he had brought poverty and ruin on his own father's house. He married a Miss Wilson, the sole heir- ess of a wealthy planter--a woman, who, to the most brilliant endowments of the mind, added an almost irresistible fascination of manner, but of a  character as reckless as his own; and together they beggared her mother, and turned her into the street. Delano was well known throughout the country, under different names, keeping alive the spirit of gambling in all the Atlantic cities. He had made several voyages to Europe, .accomplishing the ruin of 12             '       6   274       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, such Americans as were so unfortunate as to make his acquaint. ance. His mania for gaming was so intense, as to destroy within him every common principle of humanity. The cry of his de moniac passion for play, was ' victim! victim.' And with milliond passing through his hands every year, his poverty was his only ex- cuse for his criminal course of life.' "Such was the obituary notice of Sam Delano, alias Warner. I felt a curiosity .to know something more of the history of his wife. But she was not personally known in New Orleans, never havingheen a resident of that city. Butthe history of Miss Wilson, more recently Mrls. Delano, had once been a subject of much noto- t riety. It was supposed that she had died abroad. "In consequence of my poverty, I became disgusted with the world, and resolved to turn it against itself, but not against integ- rity and virtue. I resolved to travel the Western States, holding up to view the benefits of a cultivated intellect, and a morality founded in truth and justice, and an indifference to wealth with all its con- comitants. I did not realize that I should seldom find a heart like my own, broken up by sorrow, and ready to receive and to nourish the seeds of virtue and patience. I did not consider that society was made up of seekers of wealth, with hearts steeled against all arguments but those of emulation and thrift. "Of my brother I would not ask assistance for myself; but for those who were dearer to me than my own life, I could suppli-: cate, even though he spurned my humble petition. I wrote to him, informing him of all our misfortunes. I concealed nothing. I begged him, in terms which should have touched the hardest heart, to send for Mrs. Carlisle, and to provide for the Burleigh i family. I called on him in my despair, and promised never to ask a favor for myself as long as I lived. When about to go out on my pilgrimage of self-imposed duty, I took the dear little babe in my arms, and asked that his name might be called ' Willie.' All my resentment against my unfortunate friend had vanished,- all my affection for him had returned; yet the full name ' Wil- liam,' seemed to include his errors as well as his virtues. I there- fore softened it down to 'Willie.' The result of my mission is known to these young ladies. You may learn it from them. And now, Mr. Seabright, when the'weariness of the mind, and the lacer- ations of the heart which I have suffered in this relation, shall have found rest and healing, I will hear from you the subsequent history of William Carlisle;-but not now.

FoR  many days, Mhr. Lysander kept his bed; and when     he walked about, he appeared like one who had no tie on earlth. His nervous system  had become languid, and he seemed to feel him- self mentally impaired. At last he became fretful. H{e "hoped Ms. Wilson would never come back," he   ' could not bear Mrs. Wilson."  We  humored  him in every thing, and were so solici- tous that he should have his own   way, that he began to resist. "I had rather," said he, "have what I  don't want, than to be so indulged. It makes me feel so little." 1' I am glad to hear you say this," said Mr. Seabright, c" and now I   shall test your sincerity, by proposing that we have Mrs. Wilson home immediately. You know you can't bear her 8" "No, I  cannot," said Lysander; " and for that very reason I'll go myself and bring her home. A sharp word would be a stimu- lant after such a surfeit of kindness." We could none of us be offended with Mr. Lysander, and were still desirous of obliging him. True to his resolve, he went to Boston for Mrs. Wilson the next day. They came back in the most perfect harmonly, each extolling the good qualities of the other; and Mr. Lysander went so far as to claim our acknowledg- ment for the favor he had conferred in bringing back our "  vener- able friend.'9 And truly,'the return of Mrs. Wilson was a matter of comfort and consolation to us all. "She first flowers of May for my dear Helen," said Mr. Sea- bright, as he presented me with an elegant little bouquet on May   276       CHARACTERS UNWTT OD; OB, morning. "She loves flowers, and I suppose will soon be showing us that she has a penchant for white ribbons and lace also." I, knew well to what he alluded, and answered, with truth and sin- cerity, that I was not insensible of the happiness that awaited me; but added, that happiness had with me such an alloy of misery, that it almost deserved the name of the latter. He was silent for a moment, and then, half hesitatingly, said, "You will perhaps see, vour father in time to consult him in the choice of your ribbons." : He smiled with a seriousness, as if he thought it not quite right to deceive me; and seeing my absolute dejection, and my comning. tears, he said, "The May flowers were only a prelude to the news I have to communicate. Your father will be here in three days, bringing with him a heart overflowing with love for his daughter." He then left the room with such precipitation, that he did not see me going almost mad.  I cried "Joy, joy!" so loudly, that I brought all the house about me, and we all rejoiced together. So long had we sat under the clouds of grief, that the sunshine X of happiness dazzled and bewildered us. We had all been par-    takers in each other's sorrows, so now the pleasure of one was pleasure for all. We began to busy ourselves in making prepa- rations, each in our own peculiar way. Mrs. Wilson set about re- modelling her caps; and as "Mr. Burleigh" was said to be a man of some literary pretensions, she teazed me with inquiries as to what subjects of conversation would be most agreeable to him, probably intending to look into her own intellectual stores, and bring up something from the most choice department. Amy was diligent in household matters, full of anxiety for the comfort of "Uncle Burleigh." Mr. Lysander busied himself in arranging all his little memorials of Willie, so that they might be seen in a way to excite the strongestinterest. For myself, I only felt desirous that my first appearance should make a good impression on the mind of my father, not only as re- garded my behavior, but also my looks; and I consulted Mr. Sea- , bright, whose taste was unexceptional in matters of female dress, almost as often as I did my glass. He assisted me in plaiting my hair, first this way and then that way, until he thought nothing was wanting in its adaptation to the form of my head, and the shade of my complexion.  My dress was of his selection, a plain, black bombazine, with fine white linen wristhands and collar. "And now," said he, '" this dress becomes your peculiar style of beauty, which would be rendered inharmonious by much .   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     27 ornament.' "But," he continued, "how does it happen, that you should be so much more solicitous about your appearance be- fore your father, than before your lover?" I had by this time begun to understand the motives of my own actions, and answered him frankly, that when I first became acquainted with Dr. Dudley, his- tastes and his opinions were mat- ters of indifference with me; and that having gained his favor without attempting it, an effort to make myself more agreeable to him by a change in the style of my dress might appear vain and coquettish; but I was not ashamed to own that I did wish my father to see an improvement congenial to his taste, in my ap- parel, as well as in my manners. And I assured Mr. Seabright that where he approved I knew my father would be satisfied. The expected day arrived. I had been all night watching for the morning. I thought I saw a dawn in the east, and raised a light to look at my watch; it was but twelve. I said to myself, continually; "It must be day." It is surely morning."  I kept on thus until it was, indeed, the break of day, when, overcome with watching, I fell asleep, and the sun, ascending high in the heavens, sent in his beams to wake me at the hour of nine. Mr. Seabright had just left to meet my father in Boston; but scarce could he have reached that city when my dear parent was set down from a carriage at our door. I was so much overcome with joy that I could neither weep nor laugh, and yet I made a feeble essay at both. As I sat enfolded in his loving arms, Amy came forward, courtesied to her uncle, and expressed her pleasure in seeing him. Mr. Lysander also received him in such a manner as to show that his heart was in the satisfaction which he expressed abundantly. But what was my surprise, even while my head was swimming with transport, to observe Mrs. Wilson, who had thrown herself into a chair, and was laughing with an ill-suppressed "Hew! hew!, hew!" and a mirthful shaking of the whole body. And my mortification seemed to have reached an almost insup- portable acme, on seeing Barney standing in the door, exhibiting the most ludicrous contortions of countenance. Had a father or an uncle of his own just arrived from Cork, he could not have shown more unmistakable signs of recognition. Though gratified with the interestowhich those persons seemed to take in the arrival of my dear parent, I must confess that their manner of reception was lot only annoying, but somewhat marvel-   278       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR,             i lous. What could there be either in his appearance or in mine to excite such ill-timed levity? My father, who did not appear to be in the least disconcerted at this, to me, unaccountable behavior, with an imperious air ordered Barney to look after his luggage. A more respectful manner, and instant obedience followed. He then advanced towards Mrs. Wil- son, who was wiping away the tears of her merriment, and offered her his hand. I immediately arose, and introduced her as an elderly friend, who was very dear to us all. Upon this she burst into such an Uln- controllable fit of laughter that my father, as if from a natural impulse, joined in it. Amy and Mr. Lysander, from a feeling of complaisance, tried to smile, but this vagary of Mrs. Wilson had astounded them both. It was so inopportune, so at variance with her general propriety and good manners, that they could not conceal their vexation. After a while Mrs. Wilson resumed her usual placidity, and fell into a discourse with my father with as much freedom as if they had always known each other, both seeming equally to have en- joyed the mirth of the meeting, and now were determined to avail themselves of the pleasures of each other's conversation. But Barney did not find himself so readily reconciled to his own man- ner of testifying his joy. Whenever his eye met that of my fa- ther he was sure to encounter a frown. The poor, well-meaning fellow looked dejected in consequence, and Mr. Lysander showed visible signs of resentment that a stranger should assume such command over Mr. Seabright's servant, and give him such looks of displeasure only for allowing his visage too much freedom of ex- pression, while Mrs. Wilson had behaved with actual rudeness, without giving any offence at all. I was proud of my father, he looked so well; and I could not help thinking that one half my former vanity came through the flattery of the widows and spinsters of Philadelphia on his account. He was now fifty-five years of age, but appeared much younger  He was of middle height, and of full, but not corpulent figure. I hair was partially gray, and combed back from his elevated fore- head. His complexion was rather pale than ruddy, and his coun- tenance more expressive of thought than of care. He was dressed, as usual, in an expensive style, but with the simple exactness of a gentleman. His manner was dignified, but neither distant nor cold, P i'    '      ,     . I,;   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     279 and his language the harmony of a combination between a style of unaffected elegance and a clear and manly voice. The first day of his arrival was drawing to a close, and I was expecting a visit from Dr. Dudley. I felt anxious for the return of Mr. Seabright, who had promised me his aid in the introduc- tion. But as he did not come, Mis. Wilson offered her services on the occasion; and to the great annoyance of us all, except my father, who seemed to enjoy all her eccentricities, she introduced them to each other with great ceremony, and then sitting herself apart from the company, laughed with more intensity than ever, Thle evening, however, passed off to the general satisfaction, and we anticipated the greatest happiness from the return of Mr. Sea- bright on the morrow. But he did not come the next day, nor the day after; and we became seriously alarmed, when my father assured us that he knew something of his movements, and that he would reappear in the course of the evening. At the usual hour for. casting aside the cares of the day, and giving ourselves up to the pleasures of the evening conversation, Amy remarked, "Our little circle would be complete were our good uncle Seabright but with us. I know I shall love you, uncle Burleigh, but you must not be offended if I always give him the preference." " Not at all, my dear," replied her uncle Burleigh, "I am glad to find that he has made himself agreeable to you, and hope he will continue to deserve your favor. But it is time for him to be here." So calling Barney, he said to him, with much gravity, "Go up to the brown wig-box, with our compliments to Mr. Seabright, and aid him down." Amy looked almost offended at what seemed to be an unbe- coming jest. Mrs. Wilson endeavored to appear unconscious of what was about to take place; and the rest of us regarded each other with a mixture of wonder and apprehension. Barney was not slow in the execution of his order, and soon returned with the white wig, the flowing beard, and the bushy eyebrows of our dear old friend, dangling in his hands! We looked upon them with astonishment, almost with terror, but no words were wanting to explain the mystery, and we all felt a sudden sense of irreparable loss, for Mr. Seabright had acquired for himself, as Mr. Seabright, a character and an affectionate interest which it was hard to re- linquish in favor of another name, and another exterior. Amy, perhaps, well defined the general feeling of void when she said,   280       CHARACTERS UNVETTED; OR, "I love and admire myv uncle Burleigh, but I aln not willing to believe that uncle Seabright was not himself. I want him too." Notwithstanding the disappointment, there was one to whom the transformation was like a full reprieve, and a restoration to favor without penance, and without confession. The father whom I had offended had been the witness of my contrition, and of the genuineness of my filial affection. He had, by securing my esteem and confidence, helped to form my character entirely in conformity with his 'own views of moral worth. I felt that I had no further oblation to make. Mr. Lysander, who had a slight touch of the romantic in his nature, was, after the first shock of surprise, highly delighted with what he termed a" transfiguration " but he soon began to complain that his old friend had been unfairly dealt with, and that the change was too sudden. "I should have been better satisfied," said he, "if I could have taken a formal leave of him," Amy, who did truly love her uncle Seabright, and did not ap- prove of artifice of any kind, said to my father, I shall never be reconciled to putting that dear good man out of the way; and I can never have the same confidence, and be so familiar with you, a strange and handsome gentleman, as I was with him, so old-look- ing, and so good-natured.' 'Neither can I' said Mr. Lysander; " and I feel as if Mr. Sea- i bright had been most shabbily used by Mr. Burleigh. I should never have loved him as I did had I not supposed that he was the true brother of Mrs. Carlisle, although he was a right clever old fellow of himself." It would give me great pleasure, said my father, who cer- tainly felt a little disconcerted, " to restore him to you; but as there cannot be two of us, you will excuse me for giving myself the preference. There can be no Mr. Seabright hereafter.  The next day we were allowed to examine the disguise, which we had once regarded as the ordinary habiliments of the wearer, and which now, odd as they appeared, we could not look upon but with a feeling of respect. We had associated with them wisdom  and kindness; and we handled them gently, and put them care- fully away, not without a sensation of sadness, which we could not overcome with all the efforts of our better reason. ^:'   TH E PURE PLEASURES OF PUREB MND6.        281 CHAPTER XXXIV.

IN the evening we listened to the following narration, given in a voice which, relieved from  the obstruction of a borrowed beard, had resumed that clearness and sweetness of tone for which it had ever been remarkable: "I left you, my child," said my. father, addressing himself first to me, " that we might both have a season for reflection, and, as Providence has directed it, for reformation. I had, indeed, received information from abroad of some losses, and I took the opportunity to impress on your mind the necessity of being prepared for further reverses, should they fall to our lot. I had never seen Mis. Car- lisle or any of her family, knowing only that my brother, who lived in New Orleans, had, at a time when I was absent in Europe, married a lady of that name in New-York. I returned home, and a few letters passed between us, when I again left for England and Germany; and after an absence of five years I returned, and -learned that my brother had deceased, and also his wife,--that his children were living near Salem in comfortable, but not in afflu- ent circumstances.  I gathered these particulars from Mr. George Lysander of New-York, to whom I was directed by persons who had been acquainted with Mrs. Carlisle and her family. On my return to Philadelphia I wrote to that lady, asking that I might have the privilege of serving her if she was in any need of assist- ance. She answered me in a sensible and grateful manner, but thought herself and family sufficiently piovided for, and that it  282       CHARACTERS UNVEIIED; OR, would be more conducive to her happiness to live on a little than to make herself a heavy burden to her friends; and again, she thanked me for my kindness to herself and to the orphan children of my brother. I was not a little puzzled by this portion of the letter, and sometimes I deemed it the irony of a proud spirit. Several letters afterwards passed between us, by which I found her to be a lady of no ordinary abilities, and I recommended the pe culiar chasteness of their style to my daughter, as being worthy of study and of imitation. But as there seemed to be in them a studied avoidance of all allusion to her pecuniary affairs, I also be- came silent on the subject. "With the arrangement for my daughter to becomea mem- ber of her family, I forwarded a sum of money by our Quaker friend, sufficient to defray all her expenses for one year, leaving it to the discretion of Mrs. Carlisle. This she returnied to me but a few hours before she died, saying she found it perfectly convenient to support the daughter of Mr. Burleigh, without making use of the money which might be of service to him in his misfortunes. She, moreover, asked me to assist him, and to be always a frieud to Helen. I found she was under the impression that it was I who gave her the cottage, and made provision for herself and family. I would have undeceived her, but she sank, and conversed no more."  And was it not you," said Amy," who was my grandmother's unknown friend ." "I would to heaven it had been," he replied; " but to a better man than your uncle Burleigh belongs the merit of that worthy act. I never knew until I came here, that it was not a saving out of her own or my brother's estate." "Then;" said Amy, " it must have been my uncle Seabright. I cannot believe that you are him yet."      ' "I almost regret," said my father, " that I have resigned my metamorphosis, for I am unwilling to lose any portion of the favor of Amy." "If you please,' said I, " let us see you as Mr. Seabright once more." "I should be happy to oblige you, my dear," he replied, "but I cannot, with any sort of propriety, comply with your request for I am well aware that the same covering, which once appeared respectably old-fashioned, would now be the height of the gro- tesque."   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      283 "Do not, I pray you," said Amy, "apply so disrespectful a word to that venerable appearance." "I will not again, dear Amy," said my father, " and now allow me to proceed with my story. "I had never known the maiden name of Mrs. Carlisle; but the name of my agent in London, he whom I most particularly wished to see, was Seabright. On my arrival I was informed of his recent death. His affairs were not left in so disastrous a state as was at first apprehended; but he had been defiauded to a con- siderable amount by an absconding partner. I learned that he had left his property, after the payment of his debts, to a nephew of the name of Carlisle, who was described as a most disconsolate young man, and who had been residing with him. Taking an interest in the name, I traced out the hotel of the nephew; and after having learned something of his habits and character, I made myself known to him. He related to me, without reserve, the his- tory of his transgressions, and expressed the strongest desire once more to see his mother, having learned from me that she was still living. He had not dared to seek her, if alive; and he had felt that he could not bear the confirmation of her death. So great was his sense of the wrong he had done her, that he could not believe himself forgiven. I endeavored to prevail on him to write to her, but that he could not do. Yet he was not inclined to converse except his mother was the subject. He described her as I afterwards found her, one possessed of every trait that could adorn the character of a woman. He made mention of Mr. Ly- sander with the warmth of sincere affection, and with that admi- ration of his conduct which none but a lover of true and perfect goodness, with a chastened and devout heart, can feel. Whatever had been the errors of that young man, he had washed out the guilt by repentance and suffering. And though willing to suffer, his heart was melting with longings for home." "Why did he not come sooner?" asked Mr. Lysander, " and why did he not come as our own William Carlisle  He knew that he would be welcome as ever." "He did not doubt your kindness," said my father, "but his courage was gone. He felt that he had forfeited the confidence of all his friends, and only wished to be with them and die. I urged him, with the most tender entreaties, to allow me to inform his mother of his existence. But he wa ould not suffer it. While she thinks me dead,' said he, ' she is without fear of my further   284       C(HARACTERS UNVE!I n ; ORy offences. But I must see her. I have thought of visiting her in disguise, that I might enjoy her presence, without torturirg her with. the recollection of my past delinquencies, and the fear of a j renewal of them.' I assured him that she would have no such fears. 'Ah, my friend,' said he, ' I was once as much averse to sin, as I appear to be at this moment, yet I was ensnared, and what guarantee can she have that I shall not, when reinstated in her favor, again break her heart? No, no. I must see without alarming her. Eleven years have passed since she saw me, and during that time I have grown in stature, and am otherwise much altered; and by changing the color of my hair, and letting my beard grow more about the face, surely I can go into her presence without terrifying her with the recognition of her unnatural son. And the more especially am I secure, since she believes me dead. Assist me, my kind friend, to some pretence for appearing before ! her, for I find I must go.'"              , "But you have not yet informed us," said Mr. Lysander, "how he escaped from the explosion; neither how he came to be under the protection of his uncle." "True," said my father," (but as he had never related to me, where he went immediately subsequent to the death of Mrs. De- lano, until after I came here, I had forgotten to give the relation more in detail. "When Mrs. Delano committed the robbery of his sister's house, and succeeded in eluding the officers of justice, he gave her up in utter detestation of her character and conduct. He made no attempt to discover her, and believed that she had for- feited his regard entirely,--that he could have no regret were she exposed to the severest penalties of the law. But having divested himself of all religious influences or restraints, the pious exam- ple of his sister made her presence a reproach, and her house a prison." "Ah," said Amy, " there was his great error. When he felt that he was free from the influence of that wicked woman, he should have given back his heart to God, who could have kept him from further temptation." To this my father replied, "When we slight our dependence on our Maker, we abjure his protection, and live at the will of the prince of darkness, who is not slow in teaching us that we can sus-  tain ourselves. So with William Carlisle. He was full of good resolutions, and felt willing to make all the atonement in his power   THE PURE PLEASURES OP PURE MNDS.      285 for the wrong he had done his mother and friends. Yet he trusted his reform to the absence of temptation, rather than to the restraining mercy of a Higher Power; and when he discovered that there was a prospect, through the generous intentions of Mr. Lysander, to make himself of momentary consequence to Mrs De- lano, by despoiling him of his last dependence, he immediately put himself in search of her; and so lynx-eyed is love-for we must do him the justice to say that it was love-that in less than twenty- four hours he discovered the place of her retreat"Looking at Ms. Wilson, my father hesitated. "Go on," said she. "With me time has worn off the barb of past recollections." "William Carlisle found the object of his pursuit, in the third municipality of New  Orleans. She was with her mother, in a small and neat dwelling, situated among the huts of the Spanish fishermen which abound in that neighborhood. She received him coldly, and only gave his name to her mother as 'William,' say- ing that he had once been in the service of Mr. Delano. He returned home, and prepared a letter, informing her that he had a prospect of obtaining some money,---perhaps a considerable sum. He carried the letter, and slipped it into her hand, unseen of her mother. After this she received him with more kindness, and in- formed her mother, in his presence, that he was to receive some money within a  few days, from  Mr. Delano, who was then at Vicksburg, and would go with her, as a servant, to that place. "One evening, Mr. Lysander called William to his chamber, and displayed before his delighted eves the money he had just re- ceived, and felicitating himself, and all for whom he cared, on the good prospect before them, he placed it in a drawer, and telling William to prepare for business in the morning, bade him  to be cheerful and happy, and they both retired to rest. "Early the next morning, William rapped at the casement of Mrs. Delano's window. She opened it, eagerly asking if he had the money  He   answered byplacingit in herhands. 'And now let us fly,' said he. 'The steamer leaves for Vicksburg at eight o'clock.' When on board she said, 'I think I  had better go alone, as you may chance to be pursued.' But he resolutely re- fused to leave her. There was no time for parley,-the boat was putting off. William was blown, by the explosion, on board an- other steamer, with very little injry . He heard and knew the voice of Mr. Lysander, calling him by name, and saying that Mrs. Delano was dead; but he dared not to come forward. The vessel   286       CHARACTERS UNVRtTTFn; OR, in which he found himself, was also leaving the port, and bound for Havana. She was crowded with passengers, and they were quite down the liver before it was discovered that William was on board. He was truly bewildered with the terrors of his situ- ation, and was much compassionated by all around him. They assured him that they were not surprised at his having lost himself in the confusion, which had scarcely begun to subside, when their vessel left the shore. He was provided with clothing and other things necessary for his comfort by the passengers; and a collection was taken up for him when they arrived at Havana. With that money he went to London, having learned from Mrs. Burleigh, that an elderly gentleman of the name of Seabright, who had for- merly transacted business for her husband in the West Indies, and whom she believed to be her uncle, now resided there. This supposed uncle, William determined to find, and was successful. On making himself known, he disclosed all his errors, and threw himself upon the mercy of his relative. Mr. Seabright was child- less and uncared for in the world. His long absence from his kindred had worn away the natural ties of affection, but he re- ceived William into favor, and finally adopted him as a son and ! heir.  "William tenderly loved his uncle, who was a pious and kind- hearted Christian, and by him he was led back to. his former faith and habits of devotion. His venerable relative even went so far as to advise him to pursue his first intent of preparing himself for the ministry." 'A deep declension like mine, said William, ' may admit of a return from the apostacy, but the apostate, how- ever sincere his repentance, must ever feel himself unworthy the calling of a pieacher of righteousness.'" "He was perfectly right," said Mr. Lysander. ' He who has  done wrong should show the sincerity of his repentance by leading a new life, and not by putting himself up as a light unto others; and his humility will not be the less apparent from his silence on the subject of his past vileness. .I do not like to hear a man speak too freely of the errors he has abandoned, as if there were more merit in the reformation, than demerit in the sin. I shall never believe that black can be made whiter than that which has never been dyed."                          ; "The death of his uncle," continued my father, "threw him into a state of utter despondency, and it was thus that I found him. I could not object to his innocent device of seeing his mother, ;i   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      287 incognito, for it would be easy to make himself known, as he gained confidence in the merit of his own repentance, and after he had acquired her sympathy as an unfortunate stranger. And my own ardent desire to be with my daughter, a desire perhaps aug- mented by observing the deep-toned affection of William Carlisle for his mother, led me to the design of personating Mr. Seabright, and of thus procuring for us both a reception from Mrs. Carlisle, and a home with those we loved. I took Barney into my service in Liverpool, after I had made the change in my outward appear- ance, and he had no idea of my being any other than that I seemed. On our way firom Boston to this place, we passed through the town of Lynn, and there I left several large trunks, containing among other things my usual wearing apparel, and it was there I went when I made the change, and that was the luggage which I brought with me when I came in my own character. It was not so strange that Barney should know. me, but that Mrs. Wilson should so readily discover Mr. Seabright under so great a change of exterior, did surprise, and her good humor on the occasion, amuse me not a little." Dr. Dudley, who seemed to have listened with more interest to Mr. Lysander's tirade against a displaiy of repentance, than to any thing else, remarked that it was to be regretted that William Car- lisle should have carried his self-distrust so far; "But I believer said he, " that the truly aggrieved for sin, and the conscience-chas- tened penitent, while full in the faith of the forgiveness and love of God, often sink under self-debasement before mankind." "True repentance," said Ms. Wilson, "is always humble, al- ways distrustful of its own genuineness. This was the case with our late unfortunate friend; he had not confidence in the sincerity of his own amendment, It was for this reason that he felt himself unworthy of being acknowledged by his mother until his last mo- ments, when he could seal the certainty of his reform, by dying in her sight." The last remark of Mrs. Wilson seemed to touch us with a sudden tremor, from which she relieved us by saying, You will now allow me to explain my own position with regard to my daughter-- Mrs. Delano. "After she and her husband had despoiled me of all my pos- sessions, I went to New Orleans in search of a negro man named Jotham, who had been my slave, but having married a fiee mu- latto creole, I gave hiim his frecdoml, and soinething towards house-   CHARACTERS UNVFBJT P; OR, keeping. Being industrious and prudent, they soon made them. selves owners of a small house in the southern suburb of the city. To them I applied for a shelter. They received me kindly, de- meaning themselves as servants, and treating me with all the re- spect due to the mistress of the house; and for my sake they re- ceived and gave protection to my daughter, of whose residence in the city I obtained a knowledge from a servant in one of the gambling houses. This man, on seeing Delano at his old haunt, gave information to Jotham, that the husband of his former young mistress had returned to the city. I could not resist the desire to see my daughter once more, and I sent a note by the man to De- lano, asking an interview with his wife if she were with him. But I did not see her until she came to me for protection, neither did I know of what had taken place. I did not know that the William who passed as her servant, was a relation of the Burleighs, or that he had done any wrong. I was not, at that time, in the habit of reading the newspaper gossip, being too much afflicted in my own mind to take an interest in the affairs of others. But I heard the noise of the explosion, and on inquiry, I found that my daughter had fallen a victim, and I supposed, the young man also. But the moment I saw Mr. Preble I knew him; yet it was not until I became an inmate of this house that I knew his real name. One day, when in conversation with Amy concerning the death of her parents, I learned that her uncle William was lost in the same explosion in which perished Mrs. Delano. I then knew that Mr. Preble was no other than the son of Mrs. Carlisle." "But how did it happen," asked my father, "that you should get together in the same neighborhood?" "Not feeling it to be my proper place," said Mrs. Wilson, "to be living with and on the means of those two colored people, and recollecting that a small legacy had been left by a distant relation, to the interest of which I was entitled, during my natural life, and which I had allowed to be appropriated to the use of a benevo- lent society, of which I had been a member, I now resolved to turn it to my own benefit. Jotham provided me the means of reaching Boston as a firstclass passenger in a good ship, and he gave me a small sum besides, exacting from me a promise to ap ply to him in case of future necessity. From his worthy com- panion I learned what should be the tenderness of a daughter. "When I arrived in Boston, I found a few who were ready to acknowledge me as a former acquaintance, but they were of those   /   TIlE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.  289   who, like myself, had tasted the cup of adversity. As I deter- mined to live within my own income, I thought it most prudent to retire from the metropolis; and a farmer in this vicinity offering to provide for me for the small sum of fifty-five dollars per annum, I took up my abode in his family, having but five dollars for all the contingent expenses of the year. I was well enough content with my fare, which was always comfortable; but knowing that a pauper burial awaited me at death, I was ever unhappy with the thought of a desecration of my body, for I have none of that phi- lanthropy which would lead me to consecrate my mortal remains to the benefit or the advancement of science. I cannot tell by what chance Mrs. Carlisle became my neighbor, but to her Christian hospitality I was first indebted for the pleasure of her acquaintance; and after we became intimate, I often found relief in disclosing to her the history of my misfortunes, from which she must have learned how closely they were connected with hers, yet she never made it known to me, that to a member of my family she owed the desolation of her own." "She was too just and too generous," said Mr. Lysander, " to wound your feelings by a disclosure which could serve no other purpose than to cause you to feel unhappy in her presence. She must have felt a teiderness for you, knowing that you were no more accountable for the conduct of your daughter than she for that of her son." The grateful look of Mrs. Wilson showed that she felt the kindness of Mr. Lysander, and she continued:"It was not until I discovered the son of Mrs. Carlisle in Mr. Preble, that I became aware bow nearly I was connected with the author of her misfor- tunes; but to have withdrawn myself according to my first im- pulse from her society, would have required an explanation which might have led to unpleasant results. I therefore left the issue to time; and though my heart was pierced with sorrow, I tried to believe that it gave me no pain." "My dear good mother," said Mr. Lysander, "you have been a great sufferer; and had I known that there was a single spark of sensibility in your soul, I should have been your comforter. I always did like you; the life stirred up by your rebukes gave me a sort of manly feeling,-a light to resent, which keeps the spirit from growing tame. And yet I feel that I have wronged you, and shall not be happy until we have a making up. After the present excitement is over I intend to make a full confession, and 13  290       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; OR, I am sure that you will not only grant me absolution, but will ac- quit me of all intention to do you harm." "( You have your acquittal now," said Mrs. Wilson; and if Mr. Lysander has any faults, they are absolved by his own virtues." Lysander, who never felt that praise belonged to him, tried to make it appear that he did not notice the last remark of lMrs. Wilson; but I, soon after, saw them in close conversation. He was telling her that he intended to keep the cottage for his own, i and invited her to live with him, saying, "You must be taken good care of now, Mrs. Wilson, and you are so very old, that 1 have no fear of any body suspecting you to be my wife, or even my mother; butyou are so respectable in your appearance and conversation, that you will give dignity to my establishment, and I will call you 'gralndmother'" She smiled and nodded, and they looked upon each other with great satisfaction. All preliminaries being settled, I became, in due form, Mrs. Dudley,' and found the fortune, promised under such doubtful presages by Mr. Seabright, to be a real bona fide marriage portion from my father, as that sage adviser had foretold. Boston was chosen as the place of our residence, but nothing could induce my father to give up his associations in the city of "Brotherly Love." ( It is," said he, " the home of my happiest retrospections, for after having become acquainted with the learned, the elite, and the  - good, both in these United States; and in foreign countries, I must j acknowledge in sincerity, that in no other society have I ever found the intellectual excellence, the genuine hospitality, and the quiet refinement of the Philadelphians." It was at length agreed that we should reside with each other : alternately; we being his guests in winter, and he ours in summer. Amy was now seventeen, and, at her earnest request, it was ar- ranged that she should remain with me, and pursue her studies, for two years or more, under the instruction of a governess. 'We were fortunate in obtaining the services of a lady of high intel- lectual attainments, and the most unexceptionable and refined man- ners, together with great decision of character. Amy was aware that she was a little impetuous in her natural temperament, and assured us of her willingness to overcome that, and to improve her general demeanor, by submitting to all the exactions contained in "Uncle Seabright's" theory of educational discipline. The pro- perty left by Mr. William Carlisle and his mother was to be equally divided between Mr. Lysander and herself. Lysander to retain   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.     291 the cottage. He was sure he could never be happy in any other home. And then, "Mrs. Wilson"--he "must provide for her." My father and Dr. Dudley insisted on the joint support of Mrs. Wilson, but he resented the proposal with all the disdain he could possibly assume, when Dr. Dudley calmly informed hhin that hu- man nature was human nature through life, and that Mrs. Wilson possessed a pride of independence which she would never be able to overcome, as was evident from the circumstance of her having accommodated her expenses to the paltry sum of sixty dollars per annum, rather than receive assistance, which would impose any restraint from others." "And surely," added he, "you would yourself be unhappy to see that aged and high-minded woman kept in awe from a sense of obligation to you, and deprived of the freedom of speech, that hardest term of dependence." "True," said Lysander, "I did not think of all that; but she shall never be afraid of me; and, my dear doctor, let us so manage it as to make her think she is independent of me altoge- ther; otherwise, when she is civil I shall be unhappy, from the ap- prehension that a sense of obligation makes her so. I learned something of the meanness of living on the charity of others when I was lecturing on contentment out in the west; and I can assure you that want without indebtedness is preferable to luxury at the expense of another. The poor man who is. honest, owes nothing, and eats nobody's bread but his own, lives on good terms with himself, and quails before the glance of no man. But debt or dependence makes the image of God, however upright his in- tentions, or elevated his place in society, to tremble at the nod of his creditor or patron, and to loathe and shun himself as a thing dead, yet tormented with vitality." "I think," said Dr. Dudley, " that your figure is hardly over- drawn; and from a sentiment similar to that which you have so forcibly expressed, we would wish to make Mrs. Wilson indepen- dent of you, who are to be her daily companion and associate; and before whom we could not deprive her of a privilege, desira- ble in every stage of life, but esteemed an especial prerogative of z age, that of giving vent to, her feelings without embittering her bread. And we have considered, that with an annuity bestowed by persons with whom she has but little communication, she will have more freedom of enjoyment than under the immediate eye of the donor, however generous that donor may be in his appro- priations, or however guarded in his words against any intimation   292       CHARACTERS UNVTEILED; OR, that he is doing a favor. And should Mrs. Wilson at any time, or under any freak of discontent, desire to leave you, she will have the means of doing so." Mr. Lysander now began to think that he had real cause of  j grief. "Do you think it possible," said he, "that she will ever wish to leave a home where she has found the comfort due to her years, and the consideration to which her merits entitle her? And j for me-how could I dwell here alone?--a creature forsaken by every living memorial of the Carlisle family."         j "You forget," said Dr. Dudley, " that Mrs. Wilson is not a Carlisle. " "Iknow she is not," answered Lysander, "but then she is just the same to me as if she were. The cause which gave rise to her misfortunes gave rise to theirs also; and kindred afflictions always produce a sentiment like that of relationship; and I have now become used to her, and she seems to me like one of the family; and if she leave me, I may call upon the members of our household for ever, and no one will answer, for those who have not deserted me, lie too-deep to be awakened by the voice of the lone and friendless Lysander!" We were about to offer words of comfort, when Mrs. Wilson came in, and the feelings of Mr. Lysander certainly underwent a great change at that moment. He ran on with the greatest volu- bility in favor of the provision that had been made for her sup- port, assuring her that she was quite as independent of him as he was of her, and that there was to be no further accountability between them. And he finished by saying, "Now, Mrs. Wilson, is not this capital 8' The good old lady appeared so happy, that we regretted the- shortness of the time left her to fill up the measure of a very long life. Yet we have hope of many years of enjoyment for her still. i,   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.       293 CHAPTER XXXV.

MR. LYSANDER   had not received any communication from  his brother since he wrote to him from New Orleans.  He sometimes thought him unkind, not so much for disregarding him   as for ne- glecting  to send for Mrs. Carlisle, and attending to the young Burleighs.  He felt that the use he had made of his own property, though perfectly justifiable in his own mind, might appear almost criminal in the opinion of a man who kept his own money at in- terest; and he feared that the misconduct of William had preju- diced him against all the Carlisle family. Yet he decided that he had no cause of complaint against his brother, who had always borne the reputation of being a benevolent and worthy man. About this time  the news of his death came  through the public journals. Mr. Lysander was very much grieved, and recounted all his acts of kindness, together with his almost paternal love and care for him during his infancy and childhood, and he seemed to think that he was now in Heaven, making peace with the Carlisles. A few days afterwards he was summoned to New-York to take possession of his brother's effects, he being the sole legatee named in the will. After an absence of a  week, Mr. Lysander returned from New- York. He appeared thoughtful, and tenderly respectful of the memory of his brother, and seemed much inclined to converse on the subject of doing  good unto others.  "It is," said he, "too much the opinion of the poor, that no good is done but to be seen of men, and to obtain the name of 'charitable giver,' and to be gratified with the abject acknowledgments of the mortified and   294       CHARACTERS UNVF TIED; OR, depressed receiver. But I do believe that were all the secret doings of the wealthy laid bare, they would not present so selfish a picture as that drawn by the imaginations of the less fortunate. Many luminous spots would relieve the scene which is now supposed to be all darksome and withering." "It is true," said my father, " that there is hidden good as well as hidden evil among mankind; and the poor would be less envious towards the rich were they to enter into all their cares, and witness all the demands upon their charity. Were this to be the case, the miserly and heard-hearted would be found less nu- merous than they now appear. But, unhappily, in this, as in every thing else, in every community and among every order of people, the bad exceptions are viewed as samples of the whole class to which they belong, while the good exceptions are regarded as hap- pening by chance. All men, my dear Lysander, have a desire for wealth, and few know, until they have it in their hands, whether their hearts will be disposed to make a good use of it.' "Was it," said Lysander, " because I knew so little of my own heart, that in my poverty I drew false conclusions from my hope- lessness, and went about the country decrying the benefits of   wealth without makingone proselyte as a reward for my zeal and suffering? Was it through pride that I persuaded myself that I was etherealized above the desire of holding possessions, and of an ? honorable name, or of the means-of doing good in a pecuniary way? I have now come to believe, from the character of my brother, that it'is a blessing to have enough, and that there is pleasure in assisting others, and satisfaction in the certainty of a good name after death." To which my father replied; "Many persons pretend, and really do feel to despise riches and honors while they have no prospect of obtaining them; but when they become possessed of these things in their own right, they discover that they only hated them for the advantages they gave others over themselves. Men do sometimes reject offers of emolument and titles of dignity; but it is because that the refusal will either lead to a more general popularity, or confirm them in some darling prerogative. We are not all culpably avaricious, nor vainly ambitious; but it is so natural for us to de- sire wealth and the approbation of mankind, that few or none but those who despise the world because they have given the world occasion to despise them, can be insensible of the advantages of a competence and an honorable name." "The remarks which you have just made," said Mr. Lysander, .   THE PURE PLEASURES .OF PURE MNDS.      295 i' may admit of general application; but I do not feel that my case comes under their provisions, since I have never given the world occasion to think either good or ill of me, not having been a seeker of fortune, or a candidate for fame.-Ah, excepting mv lectures! but otherwise the world has been kind enough to take no notice of me. Yet after all," continued he, musingly, 'there must be a most refined satisfaction in doing-good so secretly that not even those who are benefited can know from whence the good comes. It saves all the annoyance of receiving thanks, and all the confusion of hearing one's own praise. And an honorable name, -why that is an honorable name which is above reproach." In saying; this, Mr. Lysander-put a small bundle of papers into my father's hand. Mrs. Wilson, who was present, and had been an attentive list- ener, remarked, "The word 'honorable,' Mr. Lysander, has a posi- tive signification, as much so as the word notorious. A man be- comes honorable from his wealth when he makes it beneficial to many; or he may obtain honor from his meritorious efforts for the public good.  But the poor man, however irreproachable his cha- racter, if no opportunity offers to bring his worth into popular no- tice, he is' unknown to common fame,-therefore, not honorable. And he who, without a public character, having  much of this woild's goods, yet hoards from  public admiration, and bestows them in private, where there is the most need, may certainly be a good man, but he cannot be said to be an honorable one. Merit is an inherent quality, but honor is an appendage in the keeping of others." "Honor, or no honor," said Mr. Lysander, "I do most solemnly abjure all display in charitable appropriations, all connection with charitable associations, where money is given for the purchase of renown, rather than from sympathy with the suffering, where the right use of God's free gift is made an outlay for praise." ( Then,' replied Mrs. Wilson, " you would allow a man to assist in a charitable enterprise, if it could first be made clear that he was actuated by a pure and disinterested motive; but how are we to ascertain whether a man's motive be good or otherwise 2" "Goodness is silent in its own praise," said Lysander "and it is difficult to point it out; but when we hear of great charity through the trumpet tongue of the press, we may be sure that the motive would afford but little confirmation of the merits of the deed, which, under such circumstances, is always to be mistrusted,   296       CHARACTERS UNVEITEDP; OR, since an effort, which adds nothing to the charity, is made to be seen of men." "Again I dissent from you," said Mrs. Wilson; ' for although some do give to he seen of men, and to hear their own praise, there are others whose names are equally sounded abroad, yet who do good from a motive that would not shame the angels. They do good for the love of Him who is goodness itself, and from whom they receive pitying hearts, without which wealth is not a blessing. In them exists a benevolent desire to give succor, or advance the prosperity of some portion of their fellow-creatures. Many give in concert with others, and thus do good in places where their own . solitary efforts could never reach. Arid the publicity of their names makes it binding on others to follow their example. But that there is less cause for suspecting the motive, when the good is done in secret, I will allow." My father, who had been examining the manuscript given him  just now, came forward, and restoring the papers, said, "Blessed and ever honorable be the name of' George Lysander. And you, his worthy brother, how bountifully has Heaven .rewarded your generosity, and your patience in adversity--not so much by giving you a fortune, for that you will never learn to appreciate, but by the sweet recollections of the efforts you have made to serve those whom you have loved, as few have the purity of heart to love, and now by giving you this exalted token of the worth and be- nevolence of your nearest relative."             ! Mr. Lysander could only say, "I knew you would like him." He was then going to his room, but he suddenly turned and came back. "I do not like," said he, "this manner of reading prayers that you have now,-extemporizing is sometimes better; and I feel to-night as if I would hear some voice making my case a subject of peculiar interest." Mrs. Wilson immediately arose. We all did the same. She kneeled. We followed her example. Through her words all our hearts were drawn Into communion with our Maker. Mr. Lysander retired, evidently satisfied; and we felt that Mrs. Wilson was certainly very dear to us.  We made some inquiry concerning the manuscript; and my father, feeling himself authorized to relate the facts which it con- tained, thus informed us:             . "Mr. George Lysander, immediately on the receipt of his bro- ther's letter, which at once addressed itself to his heart, and drew forth his warmest sympathies, wrote to a friend in New Orleans, !   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.      297 giving him orders to supply Mrs. Burleigh with every thing neces- sary for her comfort. He, at the same time, inclosed a draft on a banker in Paris, in a letter to Mrs. Carlisle, inviting her to re- turn to New-York, and promising to send for the Burleigh family, and to provide for them altogether. Unfortunately his letter did not reach Paris in time; Mrs. Carlisle having, with her limited means, and suffering great hardships by the way, gone first to London, and from thence to Boston. This he ascertained, after having waited in daily expectation of her arrival, for more than six months. His letter, containing the draft, was returned, but he could trace the movements of Mrs. Carlisle no further than her landing in Boston. "Meanwhile Mrs. Burleigh had died of consumption, leaving three children, the youngest but eight months old. He went to New Orleans, and found that the family had been well cared for through his order. He sought out the graves of the husband and wife, and placed over them  a memorial, that their resting-place might not be forgotten. A most excellent nurse had been pro- cured for little Willie, whom, with his two sisters, he left at board with a kind and considerate family to await his further orders. "Returning from New Orleans, he went immediately to Bos- ton, and after a week spent in unavailing search for Mrs. Caalisle, he returned to New York, in the hope that she might be found in that city. He had, however, commissioned one of the city officelrs of Boston, to leave no effort untried to find her, and to inform him of the result. Still continuing to make inquiry for her and for his brother, more than a year passed away, when he received information from his agent in Boston, that Mrs. Carlisle was living in C--   street, supporting herself by the manufacture of some little fancy articles. A young man, supposed to be a relative, had been residing with her, but he had left and gone to the South. Mrs. Carlisle lived in a most retired way, and appeared to have no associates, although the passing opinion was in her favor. "Mr. George Lysander was much aggrieved that neither she nor his brother had applied to him, but he could only account for their want of confidence- by supposing that in consequence of his letter not having been received by Mrs. Carlisle in Paris, they both felt that they had no friendship to expect from him, and had, from a natural impulse of pride, refiained from making their destitu- tion known; and he being a lonely bachelor, naturally diffident, and unwilling that a lady should feel herself under any obligation 13  '   298       CHARACTERS UNVEILED; Ol,            : to him, conceived the idea of making himself useful, without making himself known. He therefore immediately commissioned his friend in Boston to supply Mrs. Carlisle with every thing use- ful, and to negotiate for him in the purchase of some neat cottage and garden in the neighborhood. This was soon done; and a man and his wife were sent to New Orleans to bring the little Bur- leighs to their grandmother. A sum sufficient for their every com- fort was remitted to them quarterly through the post-office. "Mr. George Lysander well knew, that to provide for Mrs. Car- lisle, would be to provide for his brother also. He knew, from his attachment to the family, that he would make her house his home. He remarked in his journal that he, sometimes, had a very strong desire to visit them, but he feared it would look as if he came to claim their gratitude. "A will was found of a date prior to the last, giving to Mrs. Carlisle and her family an equal share with his brother in his property; but through the vigilance of his agent, he was apprised [i of the changes in relation to the inmates of their house, and of  the good fortune which had come upon them, through the arrival ' of a wealthy relative. He then made a new testament solely in   ( favor of his brother, remarking in his diary, that ' as there were young ladies in the family, it might be all the same.+ "  Amy col- 1 ored crimson; and we at once saw through the modesty of Mr. Lysander in not reading the manuscript to us, as he might have been expected to have done. Poor fellow! he had not the cour-  : age to be seen under such an insinuation. The very filrst appropriation of Lysander's money, was a thou- sand dollars to Jotham, the liberated slave of Mrs. Wilson, as a testimony of gratitude for his kindness to that worthy woman. He f next ran after the agent of his brother, who had so faithfully watched over the welfare of Mss. Carlisle. But his brother had anticipated his good intention by having bought the man a farm in the country, when he heard of the arrival of Mr. Seabright, and withdrew the vigilance which was no longer necessary, My father asked no justification for his apparent neglect of his i brothelrs family, for he felt it due to himself to say, that he was ignorant of their misfortunes, until he learned that the children were living with their grandmother, and that when he made an offer of assistance, the reply of Mrs. Carlisle, written under a mis- apprehension, seemed so like a haughty refusal of his aid, that he forbore to question her farther concerning the state of her pe- i.   THE PURE PLEASURES OF PURE MNDS.   a   299 cuniary affairs. "I wish," said he, "that I could have the half of such an excuse in palliation of my neglect of you. I did not begin wisely at first. Your happiness was my greatest consider- ation, and I thought it a proof of my love to grant you every in- dulgence. But the affections of children for their parents are not cultivated by allowing their desires to wander too much abroad in search of pleasure, and never did a father commit a greater error of judgment than I, when I expected those attentions from you, which could only have been the result of a different course on my own part. "After I left you as I did, with the determination to let time and privations work a repentance with you, reflection seized upon my mind, and my whole course of parental guardianship passed, like a panorama of errors, before my mental vision, and the cold manner in which I bade you adieu, visited me with the most poignant reproaches, relieved only by transient gleams of self-justi- fication. My unhappiness was insupportable, and I at last resolved on the means of studying your character, without apprising you of my presence, or of my design, as a stranger. I felt willing- desirous of finding in you those virtues which should absolve you from all blame, and throw on myself the entire odium of our sep- aration. I was still a fathbr, still loved the child, a perfect resem- blance in person of the most amiable and beloved of wives. I was made to realize, under the most painful sense of my previous ignorance of the intensity of my affections, that parents who truly love their children, can .no more recognize their own individuality of moral existence, since each child becomes a duplicate. "My   recent acquaintance with you, my daughter, has opened' to me the most secret recesses of your heart, and I have there found, among other virtues, a treasure of love for myself,-more than I could ask, more than I could hope for; but, I feel, not more than I can return." Mr. Lysander has become master of the cottage. He allows no alteration to be made on the premises, and not an article of furni- ture to be removed. Even my  piano he claims as being one of the "fixtures." The brown wig box, and all the antique habiliments of  "Jir. Seabright" are retained as mementos of his great re- gard for that 'favorite old gentleman ;" and in the same closet   300        CHARACTERS UNVS'TT n. with these, on a shelf in front of the door, stands the "Pilgrim tankard." Mrs. Wilson has straightened up, and walks to church without a staff; but in her rustling black silk, moves majestically along, slightly embracing the arm of careful Mr. Lysander. We are, at this time, all together at the cottage. It is still pleasant to sit around the same table, and at evening to unite in prayer, and in praise of Him whose past dealings we look back upon as the chastenings of love. With the gay world we have but lit- tile communication. A few friends, chosen not so much for their rank as for their worth, serve to keep up our intercourse with soci- ety. And there is now no want of interest in our domestie circle, for a young female, on whom all our affections seem to have con- centrated, has lately become a member of our family-for myself, I love her dearly, and am not envious when I see my father fond- ling her in his arms. Mri Lysander looks upon her with great admiration, and then goes to write sonnets on her innocence and beauty. Mrs. Wilson's face is wreathed in smiles whenever she sees her; and Amy is in danger of neglecting her books, she is so fond of her company. Even Dr. Dudley,--he loves her so, that he never comes in but he kisses her,--and then she has the sweetest smile! Surely, dear reader, if you should see her, you. would say she is a lovely creature. Her name is Sarah Dudley, and I expect she will call me "Mamma," one of these days. ADIEU. e   D. APPLETON & COMPANY have just ready the following N:EW WORKS FOR FAXILY READING.

Cloth, $1 50 Thi BB 8 work of absorbing interest, with regard to the varied incidents which mark progress of the characters who figure in it. The scene is laid in Italy, in the begir ut of the seventeenth century, and the tale of the Betrothed, to whose union obhlwfet are continually occurring, gives a vivid picture of the state of society, moral social, e- blious, and political,at that time. It is an admirable adjunct to history, furnishing a key to the strange events that occurred in the peninsula, during the prevalence of Span- ish dominion there. Manzoni has here truly realized his quaint idea of history-true his- tory, which  analyzes society to its elements-' taking prisoners by force the Years of Time, already dead; calling them to life, bringing them under review, and re-arraying them in battle array i' The descriptions in this tale are exquisitely beautiful, the morel and religious tone of a .ofty nature, and the path of the actors is bestrewed with every ossible variety of agitating matter-' battle, murder, and sudden death'-the bravo, or hireling assassin, the plotting monk, the venal and voluptuary noble, on one side of the picture; while maiden constancy, chivalric Devotedness, simple truth, and civic virtues brighten the other. It is a work which has made a greater sensation in Europe than that of any other writer of fiction, since the publication of the' Waverly series. We  teom mend it to the perusal of ail who have leisure to ,ose an hour or so in the company of the accomplished author, amidst the exciting scenes of life in Italy two centuries ago."- Soutar, Patriot. "This far-famed specimen of ftalian historical i smance is here presented to us in aw English form. The elegant simplicity of the style will render it popular, especially among the younger classes of readers, and its faithful but minute description of the famine, riots, and the plague in Milan, rival in force and pathos the pages of our own immortal Defoe. The tory is of the most natural and touching character-the plot beings the prointnge sparation of the betrothed lovers just at the eve of marriage. The date i'r&ther mom than two centuries ago, and the work gives a vivid portraiture of that lawles age.'-- Ath C   hronicle. , "We are delighted to meet with this masterpiece of modern fiction in a form whit ay render it accessible to the English reading public.
