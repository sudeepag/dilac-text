D., In the Cleri:' Office of the District Court of the United States for the E:astern District of Michigan. e FIRST EDITION-SIX THOUSAND.   PREFACE. WHEN an author presents the public with a new book, custom seems to require an apology for the product ol his pen. This apology should- embrace a brief state ment. of the theme, together with the reasons for its publica- tion. In compliance with this custom, wlGer; our readers the followig explanation: FIRST.-Our theme is Christian Baptism, in its various aspects and bearings SECOND.-We present it in the popular, or narrative form, for the following reasons:  1st. While there are many able works on this subject be- fore the Christian public, by authors known to fame,. they ad generally written in a controversial spirit, and in a doctrinal, or sermonizing style: a style well adapted to scholars and thieo- logical students, but not to secure the attention or enlist the sympathies of that large class who, most of all, need a guide and teacher-the young and inexperienced, and those not favored with the mental discipline needed to enable them to follow an author through all the-intricacies of lengthened ar- gument ; hence, however well, or ably written, -they do- not pass into circulation among the masses, and consequenty fail to exert the influence they otherwise would. . 2d, In like manner, sermons, though fraught with facts   (1  -         PREFACE. -and illustrations, however deeply they may interest an audi- ence during the time of their delivery, are, to a greater or less degree, ephemeral in their influence, and, unless often repeat- ed, soon pass out of mind. 3d. In a ministry of thirty years, the Author has felt the need of a work of this character, to put into the hands of those who need instruction on this point, especially young converts who are anxious to know their duty as to Bap- tism. And as no such work on the pedo-Baptist (one that holds to infant Baptism,) side of the question, has come to his notice, the Author has been led to prepare this work with the view  of meeting this felt-want, of Pastors and Churches. -In its preparation, the Author has been encouraged by several of his ministerial brethren-Presbyterian and Meth- odist-to whose inspection the first ten chapters were sub- mitted, expressing their cordial approbation of its style and spirit, and urging its early publication. Most of the facts and incidents have transpired in the Author's ministry, and conversations like those narrated here, have also taken place before him; but, for prudential reasons, real names are withheld, and others substituted. The title-THE JuDDX FAMi TYT; OP, AN EVENING VISIT, - AND WHAT CAM E oF IT-is adopted, as the most appropri- ate, from; the fact that the Judd family constitute the cen- a tral figure in the narrative. It is the aim of the Author to present the arguments on the pedo-baptist (Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyteiian, Congregational, Lutheran, etc.,) side of the question, in the simplest and most attractive form; hence the half conver- sational, half narrative, style has been adopted, to lead the mind of the reader on, and sustain the interest to the end;   PREFACE.            5 and also to show, in the strongest form, the errors of the idea that immersion is the only valid, or correct mode of baptism. The Author would acknowledge   his indebtedness to the following authors from whom he has drawn some of his facts and illustrations, often in their own words, but, from the style adopted for our work, has thought best not to designate them by quotation marks, viz.: "Beecher on Bap- tism," "' Hall on Baptism," "Apostolic Baptism," by Taylor, and "Household Consecration." After having conceived the general plan and arrange- ment of this Work, and written the first nine chapters, the Author fell in with, and examined, "Theodosia  Earnest; or, the Heroine of Faith," a work similar in .its general plan and style, but advocating the Baptist (immeision) side of the question; and the tenth and eleventh chapters are devoted to a partial review of that work. In the concluding chapters, the Author has introduced a class of facts bearing upon the general question, that could not be conveniently introduced in the former part of the Work, together with a brief re-statement of such argu- ments as were deemed the most important, that by making them more familiar without tediousness, they should be fas- tened in the mind.        ' Craving the indulgence of the critics for any defects, real or imaginary, and with earnest prayer that, with God's blessing, it may lead to greater unity among Christians, be the means of guiding inquiring ininds to the Truth, and of exciting the reader to more ardent desires and efforts for the read, the Spiritual Baiptism, the Author sends it on its mission to the Christian world.   PUBLsSHER' NOTICE.               : ' l HBE PubisHer o THn   JU D  MLY; OBT Al F^ ^x yVsi, i, A ND WAT CAM OF IT, in presenting it to te public, has the following reasons only to give for taking upon himself suci a responsibility.  Having heard the manuscript read by the Author, and believing it perfectly correct in its teachings hence calcu- lated to do good; and being well assured of its literary merits, he has most cheerfully undertaken its publication; for, with it done; therefore, hoping and praying that great good will result from its general circulation, the publisher bids it Godspeed upon its errand. er t AN ABO^ MistHd, 1869. *         w '1U it one tereor, hpig ad rayngtha geatgo pulse\isi   ERRATA.

'      THE JUDD FAMLY. CHAPTER I. IT WAS toward the close of a pleasant day in i the autumn of 1846, a stranger, apparently jaded and travel-worn, halted in front of Mr. Atkinson's dwelling. Iis horse and  carriage bore marks of hard service. In the back part of his carriage there was a large trunk, covered with dust, while in front sat an open basket well filled with books. He was evidently a Colporteur, and had called to seek their hospitalities for the night. He accordingly made known his mission and wishes, receiving their most cordial welcome. Mr. Atkinson's residence was in the pleasant town  of A--, on one of the tributaries of Grand River, Michigan. He   was one of the early settlers of the town ;, and,- as is the case with most pioneer settlers of a new country, had struggled on amid hardships and  difficulties, deprived of many com- forts and privileges enjoyed in older places. But, The Judd Family.   2   18       THEs JUDD FAMLY. by patient and persevering effort, he had overcome many obstacles in'the path to success, and at the time when outr narrative begins, was in a thriving g and prosperous- condition. He had early given at-  i tention to the cultivation of -fruit and ornamental trees, and this prudent forethought had met a rich X reward. His dwelling was surrounded with shade- trees and ornamental shrubberywhile his orchard. was loaded with all the varieties of fruit common ! in this climate. "  "There were apples, and peaches, and grapes on the vine,/  And apricots, cherries, and raspberries fine."  J The town h ad been early favored with religious influences. The almost everywhere-present Metho-  dist preacher, full of love and zeal for the Master, i and also the missionaries of the American Home   ! Missionary Society, had found their way to this   i distant field, aand ad broken the bread of life to j the "sheep scattered in the wilderness.' A small,  but active Congregational Church had been formed,   . and the Methodists, and Baptists, now had their respective Churches in different parts of the town, i each laboring, in their own way, for the same great end-the glory of God, and the salvation of souls. During the previous summer, an interesting re- vival had taken place under the labors of the Rev. lr. Truman, the pastor of the   Congregational Church, and many who had hitherto been strangers   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      19  / to the consolations of religion, had yielded to the gentle drawings of the Spirit, and were now re. joicing in Christian hope. As is natural, in such cases, many of the con verts- had united with the Church to -which the minister belonged, who had been the honored instru- ment in their conversion, and among the number were Mr. and 3irs. Atkinsol. They occupied a prominent station in society, as persons of intelli- gence and worth, and now, that they were made partakers of the precious Faith, their virtues shone with additional luster. The duties they had hitherto discharged, from a sense of obligation, .trey now found pleasapt and profitable, under the inspiration of that Faith "that works by love." Since their union to Christ and his Church, they had found a  peculiar pleasure in  "ministering to the saints." Under their hospitable roof, therefore, this wayworn distributor of the Truth felt peculiarly at home.  How could it be  otherwise; for the hearty good-will that speaks in looks and actions, louder than words, assured him that he was weloome. Having a   few letters to write, which he designed to forward by the next mail, he requested to be shown to a  room for that purpose.  While engaged n  writing, Mr. and Mifrs. Atkinson received a visit- ; ng party, who had called to spend the evening in  ocial and religious conversation. So after the  . ./  . *              *  * .    20       THJE JUDD FAMLY. affairs of the household were properly arranged, Mr. Atkinson gavel the Colporteur an invitation to join the party at hs earliest convenience, to which he consented. Accordingly, after finishing his writ- ing, he was introduced to the company as Mr. Nix- on, a Colporteur of the American Tract Society. The company consisted of Rev. Mr. Bennett, the pastor of the Baptist Church, Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot, of the Same denomination, Mr. and Mrs. Alvord, who were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and Mr. and Mrs. Judd, who had not, at that time, united with any Church, although they had professed religion curing the revival, previously referred to; and at the time of this visit their minds were still unsettled, as to which branch of the Church they should finally select as a home. This unsettled state of mind was occasioned by their views as to the mode of Baptism, as practiced by the different denominations. They were of the opin- ion that immersion was the apostolic mode, but they were utterly opposed to what is commonly called "'CLOSE COMMUNION," and this seemed to be the chief obstacle to their uniting with the Baptist Church.

It 'Will be proper, however, to remalk that he was a fine classical and biblical scholar, and was, of course, familiar with the Greek and Latin languages.

Wil- mot looked frequently at Mr. J udd , and his counn tenance evineed  a  desire  to say something that m   ight be applicable to his case. At length , as a f atoable opportunity presented, h e remarked that   22       THE JUDD FAMTLY& he "thought it highly important for those who de- sire to get along successfully in the Christian life, to unite with the Church." The remark was a ju- dicious one, and embodied an important practical truth, that every young convert to Christ should ponder well. Mr. Judd replied that he supposed the remark was intended for himself and Mrs. Judd, and he acknowledged that he felt its force, for he had al- ready realized the need of such a connection. He could not, therefore, assent to the sentiment that a Christian could live as well out of the Church as in it. The'only reason for delay in their case was, that hitherto they hWd been unable to settle their minds as to a choice between the Churches.

I view the sev- i eral denominations as ono great brotherhood. In i Whatever is vital and essential, there is but one j sentiment among them.

He continued, "Though upon minor points there are differences of opinion among them, yet there is one common ground on which they all may and i  should unite, as it belongs equally to them all, where the common brotherhood can be duly and mutually   SCRIPTURA L BAPTISM      2 tsknoRledged--the scr  a a   Lcknvdged-the sacradmental table of our am. mon Lord. .

You say you hold to close Baptism and not to close com- munion, but what is the difference, since it amounts to the same thing in the end. Will you do me the favor, Brother Bennett, to explain this matter if you can?" - We believe," said Mr. Benuett, "that Baptism is a prerequisite to communion, and as we think Baptism can be administered only by immersion, we look upon all other nlodes as null and void. These Hvews constrain us to treat the members of other denominations as unbaptized, and reject them from the communion. Here, then, is the connection between Baptism and communion, and this is what we call close Baptism."      I By this time, the attention of the' whole party was called to the discussion between Mr. Judd and Mr. Bennett. The explanatory remarks of Mr. Ben- nett, set forth his views in so clear a light, that, with his opinion of Baptism, Mr. Judd could make no objection. But, though silenced, be was not sat- isfied. He thought there must be a flaw somewhere. If not, his scruples should be at an end. The reader will perceive that the ground taken by Mr. Bennett, though but the expression of an opinion, and standing alone, of no great importance, yet, in its bearings upon Christian charity and unity, involves questions of great importance.       R   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      25 While the conversation was going on, the Col- J  porteur had been a silent, but not an uninterested I  listener. It was a subject upon which he had be- j  stowed much attention; and the remarks of Mr. i  Bennett had awakened a train of thought that , stirred, to its depths, the fountain of Christian char- ity, for he was a man whose Christian love could not be confined by sectarian barriers. He felt that, though a stranger to t'he company, the views ex- pressed by Mr. Bennett were such, in their bear- ings upon Christian unity, that they forbade his l keeping the silence, that, under other circumstances, he would have felt it his duty to maintain. 'He be- gan, therefore, by remarking, that, though a stran- ger to the company, if Mr. Bennett would not think him intruding, he would be glad to propose a ques. tion or two, especially as the views just expressed by him, involved points that, in their bearings upon other Churches, were of great importance. Mr. Bennett replied that, so far from feeling it an intrusion, he would cheerfully answer any in- quiries he should propose, as far as he was able, and would-be glad to hear any suggestions he might think proper to make. "The question I  wish to propose," said the Col- porteur, "is this: Is Baptism that rite by which we are nade members of the visible Church?" Mr. Bennett replied that he so regarded it. ir   26       T Hi JUDD FAMLY. "Then you hold that no one can be a member of the visible Church without Baptism?" 'iost certainly," said Mr. Bennett. "You believe the Lord's Supper, as an institut tion of the Christian Church, is designed only for its members?" Mr. Bennett replied, "Such are the views we en- :tertain as a Church." "Then, if I conceive rightly," said the Co0por- teur, "yolu do not commune with other professedly Christian Churches, because, in your view, they have not a valid ministry, nor a legal membership, neither the one, or the other, having been Baptized; or, in other words, because thoey are not real or legal Churches of Christ." This conclusion, drawn from Mr. Bennett's own acknowledgement, was so plain that he could not deny it. Looking somewhat confused, he confessed that such was the case. He saw, too, the unchari- i table position it placed him, and his Church in, but then it was his wish to excuse himself and Church, i in this particular, /so he added:         "We do not wish to assume that we are the only Christians in the world. We recognize the many excellent things in other professedly Christian Churches, but we assert that however many excel- lent qualities may be found in individuals, or asso- ciate bodies, -unless they have been regularly ini- 4e   tI        SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM. I  tiated by Baptisum, they are not legal Churohes of Christ. -You will confess," he added, "that unless a man is a legal member of the Church, he cannot become a minister, with the rightful authority to administer its ordinances. Authority may be as- sumed, but the validity of his ministrations may well be questioned." "You argue justly from your premises," rejoined the Colporteur. "Admitting the premises that you I have assumed to be correct, every organization of 1 Christians, not practicing immersion, is inevitably unchurched.  But, sir, where consequences of such I magnitude are the results of a doctrine, the dbctrine itself should be supported by the most positive and unequivocal testimony." "We think, sir," said Mr. Bennett, " that the tes- timony, by which our views on this subject are sup- ported, is of the most positive and indisputable char- acter, and such as should convince every person." "And yet, you are aware, that threesfourths of the Christian world are not convinced by this very tes- timony, which you think so clear and positive." "I'm inclined to think the main reason is, they do not wish to be convinced," said Mr. Bennett. "And they, in turn, might say the same  of you, and with equal justice," rejoined the Colporteur. "And so, by mutual accusations of being warped by prepossession and sectarian interest, either party /   A 28      THE JUDD FAMLY. would become more and more estranged from each other in feeling; but how far the cause of real Chris: tianity would be promoted thereby, it is easy to toe. No! No! Brother Bennett, such accusations iwill never bring the Christian world together. Nothing, in my view, could be more desirable, than a uniform- ity of faith among all Christians upon the points really essential to unity and fellowship; but if it is ever attained, it must be by that charity which think- eth no evil,' As the Colporteur closed the last sentence, Mr. Atkinsone addressed him in language something like the following;         "Mr. Nixon, from your manner of address, and your familiarity with the subject, I take you to be a minister of the Gospel. Am I right in my con- jecture?" "You are," he answered, " and I confess myself to be one of those who worship God after the man- ner Brother Bennett calls heresy. And since God receives me, and communicates his love to me, the sentence of excommunication does not disturb my peace, although I deeply regret the spirit of exclusive- ness which sets the Household of Faith at variance with itself. It is not right. It cannot be. There should be mutual love, and fellowship, among all I the disciples of Christ." At these words of the Colporteur, Mr. Bennett   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      29 was somewhat touched. He thought they reflected on him as wanting charity for other Christians. Hap. pily for him, his Christian feelings were not in har- mony with his creed; and I am happy in believing, that such is the case with a large majority of his faith and order, as will appear from their efforts to reconcile their feelings to their practice. Starting up, he said: "Mr. Nixon, you do us injustice if you suppose us wanting in charity toward other Christians. We make a difference between Christian fellowship and Church fellowship., The first we extend to all Chris- tians, the latter we restrict to our own members." "I am happy in this plain avowal of your. feel- ings," said the Colporteur. "Perhaps I am. dull of comprehension; but really, I cannot discover any essential difference between Church- fellowship and Christian fellowship. There is a verbal difference, I admit, but they amount to the same thing. What is Church fellowship but Christian fellowship? It really appears to me that where we have the latter, there can be no bar to the former. Come Bro. Bennett, be honest! Don't you sometimes fear that in this matter, you make a distinction without a differene?ei "Do you question my honesty?" said Mri Ben- nett, somewhat excited. "Pardon me, my dear sir, I meant no such thing. :, It was only the slip of the tongue. You know," It,  wa onyth            ,   30       THE JUDD FAIrLY. 7' he continued," that this is a practical age. Every- thing is brought to the test of- experiment. We judge of the merits of a thing by its utility. Many things that look well in theory, are not so in prac- tice."  "Very true," said Mr. Bennett. "Well," said the Colporteur, " for what purpose was the visible Church organized?" "I suppose there are several ends of good to be attained by the organization of the Church," said Mr. Bennett, "all based upon the general idea that 'in union there is strength.' The first -is for the- benefit of the individual members composing it. In some sense the strength of all is the strength of each. It imposes restraints. It confers privileges-- giving access to the ordinances and institutions of Christianity-all good, for practical purposes, to maintain the spirit of vital religion in the heart, and its outward fruits in the life." "Excellent! Excellent!!" said the Colporteur. "What more P?" "A second design, if I apprehend it rightly, is, that the Church, by its concentrated light and in- fluence, is to be the instrument in, propagating the Christian Faith, and the channel through which the Salvation of the Gospel is to flow to the nations of the earth."    . "B6autiful! Beautiful!!" ejaculated Mr. Nixon.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.       31 "And is not the Church to be, in the lives of its members, a standing representation of all the moral and spiritual beauty'of the Lord?" "Very true," responded Mr. Bennett. '"Well," said the Colporteur, "I rejoice to find such harmony of sentiment between us. But," con- tinued he, " let us make an application of these facts to the case in hand. Do not other Churches answer the same ends of Church organization, as effectu- ally as do Baptist Churches? Are they not to their members, as to spiritual helps, all that Baptist Churches are to those who belong to them? Do not tha members of Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational Churches, and others, exhibit as much of the spirit of piety, and of a practical, ac- tive, working Christianity, as do the members of Baptist Churches, or, are they a whit behind the Baptists in all that constitutes the noblest type of Christian character? Do the members of Baptist Churches manifest any deeper concern for the un- converted at home, or, are they any more self- denying, or liberal, in maintaining missions among the heathen? And, finally, are their labors more sig- nally blessed in the conversion of souls to Christ?" Mr. Bennett made no reply. How could he? un- less it were to concede the whple argument to Mr. Nixon, for lie knew that statistics were against him. The company, too, saw the force of these facts, Zk-   *32      THE JUDD' FAMLY. in their bearing upon the question at issue. They knew that Baptist Churches could claim no preatm- inence in these respects, and hence the claim that  they, alone; were true Churches of Christ, gave them  an hostile, as well as a Pharisaic appearance, in the eyes of the Christian world.,'          ! Probably the conversation would not have taken ' 1 the turn it did, had the company known in the out- i set that Mr. Nixon was a minister of the Gospel. , Matters had now proceeded too far, however, to be , abruptly broken off. Mr. Bennbtt, in attempting to justify his Church in its practice of restricted corn- munion, had taken the ground that Baptist (Churches  were, alone, the true or valid Churches of Christ;  and it was due to the company that he should sup- port that claim by good and indisputable testimony,  if he had any.                  i Mr. Judd, as he was most interested, proposed  that, as the subject had been introduced, and espe-  cially, as they were now favgled with the company of two persons, who, from their position as minis-  ters, better understood the subject, the arguments, I pro and con, should be presented. "It is," he said,  "my earnest wish to know the truth, and my de- vout prayer for docility of spirit, to embrace it." To this proposition of Mr. Judd, the most of the company gave their warm assent. Mr. Bennett replied that when the subject was   introduced, he did not contemplate an issue like this, He felt a reluctance to doctrinal discussions, espe- cially on such an occasion as this, for such discus- sions were apt to excite unkind, if not angry feelings. The Colporteur sanctioned these remarks of Mr. Bennett, but added, "While it is true that doctrin- al discussions do, sometimes, excite unkind feelings, it only shows a stronger attachment to sectarian dogmas, than love of the truth, and desire to know it. So far as my own feelings are concerned," he added, " it would be more agreeable to me to con- verse on other topics. But as the subject is one upon which my own mind was once troubled, and one upon which I have bestowed some attention, if it will be of service to any of the company, I have no objection to a friendly discussion of it." Although Mr. Bennett felt no disposition to ap- proach the subject under such circumstances, it was now too late to make an- honorable retreat. He, therefore, resolved to approach it manfully, and do the best he could. "The question, as I understand it," said Mr. Bennett, "is this, What was the practice of Christ and his Apostles as to the mode and subjects of Baptism?"   "I do not so understand it," said the Colpor- teurn." "Your proposition covers the ground only in part. The question, as I view it, is this, Did The Judd Family.    3   34       THE JUDD FAMIY.         ? Christ and his Apostles not only practice immersion, but did they teach that it was the only valid and allowable mode; and did they administer it to none except upon profession of faith?"  - "(But what is the difference between the two pro- i positions," said Mr. Wilmot. "The difference is this," said "the Colporteur, "that, could you prove the Apostolic practice to have i been immersion, you would only prove a fact, and not a doctrine. They might have chosen that, from ii a variety of modes, as under the circumstances'pref- i erable, but not as vital and essential. This fact proved, would not, therefore, disprove other modes. This covers the ground of Brother Bennett's proposi-  tion. Bit, if they not only practiced immersion ex- - clusively, but also taught that no other mode was right, then the ground of the second proposition is - covered. Now," continued the Colporteur, "' the question really at issue is this: Is the mode an essential part  of the rite, or, is 'it only a circumstance attending  it?" "I do not know as I apprehend your meaning," said Mr. Judd.                   "Perhaps I could better explain my meaning by ! raising the inquiry: Is any particular posture of the , body essential to prayer? Is standing, kneeling, or prostration, any part of prayer?"   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     i 35 "O! I understand you," said Mr. Judd. "Prayer does not depend upon any posture of the body, but upon things entirely independent .of it." ' But, should I prove that in certain instanoes the Apostles knelt when they prayed, would it prove e that they always knelt when they prayed? It would, indeed, prove that kneeling Was' an Apostolic prao- tice, but would it prove that kneeling was essential to prayer?"           ' "Most certainly not," said Mr. Judd. "Well, but suppose Brother Bennett can prove tLat immersion was an Apostolic practice,--which, by the way, I hardly think he can,-would that prove that they always and in every case practiced immersion?"'                 I "I think not,' said Mr. Judd. "The difference between Mr. Bennett's position and mine is this: I hold the mode to be simply and purely incidental. He claims it as an ssential part of the rite. To sustain his position, he must prove that the mode is essential, and not insdental, and also that immersion is the essential mode. Now if he fails in the first, he fails in the second." ' I :see it, I see it," said Mr. Judd. "If, now, Brother Bennett sustains his position," continued the Colporteur, " all who do not practice immersion exclusively, are not Baptized, and cannot be members of the Church. I claim to have been   36       THE JUDD FAMLY.           Baptized, but not by immersion. Although I en-   i tered upon that act solemnly and conscientiously, and felt at the time that I was entering into coyv- : enant with God, and enjoyed a sweet sense of his- approbation in so doing; yet, if Mr. Bennett's posi- i tion is correct, it was all a sham, and good for  ' nothing, and I am not a member of the visible    i Church. My ordination to the Gospel ministry, though in good faith by my brother ministers, and! ratified by the Church to which I belong, was all a solemn farce; my ministrations are all invalid,  P and my title to a place in the Church and ministry i an unwarrantable assumption! This may seem- a light matter to him, but it affects me seriously. Nor ? does the matter stop here. His position, if true,  I unchurches three-fourths of the professedly Christian !

Such a claim should be supported by the most   clear and positive testimony-,no mere inferences-  no jumping at conclusions, can be allowed here. Nothing but clear and positive testimony." These remarks of the Colporteur presented the subject in an entirely new light to the company. Even Mr. Bennett, himself, seemed startled with this picture of the practical results of his position ; and, hence, his task of attempting to prove it was not O) his ask of   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      $T an over-pleasant one. But, as the distinctive policy of his Church was based upon it, he must either attempt to prove it, or disown and abandon it. He was not prepared to do this, and of course was driven to attempt its proof. How well he suc- ceeded, will be seen in the next chapter. l   88       TH JUDBD FA-MTD t         si i.

Such was the case with Mr. Bennett. His convictions, whether well or ill-founded, from long standing, were deep, and in their nature,- abiding. For years he had cherished the opinion  that immersion was the only valid mode of Bap- tism. His reading, as well as his religious associa-  tions, had been of a character to cherish and con- firm that opinion.           i Taking his Bible, he turned to the third chap- ter of Matthew, and read from the 13th to the 17th verses inclusive, "Then cometh Jesus from' Galilee to Jordan, unto John, to be baptized of him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway ut- of the water."   SCRTPTURBAL BAPTISM.     39 f "Here,' said he, 'we have the example of Jesus, which We are all bound to follow. And when we compare the first clause of the 16th verse, with the 6th, 'And were baptized of him in Jor- , dan, confessing their sins,' it is, plain that our Saviour was Baptized by immersion. The persons mentioned in the 5th verse, are, in the 6th, said to be Baptized of him in Jordan. And Jesus, when he was Baptized 'went up straightway out of the water'.'t "You will observe," said he, "'John did not Baptize by Jordan, nor- with Jordan, but in Jordan. Now, I conclude, that, as Jesus was Baptized iin Jordan; and, as John Baptized, not only ini Jordan, but in '.Enon near to , Salem, because there was much water there,' his only reason for selecting such a place, was, that he might immerse those who came to him for Baptism." He continued: "Not only does the Savior give the authority of his example to immersion, but the Apostolic practice shows that they so understood the will of their Master. In Acts vtr,' from the 36th to the 39th verse, we have an account of the Bap- tism of the Ethiopian eunuch by Philip. Here we are told, thatt 'they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.' The sense of this, and the other texts, just quoted -as proof, is fixed by the Apostle Paul, in Romans vi--4, 5.   40       THE, JUDD FPAfTl.' 'Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death.' And also by the same Apostle in Colos- sians II,-12. 'Buried with him in baptism.' The one referring to the act of Baptism, and the other to the state ot the Baptized. It is plain that sprinkling cannot answer this figure, and nothing :short of immersion is intended by it."' In this hasty review of the leading texts of  t Scripture, usually quoted in support of immersion, I Mr. Bennett seemed to gather confidence in the strength of his position, and he looked around on the company to see the effect of his argument upon their minds. He had evidently made some im- presion, especially upon Mr. and Mrs. Judd. All eyes were now turned to the Colporteur. After a moment, he -answered: "Brother Bennett, admitting your interpretation of those texts of Scripture to be correct, do you think it proves your position?" "'Most certainly,"' said he. "Then I am compelled to take issue with you. Your position is, that immersion is the only valid mode, and consequently that that mode is essential to the rite. Granting all you --laim,--that immer- sion was the mode practiced in these several cases, --does that invalidate other modes '? You have only proved a fact, in that case, and not a doctrine. You need to go a step further, and prove that that   SCRIPT'URAL BAPTISM.'     41 practice was in obedience to an express Divine com- mand, and not a mere matter of choice, on the ground of convenience, on the part of the Apostles. Will vou please to do this, Brother Bennett? Where, in all this blessed Bible, do you, or can you, find a 'Thus saith the Lord,' -nothing but immersion is Baptism?" This was putting the subject into a shape that Mr. Bennett was not prepared to meet; consequently he remained silent, and so the Colporteur continued: "And then, too, your conclusions are only infer- ences. Those textsdo not say that any one was im- mersed. Every fact stated in those passages might be true, and yet no immersion in the case. You only guess, or infer, that the mode was immersion. Let me assure you that these very paages are guscep- tible of other inferences, equally good, as I will pres- ently show you. You lay much stress upon the prep- osition ial. You say, John Baptized in Jordan, not by Jordan, nor with Jordan.' Does not John say, Matth. III,--1, 'I indeed baptize you with w ter'? With what water? With the water of Jordan, of course. You must be aware that the Greek prep- ositions ey, Ae6, and ars, like the English prepositions in, by, and at, have a great latitude of meaning.

Thus, Where did John Baptize? Answer, In Jordan, in Enon, in Betliabara  How, or in what manner, did he Baptize? Answer,' With water.' How does Christ Baptize? ' With the IIoly Ghost.' So we say of a neighbor or friend, w'e saw  them in or at Ann Arbor, or down by the river. So much on that poiut.  "Again: You are quite sure that Christ's Bap- tism was an example for us to follow. I am quite as sure that his Baptism was no more an example for us, in the sense you use it, than was his cru- cifixion. His Baptism was in obedience to the de- mands of the Levitical law, which required those entering the Priesthood at the age of thirty years, to-be Baptized. 'And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash (i. e., Baptize) them with water.' Exod. xxTx, 4. With this there was also the anointing with, the holy oil. "When Jesus said, 'For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness,' he plainly refers to this spe- cific law, for- the consecration of a priest; and you know, my friends, that Christ was a priest after the order of Melchisedec-that is, a priest out of the line of Aaron; and as performing a priestly work, he was here inducted into the priestly office." "But is not Christ an example for us to fol- low," said Mr. Wilmot.   SCRIPTURAL. BAPTISM.      43 "Most truly so," said the Colporteur. He is the model of a complete and perfect manhood: an exemplar in all the graces that elevate and adorn, purify and beautify, human character. In the sense of rendering full obedience to law,-all law,-he was our exemplar, but no farther. His Baptism and cru- cifixion both illustrate and uphold law." Here the Colporteur paused. A deep silence pervaded all minds for a minute, and all counte- nances bore the impress of deep thought. They evi- dently felt the force of the facts presented by the Colporteur, and the mental process of comparing facts, and of drawing conclusions, was going on. Mr. Bennett felt very uneasy just then. Some- thing must be done; so, he broke the silence, "Mr. Nixon," said he, "you have, as yet, touched only one point in my argument. Although nothing can be drawn from the prepositions, yet there are other facts in this connection that seem to me to have weight. It is said that 'John was baptizing in -Enon near to Salem, because there was {much water there.' Had his Baptism been a sprinkling, it might have been performed elsewhere, as well as where there was much water. I think this fact of some weight, in determining this. question." "Here, again, you have only an inference," saia the Colporteur. "Are you not aware that the Greek word wRoAa, which- is here rendered much ,- is more   "      . THE JUDD FAMLY. frequently rendered many ; and that this is the na- tural signification of the word?" "I suppose that Anon remains the same to-day that it was in our Lord's time," said Mr. Alvord, who had been watching the progress of the argu- ment with deep interest. "Do not travellers, who have of late years visited the spot, say something on this point?"           .  "They do," said the Colporteur. "They tell us  that ' /Enon is a place abounding in springs of wa- ter,'- and is therefore literally a place of many waters. And they tell us, also, that there are no springs large enougln for purposes of immersion."    iE "Then John could rot have Baptized by immer- [ sion at that place," responded Mr. Alvord, with a H quizzical look at Mr. Bennett.          s "To my mind, there are other and more obvious ? reasons for John's seeking such places," said the  Colporteur. "Why, I never supposed there could be any - other reason, but to immerse or Baptize those who I came to him!" said Mr. Judd, with great sim-   s plicity. *.  The Colporteur smiled, and then proceeded.    "You know that, in our own country, our Meth- "' odist brethren, when they propose to hold a Camp- meeting, for only a few days, are always careful to select a place where there is much watery although,   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      405 as everybody knows, it; is not for purposes of im- mersion." Mr. Alvord's eyes snapped while he rejoined, "That's so." Mr. Nixon continued: "Now, when we consider that great multitudes attended John's preaching, and that his ministry was confined to the wilderness of Judea, which was a desert, only as the Jordan ran through it, it must be evident to you all, I think, that in a hot climate like that, even if John had not Baptized at all, much water would be needed by those great mul- titudes, for themselves and their beasts ; and,.on that account, John would have confined his ministry to the banks of the Jordan." Mr. Judd gave two emphatic nods of his head, as indicative of the force this argument of Mr. Nix- on's had upon his mind. "This argument is further strengthened by con- sidering the fact, that our ' Lord made and baptized more disciples than John :' and yet, no mention is made of their going to, or returning from, any place of water. The reason for this will be found in the fact, that our Lord's ministry was confined to the e cities and villages, where all had a supply of water for themselves, close by. If Jesus had Dracticed im- mersion, as Mr. Bennett supposes, that fact would be likely to have come out in the narrative. This   40       THE JUDD FPAMtY.    . opinion is strengthened and corroborated by the events of the day of Pentecost, when, under Peter's preaching, three thousand were converted, and add. ed to the Church, as no mention is made of their  leaving the place for purposes of Baptism, which  would have been the case if that multitude had been  immersed. The change of garments,-the parade,  -with the moving of the crowd, and the excitement , incident to such an occasion, as we see on similar ! occasions in our day, where only a few are to be immersed,-all of which could not have occurred  without its coming out in the narrative of so great  an event, if such had really been the case." These were facts that Mr. Judd, and indeed most  of the company, had never before considered; and it was evident that two quite different inferences could be drawn from the sam'e circulnstances and facts; and to most of the company, the inferences of the Colporteur appeared much the most reason- i able.                      I "Now," continued he, '"as Mr. Bennett's claim s for immersion unchurches three-fourths of the Chris- tian world, I ask, if so much of the evidence as I have reviewed will warrant such grave conclusions, does it even prove that any, in Apostolic times, were immersed?' The reader will see that unless stronger evidence! than this could be brought, Mr. Bennett would fail   BCBIPT'URGAL BAPTISMS      47 to prove any single instance of immersion fi om the. New Testament. There were two passages of Scripture which Mr, Bennett thought full and clear for immersion, to which Mr. Nixon had not made reply. So he called his attention to them: "That the Apostolic mode, after all, was immer- sion, I think evident from St. Paul's statement, 'Buried with him by baptism,' and ' Buried with him, in baptism,' which necessarily, I think, implies immersion. And as the same Apostle tells us, Eph. Iv, 5, 'One Lord, one faith, one baptism.' So now, if there is but one Baptism, as the Apostle declares, -and I presume you will take him for testimony,-- and further, if that one Baptism is by immersion, or, rather, is immersion, then, of course, sprinkling and pouring are not Baptism." "Is it not possible," said Mr. Nixon, " that you have misapprehended the meaning of the Apostle in these passages?" "'As I do not claim infallibility," said Mr. Ben- nett, ",I admit that it is possible, but, I think, not probable." "You are sure, then, Brother Bennett, that those texts are conclusive for immersion? By what rule of interpretation do you arrive at that conclusion?" "By the rule of common sense," said Mr. Bennnett. "Very well," said Mr., Nixon, -"as I am  hot   48      ^ THE JUDD FAMLY.           gifted with any ptocommon sense, I will apply your rule in my review of them: And, first: Common sense would suggest that, in the interpretation of any text, we should look at its connection with the leading topic of discourse. In this case, what was the leading topic of discourse? Baptism? or moral purity?-death to sin."  " Mr. Atkinson, who sat near the center-table, took up the large family Bible, and turned to the pas- sage in Rom. vi, and, at the request of Mr. Nixon, read the first five verses: "What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid! How 'shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." "Evidently, the main fact the Apostle is here laboring to establish, is freedom from sin," said Mr. Bennett. "Now," 'said the Colporteur, "the answer to two simple questions, will determine the Apostle's meaning.  1 st. Into what were they buried? And 2d. By what agent or instrument was the burial accomplished? '   avm^-rruCKAL BAPTISM.      49 s Why, Paul says it is into death," said Mr. Judd, "Just so, and therefore it was not into water,' said Mr. Alvord.    .      - "And Baptism is the agent, or instrument, by which the burial is accomplished," said the Colpor- teur. "To say that the Baptism and the burial are the same, would be to confound the agent with his work. The burial was the simple result of the Bap. tism What' the Apostle means by being burie into death, is, to become dead to sin. The truth is, the whole passage is figurative, instead of literal. The Baptism spoken of in the text, is that which is shadowed forth by water Baptism-the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. And Christ, himself, is the Baptizer, according to the declaration of John: ' He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire". " "I don't know about that," said Mr. Bennett. 'I've always thought Baptism was a figure of the burial, and resurrection of Christ.'" "That, in my view, is a mere inference; unsup. ported by even a shadow of testimony," said Mr. Nixon. "But for the sake of the argument, sup. pose the Apostle is here speaking of water Baptism. Then water Baptism is a saving ordinance, and, if a saving ordinance, then God has two ways of say- ing men--one ,ith Baptism, and the other wit/Wu it. Otherwise, four-fifths of the Christian, and all The Judd r amil y.. 4   50  aTHE JUDD FAMMTY. S of the heathen world are lost without hope. And then again, if a mere external rite has such efficacy, the Romish dogma of transubstantiation may be true .after all. Now what is not true, of water Bap- tism, is emphatically true of the Spiritual Baptism. This is, indeed, the real, the all-availing Baptism, and those who receive it, are Baptized into Christ, and become dead to sin, through the inflowing life received by and through Faith." He continued: "In this passage the Apostle introduces three figures to illustrate his subject. First, a burial; iSecond, a planting; Third, a crucifixion. All beau- tifully expressive of death to sin, and the resurrec- tion of the soul to the new, the spiritual life. And we are no more literally buried with him than we are literally crucified with' him. "It is, therefore, evident that in this passage there is no allusion whatever to water Baptism. But admitting there is, it is only to Baptism as an agent in producing an effect, and not the most distant allusion to the mode or manner of its working." Mr. Nixon continued: "The same remarks will apply to the passage in Col. Ii, 12' 'Buried with him in baptism, wherein ye are also risen with him, through the faith of the operatio of God.' In the 1Ith verse, the Apostle speaks of the ciroumcision 'made without hands,' which he calls, 'the oircum- cision of'Christ,' by which he evidnitly means   Spiritual circumcision; or the circumcision of the heart, by the influence and power of the Holy Spirit."  "Now, this Spiritual circumcision is identical with Spiritual Baptism, because its work and effeots are thesame. According to this language, Baptism i Spiritual circumcision. In our Baptism (if we have received the true Spiritual Baptism), we are ' buried with him,'from the allurements of the world;, sinful affections, and selfish motives; and are risen with him to a new a new and holy life, through th aith in God's method of working, which purifies the hfearti": - The Colporteur then turned and addressing Mri Bennett, said: My dear sir,; water Baptism is powerless t produce effects like these; and it is not, therefore, referred to in ese pasages; and, onsequentl  r  they give no support to your doctrine of immersion' And then  , too," he continued, "the Baptism of the Spirit. is never spoken of as an immersion; but always as -a pouring out, and tfaling upon. "Immersion7 or its equivalent, overwhem is, in- deed, use&d in the.:Scriptures as as fifgure or emblem; abut, 'aloayys as the symbol of distre. and anguish, hat which  is jgoyons and., life-giing, ailways: come s by  a pouing' out, or falling uponn." The whole company. had given the losest at.-   52       THE JUDD FATLY,.. tention to these explanations of the Colporteur. He had evidently carried the war into the enemy's camp, and wrested from  him the, most of his strong-holds.  Mr. Bennett was now in a sad dilemma.   If these- texts referred to water Baptism, then it was a saving ordinance, which he was not willing to admit. And if they referred to the Spiritual Bap. tism, they gave no support to the doctrine of ima mersion. And whether they referred to water, or Spiritual Baptism, it was evident, the mode was not even hinted at. There was, however, one point that had not yet been -brought into debate. This was the rock of his refuge, and Mr. Bennett fled to it. It was the meaning of - the word ' Baptizo.' He therefore replied : "Even if there were no clear examples of im- mersion in the New  Testament, and no evident, allusion to it, in the writings of the ApoStles, the meaning/of the word Baptizo, I think, would for- ever settle the question it favor of immersion."' He continued: "I believe it is conceded by the most learned of the Pedo-Baptist writers, that the, Greek word I Baptizo means only to immerse; and hence, we learn from the history of the early Church, thatt immersion was universally practiced."     B * '    SORIPTURAL BAPTISM.       3 "Not universally, Mr. Bennett; that is a little too strong for fact. That a partial dipping, an in some cases, a total immersion was practieed, as early as the second century, no on e a cquainted with the early history of the  Church will deny," said Mr. Nixon.  "But, that it was universally practiced is not true. While immersion was frequently prac- ticed, in the third century, on the plea that it was more expressive; it was also administered by por- ing, to the sick and infirm. Of this fact there is abundant proof in Church history; and it hows that the modern doctrine of a few persons, that ini- mersion is the only vlid mode, had no existence in the Church. "And now  , Brother Bennett," he continued, " as  ;o the meaning of the word Baptizo, as used, either 3y the more ancient classic Greek writers; or, by he writers of the New Testament, a fair investiga. ion will show it to be against you.  The question not whether the word does not sometime mean im - ersion; but whether that is its ez  csivemeauing. "I have been pained at what appears to me, a ant of fairness, not to say honesty, in Baptist iters upon the meaning of the word, in m isr epre ting the views of Pedo-Baptist writers, by forcing om to testify against themselves; which , in fact, y never really do.

"True," said the Colporteur, "but does- he- say that such is its' onj meianing? or can you find among the hosts of Pedo;Bptist writers, one, even OE, Mr'. Bennett, that gives this as its only mean ing? Not one, and here is the unfairness." "Well, well!" said. Mr. Bennett, somewhat, ex. dited, as he SaWt hisl last plank sliding from under hikm, " do they not all admit at its primitive mean- ing is to Imnerse? Then what authority have we to attach any other meaning to it?"  "Ifthe Greeks;, themselvei gave the word a varietty of mesnings, surely wo sheold have the s"m privilege," re'poned!e Mr.?0ion; an:hens added "For one, I care very little whether the origiai e'ait g of the word WaS rmn^m8er or not, so long   as it was used to express other forms of action. But, sir, your position that immerse was the primary meaning of the word, is seriously questioned by many learned men, who give it as their opinion that the word originally meant, tinge, stai, coor, etc., and that when used to mean immerse, it is in a secondary and accommodated sense, growing out of the fact that things dyed, or colred, were usually dipped or immersed in the coloring flud for that purpose.' Mr. Wilmot gave an ineredulous stare at these statements of Mr. Nixon. It was the first time he had ever heard the interpretations of hs own rain? ister seriously questioned. Mr. Nixon oontinued: "Since the word Baptizo is only derived from the word Bapto, it may be less definite, and threfore have a greater latitude of meaining, an4 yet Mr. Md wards says of BaptO ' that it is a word of swh atX. itude of eaning, that he who sha  artempt to prove, from its use in various authors, an -absolute and total immersion, will ' d that he has unr.- taken that which he ean never firly perform.'. . "Mr. EdBwards then produees several ie nples, whiere the idea 4 f imnrersion s pextlde, thri e f which are from elassie Oreelk uthors of andbubte authority, and I will quote their 'wrds for theI speeial benefit of Brother Bewaet4t," said Mi 'ron, with a smile.    56       THE JUDD FAMNY. e "Homer says of a certain battle he was describ- ing, viz.: the battle of the Frogs and Mice on the border of the lake: ' E Bapteto de aimati limne,' -The lake was Baptized with blood.  That is, it was stained, or colored with blood. Aristophanes, speaking of Magnese, the comedian, who used to color his face, instead of wearing a mask, says: Baptomenos,'-he Baptized it. And Aristotle says, of a certain substance: ' Thbomenros Baptei Hien cheira,'- being pressed, it Baptizes the hand. Here, then, we have three instances, in which Bapto, in some of its forms, is used, none of which can mean immersion; but, each of which can be translated to mean nothing less than to stain, to color, to dye." He, continued: "But, in the language of Professor Woods, 'There are many reasons for supposing that Baptizo, being a derivative of Bapto, has a less definite, and less forcible meaning; and yet, even Bapto does not always signify immersion."' "I do not like the authors you quote," said Mr Bennett., "They are too much like Milner, in his Church History. Benedict in his History of the Baptists, traces our Church back in regular succes  sion through the Waldenses to John the Baptist. But Milner says the Waldenses believed in, and practiced Infant Baptism." "I do not doubt your statement in the least," said the Colporteur. "But their statements are not   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     5S much in your favor. Facts are stubborn things, and hard to dispose of, and, in this case, they are certainly against you." Here the Colporteur paused. Then, after a mo- ment's reflection, he said: "My friends, I fear I shall weary you by this discussion; perhaps it were better for me to drop it at this point." "No! no!" said Mr. Judd, "not if you are wil- ling to proceed. I am too anxious to get light on this subject-all the light you have, Mr. Nixon." Mr. Judd's request, being seconded by the most of the company, and objected to by  none, he re- sumed the discussion, "It has seemed to me, my friends, that our Bap- tist brethren have laid quite too much stress on the meaning of the word Baptgzo, I  honor their zeal for what they honestly esteem the truth, and how- ever I  am compelled to differ from them, still I love them as brethren and as co-laborers in the Mas. ter's work. . "There are considerations, that, to my mind, have great weight in determining the argument as to the meaning of the word. These considerations center in this fact: That the meaning of a word i one age, is no sure indication of its meaning in subsequent one. The forms of human speech are the while undergoing changes. And  this is the   58       THE JUJDD VAWMr Y         result of the progress of the human mind in general  knowledge. As new facts and new truths are made known, new words must be coined, or old words, somewhat analogous, must be taken to express them. In the latter case, which is the most common, the word receives a new, and accommodated meaning, while the old meaning still attaches to it. In con  formity with this rule, it will be found that in all  the languages of the civilized world, most words have an original, and accommodated meaning. Such is the case with the English language. Thus with the words cday, board, prevent, etc. The word day originally signifying that portion 'of the twenty-four hours in which it is light. Then by accommodation signifying the period of the earth's rotation upon its axis; and finally, any completed period of time, as ' O that thou hadst known even in this thy day'-- and "Every dog must have his day,' Thus, too, with the word board. Its primary meaning is a piece of wood, having length, breadth, and limited thickness. As such boards are used to spread the daily meal upon, and also to transact business upon, two other meanings have grown out of it. An offi- oial, or corporate body is called a Board. And it has come to mean, as a verb, the act of taking one's meals, in a given place. In like manner, al water craft are made out of boards, we speak off bshpoara, and of going on board, etc. The word * ogg. Jm  f-oig   ba   SGCIPTUTAL 'BATISM.       59 * prevent, when first incorporated into our language, had it Latin signification, of going before, to aid. Now it has come to mean the effect of going before, to .hinder. "Such too, was the case with, the word Baptizo. With the early Greeks, it meant the radical change in substances produced by dying or coloring. Then it caume to mean the process by which substances are dyed, of dipping or immersing them in the col-i oring fluid. As the early Greeks were pagans, we do not learn that they used the word to express any religious idea. But when, in a subsequent age, the Jews were brought under the civil power of the Greeks, and their language became general, under the successors of Alexander, among the Jews, many words. received such modifications of mean- ing as fitted them to express :the ideas of revealed religion. Such was evidently the case with Baptizo Among them it was taken to express the idea of purity, moral and ceremonial, as set forth in their various rites of purification. The 'divers Baptisms,' spoken of in Heb. Ix, 10, no doubt refer to those rites of purification, the grand leading thought be- ing, in my opinion, the radical change wrought in the character by that Divine purifying symbolized in those,:purifications, or cleansings." "Now, in the light of these facts," said he, ,is it -not evident, that; the-real question is not, :what IXF *is -n  Ha   60       THE JUDD FAMTtlY.  was the meaning of the word among the pagan  Greeks, but rather, what our Savior meant to teach by its use? If it can be shown that they used it in a way to exclude the idea of immersion, then  your argument is lost. Are you willing to bring the X matter to this test, Brother Bennett?"  "I don't know," said he.  "I have always   thought we were bound to adhere to the original  meaning of the word, as the safe, and, to me, the only sure way of doing the will of the Master." "I really honor your desire to mAt the Master's  wishes, in this respect," said r. nixon, "but  granting that, will it help you any? Don't you see  that to apply, the original meaning of the word, in  Baptism, would be preposterous?"  "I do not," said Mr. Bennett.  "Let us use the word as conveying its original  meaning," was the answer, "and see how it looks applied to this rite. Thus, I tinge, stain, or color you, in the name of the Flather, and of the Son, 0 and of the Holy Ghost, as this was the original  meaning of the word.'? The company burst into a laugh at the ludicrous- ness of the thought.             , "No! no! that would not do," said Mr Bennett. "That would not agree with my definition of the word." "But if you take the word in its accommodated   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.       1 sense-immersion," replied Mr. Nixon, "then you depart from your own rule, and admit that the original definition of the word is not the one you adhere to, but another growing out of it" "But I have not admitted that to dye, to stain, to color, is the original meaning of the word," said Mr. Bennett. "Well," said the Colporteur, "you cannot deny that that was one. of its definitions. Its use in the instances I quoted from Homer, Aristophanes, and Aristotle, will demonstrate that." "Well! what fof it?" said Mr. Bennett.  "Why, plainly this: that immersion is not its only meaning; and if it has other meanings, then, some one of them may attach to it, in the case of Baptism." "I don't know but you are getting to the wind- ward of me," said Mr. Bennett, smiling. "I think we shall have to seek the definition of the word in the use our Savior made of it, after all." "Then," said Mr. Nixon, "let us go directly to the Word, and see if there are not instances where the idea of immersion is excluded. Mark tells us,  chap. vI, 4th verse: 'And when they come from    I the market, except they wash ( apofontai), are -Bap . tized, they eat not.

"They could not have been immerse- they were too large for that." "These Baptisms were perrorbed a  religious duties and by aprinkling water of purying- upon them, and so far as individuals are referred to, th I Jewish RabLins tell usj that it .was by hryviFg water  poured upon the arms and hands by another," The Colporteur continued: "This same word is used in reference to the sufferings of Christ when his body was bathed in sweat and blood, and is called the 'Baptism of suf- fering.' Thus, Matth. xx, 23, 'Ye shall drink in- deed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with.7 "Go, my friends, to the garden and the. cross,  and mark the deep agony, and the bloody sweat; and see the Baptism that He wat Baptized wih, but :you find no immersion there.

It is true the subject had been discussed in a brief X manner; but the material argument on either sided had been brought out; and the result was not the most favorable to Mr. Bennett's opinions, in the minds of most of the company. They distinctly  saw a want of evidence to support his assertions; and his claim, therefore, that the Baptists were the  only valid Churches of Christ, was its own refuta. tion.  To an enlightened Christian mind, it is too preposterous to be entertained for a moment. This discussion, as it will hereafter appear, was not without its results. It opened, to the most of the company, a new class of facts, and gave rise to new trains of thought. The question too often overlooked in such discussions, was here .distinctly  examined, namely: Whether Churches not practic-  i ing immersion exclusively, were valid Churches offi Christ-    '          '  The Colporteur was proceeding to examine into the Scriptural import of the word Baptizo, when the : company were invited to an evening repast.  While at tea, Mr. Atkinson remarked that he hoped the discussion had -not been unpleasant to any of the company, and that no results prejudicial to Christian charity would follow. A smile passed   SCRIPTl'UAL BAPTISM.      .' ,over the countenance of Mr. Wilmot, while Mr. Judd repeated the words of that beautiful hymn: "Among the saints on earth Let mutual love abound; Heirs of the same inheritance, With mutual blessings crowned. "Thus will the Church below Resemble that above, Where streams of endless pleasure flow, And every heart is love." "Well," said Mr. Alvord, "there is one place where we can all come together in the spirit' of a true communion." "Where is that?" said Mr. Bennett. "Around the table of our friend Atkinson," said 'Mr. Alvord. "I trust so," said Mr. Nixon; "but there is yet another place, where, if we are true Christians, we shall meet in the spirit of a truer communion." "Pray, and where may that be?" said Mr. Wil- mot, somewhat moved, thinking he referred to the communion table. "In Heaven," was the reply. "Oh! that alters the case," ejaculated Mr. Wil- mot, half audibly. "That   alters the case," repeated Mr. Judd. "How   is that? Is the Church on earth holier than   ". T. ar lp       AM hY.  , JUDD VA, '. - the Church in heaven, or is it becoming in us to i refuse communion with those on earth, whom God  i will admit to the communion of saints in heaven?"  This sharp rebut of Mr. Judd, sensibly aroused a the resentment of Mr, Wilmot, which the Colporteur i observing, said:  "Come, brethren, drop this matter, lest you marH the harmony of feeling. For my part, I love all Christians, and can cheerfully unite with them in the Lord's Supper. If others think they have reason for refusing communion with me, I cannot help it. They are not accountable to me, but to the one Master, Christ. Good .men may err without intend-  ing it. Hence, however I may deplore such a course in others, that fact shall not prevent, in me, the  free flow of generous Christian feeling toward others." To these sentiments of the Colporteur, there was a silent response; for, the utterance of such feelings always finds an echo in Christian hearts.     The attention of the company had been so com- pletely occupied with- the subject of debate, that'  before they were aware, the hour/of ten had arrived. v It was, therefore, thought advisable not to renew it that evening.

"But how did you like the Colporteur's views?'"   68       THB JUDD F-AMTT Y*  said Mr. Alvord, anxious to know more particularly  the result of his second thoughts.  "Why, you know, neighbor Alvord, where I  have always stood on that question. It has always  seemed to me, that immersion was the Scriptural  mode; but then, I ouldn't get along with close communion. And then, too, there has always been  a sort of mist about it in my mind; but, I confess,  the Colporteur threw new light upon the subject; and I begin to think that first impressions are not always the truest, or the safest. The fact is, I've  never fairly examined the subject."  "You were brought up in a Baptist family, I  think I've heard you say," said Mr. Alvord. "I was.'" "That Xill aecount for: your prepossessions on  that subject. I too, was brought up by Baptist parents; and, therefore, know how to sympathize with you. Why, neighbor Judd, I used to hear it  so often asserted, in the most positive terms, that immersion was the only Scriptural and valid mode,  and sprinkling and pouring ridiculed as a wicked, popish innovation, that I really thought it must be so; and it was only after careful examination, that  I changed my mind." "Just so," said Mr. Judd, "from  what I heard  talked in the family, and what the minister said  when he came to visit us, I supposed, of course    SCRIPTUREAL BAPTISM.     69 that anything but immersion was impious and wick- ed. But, as I said, I begin to think that first im- pressions are not always truest. I am not fairly settled yet, but I mean to look into this thing a little deeper." Then, after a moment's thought, he, added: "I should really like a further interview with the Colporteur, as he had but just begun to explain his views of the Scriptural mode of Baptism, when we broke up, last evening; and, for my part, I'd like to know what he thinks upon that subject; for he said he had examined it pretty thoroughly; and from the way he talked, I should think he had." "As to that, I presume you can be gratified," said Mr. Alvord, "as I understand he dedsigns to call upon all the families in the town, and will, there- fore, call on you." "How did the Coporteur s views meet your mind, neighbor Alvord?" "As far as he went, I fully approved of them. He took a view different from that generally held, of Rom. vi, 4, 5, and Col. II, 21, making them refer to the Spiritual Baptism. I had always supposed they referred to water Baptism; but after hearing his explanations, I am satisfied he is right."

'"You will admit 'that the ordinances of the Gos- pel, are -adapted to the penitent upon the 'bed of 7 sickness--to the Arab upon the burning  sands of Africa-and to the Greenlander in his hut of snow, I in the depth of winter.

Must he wait for a long six months, that shall so mellow down the fierceness of the cold, by the return of a July sun, as to make immersion possible? "Now, Brother Judd, do you, or can you be- lieve that the merciful Savior, who would ' not break a bruised reed,' requires any such risks of a sick- bed-any such pilgrimages, or delays? What end is answered by immersion, that is not as effectually , answered by pouring or sprinkling?"  Mr. Judd listened attentively, and, for the mo-  ment, these arguments of Mr. .Alvord seemed- to carry conviction to his mind. But, the 'power of habit, as it shows itself in attachment to precon- ceived opinions, does not relinquish its hold without  a stxuggle.  An honest mind is- fearfil of falling into error, and, therefore, proceeds cautiously in the'  work of examining new theories, or supposed facts,  i presented for its acceptance. Such  was the .case with Mr. Judd. 'Though seeming to be carried, for the moment, by 1the ar- guments of the Colporteur, on the evening previous, and, now, by Mr. Alvord; yet, he wold not be yel, w ul d not -be *    2      THE JUDD JAMLY.' hasty in finally adopting them. And then, too, a  shade of doubt seemed to hang yover his mind; so he replied: - -             i  "But, if God requires us to be immersed in or-  der to Baptism, is it becdming in us to inquire what  is to be gained by it? Is it not enough, in this ease, that God requires it?"  "Very true, neighbor Judd, but that is the point' that needs proving. Does God require it? If he does, it is, and ntust be, right.; for he requires noth- ing needless, or wrong. (The reasons that influence  His decisions, are often beyond our knowledge. But however obscure the connection between means and ends may appear to us, there certainly is such a connection. And, it is equally clear, that God's requirements aim at our present, and eternal well-  being. In regard, therefore, to the duty of Baptism, as of all other duties, it is doubtless our privilege  and our right, to inquire into its nature and design, and to learn, as far as possible, the reasons for its  requirement. l repeat; does God require Baptism by immer  sion? To the law and the testimony, if we speak  not according to the oracles of God, it is because, in this ease, there is no light in us. Appealing to  the Sacred Oracles, is it notsingular that the evi-l dense should be so dim, if they do require immersion, that four-fifths of the Christian world cannot fin4 it-?   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.        3 "God's positive commands are stated in plain and simple language; so plain, that 'the wayfaring. man, though a fool' simple and unlearned, 'need not err therein.' If the mode of Baptism is left to mere inference, as it certainly is, it is because the mere mode, is of secondary importance, and to be governed by the great end contemplated in the or- dinance. "Such being the case, it is entirely proper for us to inquire, what good end is to be attained by it? And, to raise the further question, whether sprink- ling and pouring do not answer that end, as well, or better, than immersion?" As the reader will perceive, the proper solution of the question, suggested in Mr. Alvord's remarks,  involves the design of Baptism. Correct views upon this point, will aid in settling the question of the mode. If water Baptism is an ordinance of Chris- tianity, what object or end does it subserve? "If it is nerely a form of acknowledging the right of the baptized to membership, in the visible Church, and if no higher end is sought by it, then, the question of cotnveninced will have much to do  in settling the question in favor of sprinkling. 'If we look upon it in the light of a solemn  covenant transaction, in which we publicly bind our- selves to a life of holy obedience to God: an act requiring collectedness of thought, and calm de- 'I    74,      THE .JUDD FAMLY. votional feeling; what place so suitable as the House  of worship, and what mode so adapted to shut out  physical excitement, and leave the soul to ita calm communion with God, as sprinkling at the altar of consecration??  "4If now, we connect with this, the symbolic  ; character of the rite; the question will then arise, what truth, or fact, is sylnbolized by Baptism? "Is it not clearly this: that, as water is the great cleansing agent, and as it is indispensable to  vegetable and animal life, so it is, at once, the ap- propriate, and unchanging emblem of the cleansing, life-giving, and life-sustaining work, and influence of the Holy Spirit. It thus not only symbolizes the work of the Spirit, in the Spiritual Baptism, but in receiving it, the Christian sets his seal to the fact of his lost and polluted condition, and of his need of that moral cleansing, wrought upon the heart in the higher Baptism." Mri Alvord was about to give other reasons for not believing immersion to be the Scriptural and advisable mode, when he was interrupted by a gen- tie rap at the door, and upon opening it, Mr. Judd met the Colporteur, with his basket of books, "-Good morning, Mr.. Nixon," said Mr. Judd, with a hearty shake of his hand. "Walk in and take a seat." It was one of those calm, mellow mornings of I.   SCRHPTURAL BAPTISM.     75 Autumn, so frequently enjoyed in Michigan.. The leaves of the maples and young oaks, touched by the early frost, had put on a hue of beauteous orim- son. The beech, and the hazel were opening their burs; and the hickory, the butternut, and the black walnut, were each: depositing their oily treasures uponi the bosom of mother earth. The forests-were vocal with the nervous chatter of, the red squirrel, as he bounded from limb to limb, or, in anger, pur- sued the black squirrel to his hole in some hollow tree. These with the chipping squirrels, were all happy in their harvest work, laying up their win- ter's store--interrupted and frightened, not and then, by the intrusion upon tWeir domains of noisy school-boys, come to share with them the treasures of the forest, and lay up, each, a store of nuts for the pastime of the long winter evenings. Such days are often followed by cold, rainy- and unpleasant weather, and therefore, the provident farmer husbands the fair and pleasant days, to' gather in his crops, and get his domestic affairs in good condition for winter.' But pressing as were the labors of the farm, Mr. Judd would willingly forego them, for the sake of learning more upon this topic of Christian priv-  ilege, and duty. So, after a few passing remarks, Mr. Judd proposed to put out Mr. Nixon's horse,  and have the topic of the previous evening still .   B6      THE JUDD FAMTY. further discussed. To this the Colporteur objected, however, as it was important that this fair weather should be improved in canvassing the town. Mr. Judd then inquired if he could so arrange { his work as to spend the ensuing evening with him. To this the Colporteur consented. It was, accord. ingly, arranged that 'Mr. Nixon should spend the day in visiting the several families of the neighbor  hood, and return to Mr. Judd's at evening.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM,      " CHUAPTER IV. Oh! truth divine! how beautiful thou art, How full of power to purify the heart; Thy silent flowings wake the soul to love, And make the saints below like those above. T IS exceedingly difficult to divest ourselvesof denominational prepossessions, and to take  i broad, unsectarian view of our duty, so difficult that but few, in the present stage of Christian develop- ment, ever get the mastery of themselves so as not to be insensibly warped by denominational pride. And, even when we have the broadest charity for Christians of other denominations, it is an inevitable result of even a just denominational preference to desire that all others should think as we do. Such were Mr. Bennett's feelings. He had silently hoped, yet, to gather Mr. and Mrs. Judd into his church. The discussion of the previous evening had con- siderably disturbed this hope; and when, on this day, he learned that the Colporteur was to be the guest of Mr. Judd in the evening, he felt a great   78       ToIE:, JUDD VAVJT;Y.[  anxiety to be present, and watch the motion of things; and, if need be, to put in his disclaimer. It so happened that his wish was gratified; for Mr. Judd, thinking that others would be as much inter. ested as himself, and anxious to have no ex parte affair, bethought himself to give the company of' the previous evening, including Mr. Bennett, an in- vitation to be present. It was a calm and beautiful evening-fit close of a beautiful day. Light and airy clouds hung in the western sky, and the harvest moon, full orbed, was, with matronly grace, smiling down upon the earth, from, her gentle elevation in the eastern' heaven; and so ful of light was she, that the stays seemed, to blush in her presence, and modestly veil their faceas At an early hour the parlor of Mr. Judd was light ed, and ready for the expected company.

"Let me see,' said Mr, Juddd, "I think that when we were called to tea last evening, you were about giving your views of the Scriptural mode of Baptism," addressing the 0olporteur. "Very true," said, he. "But before I proceed, I wish it distinctly understood, that in my opinion (though I have no proof that any, in Apostolic time si were Baptized by immersion), yet those thus im,     g mersed are, without doubt, validly Baptized. I have, therefore, no Church organisation to defend, -whose  denominational -existence depends upon the mainte- nanee of some fixed mode."     *     - Here Mr. Bennett claimed the Colporteurs at" tention for a moment. He wished to say to him,  that entertaiining such views (and he believed that such were the views of Pedo,-Baptists generaly)-, he did not see why they could not- yield, 'that which   I they deemed non-essential, for the sake of 'nity, since the Baptists had oonscientiouS objections to  any other mode than im mersion.

To this the Colporteur replied:  4-"While we hold that the mode is but a cireumnz stance of the rite, and that Baptism is above any  mere mode, so that the Baptism taking place by immersion is valid; yet, we believe there is one mode more Scriptural and better fitted to meet the varying circumstances of the Church, and better adapted to set forth the design of- the rite, than  any other. The mode, therefore, is not a matter of indifference, or, wholly of convenience, with Us g We, too, have our conscientious scruples as to the mode. "For one, I could never consent to immersion, entertaining the views I do, for I should feel that I was setting at naught the pattern given me in the Word, as I understand it, and by my acts, con- tradict the wisdom of God. "It is true," he continued, " that, in a subordi-E nate sense, it is non-essential, and should never stand as a Jar to the higher ends of Church unity, and Christian love. But since God's test of fealty to himself is, the conscientious discharge of duty, as we understand it, and, since, as I think, He prizes the soul's integrity far above all forms, however proper they may be in themselves, it is the duty of each one to judge for himself as to what God re-t quires, and then to obey his own convictions, with- out interference from any one.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      8I "With these views, if a penitent sinner comes to me for Baptism, I should feel bound to administer it in that mode which would meet his convictions of duty, in that regard." "But," said Mr. Bennett, "if God requires im- mersion for Baptism, as I think He does, then sprinkling and pouring cannot be valid Baptism; and I could never Baptize any one in those modes, however much they might desire it." "And so you would make your conscience the guide for another man, and assume an infallibility of opinion over him. You certainly would not de- mand of another what you would not be willing to grant. With your present views, you could never      onsent to anly other mode than immersion?"  "Certainly not," said Mr. Bennett. "Will you not, then, grant another the same      I right you claim for yourself?"              Mr. Bennett replied, "I would let him go to iome one whose convictions ran in the same chan-     iel with his own." "And so you would turn away a penitent sinner     I iom an ordinance of God's house, because he could lot see his duty through your eyes?  For one,I  hould fear there was something wrong in my faith,    ' hat I had magnified a rite of the general Church, ut of its place, and that I was straining at a gnat." Mr. Bennett made no rep'ly. Thd Judd Family.   6   8?      TEE JITDD FAMTT-Y.  The Colporteur resumed:  "Now, in regard to the Scriptural mode of Baptism, I can only present it as it appears to my mitid,:in a careful study of the Word upon this point, and then leave it with you, my friends, each for himself, to judge how far these views harmonize with Ithat Word.      i "To get at this question in a manner as brief? and simple as possible, let me raise the inquiry-  What is the essential Baptism?          i "The answer that any unbiased mind will give, I apprehend, is this. It is the Baptism  which  Christ Baptized with. John said, 'I indeed baptize you with water-H-e (Christ) shall baptize you with  the Holy . Ghost.' "This was the promise of the Father, given by the mouth of JOEL, II, 8: 'And it shall come to pass in-the last days, saith God, I will pour out jj my spirit upon all flesh.' For this they were to j tarry (or wait,) in Jerusalem, as for a Divine spir- itual endowment, fitting them with undying love  and zeal for their great life-work. "'But tarry ye in Jerusalem,' said Jesus, 'till ye be endowed with power from on high. For ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.' The Apostles did so wait and the promise was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. Luke tells us, Acts II, 1, 4, 'And when the day of Pea. tecost was fully come, they were .all with one a .   SCRtTURAL BAPTISM.        83 cord in one place.  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.; And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.' "This is the Baptism that Christ Baptizes with, and this I call the real, essential Baptism." "It was the bestowiment of miraculous gifts," said Mr. Bennett, "nothing more; and therefore, not applicable to all believers, and consequently, not true Christian Baptism." "Are you sure of that?" said the Colporteur      : "Quite sure," said he. "See! They began to speak with other tongues." "Brother Bennett," said the Colporteur, "please answer me  this question. Had not the Apostles been favored with the gift of miracles long before  this?" With some   little confusion, Mr. Bennett con-  fessed that such was the case. "The truth is, this Baptism of the  Spirit was not the bestowment of miraculous gifts, as you sup"    ^ pose, but rather a Divine illumination of their mindS  with Truth, giving a wonderful inspiration of love  nd zeal, and filling them with boldness and courage. "You will notice also, that the promise was  of universal avOlieation to believers. 'I will pour out   84       THE JUDD FAMLY. my Spirit upon all flesh,'-all true believers. And  then, too, that the promise was designed to be gen- eral is clear from the fact that it was fulfilled on ! the Samaritan, believers, upon the occasion of that j great revival, under the preaching of Phillip, when such multitudes believed in Christ, as recorded in j the 8th chapter of Acts. When the news of this  ! great work reached the Apostles, at Jerusalem, they j sent down Peter and John. 'Who, when they were : come down, prayed for them, that they might re-  : ceive the Holy Ghost; for, as yet, He was fallen  upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.' The same gift was after-.  wards bestowed upon-Cornelius and his household, and other Gentile friends, gathered to receive the j message at the mouth of Peter.  The record is  i (Acts x, 44), ' While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.' This is what I call the real Baptism, with- out which all the water Baptisms in the world are of little worth." "That's my mind exactly," said Mrs. Atkinson. "Exactly! exactly! And I don't see any need of water Baptism any way.  Paul says, 'One Lord, one Faith, and one baptism,'-not two-and that one, the Spiritual Baptism,"-her eyes brightening up with the thought.              a "But I suppose Mrs. Atkinson will not object   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      85 to the use of the outward symbol of it," said the Colporteur, "since Paul and Peter, and, so far as we can learn, all the other Apostles practiced it. Did not Paul arise and be Baptized at the sugges- tion of Ananias? So, also, did not Peter say of Cornelius and his friends, after they had received the Spiritual Baptism, 'Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized as well as we?' 'And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.' Acts x, 47, 48."          j "Very true," said Mrs. Atkinson, "but my parents used to tell me that the Apostles did. it in'  I conformity to Jewish prejudices-that they knew it was useless and wrong-but calculated it would run out after a while."  "Did you ever think what an attitude such an hypothesis would put the Apostles into-of giving their voluntary sanction to that which was useless and wrong?   And you see it has not 'run out,' nor become obsolete, for water Baptism has been in use    from that day to this. And then, too, such a posi- tion, had they really taken it, would have shown a   i great blindness to the practical workings of error (to suppose it would ever run out, or dease), by being winked at, or indulged. All forms of error, and wrong-doing, gather strength from indulgence. "The Apostles, too, it must be remembered, were under the special inspiration of the Holy Spirit;   86       THE JUDD FAMLY. and, therefore, would never have given their sano- tion to that which was simple, or even useless. You will please also notice, in the case of Corne. lius and his household, that that argument has no force; for they were Gehtiles, and not the victims of Jewish prejudice. No one, I think, can take the narrative of the conversion and Baptism of Corne- lius and his friends, into candid consideration, with-  out seeing that Peter thought water Baptism, in O their case, eminently right and proper." "Well, for my part, I can't see what good water Baptism does, any way," said -Mrs. Atkinson. "It  doesn't wash away sin, and it's only an outward ceremony. If there's any good in it, I'd like to, know what it is." "If Mrs. Atkinson will listen, I will try to answer her question," said the Colporteur. "There, were those, in Apostolic times, who raised the same ob- jection to circumcision that you do to Baptism. Paul anticipates the objection, and answers, 'Much every way.' There is almost an exact parallel be- tween circumcision and Baptism, in the general scope and design of the two ordinances. Circum- cision in the flesh, was a standing symbol of the purity of heart wrought by 'Spiritual circumcision. They were both outward seals of the covenant of Grace, into which God enters with his believing people. The one was adapted to the shadowy dis-   sCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      8 pensation, by which God was educating the world, and preparing it for the final ushering in of the second, and more glorious dispensation of the same covenant of grace and salvation, revealed in the incarnation and atonement of Christ. The other was to be equally a seal of that covenant, and an unalterable symbol of the purifying and life-giving power of the Holy Spirit, in His work upon the heart. Both stood at the door of the temple of Truth, pointing significantly to the beauty and glory that dwelt within." "That is a beautiful thought, and one I had      \ never considered before," said Mrs. Atkinson. , "I am aware," continued the Colporteur, "that the class of professing Christians who call them- selves Friends, are opposed to all ordinances, as tending to formality, but this prejudice has arisen from observing the abuse, rather than from a proper   X use of the; They are symbols and remembrancers      I of great vitalizing and life-giving truths, in them-   i selves as unchangeable as God.  They illustrate,    i and perpetuate the knowledge of such truths. It     i were unsafe to commit permanent truths wholly to written, or to spoken language for two reasons.     i a 1.

Its terms and its meaning are constantly  changing and passing into disuse.  "' It was for these reasons, as I think, that God took care to enshrine the immutable truths of re.- ligion, in a language that would not change. He, therefore, selected the language of things, rather  than the language of words-a language always  definite, significant, and transparent. He enshrined  his religion in the unambiguous dialect of Symbols,  as a safe, and appropriate medium to convey them  to the latest times."              i "There is a world of important truth in that j thought," said Mr. Bennett. "But don't you think I that Baptism was' also designed to symbolize the  burial and resurrection of Christ?"       "I cannot say that I do," rejoined Mr. Nixon. . "I am aware that our Baptist brethren so think;  but I have never been able to get any proof of it.  Indeed, we have another ordinance by which His  death and atoning work, and His unselfish love as  the fountain, is set forth, symbolized and commem- orated-the  communion of the  Lord's Supper. His death and resurrection are historic facts, and need no symbols to perpetuate them. It is: the in-  ner, and more vitalizing truths, to be embraced in the heart, rather than in the intellect, that need to  be thus symbolized." "But, after all," said Mr. Bennett, "I cannot   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      89 resist the impression that Baptism is symbolical of His death and resurrection. 'FPor if we have been buried in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.' i  "Planted, my brother, not buried." "The metaphor fails," said the Colporteur. "There is no doubt that a lively imagination can discover a resemblance between the immersion and emersion of a person, and Christ's burial and resur- rection; but, after all, there is more faney than fact in it, at least, it is so to my mind." "It seems, then, that you think water Baptism a symbol of the work of the Holy Spirit, in purify- ing and working   life in the heart of the believer,' said Mr. Judd. "That, I believe to be its symbolic design.  It also a solemn form of visibly entering into   orv-. enant with God, through Christ; and of acknowl- edging that we are polluted and lost, and that we need the -moral cleansing symbolized in Baptism. The appropriateness of the   emblem   will be  seen from the following facts.  Water is the   essential element in all vegetable and animal life.  Imagine a world without a single drop of water, and  how desolate and   cheerless would it  be!   No  stately forests with verdure clad; no beautiful flowers of va- negated hues, exhaling their fragrance on the   moist and balmy air; no growing herbs, nor grasses green, 90       THE JUDD FAMLY.         i nor herds and flocks, nor birds of song; nothing but one--vast desolation.  "Such is the soul of man without God. No life :-spiritual life; no beauty; no blessedness-a moral desolation. The descent of the Spirit upon the heart, I like the gentle showers upon the earth, brings with ; it, life, beauty and fruitfulness. 'He shall come  down upon them like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.'" Is that quotation from  the   seventy-second  Psalm, a prophesy of the work of the Spirit, in the Spiritual Baptism?" said Mr. Judd, a new thought : seeming to inspire him. "I so- understand it."            ( "I'm a convert! I'm a convert'!" ejaculated Mr.  Judd, with evident emotion.            "A convert to what?" said Mr. Bennett, with some concern. "I see it now! I see it!" continued Mr. Judd.  "' I will pour out my Spirit.' ' He shall come down line rain.' 'The Holy Spirit fell on them.' Yel! J yes, I see it." -       i "See what?" repeated Mr. Bennett. "I see the analogy between water Baptism, and  s the Baptism of the Spirit, as to the mode, it is theD t same in either case. The Spiritual Baptism comes by a pouring out, and a falling upon; the water E Baptism should come in the same way. John said,   SUKLf'I'URAL BAPTISM.     91  'I indeed baptize you with water, not in it.  The in only shows the place where it was done, the with shows the manner of doing it." "I don't know  about that,:" said Mr. Bennett. "If we were to give up immersion as the exclusive mode, there would be no special difference between us and the Congregationalists, or other Evangelical Churches. The distinctive policy of our Churches is based upon it." ' Do you think Baptist Churches would suffer any loss of piety, or influence, or usefulness, were they to give up 'close Baptism,' as you call it, and the restricted communion based upon it?" said the Colporteur. "I    don't know," said   Mr. Bennett, "I  must think about it." "I hope you will," said Mr. Judd.  "If it had not been for that, I should have joined your Church long ago." "Brother Bennett," said the Colporteur, "have you ever investigated the doctrine  of the  passage in the First Epistle of John, v, 8, where he says, 'There are three that bear witness in -earth-the spirit, and; the  water, -and  the  blood; and  these three agree in one ?'" "I don't know    as I have.  Do you think' there is any allusion to Baptism in it?" "I do, most certainly."    92       THE JUDD FADfMTY. "Please to give us your exegesis of it." "Well, to get a fair understanding of this pas. sage, please to' notice the following particulars. First, The spirit, and the water, and the blood are three  witnesses. Second, They testify to some fact. Third, They agree-in one--method, mode, or man-  i ner of bearing their testimony."      -   : "I see,' said Mr. Bennett. Mr. Judd gave a   i significant nod of his head, as if to say, "I see it too."  "Let us now inquire, what fact, or truth, it is, N to which they bear testimony. Look at man as a sinner, polluted, ruined, lost. What question of such J absorbing interest, as the one whether he can be  restored to the Divine favor? Whether his sins   can be washed away, and he restored to purity and life? Saved. To an awakened conscience, how this  question bears upon the mind. Will my offended ( Lord be gracious, will He, can He pardon, and re.  store me to purity, to life? And if so, how can He, and what agency will He employ?  Man lost and pollated! But God is love; and from the deep s fountains of that love, there comes a remedy-onfe  just suited to our condition, and it challenges our faith and love. It bears to our troubled soul the Truth we most need to know. And here are God's  three witnesses come to assure us of the fact. Hear   SURIPTURAL BAPTISM.       93 their testimony. Let us call them on the stand, in the order named in this passage. "1st. The Spirit. 'Ye must be born again;'- born of the Spirit. 'The Spirit itself beareth wit- ness that we are born of God.' ' We shall be bap- tized (purified) with the Holy Ghost.' "It is a truth recognized by all evangelical Christians, Baptist Churches included, that the Holy Spirit is the source and efficient agent of all spirit- ual life. And purity is the essential condition of life. Love is the essential element in all purity. Love is of God. ' The love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.' Thus, in a word, the peculiar work of the Spirit, is to enlighten, purify, and save sinners, and to this great work it bears its testimony. "2d. The testimony of the water. 'I will sprin- kle clean water upon you, and "ye shall 'be clean   ! from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you.' - 'So shall He sprinkle many nations.' . 'Sprinkle water of purifying upon them.' 'Arise,    j and be baptized, and wash away your sins.'  "Thus, all through the Divine Word, water is  regarded as the agent of physical purity, and as a   I symbol, bears its testimony to moral or spiritual    ; purity, "3d. Now let us listen to the testimony of the   '[ third witness-the blood. i   "     '  THE JUDD rAMT^.. "'And by the Law almost all things are purged with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission. ' The blood of His Son, Jesus Christ, cleanseth from all sin.' "These items might be greatly multiplied, but these are sufficient. Here, then, we have three wit- nesses bearing testimony to the fact of moral purity } -that God has set his heart on sinners, and is e -E ploying all the means at His command to save them from their sins-to purify their hearts by Faith, and to fit them for the purity and the bliss of heaven.  "But they agree in the manner, or mode, of bearing their testimony. Let us, then, mark thip agreement. "The mode in which the Spirit bears its testi- mony, is by a pouring out, and falling upon, 'He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass.' "The blood bears its testimony in the same waye. 'For when Moses had spoken every precept to allthe people, according to the Law, he took the blood of ' calves, and of goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the peo- ple.' 'For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the,  ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the Xiving   5v;51r'1'U-KAIJ MrAl'TIOM#  ,6 God.

"Here are two of the witnesses, who bear their testimony by affusion, or sprinkliang, Does the water agree with them? John says it" does, for they agree in one. Let us, then, see what; is said of this mat- ter in the Word.' "In Isa. Lr, 1!3, 14, 15, we have a most graphia prophetic description of the sufferings of Christ, in His atoning deaths and of the glory that should follow, in souls redeemed and purified among many nations. 'As many were astonished at thee; (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men). So shall he sprin- kle many nations.' "Ezekiel narrates with prophetic clearness, the same blessed work of purifying under the gospel. 'Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean, from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleans you- A  new heart also will I give you.' Ezek, xxxvi, 25, 26. "Now but one of two inferences can be drawn from these passages of Scripture. Either they con, tain a prophetic statement of water Baptismn, under the Gospel,' as the terms would seem to indicate, or the Spiritual Baptism is prophesied of. In either ease, it is a sprinkling, and not an immersion. If   -96       TfTHE JUDD 'FAMLY. water Baptism is here referred to, then here is your warrant for sprinkling. And if the Spiritual Bap. tism is here spoken of under the emblem of water sprinkled upon them, then, surely, the symbol should agree with the fact; and if the three witnesses H agree in the mode or manner of bearing their tes- timony, as this passage asserts. then the water must bear its testimony by a pouring out, and falling upon, like rain upon the mown grass.") "There," said Mr. Judd, "what can you say to that, Brother Bennett? Is'nt it as clear-as a sun- beam?"  "I have nothing to say at present," said Mr. Bennett.  I must think about it. It does not agree with my opinions. I confess, I am not prepared to answer the argument of Mr. Nixon. I was not, -aware that there was the weight of argument on that side of the question, that has been shown to- night and last night. Possibly I may be wrong. I am not, however, convinced of it at present; but I mean to reexamine the whole subject." "Well, for my part, T believe I have got my eyes open," said Mr. Judd. "I see a beauty and significance in Baptism I never saw before, and it draws my heart up to God, in strong desires for the higher Baptism; and I feel as though I want to receive both the symbol,' and the thing signified,    and to publicly enter into covenant with God, and His people, and seal myself ris forever." "Amen," said Mr. Alvord, highly delighted with the progress Mr. Judd was making in the way of Truth. On 'the second Sabbath but one, after the inter- view narrated above, a large audience gathered at the Congregational Church to witness the consum- mation of the ardent wishes of Mr. Judd. But he was not alone. Mrs. Judd, who had been a silent listener to the facts and truths that had won her husband, found her heart sweetly drawn in the same direction; and she too rejoiced to receive the seal of the covenant. And what is most singular, they came with their household, the children of their mutual love, now  dearer to them than ever. 'Being Christ's, they were Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise,' and as such they re- oeived Baptisin, a seal of the righteousness of Faith; and the seal of the covenant was placed  on their children, as the 'seal of circumcision' had been placed on Abraham's children, 'who is the  father   j of us all.'         ' The steps that led  to this further change of view, and the consequent Baptism of their children, will be narrated in a subsequent chapter. It was a joyful hour to Mr. and Mrs. Judd, when at the close of the morning service, they presented The Judd Family.  7   98       THEi J"DD PFAttil t themselves and their children -fix in all--at the altar of consecration. And when the Pastor, Rev. Mr. Truman, poured the water of consecration upon the head of Mr. Judd, and pronounced the words, I Baptize thee in the name of the .Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit fell like electric shocks, thrilling every nerve of his body, and so filling him with light and love, that it was some moments before he so came to himself as to be able to rise from his kneeling posture. The reader need hardly be assured of the solemn,  and yet joyful feeling pervading that large audience. The silent tear that moistened many an eye, betrayed emotions too deep for utterance. Mr. Alvord, in particular, was so overcome 'with joy that he wept like a child. With a heart overflowing with broad Christian charity, what cared he if Mr. Judd had not united with his branch of the Church. He had found a home, where he could meet him at the communion table, as well as in the prayer and con- ference meeting, and it was enough.   CH APTER V. T THE time of the events narrated in previous chapters, the Rev Mr. Truman, the Pastor of the Congregational Church, was absent with his wife, on a visit to her parents, in the eastern part of the State, and did not return until after the gathering at Mr. Judd's. He stood high among his parishioners as a man of piety and learning, possessing an open, ingenuous countenance, and that approachability that made even the poorest of his flock feel at home in his presence. He drew  men toward him by the cords of a strong sympathy; a sympathy his winning man- ner and gentle words- inspired. This gentility and suavity of deportment is more the result of the soul's genuine sympathy with Christ, in his great work of lifting a world out of the ruins of sin, than from any lessons taken at the feet of a Chesterfield. Divine love in the heart, gushing out in the eye, breathing forth in the voice, and creating an overflowing compassion for the erring and the lost, L ..gA   100       THE JUDD FPAMTILY. i . and a yearning tenderness toward the helpless and the ignorant, will do more to form the true gentle mnan, than all the heartless rules of your modern amateurs in gentlemanly breeding.  The two most important qualifications of a min ister of the Gospel, are a mind thoroughly disciplined and enlightened with Truth, and a heart overflowing with love.         1- These qualifications Mr. Truman possessed in a good degree, which enabled him to apprehend Truth X in its elemlental and fundamental principles, and to present it with such clearness of statement, that the  most uneducated of his parishioners could apprehend and feel it. In the afternoon of the day following Mr. Tru- man's return home, Mr. Judd sat by his own fire in deep thought, while Mrs. Judd sat quietly engaged in sewing. At length, rousing up, he said, "Wife, what do you think of infant Baptism?" "I don't know as I have any thoughts about it," she replied. "I've heard Elder Bennett speak of it quite disdainfully, and call it a relic'of popery; and i when Mr. and Mrs. Alvord had their children Bap-  tized by the Presiding Elder, at the Quarterly Meet- ing, Mrs. Wilmot stuck up her nose, and called it  baby-sprinkling.'"  "Well," said Mr. Judd, "it's either right or wrong, and I'm going to inquire into it. If it's   UtIJ Ir URA. vAb'I. DRJll.. XLVI. right, it is our duty to have our children Baptized; and if it is wrong, we ought to know it. I've a plan in my head." "What is it?" "I've a notion to ask the two -ministers, Mr. Ben- nett and Mr. Truman, to tea to-morrow afternoon, and when they are here, I'll introduce the subject, and we will learn what they can say for- and against it. In that way we can get Mr. Bennett's strongest objections to it, and Mr. Truman's best arguments for it." "I think it would be a good plan, myself," said Mrs. Judd. ," It's a subject I am in no way prepared to judge of, or to act upon, and yet it may be a duty we owe our children." It was accordingly agreed upon, that the two ministers should be invited to tea on the following day. And when Mr. Judd gave them the invitation, he deemed it proper to hint to each one the .object he had in view, so that each might previously refresh his memory with the best arguments for and against. Now it so happened, that on the Sabbath pre- vious, Mr. and Mrg. Judd listened to a sermon from Mr. Bennett, in which he made -the statement that God had no organized or visible Church on earth, till after the coming of Christ; the Abrahamie cov- enant referred only to temporal blessings, and was designed to serve a temporal end only. At the time,  .    .   102       THUE JUDD, AMTT Y.. Xr., Judd thought nothing of it. He had often heard suoh sentiments expressed by Baptist ministers with.. out raising the inquiry as to whether they were right or wrong. But the next morning, at family worship, as he read the third chapter of Galatians, he paused two or three times while reading, as if in deep thought, upon the current of the Apostle's reasoning, without making any comments at the time, however. But, after prayer, he took, up his Bible and sat down for a review of the chapter. His mind seemed to dwell particularly on the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  Know ye, therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the Scrip. ture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abra- ham, saying, in there shl all nations be blessed." Passing down the page, his eye rested on the 14th verse. "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might  receive the promise of the Spirit through faith,*" ;He stopped, and inquired within himself "What is the blessing of Abraham?" W' Why,', soliloquized he to himself, 0"'it must be the blessing of the Abrahamic covenant; and this with all its train of good has come upon the Gen-   SCRIPTBAL BAPTISM   .    108 tiles." His eye passed back up the page to the 8th verse. "And the Gospel was preached to Abra- ham, and he believed it, and it was accounted to him for righteousness." "I see it!  I see it!"  he exclaimed. "The Abrahamic covenant was a Gospel covenant, and Elder Bennett was mistaken. That's certain." Mr. Judd did not then see the bearing of this truth upon the question of Infant Baptism; and for the present we will let him rest where he is. Sub- sequent discussions may lead him to a just' appre- ciation of this fact. Our progress in truth is a step at a time. Jesus taught his disciples as they were able to bear it. \ *"   104      THE JUDD FAMLY.  CHA PTEER VI.  EE HOJUR at length arrived, and the two min- isters met at Mr. Judd's. After the usual civil- ities, Mr. Judd opened the subject by  saying, "Brethren, my mind has been drawn to the subject of Infant Baptism of late, and I feel anxious to settle the question for myself as a matter of duty; and Mrs. Judd shares with me in this desire. We have a family of children growing up, and we owe to them the duty of training them in the nurture and admonition of the- Lord. Infant Baptism iss right or wrong. If right, then it is our duty to have them Baptized. It is this question that we wish you to help us settle. As our ignorance of the Scriptures, especially upon this point, is so great, we wish you to discuss its merits, for and against. Listening to your arguments, we hope to be able to arrive at just and Scriptural views upon this im- portant subject." Then turning to Mr. Truman, he said: "You believe Infant Baptism to be Scriptural and right, and practice accordingly?"   SORIPTURAL BAPTISM.1     10o *"I do, most certainly." "And you think it un-scriptural and wrong, and, therefore, you are opposed to it?" "I do," said Mr. Bennett, with emphasis. "Here, then, you are fairly at issue," said Mr. Judd. "Will Brother Bennett state his objections somewhat in detail?" "I have several objections," said Mr. Bennett. "1. I can find no command in- the New Testa- ment to Baptize children, nor any examples of In- fant Baptism. "2. I can find nothing but believers' Baptism. Jesus said,'He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.' Infants cannot believe, and therefore should not be Baptized. "3. I am opposed to it because it is useless. What good can it do to Baptize an unconscious babe? "4. It deprives the child of its own choice, and of going forward in Baptism upon the profession of its own Faith. "5. And I am opposed to it, because I believe it to be a relic of popery.," "Well," said Mr. Truman, smiling, "Brother Bennett, your faith on that subject is rather of the negative order. Is Infant Baptism any where for- bidden in the Scriptures?"   t06 '-     TSM JUDD FAIY H "I don't know that it is, in express terms, but I think it is by implication." "From  what particular fact, or circumstance, stated in the Scriptures, do you draw your infer', ence?" said Mr. Truman. "The Savior said, 'He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' Infants cannot believe, and, there. fore, should not be Bapti'ed." "So you think infants to be unbelievers, do you?" "Why no, not exactly that, but they are not  j believers,"' said Mr. Bennett. 'Then you believe in infant damnation, I see." "No, by no means," said he, rather indignantly. "But does not Jesus say, ' He that believeth not, shall be damned[?' And you say that infants do not believe. If this is true, they must, of course, be damned."  "But they are incapable of Faith, and, there- fore, should they die in infancy they will be saved without it.1" "Well," said Mr. Truman, "if they can be saved without Faith, there is nothing to hinder their being Baptized without it. But, Brother Ben- nett, if your position is true, that infants do not, and cannot believe, should they die in infancy their damnation is inevitable, otherwise Jesus spake falsely. Now, as I do not believe in infant damnation, and ? t   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM. '     10 as I do believe that Jesus spake infallible truth,* when he used that language, I am  compelled -to reject your position. And I now assert that, in the eye of God, all hifants are regarded and treated, as believers." Mr. Bennett shook his head as expressing dissent. "Will the testimony of Jesus be authority with you-?" said Mr. Truman. "Certainly." Mr. Truman took the Bible, and turning to Matth. xvIII, 5, 6, read: "'Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth ine. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'" Mr. Judd repeated the words, 'which believe in me.' It was a new thought, and it came home with power to his mind.   There was the testimony of Jesus that infants were believers. Mr. Bennett was emphatically dumb.   What could he say?  Any attempted quibble would only make his objection contemptible. Mr. Titnman con, tinued: "Jesus not only asserts that little children do believe in Him, but He pronounces blessings upon those who receive them in His name."            "But how   can a little child believe? Christian.   108      THE JUDD FAMLY. ity is a system of doctrinal truths, so deep and prol.  found that the mind of a seraph can scarcely grasp them in their fulness," said Mr. Bennett. "How can-a little child, whose mind is yet in embryo, take any intelligent view of Christian truth?" "You. make Faith a speculation of the mind, which, of itself, is not saving. In that sense, the devils believe and tremble. The Apostle says:' 'With the heart, man believethll unto righteousness.' Saving faith is, therefore, an exercise of the heart,  rather than of the intellect. As Faith, in this sense, brings the soul into harmony with God, and changes its attitude from rebellion to that of filial obedience, X it becomes the synonym  of the condition of the soul at one with God. Such being the relation of the infant, till it goes into rebellion- of its own free choice, which it need not do, as all infants, are classed as believers." "But after all, I can't see it," said Mr. Bennett. "All infants are sinful, and need regeneration to fit them for heaven."         ' "Then you think that if the child dies without being regenerated, it will be lost, I see." "Oh, no!- In case of the death of an infant, I think God will regenerate it, and fit it for heaven." "( What, without Faith?" "Yes, of His own free grace." "If He can regenerate the heart of a dying in.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      109 fant, will you tell me what stands in the way of the regeneration of the living infant, Brother Ben- nett?" Mr. Bennett admitted that Mr. Truman's position was right. ' Now, Brother Bennett," said Mr. Truman, "since water Baptism is the symbol of the work of regeneration in the heart, according to your own theory, and since God is able to regenerate the heart of an infant, -as you say, without Faith, why may not an infant receive the sign, or symbol of the thing signified?" Mr. Bennett felt the force of this reasoning, and \  made no answer.  "The truth is," said Mr. -Truman, "there is      great mist thrown around this subject-the relation of the infant to the moral government of God. Justification by Faith, pre-supposes a condition of   i sin and rebellion. No child is a sinner till it ac-   tually sins. Till then, it is not condemned, and needs no forgiveness. If the child has not sinned, what is there to bar it from heaven?  If you say   i the child is representatively guilty in Adam, then it is representatively justified in Christ. His: aton- I ing work, according to the etymology of the Word, . brings the child into atonement with God,-and that  relation can be disturbed only by actual sin on the  part of the child."                  I * i   TtH JUDD FAMLY. Here Mr. Truman paused, to give Mr. Bennett the opportunity of a reply. "I see nothing wrong in your statement," said Mr. Bennett.  "There is a time in the life of every child com. ing t6 years of accountability, when it puts forth its first accountable act, and that act will be one of loving obedience to God, or of. sinful rebellion. Now, as 'love is the fulfilling of the law,' it follows that all true obedience must spring from love. That love must, therefore, preexist in the heart of the child as a condition of obedience. But love itself, is the outgrowth of a regenerate heart. One of two things must, therefore, be true, either the heart of-the infant must be regenerated, or sin is the natural result in default of it. The power, and the disposition to avoid sin are the result of Grace, and, therefore, show that grace exists in the child before it reaches the years of accountability, and thus the child is a believer." This was a new thought to Mr. Judd, and it carried with it a deepening sense of parental re- sponsibility.  True Christian love in the heart of parents, is a moral magnetic force, in its nature adapted to awaken love in the heart of the child. Christ formed in the heart of the parent, is the fountain and source of love; therefore Christ, as an indwelling Savior, becomes, through the parent, a   SCBRIEfTLtAL BAPTISM.   renewing regenerating power in the child.  Love beaming out in the eye, breathing forth in the voice, and awakening a jealous guardianship over the Spiritual well-being of the child. This is the golden chain that shall draw the child up to -God.  Oh! how supremely beautiful and all-conquering is Love, It is essentially Divine." " What do you understand by receiving children in the name of Christ?" said Mr. Judd. "That is an important question, and I would like to have Brother Bennett answer it," said Mr. Truman. "I don't think it means to Baptize them, and take them into the Church," said Mr. Bennett. "And yet, Jesus declares them believers," said Mr. Truman. "How long must a child be a be- liever, before it is entitled to Baptism, and a home in the Church ?" "Why," rejoined Mr. Bennett, "if I really thought a child a believer, I should think it my duty to Baptize it immediately, and take it into the Church." "Just so," said Mr. Truman.  "Now as I have the testimony of the blessed Jesus that infants are believers; and since He assures me that if I receive them in His name, I receive Him, I think myself authorized to receive and Baptize them." Mr. Bennett remained silent, and Mr. Judd gave  THE JUDD FAMLY. his wife a half-quizzical look, the same as to say, There is truth in that, don't, you think so? Mr. Truman resumed:  "I would not, however, have Brother Bennett think that I rest the duty wholly, or even mainly, on that passage. The testimony for Infant Baptism is cumulative and even voluminous." "Then you think that to receive a child in the name of Christ, in the sense He meant to teach,is to Baptize and admit it into the Church?" said Mr. Judd.. "I certainly believe that it means to Baptize and recognize them  as members of the general Church, and as ill covenant relation to Christ as their Redeemer and Savior; not because they are  i at the time capable of understanding the nature of covenant obligations. But God undoubtedly regards them as His own children, and He would have us regard and treat them as such, and give them the sheltering care of His- house, that they may be trained up for Him.'  "So you believe in infant church membership,"' said Mr. Bennett. "In the sense I have just defined it, I most cer- tainly] do," said Mr. Truman. "How long will it take to have the Church filled with dead or unconverted members?" said Mr. Ben- nett.' "That is the result of Infant Baptism."   SCRIPTURAL -BAPTISM .     1 3 "Do you think that to be a neoessalry iesrult ? said Mr. Truman, I think it to be the natural consequence of In- fant Baptism," was his reply. "Do you think Methodist, Presbyterian, or Con- gregational Churches are more dead and formal than Baptist Churches?" "I cannot say that I do," rejoined Mr. Bennett. "And yet, you know    they all believe in, and practice Infant Baptism; but the consequences you apprehend do not follow. -The truth is, Mr. Ben- nett, your prejudices have blinded you to- the real facts in the case. 'We do not believe that either Infant or Adult Baptism  initiates into any visible Church organization. It only brings the person so- Baptized into a general covenant relation to the catholic, or general Church, and is an acknowledged covenant relation of the Baptized to Christ and His spiritual household. When, therefore, we put the seal of the covenant upon either adult or infant, we simply say that we regard them   as belonging to Christ, and they, by that act, enter into visible covenant relation to Him  as their Redeemer and Savior. And hence, also, in the case of our chil- dren, we pledge, in their name, and our own, to train them up for Him." "But, after all, I cannot see, what good it can do an infant to sprinkle a little water in its face." The Juda Family.      8-    THE JUDD PAMTTY.           interposed Mr. Bennett. "It certainly has no knowl. edge of what it is done for." "Will you please inform us what good it does to Baptize an adult? Does it wash away his sins, or confer any real holiness upon him ?" "Why, as to that," said Mr. Bennett, "the good is only a relative one. It is an act of obedience to God, and a solemn profession of Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." "But is there no higher end to be attained? Is Baptism, only a test of fealty to Christ?" "Certainly. As you say, it places us in visible covenant relation to Christ, and in endearing cov- enant relation to his people, and all the promises and restraints of that covenant bear upon us for our good." " That is beautiful, and as true as it is beautiful' said Mr. Truman. Then turning to Mr. Judd, he said, "Brother Bennett has answered his own ques. tion, by stating that the benefit of Baptism is only a relative good, a good not growing out of Bap- tism itself, but out of the covenant relation of which Baptism is the seal. The good it does the adultis precisely the good it does the infant.  It is the good of a Divine restraint from  sin, and of holy encouragement in the path of obedience-drawn from the consideration of the vows of God upon us.   It is, therefore, a good running through our entire pilgrimage." "That is all well, very well, for one old enough to understand covenant obligations, but what good can it do an unconscious babe ?" said Mr. Bennett. "Paul the Apostle anticipated a similar objection in regard to circumcision, and answers, ' iuch every way, and in the same strain, but in the language of another, I will answer, 'Much every way,' but chiefly in that it brings the Baptized infant into a visible covenant relation to its God, and into an acknowledged relationship to the General Church; and if the parents; and the minister, and the Church do their duty, in teaching the child in time to come, the design and meaning of that sacred ordi- nance, it will continue to exert a salutary influence in every period of its subsequent life; and it shall know and feel that its Redeemer, and the Church, and the minister, as well as its parents, loved it, when it was an unconscious babe; and that fact will be one important tie that shall bind it in ever- lasting love and obedience to God." Mr. Bennett saw, and felt the force of Mr. Tru. man's reasoning. He arose and walked to the win- dow, and looked out, evincing some agitation of mind, and then, turning around, he remarked: "If Baptized children were properly instructed, as they should be, I presume an argument, or mo-  "6      THE JUDD FAMTTILY. tive of restraint on the one hand, and of encourage". ment on the other, might be drawn from the fact1 of their Baptism, to secure their early obedience to God. But I have seen so many thoughtless parents,l: who, in presenting their children for Baptism, have i seemed only to rely on some mysterious grace to accompany the act for their salvation, who neither repent of their own sins nor teach their children to repent of theirs, that I have been thoroughly dis. gusted with the whole thing. Is not this a crying sin? And do you wonder that I am  opposed to Infant Baptism, when such facts are so frequently met with?" "Are we to judge of the wisdom  of a Gospel ordinance by the abuse of it in the hands of sinful, erring men?" said Mr. Truman. "Should we not  Gather look at the benefits it is capable of working out, and is designed to accomplish, when used ac- cording to the will of God? It is the duty of all parents, not only to give themselves, but their chbil- dren to God, and to use for themselves and their offspring, all the helps that Divine wisdom places at their disposal. The neglect of one branch of duty is no justlification for neglecting another. 'These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.'" "Well," said Mr. Bennett, "I shall waive that point with only one word. I have met with so0   SORIPTURAL BAPTISM.      ' many profane and openly wicked persons who lwere Baptized in infancy, that it seems to me a desecra- tion of the ordinance to apply it to. any till they -give evidence that they are Christians.: ' "And have you not seen those who were Bap- tized upon the profession of their Faith, .who, after- wards, set at naught their covenant' vows, and became openly wicked?" said Mr. Truman. "I have," -said Mr. Bennett. "Does their unfaithfulness make the truthh of-God of none effect? Would you deny Baptism to believ- ing men because some have proved :unfaithful .who have taken :its obligations .upon them?" ' Mr.. Bennett confessed  that Mr. Tiruman was right. The ease was a plain one. Mr. Truman then took up the Bible ;that lay on the center-table, and iturning to Matth. mI, 2, read: Repent ye, for the kingdom  of God L   at hand.' Then tunding to chapter vr, 33, he read: "'But seek ye first the kingdom of God 'and His righteousness2. Then addressing Mr. Bennett, he said:  Will you give us what you think to be the usus logqandi, ,or a fair exegesis of the phrases, 'h Ki. ngdao ,f Heaven, and the ' Kingdom   of od,' in these Epan sages?" Mr. Bennett replied, that in his opinion, the two phrases were expressive of the same thought or truth, and that thought was also expressed by Athe    "8      THE JUDD FAMLY. phrase, 'the Kingdom of Christ,' or 'the Kingdom of Grace,' embracing all who take Christ as their  King, and His Gospel as their law.        s "That is the view I take of it," said Mr. Tru.  man. "But is not the relation Christ sustains to His people as Lawgiver and King, a covenant re- lation, and is not Baptism the external seal of that covenant?"         ,     , Mr. Bennett answered in the affirmative. "That being the case, the -usus loquandi is the same wherever the phrases occur," said Mr. Tru- man. Then turning to Luke, xvllu, 15, 16, 17, he read: 'And they brought unto him  also infants, that he would touch them; but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whoso- ever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter therein.'" "Now," said Mr. Truman, "is it not evident from this passage, that children sustain the same relation to Christ that true' believers do-in fact, that they are regarded and treated as true believers by the Lord Jesus Christ?" "But it does not follow that they are to be Bap- tized," interposed Mr. Bennett., "Jesus only put His hands on them, and blessed them."   SCRIPT'URAL BAPTISM.     i9 "We have never contended that Jesus Baptized them--at least with water; but as all the acts of Jesus are full of moral significance, we contend that this was an instance in which He taught by action. And we also contend that the great lesson here taught is, that children should be regarded and - treated as members of the household of Faith, and that nothing which shall be for their right moral training shall be withheld. "Now if Baptism, by bringing the adult Chris- tian into visible covenant relation to Christ andHis Church, becomes a means of edification and holy -encouragement, then the same should be conferred upon the infant, and for the same reason. In fact, this passage, rightly understood, -is an explicit war- rant for Infant Baptism." To this argument Mr. Bennett made no reply,! and as the reader will see, there was no chance for one. The argument was conclusive, and here was a de facto warrant for Infant Baptism.  .   a0o      THE JUDD FAMTTT.  CHlAP'TER VII. T THE close of our last chapter, our two cler. ,; ical disputants were called to tea., The merits of the tea-table were discussed in an equally amiable spirit, and with the good cheer which the ample board of our friend Judd afforded they were, re- freshed in body, at least. Meanwhile, our host  feeling that if they had been partakers of his car- nal things, he and his good wife had, in turn, been partakers of their spiritual things. A class of facts new to Mr. and Mrs. Judd had been brought for- ward and discussed, and these discussions were giving shape to their convictions of duty, that in due time will bear appropriate fruit. Having supplied the wants of the outward man, the party returned again to the parlor to renew the discussion. Mr. Truman re-opened it by -saying, "Brother Bennett dropped one expression in the commencement of our discussion, from which I may have drawn a wrong inference. You said you could find no testimony for Inafnt Baptism in the New   SCRIPTU'BAL BAPTISM.      i2t Testament. Am I to infer that you rejeet testimony, from the Old Testament upon: this point, by this express mention of the neuw 9' Mr. Bennett replied: "'We believe it to bean ordinance of the New Testament, exclusively, be- cause in this alone, we have an, account of the organization of the Church of Christ." "Do you mean to say that God had no organ- ized Church in the world, till after the coming of Christ?" "I mean to say that there was no gospel Church till after the comini of Christ. The Old Testament reveals a Law dispensation.  The New Testament opens to us the Gospel dispensation. I believe the Old Testament to be a revelation of the Law, in- stead of the Gospel. It was a dispensation of types and shadows, and of cumbersome ordinantes that* were to be done away when Christ came.   It ceon- tained promises and prophecies of the coming Mes, Siah, but it was only when  Christ came that the true Churcho was, set up on earth.'" "Are the views you now express entertained by Baptist ministers and Churches generally?" inquired Mr. Truman. "Very generally, I think," he replied. "Then it seems that you believe there; was. no' Gospel Church, nor any preaching of 'the Gospel, til:after Christ came?"            ' ,    122      THE JUDD FAMLY. "That is my opinion,' said Mr. Bennett.    i "I regret to learn that you differ so widely from the Apostle Paul. He tells us (Gal. III, 8,) 'And the. Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospelj unto Abraham.' In the 6th verse it is said, Abra- ham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.' "Here," continued Mr. Truman, "we have the explicit statement that the Gospel was preached to Abraham, that he believed -it, and that this Faith  was accounted to him for righteousness. Paul gives utterance to the same sentiment in Rom. Iv, 9, 10, 'For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. How was it then reckoned, when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision: and he re- ceived the sign of circumcision, a seal of the right- eousness he had, yet being uncircumcised.' "In this language Paul asserts, not only that Abraham believed the Gospel, but that circumcision was to him a sign and seal of this Gospel faith." Mr. Truman paused for an answer from Mr. Bennett, but he made no reply. In the face of such testimony what could he say? Silence was his best answer. So Mr. Truman continued:  "I should be unwilling to do our Baptist breth-  ren any injustice, I love them for their many ex- * ' "    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      123 cellent qualities, and for their unflinching advocacy of the Truth, as they understand it. I do not- be- lieve they would intentionally pervert the Truth; but it has seemed to me that their position on this point is the result of special pleading, to avoid the: argument drawn from the example of Abraham in circumcising his children, in the application of it to the question of Infant Baptism." Mr. Truman resumed: "We have only to look at Paul's argument in the third chapter of Galatians, with some attention, to see that he makes the following points: "1. The Gospel was preached to ALraham by God himself, and Abraham believed it. "2. He entered into covenant with Abraham, to be a God unto him, and his seed after him; and that this was, therefore, a Gospel covenant. "3. That circumcision was given as a visible sign and sea!- of that covenant.: And "4. That the law dispensation, as you call it, was not given till four hundred: and thirty years afterward, and did not supercede nor abrogate this Gospel covenant; but was rdded, as an appendix, because of transgressions, till the seed (Christ) should come, whom Abraham's faith- embraced in the prom- ise, 'And -in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.,"' "Then you believe the visible Church was or* s   .        i      "   124.      THE JUDD. FAMMrY I ganized  in the family of Abraham?" said Mr.    / Bennett.  Precisely," rejoined Mr. Truman; "So far as, the Church can have a visible form, it began in the family of Abraham."' ' But did not God promise in that covenant to  I give ,'the land of Canaan to Abraham, and his seed i after him, for an everlasting possession.? Was it not, therefore, a covenant having respect to tem- poral blessings?"            . To this Air. Truman replied: "Does not Paul tell us that Igodliness is profitable to all things i having the promise of the life that now is, and also  of that which is to come?? Is it, therefore, any less  a Gospel of rich spiritual blessing, because it brings  with it temporal good?" Mr. Bennett saw the force of this reasoning, and I was silent, so Mr. Truman continued:S "Can it be that you have always taken so low   a view of the Abralhalic covenant, as to suppose it  had respect only to temporal blessings? What was j Canaan to Abraham as an inheritance, compared to the fact that God was to ' be a God unto him, and hias seedy after him,' in their generatioun?' "The descendants of Abraham were divided into   nations, as thes 'Ishmaelites, Edomites ad Jews;, but to none of them was the law given in the same-- sense:: as to Israel. Gods election of grace placed   SCaiPttrArL BAPTISM.      125 the Messiah in this branch of the Abrahamic family. It was God's design that Israel should be a pre. Christian nation. But mere nationality was not the end for which they were made a nation.   They were to be models of all manly virtues, and to re- -flect in their lives the beauty of the Lord. The Law was given to them as it is given to all men through them, because of transgressions, and it wOis to serve as a school-mnaster to bring themrto Christ. It could not, therefore, disannul the promise, or make it of none effect."'  "I believe several Eastein nations practice cir- cumcision," said Mr. Bennett. "Are they Gobd's covenant people on that account? Is it riot rather to them a badge of national' descent?" Mr. Truman replied: "What iimpoltant tiith of revelation has not been turned into a lie by the ignorance and wickedness of men? The question is not what men ignorantly suppose circumcision to be;t but rather, what God designed it to be-thie sign of the circumcision of the heart, and' the seal 'of a dcovenant of rich spiritual and temporal blessings.0" Mr. Bennett made no reply.  He had thus' far beeii worsted in every argument. H6 had been the attacling patty, but every strbke of his" weapon had  been turned- aside, and the Weapon iftself lay hiirm- less at the feet of hiis - antagonist.                        .*.    126      THEB JUDD FAMTTY.. CHAPTER VIII. THE STILL hour of evening had now arrived. The noise and bustle of the world was hushed to silence. The affairs of the household had been arranged, and  the large, old-fashioned lamp was shedding its mellow rays from the center-table in  the parlor. The air was calm and  balmy without,  but bordering on the cold, while the first filmy rays of the  moon were streaking the .eastern sky, as those of the sun were fading in the West., The hour was one well suited to serious and yet pleasant thought; and what theme  more suited to  such an hour than the one that points us to the / duties we  owe our children, in fitting them to act well their part in life, and to prepare them for that  higher, better life in heaven. Our two   clerical friends are again in the parlor; each esteeming himself the friend and champon- of Truth, and each worthy of honor, from a con scientious advocacy of what seemed the Truth from - their different stand-points. They were, indeed, '   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      127 pitted against each other upon the one theme of ; Baptism and its immediate correlations, but sympa- thized with each other in ten things, where they disagreed in one, and each was tenacious for the ! Truth.  The two gentlemen were well matched as to talent, though widely different in depth and style of thought; and if one carries the stronghold of the other in this bloodless strife, it is because he happens to have Truth on his side. Let us listen to their further debate, and judge which stands with the Truth. Mr. Truman commenced the discussion by say- ing: "Brother Bennett has failed to show  that Infant Baptism contravenes any fundamental doc- trine of the Gospel, or any revealed principle of order in the Church of God; or, that it is any- where forbidden in the Scriptures. "I now propose to show that it is in harmony with a great fundamental principle, running through  i the entire current of revelation; that, in accordance with this principle, children were once coupled with their parents in covenant obligations and promises; that that covenant is neither abrogated nor changed, but is in full force to-day, and that it is none other than the Gospel covenant. "I shall attempt to show that, from the days of Abraham till the present hour, children have been   i Y   THE JUDD FAMiT,.        M regarded and treated as subject to covenant re. straints and promises, equally with their parents and the seal of the covenant placed upon them. "And lastly, that this principle, fully understood and faithfully carried out, in its true spirit and in. tent, will materially aid in the great work of bring. ing the world to Christ." A smile passed over the features of Mr. Bennett, but it was the smile of incredulity, while he re. marked: "I am inclined to think you are attempt. ing more than you can perform." "I doubt not you think so," said Mr. Truman. "'Let not him that putteth on the harness boast, as he that putteth it off,"' significantly retorted Mr. Bennett. "I have traveled this way before, and under. stand the lay of the land," said Mr. Truman, with a quiet smile, "and I intend to redeem my promise." "Well, you have laid a pretty broad foundation, and I fear it will take you sometime to build your mir-astle," again significantly hinted Mr. Bennett. ;'I doubt if I shall have patience to follow you ;hrough your arguments, as I don't wish to be up ate to-night." "Do you see that?" said Mr. Truman, pointing o the newly-risen moon. "I see it." "At what hour do you propose to adjourn?"   SCRIPTtUBAL BAPTISM.          12-9 "As early as half-past eight, at least." "Well," said Mr. Truman, "I will agree to finish my argument by that time, and I wish you to stay, and see that my logic and my Scriptures agree." Whenever, from any cause, a subject is distaste- ful to a person, the mind takes no interest in its investigation, but is rather disposed to shun it. In that case it can be held to an investigation only from motives of self, or party interest, or from  an intelligent conscientiousness of duty. In Mr. Bennett's case, as it too often happens, the subject of Baptism, in its various aspects, had not been investigated till after his party attachments had been formed. His views, on that subject, had been moulded by an insidious prejudice, silently in- wrought upon the mind by religious association with those, who had, in like manner, been influenced by shallow arguments, addressed more to the prejudice and partyism of the man than to his solid judgment. His opinions had, moreover, been of such long standing, and his thoughts on this subject had run so long in given channels, that it was difficult for him to look at it from any other stand-point than the one he had so long occupied.  Had he, there- fore, yielded to his impulses, he would have left without listening firther to the argument of Mr.   130      THRE JUDD FAMLY. Truman. But his hope, yet to draw Mr. Judd into  i his Church, determined him to stay.         "Brother Bennett objects to Infant Baptism, on the ground that there is no expressed command in the New Testament to Bbaptize them. Now, if this  objection is well founded, it is a serious one, at first sight; but the oljection will vanish when the real  facts of the case are duly considered. "It is a well established principle in civil gov. ernment, that a law, enacted in any commonwealth, must remain in force till repealed by the authority that formed it. This is a common sense principle, A and fundamental to government itself. Now, if I  prove that infants were once made members of the  Church of God, and the seal of the Co9venant placed  upon them by His express command, He being the law-giver, that law must be in force till repealed by A Himself.  "In this case, the silence of the New Testa-   ment is no objection, provided the law is clearly  stated in the Old Testament, and is not repealed in  the New. Is not this a logical and just conclusion?"- said Mr. Truman.   Mr. Bennett admitted that it was. I "Now for the proof," said Mr. Truman. "The first fact that I shall bring" forward, and one I con- sider of importance in this connection, is this: That I the true Church of God is one and the same in all   - X  SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      131' ages; that the Christian Church is but a continn- ation of the Abrahamic, or Jewish Churlch; both  being embraced in one covenant, both resting on the same great truths, and both having one mission. "I. The Christian Church is that which was taken from the Jews, and given to the Gentiles, according to the testimony of Christ himself, as re- corded in Matth. xxI, 43: 'Therefore say I unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.' I need only remark upon this passage, that by the phrase Kingdom of God,' we are to understand the Kingdom of Christ, which is His Church, accord- ing to Brother Bennett's exegesis of the term. "2. The Abrahamic Church is that from wioh the Jews, .as the natural branches, were broken through unbelief, and into which the Gentiles were grafted by Faith, according to the statement of the Apostle Paul in Rom. xi, 16 to 24 : "or if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches; but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.  Well because of un-   182      THE JUDD FAMLY  belief they were broken off, and thou standest by, faith. Be not high-minded, but fear. For if G(od spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He, spare not thee. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to' graff them in again.' "What can be plainer, or more to the point, than this language of the Apostle? The good olive tree is the symbol of the true Church. Abraham is the root. He was holy in the sense of standing in visible covenants'elation to God. If he as the root was' holy, then the tree (the Church as a whole) is- also holy, because it stands: in the same covenant relation to God as did Abraham.  It is into this, same Church, with its covenant blessings, that the believing Gentiles-are grafted, and, finally, it is into this same Church that the Jews are to be giafted, when by faith they turn to .their own Messiah-the   Lord Jesus." Mr. Truman continued : "It was the Abrabhamic Church, With its covenants of promise, that Paul I styles the (commonwealth of Israel,' Eph. II, 12, and' of which he speaks in the 19th verse: ' Now, there-, fore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but  fellow-citizens with the saints, and o0f the household  of God/ ' The believing Jews inherited this common- wealth, by Faith, and were not broken off firom it,   e   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     183 . as in the figure of the olive tree, and the believingi Gentiles become fellow citizens with them. "This is that mystery of Christ,' of which Paul also speaks in the 4th verse of the third chapter of- Ephesians, and of which he says in the 6th verse: 'That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and, of the same body (not another), and partakers. of hisg promise in Christ by the Gospel.' "There,"' said Mr. Truman, "the argument comes- to a point. It is not possible for testimony to be' more full and explicit to prove the identity of the Jewish and Christian Church." Mr. Truman then arose and6 walked across the room a few times for exercise. Then addressing Mr. Bennett, he said, "What have you to say to- that?" "Oh, nothing," replied that gentleman. "You have made your argument pretty strong--stronger than I thought you could,- and it would not be' wise, for me to attempt to wrestle with it." "So far, so good," said Mr. Truman. "It seems that Brother Bennett can find no fault with the fdcts,: or logic of my argument, and one fact stands proved --that the Jewish and Christian Churches, are one- and the same. Now  since children were made members of the Atr-ahamic Church, and the seal} of the covenant, which was then circumcision, placed upon them, it follows that they should still be iem- s              . Y   134      THE JUDD FAMLY, bers, and the seal of the same Church placed upon h them."  Mr. Judd nodded his assent to this statement of Mr. Truman.  (' In a former part of our discussion," said Mr.  Truman, "Brother Bennett expressed the opinion  * that the Abrahamic covenant referred ollly to tem j poral blessings, I then briefly proved, as I think,  that it was a covenant of Spiritual blessings though including temporal good. I wish now to refer to it again, to remove, if it is possible, any lingering doubt on that subject, and to present further tes- timony on that question. I again repeat: The Abra- hamic covenant requilred nothing less than true re- ligion. In proof of this I will refer you to Gen.  XVII, ."                      As Mr. Judd was sitting near the center-table, he took the Bible End read: "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed   after thee in their generations; for an everlasting  covenant to be a God unto thee, and thy seed    after thee." "What higher good can any soul enjoy, than to have God for their God?" said Mr. Truman J "Sutrely," said Mr. Judd, "that is the essence of all true religion." "Will Brother Judd please read Exod. xIx, 5, 6?" Mr. Judd turned to the passage and read: "Now,   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      135 therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." Let us now compare this passage with Deut. x, 12 to 16,X' said Mr. Truman. Mr. Judd read as follows: "And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to fear the Ljord thy God; to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord -thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul." Mr. Judd closed the Bible, and gave Mr. Ben- nett a penetrating look, as if to read his thoughts. He finally remarked: "What can Elder Bennevt say to these passages of Scripture? Can anything be clearer, that the Abrahamic covenant required nothing less than true religion?" "That may all be very true," said Mr. Bennett, "but is this not all Law? It points out duty, but it has no Christ in it, and it offers no pardon to penitent sinners.' "I am really surprised to hear you give utter- ance to such an idea," said Mr. Truman. "When God proclaimed himself to Moses in Mount Sinai at the time of giving the law, did he not, in that wonderful revelation of himself, and of the great fundamental principles of his moral government,   136      THER JUDa FA' -TY y.  declare himself 'Merciful and gracious, forgiving in. iquity, transgression, and sin?' Aud then, too, when God preached the Gospel to Abraham, did he not say, 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth I be blessed?' Was there no Christ in all this-no  j pardon for penitent sinners? Why, surely you are beside yourself to entertain such a thought." Mr. Bennett blushed, but miade no reply. Mr. Truman continuedl: "'Since Christ is the seed of Abraham, in which the nations, as sinners, are to be blessed, it is clear that the proclamation [ of this promise carries with it the offer of pardon, through the coining Messiah, and was, therefore, the Gospel, preached to Abrahlam and all his descend.  ants. That promise is the only hope of a lost and ruined race. Yes, Brother Bennett, that was Gos- pel--preeminently THE Gospel." "That's so," said Mr. Judd, with a significant nod, indicating how  fully he endorsed the views expressed by Mr. Truman.              "The truth is, the Gospel and the Law flow- along together all through the Old and New  Tess  taments. And they mutually support each other; the Law prescribing the line of duty, and the Gos- pel offering encouragement, and presenting motives to holy effort. The  Gospel is shadowed forth in the sacrifices of the ceremonial law, and by them was. the Gospel preached from age to age.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTI SM.     1:.7 "The duties and promises of the Abrahamic covenant are reciprocal The Gospel does not-free us from the claims of the Law. 'If it did; it would be the minister of sin. On the other hand, it is a merciful provision to enable s to fulfill the Law. I do not see that your position, if true, would help you any; for all the duties of the Christian life are duties made obligatory by the Law, even Baptism includeal. Thle Abrahamic covenant, as we have seen, connected parents and children in its obliga- tions and promises. The duty to obligate them, by circlmcision, was not against Law, but .in accord- ance with its demands. It was a duty growing out of the parental relations the same in every age, and under every dispensation, varying only in the external form of the obligation,  "Then you think Baptism a law duty," said Mr. Bennett.  "All duties are law duties,"' he replied. This was a new thought to Mr. Bennett.  The fact is, he was like thousands, who float along with the theological currents that set in about them. He was neither an original, nor a deep thinker; and his mind seldom grasped fundamental principles; and, although he was a warm-hearted and genial man in his social raontis, he was not a close an- alytical reasoner. Mr. Truman resumed his argument:   138       THE JUDD FMrY.          I "It is a fundamental principle in the moralgov-  ernment of God, that children are linked with their parents ih duty and destiny. Parents are bound by the law of God to assume for their children what. ever pertains to their physioal, mental, and moral welfare. The parents stand in the place of God to their infant offspring; ,and the early responsibilities of the child are locked up in those of the parent, In a modified sense, their children. are a part of themselves. And hence, they should assume for them whatever their children will properly assume for themselves, when they come to years of account., ability. Their responsibility for their children covers all the ground of their children's responsibility for themselves in after life. Physically, they feed, they clothe, they train them. Mentally, they think for them, they teach, they educate them. Morally they are to discipline them, direct their conduct, and train them in the way they should go. In all these respects, parents are bound to do for their children  what their children would be bound to do for them- selves, if they were nowr capable of moral action." Mr. Truman paused, to give Mr. Bennett an op- portunity to enter his protest to these statements, if he thought them untrue, but he made no reply. "What does Brother Bennett say to these state- ments of parental obligation in behalf of their chil- dren?" said Mr. Truman, determined to draw him out, if possible.   "You've got me," said Mr. Bennett.  "Your statement is too plain, and too true for successful contradiction.' Mr. Judd nodded his assent. "But what would the child's duty now be, if it were morally accountable, and personally able to perform its duty?" inquired Mr. Truman, addressing Mr. Bennett. "Why, manifestly to consecrate its being and its powers to God," was the reply. "And to take upon itself the appropriate seal of consecration-that is, be Baptized," said Mr. Judd, supplementing Mr. Bennett's answer. "Exactly," said Mr. Truman. "But from whom is this consecration now due?" "I see it I I see it!" responded Mr. Judd, with emphasis. "That consecration is now due from the parents, with whom its moral agency is now lodged." "Just so," said Mr. Truman. "God demands this consecration. It is his due. And as God com- municates with the child through the medium of its parents, providing for its wants, physical, mental, and moral, so the return due Him  must go up through the same parental medium." This argument of Mr. Truman was so clearly stated, and was so in harmony with the general teachings of the Bible, that Mr. Bennett was silenced, and Mr. Judd completely carried with it. But Mr.   THE JUDD FAMLY. Truman was too deeply read in human nature, not to know that early prejudices and old prepossess. ions would rise up and struggle to displace the newly received truth. When such prejudices and prepossessions, with the arguments and reasonings on which they are based, have grown familiar, they ssgume the shape of settled convictions. While the new truths, and the arguments by which they are proven, not being familiar, are liable to vanish from the mind, like a pleasant dream, unless they are repeated in such a variety of forms, and inwrought upon the mind by such cogency of argument and amplitude of illustration, as will make it familiarto the :mind when it assumes the form of settled con. viction. With the view, therefore, to further illus. trate and confirm the duty of infant consecration, Mr. Truman resumed his -line of argument. "This law, by which the child's responsibility is locked up ,i that of the parent, during its earlier years, is universally recognized in all civil govern- ments, and is a familiar principle in common law. A common law, children are regarded as members of the body politic, on account of a natural xelat6on to their parents, while parents embody and repre- sent the rights and prerogatives of their children. It follows, therefore, that children are subject to civil. responsibilities without their own knowledge or consent, Deeds, eovenants and contracts include   heirs, and descend to them, charged with various liabilities and conditions, which children capnot set aside, except at their peril. ":Now, without such an arrangement, huxman society could not hold together, and the golden chain of order, and of law, would be broken. But this principle, so essential to the strength and in- tegrity of society, applies equally to the moral gov- ernment of God; for it is out of that government that the civil relation grows. "Should. we separate children from the civil relations of their parents, weakness and anarchy would ensue. Just so in the moral kingdom. Give to children a religious independence of their parents, and a vital principle in the moral economy of that kingdom is set aside, and this golden chain of strength and beauty is broken. "I will not carry this argument farther,' said Mr. Truman, "lest I weary you. 'But I would like to have Brother Bennett show my position to be false, if he thinks it is so." "There is a good deal of force in your reason- ing," said Mr. Bennett, "and I am not prepared to controvert it." "Is not this principle prominent in the Abra- hamic covenant?" "I cannot deny it. I think it is," was Mr. Ben-   "2  '    THE JUDD FAMLY. "Then I need not parade the evidence." "You will do me a ifavor, briefly to present it," said Mr. Judd. "! wI ant to see it just as it stands in the Bible. That is the Judge that ends the strife with me."  "You will find it in Gen. xvnII, 9, 12." - Mr. Judd took the Bible and read: "And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant, therefore, thou and thy seed after thee in their gen- erations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and Lou, and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your fore-skin, and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be cir- cumcised among you, every man chilu in your gen- erations.' "' Now," said Mr. Truman, "' by turning to chap- ter xxI, 4th verse, you will see how Abraham obeyed the command." Mr. Judd read:  "And Abraham  circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him." Thile distinctively religious char- acter of circumcision is finely set fobrth in Rom. II, 28. 29: "For he is not a Jdw, which is one outward- ly, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew which is one inward- ly, and circumcisioll is that of the heart, in the spirit       SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      143 and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God." Circumcision in the flesh was the outward and standing symbol of this circumcision of the heart; and was, therefore, the outward sym- bol and seal of rich spiritual blessings. It was the seal of a covenant proclaiming Christ as the hope of sinners.               ' "That was the true Christian covenant. Under the old symbolic and shadowy dispensation, circum- cision was the most appropriate seal.  It was a of'the daily sacrifices of slain viotims, as symbolic of the onie all avatilzg sacrifice of the 'Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.' But when that dispensation had answered its end, and bChrist, the great Anti-type, had come, and had nailed these ordinances to Hip cross, as worn out and obsolete, it was proper that circumcision should pass away with them, and a new and more appro-   priate al-one  a equally symbolic and expressive  should take its place."  "I see what you are coming at," said Mr. Ben-     , nett. ,You want to prove that Baptism takes the     - place of circumcision. That is the old argument, but I can't see any force in it.'  s          l "A truth is no less true because it is old," said w dr. Truman.   "But I see you are disposed to jump    s   "4      THE- JUFDD FAMLY. ,      .                   i the fact that Baptism takes the place of circumcis- ion, as to establish the truth of that great funda- mental principle in the moral goverhment of God,  i that parents and children are equally connected in ob igation" and privilege; and that it is, therefore, a fundamental law'of Christianity. The point is just here. This covenant of cgrace inade with Abraham, embraced his infant offspring, and placed the then existing seal of the covenant upon them. Circuum- eision is no longer the seal of that covenant. It is, therefore, without a seal, unless Baptism be that seal. Now when we look at Baptism, we find that it occupies the same platce, and answers the same end, in'the Christian Clurch, that circumcision did' in the Abrahamic or Jewish. "It is also evident that, whatever may be the seal attaching to the covenant of grace under any dispensation, belongs equally to parents and chil dren, This is the established law of the Kingdom   -the Church and this law must hold in force tilr it is repealed. Has this law been repealed When? Where? Can Brother Bennett tell?'" Mr.. Bennett made no reply, for he saw that th  argument wrfs unansiwerable. It is a plain law o4 the Kingdom, unrepealed, and unrepealable', because  fundamental in God's moral government. It follows as a consequentce according to thih'  t Law, that the seal of the New Dispensation-the    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      14  second edition of the Gospel covenant-should be applied to infants: as well as to adults; and as Bap- tism is now the acknowledged seal, it should be applied to them. This was the conclusion to which Mr. Truman's reasoning brought Mr. and Mrs. Judd. They saw, they felt, they acknowleodged its force. It had with them the power of a demonstration. I will briefly add here, that " the old argument" as Mr. Bennett called it, is evidently an old and important truth.. , "I have not yet brought out all the proof upon this subject,"' said M: Truman. "I told you at the commencement of'our discussionf that the proof on this subject was cumulative. I now  propose to- proceed a  step further, and prove that the Lord Jesus Christ was himself a  minister of the circuIm- cision, and that the real Baptism is Christian cir- * umcision. -Paul shall be my witness. He says, Rom. xv, 8: ' Now  I  say Jesus' Christ' was a 'min- ister of the circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.'" "What were the promises made unto the fathers?" said Mr. Judd, wishing to fully understand the' subject. "'I will be a  God unto thee and thy 'seed after thee, in : their generations;' and in thy seed sAall a t the .falies of the earth be blessed.; Christ i beingf- The Ju dd ra ly .

Take this fact in connection with Paul's statement in Col. II, 2. ' In whom also ye are circumcised with the cir. cumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of hrist. Buried  with him in baptism wherein lso ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God.' Here the Spiritual Baptism in whi 1 we are buried to the rudiments of He world and to the emotions of the selfish and sinful heart, and comne iuto that new life of love, is called the circumcision made without hands because it is spiritual and internal, and is the 'circurcision of (anft' To this agrees. the testimony -of JUSTIN MARTYR.  He was the earliest of the Christian writ- ears after the Apostles. He was a man of great learnipg, and reflects the general faith of his time, in regard toBaptism. In his Dialogue with TYHo, a Jew, he says: 'We also, who by him  (Christ) have access to God, have not received this carnal circumcision, -but the spiritual circumcisin, which Enoch, and those like him observed. And we have received it by baptism, by the m ercy of God, be. eaUso we are sinners, and it is enjoined upon all p. rsm to receive it in the same manner,'"   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.       147 "That is pretty strong testimony," said Mr. Judd, "What do you say to it, Brother Bennett?" ' I have nothing to say," was his reply, "I'm a listener now." "But if you see anything wrong in the argument you will object to it, won't you " said Mr. Judd. "Of course I will," said he, with a smile "Now," said Mr. Truman, "I wish to institute a comparison, or parody, to show the identity be- tween circumcision and Baptism, when internal and spiritual. 'or ne is not a Jew awhich For heis not a Christian is one outwardly, :nether Is s wheih 's one outeardly, neither that citrumcison which is out. is that atam wanelis outward ward in the flesh.

"This parallel is as beautiful, it seems to me, as it is true," said Mrs. Judd, who had listened With deep attention to the arguments as they passed if review. For though she had said but little, she had thought the more. "Brother Bennett," said Mr. Trumian,  does the Lord's Supper take the place of the Passover i" your opihiond", Really,'" said he, "I am  hardly prepared to   "8      TUIE .UDD FAMT;Y. express an opinion. but I am ilnclinea to think it does. What is your opinion about it?" "'Both were commemorative," said r. Truman "The Paschal Supper was a prophetic reminder of the Lamb to be slain' for the salvation of sinful men; and also, a standing token of God's love and care for-His people. When the Lord's Supper was instituted, it was at the close of the Paschal Sup" per, when 'Christ our passover' was to be slain. It was to be a standing memorial of Christ slain for us. It was henceforth to be done in remem- brance of the unselfish love of Christ, for a lost and perishing world; and to be remembered in such 'a way as to awaken in us the same unselfish love for lost man. It was, therefore, designed to serve the same end in the New Dispensation that the Passover did in the Old; to be an oft-recurring memorial of God's love for His people, and a stand- ing proof of the truth of Christianity." "Then it evidently takes the place of the Pas- "That is certainly so, if I am any judge," said Mr. Bennett. ," And so I think," Mrs. Judd responded. "But have you ever thought that as the Lord's -" ' ' ' ;   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      149 Supper is the Paschal Supper in a new form, so Bap- tism is but circumcision in a new form, or that Bap- tism is Christian circumcision, with the bloody part thrown out? - That, as circumcision was' the .seal of the Abrahamic covenant, during the Dispensation of types and shadows, so Baptism is equally the seal of the same covenant, under the New Dispensation, or what I call the second and improved edition of the Abrahamic covenant." "There certainly seems to be a striking parallel between the two," said Mr. Bennett. " But I never looked at it in that light before." "Here, then, these arguments come to a focus. Baptism takes the place of circumcision. The seal of the covenant belongs to infants equally with their parents-all based upon the explicit teachings of the Old and New Testaments." Here Mr. Truman paused. The argument was complete. It needed nothing more. Mr. Bennett sat apparently absorbed in deep thought, and we leave the reader to judge as, to the effect of this argument on his mind. Mr. Judd was so filled with the beauty and deep significance of Baptism in its high spiritual aims, that he could keep still no longer. Springing to his feet, he rushed up to Mr. Truman, and seizing his hand, he exclaimed: "I am satisfied, abundant,   10U      T'JiH JUmD FJAMaX!LY ly satisfied. I begin to see the truth of a statement you made in the pulpit a few Sabbaths since. "What was that?" said Mr. Truman, smilingat   Mr. Judd's earnestness. "You said the Bible was like a vast mine of metal, buried deeply in the earth, and that its rich- est ores could be obtained -only by digging, and the deeper we dug the richer would be the ore, and the purer the metal.'"

He did not think of the thousands of pious, learned, venerable men, who thought/and sympathized with. Mr. Truman. Men as anxious to know the truth as himself, and who had enjoyed equal and even superior facilities to himself for knowing the truth on this subject. As the reader will see, his objections had thus far been silenced, and his positions shown to be baseless-mere castles built in air. But the mind does not easily loose its hold upon long cherished  opinions, even though those opinions are the results  of prejudice and misconception. For the time be- ing they assume the shape and appearance of truth, and until the illusion is dissipated the mind holds on to them, as with the power of a death-grasp. It is true, the strong arguments of Truth may wrest it from its moorings, and emancipate it from its falsities; but this- is neither easily nor quickly done. The mind is disposed to fly back to its old centers of thought, and to revolve around them. This is onereasonwhy somany who have dropped into error in early life, -hold on to it with tenacity, and die under its illusions. Mr. Bennett's mind had so long revolved in given circles, that it had worn itself a path, out of which he seemed bewildered. The arguments of MDIr. Truman were too much for him.  He was   wsirunaeL, BPTISM.      153  silenced, but not convinced. Up to this point M. r Truman had driven him from his strongest positions, but all his objections had been answered, at least in set form. He had long been accustomed to re- gard Infant Baptism as a relic of popery, and to  this he still clung. So he said: "Brother Truman, vour process of reasoninX is  new to me and your arguments appear logicaland  Scriptural, but I cannot see the subject as you do. It seems to me there is a kink somewhere that I  don't get hold of. I can't escape the conviction,  that, after all, Infant Baptism is a relic of popery and has come up since Apostolic times. Whyis it there is no mention of it in the New Testament, if  the Apostles really Baptized children? What means  this wonderful silence? We have numerous accounts of the Baptism of adults, but no distinct account of the Baptism of infants."cono "I admit there is no mention of the Baptism of infants apart from their parents," said Mr. Truman.  "But I contend that the Baptism of households, E does, in the nature of the case, involve the Baptism of children We have the distinct mentionof four  cases of household Baptism: Lydia and her house   j hold, the Jailor and his household, Cornelius and his household, and the household of Stephanus."  There is no proof that there w ny child  that-hereWas rgoh-ikdna   i n these households," said Mr. Bennett.    1654      THaN JUDD FAMTMF. "But if ,there was, what then?" "They must have been Baptized." "Well, this shows the practice of household Baptism?" "Yes," said Mr. Bennett, "where the children are old enough to believe." "Well, now suppose there were no young chil- dren or infants in any of the four families mentioned, yet since it was the practice to Baptize households, the Apostles must have found infants in some of the families so Baptized, and in that case, accord- ing to your own showing, the   children were Baptized." "It is all an inference. No proof; and I insist. that the silence of the New Testament is against. it," said Mr. Bennett. '"MyI good sir, there is no mention of female communion in the New  Testament, nor the least allusion to: it. Is& this silence proof against it? I oelieve you admit the female portion of your Church to the- bcommunion*." Mr. Bennett admitted it was so. "In. this ease you, are inconsistent with yourself, for if the silence of the New Testament is proof aganst::TPffnt Baptism, it must be against female- communion." ", Bennett made, no. reply, for he foundhe was taken in his oQWn11 trapI.   SCRIPtUrAL AAPltsM.      l "This silence of the New Testament, instead of being an argument against Infant Baptism, is in reality, proof in its favor."  "How can that be?"Mr. Bennett inquire'd. "I will tell you," said Mr. Truman,. 'It is an undisputed fact that the Jews were exceedigly ten- acious of their religious privileges. Foragesithad been their custom to put the sealof the Covenant upon t hqir infant offspring. It was, therefore, mor, ally impossible that a new rule, cutting them off from covenant privileges, could have been adoptedi without, creating dissatisfaction and awaking con . troversy. Could such a state of things have existed, and not find record in the Acts of the Apostles? The Jewish converts had no objection to Baptism, because that had been practiced for ages in eod- nection with circumcision. They vere not only un. willing to give up circ mcision f or themstelves, but insisted& that the Gentiles:tooi should be circ umcised All this comes out in the course of te narrative, but no voice of murmur is heard that the childrent were: cut off from:' covenant privileges, and fr the sim ple reason that they were not cut. off." M  r. . Truman continued: "Butt thi s is not: alti Suppose, the,covenant of which circumcision w asthe seal wasi to be- abolished by the coming of hrist, and a: ne coven ant adwopteod i w ie ,ret too be, excluded W hat: ooursle? wosld-it be- neiedfl::   156       THE JUDD FAMLY. for the Apostles to adopt? Silence on their part would not be sufficient to effect the change. There would be but one way to accomplish it, and that was by an express command; for silence would have sanctioned the ancient usage." "That is a fact," said Mr. Judd, with an em- phatic nod. "I never thought of that before." '"What strengthens this conclusion," said Mr. Truman, is a fact not generally known, or if known, overlooked by many in their discussions on this subject. That fact is well established in Jewish his- tory-namely, that Baptism had always been in use in connection with circumcision; every female child being Baptized, and every male chid Baptized and circumcised. This was particularly trof the chil- dren of proselytes from the Gentiles, who were always connected with their parents in the rites, both of circumcision and Baptism. The mother- and her daughter were Baptized, and the father and sons were Baptized and circumcised, upon their reception into the Jewish Church."           "Was that so?" said Mr. Bennett, in surprise. "If we may credit the truth of the Rabbinical writings," said Mr.. Truman. "Well, that is new to mae," said Mr. Judd. "What is Christianity but a system of prose- lytism to the God of the Hebrew Church, with cir- cumcision and sacrificial offerings thrown off, as   SORIPTURAL BAPTISM.      157 inappropriate to the New Dispensation.  So the Paschal lamb was laid aside because' Christ our passover was slain for us.' But the bread and wine, the usual accompaniments of the Passover, were retained to answer the same end that the whole had done before. "Now, since this system of proselytism had been practiced for ages, gathering into the Jewish Church believing Gentiles and their offspring, it is clear that the custom would run on into the New Dis. pensation, unless prohibited by express command. "Go now, to the New    Testament, and search: from Matthew to Revelations, and you will find no single word  disapproving of, or- forbidding infant consecration.  But on the other hand, the language used by the Apostles, is just such as we would ex- pect from  men favoring the ancient practice. Thus Peter says, 'The promise is to you and your chil- dren (as Jews), and  to all that are afar of (as Gentiles).'" This was a new turn of the subject to Mr. Ben- nett. It had  never before been presented to hisa mind in that' iht, and  he was, therefore, unpre- pared for any 'eply.  Well, what about its being a  relic of popery? said Mr. Judd, for he felt a little quizzical. "This is one of Brother Bennett's objections."  "Yes, it is one of the objeotions I have always   1S8       tAjBE .4:UDD,! . ,wTTT urged, because -it has always seemed tome to- have much weight" '"What proof have yon to substantiate the. aharge?"

"'Do you believe Infant Baptism an innovation upon the foem of the rite' merely, or upon it's essen- tial princip'led?'" "Upon both," was Mr. BennettNs reply.

"Di 1i any one oppose it at an earlier date?', "I think not." "That is, no lone opposed it till it had been in universal practice for more than one hundred years." "We have no record of any opposition before Tertullian," said Mr. Bennett. "Did he oppose it on the ground of its being an innovation upon the form or principles of the rite?"' "No, he advised its delay, lest the Baptized should fall into sin, and lose the benefit of the rite," was Mr., Bennett's answer. "Don't you think he would have opposed it as an innovation, if he had really thought it to be such?" "Rleally, I should suppose he would have urged that as a plea, had he thought it to be an inno- vation." "Yet he did not." "Nou." "How soon after Turtullian's time did any one else oppose it?" "I believe there was no opposition to it till the rise of the Anabaptists in Germany--after the ref-- ormation under Luther." "Well, let us see," said Mr. Truman. "Two facts are apparent in the history of the early Church. "1. Christianity spread with, great rapidity into the remotest parts of the Roman Empire under the   i        SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      161 \labors of the Apostles and 'heir immediate suc- cessors. "2.

Infant Baptism was practiced as early as the second century, generally, if not universally. ," 2. That it met with no opposition for one hun- dred years after it became general, and then, not on the ground of its being an innovation, but for reasons growing out of the idea of Baptismal re, generation. "3. You think it to be an innovation upon the essential principles of the rite, and therefore, a fatal error. "Now, Brother Bennett, can you, dan any sen- sible man believe that an innovation upon the essen-; tial principles of so important a rite as Baptism could take place at an age so near the Apostles, become general, and yet meet with: no opposition, and create no controversy?

The idea is too preposterous to be entertained for a moment. Never, Brother Bennett, never! "But for the sake of getting a clearer view of the difficulties- in' the way of introducing so impor- tant an error as this must have been, supposing it to have been an error, let us suppose the constitu- tion and articles of Faith of all the Apostolic Churches to be the same, or similar with those of the Baptist Churches in our day. "Now let some zealous advocate of Infant Bap, tism try to introduce the practice. He would have the arguments of Church history against him, for suppose him to be the originator of the custom, he could have no precedent in its favor. He would be asked:: Did the Apostles practice it? No. Why then do you introduce this new custom? Are you wiser than the Apostles? Such would be the diffi- oulties he would- halve to encounter.

It comes, t+en, to a, moral demonstration, that Infant Baptism could not have had its; origin, in' impostture, or the invention of, men. It must, therefore, have come down to us, from Apostoli times, and with their approbation." Mr. Bennett remained silent. What could he say to such facts and reasoning? To Mr. Judd's mind it, was only adding testimony to testimony, and he, kept wondering why he had remained ignorant of these facts so long. "Ati what time do historians date the rise of the: papacy?"Mr. Truman inquired, addressing Mr: Bennett.  "About the middle of the sixth, century,' was i hls reply. "Exactly,'" said Mr. Truman. "But:it seemsL that Infant Baptism was in common practice foeret hundred, years before that time' by your own con-l fession. How then can'you call it a relic of popery?' Why not: call it a relic of Apostolicaln suerstition? pat would come as near the truth, as, the; other," "Not much popery, in that," said Mr, Judd. Mr. Truman continued.: 'It appears, from your own admissions, that Infant Baptism was, practice at a very early date, and in this you, are bore out by the history of those early ti'es. But you have begged what needs to be-proved. Youuassume tha,   164       THE JUDD FAMLY. Infant Baptism was introduced after the Apostolic age. But you have brought no single item of tes- timony to prove it; and for the best of reasons-- there is none to bring, while all the facts are in favor of the practice. "I shall now take the position that Infant Bap. tism has come down to us in unbroken succession from the days of the Apostles; and I intend to in- troduce unimpeachable testimony to prove it. The voice of Ecclesiastical history is not silent on 'this point. I shall appeal to the Fathers of the Church, so called--the prominent writers of the Church in the second, third, and fourth centuries." "What! the men who advocated Baptismal Re- generation?" said Mr. Bennett. "Yes sir, the same; and however much we may question their theological speculations, their trath- fulness, as historialis has never been called in qutes- tion. We shall ask them to state facts only, not what they believed. Their works from the writings of Justin Martyr to those of Augustine, are in our best libraries, and stand wholly above criticism in respect to their authority as historians. These Fath- ers wrote before popery had an existence, and they give us clear views of Infiant Baptism, as it stands historically related to the times of the Apostles."' Here Mr. Truman drew from his pocket a paper upon which he had transeribed suoh :of the testi-   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM,.     165 mony of the Fathers as he thought needful for the occasion. He then resumed: "I will first give a list of those early Christian writers, that you may see at about what time they lived and wrote. "JUSTIN MARTYR.-He was converted to Chris- tianity A. D., 132, and suffered martyrdom A. D. 167.. "RENuvs.-- Bishop or pastor of the Church at Lyons. He was born before the death of St. John, and was intimately acquainted with Polycarp, a disciple of St. John. e ORIGEN.--He was born 85 years after the death of St. John.  "AUGUSTINE and PELAGIus.-They lived con- temporaneously, a little more than 300 years after the Apostles. They were both learned and promi- nent men in the Church, but they differed widely on the question of native depravity. Augustine holding to the commonly received doctrine of infant depravity, and Pelagius opposing it. Augustine in his plea, asks: 'Why are infants baptized for the remission of sin, if they have no sin?' at the same time intimating to Pelagius that if he would be con- sistent with himself, his denial of original sin must draw after it the, denial of Infant Baptism. At length it was reported that Pelagius was so hereti- cal as to deny Infant Baptism. "The reply of Pelagius is striking and unequivo-   ;':      THBEE JUDD, FAMLY.        eal 'tBaptism;' says he, 'ought to be administered to infants with the same sacramental words. which are -usedin the case: of adult persons. Men slander me as ifI denied the sacrament of baptism to in. fants. I never heard of any, not even the most impious. heretic, who denied baptism to infants.' "Recollect, Brother Bennett, that Pelagius lived only a little over 300 years after the Apostles--a man of great learning, who never; heard of any who denied: Baptism to. infants.  "You will also see how   this historical fact is borne out in, the reply of Augustine to this confess. ion of Pelagius. 'Since they grant that infants must be baptized as not being able to, resist the; author. -iy of the whole Churclh, whicho was doubtless dz  live te by, or, ZLord and Beis Apostles, they must cosequently. grant that they stand in need of the benefit, of the mediator.' -'"Again. On, anoth-her;- ocoasion Augustine remarksi 'The custom   of oulr :ther Church in baptizing infantsi must;inot. bu disregarded, nor accounted need-les, nor believed to be.? anything else than, an ordinance delivered to us. from .thep Apostles.  Again hbe deolaresthat "'he never met with any Christin,  either of the; general Chureh, or of;- any. of the sects, nor- with any writer who owned the authority of the , Scriptures, who taught any other doctrine than that infants, are to be baptized for. the remission, of sin.'   "Passing nearer to the Apostolic age, we learn that in the year 253 a council of sixty-six bishops, or pastors, was held at Carthage, in Africa, at which the noted CY'PRXa presided as moderator. To this council FoIDUS, a country pastor, sent the question,: 'Whether in the baptism of infants it was necessary: to wait till the eighth day, as was the ancient cus- tom of circumcision, or whether they might be bap- tized at an earlier day?' "Two things may be noted here as established facts in the opinions of this council. One was that Baptism  took the place of circumcision; and the other that Infant Baptism was proper and right, if not necessary.   '            . "Passing up still nearer to the Apostolic age, we find CORixEN, who was born only 85 years after the death of St. John. He was a man of great learning, and: extensive travel; and was also favored& with a Christian ancestry and education. :He was, therefore, better prepared to know the truth of this matter than any other man of that time. In one, of his homilies he gives us this, historic fact: 'Thoe custome of baptizing infants was, derived from the Apostles.' Again, in his comment on Romans, boo  5th, he mnakes this explicit statement: 'For thi     . cause it was, that, the Church received an. order  from. the Apostles to, give baptism to infants? "Coming still nearer to the: Apostolic age, e    .   168   =   THE JUDD FAXbTTvY. find IRBNJeUS, who was born before the death of St. John, and one of the earliest writers after the Apostolic age. He expressly declares that 'the Church learned from the Apostles to baptize chil- dren.' In his book against heretics, he says: ' For he (Christ) came to save all persons by himself; all, I mean, who by him are regenerated unto God; infants and little ones, and children, and youths, and elder persons.'  By 'regenerated,'lDr. Wall shows that he evidently meant Baptized; as in the sen- tence, 'They are regenerated in the same way of regeneration in which we have been regenerated, for they have been washed with water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' "Here, Brother Bennett, was a man close up to the Apostolic times. He was a pupil, or student, under Polycarp, of Smyrna, who was himself also, a student and parishioner of the Apostle John; and he gives it as a fact that the Church learned from the Apostles to Baptize children. Could he be mis. taken?   Believe it if you can. ".We will nowr pass up to JUSTIN MARTYR, the earliest of the Christian writers. In his first Apol- ogy to the  Emperor Antonius Pius, he  observes: 'several persons among us of sixty and seventy years old, of both sexes, who were discipled to Christ. in their childhood, do remain uncorrupted.'   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      169 'Those at all acquainted with the writings of the Fathers, are not at a loss to understand what they meant by 'discipling to Christ.' It was the act of consecrating them to Christ in Baptism. "Here was a -maI writing just after the death of the Apostle John, who declares that there were persons then living faithful, who were discipled, or Baptized inr childhood; which, as an historic fact, carries the practice up into the Apostolic age. "This Apology is said to have been written about A. D. 140. Seventy years earlier would be about the- year 70, or twenty-six years before the Apostle John wrote the book of Revelations, and before he wrote either his Gospel, or Epistles. Therefore, according to Justin, the Apostle John lived and taught at the very time these children were Baptized, "Here we have men, living just after the days of the Apostles, men of great learning and extensive research, and who certainly had the means of know- ing; and they give it as an historic fact, that chil- dren were JBaptized twenty-six yearns before John wrote the .Book of Revelations, 'that the Church received an order from the Apostles to give baptism to infants,' that Infant Baptism was practiced by the whole Church, and that the authority to do so was delivered by our Lord and His Apostles, and   1TO      THES JUDD yAAILY. that -they never. heard of any, even the most impious heretic, who denied Baptism to infants. "Now, Brother Bennett, you, 0DI), if you will, treat these historic facts as fictions. You can turn your back upon the clear teachings of the Sacred Scriptures, and leave the lambs of the flock on the outside of the fold, exposed to the ravages of the wolves; but you must not blame me if I follow in the footsteps of the early flock by giving heed to the words of Augustine when he bays, ' The custom of the Church in baptizing infants must not be dis- regarded, nor be accounted needless, nor believed to te anything else than an ordinance delivered to us from the Apostles.'"  "Even so," said Mr. Judd, drawing a long breath, as though he had been so absorbed as to forget to breathe. "It shall not be disregarded by me, not accounted needless." At a former time, in the progress of Mr. Tru- man's argument, he had expressed himself as 'abun- dantly satisfied.' But now he was more than ever determined, himself and his family to follow in the footsteps of the ancient Church, and give to the neighborhood an example of household Baptism. "But you surely would not deprive your children of the privilege of choosing for themselves," said Mr. Bennett. This objection seemed to stagger Mr. Judd.   SCRIPTURAL BA:PTIS9.      1 is There was something in it so subtle and plausible he knew not what answer to make.  So he gave Mr. Truman an appealing look, who, noticing -his confusion, came to his assistance. "Was circumcision put off to adult years to en- able Abraham's children to choose for themselves?' Mr. Trumaon enquired., The snare was broken, and Mr. Judd felt re- lieved. "There is a subtle skepticism in that objection,"  continued Mr. Truman. "We might put it in an- other form. Why will you teach your children the truths of the Christian religion, and thus bias their minds and prepossess them in its favor? Why not leave them to themselves till grown up, and then let them choose for themselves? "Let us put' this question in the form of -a syllogism:  "If Infant Baptism is of Divine appointment, then it is our duty to Baptize our children. But Infant Baptism is of Divine apppointment, as we have clearly shown. Therefore, it is the duty of Christian parents to have their children Baptized, and consequently any dissatisfaction on their part is unreasonable and wrong. "I have but one additional remark to make on this subject,' said Mr. Truman, addressing Mr. and Mrs. Judd. "I am prepared' to say that no person   172       THE JUDD FAMLY. is ever dissatisfied ith his or her Baptism in in. fancy, who is afterward properly instructed as to the nature and design of the ordinance, and who has had any fair exegesis of those passages of Scripture bearing upon this subject. To cavil with the, ordinance in this case, would be as absurd as for a sinner to cavil with the conditions of salva. tion. What would you think to hear an unbeliever say: 'Because God demands repentance and faith, therefore I am deprived of the privilege 'of going to heaven in my own way?' "No, Brother Bennett, the difficulty does not lie in the ordinance itself, but in our ignorance and misapprehension of it. And this skeptecism in re. gard to Infant Baptism, I say it in all kindness to you, comes often through the officiousness of some who, under a mistaken idea of duty, Have stirred up this element of doubt and unbelief, where it would have never appeared but for such inter- ference.", The hour Mr.' Bennett had set to adjourn having come, the two ministers united with Mr. and Mrs. Judd in a season of worship, led by Mr. Truman. He prayed for the spirit of Love and Christian unity, for wisdom to guide, and an unselfish, uu. sectarian zeal for the spread of true spiritual religion and the salvation of sinners. The Divine Spirit was present, their hearts were melted into love, and    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      173 the two ministers parted with the kindest of feelings. These discussions had the effect to settle the question so thoroughly in the minds of Mr. and Mrs., Judd that they determined at once to go forward, as a family thd take upon themselves the seal of the covenant. Accordingly, on the next Sabbath- after these discussions, at the close of the morning service, they went forward, as narrated at the end of the fourth Chapter.   * 174     TEl[ JUDD FAMtIY. CElAPTEIR X. WIFTLY and silently the years pass away; and as they go, bear us on through scenes of labor, joy, and sorrow. But to the faithful Chris- tian, the flight of years brings no regrets. If they bring seasons of labor and trial, they bring also victory, and the working out in us those manly and Christian virtues that make us a blessing to others, and fit us for the enduring bliss of heaven. Such was the case with Mr. anid Mrs. Judd. It was ten years since they had avouched the Lord Jehovah as their God and portion, and had publicly consecrated themselves and their household to Him and His service, taking upon themselves the seal of the covenant-Baptism.   These had been to them years of trial, but also of religious improvement, of growth jn knowledge and grace. 1A   faithful dis- charge of the duties of to-day serves to make us stronger to bear the trials, and meet the responsi- bilities of to-morrow. With them  the point had been reached in which, adopting the language of   SORll'Uxr AL BAPTISM.    175 the Psalmist, they could say, 'My heart is fixed, 0 God, my heart is fixed.' They had settled down into that religious order and stability so desirable for the right training of their children. Nellie, their eldest daughter, was now a modest maiden of seven. teen. She was a loving, confiding girl, and was in the habit of telling her mother all her little secrets, and of going to her for counsel in every question of duty. It was now about a year since, by her own act, she had ratified the consecration her parents made of her to the service of her God and Savior, by a public profession of Faith. William, the next younger, had evinced such a desire for an education that his parents thought it their duty to encourage him in this bent of his inclination, and he was now at a boarding-school, preparing for college. It was about this time that the following episode occurred.              v "What book was that which I found you read- ing in your bed-room  this morning, and that you slipped under your apron as I opened the  door?'! said Mrs. Judd. Nellie blushed, and was evidently confised. "I fear it is something that Will do you no good -- something that your own conscience tells you is Oontraband, or why should you try'to hide it from your mother "  .   176      THE JUDD FAMLY. "Oh, it is a very good book, mother.  It is called THEODOSIA EARNEST; OR, THE HEROINE OF FAITH." "Why, that is a very pretty title for a book," said Mrs. Judd.  "But why should my daughter try to hide a very good book from her mother? Have I ever discouraged, or forbade your reading good books?" In this case Nelhe had fallen into the snare of the tempter. On the day previous, while on an er. rand at Mr. Wilmot's, Susan Wilmot had quietly handed her a copy of Theodosia, telling her it was a lovely book, and she would never regret reading it. "But," said Susan, 'don't let your parents know that you have it, because they will forbid your reading it, for it is opposed to their views of Baptism." Nellie's confusion was but for a moment Iler usual good sense gained the mastery, and she frankly confessed that she acted foolishy in yielding to Susan's suggestion. ," Will mother forgive me?" said Nellie, a tear starting in her eye. "Forgive you, Nellie! With all my heart, when. my dear -daughter is soready to confess her error, and I love you the more for it," said her mother, pressing a gentle kiss upon her forehead. Mrs. Judd stood gazing a moment into the calm,   1SCPRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     I 7i oofiding face of her daughter, with a feebig of matrohly pride and gratulation. Then, with a sort of mental abstraction, she repeated, "Theodosia, Heroine of Faith." "Why, Nellie, I would like to see the book myself." Nellie flew to her bed-room closet, and in a mo- ment returned with the book, in tiwo volumes,j and laid them in her mother's lap. Mrs. Judd took up the first volume, and sat sketching its openitg chap- ter, while Nellie stood watching the countenance of her mother  At length, closing the book, she said to Nellie: "Wouldd you like to read this book?"  "I would, if mother considers it a suitable book for me to read,' said Nellie. "Do you think you are prepared to detect the errors it may contain, or unravel the sophisms that may lie concealed in its pages?' Nelhe was about to say yes, when her good sense again came to her rescue, and instead of say- ing yes, as she was tempted to do, she answered) "I do not know," and then, after a monentfi re- flection, she added, "I do not think I am, for it treats upon questions I have never examined, and yet I confess my feelings were a good deal warped toward the views expressed by Theodosia."9 "Did you detect any fallacy or assumption -i reading, the firlst (chapt-er? The Judd Family.  12   818     -raisr JUD FAMLY Nellie confessed that she did not. "And yet," continued her mother, "the very first page contains a broad assumption. Theodosia is made to assume, as a- truth, the very thing that needs proving-that there is but one mode of Baptism. She is made to say of an act of immersion and emersion, 'If that was baptism, then we were not  baptized.' Here it is assumed that the mode is the essential thing. It is confounding the thing done, with the manner of doing it; and of driveling a solemn ordinance of the Gospel down to a mere ex- ternal action." "I see it," said Nellie. "But I had not thought of it before, Really, it is 'Substituting the 'shuck' for the nut itself" "And yet you would like to read the book, I suppose," said her mother. Nellie stood thinking a moment, and then an- swered, "I have a suggestion to make. It is this: I will read it aloud to you anid father, a chapter or two each evening, and that will enable him, or you to point out its errors and mistatements." 'To this her mother consented,  "When shall we begin?" said Nellie. "Let me see. To-night is our weekly prayer- meeting. To-morrow evening your father will want to look over the weekly 'Journal.' It will be safe to commence on Friday evening. Everything in its   SCRIPTURAL BAPTIS.      i 79 place, Nellie." So Friday evening was fixed upon to begin the reading of Theodosia. Two whole days to wait seemed a long time to Nellie, for her mind would dwell upon the scene of Theodosia kneeling in her room in earnest prayer and she felt anxious to know the final result of the story.                  .  The young and inexperienced mind is influenced more by the embellishments than by the solid facts of a story. Addresses to the sympathies and im- agination will often carry the mind, especially of the young and impressible, even against the solid arguments of Truth, when stated in a dry, didactic style. Nelhe was not an exception to this tendency. But such had been her religious education, that she held herself in subordination to the larger experience and more mature judgement of her parents. So she waited patiently for the appointed time. It came at last.                     1 fIRST EVEyNIN-GS G BVfi W.         i Mr. Judd had been informed of the agreement  . between Nellie and her mother, and had made his arrangements to listen to the reading of Theodosia.

He took it up and read "Theodosia Earnest The Heroine of Faith. In two volumes, Vol. I." "A pretty large work on such a subject," said he to himself. "Nellie," said he, as she returned to the parlor, can you have patience to wade through this work, both volumes?" "I guess so. Why, father?,' "Well, Nellie, it is just here; several years ago, and when you were quite small, my mind was very much exercised on this question, and I took speeial piins to look into it. I heard the best arguments ' Air. Bennett could bring in favor of immersion, and you coldput them  into a nutshell, and I'm in- clined to think- you'll have to go over a good deal   of ground to get a very little solid argument, and much less of Truth." I Mrs. Judd took her knitting-work, and seated herself in her- easy chair. Mr. Judd seated himself  in .a , alf-reolining posture on the settee, while, Nellie took her 'eat near the lamp and began to read. They listened patiently till she had finishedtheo st i   chapter.

"No sir, not then." "But Nellie, have you thought so since?" "I have." "When?" "When I first read this introductory chapter." "But what made you think so?" "I cannot tell, unless my sympathies were ex- cited by the tragedy of the story. There certainly was no argument, reasoning, or show of facts to make -me think so." ," Well, Nellie," said Mr. Judd, with a serious air, "you know that the subject of Baptism has scarcely been mentioned in our family, and Mr. Tru- man has not alluded to it in a controversial way in a number of years; and yet, with the little in- struction you have had, you didn't jump at any such conclusion as Theodosia is made to arrive at. I now see that I have failed to do my duty to you and the other children in this respect; and I fear I Mr. Truman too, has failed in not discussing this subject more frequently in his public ministrations. I presume it is with him as it is with me. The subject is so well defined in my mind that I have overlooked the fact that others might be disturbed, or in doubt on this question."  ",Well," said Mys. Judd, looking up from her   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      183 knitting, "I think Mr. Percy is a superficial and selfish man, endeavoring to create or confirm pre- judice against Presbyterians. Do you think that Christian kindness, Nellie?" "I think it very unchristian." Nellie read on in "The First Night's Study" till she came to the words, "I should even in that case, feel inclined to choose the same mode that He did, and which the early disciples did." "Stop Nellie," said Mr. Judd. "There is some- thing that needs reviewing.: Don't you see the nose of wax again? Theodosia has that worn out as- sumption that Christ and the early disciples were immersed, put into her mouth. That is the very thing that needs to be proved, but cannot be." Then with a serious, thoughtful air, he continued: 'I do dot not wish to dictate your Faith, Nellie; but I do wish you to examine facts for yourself, and thus be able to give a reason for the hope that is within you, instead of following cunningly de- vised fables." "But father," said Nellie, "was it not just as Theodosia says? Did not Christ go down into the water, and come up out of the water?" "Is going down into the water, or coming up out of it, Baptism? What boy or girl that has not been down into the water fifty times perhaps, and   184       THE JUDD FAMLILY. Many of thep immersed, too. Were they Baptized by so doing?" * Of course not, father." " Well, Nellie, does that text say how Jesus was Baptized when He was in the water?" "No. But is it not presumptive that He was immersed?" "What does John say about his Baptism, Matth. III, 2?" Nellie took her Bible and read, "I indeed bap tize you with water. He (Christ) shall baptize you with the- Holy Ghost and with fire." "There, Nellie, John has' answered your ques- tion. It was with water. He Baptized in. Jordan. That was the place where he Baptized, but the Bap- tism itself was owith water." "But could he not irmmerse with water?" said Nellie. She had hardly propounded the question when she burst into a laugh at the ludicrousness of the. thought. "It is presumptive that Baptism with water, and with the Holy Ghost are alike as to the mode or manner of admnitistration. lmmnersion must necssba- rily be in and rnot with.

And, Nellie, you will find, if you trouble yourself to examine, that imrmert sion is everywhere in :the Scriptures used as the symbol of distress and anguish, but never of that which is joyous and hopeful. "Now, Nellie," continued Mr. Judd, "please take your Bible, and read Acts I, 4." She read:  "And being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem; but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." t["How was this Baptism of the Holy Ghost per- formed?" enquired Nellie. "If you will turn to the second chapter of Acts, you will see." Nellie turned and read the first four verses. "Is this the fulfillment of the promise of the Father? " said she. "Read the. 16th and 17th verses, and see what they say." She read:   "But this is that hich was spoken by the Prophet Joel. And it shall come to pass in the last days, aaith God, IT will par out my  Spit u lpon: all jflesh. "Now daughter, read the 38d verse."               .   186      THE JUDD PFATT y. She read' "Therefore, being by the right hand of God, exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear." She closed the Bible and sat in deep thought for a moment, and then with a smile suffusing her face, she turned to her father. He caught a glance of her eye, ahd knew she was ready to give her verdict. "Well, Nellie, you have the testimony before you--what verdict do you render?" "I should judge that pouring out and shedding forth the spirit could not be an immersion, for the idea is plainly that of falling upon, as rain, and this is the manner of the Spiritual Baptism." Then, after a moment, she enquired, "Are these all the pas- sages of Scripture that refer to the Spiritual Bap- ,   tism?" "Oh, no!  They are more numerous than we have-time now to refer to, but we may, perhaps, have occasion to look at them as we read further on in Theod()sia. There are, however, two or three 'so appropriate to the interpretation you have just given that, if you wish, I will refer you to them." : "Do, father; I am so, anxious to compare all the Scriptures bearing upon this subject." "Then turn to Acts, v'I, 15, 16; x, 44, 46, and -xl, 15, 16."   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      187 She turned to those passages, and read them in order. "Who when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell ofn thenm, as on us at the begiznning." Mr. Judd remained silent. These words of the Sacred Historian were so plain as to the mode of the Spiritual Baptism, that they needed no com- ments to make them plainer; and he was willing to trust Nellie's good sense in the right understand- ing of them. Mrs. Judd made her needles, fairly snap, so ear- nestly did her fingers labor to keep pace with her thoughts. There sat Nellie, absorbed in' profound thought. It was a fine scene for a painter. "A  penny for your thoughts, Nellie," said Mr. Judd, amused at her deep abstraction. But her mind was too deeply engaged with the subject to notice his remark. "Nellie, my daughter," continued Mr. Judd, as 'Ij   188:      THE JUDD' FAMLY. she aroused from her deep reverie, "what think you of the subject now?" "I think that immersion is, out of the question, at, least in regard to the Spiritual Baptism; and if the weith means the same in both Baptisms, then John did not immerse those whom he Baptized." "That is my opinion, Nellie, and to my mind it is plain that the in is a note of place only, while with is a note of manner or mode." N].ellie resumed her reading. She read till she came to the following, passage: "' But Mr. Percy,' said Edwin, 'the Baptist preacher told Mr. Anxious the other day that bap ze and baptism  were not English words at all, but the Greek words baptizo and baptismos, transferred: into the English Bible, and not translated. He said that King James would not permit the translators to translate all the words, for fear of disturbing the faith and practice of the Church of England, and so they just kept the Greek word; bult if they had translated it at all, it must have been dip or immerse, instead of baptize.'" "i wonder if the writer of Theodosia thought people were all fools and ignorant, when he penned V th/at paragraph," said: Nellie, closing the book. 'It- seems, however, that he thought he was revealing some great secret in telling his readers that 'bap- tize' was a Greek word. As little as I know, I hi-ew tFiat a' great while ago. But- father, is it true   SCRIfTURAL BAPTISM.      189 that King James would not permit the word baptizo to be translated, for fear of disturbing the faith and' praotioe of the Church of England?" "I am sorry to say that charge is incoirekct," said Mr. Judd. "King James might live been :a much better man than he was; but this charge is ithout foundation, and it is simply' made for effect, to prejudice the ignorant and to prepare themni to receive as proof, the broad assumption he makes in regard to the meaning of the word baptizo. Nor is the assertion true, that if the word' was tranislia ted it must be rendered dip or immense.   The word is sometimes translated in the Bible is in Mark wr, 4: 'And when they come firom the: mari ket, except they wqash, they- eat not.' Mr. Trum&ait: pointed out that word to me in his Greek Testa- ment, and the word is baptizon ai, which he said was Baptize. He also said there was another Greek word for owash. I think he said it was o-tto. wash, one's person." He continued: "  I am sorry for a cause that has to be supported by a resort to0 such rmisrepresentation ns."  "And yet the writer is a professed Christian," said Nellie. And lifting her hands in deep emotion, she exclaimed: "Can it be -possible that Christa men can adopt such methods to gain proselytes to their opinions?"  "It is certain, Nellie, that a cause that can be   190      THES JUDD FAMTLY. supported only by misrepresentations of the motives and opinions of others cannot be a good one,". said Mr. Judd. "("But poor fallen human nature, with its strong bias to sin and partyism, often shows itself in those who really mean to be good men, but who are so blinded that they are not conscious of the motives that actuate them. Many really good men do not half know themselves. They are often much more under the influence of prejudice and partisan feelings than they are aware of. I presume the writer of Theodosia had in some way, got the impression that King James was actuated by such: a motive, and under the influence of pre- judice and partisan feeling, and without reflecting upon the moral bearings of the statement, he wrote as he did."  ' Nellie again opened the book and read on. She soon, came to the sentence purporting to come from e young Edwin, "'But, Mr. Percy, I have looked- up the words in My Greek Lexicon, and I find itjust as he said. Baptizo does mean immerse, and:,Bap- tismos does mean inmmersion.'"  "'Is that so, father?" said Nellie. "Read on further," said Mr. Judd, "I 'will an- ewer that after a-- while." She read on through the definitions of the word, till thew, iter says, "He (Mr. Percy) was astonished , .,   f       saBSmP'IOBF0L 'BPTISM.   191 The thought had never occurred to him before that Baptize was not an English word." "Hold on, Nellie," said Mr. Judd. "That is rather too much. Just see the inconsistency. Only a page or so back Mr. Percy is made to take a very intelligent view of the meaning of the word Bap- tize, when he calls it a generic, rather than a specific term, meaning more the result of an act than the act itself, when applied to Baptism as a religious act. And then, too, Mr. Percy is represented as a Greek scholar, enough so to read Greek; and yet he is astonished to find out that Baptizo is a Greek word. Just think of it, Nellie. Here is a Greek scholar who does not know that Baptizo is Greek. Why, the thing is perfectly preposterous! "Now I don't know how it, strikes your mind, Nellie, but it appears to me that this is a bluster.- ing paragraph addressed to the credulity of the ignorant," "I view it very much in, that light," said she, and-Mrs. Judd gave a very significant nod to ex- press her assent. Mr. Judd continued: "In regard to the mean- ing of the word Baptizo, I am not a Greek scholar. I can't tell one Greek letter from another,;but some'  years ago your mother and myself visited at Mr.: Atkinson's with Mr. Bennett, Mr. and Mrs. Alvord, and some others, and that good man, Mr. Nixon,   W13.2   TRA JUVDD .FAMLY. , :the: Colporteur, who -has been at, our house several times since,'happened to be there. It was: he first time I ever saw him, but I shall never forget the dis- eussion we had on this subject of Baptism. I recol- lect that when Mr. Bennett had been driven to the wall in every other argument, he fell back upon the meaning of the word Baptizo. It was his last plank,: and your mother remembers how handsomely the Colporteur shoved him off from that last standing place." "I shall never forget that discussion as long as I liv'l said Mrs. Judd. "I never got so much light on any subject in all my life before." "Did the Colporteur admit that Baptizo means immerse?" inquired Nellie. "He admitted that to be one of its definitions and only one of many." "What other meaning did he say it had?" "I cannot think of all the definitions he gave it," said Mr. Judd, but I remember he said it meant to wet, to moisten, to cleanse, to wash, and he said it also meant to color, to stain, to dye. But I recol- lect one of his, arguments in reference to the mean- i'ag of the word in p rticular, and I thought then, : ash still think there was a good deal of truth in it. He -saia we were not to judge of the 'meaning of th e word by the use, the heathen Greeks mae4 oi  4 bat rather by the use that Christ and His Apowr   SCRIPTURAL- BAPTI .  l-  ties made of it. For the Greeks, being heathen idolaters, had no knowledge of the truths of revealed religion, and so had no words to express, them; but when the .Greek language came to be spoken by the Jews, they attached a new meaning to a good many words, and among them the word Baptizo." * "That reminds me of what Mr. Truman said last Sabbath in the Bible class," said. Nellie. "We'  were discussing the passage in John nm, 5, 'Vetr ily! verily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,* and. Mr. Truman related an anecdote that he got from his friend, Rev. Mr. Hall, and he prefaced the anecdote by saying ' The old Greek of the Grecians is called classic Greek, while the Greek .of the New Testament is called the Greek of the Synagogue. Any man, he said, fwho is both a classical and. biblical student -knows full well that a Greek Lexicon of the Greek of the Syn- agogue must be peculiarly a- Lexion of the -New, Testament Greek. And such we have-elaborate, and excellent lexicon. But if we read the classic Greek by these, we shall make nonsense; and if we read the New Testament altogether by the classic lexicons, we shall also, make arrant inonse.' Mr. Truman then related the aneedote w-hich, asnearly as I can recollect, is this: Some- years, sia'e, fMr., Hall met with a man who was liberally educated-- a thorough sceholar-an: able lawyer, and possessed The Judd Fathr   13   194      THE JUDD FAMPY. of splendid natural abilities, but skeptical in his views, of religion. With this man Mr. Hall under- took to reason about the necessity of being born of the Holy, Ghost. Now the word in the Greek Tes. tament for ghost or spirit is pneuma, which origin. ally, and in classic Greek means wind or air. 'This man,' said Mr. Hall, 'would have me argue by the book, and he turned me to the Greek Testament. See here, says he, it reads-and you know it reads- Except a man be born of WATER and of WIND. What right have you to change the original classic meaning of pneuman (wind) here, any more than you have of hudatos (water)? And see further, said he, there is the same word in the 8th verse, letter for letter, and there you do not say the spirit bloweth, but you say the wind bloweth.  He was right in the original classic use of the word,' said Mr] Hall, 'and if I had argued on the principles on which our Baptist brethren have argued, I should have been obliged to allow that the renewing by the Spirit of God, or even the personal existence of suCHi a Spirit, is not taught, or referred to in this passage."' "Mr. Truman's anecdote was just in point, on, the meaning of the word Baptize, and the writer of Theodosia reasons just as did the skeptical lawyer," said Mr. Juddi ., Nellie then read on to the close of the "First    SCEIPTnURAL BAPTISM.     195 Night's Study." As she closed the book, she gave her father an enquiring look, as much as to say, What do you think of the balance? Mr. Judd at once comprehended her wish, and replied: "Whea Miss Theodosia turns away from the lexicons to the 'teachings and example of Christ,' she comes as near to the true point as she can, and not hit it. She supposes that some specified exter- nal act is required. She says: 'Now in HS BAP- TISM a certain act was performed. It may have been sprinkling, pouring, or dipping, but whatever it was, that act is what He meant by Baptism.' Hold on, Theodosia, don't be quite so positive. That is the very thing that needs proving; and that is the very thing we deny.  We contend that He did not mean any specified external act, but some- thing almost infinitely above any external act. It is the soul entering into covenant with God. This is the result, and if this result is reached by either sprinkling, pouring, or immersion, then  each or either of them is a valid .means to that end, and the advisable mode, in any given case, depends upon circumstances outside of the modeitself." "But father;" said Nellie, "Christ must have I been Baptized in some mode, and that must have been the right one, whichever it was." "Your statement is true, my  daughter, to a oer-   1 96      THE JUDD FAMtLY. tain extent. If we could ascertain precisely what that mode was, then that mode would certainly be a Scriptural one, and -in all similar circumstanees the advisable mode. But. Nellie, it will not do to jump at conclusions as Theodosia does. The mode in which Christ was Baptized is wholly a matter of i'ference, and no one can know positively whether his inferenee is the right one. The fact is, Nellie, the mode would not have been left to mere infer, enee- if it had been essential to valid Baptism.;"   a- IPTU-AL BAPTs.       197 ' * CHAPTER XLI UST as Mr. Judd closed the last sentence of the previous chapter, the clock struck eight, (";I declare," said he, "I thought it was later. We have yet one hour to bed-time. If you are not too much fatigued, I think you had better read the next chapter yet this evening.  Perhaps the book will improve as we get into it." "I am not tired a bit," said Nellie. So she re- sumed the, reading in a clear and distinct tone, while Mr. Judd noted each statement as it came 'along. It took her nearly an hour, and as she had read almost without stopping, she was somewhat fatigued. "I should think you would be exhausted' after reading such an extensive display of wisdom,'* said Mr. Judd. "Here is a great bluster about the pedio- Baptist authorities, and a parading of the ass umed opinions of learned men. But Nellie, there is evi- dently a snare of some kind in this skein, Ths 0isie Mr. Courtney, aid thei youthful hrioin-e of iir- /  if   1'08     -' THsEB JUDD 'FAMLY. sion, Miss Theodosia, are made to serve the great theologians, McKnight, Calvin, Wesley, Chalmers, Stuart, and Barnes, just as they do the lexicons, suppressing half their testimony, and, by so doing, pervert the balance. By such methods you can prove anything you wish." "That reminds me of the anecdote of the boy who said he could prove that stealing was com- manded in the Bible," said Mrs. Judd. "His father demanded the proof, when he quoted:  'Let him that stole steal,' and when requested to quote the balance, declined, saying he had quoted enough to answer his purpose. Those little words ' no more' would have spoiled his argument." "I should judge your anecdote to be just in point," said Nellie, laughing. "But since father says the testimony of the Greek theologians is per- verted, I would like to have him explain the matter." '"Well, Nellie, in compliance with your request, I have to say:  "I. That ' Pastor Johnson' is simply a man of straw, set up to be beaten down. He is made to present just such arguments as the author of Theo- dosia is pleased to put into his mouth; ,and he uses them just to suit the author. No wonder victories can be won under such circumstances. But if the author of Theodosia should measure weapons with    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      199 any live Presbyterian one remove above idiocy, he would hardly gain a victory. "2. As to the pedo-Baptist authors quoted, Me Knight, Wesley, and others, their opinions, if they have been fully and truly quoted, were only the opinions of men, and of themselves no proof. But Nellie, it is too late to-night to give you the facts in regard to the opinions of those authors. To- morrow evening, after listening to the next chapter, it may be proper to give you a few facts in regard to them." On the following evening, after the affairs of the household were properly arranged, they again repaired to the parlor to listen to the reading of Theodosia. Nellie again took her seat near the lamp, Mr. Judd his reclining posture on the settee, and Mrs. Judd again took possession of her easy -chair and resumed her knitting.  Nellie read slowly and distinctly every word of the "Third Night's Study."5 Mr. Judd was often tempted to arrest the reading with comments, but he etainzed silent till she closed. He was then about to point out some of its absurdities, when Nellie interposed: "I don't care about reading any more of this book.)" "Why," rejoined Mr. Judd, " don't you think it a finely contrived story?"   -200      THE JUDD FAMTIY. "The story is well enough, if it Was only true to fact. But it is so unfair, and so unchristian, I hardly think it my duty to spend any further time with it." "But Nellie, there are thousands who will read Theodosia with absorbing interest, and with gush. ing sympathies fol the persecuted Miss Theodosia, who will have their minds filled with a deep, bitter! prejudice against Presbyterians."' "'It is for that very reason that I don't core about reading further," said Nellie. "For I don't wish knowingly to keep company  with slanderers. And, judging the balance of the book by that part I have already read, I amust call it an oily slander." Mr. Judd could but inwardly approve of his daughter's good sense' and- Christian indignation. The book is evidently a cunningly devised fable, 'and the pretended Miss Theodosia, instead of being the Heroine of Faith, is but the dupe of a phantom. And then too, the tendency of the work is to feed the fires of sectarianism and engender prejudice against all who do not practice immersion exclusively. And what is the object of the book? Evidently to make proselytes to an opinion, and so to a branch of the general Church whose distinctive policy is based upon that opinion.  And all this waste of time and labor is to give prominence to a mere ex- ternal act-an act having no moral character of    'r   ScIRPTURAL BAPTISM.      201 itself, and giving none, and knowing only the rally- ing cry of a party. o Mr. Judd, however, was willing she should read it, if by the law of revolution, it should lead her to a broader Christian charity, and to depend less upon forms and ceremonies. "But what of the arguments in this chapter?" said Mr. Judd, wishing to draw her out. "As to the arguments," rejoined Nellie, "you are better prepared to judge of them than I am. But when the cry of wolf is raised just as the ar- gument of an opponent is being stated, I confess it looks like diverting attention from the real merits of the question." "Very true, Nellie," said Mr. Judd  "I: have long observed that they who cry wolf the- loudest, generally do it to cover up, and divert attention from some wolfish design. Thus when Mr. Court- ney says, 'Is it possible that a minister of Jesus Christ can take :such liberties with the Word of rod,' what is it but the cry of wolf, to frighted people from the only real argument that Pastor Johnson is permitted to make? "Now, Nellie," continueed Mr. Judd,' "before we dismiss this book, I wish to call your attention. to one or two things, because I deem  it important that you should be posted in regard to soMie histoAe facts, bearing upon- the points discussed in this Work..   202       THE JUDD FAMLY. "It is a well known fact that many of the the ologians of the past two hundred years, and es. pecially -those of the Church of England, have paid great deference to the opinions of the early Fathers of the Church-those who lived -in the second, third, and fourth centuries. It is also a fact, well authen. ticated, that dipping, or a partial submersion of the body in Baptism, was commonly, though not always, practiced in those days. These partial, and some- times total immersions" were practiced, not because they were deemed essential to valid Baptism, but because they were thought more impressive, which, -by the way, is a matter of taste; for in the case of the sick, or of persons in feeble and declining health, it was administered by affusion, or sprinkling. "It was these facts -before the minds of these theologians that led them to suppose that dipping, -or immersion was, or might have been the practice in Apostolic times, and that opinion guided them in their expositions of those portions of Scripture referring,to Baptism. They did not believe the mode essential because the early Fathers did not. "You' will notice, Nellie, that the author of Theodosia is careful to keep these facts concealed, because they would spoil his story. And then with :these facts concealed, he puts into the mouth of his youthful heroine the expression that, ' these the- ologians are strange, mysterious, and inconsistent   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      203 people,'-men who preach one thing and practice another, and whose honesty is, therefore, brought into doubt. The fact is, they are just as strange s and inconsistent as the early Fathers, whose opin- ions they echo. "Again, I noticed as you read, a Repetition of the charge against King James, and I consider it a monstrous perversion of history. It occurs in the effort to get rid of the argument drawn from the a preposition with. The author makes Miss Earnest say: 'But why, Mr. Courtney, should our transla- tors employ with whenever in occurs in connection with baptism?' And Mr. Courtney is made to an- swer:* 'For the same reason that they refused to translate baptize. They were forbidden by King James to change the ecclesiastical words. They must not teach immersion.' "Now Nellie, just mark the consistency. Out of his own mouth the author stands condemned. is own testimony is, that at the very time when King James forbade the change of the ecclesiastical words, the Rubric of the Church of England did require Baptism by immersion, unless the candidate, adult or infant, was weakly. On page 62 he gives an extract from the journal of John Wesley, in which he says: 'Mary Welch, aged eleven days, was " baptized according to the custom of the First (i. e. Apostolic) Church, and the rule of the Church of   204       TEB JUDD FOAMLY. Eglan d-by immersion.' And yet *they must not translate Baptizo, lest they should teach immersion. So for the same reason they must- render en with, instead of i&, lest they should disturb the faith of the Church of England." "What glaring inconsistency," said Nellie. ( I think they must be hard pushed for argu. ments, when they are driven to suobh methods to sustain themselves,"' said Mrs. Judd. :r. Judd resumed: "As I said before, I know nothing  about the Greek, and cannot, therefore judge of the various meanings of Greek words. Bjlt there i: one thing I do know, because any plain, unlettered man can nsee it, and that is that the cause of Truth is, never promoted by misrepresentation, Victories gained at the expense of Christian charity are worse than defeats." -"But, father, why didn't the translators of the Bible translate ,Bptzqo into some old English word?" "For the best reason in the world, There was o such single word in our language that would convey  its precise meaning as a religious rite, Baptie was an English word used before they translated the Bible. Immerse would, not do, for young -men  and boys immerse themselves many times every summer, but are not Baptized.  The word spr ki  would not do, for people are of4e0 aught out in the rain, but are not Bptjized. A I   SCRIPTUAL BAPTIM.        $ the same way the words d/ip and pour would not do, for the reason that we dip our hands in the water when we wash, and often have water powred upon us, but in neither are we Baptized. None of these words express the t eal idea of that sacred rite, but the word Baptize does exactly. It is a religious word. It is derived from the word that Jesus used, that the Apostles used, and hence, since it :is the only word that embodies, in itself, the true idea, it was wise and Christian in the translators to employ it, and make it our own*" "'That, certainly, was a very gooad reason why the old Anglo Saxon fathers, who lived long before the translators of the Bible, should transfer the wjord into English. But what about the Greek word en, which they seem to think should be translated in, instead of with?" "There, Nellie, you have me. If H understood Greek I could answer your question. But a a plain, common man, I'll tell you how it looks-to me". The men who translated the Bible into English werei-the most learned men of their times. They werem em- bers of the Church of England; were great adiaiers of the Fathers, and-- were favorable to immersion as a made- of Baptism, and as ministers praeticed-E-in their ChurChes, except in the cases of sieknes and filing health. Now it seems to me:-that, had- it been proper to do so, they wouldl. have transated   206      THE JUDD FAMLY. fN, in, instead of with. Their prepossessions were all in, that direction, and the only reason why they did not was because, as honest men they could not.'" "Well," said Nellie, with a sigh, " truth is truth; and though error may seem to triumph for a while, begetting prejudice and partyism, and dividing the household of Faith, yet since God is God,e it is certain that Truth will finally gain the conquest of the world, and thus open the fountain of life, love, and charity, and so bring down to earth the har- mony and the bliss of heaven." "That is well said, Nellie," responded Mrs. Judd. "If He who bore our sins, and still bears the wants and woes of a world upon his own great heart of Love, silently works and patiently waits in pitying compassion for events to ripen, we also can' afford to work and wait till the precious seed of Truth sown by loving hands and trusting hearts, shall bring forth the golden harvest of millennial glory." "Welle llllie," said Mr. Judd, after a season of silence, "If you wish to read Theodosia any fur- ther, I will listen with all the patience I can com- mand." "I have no wish to read further, for in the re- view I -find no evidence to support the opinions here put forth thus far, and it is fair to assume that what we have'ead is but a sample of the balance of the book. , Its broad assumptions and unkind    SCREil'uHAL BAPTISM.  '   207 allusions are really ungenerous, to say the least, and so I beg to be excused." So Theodosia was quietly laid aside, to be re- stored to Susan Wilmot. After family worship that evening, fellie sat for a while, as if pondering some plan orl scheme in her mind. Then rousing up, she said:  "Father, wouldn't it be a good plan for me to write to brother William and tell him about our reading of Theodosia, and get him to make out a list of Greek words that have been transferred to our language? You know he is;studying Latin and Greek both. I don't suppose he has got far enough yet to do much at it, but if I call his attention to it now, he can be gathering them from time to time. I have an idea that the list will be larger than one would suppose.  It will be a source of instruction and gratification to me, and a means of improvement to him. And then, too, I have an idea that such an investigation may throw some light upon the ques- tions discussed in Theodosia. It is well to get as near the bottom of all truth as we can, and such an -inestigation will be likely to help in that direction." "I think, myself, your plan is a good one," said her' father. That night when Nellie retired to her room, it was with a deep sense of the goodness of God, in s                      .   2t sTHNE JUDD FAT*iY. giving her such kind Christian parents, through whose ever watchful love she had been, saved from the snare into which, in her youthful inexperience, she had fallen. And with a heart deeply moved, she fell upon her knees in devout thanksgiving to her Heavenly Father, that the snare had been broken, and that she was free.  COHTA PTER XII. "ORDING     to Nellie's proposition to write to her brother William, as hinted at the close ;of the last chapter, she embraced the first leisure mo- meAt, and penned the following letter: HOME, SWEET HOME,. Oct. 19th, 1856. DEAR BROTHEl WTT. TAM: How anxious I am to see you.  But I suppose I must be denied that privilege till your vacation next summer. At our family worship, morning and evening, dear father never forgets to pray for you, and we all join in- that prayer. I hope you are making fine progress in your studies, es- pecially in your Latin and Greek. I almost envy you the privilege of studying those ancient languages, particularly the Greek, because the words of celestial wisdom, as they fell from the lips of the adorable Jesus, were given in that language. I hope you will become a proficient in it. It must be a great privilege to read the very words that Jesus spake, and to catch the thoughts breathed out from His loving heart; for they were the utterances of infallible Truth-they were Spirit-they were Life. Dear brother, I have to narrate a little episode in mj experiencie, tit has occurred since you left home, for your ThJradd Family.    14   !b   210       THE JUDD FAMLY.. school. It stands in connection with my weakness and want of consideration. I really fell into the snare-a snare set for my inexperienced feet. But thanks to God for kind and intelligent Christian parents, through them the snare was broken,' and I am free. Now, dear brother, you will ask, in deep concern, what can it be? I will tell you. A few days ago, I was over at Mr. Wilmot's of an er- rand, when Susan handled me a book with a very attractive title. It was "THEODOSIA EARNEST; OR, THE HEROINE OF FAITH."   Susan said it was a beautiful book, and that I would never regret reading it. But she said, "Don't let your parents know  that you have it, for they will forbid you to read it, because it is opposed to their views of Bap. tism." I was just foolish enough to fall into that snare. I ought to have known better, and I am ashamed of it. I began to rad it slyly, and as the wise man says, "Stolen waters are sweet," I was strangely fascinated by it, and as I think of it now, it really seems strange that I should be, for there was no show of argument or reason to support its assertions; but I did not see it till mother caught me reading it, and after reading it a little herself, she pointed out its sophisms and assumptions,-I saw   them, and the charm was dissipated. I afterward undertook to read it to father and mother, but had not read the first volume half through, before I grew so-disgusted with it that I gave it uip. So much for the book. But a few questions have been raised in regard to the meaning of certain Greek words, connected with the sub- ject of Baptism, and other facts of revealed religion. And I wish to refer them to you for examination during your lture years of study, as I think it may be useful to you j      I also wish you to write out a list of Greek words that have been transferred to the English language without being translated into old English words, with their an- cient meaning with classical, or pagan Greeks, and any- new meaning that may have been  given taem --as used in modern times, an'd send it to me. I make this request because father says the meaning of words in one age is no sure criterion of their meaning in a subsequent one. Mr. Truman, also, says that as the an- cient Greeks werepiagan idolaters, and knew nothing about the truths of revealed religion, their language had no terms to express them; and hence, that when the Jews came to speak the Greek language, they were obliged to give a new meaning to many words to express their ideas of religious truth. Such a list as I request, will enable me to see the changes that time, and the introduction of new truths and *new ideas are making upon our forms of speech. Wishing you  the blessing of health, and a pure and noble. mind, with great success in your studies, I remain, as ever,         Your Loving Sister, NFL T.T JUDD. P. S. Let me hear from you soon. N J. AacrADIAx HALL, Nov. 5th,  1856 IfY DEAR STsER NTrr.-R: Your very interesting letter of Oct. 19th reached me in due time, and gave me great pleasure, and for two reasons. 1. Your readiness to confess your mistake, and the good sense you evinced in referring such questions to the greater knowledge and experience of our dear parents.   212       THE JUDD FAMLY. 2. The lively interest you take in such learned questions. I have never looked into these questions myself, before, but your suggestions and your request has awakened a new train of thought, and a new purpose. I believe in sifting such questions, and indeed, all questions, to the bottom. And I mean to devote at least a portion of my leisure hours to such questions. I have oommenced already, and as a re. sult, I send you, as you request, a partial list of Greek words adopted, bearing upon religious questions, with the new, definitions given them under the moulding influence of Hebrew and Christian civilization. Now, sister Nellie, if you wish to know how large a class of Greek and Latin words have been adopted into our language, you have but to go to Webster's Dictionary Un- abridged. In looking into this matter, after receiving your letter, I was perfectly astonpished at the number. If we were to strike out all such words 'from our language, we could scarcely hold a conversation of five minutes duration, even on the most common topics. I have had time to select but a few words, as the fol- lowing list will show, but I send them in the hope that you may-find some illustration from them.

(a) Angdos, in classic Greek, means nothing but messen- ger-one who bears a message. But among the Jews, it had a higher signification. It meant a spiritual being superior to man, holy and good, because it was supposed they were Divine messengers to men. (b) The word B  los-bo-f&, the book, without reference to authorship or contents. But among Jews and Christians it is as a name restricted to the sacred books of the Jews and Christiap. (c) Baptizo among the pagan Greeks had no religious or spiritual significance, and referred only to things natural and material,  Among the Jews it was taken to expres their purifications, ceremonial and moral. Such is its meaningsin the New Testament. (d) DaWtn u was the name given to an invisible epirit-a spirit who was believed to be sulerior to mean  The anint   214        THE 'JUDD FAMTT;Y; believed there were demons, good and evil, who had influence over the minds of men, and who carried on an intercourse between the gods and men; conveying the addresses of men to ,the gods, and of bearing benefits to men, or - becoming the instruments of the vengeance of the gods. Hence dewmo became the objects of Worship. It was supposed also, that human spirits, after their departure from the body, became demons, But among the Jews the word waW used for evil spirits only, while Angelos was applied to good spirits. (e) Diabolical, from Diabolus, means devilish, wicked. (f) Diakonos, Deacon, means servant, or one who serves another, and hence is applied to an officer in the Christian assemblies or churches, whose office it was to look after the temporal affairs of the Church. (g) Eclesia, the term used for the Christian assemblies (Church), is applied to all religious gatherings, and purely Church affairs, and hence the term eccleaiastical is of general application to religious assemblies and religious affairs. (h) Bishop is a corruption of Episcopos, and among the early Christians meant just what the term imports-an over- seer or inspector, one who looked after the spiritual affairs of 'the Church. Hence it meant only the minister or pastor, having the general oversight and care of the body. Among the Methodist'Episcopal, and all the non-episcopal bodies, it means simply a general overseer. With the Catholics and some Episcopalians, it-ris used for an order of the priesthood, above pastors of local, Churches. (i) Pneuma, from which our scientific word pneumatics comes, meant among the pagan Greeks simply wind. air, breath, vapor, etc., while the word for ghost or spirit was DaimoM. Among the Jews it had the additional meaning- ghost or spirit, and is used in the New Testament for the    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.        215 Holy Ghost or Spirit, from the fact that He comes by an in- spiration, or breathing into the soul of man.

Five years have passed since the cor- respondence between Nellie and himself.  He is now in his last, or senior year in college. These have been years of earnest, manly study-of thor- ough mental discipline. During his college course, he too, has found a personal interest in his Re- deemer, and Divine love, with the joy and peace it brings, has given a new inspiration and a new aim to his life. From the new stand-point of Chris- tian love, he has looked out upon the moral dark- ness and disorder of the world, and something of the compassion of Jesus moves his heart. He thinks himself called to the Christian ministry. He is, therefore, devoting all his spare time to those read- ings and investigations connected with his chosen life-work. James Wilmot is also pursuing a course of study in the same college. - As school-mates and old     neighbors, they often isit' eiwh  otthe  a-t s theit rooms.  These seasons are often enlivened withi spicy debates upon topics connected with their ant- ticipated professions. James is; preparing, for the profession of tChe law. He isi a young man of some talent; and  good deal of: assurance and reasdy wit, iThough actt religious, he; is by no means skeptical. He cherishes a deep respect for religion, aas he un Idersands it, and; in this respect he exhibits the Iraoalding effect of home influence ;. and henee, his,  tyle of reasoning will be found to be different fronm' ihat. of William!

"Good evening, Jame^?' said Williami witi ^ smile,.: " ome: in, I am:. glad to. see you.' "Well, Williami this Iboks as though yout had; made a pretty; large draft; upon the college library," said James,; looking. around  upons the: books and-   218      .'1B JUDD FAMLY.    lexicons scattered upon the table. "What deep problem in ethics are you working out? Fixing up for the future, I suppose." Yes," said William, "fixing up for the future., I amnfter the real meaning of a class of Greek words that I find in connection with the duties of revealed religion; and among them the word Bap- tizo, and its root Bapto.," "W]hy,' you goose, Will! That is as plain as the road to dinner. It don't require any deep re. search to find out that. Go to your lexicon--that will tell you. Its root meaning is to dip, to immerse, nothing but to immerse," said James. Now James, I am really surprised to hear you talk so superficially. You ought to know better. This whole question lies deeper than the diction- aries. - They are good enough in their place, but the best Greek or English lexicons are, to a certain extent, imperfect. I know what the most of them say on this subject. Almost all words have a pri- mary and secondary meaning; and while the most of our modern lexicographers give dipping and im- mersion as the first, or most frequently met with definition of the word, yet it is by no means cer- tain to my mind that either of those words contain the real root thought of the word. I believe the real root thought, if we can find it, will be found t to run through all the various definitions of the   ScERI1PTUBAL BAPTISM.     219 word. Our modern lexicographers are not native Greeks, and their knowledge of the language is such as they have  gaihed from the study of ancient Greek authors, and that is not enough. They need- - ed to mingle in the daily life of that people to fully understand the inner life of their ideas. I repeat it, I believe our best modern lexicons are, after all, imperfect; not in the grammatical construction of the language, nor in the fullness of their vocabula- tries, but imperfect in the definitions they give." f' Oh, fudge! William, you are always following after some strange phantom. All there is of Bap- tism is found in the word immersion. It expresses action-nothing but action," said James. "So then, you would cratup it to a mere exter- nal action, and rob it of its beauty and moral sig- nificance. If I am fanciful, you' are superficial," I said William. "Oh, as to that," said James, "I suppose it is a test of obedience, and is symbolical of our Savior's burial and resurrection." "Well said, James. Don't charge me with pur- suing phantoms after this. Your fancy must bie made of india rubber, if it can stretch far enough 'to find the burial and resurrection of Christ in the ordinance of Baptism. What proof have you that it symbolizes :the burial and resurrection of Christ?" "Does n't Paul say 'we are buried with him by   2".-}     .agBH J T FAMWEY Atism,  anid Peterv the like figure whereunto: even. baptism. doth also now save us by the resur l rectiion of Jesus Christ.' And: then, too, Paul says, ' For if we havebeen planted together in the like. ness of his death, we shall be. alo in, the likeness of' his resurrection.' " Jamnes thought he had given William a clincher, and his eyes sparkled with a feeling of triumph. 'Well said, James. I'll give you the palm for ingenuity," said William. "And that is the way you make out the symbolic character of Baptism, by supposing some resemblance between the exter- nal act of immersion and emersion, and- the burial and resurrection of Christ. So, when you and I went into Ahe river bathing the other day, and went under the Water and then came up again, that was symbolic of the burial and resurrection of Christ, I suppose, and we too, were Baptized,'" "( Oh no," said James. "That was not Baptism. Don't treat the subject so lightly, William." "But if your position is true, that Baptize always means to dip or immerse, and never expresses any- thing but mode or action, it must be that we were BSaptized, and that our immersion and emersion was. 8smbolic of the burial and resurrection of Christ. Neow James, there- is no dodging this conolusion, only, as you give up your position, And then, too,   SCRiP'UAL IflP^it.      221 I  man see no moral end of good in you idea ofr th symbolic design of the rite." Well, since you o6bjedt to, my idea 6f the syi- bolic design of the rte', do- be good enough toi tell me what you think about it," said James. ",That is soon and easily told," said Williaim. "As an external rite it symbolizes the: higher-the' Spiritual Baptism; and th language of tie symbol is purity, moral purity, and whenever we receive it, we say that we are sinful, aid have need of the- moral cleansing wrought iii us by the Spiritual' Baptism." "tW-ell, William, I must confess that there- is beauty and force id youl view of the symbo1lic de- sign of the' ordinance'i said Jariiesi But I can:' give up my opinion that B:phzo mieas; imriers'e' and nothing else.

For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean., sane- tifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ,' etc. Now James, don't you see that the persons and things purified were never immersed in blood?" "I don't care a fig for all that. The divers Bap- tisms must have been divers immersions;/ for Car- son has-proved that Baptize always means to im- merse, and nothing else. And to this definition all the lexicons agree. The trouble is that our comrn v mon version of the Bible is not a true and faithful  one. The mass of readers do not understand the original, and translators of the Bible by adopting Greek words instead of translating them, have hid- den the meaning from the multitude." "I suppose then, you think the translators of the Bible were dishonest men," said William, with a smile. "No, not exactly that; but they were forbidden by King James to translate the ecclesiastical words, for fear of disturbing the faith and practice of the Church of England." "So then, King James was the great, sinner," saide William, with ahlaugh. "Well now, James, do tell me what particular word your great name- sake would not permit to be translated, lest it should,   SCRIPTUEAL BAPTISM.      223 disturb the faith and practice of the English Ohurch." "Why, the word Baptizo." William could not refrain from a hearty uproar- ious- laugh. "What on earth are you laughing at, Will?" said James.              * a "I am laughing at your honest simplicity," said William. "So you really suppose your statement to be correct?" "Of course I do., Do you suppose I would state a tamg for truth that I do not beiieve to be true?" i"Certainly not, James. But then, I fear you are relating a matter of hearsay--a thing that is not borne out by the facts in the history of the trans- lation of our version of the Bible. Do you know what the faith and practice of the Church of Eng- land was at that time?" "Really, William, you've got me now. But I suppose it was wholly in favor of sprinkling." "The reverse of this was the case. The faith and practice of the Church of England was in favor of immersion; and the Rubric of that Church re- quired it, except in, cases of sickness, or of persons in declining health," said William. "If that was so, why didn't they translate the word instead of adopting it?"  "For one of the plainest reasons in the world," said William. "There was no word in the language   that wpold convey the exact meaning of the word," "But they might have translated itimmerse." "We were immersed the, other: day, but you say we were not Baptized; and then immerse is a Latin word adopted into the language just as Bapti'zo is," said William. "But suppose they had taken the word dap, or )lunge. They are not adopted," saidJaimes. "I dcip my pen in ink when I write, I do not immerse it,; and a horse plunges often without be  ing immersed." "Well, take the word duck then," said James, I\ and he burst into a laugh,- at, the idea suggested by the word. "But you will say that duck means to   "V ery true," said William. "And to my mind  the noise that is made about the non-translation of [ the word Baptizo, is entirely without: any, founda-  tion. To have translated it,; would have blurred its meaning by confounding its religious with its secu- lar definition. It is only when it is used to denote the Christian rite of Baptism that it is left muntrans- lated. In all other instances it is translated. There is no reason in the world: for thinking that our translators were either ignorant or dishonest men.. Had they not turned  aptizo: into- an English word,! they must have expressed it by a circumlocution that would have amounted to a gloss, rather- than   6STURAB L AIBAPTISM.     X a translation, or they must have coined a new wor    for the purpose. Besides, the Word Baptizo was already in the English langu#g:e having been: used from the time of Chaucer, and even by the Anglo- Saxons themselves." "Well, really, William. You seem  to have. studied this subject pretty thoroughly," said James. "You seem to be taking all thei wind out. of my objections," "I have not said all my say yet," said William,. laughing. "I have yet another reason why it woul  not do to translate the word by using dip or sm- merse. It is this: A large part of the learned; world fully believe that Baptism, in the New Tes. tament, often  signifies X an  application by water, which was' performed /by sprinkling  or pouring, How, therefore, could we have a Bible in which all: denominations may agree, if we insist upon trans- lating the word by immerse, by pour, or by sprin- kle. Were there no other reason, this: would be     1 sufficient for adopting the original word,. instead of translating it by either." "I suppose you know that the Baptist denoms.  ination have got up a  new, translation of the Bible, I in which they translate the word immers aid  imn-  donw," said James.          , "Yes," said William, "and the America an.

One is, that they arrogate to themselves the prerogative of alone giv. ing a true and faithful version of the Sacred Scrip. tures, and by implication, condemn the present authorized version as unfaithful. The other is, that, if we leave the word untranslated, that is, standing upon its own merits, people will draw some other meaning from it than immersion. That is, that the word Baptizo is so used in the New Testament as almost without fail, to lead those who learn its meaning from the Bible alone to conclude that it does not in the Bible mean imnmersion." "Well William, you are getting me so foggeda up that I don't know what to believe, or what to think," said James.- "I getting you befogged, James? How' s that? I have done the best I could to get you out of the fog," said William, laughing.' '"I am fogged when I find learned men taking such different views in regard to the question of Baptism."  "Would you like to have me lead you out of your dilemma, James?" \"If you can, William; but that is the question "-can you?hi 6'I can try, for I think I have the key that will   SCIPTRtAL BAPTIXS.      227^  unlock the difficulty," said William. "It is just here. Those upon whom you have been accustomed to lean for information on this subject have drawn their ideas from the musty folios of paganism. They have overlooked the fact that as the human mind. progresses in knowledge-as newo facts, net  truths, and 'new principles are unfolded, unknown before-- new woords must be coined to express them, or old words, in some respects analogous, must be taken, and a new and accommodated  meaning given to them, while at the same time the old meaning still attacles to them. Thus, if you  please, the -word, Bapto originally meant one of two things. Either to dye, to color, to stain; and the idea of dipping or immersion grew out of it from the fact, that-. things dyed or colored, were4 dipped or immersed to that end, or the converse of this must be- true. Then the word came to put on other meanings; thus gemizo, to fill; brecho, to wet, moisten, bedew; pleno, to wash, viz., clothes; and sutleo, to draw, to pump water. What is true of Bapto, is equally true of Baptizo, as a derivative from it. Thus, we find at a period long before the Christian era, when i the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus was translated. : into the Greek for the use of the Alexandrian Jews, . the word was used as a synonym for louo and lou,-. tro, as in the following passage, chap. xxxiv, 30: 'He that washeth himself because of a dead body,   2NW      V1ti JWbD F' X.1 atnd toucheth it agasing , what avsileth his w ashing? Heru, James, see forz yomurself"' said William, hand. ing a, copy of the work in, Gtieek;l james took. the. book /and looked at the passage. Sure enough. While: the word uoashieth a- *  bap- tiob3mwos (Baptized3),3 the word ais ibaiii is loutr; showing- coniildasively that the writer helda the: two? words as, synonyious. A new light began toI dawn on Jaies' mind. So, without puriisuing the thought further in regaid. to the chantges. in the1 meaning1 of the: word Baptio, William ealled his attention, to other *ords. : Look. here, James," said he, "here is the' Greek Worad;pneutm, in classic G-reek it meatns nothing but: wind, air, or breath. Suppose we applay Mr. Oarson's rule. 'Pnezuma: means nothing but wind. I. cas prove it by'all the 'jreek cl$assids, and all thd lexicon; say ay so.'

W meaning analagous to its ordinary d e.tiea"  ' inspiration or inbreathing of God; His breath upoa; the soul. Here, too, is the Greek word Anipeo. In classical Greek it means measenger, and nothing else. But I find the word in use among the 'Jexw as the name of an order of spiritual beings, superior in rank to man, holy and good. And "here: agaian, the new use of the word comes in the way of an- alogy,: from the fact that, according to Hebrew Theology, such beings- were mediums and messen. gers between God and men. At this point, it must be borne in mind that the Greeks: had a name for: such an order of beings in general.  DaimOn and' daimonita, and in the mythological opinions of thei Greeks, some of the demons were: good, and othersc bad. Under the moulding theology of the He-brews, the. word was used only' with reference to, wickedi- spirits or devils; while the word anyelos was thaot name given to good spirits. Such too, as you know, are the recognized definitions of the two word&s in;i the New   Testament, the heathen- classics and: th-6W lexicons notwithstanding."  "Yes," said James, "I know    that the words angel and demno   have just the meaning with ud that? you mention." "And then, too, you will see the proprietry of adopting these words, instead of translating' theeri as the: BaptisetBille Soiety fwoulrd :hav eusdofrobat ,  A                     .   $80       THE JUDD PAMYTY.:  the consideration of Acts xxIII, 8, where to trans.- late them'would make the most arrant nonsense, In- our common .version, the passage reads thus:  'For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.' -The word resurrection here falls -undei' the same rule, if we take its meaning from the classic  Greek. The Greeks had no idea of the resurrection of the body, and, of course, no word to express it. The Greek word anastasis-rising up, was the near* est approach to it, and referred only to a ' rising up' from a reclining posture. Suppose we translate the passage according to the wishes of the Baptist Bible Society, thus: 'Fobr the Sadducees say there is no risinng up, neither messenger nor wietd, but the  Pharisees confess both.' Don't you see, James, that - such a translation is to make the Bible speak, not only nonsense, but falsehood?" "I see it," said James. "The practical effect , of such a translation would be to hide the truth and pervert the Word of God. Strange that I had not thought of it before!" "But James, the same reason existed for con- verting -the -Greek 1Japtizo into the English .Baptize,  as for converting angelos into angel. There was no word in English which would fill up the idea I If Baptism was to be performed by sprinkling, it would. not do to translate Baptizo by :the: word sprinkle,   SCaIPTUAL - BAPTISM.     21 because all sprinkling is not Baptism. If Baptism were exclusively by immersion, still the word im- merse would not express the whole of the essential idea, for all immersion is not Baptism." "There certainly is force in your reasoning, Wil- liam," said James, who had listened with increasing interest as William had gone on, step; by step, in his argument. "There is one thought more in this connection that I wish to bring to your attention," said William. "It is this: The word Baptizo in the New Testa- ment refers less to the manrer of the application of water, than to the design" id import of the appli- cation. It is a sacred application--a ritual applica- tion, denoting a ritual purifying, and referring to an important and essential truth for its signijica- tion. ' As William closed his argument, James roused up, looked at his watch, spoke about returning to his room and to his studies, but did not seem in any hurry to go. William, therefore, took his dis- position to remain as an indication of willingnessi for further discussion; and so to draw him out, he said.: "Now James, since the talk has mainly been on my side, and you have been mostly--a listener, let me inquire what do you think of my views of the topics that have been brought under review?"    2        TREL. UD& FAMY.0. "'I. think you- have a: good deal of truth on, your side of this, qestion. And I believe; itfdoes a: fellow good- to find out what other people believes, Ad tow they believe. It is:' likely to enlarge' the field of one's knowledge, you, know. But. still, I go for im- ms rsgon. All the Greek lexicons give. that as the proper definition, of Baptizeo' "I admit that nearly all the modernlexicograph. era, and especially those who are not native Greeks, give that aa theleading definition; of .Baptizo. But, as I. said before, while they understaod the, gram,' matical; relation. of words, by their affixes and suf. fites, as, to mood, tense and, case,. and; the like, and while they- give us. very full vocabularies of Greek words,: yet I think they- are less to be:. relied on. as to, the, real,;. meauing of words; than, a native;, Greek lexicographer, one who understood the inner lime of Grecian thought. It is this that- leads me to doubt if our lexicographers have given, the ,definitions of BRapto and tBaptizoe in their proper order." "There is no doubt, William, in my mind, that. native Greek lexicographers: understand, the genius: and force. of Greek words; better;, thaan anyv man can who merely learns the language from   books. N3Ba tive Greeks- ought to .nuerstand, their own language better: than foreigners," said James.. 'Herezft my; hand for that, my, igood afellowi," said: William,. giongi abmes a. hearty shake? of the band&.   -"'If there is -some .fun and nonsense in your head, it's only the zspiee ,of life, and there is also a capital vein of strong common sense--I   mean practical' good sense." James was a good deal lattered with Wiliam's compliments, so he said: "Yes, William; the native ,Greeks must under- stand their own language ibetter than foreigners, and they have ALWAys understood the word Baptism to signify dipping. In this case, ,the Greeks are UNEXCEPTIONABLE GUIDES " Then, after a moment he continued: "You confess, William, that all the modern lex- icographers give' dipping,' plunging and immersing as the undoubted primitive meaning of the word; and in this definition the native Greeks are with them, and against you."           : "Do you throw that out as a challenge for me to prove to the contrary?" said William, with a knowing smile. "I do if you wish to take it so," said -James, with a feeling that his position was unassailable. "CBe it so, then," said William. "I will then turn to native Greek lexicographers to show you that your challenge can be triumphantly met, and even if the, Greek Church practices immnersion always (which, by the way, they do not), yet it is uot-be- cause they consider immersion as essential from the   THEE JUDD FPAMTTr Y meaning of the word. And since, as you say, 'na tive Greeks are unexceptionable guides,' we will see what they say." He then took up a volume entitled "Chronicle of the Church," published at New Haven, in 1838, and read as follows: "The oldest native Greek lexicographer is HESY- cilius, who lived in the fourth century of the Chris. tian era. He gives only the word Bapto, and the only meaning of the word he gives is antleo-to pump, or to draw water." "Now  James, if this native Greek had considered dip, plunge, or immerse the primary or most important meaning of the word, don't you think he would have given it?" James admitted that such would have been the case. But inasmuch as he gives antleo as the only meaning of the word, it shows that to have been the most common and familiar meaning of the word. William read on as follows: "Next in order comes SUIDAS, a native Greek, who wrote in the tenth century. He gives only the derivative Baptizo, and defines it by pluno, to wash." "Here is another native Greek," said William, "who does not consider dip, plunge or immerse as a leading definition." "We come down to the present century," said William, as he read on, "at the beginning of which we find GAsES, a learned Greek, who, with great   SCRIT'iUBRAL BAPTISM.   235   labor and pains, compiled a large and valuable lex- icon of the ancient Greek language. His book, in two volumes, quarto, is a work deservedly held in high estimation by all, and is generally used by native Greeks. It should also be remarked that he was a member of the Greek Church, which always Baptizes by immersion, except in cases of extreme urgency. The following are his definitions of Bay- to and Baptizo: BAPTO- Brecho-To wet, moisten, bedew. Pluno-To wash (viz., clothes). Gemizo-To fill. Buthio-To dip. Antleo-To draw, to pump water. BAPTIZO- Brecow-To wet, moisten, bedew. Louo-To wash, to bathe. Antlo-To draw, to ump water. "There, James, you have the definitions of a native Greek, who you say is vastly better authority than European lexicographers, one who does not give dipping or immersion as the primitive signification of Baptizo, and indeed, does not give it at all, ex- cept perhaps inferentially, as dip, one of the defi- nitions of Bapto, does not cover the idea of im- mersion. It is a clear case then, that the native Greeks, themselves, do not consider the word as   'DiBE J;lUDD PAMNFLY T meaning necessarily an immersion. In fact, they do not give it at all as the primary, or leading idea of the word." James was entirely taken down. This was tes.' timony he did not expect, and it gave an entirely pew phase to the question. His faith began to waver in regard to immersion. It might have been the Apostolic mode, and he thought it was; but it was not essential to valid Baptism. He determined to go over the entire ground for himself, and be open to conviction, let the proof come from what quarter it might. Finally, after thinking over the matter in this vein for a few moments, he said: "Well, William, I give it up. You've gone into this matter deeper than I supposed you had. You have taken the wind out of my sails, and here I am becalmed. I really think you'll have to tow me into port." And he gave himself up to a hearty laugh, in which William joined. ' Really, William, you are becoming a personage of some importance in my eyes. I hope you will pardon me for calling you fanciful. I guess the blur was upon my eyes instead of yours. I begin to feel some of the inspiration of your spirit, and if I have been superficial in the past, I'll try not to be in the future." "My good friend, I have as much need to ask your forgiveness for calling you superficial, as you   have for calling me fanciful. Both chargeg were uttered playfully, and are not worth the mention. So I think we'll drop them," said William. "You said the question of Baptism, lay deeper than the dictionaries, William. I begin to think you are half right. You spoke also of the root thought' of .Bapto and of its derivative, Baptizo. I would like to understand the idea that is struggling in your mind, in regard to the root thought of thee two words." "Oh, well, James, it may not be worth much. It is not a matter that I intend to get patented, and since thoughts are common property, you may have them for just what you think they are worth, and pay to the Master," said William. He continued; "All words have a primary and secondary meaning, and the question with me is what was the primary meaning of Bapto.  I am aware that this question stands but remotely coqn nected with the mode of Baptism, and yet the proper solution of this question may throw some light upon the general question of Baptism-at least in regard to its deep import. I think I have the key that may unlock this question and show it up in a new light." "If so, pray what is it, William? Do let me hear it." "It is this. From a careful examination of set-    288      THE JUDD FAMLY.  -eral of the earliest Creek writers, with special ref.  erence to this question, two definitions of the word  arrested my attention. The more frequent of the  two was that of dipping, which in some cases  amounted to immersion. The other definition was  to dye, to color, to stain, to tinge. I suppose it was  from observing these facts that modern lexicogra-  phers have given dipping and immersion as the first  definitions of the word. But to my mind it is by no means certain that dipping was its primary  meaning. Judging from the analogy of thought, it  is apparent to me that the primary meaning of the  word, is to dye, to color, to stain, and dipping is a  secondary meaning growing out of the fact that  things colored or dyed were usually dipped, to that end. And now for the root thought of Bapto. As in the case of dyeing or coloring, the substances or materials dyed or colored receive into themselves the coloring fluid which radically changes their  texture and appearance, so I conceive the root  thought is the radical change wrought in one sub- stance by the infusion of another. Now it seems to me that this, as a root thought, is more or less apparent in all the uses to which the word and its derivatives have been put; and this root thought becomes strikingly apparent in Baptism as the sym- bol of that divine and radical change wrought in the heart and so in the life by the inbreathings of   SERIPTURAL BAPTISM.      239 the Holy Spirit. In this view Baptism more than symbolizes purity-moral purity-it is the symbol of that Divine life which the indwelling of Christ begets in the human soul-the essential elenmet of which is love." -1I declare, William. You exhibit a good deal of originality of thought," said James. "And- if you keep on at this rate, some of the, colleges will confer the title of D. D. upon you before many years." And he broke out into a half serious half comical laugh. "I presume you think me rather visionary, James," said William, " in entertaining and giving expression to the idea that has impressed itself upon my mind. I confess it is original with me; bult it certainly carries a kind of sweet inspiration with it which half assures me of its truth; and, if true, the reason why Baptizo should be taken as the name of that sacred ordinance, in preference to any of the several Greek words by which its several modi- fications of meaning are set forth, at once becomes apparent." "Now William, do not mistake me," said James. "Far be it from me to treat the opinions of a friend as visionary. I confess I am not prepared to ex- press an opinion as to the idea or inference you draw in regard to the root thought of the word. It was the newness of the thought, and your- evident   240      VTI JItDD IPA-0wt41. earaestness aud sincerity that provoked that laugh, I hope my mirthfulness did not offend you." 'Certainly not, James. But I know the in. fluence under which your opinions upon the subject of Baptism have been formed, and the style- of ar- gument to which you have been accusthmed to listen; and I could not expect you to adopt other opinions suddenly, even if they were true. Hence, I supposed my idea of the root thought of Bapto  struck your mind as chimerical." "You are very considerate, William," was James' reply. I must confess that our little chat this evening is not without its effect in modifying my views. You have presented a class of facts new to me. And, while I cannot say that my views as to immersion- as the proper and Scriptural mode are altered in the least, yet I stand corrected as to the argument drawn from the meaning of the word. Our people-the Baptists, I mean-have laid too much stress upon the meaning of Baptizo, as it was evidently used in connections where the idea of im- mersion is entirely excluded." "Then you admit that the proof for immersion, if found at, all, must be found outside of the philo- logical definition of the word itself; 'that is, the question lies deeper than Jthe dictionaries," said William. I r                  E 'Yes, William.   We have got to go to the   JSCzIP'1UAL BAPTISM.     241 Bible to settle this question. It is not whatthe heathen Greeks meant by the word, but what Christ and His Apostles meant by it." "You are certainly on the right track, James, and I hope you will make thorough work of it, till  it looms up before your mind in its beauty and moral significance, and becomes a sanctifying power in your heart." James looked thoughtful, but made no reply; and after a few wirds in reference to college affairs, that James had called in specially to talk over with William, the two friends parted for the night. the Judd rFPll.   ] O  ,     4p       TSB JUDD VAYX  CHAPTERE XIV. The twilight of a better day is dawning, The shades of sin and guilt shall pass away* The sun of righteousness restores the mornini And rolling upward brings meridian day. "N HS way back to his room, and after he ar- rived there, James gave himself to the following soliloquy: "William truly is a noble fellow, and aims to become a thorough scholar. He tries to go to the bottom of every question he investigates, and that certainly is commendable. I know it is liable to lead a man too far into the region of spec ulation, at, least those who may chance to differ with his conclusions will think so. But what pro gress would there be in any branch of truth with out such men? Suppose they do follow phantoms sometimes, it is better to have it so than to have no progress. All the great reformers of the world have been men who have looked beneath the sur- face of things, and have sought to improve the coun   SCRlt"uRAL BAPTISM.     2483  dition of society by giving* prominence and force to fundamental truths. "' It may be that William's position in regard to the root thought and primary meaning of Ba/:to is right. But if it is wrong I don't see that it can do any harm. It is certain that it sometinies meats to dye, to color. That then is one of its meanings. it does not, therefore, always mean to dip, to immereb When Homer tells about the battle of the Frogin and Mice on the borders of the lake, and says the lake was Bapto'd with blood, that could not be ati immersion. And so when Hippocrates  says of a certain liquid that when it drops on the garments they are Bapto'd, it can't mean immerse. And since Baptizo is a diminutive from Bapto, it certainly has a greater latitude of meaning. It is also evi- dent from the quotation that William made from Ecclesiasticts that Baptizo and louo are used inter- changeably. It follows, therefore, that .they aire synonymous. Baptizo must therefore mean to twash, to purify. And since these purifications were per- formed by pouring  water on the hands in some cases, and in others by sprinkling blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer, with scarlet wool and hyssop, it follows that there was jo rm- mersion in these cases. It would not do, tiereore, to- always translate the word immerse; and then, too, immerse does not cover the entire meaning of H   244      THE JUDD FAMLY. the word Baptizo. Yes, William  was right about aadopting the word into English, instead of transla- ting it. Other words are also adopted. There is angel, and demon, and-pentecost, and a host of other words transferred from Greek to English; and even immerse, and tinge, and spirit are Latin words adopted into our language. How simple it is for our folks to make such ado about not translating these words. "And now," said James, as he continued to so- liloquize, "if they are wrong in one case, possibly they may be wrong in another. Perhaps, after all, sprinkling and pouring may be valid modes of Bap- tism; and, if so, then the practice of close coma: munion is wrong. It is an objectionable feature in Baptist Church polity, a ny way. I know that father and mother argue in its favor, but I never did like it, and I don't think I ever shall. "If I thought I was a Christian, I should cer- tainly want to go to the communion table with William and Nellie, for if they are not Christians, I don't know where to find any.  And then, too) there are their parlents, Mr. and Mrs. Judd. They are among the best Christians I know of. It always displeased me to gee Deacon Jones pass right by, and not offer them the bread and wine. "And then there are Mr. and Mrs. Alvord. They are as good Christians as can be found any-   wVl^tJ*uD A PrThS^ U M,  246 where. And they  and Mr. Judd's  people almost always commune with each other. "When at home, last vacation, I attended Mr. Truman's meeting. It-was their communion Sab- bath, and there was Mr. and Mrs. Alvord in the same slip with Mr. and Mrs. Judd, and they par- took of the Lord's Supper together. It did look so good. And only three weeks afterward, at the Quarterly Meeting in the Methodist Church, Mr. Truman gave up his morning service, and the two Churches came together.  Mr. Truman attended, and assisted the Presiding Elder in the distribution of the bread and wine; and all the members of his Church present went forward. And there again Mr. Judd and Mr. Alvord knelt side by   side. It looked so brotherly and Christian-like it deeply affect- ed me. I really wish father and mother would give it up. Wouldn't it look pleasant to see the three fam-, ilies sit at the Lord's table together." And he threw up his head as the  thought passed through his mind. From this time on to the close of his college year, the thought was often in his mind-and closely associated with it was the inquiry why he was not a  Christian. He felt that he ought to be; butstill the subject was deferred, he could scarcely tell why. At length the close of the college  year came, and with its Commencement exercises, was to close   246       THt JUDD PAMLYt. WilliamS's term of study; He was to graduate, anid take his first degree. These are occasions of un. usual interest, especially to the parents -and friends of the graduating classes. Mr. Judd and Nellie were  among  those who dcame to attend these interesting exercises; doubly so to them, because a son and brother was to take so prominent a part. William had, been selected to deliver the salutatory in Latini His, clear and distinct enunciation and musical voice fitted him nicely for that task. And besides' this he was to deliver an oration, upon the Progress of Human Thought. His genirus and cast of mind fitted him also for this. But while Mr. Judd snd Nellie; were so joyful at the termination of William's course in college, aMnd the honors that a/wakted him a feeling of sadness came; over James. though William's senior in age by two years, he was behindl him one year in his college course; and he should feel so, lonely in the absence of so dear a friend as William had proved himself to be. The graduating exercises passed off finely. The orations of the graduating class were highly cred- itable to the, young gentlemen; but William bore iff -the palm.

But when he came to deliver his oration in English, he exhibited such variety and depth of research, and his facts and arguments were so clearly and beautifully stated, and evinced '.h a power,of' analysis and logical correctness , tjhe seemed to outdo himself, and it was pronounced THE oration of the day. James felt really proud of his friend, and won- deled if he would be able to. carry off the palm in that way at the next commencement. Nellie-was all smiles, for her heart was filled with gladness0; and as James 0loked upon her, he thought shenever seemed so angelic before. By an arrangement with Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Jndd came prepared to take James back with him, in company with William and Nellie. ;It was a pleaal ant ride to James, and in their company the hoar passed quickly away. He founl that:Nelhe had also made good use of her time in the improvement ;of her mind, and Ihe thought her as accomplished ia her manners as -he was gentle and, a iable in her disposition.

Sometimes they wandered in the shady grove that skirted the bank of the stream  a that meandered near Mr. Judd's mansion, and some-  times they fished together in a beautiful crystal lake situated -some half-mile beyond Mr. Wilmots. Fre- quently in these rambles Nellie and Susan accom- panied their brothers, and shared in their recreations, @ or listened to their recitations or debates, not un- frequently joining in the discussions. Williams' sojourn at home was soon to terminate. He was -to leave for the theological seminary, The Master's work was pressing, and he must prepare  for it with all reasonable dispatch. If he seemed to  delay in that work it was only that he might be  the better fitted to meet its responsibilities. He  remembered that Jesus did not begin his public the ministry till he was thirty years of age; not, as He  thought, because He was not fitted for it at an   a earlier day, but to teach His followers that it were for better to defer it to that age than to enter upon it without due preparation. The two students were not only together in their  wi rambles, as referred to-above, but James was often jus a visitor at Mr. Judd's, and at the close of each  visit he left with a deeper conviction of the beauty wil of true religion, and of his need of it. William and Nelhe had both observed this, and  see.   SCRBIPTURAL BAPTISM.     249  it had been a matter of consultation between them as to what each could do to lead him to the Savior. They, therefore, embraced every proper opportunity to make such remarks as they thought calculated to lead to that happy event. Nor were these labors to be lost upon him.  The Divine Spirit was at work through them to bring him in penitence to the Savior's feet. Daily, also, did they bear him in earnest prayer to the Throne of Grace.   In the moral, as in the natural world, there is seed time and harvest; and "He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come -again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."' The time at length arrived fur William to leave for the seminary. The evening before he left, James came to bid him farewell. William seized this, as the last opportunity, to press upon him the duty of an immediate submission to God. He told him how deeply he had felt, and how earnestly he had prayed for him.  "And Nellie, too," said William, "feels as I do in regard to your spiritlal well being. And now, dear James, will you not promise me that you. will not longer put off this important work?  Come just as you are, and take Jesus just as He is. He is able and willing this moment to save you, if you will throw yourself in penitence at His feet."   James was melted into tears, and promised that he would seek the Savior without delay.   "Oa       i be  .A D FM,'YT clfn it be possible,' said James to himself, as he- walked home that night, "that William aid Nel- lie are so deeply interested in my spiritual welfare, and I sot indifferent about it-so disposed to defer it? Why this indifference-this aversion?  Ah I my heart is alienated from  God.   A being so0. good, so true, so patient, and One so worthy of my love!"And he fairly groaned under the weight of that thought. When he reached his room  he threw himself upon his knees -in a mournful confession of his sin  and guilt, and tried, as he thought, to give his heart to God, But all seemed dark and Void, and he felt  with himself like one beating the air. Hateful and j unbelieving doubts would thrust themselves into his i mind. W, Was there a God, and was rtot the idea of God; a myth? If there was a God, where is He? o If He -is great and full of Divine majesty, would' He care for, or trouble Himself about suck a worm of'earth? God seemed a great way off, and his: ownt proud heart rose in revolt, and drove him fromt his: knees.   When; he arose the next morning, those doubts' ha had: fed, and his convictions returned anew. Heel knew there must be a reality in religionm. He could not: doubt" that his: parents and sister were Chris- tiste,:^and he ktie;t that William and Nellie pos- sessed a peace and joy:to' which he was' astottge    SORIPToRAL sAPTXiS.  ,   2 Still a strange apathy seemed :to overcome and-hold him back, and this very apathy was a cause of deep alarm to him. He felt that he needed counsel and sympathy. His relations to William and Nellie were such that he felt a greater freedom in opening his mind to them than to any one else. William had left for the seminary, but Nellie understood his feel- ings and would sympathise with him. He therefore sought an interview with her. He unbosomed all his feelings to her, told her of the doubts that thrust themselves upon him, and of his anxiety to have the great question of lis relations with God so adjusted that he might feel the same peace and joy that she and William evidently possessed. "And now, Nel. lie, I come to you for the counsel and sympathy that I know I should find in William if he were here. O, Nellie, I would give worlds if I could possess the same calm assurance of the Divine favor, and the same peace and love that I believe you enjoy." This free opening of his heart was followed by a flood of tears. Nellie took his hand gently in hers, and said: "James, Jesus loves you infinitely more than your best earthly friends possibly can. If you will go to him in the same confiding spirit that you come to me, you to, shall feel the same peace and love that makes life so calm and .sweet to me." "Oh, I want tQ cowme, and I want to come w ^o,"'. said Jaes, the tears still ow foin r el r"Will you not pray for me, NellieP"   252      THE JUDD FAMMTi Y They knelt, and Nellie poured forth her full soul in quiet, earnest prayer for her friend. She told her Savior of his deep sorrow for sin, and of his desire to lead a new and holy life. She plead her Savior's love for sinners; of the travail of His soul for their deliverance, and His promise that none who come in penitence shall be turned away, or fail of mercy. "He comnes, dear Jesus, a lost sinner to Thee. He comes now just as he is, and lays him- self and his all at Thy feet. If Thou didst die for him, O speak the word and bid him live." James went with Nellie in every confession and petition, and made them his own. His heart was melting, and when he breathed forth the sentence: "Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee," he felt the burden roll from his heart, and a sweet peace, with such love and joy as he had never felt or dreamed of before, filled and bathed his soul. He seemed to have come into a new life. He was born of the Spirit-he was born again, and his cries for deliv- erance were turned into thanksgiving and praise. That was the day of days to James-to be noted and kept hereafter, as-his birth-day into the King- dom. With a heart overflowing with love, and a countenance beaming with gladness, he thanked Nellie for her interest and prayers in his behalf, and bidding her an affectionate farewell, he hastened to his father's house, to break the glad news to his parents. t .    SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     253 OHAPTER XV. HE NEXT morning after his conversion, James I summoned courage to break the joyful news to his parents. This was entirely unexpected to them, for he had not ventured to open his mind to them on the subject, and they were almost incredulous as to its reality. They did not, therefore, manifest the joy James supposed -they would. This was, a great trial to him. He felt the want of sympathy, and since he did not find it at home, he sought it in the family of Mr. Judd. There he found in Mr. and Mrs. Judd, and Nellie, warm, sympathizing friends. They entered at once into his feelings, and were ever ready with words of encouragement and hope to aid him on his way. In Nellie, especially, he found a sister, whose words seemed to come with magical power to his heart. She seemed to understand, almost by intuition, his peculiar feelings in the new position he had taken, and her counsels were so wise 'and timely that they seldom failed to. bring relief in his trials, .   TaHE JUDD FAMLY Prom childhood they had been school-mates till he left nome for college, and he had always enter- tained sentiments of esteem for her, but since his conversion he had learned to esteem her as he had never done before. Her Christian virtues possessed a peculiar charm for him, and her warm sympathy in his trials, won upon his regards till it seemed as though his life. was linked with hers. He felt a sense of loneliness when absent from her soety that he could hardly account for, and great pleasure in the prospect of spending an hour in her com- pany. What did it mean? Was It love, and was he really in love with Nellie ?  It must be so; or why should he feel as he did? And then the ques- tion arose:  Was this love reciprocated, and did she feel any other sentiments toward him than those of Christian esteem ? At first he tried to dismiss the matter as a mo- mentary feeling that would soon pass away, and endeavored to banish it from his mind; but, like the ghost in Hamlet, "it would not down." It fol- lowed him from day to day, till finally he made up his mind to open the subject to Nellie, and make her the offer of his hand. In a few days more he would return to his studies in college.  He was anxious to have the question settlel before he should leave. If he could know that Nellie reciprocated his love, and would   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.   255   consent to be his at some future day, his mind would be at rest, and he couLa pursue his studies more contentedly., With this object in view, the day but one before he left he sought an interview with Nellie. He re- counted the struggles he had passed through in regard to her, told her of his love, and made the formal offer of his hand. Nellie listened quietly to his proposal, and. then assured him of her feelings of esteem, but feared there Vras one insuperable barrier in the way. It' is this," said Nellie.  "'You will probably wish to unite with the Baptist Church, as your parents belong there, and its rule of restricted com- munionc would shut me away from the Lords Sup- per, and the same rule would prohibit your com- muning with me. I thinl that husband and wife should, if possible, belong to the same Church, at least they should be able to go to the commuqnion table together. With my present views of Baptism, I could not unite with the Biaptist Church. :They Would not receive me without Baptisii  by immer- sion, and I could not consent to a re-Baptism, and especially by immersion.  So James, I think you had better dismiss the subject entirely from your mind.":' "But" Nellie," said James,  don't you think im- mersion valid' Baptism l"'   256 6      THE JUDD FAMTFLY. O "So far ass mere validity is concerned, I have no doubt ot it. If others think immersion to be right for them, I think it their duty to obey their own convictions. But James, the seal of the cove. nant is upon me. I could not add to its obligations by a re-Baptism; and I would not throw doubt upon my first Baptism by submitting to a second." "As to that," said James, "I see no difficulty in the way. So far as close communion is con- cerned, I shall never unite with a Church that will not let my wife commune with me. I had had this matter under advisement long before I gave my heart to my Savior as I now, in a subordinate sense, propose to give it to you, I must say that I am as much opposed to it as you are. I regret to part company with my own dear parents; but I cannot on their account shut myself out from fellowship and communion with my fellow Christians of sy Church."  "I should be very unwilling to be the occasion of your parting 'company with those who must be dear to you by the sacred ties of relationship," said Nellie. "In this case you will not be, dearest Nellie," said James, with evident emotion.  "That matter is fixed whether you accept of my hand or not." Nellie, in turn, was deeply moved. If she should accept of his offer and he unite with the Church of   SRUIKTURAL BAPTISM.      257 her choice, would she not be accused of drawing him' away from the Church of his father's choice? And yet she knew that she loved James, though she had studiously sought to conceal it. She finally answered: "There should be harmony of sentiment between husband and wife upon all doctrinal opinions in- volving duty, and I fear there is a great gulf be- tween us on the subject of Baptism in its various aspects. Would it not be well to defer the final settlement of the question till, in this respect, we can ascertain the points of harmony and disagree- ment between us?" This was a new thought, and it involved a point too delicate to name.   James felt its force, and replied: "Have you thoroughly examined the points of difference between the Baptist and the various pedo- Baptist Churches, Nellie?' Nellie replied that she had. "Then I suppose your opinions are settled upon that question," said James. "They are," was her reply. "Well Nellie," said James, "I freely admit that with me it is not. I have first impressions, it is true; but perhaps they may be wrong. I have never really examined into this question of Baptism. But I have this to say, that if you accept my hand, I The Jud Famllj '  1     .     ,   2b8      THE JUDD FAMLY., ill never stand in the way of any duty you may- think yourself called upon to perform, And I fur ther pledge to examine the question of Baptism, in all its bearings,. under your tuition." "Oh! I could not ask that much," said ,Nellie, with a smile. "And then, too, I fear I should mak  rather a poor teacher." "Well then, I will place myself under the tuition of your brother William," said James. "I know th'at he is competent to teach me, for I have found out'his familiarity with that subject in a little de. bate' with him more than six months ago; and it , was then that my confidence in Baptist opinions was first shaken'" Nellie's 'objections were all silenced. She, there- fore, made no reply. James saw that she wanted to give" himan anffirmative answer, though from feel- ingos of delicacy she hesitated. So taking her hand he said: ' Nellie, my happiness and usefulness for this life are largely in your hand. I will not say, like some foolish lovers, that I cannot live without you. My higher happiness flows from a consciousness of the lodvirigfavor of our Redeemer. With His smile the fountain of my life remains. But if you pledge me' your hiand you will give new inspiration to my life and I can then return to my studies contented and 1   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM. * Nellie looked up into his face, and a tear started in her eye as she oaid/: "James, marriage is a sol- emn thing, and it should not be entered into with- out due consideration. I need time to think and pray over the subject, and also to consult the larger experience and more mature judgment of my parents. But this much I will say,  I have taken much pleasure in your company, and should it seem the will of our Heavenly Father, I know of no reas why I cannot give you my hand. Will this answer satisfy you?" "Most certainly, Nellie.  I can ask no more? and I prize you the more highly for your sterling good sense in the matter." With this understanding James returned to his studies at college, hopeful and happy. We need not detain the reader with the detail of James' experience after his return to college. Suffice it to say, the question of his future Church relation was frequently in his mind. 'Nor will it seem strange that he should feel some anxiety when we conider his early traimng.  Hp remRebrp ed too, the pledge he gave Nelie to examine the ques- tion of Baptism under William's tuition. With the view, therefore, of setting this ques- tion at as early a date as possible, he pennedie following letter:   260        THE JUDD FAMLY. DERA WIrIAM: You have learned through Nellie the joyful news of my conversion. Yes, the question is settled. I have found the Savior. Jesus is mine, and I am His. Oh! the peace, the- joy, the bliss of Divine love. My past life seems like a dark dream. But I am now living, as it were, in a new world, feeling the pulsations of a new life. I know you rejoice with me in this. And now I feel the importance of a public con- secration of myself to His service, and of taking upon myself the seal of the covenant-Baptism. But my mind is not set- tled as to the proper mode. You have taught me to look beneath the surface, and have unsettled my faith in immer- sion as the exclusive mode. And since so large a class of deeply devoted and intelligent Christians differ so widely with the Baptists, I feel it due to myself, before I decide upon the line of my duty, to examine into the grounds of their belief. With this end in view, I wish to get your opinion upon the following questions: 1. The points of difference between John's Baptism and Christian Baptism. 2. Why was Christ Baptized? and is it proper to say, Ufollow Him in Baptism?" 3. What was probably the mode of John's Baptism, and was the mode the 8ame in Christian Baptism? Please also to give your views upon the question of In- fant Baptism; and if you think it taught in the Holy Scrip- tures.         Your Friend and Brother, JAMES WiLMOT. The following is William's reply: DEAR- JAaMS:- You can imagine the joy it gave me to learn, as I did, through sister Nellie's letter, of your conversion so soon after   SCRIPTURtAL BAPTISM.        261 I left home. Your letter, just received, serves to swell the joy. Yes, dear James, there truly is a fulness of bliss in the felt experience of Divine love that no words can express. It is, no doubt, your duty to unite with some branch of the general Church; but you alone can decide which. You ask me to give my opinion upon several questions propounded in your letter. I almost hesitate to reply to your inqiuries, lest I should seem to dictate your faith. In com- plying with your request, therefore, I shall do it with the disu tinct understanding that you do not rely on my opinion, but go directly to the fountain of infallible Truth, the Sacred Scriptures, and draw your opinions from that blessed Book. If my suggestions can aid your inquiries I shall be fully re- paid in the consciousness of service rendered to a friend. Your first inquiry, "The points of difference between John's Baptism and Christian Baptism," will, in my opinion, be found in the following particulars: 1. John's Baptism was a solemn pledge of rpepntancs and reform to all who received it, in view of the near advent of the Messiah. It was a preparatory dispensation. It was,- therefore, called "The Baptism of repentance," 2. Christian Baptism embraced more than this. It was a profession of faith in Jesus of Nazareth, as the promised Messiah. Emmanuel-God with us--and was, therefore, a sol- emn covenant transaction, in which we consecrate ourselves to the service of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Christian Baptism, therefore, covers the ground of repentance, but goes far beyond it, as its formula clearly indicates. Your second question, "Why was Christ Baptized," etc., I deem an important one. In the first place, though Baptized by John, He did not- receive John's Baptism; for, as the Messiah, He had no sia   262        ti JUDD m? FAi'. to epentt of, and needed no form. H Baptis m wqs, there fore, distinct in its object and character. In the second place, it was in obedience to the Levi,tioal, or ceremonial law. Christ was a "priest after the order of Melchisedec," or a priest out of'the order of Aaron, but still a priest, The law required that a man should be set apart to the office of priest till the age of thirty years; and it was a part of his consecration to receive asacrqd washing, or Baptism. This law is recorded in Exod. xxmx, 4: "And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with woaer." The subsequent verses describe the other steps in this process of consecration, and the seventh verse gives the last, or crowning act, in these words: "' Tlen -thou shalt take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him." Moses tells us, Numbers vil!, 7, how this washing was performed:  "And thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse then. Sprinkle water of purifying upon them." In this connection we notice the following facts.: 1. John was himself a priest in the regular Aarpnic line, and therefore authorized to consecrate other priest0, 2. Jesus went at the age of thirty, not before. He went to efter upon his priesthood in obedience to this very law. 3. He received the higher anointing of the HolyS pi"rit which descended upon him in the form of a dove; and all this bemuse " it became him to fulfill all (the) righteousness of the law." You are now prepared for the answer to the Second part of your second inquiry,-"Is it proper to folloto Ori t in Baptism?' He was no more an example for us in HiS Bap- tism tEin h e ewas in Hiss crucifixion. We cannot follow Him in His Baptism, upless we are to become priests aJ He   S(tlPTUBAL BA PTis M.? '1M was. But the office of the priesthood centered and had its fulfillment in Him. To your third inquiry--"What was probably the mod of John's Baptism," etc., I answer: As the law required the Baptism of a priest to be by sprinking, John would hardly depart from the letter of the law in Baptizing Jesus. It is, therefore, probable that though in Jordan, it was with water, and by sprinkling Now James, you know enough of the Greek preposi- tions to be familiar with this fact, that en is more frequently a note of place than of manner, and that apo htudatos is more properly rendered from the water, than out of the wate. Nbw if Jesus was not Baptized by immersion (and there is nothing in the language to justify anything more 'than a possibility), then it is not probable that any of the multi- tudes Baptized by Him were more than sprinkled. You Will ask me, if John did not Baptize'by immersion; whyr did he go to Jordan to Baptize.? I answer, there isno evi, dence that he went there on purpose to Baptize. "' He came' preaching in the wilderness of Judea." And you'know that' in all that region, there is no water only as the Jordan runs- through it. John would therefore use the water of Jordan whether he was to Baptize by sprinkling or immersion. And then, too, the vast multitudes that attended his rmin- istry would need much water for themselves and beasts to drink, had there been no Baptism at all. The same is true of the mich wateur at Anon. You know that the Greek word peoa means: any instead of mWch. In agreement with this, travelers tell us that "Enon is a place abounding in springs' of'water," and is, therefore, a place of many waters; I hardly need refer to the Baptism of the eunuch by Primp, Acts vm, 88, $9. The force of the Greek pt6eositidns are   264       THE JUDD FAMLY. the same in this case as in the Baptism of Christ. But even admitting that Philip and the eunuch went down into and came up out of the water, there is no proof of immer- sion in the case; while the probabilities are against it. The passage in Isaiah from which the eunuch was reading, com- mences at the 13th verse of the fifty-second chapter and runs through the fifty-third chapter. In this passage the prophet describes the sufferings of Christ in His atoning work, and the glory that should follow. "So shall he sprinkde many nations," verse 15, chap. LI  This doubtless had allusion to the, ancient mode of purifying by sprinkling. Philip in preaching Christ to the eunuch, no doubt explained his as referring to Christian Baptism, for while Philip was thus expounding the passage, "they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" etc. I am aware, James, that you have always been taught that this passage is proof of immersion; but where the proof is, I have never been able to see. If going into and coming out of the water is proof of immersion, then Philip as well as the eunuch was Baptized. Now the probability is, they went down out of the chariot to or into the water, as a matter of convenience, and when there, Philip Baptized him in the manner spoken of by the prophet-by sprinkling. (Isa. LH, 15.) I fancy, now, that your mind is passing to what you think strong passages for immersion, Rom. vi, 8, 4, 5: "Buried with him by baptism into death," and Col. H, 12: "Buried in baptism." To get the real teaching of these passages, we need to raise and answer two questions: 1. Into what were they bwkied   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.        266 2. By what agent or instrument were they buried? The burial was into death, and not into water, and the agent by which this burial is accomplished is Baptinm. Now James, your mind is too logical, not to see that the Baptism and the burial are not the same. They stand in the relation of cause and effect. To say that the Baptism and the burial is the same, is to confound the ageit with his work. The burial is the result of the Baptism, and- the result would be the same whatever the mode of its application. The Baptism spoken of in these passages buries into death; a result never attained by water Baptism, which is not, therefore, referred to in these passages. Now what is not true of water Baptism, is true of the Spiritual Baptism. The pas- sage is metaphorical; and we are crcified with Christ in the same sense that we are buriel with Him. This is the Bap- . tism spoken of by John, in reference to Christ: "He shall Baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire." I have been surprised at the shallowness of the reasoning that can find any allusion to the mode of Baptism in the word buried, since the burial is simply the result of the Baptism, and not the Baptism itself Now, since water Baptism is the type and symbol of the Spiritual Baptism, the logical conclusion is, that the mode is the same in either case. Since, therefore, the Spiritual Bap- tism comes by a pouring'out and falling upon, it is obvious to my mind that the water should come in the same way; for it isobvious that the sign should agree with the thing signijf . In agreement with these views, you will find that all the metaphors of Scripture, in reference to Baptism, favor pour- ing and sprinkling, and never immersion. Thus: "He shall come down upon them like rain upon the mown grass." And   t66        THE JUDD PAWYM               again; '"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean."  In conformity with this idea, all the rites of purifcation among the Jews were by sprin7ging, and not one by immer- sion. On the other hand, all those terms that affiliate with g immersion, when used in a metaphorical sense, express dis- aster, distress and ruin. Thus: plunged in distress, sunk in ! despair, overwhelmd in trouble, immersed in worldliness  and sin. And now, dear James, in regard to your third inquiry, ,about Infant Baptism. If I were to give you my views, you might not think them of much weight. It is a question in- volving the consideration of so many facts in its proper solu- tion, that, if I was able, I could not do the subject justice in j uthe brief space of a single letter But since you request it, I will suggest a few leading thoughts, which you can take up and investigate at your leisure. 1. It is said by those opposed to the Baptism of infants, that "there was no instance of Infant Baptism recorded in the; New Testament, nor any command to Baptize them," and *that ts silence of the New Testament is against it. To this I oppose the inquiry, Is it anywhere forbidden in the New, Testament? In like manner, female communion is no where mentioned in the New Testament. Is this silence any proof against it? You will at once say No. , In like manner, this silence is no proof against Infant Baptism. But, though it is not commanded in express terms in the New Testament, yet it is'in accordance with a great funda- mental principle, everywhere recognized in the Bible, viz.: That infants are linked with their parents in privilee and obgatin. In conformity to that principle, children were once made members of the visible Church; and the seal of   SchrifPTdAL BAPTISM.       27 the ovtenant, which is the seal of obigation- And 0rige, placed upon them by the command of God. And now, since the Church of God is ONE and the same in all ages, it follows that, until that law is repealed, chil- dren should be regarded  and treated as members of the general Church, and the present seal of the same covenant placed Upon themi viz.: Baptism. In this view it will be seen that the practice would run  right on, into the New Testament Church, unless prevented by express command. It was not so prevented, and there- fore, ran on into the New Testament Church, and has come down to our times in unbroken succession, meeting with no opposition and evoking no controversy for the first thirteen hundred years of the Christian Era, and historically recog- ' nized by the early Fathers of the Church, such as Justin Martyr, Irenseus, Origen, Augustine, and Pelagius, as a practice that came down to them by the command of Christ and His Apostles. And now, dear James, if you ask, what good it can do to Baptize an infant, I answer, The same that it does to Baptize an adult; and the same that it did to circumcise Abraham's children. True believers are children of Abra- ham. "For if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abrahamn's seed and heirs, according to the promise." That promise was, "I will be a God unto thee and thy seed after thee." The covenant that God made with Abraham in connection with this promise had Christ for its central figure. It was THE Gospel covenant, and had circumcision for its seal under the first, or shadowy dispensation. But when Christ came and removed the shadows, circumcision passed away with them, as inappropriate to the new dispensation; but Baptism has been retained in its stead-just as the lamb in the Pascal   268       THE JUDD FAMLY. Supper was laid aside, and the bread and wine retained,  constituting the Lord's Supper. These suggestions are brief and very imperfect, but I  will refer you to the Rev. Mr. Truman, for a more full and thorough statement of the arguments in favor of Infant Baptism, Hoping that you will go down to the bottom of this subject in your investigations, and that God will guide you to a clear apprehension of the Truth, I am, dear James, Your Affectionate Friend and Brother, WILT TTAM JUDD.   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      269 I                     , CHAPTER XVI. ILLTAM'S letter to James, in answer to his inquiries in regard to Baptism, -was duly re- ceived while at college, and many of his spare hours were devoted to an investigation of that sub- ject. Silently his early prejudices gave way, one by one, and he came to take a broader and more spiritual view of the ordinance. False assumptions were seen as such, and given up; and the analogy between water Baptism, as the outward sign and  symbol,. and the Spiritual Baptism it was designed to symbolize, was seen and felt, more and more. And the result was, that, as the Spiritual Baptism comes by a " pouring out" and " falling upon," "as rain upon the mown grass," so he saw and felt that the water Baptism should come in the same way. But in regard to Infant Baptism, though his feel- ings were somewhat modified in reading the few suggestions contained in William's letter, yet it was not till after the close of his college course and his return home, that he made "a thorough investigation of it                       *   %c0       THE JUDD FAMLY. William too, was at home spending his vacation. They were often together, and sweet were the corn- munings of the two young' friends, as again. they wandered in the shady grove, or fished ill the crystal lake; and many precious seasons of prayer did they  have together, their souls being bathed and filled with the love of-Christ. One afternoon, a few days before William was to return to his studies at the seminary, James called and requested him to take a walk down to the parsonage at the corners4 and as he was at leisure, he went with him. But it was not till they had been invited into Mr. Truman's study thait James made known the object of his call.  Mr.  E Truman and William were both taken by surprise when James requested that good man to give his  reasons for Baptizing infaints. William stammered  out an apology to Mr. Truman for being with James on such- an errand, that he did not know of the object of the visit till James announced it,. James took the entire responsibility of the call upon, him- self, and yet said it was at Willian"s suggestion that he had called. Willianm and Mr. Truiian Were puzzled. to see how that, could be, till Jatnmes referred to William's lettei. to him over six months before. Mr. Truman then went into a full analysis of the subject; practically advancing the same arguments that he had to Mr. Judd several years before. These   SCRIPTURAL BAPTSM.      2l1 facts, arguments, and illustrations wereso:clear and convincing that every doubt was removed from James' mind, and he announced himself a believer of pedo-Baptist principles. On their way back, James said to William: "The proofs for Infant Baptism are so plain and forcible, it really seems strange to me that I have not seen them before." "Not strange in the least to me," said William, "considering the style of influence under which you were trained from childhood; and then too, these proofs do not lie upon the surface, and are not no- ticed by many, till they are unfolded by examina- tion and study. Before they parted, James told William that it was his wish to unite with Mr. Truman's Church*; and as the next day was the time for the prepara- tory lecture and Church meeting, it was arranged that he should attend and offer himself for that purpose. Great and general was the surprise of the old members of the Church, when, on the following day, James offered himself to the Church; but so marked was the change in his spirit and deportment, that no one doubted the genuineness of 14s conversion, and it was voted unanimously,to receive him. As the following Sabbath was to consumate :is union with the Church, he thought it his duty t?; ty   , 72      THE JUDD ,AMTT Y.   inform his parents of the step he was about to take. He broke the matter to them in a round-about way, lest the revulsion of feeling should be too great. He told them, of the deep love he always bore them, and his love was never more ardent or genuine than now; and of the regret he felt that the step he was about to take should give them pain, but his con- victions of duty were clear and distinct. The Mas. ter had said, "He that!oveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." He would love  them still, and their Christian communion, so far as he was concerned, might still be sweet. If he could not come to the communion table with them it would not be his fault. He loved them, but he loved all the Lord's children too, and in regard to Chris- tian communion he could not consent to unite with a Chnrch which made it a disciplinable offense to commune with other branches of the Church. His mother wept profisely, for James had always been her idol. Slhe had been alwabllindly attached to the peculiarities of the Baptist Churqhes, and this denominational attachment had blinded her to the real excellencies of other Church; hence, it seem- ed to her almost like his deserting the Savior. That was a deeply interesting scene, when, on the next Sabbath, at the close of the morning ser- vice, James presented himself at the altar of con- secration. Mingled feelings of joy and sadness   - I ?n            '           * SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.      273 pervaded his heart. The only member of his father's family present was his sister Susan, and the big tears were coursing down her cheeks at the thought of the step James was taking. He was in one sense "forsaking father and mother, and brother and sis- ter for Christ." But Oh t such a peace as pervaded his soul, as he stood at that altar of consecration and took upon him the vows of God; taking God the Father for his God, and the Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior, and the Holy Ghost as his sanctifier and guide; and when the water of consecration was poured upon him, he seemed to sink away out of self into God, and such a flood of light and love filled his soul as he had never felt before. Surely, "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his covenant." We will now pass over the lapse of two years. James has completed his law studies, and has es- tablished himself in a good business in a growing city in another part of the State. William, too, has - completed his theological course -at the seminary, and has received a call to a Church in the same  city, which he has accepted. And should we step behind the screen, we would find that James was a quiet agent in his settlement there. A year later, and on the anniversary of James' conversion, a joyful company are gathered at Mr. Judd's. Mingling in that throng are Mr. and Mrs. The Judd Family.  18   274       TIEH JUDD FAMLY. Wilmot and their family, all clad in smiles. Mr. and Mrs. Alvord and their family are there also, joyous and smiling. William is also there, and from the style and character of the preparations, it is evident that a double wedding is on hand.  The nuptials between James and Nellie are to be cele- brated, but who is to be the bride of William? It is no less than the beautiful and accomplished Evangeline Alvord.  Mr. and Mrs. Truman are there, with hearts overflowing with sympathy and love. Mr. Bennett is also present to assist in the nuptial ceremonies. A great change has taken place in that commu- nity within the last year, showing, the progress. of the world toward Christianity. Mr. Bennett had long been investigating the grounds of restricted communion, and the practice had been growing more and more distastefull to him; so much so, that after James had united with the Congregational Church he felt constrained to give expression to his views in a course of lectures on that subject. The final result was, that his Church, by a unanimous vote, expunged that one feature from their Articles of Faith, and like the most of the English Baptist Churches, and like Mr. Spurgeon's Church in Lon- don, had become open communion. Before his conversion, James had expressed a desire to see his father and mother at the oommuno   SCRIPTURAL BAPTISM.     275 ion table with Mr. Judd's and Mr. Alvord's families. The reader may, therefore, judge of the emotions of pleasure it gave him to see the three families all at the communion table in the Baptist Church, and Mr. Truman assisting Mr. Bennett in that sacred ordinance. The language of the Psalmist came to his lips, "How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down, to the skirts of his garments.' As the dew of Her- mon, and as the dew   that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life forevermore.1" We need   only add, as a fitting close to this narrative, that Willian, with his beautiful and de. voted Evangeline, is constantly rising in the affection- ate regards of his people; and the circle of their influence and usefulness is constantly enlarging. Their influence among the children and the poor of their parish is almost unboundede He often visits them  at their homes, and his affectionate solicitude for their welfare, temporal and spiritual, and the words of counsel and comfort he gives, are winning their hearts more and more. James and  Nellie, too, are proving themselves worthy and honored members of society. James is known as the high-toned, honorable Christian law-   276      THE JUDD FAMTTLY. yer and peace-maker. He is also an active Sabbath School worker, and his place is seldom vacant in the prayer and conference meetings. William's influence over him is most salutary. James avows that if he ever arises to eminence in his profession, he will owe it to the habits of thor- oughness in study he formed while at college under the influence of William's example. The three families at home mutually rejoice in the growing prosperity and usefulness of their chil- dren; and while their heads are growing white with age, their Christian characters are rounding out into likeness with Christ, and into that richness and falness of Christian experience that abiding faithful- ness to duty is sure to bring. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot often speak, with deep regret, of their former views in regard to close communion, and wonder that they could be blind so long; and they are -more and more warm-hearted and charitable towardc Chris-  tians of other Churches. The three families often visit together, and talk over the scenes and incidents  of the past. Mr. and Mrs. Judd, in particular, often look back to that evening visit at Mr. Atkinson's; and, tracing the quiet influence of that visit upon them- selves and family, and through them upon others, they bless God for the Colporteur, for that "even. ing's visit," and for the good things that " came of it."

THERE are various facts bearing upon the ques- tion of Baptism in the history of the early. Christian Churches of the East with. the practices of those Churches at a later date, which could not well be given in the body of this work, of such gen- eral interest to the reading public, that we have thought best to embody them in a more condensed form at its close. And: Frst, An argument has been drawn for immer- sion, as the Apostolic mode of Baptism, from the' historic fact, that in the second and a few succeed- ing centuries, immersion was quite commonly ob- served in connection with that rite. The: opinions of Christian men at an age so near Apostolic times are certainly entitled to some credit-especially where those opinions do not conflict with, the re- corded statements of the Apostles themselves. There were sources of knowledge to them, outsider of the   280        APPNT,. . Apostolic writings, that must have been lost to us. They must have known with a good degree of cer- tainty, what was the Apostolic practice in regard  j to the mode of Baptism and connected ceremonies;  i[ and that knowledge must have guided their practice  in regard to all that was then considered as essen- tial to valid Baptism.  It is in view of such facts that great faith has been placed, and deservedly, in the historic state- ments of the Christian writers of that age, cor-m  monly called the Christian Fathers. But while a   just criticism admits their entire truthfulness as his- torians, very many of their theological speculations should be received with great caution and discrim- ination. It must be remembered that these Fathers:  of the Church, though great men in their times,   j were converts from either Judaism or Paganism;  in either case, they had been accustomed to an ex- ternal and pompous worship, and they had marked the power that brilliant ceremonials had upon the  sympathies and imaginations- of the great mass of-f the people, and what am power those ceremonials were, in the hands of the priesthood to control them. Though they had. embraced the Gospel and pro- fessed. faith in-:Jesus as the truie Messiah--the ea- petted "Deliverer; and though they had an appre- hension of the spirituality of a true Christian worship, yet; the spiri8t of the agei and. the influence and   APPENDIX.         281 habits of their early education would exert a silent influence to lead them  to place a superstitious re- liance upon the ceremonials of Baptism  and the Lord's Supper, and to make them as impressive as possible, thus to work upon the sympathies and im- aginations of the people. That such was the fact- in regard to Baptism there can be no reasonable doubt. We find them giving to the external rite, water Baptism, all the efficacy of the Spiritual Bap- i tism-making the symbol equal to the thing  signi- fied.  This must be so, if we rightly understand the I force of the terms they-employ, for they speak of being "regenerated by Baptism," to which the Ro- man Catholics still hold. The practice of trine im- mersion (dipping three times forBaptism), and of Bap- tizing persons naked-.lare unquestionably additions to the rite. So also, of having the person to be Bap- tized dress in white, as an emblem of purity. None of these were forbidden by any expressed injunction, and yet, they show the lurkings of that latent su-   ' perstition that formed the " mystery of iniquity," that ' even in the days of the Apostles began to work. It was this-spirit that gave to mere ceremonials such efficacy in their regards--that lifted them  out  - of their place-teaching symbols, and invested them with the power of a  mysterious grace.        ! Thus it was that all the incidentals of Christ'   " Baptism must be minutely followed. Christ went   282        APPENDIX. down into the water, and suffered a partial submer. sion at the time of his Baptism'. It was right and  proper, therefore, that they should follow him in a  partial submersion. Not that it was absolutely es-  sential to Baptism; because, if the candidate was  sick, or in such a decline as to endanger the health,  that part of the ceremony was dispensed with, and  its accompaniment, pouring, adopted, which was  considered all that was really essential, was per- formed.  It may be new to many of our readers; but it is an historic fact that afusion or pouring of water upon the candidate, was generally practiced in con-  nection with, or immediately after the immersion or  partial immersion of the candidate. Mr. C. Taylor,  the editor of Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible, who,  by the way, was a man of great research, in his work, "APOSTOLIC BAPTISM,' gives twelve fac-  similes of ancient sculptures or ornaments upon  church doors, and Baptistries of the early ages of the Church, representing Baptismal scenes. Six of the twelve represent the Baptism of Christ in Jor- dan; one represents the Baptism of Constantine the Great, by Eusebius; one the Baptism of Argilulfus and Theolinda, the King and Queen of the Lom- bardi; and three represent Baptismal scenes, where the partial immersion is omitted, and the rite per- formed by pouring, and one is a picture of an anu ,me  by otl g   APPENDIX.        283 cient bath. The following description of them, we think, will be found very interesting. The first is an ornament on the door of the great Church at Pisa, in Italy. Christ is-represented as  wrapped to the neck in the folds of some heavy fabric. On the ri;ght, stands John the Baptist, in  the act of Baptizing the Redeemer by pouring the  water from a shell. The scene is represented as taking place under the shade of a leaning palm tree.  On the left, two angels are represented observing the ceremony. Mr. Taylor says: "From the shape of the characters, it m1ust be of very ancient work.  manship. The motto upon it is 'BAPTIZAT.'   Ac- cording to the tradition current among the Pisans, it was brought from Jerusalem  by the Crusaders  about the commencement of the twelfth century." In this scene there is no representation of water, but on the contrary, everything indicates the absence  of0water, except what might be contained in a small  vessel.  The second is a picture taken from thIe Church  on the Via Ostiensis, at Rome.  This appears to  represent the Savior as standing above the knees in water, (though the water does not appear in the  picture,).while the Baptist stands on a rock, hold-   ing in his band a small shell 6r vessel, from which  he is pouring the water of Baptism upon the Savior's   head, and above the- head of the Redeemer is a    284,       ASiPENCIX. dove descending, and the usual rays of light and glory are being emitted. As in the first picture, two angel visitants are witnessing the scene. "The outside is a plate of brass covering a substance of wood. The figures are partly in relief, and partly engraved. Some of the hollows are inlaid with sil- ver. The door which it covers is dated 1070, but the plate is much older than the door; and, from the letters, it is manifestly of Greek origin, and of very ancient workmanship. The third picture is copied from the door of the Church at Beneventumn, which was one of the first cities in Italy where the Gospel was introduced. It represents the Savior as standing to the middle in the river, and the Baptist as standing on the shore, administering the rite by pouring the water upon his head, The segment of a double lined circle above, is shedding down rays of light--upon the scene -a company of angels witnessing the transaction. The fourth representation is of the center-piece of the dome of the. Baptistry at Ravenna, which building was erected and, decorated in 454. In this picture, John the Baptist is represented as standing on the bank of the river, holding in his right hand a shell, from which he pours water on the head of Christ, who is shown as standing. to his middle in the water. Above the Lord's head is shown a crown of glory, and the figure of a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The name JORDANN is written over the head of a mythological figure at the right, which,   APPENDIX.        .28 according to the customs of the ancients, represented that river. The fifth is a representation in Mosaic of the Baptism of Christ in Jordan, preserved in the Church in Cosmediu, at Ravenna, which was erected A. D. 401. In the center is Christ our Savior, in the river Jordan, immersed to the middle. On a rock stands John the Baptist. In his left hand is a bent rod, and his right hand holds a patera shell, from which he pours water on the head of the Redeemer, upon whom   descends the symbolic dove. The head crowfied with the usual rays of light and glory. On the left is a mythological figure with a palm branch in her right hand, and her left raised to express wonder and astonishment. The sixth fac-simile is of an ancient bath. The representation here given is of an article which might be moved from room to room. It is a broad flat basin, in the center of which is a smaller one to hold the water, while the outer one was to catch the water used and keep it fi'om flowing over the apartment-that once dipped up with the hands not being allowed, as at present, to fall back into the dish from which they washed. It is more than prob- able that there was such a bath in the house of Cornelius, in which he was Baptized, not by a total immersion, for this was impossible, but perhaps a washing or partial submersion, followed by the reg- ular administration of the rite by pouring.- Proba- bly, also, the Phillipian ailor, having used such a   286        APPENDIX. bath to wash the lacerated bodies of Paul and Silas, "straightway" used the same, or another of similar form, for the purpose of receiving Baptism from them. The bath, of which the fac-simile is a rep- resentation, is still extant in the celebrated Baptistry of Constantine, at Rome, near the Lateran, and has been used for Baptism from the earliest times. The seventh is a picture of a King and his Queen, in a large urn, or family bath, both in a sitting or squatting posture. On the left, stands a man in a military habit, pouring water on them from a vase. Attendants are around them witnessing the admin- istration of the ordinance. Mr. Taylor says: "From the dresses, they are Longobardi, who received Chris- tianity' through the influence of Theolinda, A. D. 591. It is the Baptism of Argilulfus, the King, and Theolinda, the Queen of the Longobardi, who occu- pied Beneventum in the sixth century. The eighth is a picture of the administration of Baptism in those early times, and prior to the rise of the Papacy, It depicts two candidates kneeling near a bath, from which the water is taken in a vase or pitcher by the administrator, and poured upon them. Here, then, Baptism was administered without any immersion, and by pouring only; otherwise those persons had previously been immersed, or washed, and afterward received Baptism as a dis- tinct subsequent and separate act.' :Either of these facts (and one of them must be true,) plainly shows   APPENDIX.    -    287 that poring was the mode of administering the or- dinance, the arguments of the Baptists to the con- trary, notwithstanding, The ninth is a representation of a Baptism out- side of a Church, but near it. It is the Baptism of a boy of eight or nine years of age. The officiating priest is, habited in a long white robe. The child is unclothed and stands in an erect posture, and the officiating priest, administers the ordinance by pour- ing the water out of a vase or pitcher. This picture shows that the present Abyssinian mode of Baptism was extant among the Greeks as well as among the Romans in ancient times. This plate is at Rome, but was the work of Greek artists as early as the ninth or tenth century. The tenth picture represents Laurentius in the act of Baptizing Romanus. This picture is in the Church of Lawrence, extra muros, at Rome.   It represents a Baptistry, and the administrator is Law- rence, the martyr preacher. The vase used in Bap- tism is remarkable, being the same in form as in pic- tures of great antiquity. The action is pouring, the same as in the other pictures, with no immersion in the case.                      , The eleventh is a representation of the Baptism of Constantine the Great. The Emperor is in a bath, immersed to the middle, metaphorically called the "Laver of Regeneration," and Eusebius adds the proper rite, of Baptism bypouring water on the mon- arch's head.   288        ApjpEux. The twelfth, and lastv,f these pictures is in the small chapel of the Catacomb of Pontiavus, called the "Chapel of the Baptistry." Beneath the por- traits is painted one of those crosses, ornamented with precious stones, called Gemmatce, to. the arms of which are hung the symbolical characters of Christ, A (alpha), and 2 (omega). This is also the Baptismal scene of Christ, representing him as stand- ing partly submerged in the water, while on the bank, out of the water, stands John the Baptist, with a shell or small vessel in his right hand, from which he pours the water of Baptism upon the head of the Redeemer, while, from above descends the dove with outspread wings. A lamb is introduced on the left, at the bottom of the picture, in allusion to the "Lamb of God," while directly above it is seen a single angel. Every circumstance connected' with this picture shows it to be of the mdst remote antiquity. We have thus presented our readers with eleven examples of Baptism, all administered by POUiRIG. And it must be remembered that these are examples occurring as early as from the second to the- sixth century. And now what are the lessons they teach? Here are lessons offact, and lessons of inferece.  The lessons offact are: FIirst. That all these Baptisms were by POURIN G Second. In several of them the persons Bap- tized were partially immersed, while none of them were totally submerged.   APPENDIX.         289 Third. In no case is the administrator in the water, but always on the bank. Fourth. In some of these instances the adminls- trators are laymen and not ecclesiastics. Fifth. Some of them were performed without any submersion at all. The lessons of inference are: First. We learn from these pictures what were the prevailing opinions of the Christians -of those early times. 1. That a partial submersion, repre- senting a washing of the body, was considered ap- propriate, but not absolutely essential. 2. That the mode was by pouring. Second. We infer from these pictures that they understood it as a historic fact, that while John Baptized Christ in the river Jordan, the Baptism was by pouring, and that John was not in the water at all; and so did not dip or plunge the Savior, for his attitude was not suited to such an act. In fact, a total immersion is out of the question. But these representations are in keeping with the New Testament history of Christ's Baptism. It was with water, which, according to these representations, John pours upon the head of Jesus, and the manner of its application agrees with the action of the Holy Spirit, which is seen descending in the form of a dove. It agrees also with numerous declarations of the New Testament record, where the action of the Holy Spirit is described at a pouring outs shedding forth, and falling upon etc., according to the pro- The Judd Famly.           . 1   2901        APPENDIX. phetic declaration, "He shall come down like rain." upon the mown grass." These representations serve also to explain what to so many minds has seemed dark and conflicting --the Baptism int water and with water at the same time. Mr. Booth, in his "Pedo-Baptism  Examined," quotes Deylingius, who says;  "So long as the Apostles lived, as many believe, immersion only was used; to which, afterwards, perhps they added a kind of AFFUSION, such as the GIreeks practice at this day, AFTER HAVING PERFORMED THE TRINE IN- MERSTON." There are two things in this quotation from Dey- lingius to which we call attention. The first is "as many believe." Who were the many that "believed" that immersion only was used by the Apostles? and on what evidence was that belief founded? We do not find it in the Apostolic writings, nor in the writings of the Fathers. The second is, "Perhaps they added a kind of affusion." "APerhaps' the argument lies in the con- tVary direction. Which was added the affusion, or the immersion. Again: Do the Greeks at this day add a kind of affusion or pouring, after immersion? Then they do not consider immersion as the whole of Baptism, but only as preparatory to it. This, is just as the Abyssinians perform that or- dinance, and "perhaps" they received this practice of pouring as the essential part of Baptism from the , i   APPD IXX.        291.  Apostles. How far may this "perhaps-"   be con- verted into a certainty? In attempting to answer that inquiry, we remark: The neaarr we can trace a practice to the Apos- tolic age, the more it justifies our reliance, and the greater uniformity we find among the various sects and different nationalities upon whatever is really essential to Baptism, the greater is the presumption that it came from the Apostles. If now we go to all the Christian sects of the East-the Egyptian, the Abyssinian, the Syrian, the Nestorian, the Greek and the Roman, we shall find none of them  em- bracing the idea that immersion is the whole of Christian Baptism, and if essential at all, essential only as a preparatory rite, to fit the subject for Bap- tism, while we shall find that all these branches of the ancient Christian Church practice pouring as the proper mode of its administration. There was, evidently, a distinction between im- mersion and Baptism. They were considered as two separate acts--the immersion as a kind of washing preparatory to Baptism proper, according to the lan- guage of St. Paul, "Having your bodies washed with pure water, and your hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." That such was -the case appears from the practice of the most, if not all the Chris- tian sects who trace their origin from the Apostolic age. Take, for instance, the Abyssinian Church. The Gospel was preached to the Abyssinians at an early date. History has it that, the eunuch, whom Philip,   the Evangelists, met and Baptized on his way back to Ethiopia, carried the Gospel to the Abyssinians. However this may be, the general diffusion of the Gospel among the Abyssinians, and the planting of Christian Churches is traced to a ]ater date. Says Mr. Taylor: "The Abyssinian Church de- rived its rites with its conversion from Egypt, A. D. 313." And hence its rites and practices in re- gard to Baptism may be expected to agree with those of the Churches of Egypt at that early day, while the near proximity of Egypt to Palestine, Rome, and Greece, would insure a uniformity in the general features of their practice in regard to Bap- tism. Are there, then, any remains of this separa- tion ibetween' :immersion and Baptism yet- existing in' Ethiopia at this day? There certainly are. The Abyssinian' records affirm that Queen Candace had, a palace at Axum, where those rites are still :practiced. Let us contemplate the rite as described by a British traveler who returned from there -a few years since. Mr.' Salt thus describes the fithceremony of Bap- tism as practiced- in Abyssinia, under the head, ' BAPTISiM OF A' MUSSULTMAN BOY:" "This ceremony took place at day-break; an early hour being "considered requsite, on account of thbe subsequent celebration of 'the communion, which can only be adrninistei'ed fasting. On reaching the Church, we found the head priest, Abou Barea, with about twenty priests of inferior order waiting 'in a smalli area;"about thirty yards from the spot; some   APPENDIX.        29 of them were engaged in chanting psalms, while the: rest were busy in preparing the water, and making other necessary arrangements for the occasion. "At sunrise, everything being ready, an attend- ! ant was sent round from the high priest to point out to each person concerned the part which he:was s to take in the ceremony. The officiating priest was habited in white flowing robes, with a tiara, or silVer-mounted cap on his head, and -he carried a censer with burning incense in his right hand. A second, of equal rank, was dressed in similar robes, supporting a large golden cross, while a. third held in his hand' a small phial, containing a quantity of, metron, or consecrated oil, which is furnished to the Church of Abyssinia by the patriarch of Alex- andria. The attendant priests stood round in the form of a semi-circle, the boy being placed in: the. center, and our party ranged in front. After a fewl minutes' interval, employed in singing psalms, some' of the priests took the boy, and .washed him all over very carefully, in a large basin of water. While this was being done, a smaller font, called, me-te-mak, which is always kept outside of the' Churches, owing to an unbaptized person not being permitted to enter the Church, was placed in; the middle of the area filled with water, which the priest consecrated with prayer, waving the incense repeat- edly over it, and dropping into it a portion of the-:- meiron, in the shape of a cross..- The boy-was then brought back dripping from head to:foot, and placed   294  '       PENDIX. again, naked and upright, in the center, and was required to renounce "the devil and all his works," which was performed by his repeating a given for- mula, four separate times, turning each time towards a different point of the compass. I named the child George, when I was requested to say the Belief and the Lord's Prayer, and to make much the same promises as those requiled by the Church of Eng- land. The head priest afterwards laid- hold of the boy, dipping his own hand into the water, and crossed him over the forehead, pronouncing at the same moment,' George, I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.' The whole company then knelt down and joined in reciting the Lord's Prayer. Here the ordinary ceremony of Baptism concludes, but as the boy had been a Mussulman, he was crossed with the consecrated oil over every joint of his body.  After this he was wrapped in a clean white linen cloth, and placed for a moment in my arms, the priest telling me that 'I must henceforth consider him verily -as my son. The -high priest did not take any active part in this ceremony, but the whole was Jconducted with a great deal of de- corum and solemnity. The boy, afterwards, accord- ing to the custom   of the most of the Eastern Churches, was admitted to partake of the holy commiunion." Here we have a clear and distinct separation between immersion and Baptisnm; and those con-,   APPENDI-.        29. versant with the subject, will readily recognize in Mr. Salt's description, the Baptism of a heathen, as performed in Egypt in the second century, by Ori- gen, or the other preachers. This description also illustrates Mr. Taylor's fac-simile No. 9, "Baptism outside of a Church," where the boy is naked, and the ordinance is administered by pourisng; and that plate, taken in connection with the above descrip- tion, shows that the present mode of Baptism among the Abyssinians, was extant among the Greeks, as well as the Romans, at a remote date. The following quotations from Mr. Taylor are so in point that we shall be justified in repeating them in this connection: "Monfaucon observed in the preface to his An- tiquite Expliquie, that we learn a thousand partiou- lars from  ancient .representations, sculptures, etc., concerning points of classic inquiry, which are not mentioned by any of the old writers. Robinson in his History of Baptism, introduced those ancient representations of that Christian ordinance, which he conceived might illustrate the subject. For these speak the same language to all nations. They pre- sent no difficulty of construction, nor' variation of sense in the, particles or prepositions. The learned and the unlearned, may translate them with equal facility., They are vouchers for the time in which they were executed; and though we cannot hear the men of that generation viva voe,: and we dare not put words into their lips, yet we may see-their   296     -   APPENDIX. testimony, and judge of its relevancy to the inquiry that engages our attention."  In this connection it will be of service to our readers to give a sketch of the leading branches of the early or Apostolical Church. The early Church was divided into the Hebrew, and the Syrian, or Gentile branches. The Hebrew Christians were exceedingly tena.- cious in regard to circumcision, and adhered to it in connection with Baptism, while the Syrian Church, which was mainly gathered from among the Gentile nations, did ,lot require circumcision. The primitive Hebrew Church extended through- out Judea, Egypt, and Abyssinia, and probably also eastward and southward of Judea.   The Syrian Church extended its branches throughout Syria, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Parthia, and into India. The early Churches of Italy and Greece, and, in fact, the early European Churches generally, were but an extension of the Syriac Church, which had its origin at Antioch, under the labors of the men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had reached that city, 'spake to 'the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus," "where "a great number"believed and turned  unto the Lord."  The Apostle Paul was called to aid in this good work, and spent a year at this point. A  very remarkable work was the consequence, and a strong- and powerful Church grew up, which subsequently extended its branches East, West, and North. M. Taylor says:   THE EGYTIAN CHuRmO. "The Egyptian Church, being of Hebrew origin, retains circumcision, but it Baptizes the children shortly after circumcision. This seems to have been the order observed by the Hebrew Christians gen- erally; circumcision being bound to time, but not so, flaptism. From the question proposed by Fidus to Cyprian, it may be conjectured that many Chris- tians in Africa adhered to this order of the rites, The deacons carry the children to the altar, where they are. anointed befoire Baptism; and this unction, they say, 'makes them 'new spiritual men.'" The manner of Baptism among the Abyssinians, who also practice circumcision, has already been related in the instance of Mr. Salt's Mohammedan Boy. As we have stated, the Abyssinian is a branch of the Egyptian, which is a branch of the Hebrew Church. THE SYRIAN CHURCH. It is not easy to ascertain the genuine practices of the Ancient Christian  Churches of Antioch. Wars and revolutions have destroyed-their authen.- tic documents and sculptures, but the habits of that Church must be gathered from the practices of those0 branches of it which remain, so far as we know them. The Georgians and the Iberians practice Infant: Baptism, in the name of the Trinity. The godfather Baptizes the child, the priest reading the Bapt-ismial' words, Baptism is conferred by m&nosioA -and -at:   r 298        APPENDIX. about the age of two years, and the child is an. ointed after the plunging. They hold that this anointing is the principal part of the ordinance. The Orientals, in general call this unction "the per- fection, of Baptism." "'Baptism is administered among the Armenians by immersion, and the officiating priest pronounces the words, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and plunges the child three times into the water, in memory of the Holy Trinity. Though our missionaries showed them their mistake in repeating the words at each immer. sion, there are many priests who still do it through mere ignorance. They Baptize only. on Sundays, if the child be not in danger of death; and the priest gives it always the name of the Saint of the day, or of him whose feast is to be for the day follow- ing, if there be no Saint for the day on which the Baptism is celebrated. The midwife carries the child to Church, but the godfather carries it 'home to the' mother with the sound of drums and trum- pets, and other instruments of the country. The Baptisms which are .administered on Christmas-day are the most magnificent, and they put off to that day the Baptism of those children whose state of health will permit it. The most famous are princi- pally celebrated in places where there is a large pond or river. For this purpose they prepare an altar in a boat covered with fine carpets; thither the clergy repair as soon as the sun rises, accom-   APPENDIX.        299 panied by the parents, friends and neighbors, fori whom they provide boats fitted and adorned in the same manner. Be the season ever so severe, after the ordinary prayers, the priest plunges' the child three times into the water, and performs the unction. The NlESTORIANS,.or Chaldeans, whose Patriarch takes the name of the Patriarch of Babylon, are a numerous body of Christians,- estimated at three hundred thousand families. They are spread through- out the East. They Baptize children. They use no holy oil in Baptism, but they use it afterwards as a kind of confirmation. The Jacobites, who inhabit the same country, and say they take their name from the Apostle James, practice both circumcision and Baptism. Dandini's "Voyage au Mont Liban," says: "The Maronites, of Mount Lebanon, as to what regards the sacrament of Baptism, do not 'preserve in the Baptismal fonts the water which 'has been sanctified on Holy Saturday for this service; but they sanctify it every time it is wanted, by reciting -a series of long prayers.  They plunge" the person receiving Baptism, three times into this water, or throw, a portionr of it over him three times. They pronounce but once the necessary form of words, and they give a name to the person at the same time. They use no salt, and they anoint, not only the head,- but also the breast, with the palms of the hands, which they hold open. They anoint also; the -shoulders with the front and back of the body, from head to   300        APPENDIX. foot. The godfather does not hold the child over the font, but the priest receives the child from the godfather,into a large linen cloth." It should be observed that Dandini was a Ro- man priest, sent by the Pope on a special commis. sion to this sect of Christians. He adds: "They are accustomned to delay Baptism, whether from -negligence or from some other cause, till the child is fifty or sixty days old." "The true reason, however, why the Maronites ;defer Baptism for this length of time, is because they consider the mother unclean during the time ; she keeps her bed; and the child would contract ceremonial uncleanness by remaining with the mother in that state, after having been ritually cleansed by ,Baptism." M"Mr. Newell, the American Missionary, who visited the": Syrian, Christians in India in 1814, says: 'I made particular inquiry respecting the MODE of apti'sm in the Syrian Church. I: found it was AF- FUsIoN. In the administration of this ordinance, :they mix cold andt warm water together. When I 'asked- them the reason of this, they seemed at aloss -for, an ,answer, and finally said it was because, Christ was Baptized in a part of :.the Jordan where another stream met with it. "Respecting the siubjects of Baptism, I Made no inquiry, as I .supposed it was ,a matter of notoriety that the Syrians-are P edo-.Baptists. .Brother Hall, -wh bo conv;ersed wilththose same priests when he was-   APPENDIXl at Cochin, ,undersood that :children were usually Baptized at eight years old." Is it too much to cPdnjecture that: those :distant countries to which Christianity penetrated, have re- tained the practices derive;ld fiorn their fore-fathers more punctiliously than the more perturbed nations of Europe and Western Asia? They have been less tormented with opposing opinions, and ambition has had less scope for its operations among them than among tmore extensive communities and interests. A slight sketch of their history may assist -us in forming a judgment of the antiquity of their rites. "A certain Theophilus arrived from India very young, among an embassy sent to Europe in the thirty-first, year of the reign of Constantine, A. D. 337. He returned to India in the character -of a missionary, A. D. 356, having staid nineteen years, during which time his conversion and instruction-in the Christian faith took place. His voyage was by the Red Sea, where he made some converts. Pro- ceeding to the Peninsula of India, he there found Churches already established. This seems to be the first mention of Christians on the coast of Malabar. Cosmos' Indicopleustas found them there A. D,. 540, and there the Portuguese found them in the latter ;end- of the fifteenth century, on their discovery of India. "This Church was of considerable standing -be- fore the visit of Theophilus. Its liturgy 1was then, as now, Syriac. The Bishop, till within these few   8:802       BAPPENDIX. years, was consecrated by the primate of Cetesiphon, the representative of the ancient Babylon. "The merchant fleets sailed in the times before Constantine, annually, to that coast from Egypt. It was by some of these that missionaries might easily proceed to India. This does not carry up the date of Christianity in that country to the days of the Apostles, though more than one of them, or their immediate disciples, are said, by good author. ity, to have preached- the Gospel in India. I have met with the mention of a Bishop in India, about A. D. 180. They are called Christians of St. Thom. as."--err's  Report, La Croz, Eusebiuzs. THE GREzEK CHURCH. We come now to the Greek Church, whose au. thority in favor of immersion, is strongly pleaded by the .Baptists, although -they deny their testimony in respect to Infant Baptism. Surely if their tes. timony is authority for one practice, it is for an other. It is impossible to account for the eorruption of that Church in Baptizing children, if thAt practice is a corruption. For it would, in that case, be a departure from fundamental principle. Nor can we account for it, only: as it was an original injunction, since no mistake could occur in the language used to describe it in the Scriptures, as this Church spoke the language in which the Scriptures of the New Testament were written, and that language is still the' vernacular of the country. But a variation   ;          .ArrPPDIX.        3C ':08 of the mode is not an infraction of any:fundamental principle, for whatever the mode- and its accessories, so long as the subjectis consecrated to'the Trinity in the use of water, the fundamental thought of Bap- tism remains. Nothing is easier than to perceive by what pro- cess they varied immersion into Baptism.  They have done no more than to take that which was' added after the Apostolic age, from literalizing that which was metaphorical, and finally of taking the added part for the whole, It is easy, too, to see how a partial submersion practiced at first as a matter of convenience, should finally run into a total submersion among an ignorant people, easily cap- tivated with parade and show. Immersion could be added just as Baptizing naked, dressing in white, and eating milk and honey, and also the practice of exorcism, anointing the body, etc.  There is always a latent superstition in ignorant, minds, and especially in a superstitious age which- attaches a mysterious grace to mere, ceremonials, just as ignorant people often wear a cross on their bosom or suspended to their persons to keep off wicked spirits. There is scarcely an addition to the primitive rite of IBaptism that is not supported by literalizing METAPHORICAL PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE. For instance the introduction of oil and anointing into the office of Baptism, is of extreme antiquity in the Church, but introduced since the Apostolic age, and passages of   30S .       APPgmDIX. Scripture may :be quoted in its favor; for was not Jesus Christ anointed at his Baptism? And why should not believers be anointed too, whose duty it is to be conformed in all things to their Head? Scripture authority may also be pleaded for the "clean white linen cloth," used as a garment; for are we not commanded to "put of' the old man with hisdeeds," which was- done in the previous washing, and to put on the new man? Toput on Jesus Christ, as signified by this white robe. An- ciently, also, the first food taken by the person Bap- tized was milk and honey;for does hot the Scrip- ture say, Isa. vzI, 15, the Messiah shall eat " but- ter"-the Eastern butter--" and  honey, that he may know to refuse the evil and to choose the good?" Can we, then, too closely imitate actions attributed to Jesus Christ? We thus see the consequences of adopting into the administration of a Christian ordinance customs gr6ounded on metaphorical expressions of Scripture. Do they furnish valid arguments for the practice? ' The sacrament of Baptism does not rest on such Suppers,: neither is it improved by the adoption of such similitudes.
