"It Is indeed a blessing when the virtues Of noble races are hereditary, And do derive themselves from the imitation Of virtuous ancestors." NABB'S COVENT GARDEN. THE golden orb of day had long kissed his adieu to Mount ID-- ; night's silvery queen came forth with her pale, soft light, illumining the shadows of the lengthy twilight, when two females stepped on the velvet lawn of an elegant mansion, in the county of A--, near the flourishing town of B---, in the north of Erin's green isle. So imbedded was it in the surrounding foliage of the extensive plan- tation of the domain, strangers not unfrequently were startled at their close proximity to the stately edifice, the owner of which had never seen fit to close the shady path which shortened the distance f   6 -MARIAN WALLACE. to B---.  There may have been something of pride :in allowing strangers to thread this labyrinth. Be that as it 'may, many a burst of enthusiastic admiration reached his ear, which, I doubt not, amply repaid him for any trifling inconvenience he sustained. As the ladies stepped forth, they were startled by a stranger, who apologized to the elder of the two for his intrusion, having lost the path which led to B---. She received his explanation, and pointed out the path he was in search of; while so doing, he had an opportunity of examining the countenances before him. Mother and daughter they certainly were. The elder was tall and ele- gantly formed, with a face of majestic beauty. She was a little past the meridian of life, yet, with an elasticity of step bespeaking a younger person. Pride and determination marked every lineament of her noble face. What shall I say of the younger?-that she was fairy-like in proportions? Peace and happiness sat enthroned on her speaking brow; confi1ing love beamed in her eye, as she turned those azure orbs to the face of her mother, whom she addressed with a voice sweet and low as an AEolian harp: "We shall miss the moonlight scene at the grotto, if we tarry  longer. Farewell, stranger." He received her adieu   MARIAN  WALLACE.       7 with a warmth of admiration, and a gallantry of manner which disconcerted the fair being. Blush- ing deeply, and hastily adjusting her scarf, which had become disarranged, she, with her mother, turned in the direction of the grotto. Mrs. Leslie, the queenly being before us, was the daughter of an East-Indian nabob, who was the younger son of a nobleman, with very little pros- pect of ever inheriting the ancestral estate. He sought in India to carve a name and wealth for himself. There he reaped a rich harvest; and to crown the darling wishes of his heart, he was beloved by one of the wealthiest heiresses of the land. But a prudent father feared to give his only daughter to the stranger youth, until he had tested the strength and purity of his principles. Nor was it long before he won the lady's hand, hei heart having long been his. ,Good and amiable, she was beloved by all; with a heart and hand ever ready to soothe the sorrowful, and alleviate the wants of suffering. humanity. Such were the par- ents of Mrs. Leslie. Ier husband, Mr. Leslie, was one of natured noblest works in the form of man; a soul fill{d with the purest and most honorable principles, ar- dent and generous to a fault. Such was he who won tie beautiful Amy Mortimer. Proud was he ',!   8      MARIAN  WALLACE. of his lovely bride. Not a little troublesome did he sometimes find her with her determination of spirit and hauteur of manner, which were displayed on every befitting occasion. Nor were they, "like angels' visits, few and far between." Many fair children climbed the knee of the fond father, and the eye of the proud mother kindled with love, as she gazed upon her beloved offspring. Though a gay and fashionable woman, Mrs. Leslie loved and cared for her children as much as a fashionable woman could. The sweetest flower that bloomed in the garden of her love, was Flora, whose blushing countenance left its impress on the trav- eller's heart. She was just in the bloom of girl- hood; life presented many a brilliant hue to her young imagination; she knew no world beyond the limits of her father's domain, where she lived in comparative seclusion, seldom enjoying the so- ciety of the mother she adored, whose time had been occupied in a more than usual round of gayety. A longer interval than usual had elapsed since Flora had been summoned from the side of her governess, to join her beloved mother in the drawing-room. Gladly her heart bounded at the joy- ful summons. Now for the long-promised walk to the grotto, towards which their tfaces were turned when they   MARIAN WALLACE.        9 were introduced to the reader. On their return from that romantic spot, they were joined by Cap- tain Bristow, a distant connection of Mr. Leslie's, from whom he always received a cordial welcome at Shirly Park, and, knowing the hospitality of its owners, he had presumed on that knowledge, and introduced a brother officer, whose wounds were scarcely healed, which he had received on the field of Waterloo, where he had signalized him- self by his valor on that memorable occasion. Mrs. Leslie hastened to welcome and reassure the stran- ger, whom she found discussing the tactics of the camp with her husband. In him she beheld the person to whom she had pointed out the path to i- B  , and whom Bristow had introduced as Ensign Stanhope. Nothing could have facilitated the aspir- ing ambition of young Stanhope more, than to be introduced and received as a visitor at Shirly Park. It gave him immediate entree to the fashionable world, the magic circle of which he had long sought to enter. Determining to avail himself of all the advantages which must necessarily accrue from this introduction, our hero had acted his part so adroitly, that ere the evening closed he had re- ceived a pressing invitation to prolong his stay, which was accepted by him with a dignified hu- m ility, evincing how highly .he appreciated the i - l   ro     MARIAN  WALLACE. honor. The angelic beauty of the daughter, as she stood by the side of her father, conversing with Bristow, aroused the dormant powers of his mind., With a lynx's sye, he watched the vary- ing emotions displayed by Bristow as he gazed on her youthful form, and beauteous face turned in- consciously to his admiring gaze. He read it all and profited thereby. Could that proud mother hale known that her hospitality would be abused; that he, a penniless adventurer, dared to raise his longing eyes to the face of the daughter that she guarded with so much care, would she not have spurned him from her presence? So perfect were his manceuverings when in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, that not a word or look betrayed the feelings with which he regarded the child she considered too young to participate in the gayeties with which she was surrounded. Flora longed for that day when she should be emancipated from the tedium of a school-room, which had become ex- ceedingly irksome ever since Stanhope had become a daily visitor within its proscribed walls. At an hour whPn least likely to be found there by Mrs. Leslie, even had she presented herself unexpect- edly, would she have found any reason for anxious thought, the time of his visits being wholly occu- pied in conversation with Miss Bankhead, nor by   X'   ,  MARIAN WALLACE.        U the merest accident, did he ever address Flora, yet not a change of her countenance escaped his no- tice; it was enough she was interested. The assid- uous attentions he bestowed on all by whom she was surrounded, and his entire disregard to her presence, piqued the conscious beauty, who in- herited the pride of her mother, blended with the more amiable qualities of her father. Fully had she determined when he next appeared in the school-room, to retire. Daily had she to endure a eulogy from Miss Bankhead on the elegance of the gentleman's manners, whom she considered void of common politeness. He was handsome and fas- cinating she must allow, but his rudeness to her- self was unpardonable. Stanhope had an intuitive 'knowledge of what was passing in her mind. Flora had no opportunity of putting her good res- olution in practice, as he absented himself alto- gether froim the school-room. Flora missed those visits. As Stanhope wished, she became restless and inattentive when the hour approached that she had been accustomed to hear his deep-toned voice in earnest conversation with Miss Bank- head. Had her mother been less occupied with the last Parisian mode, or the twiddle-twaddle of the drawing-room, would she have permitted these im-   12     MARIAN WALLACE. pressions to corrode and destroy the happiness of the child-? O mothers! if the record of these pages prove but a beacon to warn and alarm your fears for your daughters' future well-being and happiness, will you not forego the gratifications given to hours of transitory enjoyments lost in the vortex of fash- ion, in order that your presence may counteract the pernicious influences they daily imbibe, when their preceptresses have not the fear of God be- fore their eyes?               ; Stanhope made himself so necessary to the pleas- ure-loving Mr. Leslie, that his seat at table was scarcely ever vacated; even the haughty Mrs. Leslie looked benignly upon the young soldier, who, traitor-like, was betraying the confidence reposed in him, by pouring into the ears of their innocent child vows of eternal love, sanctioned by the unprincipled Miss Bankhead, whom he had bought to his interest. He cared not for Flora beyond the broad lands he knew would accom- pany her hand; he sought that hand merely as a means to liquidate the debts by which he was heavily bondaged,-he sought her only as the means of future, aggrandisement. Love wove no silken fetters around his supremely selfish heart. In after years her heart must sigh in solitude '*  '    . a ,   XjI MARIAN       WALLACE.      13 over a love she vainly thought she possessed; she knew not selfishness reigned supreme in the being her fancy had clothed with every lovable quality possessed by a finite being. Was there no arm to rescue that lovely and innocent being from the cold and selfish grasp of a libertine? Was there none to guard her from that living death-that of being a gambler's wife? None! Better to have plunged a dagger to its hilt in her innocent and guileless heart. So implicitly had she been taught to rely upon Miss Bankhead upon all occasions, never for a moment did she doubt the propriety of receiv- ing Stanhope's addresses. Led on- by this false de- lusion, every step but neared her to the maelstrom whose circling eddies were certain destruction to the hopes of her fond and loving parents. The halls of Shirly Park were thrown open to a gay and fashionable throng.  Miss Bankhead longed to get a peep at the masks, but Mrs. Leshe had strictly forbidden the appearance of Flora or herself in any part of the hall allotted to the guests; among whom were represented the beautiful Mary of Scotland, with her favorites; Darnly, Knox and his coadjutors; Elizabeth, with her court, revelling amid the hospitalities of Ken- ilworth; there they were displaying the grandeur of the sixteenth century.   Among the maskers   "     MARIAN WALLACE. were seen two blue dominos; the richness of their costume and the symmetry of their forms excited universal admiration. Mingling little among the dancers, whom they surveyed with apparent uncon- cern during the pauses in their own animated con- versation, if one might judge by their earnest ges- ticulations, as they leaned against one of the por- phyry pillars which supported the orchestra at the extremity of the ball-room, the swell of whose music prevented an eavesdropper from hearing the sub- stance of the conversation carried on between these two dominos. "Rudolphus, have yqu explored the building so as to be able to reach her apartment without fear of detection?" "Yes, sir, I have; yet I tremble for the conse- quences, her family being so influential-very dif- ferent from the last Quixote expedition you had the hardihood to acconmplish." "This, my dear fellow, is entirely of a different character-I intend to marry the damsel." "So you told me before." "Hearken, Rudolphus; there are broad lands attached to this, on which I will double the first promise." "Master Stanhope, your promises are very little dependence for a poor fellow who must suffer the   A      MARIAN WALLACE.         15 full penalties of the law if caught in the perpetra- tion of the act." "If the boat is. in readiness, and manned as di- rected, why, in the name of all that is lovely, need you fear? Surrounded as her parents are by this gay assembly, if discovered in the grounds shall we not be taken for-maskers enjoying the beauty of the illuminated walks? Go and' see if Bankhead has fulfilled the part assigned her, while I retire and change my doming, and join the dancers at this late hour in order to lull suspicion." Stanhope entered the ball-room, with Mrs. Leslie leaning on his arm, dressed in the uniform of his regiment. Many an eye flashed beneath the mask when he addressed some trifling badinage, con- vincing them of his knowledge of their identity. He was a general favorite among the ladies for his suavity of mnanners and beauty of face-they had flattered him until he considered himself a perfect Adonis. Flora and her governess were seated in the bon- doir of the suite of rooms allotted to their exclu- sive use; the strains of the distant music remind- ed them of the scenes then enacting,' and which they were necessarily debarred the pleasure of par- ticipating in. Miss Bankhead threw aside the book, the leaves of which she had been turning   16     [MARIAN  WALLACE. listlessly for the last half-hour, looking at her watch.  She asked Flora to take a stroll on the terrace, which commanded a view of the castle and fort, as they rested on the deep blue expanse, canopied by the firmament above, with its myriad of sparkling stars mirrored in the clear waters beneath, as they washed the sides of the strong tower which had so: gallantly defeated the project of the enemy from taking the town as they en- tered the harbor. Flora was too much engrossed in the book she was reading to heed Miss Bankhead's enthusiastic' admiration of the beauty of the night, and the serenity of the scenery. "Enjoy it yourself," dear Bankhead, "only leave me undisturbed to peruse Abelard and Heloise."  Flora knew the impos-  sibility of being joined then by Stanhope, though an ardent admirer of the works of nature and art. How long Flora remained alone she was unable to tell, until disturbed by the opening of the outer door. Supposing it to be her governess, she simply ques- tioned, "Is that you, Bankhead?" without looking up. It was answered in the negative, by a manly voice. Starting, she beheld a masked figure; her first impulse was to ring for assistance.- Recol- * ecting the occasion, which warranted such an ap- pearance, and presuming he must have mistaken   MARIAN  WALLACE.       17 the entrance, she rose to correct his error, and point out the way to that portion of the building devoted to the pleasures of the evening. He ad- vanced and presented a card, on the smooth, white surface of which was written: "He who adores you, waits impatiently for your presence at the hermitage, with Miss. Bankhead. The bearer will be your escort; trust him. STANHOPE." Flora's heart bounded to meet her lover, whom she had not seen for several lays. Throwing a valuable India shawl-which her mother had worn while reconnoitering the grounds, to see that all her orders had been punctually performed, with respect to the number of lights and their arrangement-' around her shoulders, she descended the steps of the terrace, escorted by whom, she could not tell; but Stanhope had told her to trust him, and with faith she relied implicitly on his word. With steps swift as the dear which bounded in her own loved lawn, Flora reached the hermitage, where she was clasped in the arms, and pressed to the bosom of Stanhope. Every thing was for- gotten in that blissful moment.  Uplifting her head from the bosom of her lover, she discovered   18      MARIAN  WALLACE. the absence of Miss Bankhead; this was accounted for by Stanhope assuring her that Bristow had persuaded her to take a row with him  on the  silvery waters, offering, at the same time, to guide her where Miss Bankhead was, if she would but enter the boat which was moored on the strand; he had no doubt they had stopped at the first inlet  to await their coming. "Rudolphus, return to the ball-room and ac-  count for my absence, while I bear Miss Leslie to her governess."  The dip of the oar ruffled the still waters over which they glided, distancing the home of her  childhood. As it receded from her siglt, might i she not have breathed a requiem over the peace and happiness which had crowned her days be-  neath those hallowed walls? Never again would  she be sheltered beneath that hospitable roof! I 1 I     MARIAN   WALLACE.         19 CIIAPTER   II. "Tempting gold alone, In this our age, more marriages completes, Than virtue, merit, or the force of love; 'Tis not th' external sweetness of the face, The inward excellence of a virtuous mind, The just behavior, the graceful mien, Can please the wretch whose riches are his god." WANDESFORD. SNUGLY in one of the coves or inlets lay a large pleasure yacht, which Stanhope smilingly induced Flora to enter in search of her governess.  She was but too willing to gratify his wishes.  Descending the companion-way, she saw in the distance a male and female in close conversation, whom she sup- posed to be Bristow and Miss Bankhead.     It ap- peared strange to the young girl that the latter did not join them.   The attentions of her lover dispelled any  unpleasant thought, nor did    the gentle motion of the vessel awake her to the re- ality of her situation ere it was too late.   Yes! she was beyond the reach of succor; no father's arm could guard her from  danger.   20     MARIAN WALLACE. When Stanhope announced to Flora the desper- ate steps he had taken, swoon succeeded swoon, until they feared the vital spark had fled, ere their troths were plighted at the altar. He was hastening as fast as wind and tide could bear them to the landmark of fugitive lovers, Gretna Green. A Gretna marriage would make them indissolubly one. Few parents he knew cared, for the honor of their family, to disannul this humilia- ting and disgraceful marriage after its solemniza- tion, though the age ;of the parties signing the contract sometimes warrants the procedure. On- ward was this young being borne on the bosom of the blue waters, to meet a fate into which she had been treacherously beguiled. Not all the blandishments of her lover could dispel the heavy forebodings with which she was oppressed. She knew the proud, vindictive nature /f her mother. She knew the high tone of honor Which pervaded every avenue of her father's heart. All this she knew, and she dreaded the act, which, to her friends, must appear- voluntary on her part. Stan- hope was so sanguine of their forgiveness, how could she overshadow the high hopes he entertainl- ed of their immediate restoration to favor on their return. The morn which ushered in her bridal day was   MARIAN  WALLACE.       21 beautifully serene. The time and place added a charm to the surrounding scenery. The glorious orb of day was shedding his rosy light in the eastern sky; the faint tints were reflected on the waters below. Flora saw not, heeded not these beauties of nature, so deeply was she engrossed in the part she was about to perform in the great drama of life. The helmsman guided the little bark-as it sped swiftly across the deep, as though life or death was the issue of the contest. Might it not be? She shuddered at the thought-there may have been an immediate pursuit. Her imagi- nation presented dread phantoms which were not wholly allayed until after their safe arrival. Immediately on their arrival they were united by the magistrate, paid the fine, and received an admonitory lecture from the minister of the vil- lage. Such was the degrading ceremony to which Stanhope subjected the young and beautiful Flora. Where were her father and her friends? In hot pursuit after the fugitives. One and another of their relatives were stationed to intercept them in their flight, ere they reached Gretna, not dream- ing of the daring and hazardous route-that of gaining it in an open boat. Such was the deter- mined spirit of Stanhope, that he would have sac- rificed his own life and that of his companion, U   22     MARIAN WALLACE. ere he would have been thwarted in his under- taking. How sad that such energies had not a high and ennobling aim. Scarcely allowing her time to rest from the fa- tigues of her journey, so elated was he with the triumph achieved, and so anxious was he to dis- play the trophy of his victory near the citadel of the enemy, he hastened the departure of her whom he now called his own, reqommencing their journey homeward, and meeting with no interrup- tion during their first stage, they stopped in per- fect security to change horses. Entering in order to procure refreshments, they stood face to face with the injured father. The guilty being bowed his head before the calm, searching glance of Mr. Leslie; he stammered out an apology. "Silence, miscreant, lest I sully my hands, by inflicting' the chastisement your conduct merits! Let my erring daughter pronounce your doom. Flora, is this wretch your husband?" "Father, forgive! he is my husband." "Enough!" Placing the pistol he drew from his bosom on the table, "Cowardly, dastardly villain., couldst thou not look on Hesperian fruit without daring to obtain it? Couldst thou not have left me my one ewe lamb? Tell me, villain, who were, your   1       ? NxMARIAN WALLACE.      23 i  accomplices; and, mark me, the irst untruth you utter shall mark your doom!" "Flora, let us close this unpleasant interview," said Stanhope, approaching his weeping bride. "Touch her, at your peril, until I, her injured father, give you the right! Let me have your un- welcome presence ini my rooim, as early as eleven o'clock to-morrow, with a correct account of all your debts." Passing his arm around his trembling child, "Fear not, that I shall question hei in relation to the past. Far be it from me to cause a wife to speak dishonorably of her husband, though that husband be a villain in the estimation of her father! Retire with me, my daughter." Stanhope was left writhing with mortification.  "Well, I suppose I must make a virtue of ne- cessity, and give the old gent a pretty correct statement of all demands against my humble self, to gratify his prying curiosity. Well, if he will only satisfy my creditors, what care I, though a clog is attached to the broad lands I hope to pos- sess? She is pretty and passive enough to satisfy the most fastidious. Heigho! I wonder what my Juliet of D-  will think when she hears that her Romeo is bound by the silken cords of Hymen? What a transcendently glorious creature she is, with her eyes of jetty night! Doubtless, I      24      MARIAN  WALLACE. shall experience some difficulty in calming the passionate beauty. One flash of her meteor eye is worth all the dove-like smiles of my quiet beauty, were it not for the necessary appendages attending these smiles. Away with the remem- brances of the past; I must prepare myself to enact the humble son and affectionate husband, bowed down with a proper sense of the enor- mity of the sin I havre committed."' Thus spoke Stanhope. At the hour appointed by Mr. Leslie, he present- ed himself /at his apartments. The persons already assembled rather disconcerted our hero's equanimity. He now, for the first time, understood that Mr. Leslie intended making it a business transaction; giving a haughty and angry glance towards the spot where Mr. Leshe was standing in earnest conversation with his lawyer, who, immediately on seeing he had entered, advanced to meet him, and requested his accounts, as it was -of the utmost importance this unpleasant business should be transacted immediately. Being anxious to hasten his return to relieve the anxiety of- Mrs. Leslie, whom he had left seriously indisposed, each account underwent a careful examination before passing into the lawyers hands, who announced that they amounted to the small sum of ten thousand   ::        MARIAN  WALLACE.       25 pounds sterling. Not one word followed this !  startling intelligence. The injured and the in- jurer sat face to face. Silence reigned in that apartment, broken only by the suppressed groan of Mr. Leslie, who, however, soon sufficiently, re- covered himself to address Stanhope. "Young man, I suffer for the shipwreck of my daughter's happiness, about to be allied to a gam- bler; many, perhaps, may blame me for trusting her happiness to the keeping of such a one; while I have it in my power to wrest her from his insidious grasp. This would I do, were I influenced alon6 by parental love. Far, rather, would I bear her to the tomb of her ancestors, than resign her this day to the arms of a man destitute of every noble quality; Who has already squandered one third of the fortune intended as her bridal portion; but slander, with its barbed arrow, must not enter the bosom of any member of my family, if there is any possibility of avert- ing it. My daughter loves you as much as one of her age is capable of. May she never realize the hallucination under which she labors, when she resi  her freedom to one whom her father abhors.' Stung to the quick by the sarcastic manner of Mr. Leslie, as he uttered the last part of this sen- 2 \        /   26    E MARIAN  WALLACE. tence, Stanhope rose, and bowing, thanked Mr. Leslie for the high estimation he entertained of him; notwithstanding which, he " considered it the proudest moment of his life. Erring he had been; was it not human but a forgiving heart was one of the blessings bestowed upon him by the wise dispenser of our spiritual and temporal benefits; and, when you this day assign your daughter to my keeping, I shall receive her as a gift from that bountiful Benefactor." "Yes. Well, very well, wilt my daughter be protected in a camp, and supported on an en- sign's pay! Farther than paying your debts, and giving 'five hundred pounds to keep you from actual starvation, not one farthing more need you expect from me. Now, as the financiAl business is concluded, you will oblige me by attending to the more solemn and important duties which have brought us together." Mr, Leslie retired, and returned with Flora leaning upon his arm, followed by the ladies of the house. The solemn and imposing ceremony of the Church of England was here performed in the presence of her father, which made the twain one in flesh, though widely disunited in spirit. Immediately after the ceremony, and before they separated, prayer was offered up for the erring   'MARIAN WALLACE.     .   27 I  pair, about to enter upon the voyage of life to- i  pgether, upon whom the doors of the parental man- y sion must necessarily be closed. Mr. Leslie then i  informed them, that Mrs. Mortimer, Flora's grand- mother, would receive them  at her house, and that they might consider themselves. at home : tlere, until Stanhope received orders to join his regiment, when Mrs. Stanhope would be expected to accompany him. W e will not follow the travellers in their jour- neyings, but return to Mrs. Leslie, who was suf- fering from the apparent ingratitude of the idol of her fondest hopes. Pride and parental affec- tion waged bitter war against each other. Pride and passion held the preponderancy. With bitter '  and vindictive feelings would she have erased the ; image of her lovely child from her bosom, and pronounced her anathema against her forever, had not Mrs. Mortimer convinced her of the impro- priety of such an act. "See her! mother, I can- not own her as my child---urge it not. Could I annihilate her very existence, methinks I could nerve my soul to its accomplishpment." Amy, I regret exceedingly, that a daughter of m mine should entertain such sentiments as you h ave just expressed. Think you, of the beneficent Author of our existence,-how   long-suffering;   28      MARIAN  WALLACE. think how willing He is to pardon and forgive our many transgressions; how  kindly His almighty arm is outstretched to receive the returning prodigal; and shall we, poor, frail, human 'be- ings, not forgive our fellow-creatures when they, err against us? You cannot consistently receive Flora at present, nor until she fully acknowl- edges her fault.' An acknowledgment on the part of the erring pair I certainly think most necessary; and a sufficient amount of dignity on the part of the parent, I certainly think justifia- ble-but further than that we, as parents, ought not to go. My dear daughter, do not misunder- stand me-that I want to justify them  in the course they have pursued; far from it. But as it has taken place, let us make the' best of it that the circumstances will allow; let us show our dis- approbation in an humble and Christian manner, and not cast them away as utterly unworthy to associate with us. Let me hear that you approve of my proceedings, when I tell you, that I in- tend to purchase for Stanhope a lieutenancy, to enable him, in a measure, to take the first step toward raising Flora to that pinnacle from which he has hurled her, by his precipitate conduct; and that my home shall be theirs, till they can find a more congenial one. What! my daughter,     ,      .   MARIAN  WALLACE.      29 no answer to the suggestion of an aged mother? I do not wish to press my daughter to give an unwilling assent to what I consider my duty. Reflect! had you, my only daughter, committed such a very great impropriety against your pa- rents, could you have borne to be cast away Tfrom their home and their hearts, upon a selfish world? Then, why do that to your daughter which would have been insupportable in your case?,' Mrs. Leslie gave a reluctant consent to what it was not in her power to control, with the un- derstanding that her mother must not expect her to visit her house while they remained her guests. Satisfied with even her daughter's unwilling con- sent, Mrs. Mortimer returned to her own dwell- ing to await the arrival of the solitary pair, whom  among all their friends, she alone was to congratulate upon the, most important event of their lives. Every thing was in readiness for them some days before they arrived. They lin- gered in the Highlands to enjoy the wild grandeur of the scenery, both being enthusiastic admirers of the beauties of nature. Fain would they have re- mained in retirement--each having a vague appre- hension how they might be received in society- but for the earnest solicitations of Mrs. Mortimer,   30     MARIAN  WALLACE. who was extremely anxious to have Flora with  herself. Receiving such an affectionate and ear- nest entreaty to return, they retraced their way homeward; but, arriving at midnight, Stanhope proposed ordering rooms at the hotel, and in the morning announcing to Mrs. Mortimer their ar- rival. While discussing this point, the old and valued friend of the family, Miss Woolsey, re- ceived the weeping Flora, in her arms. She had been waiting for several hours in a carriage, to convey them to the residence of Mrs. Mortimer, who had begged her to apologize to her dear Flora and her husband, that her age prevented her from coming such a distance, and remaining so long in the carriage, as it was so uncertain when the vessel would arrive; and to assure them she would not retire for the night, until she had welcomed them in person to her home. Thus reassured, they ar- rived in safety at Eden Grove, and were warmly and kindly received by their venerable grand- parent. A warm and plentiful supper awaited the travellers. Flora pleaded fatigue, and begged to be excused from partaking of the repast. Miss Woolsey waited upon her to her room, and acted the part of attendant to the tired and trembling bride. Kissing her pale cheek, she left her to the repose she so much needed. Flora found that i   Ito -      MARIAN  WALLACE.       31 every necessary comfort had been provided by her affectionate grandmother; even Stanhope was loud in praise of the handsome manner in which she had received them. Days and weeks' came in suc- cession, and yet no allusion was made to the past, nor to the cause which had domiciled Flora in this, now her only home, with Mrs. Mortimer. She felt assured by Flora's manner, that her mind was ill at ease, and she longed to sympa- thize with the- d  child; but the right to do so must be given by Flora, who she doubted not would yield to the soothing influence of time, and give her her entire confidence. She felt pleased more than she was willing to acknowledge, by Stan- hope's affectionate manner, and the pleasure it apparently gave him, as the buzz of admiration met his ear, whenever he appeared, accompanied by his bride. Mrs. Mortimer could not but ac- knowledge it as a very justifiable compliment, as Flora and Stanhope were certainly very handsome. Mrs. Mortimer felt the loss of her daughter's and Mr. Leslie's society deeply, as even cards had not been exchanged since the arrival of her guests, and the time was fast approaching when Flora would need a mother's kind and sympathetic voice to soothe her in lher hour of peril. But the crisis passed, and with it came not, that mother, to   32      MARIAN WALLACE. hear the earnest entreaty of that frail being on the confines of the grave, plead to be restored tojthe favor of her adored mother, ere she went he ce to be no more. Long was heri life despair- ed of. Every thing that medical skill could devise, and affectionate love could bestow, was brought to alleviate the sufferings of the lovely patient; and when pronounced 'out of danger, gratefully and thankfully did Mrs. Mortimel receive from the arms of Stanhope, the first pledge of his wedded bliss, and recognized in it her great-grandson; and as she pressed his velvet cheeks to her lips, she of- fered up a fervent prayer, that it might be a pledge of reconciliation between its mother and her pa- rents. During her dangerous illness and protract- ed recovery, Mr. Leslie called regularly every day at Eden Grove, to inquire after Flora. As her convalescence progressed, his inquiries became less frequent, which it became necessary to keep the invalid in ignorance of, and she was assured, as soon as she was able to receive company, her dear father would be the first to forgive and con- gratulate her; and, forgiven by her parents, how happy she would be in administering to the wants of the tiny little being committed to her care. But' time passed, and effected no reconciliation. There was a pensive melancholy stealing over the   MARIAN  WALLACE.      33  I'w       .               s. lovely features of Flora, which grieved her grand- mother, who was unable to heal the wound made by the continued coldness of her parents. Even the cooing of her nestling dove, could not, at all times, chase the saddening expression from the fond mother's gaze, as she bent over the cradle-roof of her darling babe, to kiss his brow of love. How would her breast heave with the thought, that any act he might commit would become so heinous in her sight, as to cause perpetual banishment; and as her mind reverted to that passage of Holy Writ, wherein is written: "That she may forget Na- ture-may fail a parent's heart to move." Then did she exclaim in the depth of her heart, "This is my case; nothing can move my parents to forgive me!" She knew, ere long, she must leave the land of her birth, for an indefinite space of time. Stanhope having received orders to join the regi- ment when he had received a lieutenancy, by pur- chase, it became his imperative duty to proceed thither without delay. How many conflicting feel- ings agitated the bosom of his wife, Is the time approached when she must bid farewell to her na- tive land. Though, from the time of her marriage, she had looked forward to the probability of such an event, yet, when it really was about to take place, her affectionate heart was deeply pained. 2'   34      MARIAN  WALLACE. As a wife and mother, she knew it to be her duty to share hardships with him who must now be all on earth to her. Marriage had not been to her the Eden of bliss her young and affectionate heart. had imagined, not that she had any reason to complain of iUn kindness on the part of Stanhope; he was scru- pulously exact in paying her all the little attentions so gratifying to a sensitive mind, still the void re- mained in her affectionate heart. Mrs. Mortimer regretted the necessity of part- ing with Flora; yet, to separate her from her hus- band would subject her to animadversions, which his conduct, since he had been her guest, would justify. However reluctant she might be, she felt it to be the imperative duty of her grand- daughter to join her husband at Woolwich as soon as matters could be arranged for her comfort, as passenger, in the transport ship which was to leavo in the early part of the following week.   ARIAN   WALLACE.        35 She left me for her home above; Her dying lips were closed in prayer That' strangers for her babe might care. Ere closed the grave o'er her mortal clay, Strangers had borne me far away. ALL was bustle and confusion at Eden Grove; the only notice taken of her departure by the in- mates of Shirly Park was that they sent Flora's nurse with her trousseau, which had never been forwarded; and, as that warm-hearted and affec- tionate creature folded the delicate form   of her foster-child to her heart, she exclaimed: "Och cusha, it isn't thim that would be afther keepin' owld Nannie whin her wee bit waxen doll was agoin' over the big wather.   Didn't I tould thm who would be afther takin' care of yese whin that big gintleman was away fightin' the furiners. Och! it was on my binded knee I begged thim o) let owld Nannie go.  Didn't I plade with the mother of yese, avourneen; and its here I am,   36     MARIAN WALLACE. and Nannie will never lave you till that big sol- dier, or gineral, or whatsomever yese call him, brings ye back to owld Ireland. Isn't it I that ken take the bist of care of the wee bit bantling, like I used to did of yoursel', honey." Flora's grateful heart acknowledged the sacrifice her faithful nurse was making, when she volun- teered to leave her home and family to accom- pany her to a distant land, the person engaged to accompany her being young, and inexperienced in the care of children.           / Every thing being now arranged to the entire satisfaction of Mrs. Mortimer, Flora bade adieu to her affectionate grandmother, with many charges for her to be careful bf her precious health, and if the climate proved unhealthy, to return imme- diately. The travellers arrived in safety at Wool- wich, where they were joined by Stanhope, who was very much annoyed by Flora's travelling com- panion; he knew her to be a garrulous old woman, devotedly attached to the Leslies, and she would, noi doubt, communicate all the transactions that transpired, in her own impartial way-for he had not the most remote idea of playing the agreeable in the garrison. As our readers will not be interested in the occur- rences of a transport ship with its number of troops,   J.      MARIAN WALLACE.        37 we will leave our travellers to plough the mighty- ocean, with its foaming path and phosphorous light, and return to the inhabitants of Shirly Park. Mrs. Leslie remained a constellation in the gay ranks :  of fashion; none who saw the dignity of her bear- ing, or the suavity of her manners; could have sup- posed that aught remained in her bosom but the 7 t  gentle qualities of the female character. That proud, determined expression had departed; it was re- placed by a distressful anxiety, seen only in repose, by a critical observer. Anxious-she could not be otherwise; disappointed in her hopes and expecta- tions in relation to the worldly aggrandizement of her daughter. Was that daughter happy.? Her maternal heart was more anxious than she was will- ing to allow; though seemingly opposed to Nannie's accompanying her, she was secretly pleased with the proposition, and furthered it by her apparent opposition. No one, till now, had dared to breathe her daughter's name in her presence since the fatal morning she absconded. She had sufficient proof of the culpability of Miss Bankhead's conduct, yet, until accused by the injured party, she would not stoop to become her accuser. She had not given tlhi slightest intimation to Mr. Leslie that her sus- picions were aroused in relation to the part that had been enacted by Miss Bankhead.  She had   38     MARIAN WALLACE. treated her with even more cordiality, which was calculated to lull the suspicions of that lady en- tirely; there was a malicious triumph in the glancd of Mrs.. Leslie's eye whenever she gazed upon her. With her mother she was truly annoyed; she had taught her a lesson of patient forbearance when grievously injured. It was a yoke her unsubdued heart felt unwilling to bear. She could not meet her as a daughter should, though, in her better moments, she envied the feelings which enabled her to act in such an humble and Christian man- ner. Though not a professing Christian, every ac- tion of her life gave evidence of the purity of her mind and the noble qualities of her heart. She had lived half a century in the fashionable Euro- pean world, but it had not blunted the good and noble qualities she had brought from her Indian home. It is now about eighteen months since Flora's departure. Eden Grove is thrown open to a large and fashionable assemblage, to celebrate the sev- entieth birthday of its noble proprietress. Among the guests assembled was one whom we shall call Miss Harvey. A stranger and an humble follower of the Lord, she found little to gratify her taste in the fashionable amusements by which she was sur- rounded; left veryemuch to her own resources, she   i 1MARIAN       WALLACE.       39 sought amid the beauties of nature for companion- ship more congenial to her exalted mind; and i amply was she repaid, when she could exclaim from the depths of her heart, "My heavenly Father made them all!"  Having wandered farther than she anticipated, and feeling very much fatigued, she requested permission to enter a neat but lowly dwelling, whose only occupant was a female be- longing to the humbler walks of life. She was preparing what appeared to be nourishment for an invalid. Her attention was instantly attracted by the entrance, from an inner room, of a lovely child, who appeared to have seen scarcely two summers. She gazed upon the gentle apparition and then upon the female, but could trace no resemblance in the lineaments of her face; then came the in- quiry, "Are you the mother of that lovely babe?" Never could. she forget the mournful expression of that face, as the cottager answered, "'Would- that I were, poor thing; it will soon be without one, as it is without a father, who was called away, in the providence of God, but one short week ago." Having heard the circumstances, she re- quested permission to see the invalid, if it would not be considered an intrusion on the privacy of grief The request was politely complied with. She entered the sfck chamber, and beheld one   40      MARIAN WALLACE. of the most beautiful countenances with the signet of death on its calm and lovely brow. The in- valid might be about twenty-two years old. There was time to contemplate her lovely face, as she was dozing when her visitor entered; but she soon awoke. Never had Miss Harvey seen such patient resignation to the will of God, or such unshaken confidence in the promises of the Lord. The in- terview was one of deep interest; to her. The little the invalid was able to say of herself, was clear and satisfactory; but the waves of Jordan were rushing fast around that frail and lovely bark. When they thought her spirit had taken its .ever- lasting flight, she revived, anl asked to see her child again. Nature seemed to linger around its citadel, as if loth to break the strong ties of affec- tion; and when she gazed upon. the child all the love of a mother beamed from her eyes. Placing her hands, cold with the dews of death, upon the head of the dear loved one, she committed her to the care of the covenant-keeping God. She prayed her heavenly Father to open the heart of some good, benevolent person to take her child. When reminded that she was leaving another, but one week old, she answered with B solemn voice," My fathe: has provided for him." Her work was then, as it were, completed, for she calmly sleptin Jesus.   MARIAN  WALLACE.       41 After contemplating such a scene, Miss Harvey felt very little disposed to return to the halls of gayety she had just quitted; but fearing her pro- longed absence might give her kind hostess un- necessary alarm, she retraced her steps' to Eden Grove, and arrived in time to dress for dinner. After the cloth was removed and the ladies had retired to 'the drawing-room, Miss Harvey was rallied on her want of spirits. She then related ;  the circumstance of the departure of the dying" Christian that she had witnessed in the morning, and all the circumstances as far as she had been made acquainted with them; describing the beauty and interesting appearance of the child left without father, mother, or earthly friend. "Why not be a friend to that little orphan, yourself, Miss Harvey?" responded Mr. Gamble, a phlegmatic, epicure, who catered to the tastes of the company in filsome flattery, that he might satisfy his epicurean tastes at their bountiful tables. "Why not play the lady-bountiful to the- little darling, and become responsible for all the sweet creature may require?" Miss Harvey turned her searching gaze on the face of the speaker as she uttered these words: "Simply because I am deprived of the means, not from any extravagance on' my part, but from the   42     . MARIAN  WALLACE. culpability of others." Bowing coldly to Mr. Gam- ble, she retired to a distant part of the room. Mrs. Mortimer was grieved- that the sensitive feelings of Miss Harvey should have been wounded, and that, too, by one who had deeply injured her in times past. Excusing herself as; soon as pos- sible, she stepped to where Miss Harvey was seated, and endeavored to excuse Gamble's remarks as un- intentional in their personality. "My dear friend, I was very much interested in your Velation of the circumstances connected with the death of the mother of those children; but as I could rot give my undivided attention at the time, you will oblige me by again relating the particulars as far as you have ascertained them. Am I to understand that the little creatures have no earthly friends to whom they can go?" -"None, my dear madam, as far as I know. Their being strangers, and living so much secluded,-pre- vented any approach to familiarity on the part of their neighbors, so that their history is involved in obscurity, except what little may be learned from the nurse who was in attendance. Never have I had my sympathies more enlisted then for those little children, cast upon a cold and selfish world, without natural protection. From the appearance of the mother, she must have belonged to the bet- !,         -   eI3 MARIAN       WALLACE.       43 ter class; there was a degree of refinement in the general appearance of the abode. What little she was able to say, gave evidence that her education had not been neglected." When Mrs. Mortimer had retired to the quiet of her own room, she longed to know in what way she might dispose of some of the benefits that a bountiftil Providence had bestowed upon her, sat- isfactorily to herself. The little girl might be pro- vided with a home at her expense, were it not for the infant. How could she, at her advanced age, assume such a responsibility? and to separate them she felt would be the height of cruelty. Long did this train of thought disturb her slumbers, and it was late next morning when Mrs. Mortimer made her appearance in her breakfast parlor. Her friends had dispersed in different directions in the garden, leaving Miss Harvey and Miss Woolsey in earnest conversation on a subject of very little interest to them-the interment of the deceased. Miss Woolsey had kindly volunteered to assist Miss Harvey in the arduous undertaking. Mrs. Mortimer silenced all the arguments they made use of, by taking the responsibility on her- self. Ringing to order her carriage, the bell was answered by her maid, who entered with a beauti- fill child in her arms.   "     MARIAN WALLACE. "Campbell! where did you .find that child '?" ex- claimed Miss Harvey. "My dear Mrs. MDortimer, this is the very child I have been telling you about. Is it not the sweetest creature you ever beheld?" \ But the little stranger so unceremoniously intro- duced, had no idea of having her charms criticized; she distorted her face, and uttered sounds loud and shrill, giving convincing proof of the healthy con- dition of her lungs. It was necessary to remove her immediately. "It seems a remarkable coincidence that that child should be brought so unexpectedly into my presence. I cannot but think that it was an inte- position of Providence, intended to intimate thal it is my duty to take her and bring her up, thaI she may become a useful member of society. If you, my tried and valued friend, Miss Woolsey, will lend a helping hand in the care of her, I will, from this day, consider her mine. Campbell, I know, will assist us, for she has a good and honest heart; and with two such helpmates, I have no doubt the work will prosper. For the infant I intend procuring a wet nurse; Fanny shall take charge of that department; so then I, shall have you all employed. Don't you think I should make a good general, by enlisting you all into my service?" Miss Harvey was utterly unable to express her   I MxARIAN      WALLACE.       45 '4! !  feelings; she wept and laughed alternately. When sufficiently recovered, the language of her heart was: "O Lord, thou art a prayer-hearing God; i  Thou hast instructed Thy children to call upon ri d Thlee in the day of trouble, and Thou wilt hear !  and answer their petitions; Thou hast heard the prayer of thy dying servant in behalf of her father- less children, and answered it in an almost mirac- ulous manner.   O 'Father, do thou continue to shower down thy blessings on their infant heads. I  Be with them through the journey of life, and when the struggle of life is ended, may they re- join their parents in thy glorious kingdom, where parting is unknown." The carriage had been standing some time ere the party were sufficiently composed to enter, that they might proceed to make the necessary arrange- ments for the funeral, which was to take place on the following day. They drove immediately to the undertaker's.' They described the manner in which they desired the services to be conducted, and directed the remains to be taken to the church. -As many from the house as could be spared were to follow the remains to. their last resting-place. It was thought best not to remove the children until after the funeral. Every respect was paid to the memory of the parent of the children who so   "     MARIAN  WALLACE. soon were to become inhabitants of Eden Grove. When the time arrived that it became necessary to remove them, *the little girl clung with such tenacity to the. nurse, that it was impossible to separate them. She was too young to realize the loss she had sustained-and that her mother's spirit had been released ere her mission of love to her nestling had been accomplished-but old enough to know that her kiss of love was unre- turned. It was deeply touching to hear her infant voice exclaim, "Mamma won't kiss her baby! baby not naughty now!"The eyes of all were suffused with tears, as they gazed on the tiny thing clad in the habiliments of mourning, endeavoring with infantine endearments to arouse the inanimate form of her parent. There was a sombre shade cast over the inhab- itants of Eden Grove by their participation in the funeral obsequies of the unknown lady, which could not be entirely thrown off. The arrival of the little strangers was not calculated to remi(N ffhe impression. They were soon fairly established withl their respective nurses at the Grove, but it seemed impossible to reconcile the little girl to so many strange faces. As a last resort, they engaged to accompany her the person who had had the care of her mother, and to whom she had been much   MARIAN  WALLACE.       47 *s  attached, until the child became familiar with the family. Nor was it long before she would play hide-and-s6ek behind the nurse's apron, and shake her jetty curls in childish coquetry if they pre- sumned to pass without noticing her. She soon gained the hearts of the entire household with her winning ways, and every day gave convincing proof of the danger there would have been of her becoming what is called a spoiled child, had not Miss Woolsey cautioned the family against it. With v-isitors, it was otherwise; the incessant praise of her charms was a theme that met her childish ears; and it was astonishing how becomingly the compliments were accepted by the little lady her- self. The death of her' baby brother was a great source of grief; she wept over the little coffin, and when told' that God had taken him up to hea- ven, to live with her father and. mother, and that if she was a good child, when she died she should go up to that bright world to live with him for- ever, the language of her infant lips was, "I wish I could die and go up to my pretty mamma." It would have pleased Mrs. Mortimer better if her childish memory had not been refreshed. She loved her sincerely, and longed to have her think she belonged to herself; but with such a memory as the little Marian possessed, she feared that i                    '  A   48     MARIAN WALLACE. would be utterly impossible. It was astonishing how much knowledge she retained of her "other home," as she termed it, and would many times in the day ask, when she should go to her " other home."  Often the thought would arise in Miss Woolsey's mind whether she could be happy, hav- ing such a distinct recollection of her infant home; yet the apparent joyousness of her childish manner dissipated such unpleasant thoughts. Her early childhood being shrouded in gloom, it devolved upon Miss Woolsey to train her infant mind preparatory to entering school. Soft and pliable was she-like wax in an artist's mould, ready to receive whatever impress his artistic knowledge may devise. "O that the image of our adorable Lord may be the first impress on her mind," was the fervent supplication of her Christian friend. When twilight's deepening shades gather- ed around the visible works of creation, she would take the little prattler on her knee, and teach her:' infant voice to carol the name of the great Cre- ator, who formed and upholds all things by his al- mighty power. When Miss Woolsey was engaged with company, as it sometimes happened, at the accustomed hour, Marian would take her seat by herself, and repeat such hymns as she loved best. If asked what she was doing in the dark, she would   MARIAN WALLACE.        49 answer, "Marian is talking with God." If asked if she loved God, she would reply, "No, I don't love him, for I don't know him; but I love Miss Woolsey, and she talks with him, apd I want to do what she does." Her powers of imitation were great; what she saw once done would be accomplished by her in her childish way. There was company staying at Eden Grove, and among them, a gentleman who had shown great partiality for her, and it was her cus- tom, as soon as dressed, to go to his room door, and plead to enter. She had been in the habit of seeing him shave. Descending to the breakfast- parlor one morning in a hurry, he left the razors on the dressing-table. Miss Marian embraced the opportunity of trying her skill in the art of shaving on herself; but the house-maid coming in, dis- turbed her in her operations, and caused her to inflict a summary lesson on her face, never for- gotten. She early manifested a decided taste for, theatri- cal performances. When about four years old she was taken to see Othello performed. An indelible impression was made on her memory by this play, so that on the day following, and for weeks after, she was able to go through, in pantomime, nearly all the acts, much to the amusement of Mrs. Mor- 3   O0      MARIAN  WALLACE. timner and her comtany. Miss Woolsey expostu- lated with Mrs. Mortimer, on the impropriety of permitting her to witness such exhibitions. "My dear Miss Woolsey, how can you be so strictly puritanical in your principles, as to wish to preclude a clild from a thing which it seems utterly impossible she should understand?" "Were she a child of ordinary capacity, I should not hesitate to say it would be uninjurious;- but are you not cultivating a taste for luxury and re- finement, that is calculated to make the possessor unhappy?  Carry out your philanthropic views, formed as they were over the grave of her de- ceased parent, to make her a useful member of society. Let the pleasures and fashionable amuse- ments of the world be as a sealed book to her young heart. Should she live, and you be spared to her, she will see enough of the fashionable world to interest and amuse her. Excuse my man- ner of speaking; they are plain truths, Mrs. Mor- timer; they come from  a heart that beats with true friendship for you and the helpless orphan, whose care has been voluntarily assumed by you. Give her a sound education; implant the- fear of God in her young heart, and should the waves of adversity ever press hard, amid the ocean of life, {   j       RMARIAN WALLACE.       51 she will have a sure helm to guide her to the haven of bliss." "You know, my dear Miss Woolsey,", Mrs. Mor- timer replied, "I should never have assumed such a responsibility, without intending to make pro- vision for Marian, maintaining that position to which I have exalted her. I know it would be mistaken kindness to create feelings and elevate hopes which must be forever crushed when I am laid in the silent grave. I have made it a mat- ter of serious consideration, and have consulted my friend and legal adviser, Mr. Carleton; from him I have received the very best counsel on the sub- ject," - "Nothing," said Miss Woolsey, "but the love I bear the child, who has entwined herself around the strongholds of my affections, could have induced me to speak thus freely to you, Mrs. Mortimer; but were yeu to die without making such provision for her, she would necessarily be thrown on the generosity of your heirs, and with such a high spirit as she gives evidence of possessing, it would be unhappiness in the extreme." "I wish you could know," Mrs. Mortimer ex- claimed, "what a weight of anxiety has been re- moved from my mind, by your judicious consider-   52      MARIAN   WALLACE. ation of the future wants of the dear child. Hence- forth she will not be considered by me the pet and plaything of aristocracy, to be thrown aside on. the first fitting opportunity."  .

I ' SEATED in the boudoir by the side of her hus- band, Mrs. Leslie's countenance gave evidence of sion. "Leslie did you ever see any thing so absurd, as motler permitting the entrance of tat fairy of a child, whom nobody knows any thing about, with the dessert, and taking her place with the naivete" of one born to occupy a position among us? My indignation was so great, that it required' the utmost self-control to prevent my retiring instantly. I would not have accepted the invitation, had it   54      MARIAN WALLACE., not been to meet my friend, the Duchess of D--, whom I have not seen for many years,-since that unpleasant lifficulty, originating in a mistake on her part. She might have attributed my absence to a recollection of the occurrence, and the pain it would cause me to meet her again. I certainly shall express my sentiments in very plain terms when I make my morning call.   I understand mother has consulted Carleton; but he is as true a friend to the heirs as he is to the present pro- prietress. Had she any other than him for her legal adviser, I should insist on your taking the management of the estate." "Which honor, my dear wife, I should beg leave to decline." "How can you talk so, Mr. Leslie? Are you not convinced, as well as myself, that it is a proof of imbecility of mind,-a total unfitness to control her property; to take a child, at her advanced age, to play lady patroness to? If her caprices are so strong, as to make it necessary that theshounld be indulged, why does she not take that imp of Stanhope's? Stanhope, I am sure, would be thank- ful to be released from the charge. It would af- ford me unspeakable satisfaction." "Amy, I cannot acquiesce in your unkind re- marks in relation to our beloved' mother. She   ! .  . MARIAN WALLACE.     .   65 ought, certainly, to feel at liberty to use her proper- ty in any way that will best promote her happi- ness. The care of that little creature cannot se- riously interfere to injure us in our worldly pros- pects; were she to dispose entirely of your share of the property, she should have my hearty ap- proval." ft   "Mr. Leslie, how absurd your reasonings appear to me; I feel almost disposed to be angry with }i  you. Allow me, however,\ to guard you against making any such assertion in my mother's pres- ence; she relies implicitly on your superior judg- ment; and were you to sanction the absurd un- dertaking, I have no doubt, you would be reward- ed for your acquiescence with the loss of the in- heritance of myself and children." "Amy, have I ever shown a mercenary spirit in my dealings with my fellow-man?  Have I proved myself a cold and calculating husband to the wife of my bosom? Are my children afraid to make known to me their wants? Have I not enough of this world's goods to support my family in princely elegance? Then why should I envy my fellow-being the necessaries of life? Never will my voice be raised to check the ijromptings of a generous heart." "Really, Leslie, you are provokingly pointed in   56      MARIAN  WALLACE. your remarks this morning, for which I must re- turn you my unfeigned thanks." ".No thanks due, my dear wife; had I been aware what was to be the subject of discussion, I should have pleaded a prior engagement. I knew by the expression -of your countenance for some days past that your mind was ill at ease, and I flattered myself you intended negotiating a truce with the Stanhope faction. TBy the way, I under- stand he has been promoted to the rank of cap- tain, by the retirement of our friend Bristow in con- sequence of ill health. O, how I do long to fold that dear child to my bosom, and soothe her with my affectionate caresses! Let the viol of your wrath cease to pour forth its indignation on the object of my warmest love, lest I inflict a sum- mary punishment, by recalling the wanderer from her father's heart to the lost place in the home of her childhood." "My dear husband, you have anticipated my wishes; nothing is farther from my heart than the perpetual banishment of my child. I will, with your permission, write by this day's mail a warm and affectionate invitation for Flora and her hus- band to join us in our Christmas festivities." Mr. Leslie kissed the smooth brow of his smil- ing wife. She had ever been to him as an April   I X .

There she encountered Mrs.  Leslie, who had been paying. a visit, descending in no very agreeable mood to her carriage. Ma- rian shrank back as she encountered her scrutiniz-  ing gaze. Children early have a realizing sense of who are their friends, although an unkind word may never have been uttered. Such was the case with Mrs. Leslie and Marian; there was a mutual enmity springing up in their bosoms, without any apparent cause. Marian had not regained a cheer-  ful countenance when she appeared in Mrs. Mor- timer's presence. "What is the matter with my little pet 2" was the affectionate inquiry of Mrs. Mortimer. "I heard you laugh merrily a few moments ago. Ilave you hurt yourself?"  "No, ma'am, I only saw Mrs. Leslie." "How strange it is, Miss Woolsey, that the child shows such a repugnance to Mrs. Leslie." "I think, my dear madam, it is very easily ac- counted for. Marian has ever been treated kindly   MARIAN  WALLACE.      59 and affectionately by those with whom she is sur- rounded. Mrs. Leslie's manners are not calculated to win the affections of a child whose warmth of love manifests itself in affectionate endearments. Marian will never love where she fears; yet if Mrs. Leslie would unbend, I have no doubt Ma- rian would become attached to her." "It has astonished and grieved me many times, Miss Woolsey, to see how she will run and get behind my chair, or sit at my feet, when she is announced, and remain there during the visit. If I thought any would treat her unkindly, I should certainly request her to discontinue her visits." Marian had early been taught to pray for her benefactress morning and evening; but, from the time it became necessary to send her to school, she was not satisfied with twice a day, but had gone voluntarily to her room, with her bonnet on, and, bending down by her side, would pray for God to take care of hey while she was at school; and immediately on returning, hurry along to the drawing-room, and kneel down by her chair, and thank God for taking care of her while she was away, perfectly indifferent as to who might be present. It was a question whether she was ever aware of the presence of a third person, so ab- sorbed was she in her devotional exercises. Turn-   60      MAIUAN  WALLACE. ing from one of these exercises, she beheld a little boy seated in her chair. Her cheek crimsoned, her eye flashed, her nostrils were distended with  passion; she darted to dispossess him; when Mrs. Mortimer's voice arrested her.  "Marian, I am sorry to see my little girl show such a naughty temper when my little graindson has come such a long way to see his grandma. Don't you think he must be tired, coming such a long way in a large ship, where there was no nice little chair to sit in? Don't you remember my telling you his home was on a rock, where the sea beat. round? and then to think you would not allow him to sit in your chair! What would you think if I were to take it away from you?" She was subdued, and hid her face in lMrs. Mor- timer's lap. She went and put her arms arolmd little Frank, in child-like familiarity, little aware he was expected to supplant her in Mrs. Morti- mer's affections. Ever afterwards, when lie came, she resigned it without a murmur.  Frank and Marian became firm friends. He spent the greater part of his time at his great-grand;parents, and her expansive heart found love sufficient for both. Mrs. Leshe was not an uninterested spectator of Mrs. Mortimer's partiality for little Marian. Yet she saw it would be impolitic in her to manifest S-,           MAI AN WALLACE.      t1 any knowledge of it, and she left to time what it was impossible for her to accomplish. She could not find any fault with her mother's affectionate manner to little Frank; she treated him as a kind, considerate parent would a well-beloved child; yet he was not the avenue through which her mother's heart could be reached; and many were the fam- ilies who sought to conciliate the wealthy Mrs. Mortimer by showing partiality for her protegee. Not a few inivitations were extended to the parents of those whom Marian sought among her school- mates as companions. To utter any complaints to Mr. Leslie, feeling as she knew he did, would be useless. What her mother could see in the fairy of a child she could not define. For her part, she was convinced that Misses Woolsey and Campb Il taught her daily all those tender endearments whic she lavished so fieely upon Mrs. Mortimer, and which it was so provoking for her to witness. She could not but acknowledge she was rather an in- telligent child; but how could she be otherwise with two such tutoresses as Misses Woolsey -and Campbell. How many years, she thought, had they managed to keep her dear mother in leading- strings, with their sanctimonious faces, and senti- ments so inflated with the honorable, that it was impossible to suggest any thing that would be ap-   62     MARIAN  WALLACE.  proved by their code of justice and philanthropic laws. "If it were possible,' said Mrs. Leslie to herself, "I would move heaven and earth, to lessen the hold that child has on my mother's affections. Flora's visit is about drawing to a close; I shall keep Frank with me, and follow the old adage, that 'a continual dropping weareth away a stone.' I regret exceedingly the necessity that any in whose veins flows the blood of the Mortimers or Leslies, should have to select for a companion an offspring of the plebeian herd, even though she may be raised to sit among us." So spoke the haughty Mrs. Leslie, in whom every nobler feeling was corroded by the gangrene of jealousy. Flora parted with her darling boy with many regrets, notwithstanding the advantages that would necessarily accrue to him from a residence with her parents; but she would gladly have waived all such benefits, for the society of her noble boy, had not her mother been so urgent to have him remain. She had no alternative, without displeas- ing the parents tol whom she had become so re- cently reconciled. Another source of uneasiness was the doubt whether Stanhope would be satisfied with the responsibility she had assumed in per- mitting, as a peace-offering, the detention of his boy.   MARIAN WALLACE.       63 The wily Mrs. Leslie exerted her influence with her husband so far as to induce him to purchase a lieutenant-colonel's commission for Stanhope, alleg- ing that, as they were now, in a measure, recon- ciled to the marriage, he ought henceforth to move in a rank befitting the family with which he had become connected. We find Stanhope, by the influence of money, exalted to the highest rank that it can purchase in the army; henceforth his valiant deeds must be the stepping-stone by which he must ascend. After receiviug the commission through the influence of Mr. Leslie, he wrote, announcing the safe arrival of Flora with her infant daughter and nurse; at the same time expressing his thanks for the unex- pected emolument, and for the interest Mr. Leslie had taken in his boy; begging him also not to im- plant other feelings in his youthful mind, than the love of martial glory, as it was his intention to fit him for the army; and wishing Mr. Leslie to en- gage a suitable person to continue the instructions commenced in the fort; adding, "Whatever may be neglected in his education, I shall look to you that the discipline and exercises of a soldier be taught him. I intend him to serve as a private, that when he becomes an officer he may know how to treat those who may be placed under him."   "     MARIAN WALLACE.        i Mr. Leshe was a parent, and he honored the feelings and sentiments of a parent in relation to his child-however widely their views might differ -too much, to interfere with the mode of education laid down by Stanhope. As soon as practicable, he engaged a person recommended by Major Gra- ham, of the --  regiment, then quartered in the' town of B-- , to come to Shirly Park, to instruct the young soldietl to wield the miniature sword; to advance, march, and halt at the word of com- mand. So seldom, however, was young Frank to be found at Shirly Park, that Mr. Leslie suggested the idea, that Monsieur du Prey, the military pre- ceptor, should transfer his visits to Eden Grove, as the young gentleman seemed to have taken up his quarters there. Monsieur had engaged to instruct but one pupil, but at Eden Grove he found two. Marian was as able to wield the sword, and shoul- der the musket as Frank. Monsieur du Prey was charmed with the minute precision with which "petite mademoiselle' went through the drill; he would frequently -exclaim, ' East bon! est bon " But the eulogies which Monsieur du Prey bestowed upon Marian, seemed to her like so many reflec- tions cast on her own Frank, and she would run and put her arms around him, and exclaim, "Never mind, dear, dear Frank, you may stay at home   MARIAN WALLACE.        65 and take care of my goat, and I will go and live on that great rock where your home is. I )will fight in your place, and when I have made all the naughty folks good, I will come back and stay with you and dear Mrs. Mortimer. Don't you love her very much? and Miss Woolsey too? Oh, they are so good! Don't you remember the beautiful story Miss Woolsey told us about the two lambs?-how the Good Shepherd carried them in his arIns.?- and you know the Good Shepherd is Christ; and the little children are the lambs; and he puts his loving arms around them in this world, and shel- ters them from' all harm; and when they die, he takes them up to that beautiful world where they shall strike golden harps, and make sweet music,- far sweeter than blind Allen makes in the front hall. Oh, Frank, wont it be beautiful.?" "I don't know, Marian, any thing about that beautiful world." "Why Frank, the streets are all gold, and the gates are made of pearl; and the angels are there with their bright wings around the throne, where the Good Shepherd sits. Why Frank, Miss Wool- sey must tell you about your beautiful home there. Just wait till yon bright sun hides himself behind the western sky, and I will take you to the oak room, where we shall find Miss Woolsey seated in   "     MARIAN WALLACE. the bay window, waiting to see the twinkling stars shining. out in all their splendor. Wont you come, that is a dear, good Frank? Don't go with the groom to see the horses fed. Miss Woolsey always tells us something so, interesting; and you must go to Sunday-school with me, aid learn every thing that I learn. Sometimes my teacher tells me on the Sabbath, just what Miss Woolsey has told me through the week, in the dim, shadowy twilight. Now, Frank, haven't I very kind friends, to take so much pains to tell me so many good things?" Though Marian received so much religious in- struction, she gave no evidence to her friends that the seed was sown on good ground; she was im- petuous and self-willed, passionate, whenever any thing came to oppose her will,-which was seldom thwarted. Mrs. Mortimer could not think of the child being annoyed in any way. Well would it have been for her in after life, had her indomita- ble will been subdued; very much better would she have been able to bear the ills of life. ,Let us not anticipate. Marian had now passed the first ten years of her life surrounded with lux- ury, and the idol of the household,-which must very soon be dissolved. Death, the king of ter- rors, is about to enter the hitherto happy home-   MARIAN  WALLACE.       67 stead and take from among them the tried and valued friend, the kind and affectionate mistress. Death is about to hurl his relentless arrow at the heart of the earthly guardian of the young being, and consign her to the cold and pitiless world. Short is the summons which announces the po- tentate to whom earthly monarchs resign their crowns. Mrs. Mortimer entered the drawing-room after breakfast, apparently in her usual health, and took her accustomed seat at the work-table-whereon lay the blessed"volume of life, opened at this passage of the inspired Word: "Now let thy servant de- part in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salva- tion."-She read the passage, and conversed freely with Miss Woolsey on the feelings which must have filled ancient Simeo's heart when he gave utterance to this language. After conversing some time, Miss Woolsey bade her good morning, as she had business in town.  Leaving Marian to amuse her until engaged with calls, she had hardly entered her room, when her attention was attracted by a terrific scream from the child. Entering im- mediately, she discovered Mrs. Mortimer fallen from her chairblood streaming from her mouth. Ringing violently for assistance, she had her car- ried to her room, which she was never more to   68      MARIAN  WALLACE. leave until borne to her last resting-place. The physician feared, on his first arrival, that the vital spark had fled; but animation was partially re- stored when Mrs. Leslie arrived. Many days lay the unconscious sufferer, surround- ed by her family and weeping attendants.  The physicians were assiduous in their efforts to pro- long the life of one so generally beloved; but, alas! their efforts were of no avail; each hour proved to the sorrowing friends the fallacy of their hopes. Would returning reason dawn upon the sufferer's mind ere she bade adieu to the scenes of her prolonged sojourn in this vale of tears? Must the voice be hushed which never spoke but in accents of endearment? Must the eye be closed whose halo of love shone so brightly around our path?  Must the arms by which we have been entwined rest still on the heart whose pulsations must cease without one token of recognition? For- bid it, O Almighty Father of the universe! Let returning reason dawn upon the mother, friend and benefactress of the poor. Let each be comforted by words from her dying lips, calculated to soothe them in the different relations they may have sus- tained to the dying sufferer. Ejaculatory prayer was offered frequently from   MARIAN WALLACE.        69 sorrowing hearts to the hearer of prayer, that He would answer their feeble petitions, if consistent with His divine will. He whose ear is ever open to his weakest follower, answered their request, by arousing the sufferer from the lethargy into which she had fallen. Her first inquiry was for Marian. The weeping child was brought to the dying bed of Mrs. Mortimer. She requested an attendant to lift her up, that she might press her to her heart. The child and sufferer were so much affected that the physician insisted upon her being removed, and administered an anodyne, the soothing effects of which enabled Mrs. Mortimer to converse with her family. To Mr. Leslie she consigned the idolized orphan. She entreated Mrs. Leslie to consider her as a dying legacy, bequeathed by an affectionate mother to a well beloved daughter. Her will, she said, would testify how she had made provision for her temporal wants, and the manner in which she desired her education to be conducted. Miss Woolsey 'had been unable to remain for any length of time by Mrs. Mortimer's dying bed. Her sorrow was so overwhelming, that she had just retired to alleviate her anguished heart by in- dulging in the luxury of tears, when a messenger entered to inform her that Mrs. Mortimer request-   70      MARIAN  WALLACE. ed to see her. With trembling steps she again entered the chamber of her dying friend. You, who have sat by the death-bed of an idol- ized relative or beloved friend, and have watched the 'parting breath growing shorter and shorter as the sufferer neared the river's brink; you, who have pressed your lips to the brow cold with the dew of the grave, can feel for the afflicted Miss Woolsey-about to lose an affectionate and valued friend, whose friendship was tested by more than a quarter of a century's duration-herself ill the decline of life, and the last of her race. With Mrs. Mortimer, Marian seemed the hard- est to resign. She requested that she might be brought to her again. Poor child, she heard every thing that transpired in that sick room. She had taken he  Iton by the door, and hearing her name mn  ed, she entered, and glided to the bed, and 1id her cheek close to that of Mrs. Mor- timer. "Marian, bless you! God bless my or- phan!"All was still. The screams of the child recalled the spirit about taking its flight to the realms of glory; and with a strength almost super- human, she passed her arms tightly around the child, kissed her young face, and distinctly utter- ed the words, "God bless my orphan!"All was   MARIAN  WALLACE.       71 hushed; every knee bowed around that bed. With the child pressed close to her bosom, her spirit fled to the God who gave it. Poor thing! so young to know earthly sorrows. Surely thou art a child of prayer; twice in thy young existence have dying lips been closed in prayer in thy behalf. r     72      MARIAN   WALLACE. CHAPTER V. "An exile ill in heart and frame, A wanderer weary of the way; A stranger without love's sweet claim On any heart, go where I may." MRS. OSGOOD. Mis. LESLIE was the first that recovered suffici- ently to have Marian removed; but on the attempt being made, she became perfectly unmanageable, and could not be quieted until Miss Woolsey laid her gentle hand on the now frantic child, pressing her to her aching heart, soothing her as well as she could in the agitated state of her own mind. She caught a glance of the haughty iye of Mrs. Leslie, which caused her to tremble for the future well-being of the lovely child. The more she re- flected on it the more unhappy she became. She was aware, however, that it would be utterly im- possible for her to remain, an idle spectator of Marian's future unhappiness; all she could do was to soothe the disconsolate little one, and encourage   MARIAN  WALLACE.       73 her to submit patiently to the chastening rod of her heavenly Father. What a relief it was to her in this distressing 'hour, that Mrs. Mortimer had provided for the dear creature so destitute of earthly friends. She talked to Marian of God's protecting care of all , his creatures, and how orphans were especially cared for and protected by I{im; for in his Holy Word he hath written: "Leave thy fatherless chil- dren unto mhe and I will be a father, saith the Lord." "Did not your mother," said Miss Woolsey to Marian, "rely on God's protecting care, and com- mit you to Iiml whose watchful ear is ever ready to hear, and who will provide for the wants of all his children? Did He not provide for you a mother in the person of Mrs. Mortimer, whom He has called to Himself? Is He. not still able to supply her place?" In soothing the child, AMiss Woolsey became more composed herself; she laid Marian down and entreated her to try and sleep. Nor did she leave her until she slumbered peacefully. Kneeling down, she poured out her heart to God in hell behalf. Her mind was deeply exorcised on account of that innocent one. She knew that, in all probability, she must be separated from her. As her income : ' * "4 I.. v   "     MARIAN  WALLACE. was small, it would prevent her joining the society she had hitherto moved in through the kindness of Mrs. Mortimer who had prevented her from using any of it, since she had become a permanent resident with her. She felt how important, it was for her to decide quickly on the mode of living most congenial to her taste. Knowing the estab- lishment would be broken up, she wished to be ready, before it became necessary for the heirs to announce to her their desire for, her removal. She retired to her room, in order to write to a dear friend an account of the afflicting dispensa- tion she had been called upon to pass through, and to acquaint her with the necessity of retiring from the scene where she had passed so many years in peace and security, in the society of her beloved friend, and requesting to Fknow if it would be convenient to have her a resident in her family, until she could decide where her permanent resi- dence should be. Having written this sad intelligence to her friend, she joined the family in the dining-room. Course after course was removed untouched. The very tread of the attendants echoed the sadness of the heart. Mr. Carleton had not yet arrived, though the death of Mrs. Mortimer had been duly an- nounced. There was a nervous restlessness in the   manner of lMrs. Leslie that accorded ill with the customary dignity of her bearing. All seemed so much occupied with their own thoughts that the child was forgotten, and when brought to remem- brance she was nowhere to be found.  The ser- vants were sent out in every direction in search of the missing one. The shades of night were gathering around, ani- mated nature diffusing a quiet calm; all things seemed to yield to its soothing influence. This stillness was unbroken in Eden Grove, save by the echo of the stealthy tread of its inhabitants, as they wended their way along the corridor, to an- swer orders given in a voice, whose subdued tones told that the mighty conqueror had taken up his abode among them; Every step brought the anx- ious Miss Woolsey from her room, in the hope that they had found the missing one, and as often her heart sank within her; for they could get no tid- ings anywhere of the wanderer. It was impossible to think of retiring. What was she to do? Where was she to send? The child had never been out- side the domain alone. This state of suspense was dreadful. She determined to address the throne of mercy for direction. With a heart filled with earthly sorrow, she presented her petition to Him who knows all our sorrows, and is acquainted with   76 a     MARIAN  WALLACE. all our griefs, that He would lend a listening ear in this trying hour, and direct her as to the course most proper to pursue. She had just risen from her knees, when the faithful old butler entered, the tears coursing down his aged cheeks. "Well, Thomas, have you heard any tidings 2" "O no, dear Miss Woolsey; nothing has been heard of her; we have even dragged the pond. All efforts have been useless, and I have come to you to know what we shall do." "Nothing can be done till morning, my good Thomas; Mr. Carleton and Mr. Leslie will be here then, I hope. Try and compose yourself to rest." "Miss Woolsey, don't you think it strange Mr. Carleton has-not arrived? You know how much he professed to think of Mrs. Mortimer when living." "Thomas, I think nothing would have kept him away but indisposition." "Then, Miss Woolsey, he would have written." "He may have written to Mrs. Leslie. She is the heiress, and the person to address." "True, Miss Woolsey; but it is hard to consider a stranger the head of this establishment." "Thomas, it will not long be one; it will be   MARIAN WALLACE.        " broken up. All the associations with it must'be dissolved." "Miss Woolsey, will you and Marian leave these peaceful walls? Shall we, who have grown gray in the service of our beloved mistress?" "Even so, I fear, my faithful Thomas. Mrs. Leslie certainly will not be willing to incur much unnecessary expense; but when the will is read, we shall be informed what her wishes are. And now, Thomas, I want you to rest-it is past mid- night-that you may be able to endure the fa- tigues of to-morrow." Bidding her a respectful good-night, Thomas re- tired, and Miss Woolsey was left to solitude and her own thoughts. Throwing herself down on the bed without undressing, she fell into a disturbed sleep, from which she was awaked by some one begging her to get Lup. Arising from her troubled slumber, she could with difficulty understand the maid, who was begging her to come to Mrs. Mor- timer's room. She followed' her mechanically. The first pale tint of rosy morn was gilding the eastern sky when she entered the chamber of death., The shutters having been opened, the maid beck-,' oned her to approach. There lay the missing child, one arm around the neck, another pressed. under the head, her jetty ringlets veiling the face of the   l 78      MARIAN  WALLACE. departed. They lifted her gently, without disturb- ing her slumbers, and bore her to the room of Miss 'Woolsey. She was almost as cold as the in- animate form she had pressed. What a relief it was to Miss Woolsey's mind to know  that she was safe. She must have gone to Mrs. Mortimer's room as soon as she found herself alone on awak- ing; her affectionate heart must have longed to press that dear form again undisturbed. There she had slept, unconscious of the many hearts made anxious by her absence. It will be necessary to explain how it was pos- sible she could have remained unseen. It was the custom among the aristocratic portion of the com- munity, to close the room on the remains of all they held dear, wliile the necessary arrangements for the funeral were taking place. In that silent chamber they remained one, two, three, or four days, visited occasionally by the sorrowing friends. The affectionate creature who had found Marian, had entered the room and opened the shutters, to look upon the face of her beloved mistress, before engaging in her accustomed duties. No one had thought of going there to look for Marian; as childhood evinces such a dread of death, it was not thought probable that they would find her there.   MARIAN WALLACE.        79 Marian awoke in a raging fever, and in her de- lirium she raved continually about Mrs. Mortimer's being so cold. "Dear Mrs. Mortimer," she would say, "I will lie close to you and keep you warm." It was evident what had induced her to remain- the endeavor to resuscitate her beloved friend. Poor little thing! never will she behold that form again. Ere she recovered consciousness it was laid in the silent tomb. On the night of the eighth day after her de- cease, the remains of Mrs. Mortimer were borne from Eden Grove, amid the flickering light of torches, and followed by numerous friends and mourning tenantry, to the tomb of her husband and his ancestors. They left her to her God, and returned to Eden Grove, where the different mem- bers of her family were assembled to hear the will read in their presence. Mrs. Leslie, of course, was the heiress of the es- tate, it being entailed property; all connected with the deceased, by the ties of consanguinity, were remembered by her; she had bequeathed small legacies to each. To Miss Woolsey she bequeathed Eglantine Cottage-a small rural dwelling. She was to select, from the furniture of Eden Grove, all that she herself might need. Mrs. Mortimer's wardrobe and jewelry, (except such as were con-   80      MARIAN WALLACE. sidered family jewels,) also were to be hers. To Campbell was left a life annuity. None were for- gotten. Now came the codicil to the will. "To Marian, the child of my adoption, I bequeath a sum sufficient,"-for what, reader!--to fit her for the refined society which was to become a ipart of her existence, and to enable her to maintain a high position through life? No, reader, not that, but a sum scarcely adequate to give her a plain English education. This ended the reading of Mrs. Mortimer's will. Miss Woolsey turned a searching look on the face of Mrs. Leslie that disconcerted the haughty lady, and she turned to address some remark to her husband, to avoid meeting the expression which she read in Miss Woolsey's countenance. Mr. Carleton was the first to congratulate Miss Woolsey on the improvement,in her worldly pros- pects, through the kindness of her deceased friend. "Mr. Carleton," replied Miss Woolsey, "My friend, Mrs. Mortimer, was honor itself,-that will is a slander on her memory." "'iHow so, my dear Miss Woolsey? You, I think, ought to be satisfied with your share of the pro- ceeds." "Mr. Carleton, hear me.  I have never been entirely dependent on Mrs. Mortimer's bounty. I   MAR1AiN 'WALLACE. 8.  have a sufficiency to secure an humble dwelling far from the turmoil of fashionable life, where I might retire, and spend the remainder of my days. I never had a grasping mind after the vanities of this world. I am perfectly satisfied with the posi- tion I occupy. Had I a great deal of this world's goods, it probably would unfit me for seeking the pearl of great price, which has been ny constant aim for many years. And gladly would I waive all claims to this newly acquired property." "In my favor, Miss Woolsey?" exclaimed Carle- ton. "Mr. Carleton; this is a very improper time for trifling. I would gladly resign it to Marian, who is both helpless and dependent. Mr. Carleton, I would ask, is that codicil a specimen of your very best advice to the late Mrs. Mortimer, in relation to the well-being of Marian?" "Miss Woolsey, you speak enigmatically; ex- plain yourself, so as to be understood." "If by an explanation I could remove the im- pediment, in the way of Marian's benefit, then gladly would I do so." Mr. Carleton did not consider it well to press the matter. Something might be brought forward to contest the now accepted will. He was very well convinced that Mrs. Mortimer had left no 4*   82      MAr 1t I AN WA L JA CE. writing to thlat effect; there was not a vestige of any thing tangible that the world could take hold of. But it would be very, unpleasant to have any doubts as to the legality of the will. He must, therefore, consult Mrs. Leslie, she being the heiress, on the propriety of having such feelings removed from Miss Woolsey's mind, and ascertain what were the grounds she had for such an assertion, as the will's being a libel on Mrs. Mortimer's memory. Miss Woolsey returned to the sick chamber of the now destitute Marian; she had awoke in her absence, and asked for her. "  dear Miss Wool- sey, I' am so glad you are cpnme. I had such. a fiightful dream ; I thought Mrs. Mortimer was dead." Again did it become Miss Woolsey's pain- ful duty to soothe and comfort the sick clild; and by the sick bed she formed the determination, to protect and cherish that tender plant, and fit her to bloom  in the garden above, at God's right hand. She felt that on her devolved the sowing of the seed, though others might water; and she trusted to God the yielding of the increase; and well did she know, that whoever trusted in Him were never betrayed.  Before stating her inten- tion to keep Marian herself, she determined to wait and see what provision would be' made for   I       3' MA RlAN WALLACE.     '  83 her. If the child became an inmate of Shirly Park, she would droop, and di  shse had receiv- ed a shock, which it would require the greatest kindness entirely to overcome. Every day seemed to cement the bond of love closer between Miss Woolsey and Marian, who could not realize the necessity there was for leav- ing Eden Grove.  Nor could Miss Woolsey en- tirely restrain the impetuosity of her temper from displaying' itsclf on several occasionss as differ- I ent articles of furniture were removed, to which she had attached childish importance. She pos- sessed veneration in a large degree, so that it seemed to her like sacrilege. that stranger hands should touch aught that she valued almost to idolatry. Her sensitive feelings were fiequently iwounded, causing her to speak and act in a very improper manner. Miss Woolsey felt that it would be a great relief to her mind when every thing was removed, as 'she had made arrangements to remain until then. Mrs. Leslie visited Eden Grove frequently, dur- ing the removal of the effects to Shirly Park. The habiliments of woe certainly enshrouded her fair form in ample profusion, and, if we might  judge by the garb of the wearer, her grief was ofiftlei most poignant character; yet the calm in-   84      MARIAN WArLLACE. difference she manifested in the minute scrutiny she made throughout Eden Grove, evinced a want of feeling which ill accorded with the badges of mourning she displayed. Outward appeaiances are but seldom the index of the heart.  Any little nick-nack to which Miss Woolsey seemed to at- tach. any value, from that moment became of in- :trinsic worthl to the selfish Mrs. Leslie. It was galling to her in the extreme to think that any article would escape her rapacious fingers; even the trifles bequeathed to the different members of her mother's household, were turned over and critically examined, and in some instances, articles of an inferior quality were given in their place. How meanly and contemptibly the possessors of. a selfish spirit perform the duties imposed on them!       o Mr. Leshe was not cognizant of the many un- ladylike traits of character exhibited by the wife he'adored. Painful would it have been to his manly and generous heart, to know that she would sanction, much, less commit, a dishonorable act. His kindness and attention to Miss Woolsey and the friendless little Marian, were like an oasis in the desert, for life to them was a dreary waste.

No, the shamrock, daisy, and cowslip, must pass into strange hands; and Marian must retire to Eglantine Cottage, with its miniature garden. She will sit in the quiet little parlor, looking out on the moss-roses, red and white, stretching their graceful stems to bid her good morning--her longing eyes being the firs to behold them peeping forth in all their quie ;loveliness-hoping that the dazzling beauty of their gay neighbor the damask-rose, may not en- gross all her attention.   86       MARIAN   WALLACE. CIIAPTER   VI. "And while in peace abiding Within a'sheltered home, We feel as sin and evil Could never, never, come; But let the strong temptation rise, As whirlwinds sweep the sea, We find no strength to 'scape the wreck Save, feeling God, in thee." MRS. HALL'S ALICE RAY. MARIAN was inconsolable when the time arrived for her to bid adieu to Eden Grove. The evening before the one appointed for their departure, Mr. and Mrs. Leslie  entered the apartment of Miss Woolsey.  Mrs. Leslie informed her that tie time had arrived, when she would be relieved of the charge of the little girl her dear mother had been so very kind to patronize, and that, out of respect to her memory, she would give the child. a hlome as long as she conducted herself properly. "Amy, my dear," said fMr. Leslie, "from    your remarks Miss Woolsey might be led to suppose, that it was our intention to give Marian a home   M ARIAN WALLACE.       87 from charitable motives, without any respect to the wishes of our departed mother. She will re- ceive, Miss Woolsey, the same advantages as one of my own children, in point of education; the amount left to her in our mother's will, I intend shall accumulate for her benefit, that on her coming of age she may not be entirely portionless." "Mr. Leslie, I have no idea of placing her in the school-room with my children," responded Mrs. Leslie. "And why not?" asked her husband; "she cer- tainly cannot contaminate our children. Has she not breathed the same atmosphere for many years?" "Well, Mr. Leslie, if you intend acting in so ridiculous a manner about the girl, are there not plenty of suitable institutions in town, where she may be educated, independent of my governess? You know how very fastidious she is about such things. However, if you prefer not sending her to town, there is Grace Hill, with every facility for teaching the young that could be desited." "Amy, this from you! I thought we had come to an amicable understanding on this point." Miss Woolsey sat indignantly listening to this matrimonial squabble, the subject of which was dear to her heart. She felt now was the time to speak, or lose the opportunity forever. Ad-   88      MARIAN  WALILACE:. dressing Mr. Leslie in as calm a manner as she could assume, she stated to him her wish to be- come the future guardian of the child, alleging as her reason, the desolate hours she must spend' deprived of her innocent prattle. Mrs. Leslie's brow became clouded, for her keen perception saw through the guise which Miss Woolsey proffered to, her gaze, yet she did not think it proper to withdraw it lest she might subject herself to an exposure of her feelings in relation to Marian. Silence she found best just at this juncture. Mr. Leslie urged Miss Woolsey to relinquish the thought of becoming the future protector of Marian; and finally it was arranged that she should remain with her for one year, and that at the expiration of that time it should be amicably arranged who should retain the guardianship. With a sorrowing heart Marian bade adieu to her happy home, the recollection of which, from this time, must be as a beautiful dream, whose tints would lend enchantment to the busy realities of life, when, weary and care-worn, she should re- tire, in the shady twilight, to revel in the memory of the past. How sad is the breaking up of old associations; how fondly the heart lingers around scenes where we have rested peacefully, and where every nook   :t      BfMARIAN 'WALLACE.       89 and corner has its tale of by-gone happiness, which must forever pass from our sight. Miss Woolsey felt the consolations of religion in this trying hour. With a mind exquisitely mould- ed, she had felt the peculiar pleasure that flows from sincere friendship,-that friendship which en- ables the possessor to appreciate it in others with- out suspecting its hollowness. It was a friendship such as this which was now dissolved by death; yet she bowed submissively, and kissed the rod which had inflicted the chastisement.  She left Eden Grove with the blessings and prayers of .the peasantry, whose cottages, in the time of sickness and affliction, had been always cheered with her presence; and, with Marian and a faithful attend- ant, retired to Eglantine Cottage. Here was a Christian character displayed in an humble walk and a well-ordered conversation. Morning and evening did her orisons ascend to Him who has redeemed us with his blood, that he would guard 1 and defend them from the assaults of Satan. Ma- rian's education was much neglected during this time, owing to the' delicate state of her health. The quiet of the cottage seemed to sadden her young mind; there was a melancholy shade pass- ing over the sunny existence of the child; it made her fretful and unhappy.   The affectionate Miss   90      MARIAN  WALLACE. Woolsey did not fill her large and loving heart. She loved her dear "aunty," as she now called Miss Woolsey, ardently clinging to her, as the ivy does to the oak, yet she often longed for more to share her love. It was not surprising that she felt so, having been so long, idolized' by all the in- mates of her late home. Mr. and Mrs. Leslie called often at the cottage; and Mrs. Leslie, in a great measure, descended from the pedestal of pride on which she lad been accustomed to stand, whenever she came in con- tact with Miss Woolsey, as she was no longer an object of jealousy, ingratiating herself with her mother. Marian and she were perfectly harmless now; there was no longer any thing to dread from their influence; it must, therefore, necessarily place her in an advantageous light in the estima- tion of the world, to recognize them in this friendly manner. The many warm and friendly invitations made to visit Shirly Park were declined by Miss Woolsey, who doubted the propriety of accepting them, on Marian's account, fearing to have her mix in scenes from which, in after life, she would be debarred; yet, as the time was fast approach- ing which would decide her future home, it might not be improper, Miss Woolsey thought, for her to see and decide for herself. The next invitation,   '-i     NMfARIAN WALLACE.        91 therefore, that was extended by Mrs. Leslie, was  accepted. At the Leslies' Miss Woolsey met Mr. Carleton, who avoided rather than sought her so- ciety. Marian was enraptured at again seeing Frank; they wandered, with their arms encircling each other, through the beautiful pleasure-grounds. Mrs. Leshe had seemingly become attached to k  the little fellow, sweet, interesting boy as he was, and bearing a remarkable resemblance to his mother; he had the same soft azure eye, and downy cheek, and her sweet, low musical voice, so pleasing to the ear. Altogether he was a noble youth, \with that warm generosity of heart which charaterized his grandfather. She could not bear his being brought up for the army, declaring his heart was entirely too gentle for a valiant soldier. During this visit Mrs. Leslie seemed pleased with Marian. She certainly seemed very interesting in Miss Woolsey's partial and affectionate eyes; there was an artlessness of manner in all he said and did that was very pleasing. Among the gentlemen of the family, she became a general favorite; they would mount her before them on horseback, and away she would go over hill and dale, while Frank was making every effort, with his little Shetland pony,' to keep pace with his Johnny Gilpin uncle. Going into the library one morning, after one i.'        .   92     MARIA N WALLACE. of these Gilpin races, she found Miss Woolsey in earnest conversation with a lady, and was about to retire when Miss Woolsey called her to come for- ward and see her friend Miss Harvey.  Marian had ever been taught to think of this lady with affectionate gratitude, as the person who had been the means of her finding such kind friends. She was received into the open arms of this kind and loving lady, and was pressed to her benevolent heart, yet no woird of welcome escaped the child, which surprised Miss Woolsey, knowing she had so often talked about her, and what she would say if she should ever see her; but now the time had arrived, she wept the feelings that she could not express; nor could she be brought into any thing like friendly familiarity with Miss Harvey. Her visit to Shirly Park was inf relation to Marian. Miss Woolsey having written at the time of Mrs. Mortimer's death, telling her in what way she ex- pected Marian would be disposed of, and subse- quently, of the arrangement that had been entered into, by which she was to remain with her for the ensuing year. The year being now about to ex- pire, Miss Harvey could not defei' her visit any longer, being very desirous to ascertain all particu- lars, and to put in her claim. Thus there were now three homes opened for the reception of this- ^   .*                MARIAN  WALLACE.       93 child of prayer. How fully verified in her case was this passage of Scripture: "I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor their seed begging bread." Miss Woolsey feared that she must now lose Ma- rian. -With Mr. and Mrs. Leslie she resolved to contest the point. But Miss Harvey was so good, kind, and amiable, that she knew it would be for the child's advantage to be with her; yet she could not bring herself to resign her without a struggle. Hlow often had she looked forward to her declining years,'when Marian would be her solace and stay, and when her youthful hand would be outstretched to guide her trembling steps? Would not those laughing eyes be sight to hers when they should have become dim?  Yes! nature felt the many pri- vations which must be her lot if she should lose the sunbeam of her cottagei Long and earnest was the conversation in the library, when they re- tired from tea that evening. Mrs. Leshe said lit- tle; it was evident her heart was not in it. Mr. Leslie warmed while he argued with his guests, as to the propriety of the child's remaining at Shirly Park. It was finally proposed, by Mrs. Leslie, that Marian should decide the matter herself, as she was old enougl to know what she must gain or lose 'by tie decision.   I "     MARIAN  WALLACE.  Miss Woolsey thanked her in her heart fior  e   j proposition. They retired to their respective rooms  to await the decision of the morrow. Miss Wool- sey had recourse to the living fountain from which  flow the issues of life, resting her cause ill the ' hands of Him who never has sent ally empty away.    hMrs. Leshe was rather afraid that the attention  which had been shown the child since sle had  been there, might have an undue weight on lhr    4 young mind, and cause her to decide to remain,    : which would be very provoking, as she had not;  the slightest desire to increase her family; and Mr. Leshe had such exailted sentiments of honor, that she feared she might receive all the benefits  of which she had been lately deprived.        : With Miss Harvey it was a real spirit of philan-  thropy that had induced, her to take sucl a long journey at this season of the year, to offer the lit- tle friendless orphan a home. Her income. being  small, she mupt necessarily deprive herself of many little delicacies, to which in her younger years she had been accustomed. So we see that each had her little anxiety hidden carefully in her bosom, banishing nature's sweet restorative. Unrefres ed,  they descended to the breakfast-parlor the follow- ing morning, to join Mr. and Mrs. Leslie. Anx- iously did they ;await the retiring of the attendants,   MAR IAN WALLJACE.       95 that they might resume the discussion of the pre- vious evening. Marian and Frank had\ hastily dispatched their breakfast, that they might enjoy the beauty of the white, crisping frost, ere the' sun's rays had dissolved it from their sight. Beautiful did the velvet lawn look, with its coverlet of sparkling whiteness; here and there dotted with green, as the genial rays of the sun had dissolved it into pearly drops of dew,-cnlarging these emerald spots, until they became one mass of living green. "'I-owm ysterious," said Marian, "'are the works of that unseen Power, who causes the rain and the fiost to descend, and cover the earth, while we repose in undisturbed slumber, perfectly uncon- scious of His omnipotent power, which governs the vegetable world, and upholds our very exist- ence at the same moment!7" "I can't understand His omnipresence," replied Frank. "When I hear our teacher, Dr. L-- , lec- ture on it, I ami lost in amazement." "Well, Frank," said Marian, "I don't often think about such things; but it seems to me, you do nothing but think and talk about what Dr. L- says. and does." "Marian, you know, before I went to the acad- emy, you knew much more about such things   96     MARIAN WALLACEJ.  than I did, and you often made me feel very   K much ashamed; and I determined, if I ever went  where such lessons were taught, I would certainly pay particular attention and remember them. Grandmamma don't like to hear me talk about what I learn on such subjects. When I tell her about my French and geography, she seems very  i much interested." '"'Well, Frank, I wish you would talk to me about your other lessons. It makes me sad to hear any one speak about such things-it reminds nme  of Eden Grove," and she burst into tears. Frank tried every way to soothe her; but in  the midst of her sea of tears, she was summoned into the presence of those assembled in the parlor., "Oh do dry your eyes; what will my grandpapa say if he sees you crying? He might think I had been unkind to you, and you know, dear Marian, I  do love you so. I am very sorry I said any thing to grieve you; do wipe your eyes, that's a dear, good girl. There is a fountain close by, in the garden, where you can wash them. I see grand- mamma standing there by the window; she does not look pleased. I wonder what they want you  for. Perhaps Miss Woolsey intends returning this morning;-if so, you wont forget Frank, in that little nutshell of a home of yours?"   MA1IAN  WALLACE.       97 Marian laughed at the idea of calling her home a nutshell. "' I would have you know, Mr. Frank," said she, "it is a very sweet home, if it is not so grand as yours, with its long, winding avenue, frightening one to death ;-when one looks through those great old trees, one can't see daylight over one's head. Why, I wouldn't exchange homes with you for all Shirly Park!" "Not to live with me, Marian?" "No, not'to live with you, Frank.  I would not leave my Aunty and Eglantine Cottage, though I love you very much." Marian looked excited when she entered the. room where sat her tried friends and her bitter enemy. "Did you send for me, sir?" said she, addressing Mr. Leslie, and glancing around, to see who were present. Her eyes met those of Miss Woolsey, beaming with love, which instantly relieved her from the embarrassment which she always felt when in the presence of Mrs. Leslie. "Marian," said Mr. Leslie, "we have sent for you to decide a question of some importance to your future well-being. I presume Miss Woolsey has already informed you of the provision in Mrs. Mortimer's will, by which you were to become an inmate of 'our family; though, in consequence of the delicate state of your health at the time of   98     MARIAN WALLACE. Mrs. Mortimer's death, it was deemed expedient to hlave you remain with our mutual friend Miss Woolsey, for the space of a' twelvemonth, and, at the expiration of that time, to decide as to your future residence. You are now old enough to un- derstand and appreciate the advantages you would necessarily derive from choosing Shirly Park as your future home; and I need not particularize farther than to say, that you will always find a place in my affections; for, from the first moment I beheld you, a friendless little thing, destined to be a performer in the great drama of life, I pledged myself to promote your interests in every way practicable." Mr. Leslie's benevolent face beamed with sympathy as he thus. addressed the little girl. Miss Woolsey feared for her, knowing the pride and impetuosity of her disposition, and dreading that her answer might alienate the benevolent sympathy Mr. Leslie expressed for her. She read in her countenance the withering scorn that was seeking expression from her lips, and begged Mr. Leslie to excuse any impetuosity of feeling she might give evidence of, as she had never adverted to the subject in her presence, owing to the shade of melancholy which had evidently hung over her young and buoyant spirits. She cared not that the t   J1      nrrMARIAN WALLACE.      99 shadow might be deepened by the knowledge of a probable separation. She might have erred, she said, in thus keeping her in ignorance of the mat- ter, but had thought "sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof," and that the shock, when it came, would be no more trying to her sensitive feelings, than would be a continual recurrence to the subject. Marian stood all this time with a flashing eye and a burning cheek; passion had changed the very lineaments of her countenance. "Mr. Leslie," said she, "my aunty has ever taught me to speak the truth, and I will not shrink from it now. I hate Mrs. Leslie; and I will not live with you. I have feared her always; so much so, 'that when she came to Eden Grove I was afraid to go to sleep. I like not the way she looks down upon me; it sends a cold, creeping chill all over me. Ask me not to leave my dear aunty, for I will not, and you cannot make me." Bursting into a pas- sionate flood of tears, she flung herself into her aunt's arms. Well was it for her that Mrs. Leslie, from motives definable only to herself, was opposed to her residing in her family; otherwise the fear- less manner in which she had declared her deter- mination not to reside with them, would have de- termined that lady to insist upon the fulfilment of Mr. Leslie's wish; as it was, there was manifest ex-   100     MARIAN  WALLACE. ultation on her countenance as she gazed on the troubled face of her husband. Marian had been betrayed into an exposure of the very worst traits of her character-pride and passion; and well did she know it would have an influence on her hus- band. Passion too exhibited in a child, she knew would detract much from the disposition he might feel to say any thing in its extenuation. Had she given utterance to her secret sentiments, she would have said: "Marian, you have lost your place in my husband's noble heart; you have brought about, in a mollent, what it would have been almost im- possible for me to accomplish; my power to con- trol your destiny has now been increased through your own instrumentality." But what cared Marian for this? Permitted to remain with Miss Woolsey, what cared she for los- ing the favor of one whom she had never loved? Less than nothing; too happy was she to escape the thraldom that would have been imposed on her. Mr. Leslie again addressed the little girl: "Ma- rian," said he, "reconsider the matter. Is this your final determination? You have disappointed me in giving way to a passion highly unbecoming. I will make every allowance in my power, and at- tribute it to your affection for Miss Woolsey-in itself' highly commendable; she has. given you   MARIAN  WALLACE.      101 every reason to love and respect her. I am glad to see you appreciate her kindness; it is a kind- ness which has flowed from a sincere interest in your welfare. Maygou never disappoint the hopes she now entertains; may you never cause her to regret the many privations she must subject her- self to on your account; may you soothe her de- clining years; may your passionate temper never cause her heart to bleed; may you be every thing to her her sanguine heart anticipates; but, above all things, may your young heart be early cleansed by the purifying influences of Christ's blood, ap- plied to the washing away of the least and last remains of sin." Marian stood like a culprit waiting to receive sentence. She had committed an error, the extent of which she could not comprehend; but she saw that Mr. Leslie and the Misses Iarvey and Wool- sey looked grieved. She had spoken the truth, it could not be that, she thought, for Miss Woolsey had ever taught her to speak the sentiments of her heart truthfully. What she had said was spoken in a quick passionate manner, with a sense of in- jury sustained; in what way her young mind could not particularize. It was this feeling which had been making its stealthy tread, and settling in un- mistaken gloom, on the hitherto sunny life of the   102     MARIAN  WALLACE. child. She had already learned that she was no longer the petted proteg& of the wealthy Mrs. Mor-  timer; young as she was she had seen those by whom she had been at one time kissed and fondled, pass her by without one look of recogni- tion. Miss Woolsey had shielded her as much as possible from such unpleasant recurrences, but had not been able to prevent her learning thus early a first lesson in the selfishness of the world; and as she stood listening toothe solemn words that were addressed to her by Mr. Leslie, the waves of insubordination were calmed, the passion of her young heart was staid, her upturned face looked pretty, with its shadow of youthful sorrow, as she bent her knee to beg his forgiveness for the im- proper manner in which she had spoken. She had felt very angry, she said, when he talked about taking her from her dear aunty, but assured him. she would do any thing to please, if he would only let her remain with her aunty at Eglantine Cottage. The silvery hair of Mr. Leslie mingled with the raven ringlets of Marian as he imprinted the first and last kiss on her youthful brow, pledging himself to the little maiden that henceforth he never would interfere, either directly or indirectly, in any way which would have a tendency to bring about   MARIAN WALLACE.       103 the separation of her and Miss Woolsey. He had pledged himself, and Marian relied implicitly on his word. She arose light-hearted, and pressed a fervent childish kiss on the lips which had con- tributed so unspeakably to her happiness. She ever afterwards retained an affectionate veneration for him. Delicacy, suggested the propriety of Miss Wool-  sey bringing her visit to a termination, but Mr. and Mrs. Leslie were urgent that she should re- main until the expiration of Miss Harvey's visit, which would be in the early part of the following week. She was consequently induced to prolong her stay. Gladly, however, did she return to her quiet little cottage, secluded from the turmoil of the busy multitude who jostled against each other in the crowded pathway of life. With Marian as her own, and at peace with her God, she content- edly passed the day. Night saw them gathered around the family altar-a loving, happy household. None were forgotten in the humble, earnest petition that ascended to the King of kings. ",f While the inmates of the cottage were reposing in peaceful security, how was it with the inhab- itants of Shirly Park?        . ; .                 . i 1    104      MARIAN  WALLACE. CHAPTER   VII. "The only amaranthine flower on earth Is virtue; th' only lasting treasure-truth." COWPERS' TASK. RumoR had wafted its intelligence  across the mighty deep, of the unkindness of Stanhope to his lovely wife-of his desertion of her in a garrison exposed to every temptation. There might be seen the afflicted father and mother pacing their cham- ber in agony of mind bordering on despair, for the fate of their lovely child. Stanhope had been running a continual round of dissipation, from the time of his reconciliation with the family of his wife; his passion for gambling was undiminished; his nights were principally spent at the gaming-table, while Flora was left with no society but that of her little girls, and that of an artful, designing maid, a creature of Stanhope's, ready to sacrifice her own reputation and that of her mistress. In this state of things to whom  could she un-      MARIAN WALLACE.        105 bosom her grief? Her beloved grandmother was no more. Pride prevented her complaining to her parents. How could she make known to them that she was reaping the reward of her credulity? and was he not her husband? Had her father not taught her, that every fault of a husband ought to be concealed from the world? But was that world so indifferent to the conduct of that hus- band? No! it had discovered his most secret sins, committed' against that lovely being. The voice of censure had been loud in condemning the con- duct of the libertine, who could unblushingly in- troduce the creature of his pleasure into the society of his pure wife. How would words of sympathy have soothed this heart of anguish, alone in ai for- eign land, without one female friend to whom she could unbosom  herself? Suddenly, her faithful nurse was recalled to attend her foster-sister, whose constant cry was, "O, that my mother would re- turn; that I might breathe my last on her loving bosom." Flora could not withstand such an ap- peal. She was devotedly attached to this foster- sister. Iad it not been for the love she bore her children, gladly would she have exchanged situa- tioins. Death, to her, would have been a relief from her earthly disappointments and sorrows; but then her children, two sweet girls, and her darling, idol- 5* t    106     MARIAN  WALLACE. ized Frank. Oh how her tempest-tossed bark was buffeted by he waves of affliction, without the consolations of religion to support her in this hour- of trial! Had her education been other than it was; had the influences which had been brought to bear on her unsophisticated mind, been of a character to strengthen and ennoble the qualities of her heart, her depression of mind would not have led to such fatal consequences; she would then have been 'able to resign herself to the keeping of that God who said: "The very hairs of your head are numbered,"--but as it was, there was no helm to guide the tempest-tossed bark to the haven of peace. She would have derived some consolation, had she felt that her parents sympAtlized with her, though it was out of, their power to ameliorate her condition; as she had not applied to them, ,nothing was left for them but to wait until their interference was solicited. After all, what they had heard might be nothing but a rumor, though the source whence they had received the painful intelligence, almost precluded the possibility of such a hope. There was one in that distant land, who had watched with intense anguish, Stanhope's desertion of his lovely wife, who had gazed on the receding   RI     tMARIAN  WALLACE.      107 bloom of health, as it departed from the young mother's cheek, and who had remonstrated with him on the culpability of his conduct. "Why, in the name of all that is honorable, not sue for a divorce," said this friend to Stanhope,-"if you no longer love her?" "Sue for a divorce, indeed! a pretty fool you must take me for, Bristow! No, no, my dear fel- low, nothing of the kind. I mean to keep her, to replenish my coffers, when exhausted. Don't you know I love my Juliet too fondly for that? Were I to get the divorce which your unbounded gen- erosity prescribes, what should I have, to furnish my adored with necessary funds, but mypay and hazard at play? Are you such an ignoramus as not to understand my drift? -Well, knowing you tto be a clever fellow, but a little too particular for my code of honor, I will just inform you of my in- tentions,-but not one word on the subject. I fully understand that I have a perfect piece of propriety for my wife. I honor and respect her for it. She is the mother of my children, but love her I never did. Before I ever saw her, I had formed an at- tachment for my dark-eyed divinity, which was re- turned with passionate ardor, as she has given con- vincing proofs. To marry my dark-eyed divinity was farthest from my intentions, as she was as   MARIAN  WALLACE. poor as myself. We comprehended the relation wlich we sustained to each other; she being as extravagant as myself. I saw Flora, and married her, simply to enable me to discharge my debts and support my Juliet in a handsome- manner. The first years of our wedded life, the old papa held his purse-strings tight, which prevented c from fulfilling my intentions; but, thanks to his extravagant tenderness for Flora, my wants have,  been lately well supplied, and my Juliet revels in all the wealth her beauty entitles her to, without j confining me entirely to her chariot wheels; so you see it would be impolitic in me to follow your advice. Acknowledge that I am a good tac- tician." "Acknowledge that you are a consummate vil- lain," was on the lips of Bristow; but he suppress- ed thlb words, knowing how useless it would be to quarrel with his superior officer. There were other reasons that tended to keep him silent. The thought of being able to ameliorate Flora's con.  dition, strengthened his determination to write to his friends something of her suffering and patience,  and it was from this source that her parents had received this unpleasant intelligence of the situa- tion of their child. Daily had Bristow seen, and heard, the morti-   MARIAN  WALLACE.      109 fication she was called to endure; his sympathy for Mrs. Stanhope was sincere, but his daily inter- course with her ad but too much strengthened the sentiments he had entertained for her, ere she became the partner of the man whose principles he repudiated; but the utter loathing which took possession of his mind, after hearing him, express the motives which had actuated him in selecting one whom he would have been too happy to have called his'own; to see her, day after day, endure  the most humiliating wrong, without expressing one unkind word toward the author of all her suffering, made him feel grateful, when, by any little token of kindness, he could recall the sunny smile to illumine her beautiful face, now pale with mental anguish. Since his return, Bristow had been in the habit of calling daily on Flora. As soon as his health permitted, he had availed him- self of the vacancy made by Stanhope's promotion, to resume the command of the brave fellows who were formerly under his charge: and never was an officer's return hailed with such demonstrations of joy. On his arrival, it required his utmost exer- tions to prevent them from actually carrying him firom the vessel to the barracks. Not that Stan- hope had treated them cruelly or unkindly; he was a good commander; but Bristow they idol-   "O     MARIAN  WALLACE. ized. At the time of his arrival, Stanhope felt proud to exhibit the charms of his beauteous wife; yet, when he discovered the fascinating pleasure his friend experienced in her society, he almost regretted the privilege he had extended. Now that Bristow formed one of the number, never for- getting the sentiments he formerly entertained for her, he almost dreaded his nearer approach to his beautiful wife, knowing him to be so extremely fascinating when in the society of ladies. Stanhole had never sought to explore the mine of wealth which he knew was in the heart of his wife. She was of too calm a nature to act as a stimulant on his passionate temperament; still he could not bear the idea of another's enjoying the wealth of affection which he considered it too much trouble to retain, after it became his own; and he expe- rienced a feeling of mortification, as Bristow's per- sonal appearance was much inferior to his own; and, could he have absented himself from  the gaming-table, to enjoy the society of his wife, he would soon have been fully reinstated in her af- fections. But he plunged deeper into dissipation, and gave her continual cause of complaint, absent- ing himself for weeks, and even months, from his home.

NMARIAN WALLACE.    ll the manner in which you fulfil the vows plighted at the altar, when woman yields herself entirely to your care; how many happy and honored house- holds would there be, did you but fulfil all the requirements of that solemn compact! Not that the husband is always the aggressor, for there are spirits so uncongenial as almost to preclude the possibility of their happiness in the marriage rela- tion, even if man had retained his primeval estate. Flora had never presumed to remonstrate with Stanhope on the course he was pursuing, well knowing how futile any effort on her part would be, to win him from the error of his way. All she had done was, to refrain from burdening him with complaints; but his conduct had become so flagrant, his unkindness so often repeated, that her silence ceased to be a virtue. However, she was startled, on one occasion, into a reiteration of her wrongs, highly disagreeable to the ear of her guilty husband. He heard her in silence, until the vehemence of her feelings had subsided, when, in a voice of thun- der, he asked: "Is it you, madam, who presume to lecture your husband on the impropriety of his conduct, who is a daily witness to the impropriety of yours? Do you not, daily, allow Bristow free access to your boudoir, without my sanction? Are iJ   "2     MARIAN WALLACE. not your evenings spent in his society? Yet you dare to question my right to dispose of ry time in the society which is most congenial to me. Do you not dispense with the attendance of your maid, that she may not be cognizant of the time when you think proper to retire? Think you that I have remained uninformed of your most trivial acts? No; from the moment I absented myself from my home, I have had a faithful account of every hour you spent in the society of BriOtow. Now, hear me, madam! The first time you, utter one word of complaint in my ear, I will blazon abroad your disgrace by calling Bristow out. Now, mark me, for I swear it!" "'Hold, Stanhope; you have said enough," said Flora, drawing herself up to her full height. "I know your capabilities of deception; think you I have forgotten how you induced me to abscond from my father's roof in such a manner as to make it appear that I was accessory to the flight? Think you I have forgotten the part you played in the presence of my beloved grandmother? Can I for- get the many causes which have made life a bur- den to me?-how I have wept and sighed for the sympathy that was denied me, by one who now stands ready to herald to the world my seeming inconstancy-seen through eyes blinded by a base   MARIAN  WALLACE.      113 infatuation. Shall I, a daughter of a Mortimer and a Leslie, meekly yield to your false assertion? No! By 'the pride which has hitherto sustained me; by the contempt I now entertain for you; do I spurn your presumptuous threat, as unfit to make one impress on the tablet of my memory!" Stanhope was not prepared for such an outhurst of feeling from his hitherto passive wife. He had asserted, in vindication of his own conduct-with a view to intimidate her and to prevent any re- currence to the subject-an impropriety 'on her part calculated to humble even the most arrogant. He did not foresee the contrary effect that would be produced on the quiet spirit of his wife, and that she would be roused by it; to assert her rights. He thought to allay the storm by redoubling the accusation, but in this he had been disappointed; and on the contrary, had made the discovery that she was not without a portion of her mother's spirit. O man, couldst thou have permitted the voice of conscience to sound its alarm in thy guilty ear, what seas of tears wouldst thou have prevented flowing from eyes already surcharged with grief! But, intent on the gratification of thy own guilty passion, thou didst goad the wife of thy bosom to madness, so that when Bristow was announced, which was shortly after the stormy interview, she   "4     MARIAN  WALLACE. was unable to preserve her equanimity when she saw the anxiety depicted in his countenance as he approached to pay his morning salutation. The revelation of her sorrow threw him entirely off his guard, so much so, that he then and there de- clared the sentiments which he had so long enter- tained, but had carefully concealed, lest by any inadvertence on his part, the knowledge of them might be conveyed to her: "Dear, dear Flora," he exclaimed,' 'ou have ever been the object of my fondest solicitude; without the power of alle- viating your sufferings I have made them my own.  Spurn me not from  your presence, dear Flora; after this revelation, let me but remain a silent spectator of how patiently you endure your wrongs, and I promise faithfully never to breathe again one word of this unfortunate attachment. O that we had met before those indissoluble vows were plighted, and I had been permitted to declare the ardor of my attachment. Fatal hour! that permitted an insidious voice to charm your ear! Flora, your children's tender years need a mother's solicitude; the honor of your family demands the closing of your heart against those sentiments which are arising from this acknowledged affection, and which will be your inevitable ruin." Flora knew all this, but the: language of affection   .            .  .   ("X    MARIAN  WALLACE.      115 was soothing in her present state of mind; and  when she retired to her own chamber. and com- muned with her heart, she discovered how necessary Bristow had become to- her happiness, and how pain- !  ful it was to think that it was necessary she should no longer receive his attentions. But why, thought she, should. this be necessary? Had not Stanhope charged her with unfaithfulness? and could she be otherwise in his estimation? Would he not carry out his threat; and on the very first opportunity declare her no longer fit to preside at his board or conduct the education of his children? In that case what would her mother think; and what would her dear father say? Had. not his fatal pro- phecy been verified, and the hallucination ended in the discovery that she no longer loved Stanhope? She was aroused from this revery by her hus- band presenting himself, and announcing his de- termination to dine at home,-a thing unheard of for many months. What was she to do? It was probable he would insist upon her appearing at table, which, in the present state of her mind, she felt was impossible; but, should she refuse, it was not improbable he would adopt compulsory meas- ures. She determined to support her dignity, at all events, whatever course he should pursue. As she had expected, Stanhope demanded her presence in At   "6     MARIAN WALLACE. the most peremptory manner. A haughty and re- taliating answer struggled for utterance, but she calmly yielded to her attiring woman, perfectly in- different as to her appearance. Her face and form were such as required little aid from art; her toilet was therefore soon arranged. Descending with as calm a bearing as she could assume to the drawing-room, where she expected to meet the guests of her husband, she found him alone. Fear threw its icy mantle around her beating heart,-a fear she could not define. Did .he understand the feeling by which she had been agitated during his absence; and was he now going to declare his knowledge? Never did a felon's eye quail before that of his judge, as did Flora's before that of her husband, when he presented his arm, coldly and silently, to escort her to the dinner-table. When the cloth was removed, the children began to amuse themselves, perfectly unconscious how soon, a moth- er's fostering care would be withdrawn from their young and beauteous forms. They were sweet buds of loveliness, that required a mother's eye to de- tect which was Emma and which was Caroline. Stanhope was really fond and proud of these chil- dren, whom he would laughingly declare he never could tell apart. While he was sipping his wine in an abstracted    it 1hMARIAN WALLACE.           117 manner, totally regardless of the presence of his wife, the evening mail brought dispatches from dif-: firent quarters, and among them one from Flora's parents, urging Stanhope to permit her and her children to spend the winter at Shirly Park. Noth- ing could be more opportune than this invitation; it would give him time to mature his plans. But. to Flora this invitation was fraught with pain, for it invoked a separation from Bristow, just when she   discovered how fondly she had loved him, and  ardently her love was returned. She knew how criminal it was to entertain such sentiments; but, had not her husband, she thought, thrown back all her wealth of affection, as worn and useless? What could she do to prevent this dreaded visit? Iow could she appear in the presence of her pa- rents? Under the influence of such an unholy at- tachment, would not the quick eye of her mother detect the passioni which had obtained such an ascendency over the mind of her unhappy child? Unhappy would she be, even to acknowledge to herself the reciprocation of Bristow's love. Many, many days was Flora's mind disquieted, nor could Bristow's oft-reiterated vows of love and constancy, chase the foreboding gloom from her mind. Foreboding!  Hast thou not entered the circling eddy? Art thou not on the verge of the    "8  i  MARIAN  WALLACE. maelstrom, whose waters will engulf and over- whelm thee  Retire ere it be too late.

Another step, and - thy doom is inevitable; no voice of sympathy will reach thee in thy fallen state. Stop and guard thyself with the shield of propriety, and let not thy time-lonored family bow its head in shame, for the disgrace of its daughter. O Flora, Flora, great will be thy fall! Flora saw not, heard not, the warning, for in an hour of trial and tempta- tion she fell, and by-her the escutcheons of her honorable ancestors were draped in disgrace. - I ,   I; .       .MAR IAN  WALLACE.       119  CHAPTER VIII. "O grave, what woe is wrought by thee, What clouded years of misery; What loving hearts hast thou bereft, What joyless, hopeless mourners left; Young innocence without a guide, Beset with snares on every side." MARY HOWITT. TaE first intimation that reached   Shirly Park of the stain on the family, was a letter from  Stan- hope, written on the eve which preceded the time appointed by his second for the expiation of his wrongs on the person of Bristow.    Should he not survive the fire of his antagonist, he wrote, his second would furnish all necessary details. But Bristow would not raise his arm   against the man whom  he considered  he had injured.   Stanhope again wrote, stating the necessity for the presence of her father immediately, in order to make arrange- ments for the removal of his daughter; as it was impossible she should continue to have the care of her children; and urging' that the sooner she   120     MARIAN WALLACE. was taken home, the sooner could the prelimi- naries be entered into for obtaining a divorce. What were the effects of these overwhelming tidings on Mr. Leslie? He was prostrated by them on a bed of sickness, from which, to all human appearance, he would never rise. And what was the deportment of the haughty mother, under this weight of family disgrace? Sternly and silently, but with a blanched cheek, did she minister to the wants of her suffering husband. Not a sound of complaint was heard from those haughty lips, com- pressed with anguish too deep for utterance. She moved like a spectre among her household-no duty was neglected; but in the silent night, when hid from prying eyes, she yielded to her woman's na- ture, by indulging in the luxury of uncontrolled grief. Each morning, however, saw her prepared  to take her accustomed place by the side of her invalid husband. She was relieved from the polite condolence of her sunshine friends, as hers was an affliction that precluded all form of sympathy, save silence. Her true friends, as they gazed on the heroic fortitude with which she sustained herself,  could not but admire it. It was she who arranged matters for the departure of Miss Woolsey and Carleton ;-Carleton as her legal adviser, and Miss Woolsey as protector to the children, who were to   MARIAN  WALLACE.      121 reside with her until the divorce was granted. She had turned to Miss Woolsey for sympathy in this hour of affliction, as the fittest person among all her friends, to protect her grandchildren. Among all her treasured five hundred friends, with whom she had flitted away her butterfly existence, not ode was found adequate to the charge. How beautiful did the Christian character of Miss Woolsey appear in becoming partner, in that er- rand of mercy, with Carleton, whom she had every reason to despise. He could not act a double part with the children of Stanhope. He dared not breathe an improper thought in the ear of his pat- roness now. Were they not bone of her bone? He was well able to advise in this delicate matter, with his clear judgment, and perfect insight into human nature. Mrs. Leslie could not have selected a more competent agent ; and well did he know with whom he had to deal. However unpleasant the task, he would be compelled to go through with it; he had sold himself entirely to Mrs. Leslie's interest. With this man for a companion, Miss Woolsey found herself embarked on the stormy waters of the Bay of Biscay, whose tumultuous billows swell- ed over the foamy track of the vessel, as she plowed her way to her destined haven. Sublime were the feelings of Miss Woolsey, as she surveyed the works 6   122     AMARIAN  WALLACE. of that Almighty power who holds the waters in  the hollow of His hand. Infinite, she thought, was. the power :that set bounds to those proud waves, and said, "Thus far shall ye go, and no farther." "At the word of the omniscient God," said she to  herself, "the swelling billows roll back; and will not the waves of human affliction yield also to that mighty voice Oh that Flora's heart, dead in tres- passes and sins, might be quickened-by the reviv- ing influence of the Holy Spirit. May the Sun of righteousness arise, with healing on his wings, for her poor wounded heart," was the prayer of this humble Christian. Dearly did she love the erring one, who had been so cruelly led' astray; she felt that she could take her to her arms and, if possi- ble, wipe the stain away. For Stanhope she had not the same depth of feeling. Though she liad  not heard the rumors that were in circulation rela- tive to his conduct, she had seen enough of him, while in the house of Mrs. Mortimer, to convince her what would be the character he would assume when relieved from the affectionate eyes with which he was surrounded.  Whle there, many times  had she surprised Flora in tears, for some un- kind reproof of her husband. By that husband she was now to be informed of all that had trans- pired. She determined, however, not to become  A*   MARIAN  WALLACE.       123 his guest. Mrs. Leshe had not restricled ler on that point. She resolved to seek Flora out, and, from her own lips, hear a statement of the influ- ences which had been brought to bear on her mind, and afforded a pretext for the, heinous sin which she had committed.  On their arrival, Carleton was very much sur- prised, when she announced her determination to go immediately to a hotel, and there await the pres- ence of Stanhope. Many were the private inter- views between Stanhope and Carleton, but it seemed an impossibility that any negotiation could be en- tered into, owing to the selfish and avaricious spirit of Stanhope, who was unwilling to lose, his hold on Mr. Leslie's munificent benefits, by resigning the unhappy Flora. It was her father's earnest desire that the preliminaries of a divorce, of which Stan- hope had written, should be entered into as speed- ily as possible; and to have his daughter removed from under the control of a man whom  he con- sidered the cause of all this heavy affliction; and Carleton had been invested with full power and authority to bring this unhappy business to a con- clusion as soon as possible. But when Stanhope proposed, for a certain sum, to withdraw the suit, and restore her' to her position, the wily lawyer found a problem which he had not expected to   124     MARIAN WALLACE. have to solve. It therefore became necessary to refer the proposed offer to the parents of the un- happy wife. While waiting for the decision to this unex- pected proposition, Miss Woolsey had been unre- mitting in her attention to the unfortunate Flora, whom she found feelingly alive to the deplorable- ness of her situation. Deeply humbled by a clear view of the heinousness of the crime she had com- mitted; patiently waiting the decision which must send her an outcast from nall she held dear, with disgrace cngraven on her forehead, her language was: "Where shall I hide from my fellow-beings? Could I find a place where the foot of man never trod, gladly would I retire there to mourn my fall; but my children! who will teach them to love their Creator in the days of their youth, that they may shun the path their unfortunate mother has chosen  Who will lead them by the hand to the house of God, where they may hear the story of the cross, and God's unbounded love to mankind? -who willeth not the death of any, but that all may turn from the error of their ways and live. Oh, had I been taught to love and reverence his holy commandments, I should not be the outcast I now am. But let me not cast reflections on the authors of my being; let me not add to their al-   -i     MARIAN WALLACE.       125 ' ready accumulated weight of woe, by reflecting on the manner in which they chose to conduct my education, and fit me for heaven or hell. But Oh, my children! may they be led to recline on the bank of the river of life, and rest secure in the promises of an unchanging God, though I am my- self unable to lay hold of one of them." ":But Flora," said Miss Woolsey, "have you for- gotten that beautiful promise, 'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall become white as snow?' Do you not remember the thief on the cross? Have you forgotten Saul of Tarsus?" ' But, M[iss Woolsey, they sinned not against the light, which we who live in the nineteenth cen- tury enjoy, who have the full blaze of gospel light in a risen Lord; they had lived by types and shadows of his coming." Miss Woolsey informed her of what provision was being made for her children by their grand- parents-how they were to remain for a time at Eglantine Cottage; and she added, "You know every thing a mother's love could dictate, I will endeavor to fulfil." "I know it, my kind friend," replied Flora, "and that relieves my mind of much anxiety." "How long they will remain under my charge,   126     MARIAN  WALLACE. depends entirely on the feelings with which they are received by your parents." "Oh that they could always remain under the peaceful shelter of your quiet cottage; under your care, I know the influences of religious teaching will be brought to bear on their young minds." Miss Woolsey neglected no opportunity of pour- ing the consolation which cometh from above, on the stricken heart of the wanderer from the paths of rectitude. The answer to Stanhope's proposition was received by Carleton; it was couched in terms of unmitigated contempt, for a wretch who could permit such a proposition to offend the ears of the parents of his unfortunate wife; and dxpressed a, strong desire that the suit now pending should be carried through as speedily as circumstances would permit; proposing at the same time, that the grand- parents should keep the children, until Stanhope could find a more convenient home for them. In relation to their miserable daughter, it was their wish, her parents said, that she should retire to a small village, in the west of England, where they had made arrangements for her reception, in the family of a poor but pious clergyman, and where her necessary wants would be provided for, through an agent. The letter closed with an urgent request, that Miss Woolsey would return as soon as possible.   MARIAN WALLACE.        127 Flora's mind was relieved from a. load of anxiety when she learned the decision her parents had come to, as to her place of destination; the idea of encountering her mother had weighed heavily on her overcharged mind. She had not the slight- est knowledge of the family in which she was to become an inmate, nor had she been informed on what footing she was to be received in it. Miss Woolsey, Carleton, and the children, trav- elled with the unhappy mother; and she much needed the society of friends, to mitigate in some degree her perpetual banishment from her loved ones; Just as the plank was withdrawn from the ves- sel which contained this sorrowing group, a muffled figure demanded to be received on board. There was something in his bearing which. appeared familiar to Miss Woolsey; but she could not re- call when a  whehere seen. The circumstance was not sufficient in itself to warrant her mentioning it to Carleton. It almost escaped her memory during the voyage, not having encountered the ob- ject whch, for a moment, had recalled memory to aid her in the recollection. It was not until seated in the public conveyance, where they had takeni seats on their arrival, to convey Flora to her destined home, that she again discovered the   128    ' MARIAN  WALLACE. same muffled figure ascending the steps, to take his place as outside passenger on the same con-, veyance. The coincidence seemed remarkable; but might he not be: a traveller going to some place in the vicinity of the coach-route which conveyed the sorrowful party. She felt anxious, not being able to account for the misgivings which were stealing over her mind. Whoever he might be, he was very much of an invalid, or anxious to remain incognito. The night of the second day's travel brought them to the quiet village, whei'e, at the farthest extremity, stood the church and parsonage. It was too dark on their arrival to tell what were its pre- tensions to rural beauty. 'All the light they had to guide them up the little pebbled walk, was what issued from the coachman's lamp, while the guard was delivering the luggage entrusted to his care; and there might be seen the same muffled object, bringing out the portly figure of his companion, attired in his scarlet coat, with a face almost as ruddy as the emblem of his calling. They were welcomed with a quiet dignity that bespoke the gentleman; he apologized for his seeming inat- tention in not meeting and accompanying them from the last station. , They had preceded his ex- pectations by one week'; he hoped they would re-   MARIAN WALLACE.        129 ceive his apology, and make themselves entirely at home. His wife had just retired with the chil- dren, but would join them in a few minutes. While waiting for the entrance of his wife, we will en- deavor to describe Mr. Barlow, as they first beheld him. He was what might be termed a handsome man;--not beauty of features; it was the light of intellect that beamed from his deep hazel eye, which illumined his face, and- lent a beauty of no ordinary character. He was well proportioned, and his manner bespoke him a gentleman accustomed to refined society. With a deep, earnest piety, he had sought and obtained orders in the Established Church of England, as curate, subsisting on the small pittance of thirty pounds a year, doing the entire duty belonging to his charge, occasionally relieved by the rector; once annually, by the bishop of the diocese, who received almost as many thou- sands as the poor curate did pounds. He had in former years enjoyed the luxury of wealth, and would still, but for one of those unforeseen calam- ities to which the island of St. Domingo is sub- ject, which sweep whole plantations away in a single night. After such an occurrence as this, he collected the remnant of his shattered fortune, and, with his widowed mother, sought England's peace- ful shore. There, in simple retirement, their days 6'  ,    130     :ARIAN  WALLACE. were spent in the advancement of Christ's Iing- dom on the earth, and here did the happy spirit of his mother ascend to the God who gave it. From among his parishioners he selected a partner to share his joys and sorrows, one in every way calculated to be a fit helpmate to this man of God. Two children blessed their union. Such was the family with whom Flora was now to associate. She who would have been fitted by family, position, and education to adorn the higher walks of life, had not sin hurled her from her ele- vated position. But the arm of mercy was out- stretched, pointing to the home of this truly pious family; where the stricken wanderer might find a place of rest. It was thought best by Miss Woolsey and Carle- ton, that Flora should rest from the fatigue of her journey, ere she was called to part from her chil- dren, as they dreaded the effect it would have on her in her languid state. Fearfully was she reap- ing her reward. Flora was unable to leave her bed for many days after her arrival. Mr. Barlow was a pleasant and agreeable com- panion; his mind was well stored with useful knowl- edge, and the fervor of his piety diffused its peace- ful glow around his domestic hearth, though the small remuneration which he received as the re- I    MARIAN  WALLACE.      131 ward of his arduous labors barely kept him from starvation. When will the sons of England awake to the in- vestigation-when will they assert their right, to have an equal distribution of money to those poor, pious laboring men employed in the vineyard of the Lord, turning many' from the error of their ways? Would that the government of that free and enlightened land would award to every one according to his labor in the propagation of the gospel Would it not be well if some of the funds of those mitred bishops were extended to the sup- port- of the subordinate preachers, on whom all the duty devolves? Of churse; it is necessary that every position should sustain itself, and it is well known that the wants of a village curate are small in comparison to thse of a mitred bishop ; but is that a just reason why their wants should not be supplied? Is that a just reason why the wives of those poor clergymen should do all the drudgery of their families, though fitted by education to take their position among the honorable of the land? Ought they to be excluded from society congenial to their taste in consequence of poverty? It can never be written on the 'brow of the poor curate of the Established Church, that he had entered the church for the sake of emolument; he must look   132,     MAREIAN WALLACE. beyond, for the recompense of reward, in that bet- ter land to which all his labors tend. While waiting the convalesence of Flora, dis- patches reached them in their quiet retreat, urging their return, owing to the precarious state of Mr. Leslie's health. It became, therefore, necessary to hasten the long-dreaded separation, and, as it were, to wrest the children from the grasp of their weak and suffering mother. But when she became aware of the cause from which arose the extreme urgency of the case, then, and not till then, did this fallen creature realize the full extent of her wretched sit- uation.  Let us draw a veil over partings such as these, thankful it is but seldom that women forget their proper sphere, and make partings such as this ne- cessary. Leaving her in the hands of the Alhighty Power who directs the issues of life, the travellers turned their faces homeward. Miss Woolsey longed to clasp her fondly loved Marian to her bosom. Emma and Caroline were attracted by the novelty of the surrounding objects which met their gaze. a         1   MARIAN  WALLACE.        133 Thinks not of other air, Dreams not of alien skies; ie seeks but to depart From the land he loves too well, From thoughts that smite his heart. So England! long farewell, farewell!" BARRY CORNWALL. ON her arrival at Eglantine Cottage with her charge, where she expected to rest until the fol- lowing  morning, when she would drive over to Shirly Park, where she would be looked for, a letter was put into Miss Woolseys hands, which changed her arrangements, as it required her im- ediate  presence    that of thae  children, at Shirly Park. .Mr. Lesl  ad passed a very restless day, having asked evelyl      iutes, if she had not arrived yet?  She immediately resumed her journey to Shirly Park; but it was midnight when she arrived with her sleeping charge.   Disrobing them of their outer garments, she committed them - to the care of an attendant, and ascended to the   134     MARIAN' WALLACE. room which Mr. Leslie occupied. There sat Mrs. Leslie, in the identical spot where she had parted witlh her many months before; to appearance she had never moved from that position. The same majesty of feature, the same haughty curve of the neck, the same pale countenance, met her gaze as she entered.. She extended her hand; it was as cold as the Parian statue whose classic beauty adorned her boudoir. Mr. Leslie did not seem to be aware of Miss Woolsey's entrance, for he turned restlessly to his wife, and asked if they had not come yet. Mrs. Leslie bent down, and kissed the palid cheek of the suffeere; at the same time, she spoke sweetly the answer to the invalid. She beckoned Miss Woolsey to approach; she did so,-but what a change! The sunken eye, the hollow cheek, the thin lip, through which the breath was scarcely perceptible; all told that the strong man haid be- come feeble as a child. Stretching out his emaci- ated hand,he welcomed her by a feeble pressure, which Miss Woolsey returned, and carried his hand reverently to her lips. Tears of sympathy fell on that trembling hand. He thanked her by a look, and in the feeblest accents inquired if all his wishes had been attended to. "Why did you not bliing the children with you," said Mr. Leslie, "that I might embrace them, ere I go hence?5'    : 9 l   MARIAN WALLACE.       135 "They are here in the house, but their infant nature could not refrain from slumber. They are sweetly sleeping in each other's arms. Not know- ing your anxiety to see them, I gave them in charge of an attendant, and made my way up here." "Right, right! I forgot the rest their childish years demanded; but, Amy, I must see them this night. Cannot you have them brought to my bed- side, that I may look upon them2" "My dear husband," said Mrs. Leslie, "do re- strain your impatience until the morning. I fear the consequences, in your restless and excited state." "Amy, dear, urge me not to postpone this in- terview. I know, dear, the motive which prompts you. My dear wife, the sands of life are running down quicker than you anticipate; soon the voice which makes the request will be hushed in death. I know you cannot realize the truth, but it is even so." Miss Woolsey turned from the bed that she might have them brought; but Mr. Leslie begged her to remain. His wife, knowing how many things he wa;ted to say, and how gratifying it would be to him, retired herself, to conduct them into the pres- ence of their grandparent. Long and earnest was the conversation that en- sued during the absence of Mrs. Leslie. The in-   186    i MARIAN  WALLACE. valid seemed perfectly satisfied with all the ar- rangements entered into, for the comfort of his erring child. "Poor stricken one," said he, "would that I could take you with me to that world whither my spirit is wending; there wouldst thou be free from mortal care, there would thy purified spirit bask in the smiles of the glorified Redeemer, who gave his life a ransom for sinners such as thee. Oh my child, could I but know that thy ransomed spirit will be permitted to enter that bright world, what would contumely and suffering be, for the short space of thy sojourn in this unfriendly world  My dear Miss Woolsey, do you think my child is penitent? Do you think she realizes the heinbus- ness of the sin she has committed against! high heaven? What is the blighting of our earthly hopes in comparison with the expulsion of my child from the joys of a believer, whose robes have been washed in the Redeemer's blood, and made fit to be par- takers with him of that celestial kingdom?" Miss Woolsey detailed all the conversation she had had with Flora on that subject: It seemed to soothe the dying parent; he was willing to rest the bruised reed in the hands of his Heavenly Father, who had promised not to quench the smok- ing flax, but raise it to a flame. While engaged in this earnest and profitable conversation, ,Ms. d   MARIAN WALLACE.       137 Leslie entered, leading the twin children of her disgraced daughter. It was truly affecting, and worthy. of commendation, to see how much her love for her husband, and desire to fulfil his wishes, and to smoothe his dying pillow, had enabled her to overcome her insatiate pride sufficiently to conform to what was so repugnant to her haughty self-love. Well would it have been had the lesson been last- ing, that' self, and all its inordinate gratifications, might have become a secondary consideration. How much sorrow would she have been the means of alleviating, how much misery might she have prevented. But her heart was yet unprepared for the sowing of the good seed. The poor little girls appeared frightened, brought thus suddenly into the presence of the bed of death, on which lay one so nearly allied to them. 'They stood there in the presence of the power of the mighty conqueror, who had laid his icy hand on a noble heart, whose clay tenement was about to yield to his all-conquering' sway. r. Leshe was deeply affected by the sight of these children, as, hand in hand, they stood by his bed, unable to comprehend the solemnity of the scene, and the reason for their being aroused from their slumbers. As they stood there, the father was unable to trace any resemblance to his daughter, they being living   138     MARIAN WALLACE. images of their father. Mr. Leshe was disappointed when he discovered this. "Must they resemble," said he, "'that cruel, wicked man?"Nevertheless it did not prevent him from fplding them to his bosom, and committing them to the care of his wife. "My dear, dear love," said he, addressing Mrs s Leslie, "be a parent to these helpless chil- dren, who must ever blush for their mother's dis- grace. Should they remain under your protection, keep them uncontaminated from the ways of the world; instruct them, or have them instructed, in the way they should go, that when they are old they may not depart from it, And now let me rest. I think I can rest; buit do not leave me, my beloved wife, nor you, my kind friend. I know it is selfish in me to wish your presence, knowing how fatigued you must be, but bear with me; our interviews on earth must be few, and I wish you to be with :me when my last struggle comes." Miss Woolsey pressed his hand in acquiesence of his wishes; he understood and thanked her. "'If Frank," added Mr. Leslie, "only arrive in time, that I may bless my noble boy, every earthly wish will have been fulfilled. And now, my dear friend, read me that passage, 'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me, thy rod, and thy staff, they -    comfort me?' Blessed support, as the swellings of Jordan bathe my feet. My Saviour has promised to be with me, why then should I be afraid?" From the time of his heavy family affliction, Mr. Leshe had rested his all in the hands of his Hea- venly Father; and now, as the hour of nature's trial arrived, lie felt secure in Him in whom he had plt his trust. He lingered longer than was anticipated by his physicians. Miiss Woolsey remained at Shirly Park until the remains of Mr. Leshe had been conveyed to the family tomb. She then bade the widow a sorrow- ful adieu, and returned to her own cottage with Marian, who had remained at Shirly Park during her absence. What a relief, to that young girl's mind was the quiet of her own sweet home. Mrs. Leshe had found her very useful, and, consequently, became exacting in the fulfilment of such duties as she had taken voluntarily upon herself; this suited ill with the temper and disposition of Marian, accustomed to be spoken to in the most loving and gentle manner. The haughty commands of 1Mrs. Leslie brought a retort to her lips, which, though unbreatled was yet the feeling of her heart. She was too much a child of nature to be able to control her countenance, which was a sure index of her heart. Poor Marian! the trials of   "O     MARfAN  WALLACE. her life are but just beginning; her path would be strewn with many thorns.  Mrs. Leslie found Miss Woolsey a valuable and useful friend, in whose society she spent much of her time during her year of mourning.  Marian was ever a kind and affectionate playfellow for Emma and Caroline, who had not been able to in- gratiate themselves in the good graces of their grandmother. There was one thing at this time Miss Woolsey could not account for; it was the unevenness of Marian's temper; she seemed ever ready to burstf into the most uncontrolled fit of passion for the most trivial reason. She had re- monstrated frequently with her on the impropriety of her conduct; all her answer was: "Let me re- turn home, I cannot endure being here." "Now, Marian, is not this childish and foolish, and are you. not with me? Do I not shield you; as much here as I possibly could at home? though I gladly would return; but as long as I can be useful to lMrs. Leslie I consider it my- duty to re- main; and what excuse could I offer for your wish to return without. me? you know you will soon have to resume your studies, ,and then, my dear girl, you will be relieved from the bondage you consider a visit here to be; wait patiently till then, my love, and you will enjoy the comforts of home       .   MARIAN WALLACE..       141 much more by complying with my wishes. Now go and seek the children. I need not tell you to be kind to them, your own heart prompts the feel- ing-poor children away from their parents." It grieved Miss Woolsey to have to speak re- provingly to Marian, but she could not indulge what she considered only a whim. There was not a wish that dear child uttered that she would not willingly have granted,. could she by so doing, know that she was adding to her happiness. Marian went, not to seek the children, but to weep in silence, and when she again entered the presence of her l' aunty," she looked so dejected that Miss Woolsey reproached herself for her severity in chiding Marian, when she might have soothed the waywardness of her disposition-the dear pre- cious orphan, who had no one to love her; she really would feel glad when she could consistently return to her own cottage, and she certainly would make one more effort to that effect, without assign- ing Marian's unhappiness as the reason? Miss Woolsey did not know how much the young girl's patience had been tried during her absence, and on every occasion when her presence did not shield her, been made to endure the haughty and unkind conduct of Mrs. Leslie, who seemed to take particular pains to mortify and humble her, though   "2     MARIAN  WALLACE. she could ]lave been immediately relieved of her presence. Marian forbore to complain, hoping, as  her "amnty" said, it would be of short duration. The death of Mr. Leslie left his wife wealthy, independent of what became hers at the death of her mother, She might be considered one of the wealthiest untitled widows in Europe; if from that she could derive any happiness. Does wealth bring happiness No; would she not have given all that wealth to hlave her family's name untarnished, that she could lift her lofty brow witlhout quailing before her fellows? Yes, much as she' loved wealth, she- loved an untarnished name better. . Bitter were the feelings against her who had tarnished the shield of her family. She would have been willing almost to have hurled her with her own hands to destruc- tioli, rather than endure the humiliation she was called daily to, submit too. Haughty, haughty, mother! with no tlought of that God against whom you and she have both sinned. No player ascends to that throne of grace that He would vouchsafe to pardon ,her manifold transgressions. Wrapt in a mantle of your own righteousness, you think not of the sinning Magdalen. Miss Bankhead was very much surprised to hear  at the end of her year of mourning, that her ser- vices were no longer required. That lady had hailed   M AR IAN WALLACE.       143 the arrival of the twins with a degree of satisfac- tion, known only to lone who has retained a lucra- tive situation for many years; and sees the proba- bility of losing it-and when an unforeseen circum- stance transpires, which makes probable its con- tinuan ce for many years yet to come,-the youth of the children making that event possible. Mrs. Leshe was determined to rid herself of the lady's presence, knowing her to be the indirect agent of all her misery.  Iad she fulfilled the charge committed to her care, with fidelity, she would have taken pleasure in her society, and of- fered her a home for the remainder of her life. Mrs. Leslie must act cautiously in this matter, not to arouse the lion in his lair; she has heard more than was ever intended for her ear, so there must be a sort of compromise with the lady. We will leave them .to arrange matters to the entire satisfaction of the persons concerned, and see how prosper the inmates of Eglantine Cottage. Miss Woolsey and Marian are seated at their work-table, enjoying each other's society. The lit- tle laughing child is no longer the bright, sunny plaything, but a young maiden of fifteen, without any pretensions to beauty; nothing remains of rosy infancy by which she can be recognized', but the dark, shining curls; there they are, as dark and   "4     MARIAN  WALLACE. glossy as when she played hide-and-seek, after her own peculiar fashion. She can shake them as dis- dainfully now as then, one can see by the toss of that head now bent uponl her work, which was raised but an instant before, listening to what her companion had to say. "Aunty, it is useless to expostulate with me-is she not perfectly unendurable?" "Iush! Marian; were I to admit what you say as right, probably in after years, when your judg- inent is more matured, you, Marian, might reflect on me, for influencing you in an erroneous decision. I cannot say that Mrs. Leslie's conduct towards you is generous, but do you not sometimes provoke her by setting at naught her authority?" "And what right has she to lord it over me, I should like to know? Has she ever in her life given one farthing for my support? Hlad it I?een left to her generosity, might I not have starved?" "Marian, Marian! talk not so. Is she not the daughter of our, beloved Mrs. Mortimer? but for whose kindness I should have been unable to have provided you with so pleasant a home, where all your wants might be gratified. You have never known a wish unfulfilled." "Aunty, I know all this, and am really grateful s to you, for all you have done for me. Do forgive   MARIAN WALLACE.       145 me, I cannot keep my temper, and my patience be- comes entirely exhausted, with her continual lord- ing and commanding; that I might be enabled to endure, but When she taunts me with Frank, I can- not perfectly understand what she means. Aunty, is it wrong for me to love Frank?- he tells me every day how much he' thinks of me., I certainly do not love him as much as he professes to do me, and when I told Mrs. Leslie so, she called me im- pertinent, and ordered me from her presence. I rather think the next time I enter her presence, tle sight of me will be beneficial to her ladyship." Miss Woolsey was sad; she knew how much those children were attached; they were every thing to each other, and she could not but think j- it was very injudicious in Mrs. Leslie to make any remarks in their presence, to cause them to analyze what amount of love they possessed for each other. She was, however, determined that Marian should not be subjected to such annoyances for the future. Shirly Park was not her home. Perhaps she had been wrong to allow her to visit there so frequently, when the dear girl objected so much to those visits. "Should she be rendered unhappy by any inadver- tency on my part," thought Miss Woolsey, "I never should forgive myself. Is she not dearer to me than anly thing on this earth 2' 7   "6     MARIAN  WALLACE. But Marian was not always unhappy during those periodical visits. With Frank and his uncle, theree i was a tacit understanding, to make the most of the  time allotted for her stay, and afford her all the 1 enjoyment in their power. Marian saw and ap- p  i precated this, and thanked them with a grateful heart for the pleasure she had enjoyed. And though  many, many years have passed, and with them their accumulated trials, yet not one act of kindness then i bestowed, has ever been erased from her memory. Could she refrain from resenting insults when of- fered, comparatively speaking her life would have been a happy one. Being a creature of impulse,  an insult was no sooner offered than resented; but with the sairie impulse was she ready to forgive and acknowledge error: she was candid and up-  right, unconscious of fear, when contending for  right, whoever the opponents might be. It was,  probably, owing to this that she enjoyed so much i of Mrs. Leslie's ill will, who detested seeing this i: fearlessness in one whom she wished to crush into ' nothingness; and although every dday Marian had  the example of Christian patience in the deport- v ment of her beloved aunty, who endeavored to   A walk in the footsteps of Him who, when he was  reviled, reviled not again; it failed of its effect,  and Miss Woolsey had to mourn the same faults  j  .:   in youth which she discovered in her childhood; but, had she not cast her "bread upon the waters 2" and the promise was, that it should be found, not in a few, but '"after many days." She was will- ing to wait the Lord's appointed time. If Mrs. Leslie did not intend to do Marian jus- tice at some future time, why did she assume such a dictatorial manner towards her, why interfere in the prescribed plan laid down for her education why presume to control her in the selection of her companions, and insist that those not agreeable to herself must be immediately given up? Marian had many dear and loved ones, among her school associates, every way worthy of her affection, on whom she bestowed the love of a warm heart, and :by whom it was returned with equal ardor. There are those who sneeringly object to the fervency of affection found in youth; but why should there not be holy, pure, and lasting attachments formed at that season of life, which may defy the treacherous storns of after life to eradicate? have not some clung with greater tenacity to the friends of their youth, as they perceived the hollowness of th6 world's worshipping followers? Give me a heart that will bound at the mere mention of the name )f one who had shared in childish sports, and, lis- tened to the recital of their childish sorrows, be   they separated by the wide Atlantic or Pacific, in  whatever clime of this habitable world; and gladly would I hail such as kindred spirits, yet untram- melled by the false allurements of this world. Now, when I speak of the loved ones Qf youth, I mean not the dross that passes current among us at the present day, such as the boarding-school sentimental  attachment of our young misses, who interchange i letters of endearment, one of which is, probably,  freighted with more love than any one could pos- .  sibly feel.                   i Merrily did the voice of Frank sound, as he de- i dared his intention of bearing Marian away as his ' company for the remainder of the day. She pro- i tested against the possibility of complying with his  wishes, as she had an engagement.        i "But Marian, dear Emma is confined to her room,  and grandmamma says she expects you without   i fail."                      ' "Well, Frank, your grandmamma will be disap-  pointed for once. I have not the most distant idea  of complying with her wishes, even if an engage-  ment did not prerent. Her wishes are always de- )i livered as arbitrary commands, to which I am not  in duty bound to submit."  "Marian, do not offend my grandmamma, by,*  i setting at naught wishes or commands--whichever :J    you may be pleased to call them-for by so doing, consider the penalty which must be inflicted on me--the loss of your society. I should probably be restricted from coming here. My grandmamma is so changed since the death of grandpapa, that some-  times the sinful wish arises: 'Oh that he would return; but he will never gladden my sight on earth!' "Frank, you are speaking of being restricted from coming here. Would it not be well to ac- custom ourselves to look calmly forward to the time when we must necessarily be separated. That time must inevitably come. I am well aware I occupy a doubtful position by the death of Mrs. Mfortimer. I have been excluded fromn mixing freely among those she considered her friends. I do regret that, by the arbitrary commands of Mrs. Leslie, I am debarred the privilege of associating with those my dear aunty considers not deroga- tory to the adopted child of Mrs. Mortimer. What motive she can have for making an isolated being of me, I shall leave for her good judgment to give a satisfactory reason; for what the sanction of my more than mother permits, Mrs. Leslie must cer- tainly understand that her imperious commands will be but abortive." "Now, Marian, that's a good girl; do not look     , --   -        L    150     MARIAN WALLACE. so ruffled, but tell me what I shall say to my grand- mamma."  "Why, I have told you I shan't go." "Don't say shan't." "Well, say wont, if that will suit you better." "I will say neither the one nor the other, but go and find Miss Woolsey." "Now, Frank, as you value my love and happi- ness, seek not my aunty in order that she may in- fluence me; leave me the right to decide from which visit I anticipate the most pleasure." Frank was wounded. Judging from his own feel- ings, he had anticipated the pleasure Marian would experience in a day spent with himself, without any restraint but his sisters, as he knew his grandmam- ma was engaged with Carleton, and left orders she would not be disengaged, to visitors, for that day. Marian did not know how deeply she had wound- ed that noble boy, whom she loved with a' pure and sisterly affection; and the persons upon whom she could lavish the wealth of her affection were too few, to permit any unkindness of manner to alienate. Miss Woolsey seeing the agitated countenances before her, started, fearing that Marian had been imprudent enough to disclose any part of the lesson she had received from Mrs. Leslie, relative to the   4I     MARIAN WALLACE.       151 i :1  young lad, whose countenance bore the expression of one whose feelings had been deeply wounded. "How is this, my children? you do not seem as happy in each other's society as formerly." Frank remained silent, and Marian explained the purport of his visit, and the answer she wished him to deliver to Mrs. Leslie. "Well, Marian, upon the whole, do you not think that it would be best to send a regret to this much- anticipated visit? It will teach you a useful and salutary lesson, a lesson which you may be fie- W  qlquently called upon to perform-that of yielding your pleasure to the will of another." "Aunty, is it your wish, that I send a regret?" "No, it is not' my wish that this regret should --  be sent; it is simply my advice, as the thing best to be done in the present case." "Your wishes must ever be the law by which -:  "my conduct will be regulated. I will, therefore, do as you advise, and excuse myself from what : would have afforded me unspeakable pleasure. I relinquish it, however, upon one condition, that I remain at home, and that you, my dear aunty, do not urge me to accompany Frank to Shirly Park." "' No, Marian, you may depend upon it, I shall not urge you against your inclination, though I should have preferred your doing so."' '-k   152     MARiAN WALLACE. "And why should you have preferred my doing so?" ' "Simply, by so doing self-gratification would have been a secondary consideration.' "Aunty, do you think me selfish because I will not meekly submit to the caprices of an arrogant woman, who, from my earliest infancy, has thwarted me in every gratification within her reach?" "Marian, how I long to see that rebellious tem- per under the power of Him who hath taught us, 'that when we are smitten on the one cheek, we. should turn the other also.' And now, my dear girl, chase the lowering from your brow, tnd tell me how you intend enjoying yourself while I re- turn with Frank, to see Emma. I very much fear she is too delicate a flower to bloom in this uncon- genial soil. The transparency of her complexion is but the precursor of that insidious disease by which our own land yields so many of the young and lovely to the bosom of their mother earth." a   MAR1IAN  WALLACE.       T53 ! ' CHAPTER   X. "Great God I we thank thee for this home, This bounteous birthland of the free; Where wanderers from afar may colie And breathe the air of liberty. Still may her flowers untrampled spring, Her harvests wave, her cities rise; And yet, till time shall fold his wing, Remain Earth's loveliest Paradise." WILLIAM JEWETT PABEDIE.  Miss WOOLSEY found Emma more indisposed than she had even expected. It was some time after her arrival ere she gained an interview with Mrs. Leslie who assumed more haughtiness of manner towards ji  her than she had ever done since the death of Mrs. Mortimer. Speaking of Marian's non-compliance with her wishes, when she had taken the trouble to send her grandson to accompany her, she said angrily: "Then, Miss Woolsey, it was your duty to see my wishes were attended to, independent of the mere whim    of the girl, to visit where I have re- peatedly expressed my desire she should not. Are 7*   154     MARIAN  WALLACE. you insensible of the necessity of excluding her from the plebeian herd if I permit her to associatea with my grandchildren." "If to associate with your grandchildren, she must become a mere cypher in the world, it is an elevation I have no ambition for her to obtain. When I received your departed husband's sanction to my wishes-that of retaining her as my own-I never, for a moment, comprehended the necessity for ny interference in the manner I thought most pr er to regulate and control the members of my Imily. You have frequently encroached on the friendship I entertained for you, and my affection for your deceased mother. I have submitted with- out a murmur, until the happiness of the dearest object I have on earth is concerned, ere I venture to remonstrate with you on the impropriety of any such interference." "AWhy, Miss Woolsey! have I really ruffled the hitherto placid temper of my very amiable friend?" "Mrs. 'Leslie, if you mean that remark as an incentive for me to exhibit an unbecoming spirit, then it is futile; I will not be urged into any demon- stration inconsistent with the character I profess. Christians may suffer deeply from wrongs sus- tained; but must they, because professing to follow in the footsteps of Him who was meek and lowly,   I::        r MAlARIAN WALLACE.     155 refrain from vindicating the cause of the weaker party? No! Had you accused me personally of any supposed neglect, or fault, I should have turned a deaf ear to the accusation; but I cannot so easily keep silence when you charge Marian with want of respect, when you have treated her in a manner your own heart must reproach you for. How can you expect to find respect and love where your own conduct warrants hatred and contempt? Ma- rian is but human-her leart is yet unregenerated." "Really, Miss Woolsey, I did not intend you should read me a lecture for the disobedience of that saucebox, whom no one cares particularly, whether' she ever becomes any thing or not; only my mother's memory might be tarnished, if she were permitted to mix freely with persons one does not know any thing about. I really think I have been very con- descending to allow her free access to Shirly Park." "Mrs. Leslie, you mistake Marian, if you think she would be flattered by the condescension. She is a proud girl, and nothing will be able to induce her to compromise her dignity. Soon will she be called upon to take part in the busy scenes of life. In a few short years at most, must she assume the position for which an all-wise Providence has as- signed her. May she be fitted to enter upon the stern realities of life, with a firm, unshaken trust   156     MARIAN  WALLACE. in Him who hath declared, 'the very hairs of our heads are all numbered;' May His precept be a lamp to her feet, and a light to her path, what- ever station of life she may occupy. May she adorn it, is the sincere desire of my heart; and my fervent prayer to the throne of grace-that He will vouchsafe to her such wisdom, as will enable her to choose that better part which cannot be taken away." "Do you not think you have an opinion entirely too exalted of Marian's worth?" "I certainly did not speak of her as possessing qualities praiseworthy, though my affection for her might so influence me, as to make me unfit to de- tect any error in one who I know possesses a loving heart, free from dissimulation, and, if rightly direct- ed, will make a noble woman. Hers is a charac- ter ill calculated to make friends; but those she may be so fortunate as to interest, will find she possesses many sterling virtues." Mrs. Leslie felt chagrined; she knew these re- marks were intended as a reproach for the manner in which she had ever treated Marian. She was, how- ever, determined not to be deterred from bending the haughty girl, and making her subservient to her will. "I hope," said she to Miss Woolsey, "you do not intend encouraging a spirit of disobedience,   I:      MARIAN  WALLACE.       157 and giving ideas of perfect equality, to one, who, of course, must understand she was not born to en- joy all the, privileges of wealth and station." "Were I to implant such feelings in her young mind," said Miss Woolsey, "I should be very cul- pable. It would be sowing the seeds of future wretchedness. No! Mrs. Leslie, there is no one who appreciates the conventional rules of society more than I do. Has not our blessed Lord taught us, 'to render unto Coesar the things which are Caesar's?' If you will give me any just reason for Marian sub- mitting to your authority, I will most cheerfully submit to your prior claim." "Heaven defend me from the priority of such a A *claim! I have long washed my hands clear of any claim the girl may ever suppose she has on me." "Fear not, Mrs. Leslie, that Marian will ever pre- sume to encroach upon the daughter of Mrs. Mor- timer. She is perfectly happy, knowing herself to be sheltered by the feeble arms of one who con- siders her a precious trust committed to her care, and for whose happiness she will have to render an account at the great tribunal, where you and I must appear, to receive the reward for the deeds done in the body. I came, Mrs. Leslie, to see your weak and suffering grandchild, not to contend with the daughter of my friend and benefactress, who,   158     MARIAN  WALLACE. were she permitted to look from her heavenly home, and take cognizance of the motives and actions of those who shared her love on earth, would cast an approving glance towards that little spot where the child of her adoption is sheltered from the treachery of the world, and taught to walk in the command- ments of Him, around whose throne stand the in- numerable throng who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb." "Well, Miss Woolsey, I have no desire that the friendship which has existed so many years, should be dissolved by any thing so trivial. How did you find Emma? I have been so particularly engaged this morning, that I have not had time to look in upon the little sufferer." ' "I found her suffering from extreme debility, her cough having been exceedingly troublesome during the night, \and deprived her of the repose so necessary to one in her feeble state." "Do you know I have been thinking of sending- her to try the waters at Cheltenham? perhaps the change might be beneficial to her. She is a strange child." "She is thoughtful, Mrs. Leslie, much beyond her years." "I know it, and it was simply to gratify her this morning, that I desired the presence of Marian   MARIAN  WALLACE.      159 at the Park; and now, to convince me you really forgive me, do permit your beloved Marian to join you at dinner." This, though said in Mrs. Leslie's blandest man- ner, lost its influence on Miss Woolsey, who re- plied: "I am sorry to give a negative, to your  polite invitation, having pledged myself to Marian that she should not be obliged by me, to present herself at Shirly Park. At any other time Mrs. Leslie may honor Marian with an invitation, I, in her name, will tender her most humble regard, in acceptance of the same, when it does not succeed a prior engagement, in which case I shall consider her in duty bound to send a regret; and the polite- ness of 'Mrs. Leslie guarantees said lady's acceptance of the same." Mrs. Leslie bit her lips with suppressed rage. The cool and polite manner in which Miss Wool- sey had set her at defiance, enraged her beyond ex- pression. "I shall bend the stubborn pride of that I haughty girl," said she;" she shall quail before the eye of one whom she has made to.. feel humbled before an inferior." Marian was rejoiced to see her aunty return so much sooner than she had any reason to expect,   160     MARIAN  WALLACE. had been agitated on her account. She kissed the cheek of her more than mother, and expressed a fear that she was suffering from indisposition, from which her aunty hastened to relieve the anxious girl, declaring herself perfectly well, "Now, tell me, my love, how you've enjoyed yourself during my absence? I am sorry there should have been any necessity for depriving you of your anticipated pleasure. Mrs. Leslie and I have talked the matter over, and I think there will be no recurrence of the like again." "Well, really, aunty, I am very glad, it makes me so unhappy when I yield to my temper. I say and do many things which, in a few moments, I regret exceedingly; for instance, my speaking so unkindly to Frank. I wouldn't hurt his feelings for the world. And if Mrs. Leslie would only not be so dictatorial to me, I would endeavor, to over- come my prejudices." "I am really glad, Marian, tlat you realize your faults, and trust you will endeavor to overcome theni. Take them to the throne of grace, lay them before the Lord, ask of Him strength to enable you to overcome the evil tendency of your nature. He has assured us, if we ask we shall receive; then ask, my dear girl, in' the sincerity of your heart, that your joy may be full. And when Mrs. Leslie   -        MnMARIAN WALLACE.      161 sends again for you to go to Shirly Park, endeavor to obey as pleasantly and affectionately as pos- sible." Poor Marian! her obedience is about to be tried much sooner than she anticipated. Autumn, with its golden hues, is stripping the foliage of its emerald green, and dotting it here and there with gorgeous colors. Marian is gazing upon the lofty mountains by which her home is sur- rounded; the beauty of the landscape delights her young and imaginative mind; the breeze from the lagoon fans her glowing cheek; her mind is enkin- died with enthusiastic love and admiration. She longs for the foot of an antelope, that she might ascend to the top of those lofty mountains, and look down upon the world below. She was startled from her reverie by the entrance of one of her companions, a volatile young crea- ture, exclaiming, "What are yolldreaming about, Marian?  Do you kinow our dancing season com- mences with a .grand fancy ball? We shall be ladies and gentlemen in miniature, and our mam- mas, guardians and friends are all to be invited, and, only think, the Assembly Rooms of the Ex- change are to be thrown open for the occasion I Oh Marian! how I wish I was as graceful a dancer as you; would I not show my power to step one, two,   162     MARIAN WALLACE. three! Never mind; depend upon it, I shall dance to the best of my ability-I am said to keep better time than you. Now, what will you wear? I in- tend to wear pink. Mamma thinks it is more be- coming than any thing else; but, I suppose you'll wear that everlasting white. Brother Charles says  your aunty intends making a vestal virgin of you."  Marian was truly delighted with the intelligence; her vanity would be gratified, for if there was any thing she excelled in, it was the art of dancing. Young as she was, she was not unconscious of the praise which had been frequently awarded by visit- ors, while performing her lesson. But the opportu- nity of exhibiting before so large an assemblage as would undoubtedly be there, her sanguine mind had not anticipated, until arrived at a suitable age.  Nothing was talked of but the all-important event, and what should be worn. Marian was very anx- ious to dress in character, but that Miss Woolsey so decidedly objected; to that Marian yielded, and  the everlasting white was decided to be the most suitable. It may be doubted whether Marian's slumbers were sound for many nights before the day that would usher in the important event. Be that as it may, it at length arrived, and with it an invitation to Shirly Park. Poor Marian! this will test the strength of her integrity. Long and ,')   MARIAN WALLACE.       163 bitter was the struggle. None knew how much she suffereo in relinquishing her gratification to the will of another. She resigned it, however, without any visible demonstration. Miss Woolsey's coun- tenance spoke unutterable things, when Marian de- clared her readiness to accompany the messenger. She longed to press her to her heart, and express how much satisfaction her conduct gave her, but feared it might have a pernicious effect. The arrival of Marian at Shirly Park; was hailed by Mrs. Leslie with unfeigned pleasure; it would give her an opportunity of impressing what she considered a very salutary lesson of her own su- periority over the mind of this haughty and dis- obedient girl. "Well, Miss Consequence, have you really hon- ored us with your august presence? I suppose you intend acting the tragic queen, and we your hum- ble subjects." "Mrs. Leslie," said Marian, "I came here by your express invitation. Had I been aware you only sent for -me, that you might have an opportunity of insulting me, I assure you, you would never have had it." "How dare you presume to talk to one, on whom you are dependent for your daily bread?" "Were I a dependent on you, I solemnly assure ,  '  tr   164     MARIAN WALLACE. you, no power on earth would keep me a dependent on your bounty."  "Then, let me inform you, my haughty dame, that you are supported from a portion of my estate, and, that at the death of Miss Woolsey, it reverts to me again, and will be by me retained; nor will one farthing of it ever yield you a loaf of bread, to keep you from starvation." "Enough, madam  While I have my health and  my hands, I think I can keep myself from starva- tion; but were I in such a situation, you might refrain from any fears of my ever applying to you.  Farewell, mnadam!" With a burning cheek and a flashing eye, Marian departed from Shirly Park, never to enter within  its walls again.  In one short week, Marian, with her little all, was i borne on the waves of the mighty ocean, to seek a home where the oppressed of every nation may  ; find shelter. O Columbia! are not the wings of  thy freedom outstretched to receive the oppressed I of every land under thy fostering care? Yes! As  a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, so dost  thou shield the sons and daughters of thy adoption. Many a child, driven from his parents' hearth,  has sought thy shores, and received his just re-  ward of merit, denied him vhere it was his  x    MARIAN WALLACE.        165 right to receive it. Here he enjoys the long-sought emulation under the blessed liberty which makes thee mighty among the nations. Long may the banner of thy freedom be unfurled-to woo the op- pressed to thy shores, and as thou offerest the rights and privileges of free-born citizens to thy adopted children, may they never turn their backs upon thee, and wound the hand which had been outstretched to save them. But when the fire of enthusiasm glows within their bosoms, fear not, O Columbia, if a little green spot be watered with the dews of love, for the land of their birth; and fearful should I be of the being who has no little green spot hid away in his heart of hearts--that his profes- sions of attachment for the laws and institutions of his adopted country, are but a subterfuge to hide the hollowness of the heart which vociferates its praise. To the shores of this favored land Marian's thoughts tended, when the home which sheltered her infant years became insupportable. No induce- ment could deter that passionate girl from accom- plishing her object-that of leaving her native land, forsaking the arm which had been outstretched for her support. What is more sorrowful than to see a young female commencing the journey of life alone,-alone to endure its toils, alone to brave   166     MARIAN WALLACE. its dangers? How, amid the changes of life, will she look back to that hour of voluntary scparatioln, when every step may be one of sorrow? Marian is quitting scenes where she was a stranger to toil,  without funds necessary to, enable her to live /- dependent. She must labor for her daily bl ad. Ias she weighed the cost? 'Will the indifference  of a haughty spirit sustain her alone, without pro-  vision, without protection, without one to direct? Oh may, the ears of her understanding be unstopped, i that she may hear the heavenly voice, "This is the Il way, walk ye in it." And when the fear of want as-  sails her, may she be enabled to put her trust in the Lord and do good, that she may dwell in the land  and be fed. And when she feels the need of the Almighty's hand to sustain her, may she be enabled to apply that precious promise, "'IIis shield will be her buckler," These truths had been early im- planted in her young heart. They were the first  lessons taught her inquiring mind; but how fre- quently is it the case that those who receive " line upon line, and precept upon. precept," become, as it were, hardened by the very truth with which they are so familiar. Oh, may the eyes of her under- standing be opened, that she may be enabled to discern the beauty and holiness of the Christian character, and, as she treads the path of life alone i!   MARIAN  WALLACE.      167 and unfriended, trembling with apprehension, how soothing to her desponding heart, "Fear not, 1 am with thee, be not afraid, I am thy God. I will lead thee in the path which 'thou knowest not;" 'where thou mayest lay thee down in green pastures, and rest thy weary limbs, while I, the Lord, will cover thee with the banner of my love. Only love and serve me with thy wliole heart. It was a bitter, cold day in the latter part of November, in the year of--, when a merchant vessel reached its moorings at one of the wharves of the great city of New York. The passengers were of the better class of emigrants. Among the number was Marian-who stood upon the deck of that prolud ship, as she skimmed her way up the narrows-stretching her eye to gaze upon the forest of masts presented to her view. For the first time did the tears start to the eye of the wanderer, as she gained a bird's-eye view of the city where she must seek a home. Then did the forlornness of her situation appear, without the prismatic lustre of independence to dazzle her bewildered fancy. She felt she was an orphan, and a stranger in a strange land. You who have never left the hearth of affection -you who are encircled within the arms of love, are unable to enter inlto, and sympathize with a 8   168     MARIAN  WALLACE. poor emigrant, when he first plants his foot on your friendly soil. It is then home rushes like a mighty torrent across the wander heart-then comes that  weary, wasting sickness, prostrating the energies so necessary to the carrying out the plans formed for the future comfort of the wanderer. It is some- times years before his heart assumes its healthy  tone, sufficiently to enable him to carry ;out his views; and when he awakes from his lethargy, he  is startled at discovering the silvery threads of ap-  proaching old age, mingling with the auburn locks it had ever been his pride to adorn; the foot-prints  of time making their indelible impression on that  lofty brow-the lambent flame sparkling with less lustre from the windows of his soul. It is late to arouse the dormant powers of his soul; but for the  sake of the pledges of his affection, given by one,  who, probably, sleeps in the narrow house appointed i for all living, in that far-off home, where so many  years, his heart its vigil kept over the grave. Are not these the feelings of many an alien from  : the land of, his birth? Are they not, therefore, en-  titled to our sympathy, as far as we are able to i enter in, and understand the peculiar susceptibilities  of their nature. 'I   MARIAN   WALLACE.       169 CHAPTER   XI. "If I am traduced by tongues whkh neither know My faculties, nor person-yet will be The chronicles of my doings,-let me say, 'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake That virtue must go through." SIAKSPEARE's HENBY TUB EIGHTH. MARIAN threaded her way to the great thorough- fare, accompanied by the benevolent captain to whose care she was consigned, and by whom she was treated with fatherly affection during the voy- age, the remembrance of which, was as an oasis in the desert. Having engaged a room for her in a hotel in the'vicinity of his vessel, where he could look in frequently on his little lass, as he called her, he bade her adieu, and Marian was alone. We will now return to the desolate cottage, where so long she had been the sunbeam. There sat'Miss Woolsey, the untasted meal before' her, but where is she who enjoyed the quiet tea-hour with her? Perhaps the ocean is her winding-sheet, the coral reef her grave. "Oh Marian, Marian!". said she to 8   170     MARIAN WALLACE. -hrself, "why didst thou leave me? why didst thou forsake the only being on earth who felt for thee a-  mother's love " She had endeavored to control her feelings, when  Marian had announced her determination to leave her native land, in order that she might the better  provide such things as were necessary for the voy- age, as the time allotted for preparation was so  : short. And well was it for these two beings that the time was short, else the courage by which each i was sustained, would have given way. Miss Wool-  i sey had said all that she could to deter Marian,  and represented to her, the ingratitude and want of love her conduct left her chargeable with; the censure which she must expect to receive, when it became known how unkindly she had been treated by her; and even went so'far as to say, that it was t. her duty to retain her forcibly, as she was under  age. Marian's answer soothed, but did not satisfy Miss Woolsey, who knew well the danger to which she would be exposed, and the trials she would have  to encounter. All this she represented in a clear ii manner; but Marian obstinately refused to listen to :: these faithful representations, notwithstanding that they were made in a manner expressive of sincere :: interest in her welfare.              I Marian knew very little of the value of money;  i i -   MARIAN  WALLACE"      171 hitherto all her wants had been supplied. Was she provided with it bountifully Would she ap- preciate it in a way most bemneficial to her interest? When the subject was discussed, Marian declared her determination not to accept a farthing but what was hers by right. This was the gift of Mrs. Mor- timer, from time to time; and which had been carefully deposited by Miss Woolsey in Marian's  own name, which had accumulated sufficiently to defray all her necessary expenses and give her a well filled .purse. Miss Woolsey had been an early friend of Cap- tain MacPherson, to whose charge she confided the being of her love, with strict injunctions that she should return with him, being convinced the voy- age would prove a salutary lesson, to which Marian might, in after life, revert with thankfulness; and, probably, when Mrs. Leslie ascertained she had been the means of driving a young and inexpe- rienced girl from under the fostering care and pro- tection of those interested in her, to seek a home among strangers, she would probably relent, and insist upon Marian's yecall, with the assurance that henceforth no influence of hers should be brought to bear to cause her any future unhappiness. Should things assume such a favorable turn, how happy would the decline of life be made to her. The   172     MARIAN  WALLACE. issue, she thought, was in the hands of an all-wise  Providence, and she trusted He would guide the  wanderer to the haven of rest. "Oh, thou indul- gent parent, who hast ever heard the feeble peti- tions offered to the throne of thy heavenly grace in behalf of this child, vouchsafe to protect her in all her wanderings, shield her from the assaults of Satan, and, if it is thy holy will, that these eyes, now dim with age, should never behold the object  of my fondest solicitude, may I be enabled to say,  Thy will, not mine, be done."  How did Mrs. Leslie receive the tidings of Ma- rian's departure? With calm indifference. Her  - language was, "What an infinite and unspeakable satisfaction the departure of that girl affords me;  she ever appeared as a reproving monitor; and  then the extreme partiality Frank, displayed for  her,-who knows what might have arisen from it?   . The girl had ambition enough to turn it to some  I future account. If ever I was really glad of any  thing, it was to be rid of her presence; and if 3he could only be induced to remain permanently, I should not mind giving a few hundreds for that purpose. I shall hate, however, to meet my sancti- moniois friend, Miss Woolsey, after this unpleasant occurrence. I have no doubt the girl detailed faith- fully our last interview." i   MARIAN WALLACE.       173 These were the sentiments conveyed t9 Carleton, and in which he fully acquiesced with his lady patroness, alleging it was a rather fortunate cir- cumstance that the girl had taken herself off so opportunely. But how different were the feelings of Frank when he understood his Marian had gone. It was the first shade of grief which had darkened his youngmind. For his grandfather he had sorrowed; but how happy the change for him, celestial glories, for earth's fleeting joys! But his beloved Marian alone, and unhappy. Many were the plans formed in his youthful mind for her comfort, when he be- came of age. His anxiety to receive the earliest intelligence of the wanderer, led him frequently to Eglantine Cottage. Miss Woolsey had not informed Frank of her expectation tat Marian would return with Captain MacPherson. She thought how agree- able would be his surprise to find her at home to answer his hurried inquiry, "Any news, dear Miss Woolsey?" and then to see the dear girl burst upon his unexpected vision. When alone, Marian endeavored to brace her mind to meet her altered condition. She had health; she knew she had capabilities-but how were they to be properly applied for her support, without counsel in this great busy world? Marian, yielding   174     MARIAN WALLACE. to the despondency of her situation, wept tears of unfeigned sorrow. Had her heart been renewed, could she not have communed with her heavenly Father? Could she not have approached boldly to the throne of grace lay her wants before the Lord, believing and expecting to be instructed and guided by His almighty power. Marian could not ac- knowledge that she had committed her ways unto the Lord, for they that put their trust in Him shall never be desolate. She was like a reed shaken by the wind, the pride of her heart was un- subdued. Captain MacPherson's vessel was reloaded, and ready to return, when he declared his intention of taking Marian back. She looked steadily up in his honest sunburnt face: "Captain, are you serious?" said she. "Never more serious in my life," replied the- captain. "Don't you think you have had a sufficient taste of independence, my little lass, to go back and stay quiet, until some good-looking fellow, like myself, whisks you off to cheer his cottage.", Marian pondered for a few moments, and replied, "Captain, do you think they would laugh at me, if I should return?" "Laugh! and let them. I certainly think they would. I should laugh to see a little lass like you,   MARIAN  WALLACE.      175 tripping off to make a morning call, to the great republic, and back again in double quick time." "Then, captain, I shall not return with you." "Then, shiver my topsails, but you must." "No, captain, come what will, I will never re- turn to be laughed at for my folly, which has been great. I must bear the consequences, and endeavor to profit by them." "Now, Marian, don't look so determined. I re- ceived orders to that effect, before we left port." "Then why was I permitted to leave my native land, and seek a home among strangers?" "It was the wish of those whose best interest was exerted for your benefit. What on earth will you do here? Your education is incomplete, you are a very child in years and experience; be ad- vised-return with me, that you may gladden the hearts of your friends." Marian was inexorable, she chose to suffer even want and wretchedness rather than meet the sar- castic smile of Mrs. Leslie, to which she would inevitably be subjected. Though proud and inde- pendent, she was sensitive in the extreme, and when she parted from her friend, she felt that every link which bound her to home was severed. Marian was made as comfortable as the state of her feelings permitted, by the lady in whose   176     MARIAN WALLACE. charge she was placed by the captain; frequently would she enter and insist upon her joining her in her own pleasant room; but never could she induce Marian to open her lips to speak of herself. She saw that she was unhappy, but for what cause she could not ascertain; her heart yearned to- wards the desolate girl, and could she have gained her confidence would have been willing to befriend her. Poor Marian, her funds at this time were entirely exhausted. She had paid her last week's board, which had left her an empty purse-what was she to do? Where was she to go? With an agony of mind bordering on despair, she dressed herself hurriedly for a walk. It was a Sabbath morning- the turmoil of business had ceased, the calm, holy stillness of the Sabbath descended on that mercan- tile mart. The only sound that disturbed the calm repose, was the distant peal of the bells, wooing them to the house of God, where they might return thanks for the innumerable blessings with which they had been favored during the past week. Marian wandered on, scarcely heeding whither she went. Nor did she awake from her revery till she found herself in a vestibule of a church, entering with the gathering throng. She took her place near the door. The novelty of her situation, and   MARIAN  WALLACE.       1" the perfect unconsciousness of the motive which: had incited the action to enter the house of God, passed in quick review before her mind, until the servant of the Most High addressed the Giver. of Life and all its accompanying blessings, in a fervent and humble petition, that He would continue'.the blessings most needful to the human family, It was the first time that the voice of prayer had met the listening ear of Marian since she had kneeled by the side of her dear aunty, while in- voling blessings upon her who was about to leave her native land. So deeply was she affected that her sobs were audible. She was afraid to raise her head when the prayer was finished, and with a bowed knee and a troubled heart she listened to that beautiful hymn, read in a solemn and emphatic voice: "Jesus, lover of my soul, Let me to thy bosom fly; While the nearer waters roll, While the tempest still is nigh." Were not the billows of affliction rolling over her tempest-tossed heart. The prayer, hymn, and discourse, were so suitable to her peculiar situa- tion, that she left the church convinced that the minister must have been made acquainted with her condition. She had not walked more than 8*   178     MARIAN WALLACE. two squares from the church, when something be. came entangled in her foot; she kicked, as she supposed, the impediment out of her Way, but, taking a step or two further, it again became en- tangled; stooping down to see what the difficulty might be, she discovered a purse, whose glittering beads were caught in the lace of her boot. She took it up, and held it loosely in her hand, in order that the loser might be enabled to recog- nize his or her property. No claimant appearing during her walk home, she ascended to her room, curious as to the amount contained therein. What was her surprise, on discovering the precise sum of one week's board; no more and no less. Marian took it as a gift from heaven; her heart was touch- ed; kneeling down, she offered up her first prayer of' thankfulness to that God who feeds the ravens when they cry unto him. On the following morning she stated to Mrs. Campbell her desire to find some employment. "And what are you capable of doing ." Marian candidly acknowledged it was little she had ever done, but she was willing to try. "Well; if you are willing to work, I have no doubt I shall be able to find you some, but of course I canot recommend you until I ascertain what you are capable of."   MARIAN  WALLACE.      179 Going to her work-basket, and taking out a neat- ly done up roll, "Here," said she, " are the ma- terials of a shirt, and the pattern; I should like you to make it for me." Marian had never seen a shirt made in her life. What othe' pad accomplished, it was possible, with patience arla perseverance, she might also. She received the garment with fear and trembling; took it to her room and examined it carefully; it was a perfect enigma. Surmount it she must, for was not want staring her in the face? Patiently and diligently did she labor, nor did she rest until the field was won. And how was it accomplished -alone, and uninstructed? It proved almost an Herculean task. I will tell you, gentle reader, for your encouragement. She set to work and picked out the pattern, fashioned hers after, pre- served it, and was enabled to put hers in the same order. And in this way she instructed her- self in the making up of garments, until she be- came a neat sempstress. Mrs. Campbell was perfectly satisfied with the work, which encouraged her greatly. This was not the vocation she would have chosen.  Had she been allowed the privilege-her education had been conducted rather extensively; matter had been pressed upon her young mind in larger draughts o .   180     MARIAN WALLACE. than she was able to drink-and could she have had the choice, it would have been to dispense into juvenile minds, the knowledge she had ob- tained, and for this she was better fitted than to become a needle-woman. But Marian stopped not to cavil, glad of an opportunity to receive use- ful and profitable employment.) Mrs. Campbell was true to her promise. Marian was recommended. She proved herself faithful to her employers, and gained their esteem by her pa- tient industry. She was employed about this time by a family who enjoyed much of this world's goods. Mother and daughter, an only child, and her mother a widow.' Marian's meek and unpretending manner won upon the mother so far as to induce her to offer her a home. She was pleased with the pro- position, but hesitated to accept, lest the terms should be more than her slender means could af- ford. Mrs. Graham explained the terms which a residence with her would require. Marian could not coiply, for, in so doing, she, in a great meas- ure, forfeited the independence which had cost her so much suffering. She stated clearly and uhn- derstandingly, how much she would be able to pay, knowing it would be a small sum, for the comforts she would enjoy; but it was all she wj able to   MARIAN WALLACE.        181 pay, and on no othier terms would she become a resident in the family. This was adjusted to the entire satisfaction of all parties; and Marian took up her abode there permanently. Mrs. Graham was a woman of warm heart, but quick passions, her daughter was selfish and exact- ing-a kind word would allay the most violent storm which might agitate the bosom of the mother. Kind words, or even kinder acts, seldom, if ever, satisfied the selfishness of the daughter. Marian was grateful for the shelter this home afforded her; having made up her mind to meet difficulties, and endure with patience the trials that surrounded her path-and they were not a few-but the most galling to her sensitive mind was the indifference with which, as a sewing-girl, she was treated. Many a night was her pillow wet, through the un- 'kindness and neglect of some of her employers; and gladly did she escape from the arduous duties of twelve and fourteen hours' duration, without one kind word to cheer her lonely heart. You who employ this class of persons in your families, let me urge you to reform your manner of approaching them. They are not unfrequently members of a family impoverished by some un- foreseen calamity, over which they, as individuals, had no control, endowed, for the most part, with   182     MARIAN  WALLACE. refined and sensitive minds. Are not their feelings sufficiently harrowed by ceaseless toil, without their being made to feel still more their unfortunate position by the haughty manner in which you issue your commands, and the   ifference which you display towards their peonal comforts?  Is not the life of the sempstress a life of toil? There is no female you employ; accomplishes the same amount of work and receives so small a remunera- tion. You dare not treat your milliner or dress- maker as you do your sempstress.  They would not submit to your caprice.   MARIAN WALLACE.           183 CHAPTER XII. "Not for the summer hours alone, When skies resplendent shine, And youth and pleasure fill the throne, Our hearts and hands we twine; But for those stern and wintry days, Of peril, pain, and fear, Which Heaven's wise discipline doth make, This earthly journey drear." MRS. SIGOURNEY. CAPTAIN MACPHERSON    arrived safely at B--, He made his way quickly to Eglantine Cottage, to communicate the unpleasant intelligence of his in- ability to persuade Marian to return. Miss Woolsey was so overcome by the intelli- gence, that she was obliged to be carried to her room.  Hope deferred had made her heart sick. The ingratitude of Marian's conduct had chilled her aunt's affection; but she could not cease to love the being on whom   she had lavished her wealth of affection.  She knew  Mrs. Leslie, had treated Marian unkindly; but was that a sufficient reason why she should forsake her in her old age? Oh   184     MARIAN WALLACE. Marian, Marian! may the love of your heart never ' be thrown back with indifference! May you never endure the anguish which your unkindness over- whelms me with! There is not an extenuating cir- cumstance sufficiently tangible to enable me to view your conduct in a favorable light. What if others treated you with scorn to which your proud spirit is unable to submit! Had Miss Woolsey known precisely the nature of the cause? had she been made acquainted with the indignity which had been heaped upon her in her last interview with Mrs. Leslie? Marian had prudently refrained from relating the language ad- dressed to her by that lady, knowing how deeply it would have pained her dear aunty. Mrs. Leslie gladly availed herself of Miss Wol- sey's state of mindi, in relation to Marian's conduct. Insidious were. the arguments. she made use of to convince her that Marian was unworthy of the affection she had bestowed upon.-helr. "Ntone de- plores more deeply than I, the nmanner she has acted in relation to the duties she owes to you, who have been to her mbie than a mother. I have seen much in her conduct to disapprove; moreover, that she required strict discipline, which your unbounded affection, and the natural amiability of your dis- positioli, prevented your seeing. I have looked z   I@X;     MARIAN WALLACE.        185 upon her with impartial eyes, yet hoping, against hope, to find something redeeming in the girl. Hitherto my efforts have been ineffectual. What are the disappointing of my hopes in comparison with yours, who have looked forward to the fil- filment of your wishes?" "Mrs. Leslie, spare my absent Marian. I ac- knowledge she has disappointed me; but is not a lesson enjoined on us, to keep ourselves from idols? I feel deeply sensible that injunction has been dis- regarded by me. I have cherished an idol, and my heavenly Father has called upon me to lay that idol upon the altar, declaring that he is a jealous God, and will not permit the affections of His children to wander to forbidden objects. And I also know that those whom He loves He chastens. , Let me, therefore, bow in humble submission to His chastisement." Mrs. Leslie found that her malevolence had car- ried her beyond the bounds of prudence. She wished to conciliate Miss Woolsby, having discov- ered she was entirely ignorant of the nature of her last interview. She was kind and assiduous in her attention to the invalid. Spring, with all its buds and blossoms; summer, with all its gay flowers and luscious fruits, had yield-   186     MARIAN WALLACE. ed to the yellow waving corn of autumil ere Miss. Woolsey was pronounced convalescent. Mrn. Leslie relaxed not her. attentions, but in- sisted on her friend joining her at Shirly Park, where change of scene would enable her to re- cover from the languor of her sickness, caused by agitation of mind. "Caroline, by her affectionate manner, will dis- pel the gloom which still hangs over your mind, my dear friend. I have no doubt your anxiety will be relieved by tidings of the truant. Take my word for it, she is enjoying her emancipation amazingly, or else we shoul have heard of her whereabouts before this." And how was the truant enjoying her long-sought emancipation? Toiling up the acclivity with a patient industry, in order that her temporal wants might be supplied, independent of any assistance she might receive if she would state her circum- stances to her dear aunty. "Have I not voluntarily chosen this path?" said Marian to herself; "why then should I burden my friends; though I' suffer, never will I com- plainl never will I seek assistance. I will now toil and endure." Such were the thoughts that passed through Marian's mind, as she diligently plied her needle,   ,t1     MARIAN  WALLACE.      187 in a retired part of a princely establishment in the upper part of our city. Toil and the fear of want had sunk her spirit; she was no longer the Marian of former days. The lady of this princely establishment was re- clining on a luxuriant couch, whose color height- ened the carnation on her cheek; her soft and snowy hand shaded her lovely eyes from the bril- liant rays. of the sun, whose beams penetrated through the Venetian blinds, and fell annoyingly on the pages of the volume she was perusing. Marian ever and anon looked uip at the beautiful being reclining before her; the stillness was broken in upon by the voice of the lady, in a very arbi- trary tone. "You wench, close those blinds." Marian looked up to see who had entered, never for a moment supposing the command was ad- dressed to her. "Stupid, do you not see I am blinding my eyes by that sun?" Marian sat unmoved, quietly pursuing her work. "Do you hear, girl? I wish you to shut those blinds." "Mrs. Sydney, I am' not in the habit of com- plying with commands issued in such an unlady- like manner."   188     MARIAN  WALLACE.         ' "'Why, you half-starved wretch-glad to be fed from my table-dare you address a lady in her  own house'as you have done?"  "Yes, when that lady forgets she is talking to ! her superior in every thing but wealth." "You, indeed, who probably were starving in your own country like many of your nation; yet when you are permitted to enter a gentleman's house, assume the airs and manners of those you : are brought in contact with." "( hope I shall ever remain uncontaminated by  the ladylike manners before me, and as, by your account, I was starved in my native land, I shall  be the better able to want in that of my adoption. I certainly should prefer feeling the pinching of hunger to being indebted to your table;" and 'Marian rose from her work with all the hauteur she could assume. "You certainly are not going to leave my work in that unfinished state " " "I most assuredly am." "Thlen I shall inform the whole circle of my ac- quaintances, which you know are very numerous.  You shall be deprived of all the employment in  my power." "Madam, had you expressed any other senti-    MARIAN  WALLACE.      189 ments than those just uttered, I acknowledge I should have mistaken your character." Mr. Sydney, the husband' of this amiable lady, was one of Caledonia's hearty and intelligent sons, educated in the free-school of Inverness. Bravely had he fought his way to eminence in the mercan- tile world, being at this time a very wealthy ship- ping merchant, living in princely elegance, and supplying all the wishes of his indolent, but beauti- fiul wife. She was the daughter of a rich Southern planter. Mr. Sydney had come into the possession of a number slaves as a portion of his wife's prop- erty; but not being able to see clearly his right to dispose of them under the hammer, on his re- moval to the North, he had hired them to different masters, and appropriated the proceeds to the use of Mrs. Sydney, as pin-money. Anxiously did Mrs. Sydney wait the return of her husband from the counting-room in the evening. she faithfully recapitulated to him the scenes of the morning, declaring her intention of relating all the circumstances to her female friends, in order that the audacious creature might not be able to obtain employment. "But, my dear wife," said Mr. Sydney, "if that girl has been impertinent, you certainly, by your own confession, drew it forth, and were you to cir-   190     MARIAN  WALLACE. culate it among your friends, believe me, the fault would not rest on the humble sempstress, but on my beautiful wife." The ladies here have an amiable way of issuing their commands, though the same haughty spirit may actuate them, and the same indifference be manifested for the comfort of those in their employ; the veil of polite and amiable manners prevents the disgraceful scene of this morning. "I am sorry my wife has so far forgotten herself as to contend with her sempstress. I trust she has taught you a lesson not to exhibit your -un- governable temper towards those you employ." "A lesson, indeed, Mr. Sydney; the only thing I regret in the affair, is the loss of her services. She was an excellent needle-woman, and very swift, and as she is a stranger, and unacquainted with our customs, I paid her just one half what I should have to give another."  "And do you feel justified in the course you have pursued in relation to that young girl?" I can sympathize with the condition of the poor emigrant, who-for many months toiling for an un- principled employer, who takes advantage of his ignorance-performs a double amount of labor, in his endeavor to give satisfaction, and receives in return about one foui'th as his reward. Shame   -       IMARIAN WAILACE.      191 on the man or woman who commits suhe robbery. Many an elegant equipage rolling tlrough our streets has the poor emigrant laborer provided for its occupants, who never consider that for all this they must render an account. Beautiful is the superstructure on which the laws of this land are raised; why should it beauty be destroyed by the avaricious spirit of a few, who in their eounting ri looms exultingly declarle how many they have over- reached? forgetting that he that maketh haste to be rich, unjustly, is an abomination to the Lord. Marian returned to the house of Mrs. Graham muhell dejected, her situation was peculiarly trying- no letter from loved ones at home. Forsaken she felt herself to be, but would not the Lord take her up? Iow much did that poor girl feel the need of that friend who sticketh closer than a brother. Long nd earnest was the converse she held, carefully did she analyze the true state of her heart, and when weighed in the balance she was found want- ing. When Marian joined the family circle of Mrs. Graham in the evening, she there met a stranger, who was introduced to her as a distant relative of that lady's, who had just returned to his native land after an absence of some years. ie was a perfect model of manly beauty, though emrbrowned   192     MARIAN WALLACE. by a long residence in a warm climate and a long voyage. She had often heard Fanny Graham speak of this relative in terms of the highest commenda- tion. His appearance was certainly very prepos- sessing, and his- conversation both instructive and amusing. Yet he certainly appeared much younger than Fanny, to whom he was an object of interest. It would have afforded Marian much more satisfac- tion had it not been his intention to prolong his stay with his relative. The presence of strangers always threw such a restraint across her manner, of which she was perfectly conscious she congratulated her- self, however, that her employment took her away during the day, and only a portion of the evening ,would she be obliged to meet him. The following morning James and Fanny Graham were loitering over the breakfast-table, talking of the friends and acquaintance of former years. 'By the way, how long have you had the addi- tion I find here to your family? who and what is she " 'eO dear, she is an orphan my mother picked up somewhere; who she is, or where she came from, I have never taken the pains to inquire, nor is it at all probable, if I were to make the effort, would she condescend to enlighten me. It is so provoking in mother to insist upon my associating with one   MARIAN  WALLACE.      193 who earns her living by her needle. I am so fre- quently annoyed by persons asking me if she is a relative of ours." Ere the two long-separated friends had arisen from the table, the knock of the postman was heard at the door. "Dear James, were you not -at my side, how my heart would palpitate at that well-known sound." She had scarcely finished the sentence, when the girl entered, and laid a foreign-looking letter on the table; it wa, directed to Marian. "Now, we 'have an opportunity of ascertaining who, and what Marian is, without her ever being the wiser," lifting up the letter, and showing a dis- position to break the seal. Mr. Graham laid his hand on that of Fanny: "Would you wish to discover the secret of one whom. you say is an orphan, clandestinely? No! let me think better of my Fanny. But come, dear Fanny, your good mother has given me permission to take you under my special protection for this day, that you may be my guide, to the residence of many whose friendship I wish to renew." A day in the society of Mr. Graham was calcu- lated to chase the cloud from Fanny's brow, for she was humbled beneath the gaze of those dark ;  lustrous eyes, fixed reproachingly upon her, as he   1*94     MARIAN WALLACE. laid his hand on the one which grasped the letter of Marian's. I need not tell how the lone heart of the orphan was gladdened after the labors of the day, when Mrs. Graham put the long wished for letter into her hands. It told of the illness of her dear aunty, and of the death of little Emma Stanhlope, who had breathed her last in Miss Woolsey's arms. Also, it gave an account of her dear Frank, who had entered the army, in accordance with his father's wishes; aid it' spoke of the ineffectual efforts her aunt had made, to hear from her during her illness. The address given by Captain MacPherson lhad been either lost or mislaid, and she had been unable to obtain another, as he had sailed for the East Indies; and as there was little hope that' a letter would reach him, there was nothing left but to wait patiently for his return, as Marian had failed to write and make known her address. Miss Graham found Marian weeping tears of joy; she felt that she was not forsaken by the dear aunty" by whom  me had been cherished and idolized,. Though a mighty ocean rolled between them, still were they one in heart-still would the voice of prayer, morning and evening, ascend in her behalf; and well did she know the fervency of those pe- titions. Often in the midnight hour did she recall   I *I MARIAN WALLACE.            195 to mind the voice of her beloved friend, wrestling in, prayer in her behalf, when too young to feel their need; 'but would these prayers, thought she; lose their efficacy, through her negligent inatten- tion to the concerns of her immortal soul? Oh! that the light of the spirit of love would descend and illuminate her soul, and enable her to discover the utter degradation of an unregenerated heart, living without God in the world. The precepts of religion had been carefully instilled into her young heart; but affliction was the means by which God designed she should hear His voice. Marian busied herself with preparation for retiring, lest Fanny should discover she had been weeping; but she was too much engrossed with the attention she had received from Mr. Graham during the day. "Oh Marian, I have had such a pleasant day." "I am happy to think you enjoyed  yourself, Fanny." "James is so agreeable; he says so many flatter- ing things!" "Is flattery agreeable to your taste, Fanny?" "Why not? 'But enough of this, Marian; you received a letter this morning, who was it from? I did not know  you had friends; do tell me all abouti yourself and your friends, I am dying to know."   196     MARIAN WALLACE. "And I have not the slightest inclination to gratify your curiosity, Fanny." "You are such a strange, reserved girl, I hardly know what to make of you." "Living so entirely alone makes it the moro necessary for me to' be reserved, and, believe me, there is nothing in my history that would interest you. All that is necessary for strangers to know, you have been made acquainted with-that I am an orphan who have sought your shores, where, I understand, the laborer is considered worthy of his hire; and I hope you will never revert to this subject again." As Fanny laid her head upon her pillow, she thought, had James Graham not prevented, I should have known ere this; but I am determined to fer- ret it out, with all your secrecy. Marian could not indulge the luxury of solitude, occupying, as she did, a room with the daughter of Mrs. Graham, except in the dead of the night, when her companion slept. After these vigils, when she renewed the labors of the day unrefreshed, na- ture sank with this double exertion. MLarian lost the elasticity of stepwhich bespeaks health, her form became attenuated, but still she complained not. To whom could she complain? to whom look for sympathy? who cared whether the lonely or-   MARIAN WALLACE.        197   phan was sick, so long as she was able to do her work? That was all-sufficient; but iHe who tem- pers the wind to the shorn lamb, looked with com- passion on her. Marian was enabled to rest her all in the hand of that gieat Physician. I[ i  During her sickness, she received much kind attention from James Graham. There was such a j  friendliness of manner displayed in all his little  attentions, that it soothed her lonely heart. Very seldom did he enter into conversation, seeming to be aware how much it disconcerted her to con- verse with strangers; and grateful did she feel when able to resume her aceustomed employment. How impatiently Fanny Graham awaited the re- turn of her mother, that she might communicate the unpleasant intelligence. Mr. Graham had ob- tained tickets for the grand oratorio at the Taber- nacle, but the most provoking part was, he intended inviting Marian to accompany them. "Was there ever any thing so absurd, mother?" said she. "Well, my daughter, if you consider that so ab- surd, I fear you will think the invitation I am the bearer of still more so. Mrs. Freeman includes her in ours 'for Wednesday evening. I am glad she was so very considerate." "And do you really think, mother, that Marian will accept?"   198     MARIAN  WALLACE. "I see no reason why she should decline; as a member of my family, she is entitled to courtesy." "But, mother, she has never been in society where she could learn. She would appear awk- ward and ill-bred, which, of course, would make us feel uncomfortable. Let me not blush for her rusticity. Don't say any thing about Mrs. Free- man's invitation. We will consider it settled, that she goes to the oratorio with James and myself." "Fanny, to gratify you, I submit to an act which my better judgment convinces me is unjust." The evening of Mrs. Freeman's party arrived. Fanny was radiant with smiles, James all attention; Marian gave the last finishing touch to-the rather elaborate toilet of Miss Graham. Mrs. Graham felt rather indisposed, and preferred a quiet evening at home. On their way to the house of Mrs. Freeman, James remarked: "I think it very strange Marian was not invited; as a member of your family, I think she ought to have been." "You know how very particular Mrs. Freeman is," replied Fanny, " in regard to whom she admits within her circle, and their acquaintance is not suf- ficient to warrant the acceptance of an invitation on Marian's part even if it had been given." They were received by the polite hostess with the greatest cordiality; when about to express her   MARIAN  WALLACE.      199 regret for Fanny's mother, as James supposed, she was interrupted, much to the apparent relief of Fanny. James had no further opportunity of con- versing with Mrs. Freeman during the early part of thel/evening, nor till Fanny withdrew to the dressing-room to prepare for her return. M1rs. Freeman expressed her regret that the deli- cate state of Marian's health prevented her joining them. "There is no one," said she, "whose com- pany would have given me more pleasure, she is the most retiring and unassuming person I have ever met; I long to become more familiarly ac- quainted with her; I often think she must be very unhappy. Don't you think so, Mr. Graham?" Their conversation was interrupted by the en- trance of Fanny, who declared herself equipped for her return home, and expressed her fears that her dear mother might be disturbed by her late hours. This was such a drawhack, she said, to her joining her friends more frequently, but she could make an exception in favor of Miss Free- man, who was proverbial for early hours. "How blessed," said Mrs. Freeman, " must Mrs. Graham be, with such a dutiful daughter." James Graham kept his own counsel, and said nothing as to how far he had been enlightened by the con- versation of his amiable friend.   200     MARIAN   WALLACE. CHAPTER   XIII. Yes, 'tis mine to bear alone, The trials from my Father's throne; To look with calm, yet tearful eye, To Him who said, fear not-'tis I. FRoM that time it might have elicited some re- mark, how frequently his business led James in the direction that Marian usually took to reach her home, and how   frequently he excused himself, when near her residence, as having forgotten some yery particular instruction, which he must impress on the mind of his men. He would then politely raise his hat and bid her adieu. This made very little impression on Marian, as her mind was fill- ed with imagery of the past; not ihalt she was un- grateful to Mr. Graham  for his cheerful words and pleasant smiles; she was too unsophisticated- even if memory, with a limner's power, kept the portraits of loved ones forever in her mind-to un- derstand the nature of his attentions. James had long discovered the feelegs which   MARIAN  WALLACE.      201 agitated the bosom of his relative. To admire Fanny, even if she were-of a suitable age, with her duplicity and selfishness of character, was a fault he dare not commit. She was fascinating, and appeared to advantage in society, but would that repay the want of those sterling qualities so necessary to domestic bliss? No, the partner of his bosom, the sharer of his joys, the soother of his sorrows, must have a freedom from disguise, a friank kindliness of heart, accompanying, if needs be, a plain exterior; not that he disdained beauty; he admired a-lovely casket when it enshrined the costly jewel of the soul, but his taste must be- come subservient to his judgment. The more Graham saw of the desolate orphan in her loneliness, the more was he, convinced that she was calculated to make him happy. How to ad- dress her was the next question; sometimes he de- terminied to enlist Mrs. Graham in his cause; but the more he thought of enlisting her services, the more he became convinced of the imprudence of such. a step; being devoted to her daughter, Mrs. Graham must necessarily be acquainted with her predilection in his favor, in which case she would be rather an inefficient advocate. When can a third person make known our wishes satisfactorily to the object of our affection? Can a third per- 9*   202 '    MARIAN WALLACE. son express the depth of love by which we are agitated, so as to awake an answering chord in the bosom of our beloved? James resolved not to trust his happiness to an uninterested party, but to wait patiently for a propitious moment, when he might declare the desire of his heart to her who was the arbitress of his fate. So securely did Fanny repose on the fragrant pillow of self-esteem, that she became careless of concealing her haughty and overbearing manner. Bitterly, however, did she repent the self-love which had prompted her to disregard the noble qualities of her cousin's nature, for he humbled her with an overwhelming sense of her own inferiority. She still feared no rival, and thought of redoubling her charms, when a sufficient time had elapsed to convince him of her penitence. James Graham scorned the proud and haughty girl, who could unblushingly sacrifice the happiness of a fellow-being for her own personal interest. Often did he regret the consanguinity which united them. She and her mother were all that death had left him to look upon, of a large and loving family. After a voluntary exile from his native land, in order to improve his prospects in life, and in the hope of acquiring the means of liquidating the debts his father had contracted dufripg his life-   MARIAN  WALLACE.      203 time, and which had rendered him insolvent at the time of his death, James's labors had been crowned with success, ard he had repaid his father's creditors the amount due, with interest. He could' now raise his head among his compeers, with his own and his father's name untarnished, and had the satisfaction of enjoying the esteem which the moral rectitude of his dealings entitled him to. Though possessing many noble qualities, he' was far from perfect, being an ardent seeker after the pleasures of this world; the indulgence of which destroys the faculties, shortens lif6, and causes premature old age. How often man is wooed by the syren--the voice' of the charmer meets his willing ear, and cheer- fully does he resign himself to her seductive sway, heeding not the admonition of loving ones, who gaze with eyes dim with weeping, on the wreck of the destroyed, lovingly shielding them when the piercing winds have blighted their fondly cherished flower. How lovely does-the female character ap- pear, when woman is enabled to take back the wanderer to her heart, who has blighted every bud of promise which may have bloomed in the tree of love, which was watered by the earnest prayer and fond solicitation of him, to whom she has plighted her troth, but who, in an hour of temptation, falls, probably to rise no more. Happy are they,   2041     IARIAN WALLACE. who, in their wretchedness, have the devoted love of wife, mother, or sister to sustain them, when the pleasures of the world have engendered satiety, though their prayers and expostulations could not) stay them in their headlong course to destruction. Has not their love raised a strong bulwark of de- fence around them in their helplessness, wlen, like the prodigal, they have come to themselves? What will woman not endure for the object of her affec- tions  Marian labored to accomplish the one gieat end she had in view, that of supporting herself by her own exertions, and storing her mind with useful knowledge, to effect which she must subtract from the portion of time allotted for repose, and gladly did she accept, and highly did she appreciate the, privilege extended to her by her different employers, after the labors of the day, to select from their well filled libraries books calculated to improve and elevate her character. Promiscuous reading has its injurious effects. She was not able to discrimi- nate, at all times, which were the most emineht or instructive authors. Her docile mind grasped all that came within its reach: Many a brilliant thought burned with undying lustre in the mind of that once haughty, but now subdued girl, whom Mr. Graham hovered around, waiting for an op-   MARIAN  WALLACE.      205 portunity to declare the sentiments he had long entertained for her. So reserved was she in her manner, that any approach to familiarity on his part, banished her from his presence. That was a penance he had no desire to have inflicted un- necessarily. Fanny watched with intense solicitude the amiable countenance of her cousin when in the society of Marian, and the calm indifference he assumed when conversing with herself. She dis- covered also Marian's apparent insensibility to his admiration, which provoked her beyond endurance, -that a poor; friendless girl should have attracted the attention of a friend of hers, retaining her hold upon his affection by her seeming indifference, which she thought must only be a ruse, that her vanity might be gratified. "Tle artful, detestable creature! I shall unmask her. She shall never practice her deceptions upon one I esteem and respect so highly, independent of the relationship we sustain to each other. A pretty thing, indeed, that a Graham is, brought to bow to that haughty, inde- pendent piece of mortality, whose very look would annihilate one for the presumption of gazing upon her; James Graham is a fool!" Fanny, true to her threat, rated Marian soundly for hi e part she was acting towards her relative, aiter their retiring for the'night. Marian was in- i-",$ I    206     MARIAN WALLACE. dignant to be charged with duplicity, when con- scions of her own integrity. She was so over: whelmed with the charge, as to be unable to ex- press her indignation in aught save tears, the bit- terest she had ever shed. Was she to be ever misunderstood? What was James Graham to her? Nothing! Was she to be informed at this moment she must never behold him again, what amount of pain would the intelligence impart? None! He was pleasant and agreeable, but at times he annoyed and troubled her; not by any rudeness, for he had ever treated her with polite considera- tion. How was she to appear in his presence again? for she doubted not Fanny would inform hilm she was acting a double part, in order to win his affec- tions. She would accept an offer which had been made of a lucrative situation in a neighboring city; alnd; by that means, silence forever the false accu- sation. Filled with the thoughts of putting into 'practice immediately her determination, Marian laid her head upoi the pillow, but not to sleep. This was one of the disagreeables of life, for which Marian' was unprepared, having no earthly being to whom she could unburden her surcharged mind. But had she not the King of kings and Lord of lords for her Father and Friend. Would he not lend a lis-   'r"     MARIAN  WALLACE.       207 tening ear to the weakest of her complaints? Had he not, from her earliest infancy, guided and in- structed His humble servants how to promote her best earthly good? and would He now forsake her, when her feeblest efforts were put forth in her endeavor to serve him.  No!  Marian, be not faithless, but believe that all things work together for good to those that love and serve the Lord. Though dark may be the horizon of your young existence, through the perfidy of your fellow-crea- ture, the light of the Lord's countenance, reflected on thy soul, Will illumine the darkest passage of life's history. Fear not to trust the blessed Saviour with thy sorrow, who, when on earth, was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. He knows every pang his humble ones endure.  Lean upon His loving bosom, by faith, in every hour of ex- tremity, who is able and willing to succor all who are tempted. Marian did seek counsel from that Lawgiver who issued his commands amid the thunders of Sinai, declaring himself to be the great I Am, before whose glory His own peculiar people prostrated themselves in the dust. That God is ours, who deigns to take knowledge 'of our ways, and direct our steps when we yield ourselves Iis willing and obedient servants.   MARiAN WALLACE.  The natural tendency of Marian's disposition was, to vindicate herself from any unjust accusation with which she might be charged. Grace had reformed much which was deficient in her character, had enabled her to control, in a great measure, those impetuous bursts of temper so destructive to her peace, and kept her ever watchful, lest in an un- guarded moment, she might wound the Saviour she professed to serve. "Better stay and endure the wrong where I am known, than to seek a home elsewhere, and among strangers. James Graham knows I do not love him now-never shall. Would he be the person my dear beloved aunty would be willing to confide the happiness of her darling child to?"  Mrs. Graham treated Marian with more than her wonted cordiality, in order to make amends for the unkind remarks made by her daughter, which had come to her knowledge. She had gratefully ac- knowledged the kind feeling which actuated Mrs. Graham, who loved young Graham   as her son. Nothing would have afforded her such unspeakable happiness, as the knowledge that Fanny was the object of his regard. Gladly would she have re- signed her to his keeping, though it must be con- fessed, he was a man of the world; in its pleasures he found a gratification, for which lie sought. Were    MARIAN WALLACE.   209   they satisfying? Could a being whose soul was the seat of every honorable sentiment, enjoy, unalloyed, the pleasures that the world bestows? In the pri- vacy of his own chamber, would not the spectre ot time wasted in frivolous amusements, rise up con- demnatory to his vision? Mrs. Graham determined to ascertain precisely, the state of Marian's feeliigs, in relation to the happiness of her young relative. She could not bear that his peace should be destroyed intention- ally, by one whom she considered free from artifice, never having been able to discover the slightest predilection in his favor; yet her daughter's asser- tion was not without its influence, though, that as- sertion had been made to the young orphan in rather an indelicate manner, inflicting unnecessary pain and mortification, from which she would will- ingly shield her. Perhaps Ihr daughter's powers of perception were more clear tlan her own. When young people associate with each other, they, of course, have an opportunity of discovering the pe- culiarities of their dispositions. James Graham  was piqued by the cold and distant bearing Marian assumed  whenever he presented himself. Formerly, there was a timid avoidance, which rather enhanced the pleasure he enjoyed, of being able, not unfrequently, to cast   210     MARIAN WALLACE. the timid shadow from her brow; now she treated him as though lhe were an iceberg, the sound -of whose voice, or the touch of whose hand might congeal her into an iicile. "Now I suppose," said he to himself, 'I must wait and get thawed into the good graces which I have been waiting to do for the last two years; possibly that amiable cousin of mine has exerted her influence to keep the mercury at zero. At all events, I am determined not to break my learit, but to enjoy life. What inducement does the theatre or Tammany offer for this evening. Now I have it, Fanny Kemble performs at the Park, with her sire; I will hie me there, and behold her radi- ant with all her charms, the cadence of whose  voice, the grace of whose gesture shall dispel all the unpleasant sensations I experience."' With all Graham's rhapsodies of delight which he should experience in listening to the then dis- tinguished star, whither is he hastening? Not to the Park Theatre, for we find him directing his steps in quite an opposite direction. He walked farther than usual before he met the object he was in search of, probably, in consequence of the brisk pace he had kept. Marian blushed, and ap- peared surprised to see him. "Good evening, Marian," said Graham, extend- ing his hand, which was slightly touched by her,   r        MARIAN WALLACE.        2" and not relinquished until he drew it within his arm, and retained rather against. her inclination, nor could she withdraw it without positive rude- ness. 'Marian, I have much, very much I wish to say to you; have I your permission to speak?" "Certainly, Mr. Graham, you have my permis- sion, believing you as I do, to be incapable of saying aught to offend one destitute of friends." "Thank you, for the good, opinion entertained of me, may I never give you reason to withdraw it; though, probably, what I am about to commu- nicate this evening, may offend; nevertheless, I must make it, and hear froim your own lips the sentence which pronounces my fate.  Marian, I love you; for two years have I steadfastly pur- sued an object-that of awakening an interest in your affections. Never have I been able to dis- cover any thing but indifference. Your recent cold- ness has driven me to the last extremity-that of ascertaining lwether I can ever be aught but in- different to you." The avowal was so unexpected, that it took away the power of utterance, which Graham attributed to indignation at his presump- tion. "Marian, if I have offended you, forgive me, probably your affections are engaged, if so, you need not be afraid of my preting my suit; only be candid, for the happiness of my life depends on your decision."    212     MARIAN  WALLACE. "Mr. Graham, your declaration was so unex- pected, that I am entirely unprepared to answer you in a proper and becoming, manner. I thank you for the honor you have conferred; it deserves a better return than I have to bestow. I like you as a friend, admireJpyou as a man, but love for you, I have none. My affections are disengaged, if they may be called so, when every breath is laden with love for dear ones at home. Is there not one there who shares a larger amount for which I plead? Yes! there is one around whom my affec- tions are entwined, for whom I would sacrifice life, if needs be. Oh! did you but know the depth of love-did you but know the anxiety, the suspense, the pain and sickness they have endured, assuredly you would confess the love of a lifetime were but a small recompense."' "Marian, I was not aware your affections were engaged. I promise not to press my suit. And could you have had your  int head pillowed on a loving breast, your wishes supplied, youi wanits attended to, with the affecfion of a mother?" "Oh! Mr. Graham, you could not have been so cold as not to be sensible of such kindness."  "But, Marian, it is seldom we are called upon to perform benefits such as these; and when we do, ingratitude is often the coin in which we receive payment."   Z. I 111.AIN W ALJLACE.   213 "Never can I be ungrateful to her, who has done so much for me." "Marian, did I understand you to say it was a female, around whom. the love of your heart gath- ered in such massive folds, as to prevent the rays of another, no less true and lasting, to penetrate?" "Mr. Graham, cold and insensible should I be, did. I not return the wealth of affection which has been bestowed upon me, from my earliest recollec- tion, by one, whom 1 shall love and yenerate while the lamp of light illumines this clay tenement."' "Marian, will you not permit me, by declaring I am not indifferent to you, to lay a portion of my affection on the altar of your filial love and grati- tude. Love me, that I may love her who has done a mother's part for my Marian." "Mr. Graham, I have told you I respect you, more than that I am unprepared to assert. Am I at liberty to make known the, subject of this evening's conversation to Mrs. Graham?l" "Certainly, if you wish it. Only remain unin- fluenced, that when I receive your decision, I may know what are the feelings with which you regard me. Keep me not long in suspense. Adieu, my dear Marian. Excuse me to my friends this even- ing." Marian entered the abode which bore the desig- nation of home, in a much more excited state' than   214     MARIAN  WALLACE. she had left it in the morning. Looking il upon the family in the sitting-room, she sought the pri- vacy of her own room, where she poured out her heart in humble petition to the throne of grace, for counsel, to enable her to accept or reject the love which was offered to her. Tile desire of her heart was to do the will of her heavenly Father. No favorable opportunity offered during the evening for a private conversation with Mrs. Graham, which she regretted exceedingly. She was, consequently, forced to defer it to an indefinite period, which gave her an opportunity of discovering the advantages and disadvantages which might accrue from such an alliance. Being fancy free, the better able was she to judge impartially. The declaration of his affections had wakened an interest, it being the first sound of any thing like affection which had fallen upon her ear since the day when the loved associations of childhood and youth had been severed, and she had bade a sorrowful farewell to scenes which, in all proba- bility, she would never behold again. The very - atmosphere had breathed a requiem in unison with her feelings. Would words of love again fall upon her listening ear? Would endearing epithets be again addressed to one so long a stranger to their soothing melody? Marian consulted with Mrs. Graham on the pro-   g;      31-MARIAN WALLACE.      215 priety of her receiving the addresses of James, stating the precise feeling she entertained for him. "Marian, James loves you; unless you feel sure you can return his love, as you value your peace of mind, let not his worldly prospects influence you. Situated as you arc, it must necessarily have a bearing on your decision." "My dear Mrs. Graham, add not miercenary motives to the catalogue of my many faults. I could not offer my love, unsought, not being aware of the sentiments lie entertained for me, and not on the first discovery." "Marian, I do not wish you to act in an un- maidenly manner; but James's welfare is dear to me next to my daughter., You are young and alone, anld your situation necessarily requires a protector. James seeks his pleasure in the things of this life, you, I think, are striving to obtain joys unfading at God's right hand. He is volatile; you are mod- est and retiring. There is an utter dissimilarity of taste and disposition. Do you think love will be sufficient to make them harmonize? If so, you have iny entire approbation; and may you be hap- py in the choice of your heart. I must also tell you, I am pleased'with the confidence you have reposed in me. Any advice or instruction, I can impart, will afford me much satisfaction to bestow."   21(6      MARIAN   WALLACE. CHAPTER XIV. "But which, oh, erring child, From home so long beguiled, Which of thine offerings won those words of heaven- That o'er the bruised reed, Condemned of earth to bleed, In music passed 'thy sins are all forgiven.' MRS. HEMANS. MARIAN felt relieved when she had unbosomed herself to Mrs. Graham, and much better enabled to give a satisfactory answer to James, who was waiting with the utmost impatience, and    gladly did he receive it, leaving time to accomplish and mature the love which she ingenuously declared she possessed not.  Her friendship she cordially offered for his acceptance. One of the writers of the day hath declared that "friendship is a dangerous word for woman; that it is love, full fledged, -and ready to fly the first fair day." In this sentiment Graham  fully acquiesced.  Marian bore patiently the torrents of reproach poured forth from Fanny's viol of indignation, when she was made acquainted with their engagement, which was duly announced   MARIAN  WALLACE.      217 to her by Graham himself. To him she was ever the same affectionate Fanny. The marriage was postpcned until Marian had received the sanction of her beloved aunt. Six months passed in rapid succession ere they received the letter which announced her approbation. Hap- pily had sped those days while waiting the slow motion of the vessel, whose prow was turned home- ward, though often a shade of sadness would flit across Marian's -brow, as she' contrasted her con- dition as the betrothed of Graham. "Fear not, dear Marian; your aunt, I have no doubt, will sanction and bless our union. What say you to a trip to receive her congratulations?" "James, your business demands your presence here; it is my duty to remain by your side." "Spoken like a dear, good wife-which is to be." Marian Wallace's bridal day was calm  and beautiful; not a cloud tinged the azure sky, as blushingly she came forth, leaning on the arm of him, to whom but one hour before-she had plighted her vows. There was a calm serenity beaming from her hazel eye, which was turned ever and. anon upward, to meet the flash of those brilliant dark ones bent so lovingly upon her. As the wife of the gay and handsome Mr. Graham, she found her- self an object of much more interest than the ob- 10   218     MARIAN WALLACE. scure sempstress, in the society where she was intro- duced by her husband. Even Fanny treated her in a much more friendly manner, since she had taken the, name of Graham'. In Mrs. Graham she found a judicious counSellor, and kind friend. Her in- experience in domestic duties required the fre- quent instruction of her who had so kindly volun- teered to point out and correct all deficiencies. "What, Marian, not dressed yet!" exclaimed Graham; "I feared I had kept you waiting." "If you will give me' your permission, I would prefer remaining at home." "Nonsense, how you talk; what on earth put such a thought in my little wife's head? Marian, you cannot be serious?" "Never was more serious, dear James; I cannot reconcile to my conscience the course of pleasure pursued since our marriage; this round of gayety accords ill with my profession. I wish I could in- duce you to relinquish the gay scenes of this even- ing, from which you anticipate so much pleasure, and accompany me to hear good 'Dr. -- on the immortality of the soul; I think you would be amply repaid for any sacrifice you might make, while listening to the eloquence which flows from his lips." "Now, Marian, only think how good I have be-   j       MMARIAJN WALLACE.      219 come; do  not accompany you, once every Sab- bath, to hear your favorite preacher? Why bore me to death about it during the week? I am dis- appointed at your disinclination to join my friends, and more particularly this evening; but if you persist in going, be sure you go in company with taunt, who, I understand, intends hearing the lec- ture. Fanny will be ly partner as usual; I have no particular desire to have her recognized as Mrs. Graham, at all times.. I wish you had a little more of her vivacity, however." James reluctantly left his wife to .enjoy what he heeart prompted; she sorrowfully saw him de. part to join the gay throng who spend their precious tinme-given by divine Providence, to prepale them- selves for becoming participators in the joys which are for evermore. Mrs. Graham forebore to men- tion the absence of James, to Marian, perceiving the unhappy expression of her countenance, which she doubted not, arose from  that cause. The preacher was more than usually eloquent; the im- portant subject which he had chosen, demanded all the powers of his mind. It was late when James returned from the scenes of revelry. Marian awaited his return with anxious solicitude. She had a foreboding of evil which his presence was not calculated to dissipate. Her heart   220     MARIAN  WALLACE. throbbed as she gazed upon his flushed countenance, -and observed his excited manner. Morning brought little peace to her troubled bosom. James slept later than usual, and breakfast was hurried through with scarcely a monosyllable. Marian was truly un- happy. James had treated her with the tenderest affection since their marriage. Any thing like cold- ness wounded her deeply; but ere the morning passed, she drank deeper of her cup of woe. During a morning call from one of her friends,  the question was earnestly put: "Why, Mrs. Gra- ham, do you permit your husband to flirt so un- mercifully with the handsome Mrs. Sydney?" "If Mrs. Sydney permits him, I am sure I ought to have no objectidn." There was a tone of sarcasm in Marian's voice as she uttered this sentence, which was not lost upon her listener. "I confess," said she, "you display more amiabil- ity than I could under the circumstances. I should  not like my husband to carry on a flirtation with such a fascinating creature. You have no idea how splendid they lookd4e; they were the admiration of the room; every one declared they seemed to be made for each other. How on earth, Mrs. Graham, has this intimacy originated?"  i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      221 Marian knew well, but did not care to enlighten her loquacious visitor. "Mrs. Graham, of course you have received an invitation, for Friday, from that lady? Do not fail to-be there, that you may decide for yourself the extent of their intimacy."  Gladly did Marian bid her visitor adieu. She was left to the communing of her own thoughts, by the cradle of her darling boy, who slept sweetly, unconscious of the tide of anguish which was cours- ing through the mind of his mother. Had she done her duty, thought she, to her husband, in absenting herself from his side, and leaving him alone in the hour of temptation? Had she made his home as happy as it was in her power? Did she return the warm affection which he daily lavished upon her? No! If he was weak in purpose, was it not her-- duty to sustain and strengthen him by her presence, when she knew the talismanic influence she pos- sessed? She had wed him from gratitude and re- spect, blended with admiration of the man. Was her heart inaccessible? Were its avenues closed against the father of her boy whom she idolized? Loving her boy with such idolatry, she knew she was capable of warm and lasting attachments. James attended moodily to the duties of his call- ing, ever and anon contrasting Marian with the   222     MARIAN WALLACE. fascinating Mrs. Sydney, from whom he received so many marks of preference. I shall be heartily glad," said he to himself, "when her husband returns; she will then be ob- liged to restrain the display of her preference for me. Had I any other but a mopish wife, all this might have been avoided; it would be useless to present her with the invitation; she would prefer the prayer-meeting as usual. I fear I made a grand mistake in accepting friendship for love. If I were not convinced her affections have never been be- stowed upon another, I should be the most miser- able of men. I have certainly nothing to complain of; she treats me with all the respect which I could require; my wishes are anticipated, lly wants are all attended to in the most quiet and orderly man- ner, but I want the love of her soul; one glance of it from her eyes would satisfy me; one glance, such as she so often bestows upon our boy. I sometimes almost feel jealous of the affection with which she regards him.  Right glad am I that the club claims me for this evening, else I should hav  pay my respects to my charmer. I thought Malman looked sad this morning when I left. I re- member now, she was sitting {lp at the late hour of my return-sorry for that. Marmaduke tempted me with that sparkling champagne; I fear I was   MARIAN WALLACE.       223 :l  not quite myself. I hope the club will break up at a seasonable hour, so that I may retain my wife's good opinion." Marian counted the 'hours of one and two- James had not made his appearance-fatigued in mind and body, she threw herself, dressed as she was, on the bed, from which she was aroused by the cry of her baby, disturbed by the noisy en- trance of his father. lIe was not in a condition to be expostulated with. She soothed her terrified child, and assisted her husband to his room. In the silent watches of that night, did she devise the plan of her future conduct. She resolved to save her husband at any cost, strength being per- mitted her from on high; she knew the influence she possessed, the power with which she swayed bi lhis every act. Was it noti therefore incumbent on her, she thought, to accede to his wishes and ac- company him more frequently. "' Yes," said she to herself, "the fear of man shall not deter me; the opinion of the world shall -I  not influence me in what I consider the path of duty-the endeavor to preserve my husband's honor untarnished.  He never touches the ruby cup- filled with desolation and woe to the widow and orphan--when my hand rests in his; is that not incentive sufficient? and should I fail in the effort,   224     MARIAN  WALLACE. I shall have the consolation of an approving con- science." Did those who are calculated to strengthen the erring, consider the influence their presence exerts in the hour of temptation; did the pious wife but' feel that the relinquishing of her own wishes fre- quently deterred her impenitent husband from committing the most flagrant sins, would he not necessarily be brought to admire more truly the Christian character? To be found more frequently by James's side, was Marian's determination. She set to work in order to prepare for the evening's entertainment, without mentioning the matter to him, in' order that she might discover whether it was pleasing or not. When James returned in the evening, he found Marian dressed. "Where are you going?" said he. "With you, dear James, to Mrs. Sydney's." He looked at her with astonishment. "You look surprised, my dear husband. Do you  not intend going" " "Why, yes, I came home for that purpose, but-" "But what?  "I confess I was not prepared to find you ready  to accompany me." "Confess you are sorry," she said, playfully. "Not to forego the pleasure will I make a false   MA'RIAN WALLACE.       225 accusation. But here you are standing lest you may rumple your finery, and be unable to look your best for the gratification of your husband, who must say he is very much pleased his little wife has crept from under her domestic shell, and per- mits herself to be recognized as his better half." While James was making himself presentable, Marian employed the interval in perusing a letter he had placed in her hand from her beloved aunty, which told of the departure of Miss Bankliead from Shirly Park, and her subsequent marriage to Mr. Carleton. She mentioned the frequent and anxious. letters she had received from Miss Harvey, since her departure; also' the satisfaction that lady ex- pressed when informed of her marriage. Frank had obtained leave of absence, and was now on a visit to the Park. I{e appeared less robust than when he joined the army. Caroline had apparently obtained the affections of her grandmother. Mr. Everet, the bearer of the letter, was the nephew of Miss Harvey. He was a young physician, who had received his diploma. Having made the tour of Europe, he now sought the shores of the New World; where a wider sphere of usefulness lay before him. "May his life be a useful and happy one," wrpte Miss Woolsey. "Receive him as the relative of your first best earthly friend, a consider- 10*   226     MARIAN  WALLACE. ation sufficient in itself, without my enunerating his good qualities. Hie has ever been an exem- plary son and affectionate brother. As a wife and mother, may you, my adored Marian, fill your posi- tion with fidelity. You are young to ;assume the responsibility of training an immortal mind, and ' fitting it for the joys of the upper world." On their way to Mrs. Sydney's, Marian inquired why James had not brought Mr. Everet home with him. She longed to welcome and extend the hos- pitalities of her house to one so nearly allied to 'Miss Harvey. James informed her that he had pressed him to spend an evening with his family; but he declined, on the plea of having to sail for Savannah the next morning. That, on his re- turn, he would gladly accept of his kindness. Marian had the satisfaction of seeing her husband leave the house of Mrs. Sydney with a clear head and steady hand. Not all the blandishments, of that lady had been able to tempt him to raise the poisoned chalice to his lips, in consequence of. which, she received less of his attention. Marian had been greatly annoyed during the evening; the haughty spirit of former years had swelled her bosom; the torrent of her passionate temper rushed to sweep away the embankment, and obtain freer course, as she had heard some remarks of that   MARIAN  WALLACE.      227 lady to one of her female friends, delivered, as she supposed, in privacy. It was a recapitulation of the scene in the boudoir, but descanted upon in a most libellous manner. -Iad she forgotten the essential service the hus- band of that traduced sempstress had performed- but for which she would have been stripped of her butterfly plumage, with which she floated so ethereally, the admired of all?-Had she forgotten that her husband had saved Mr. Sydney from in- evitable ruin, by the timely exertion of his influence with his friends? And for succor such as this, did she vilify the wife of him whom she called her friend and preserver. This, then, was the friend- ship which the world offers for the acceptance of the unwary.   228      MARIAN  WALLACE.  CHAPTER   XV. We met not till the azure Clouds of youth had fled, . And many'a requiem had been sung O'er hopes, alas! now dead. PERSEVERINGLY did Marian continue to shield and protect her husband by her presence, lest he might wander from the paths of rectitude; and often did she find herself listening to a severe reprimand from her friend and pastor, for joining so frequently in scenes of festivity, which were calculated to unfit the mind for the sober realities of religion, which maketh wise unto salvation.  Marian  could not explain why she was so frequently found in such scenes. The world knew not her husband's beset- ting sin-could she, his wife, cast the first stone. "Let them think, uinfavorably of me," said she to herself, "if needs be; have I not my reward in an approving conscience?"' None knew the extent of her trials-all believed her most happily situated. Some even envied the happiness she had the good   MARIAN  WALLACE.      229 fortune to obtain; but had the choice been offered her, gladly would she have returned to her humble calling. Never had, his wife uttered one reproach- ful word through all his delinquencies. He looked upon her as his guardian angel, from whom he was about to be separated for the first time since their mairiage, his business requiring his presence in a distant part of the state. Marian looked forward to this separation with inexpressible dread, for Mar- maduke was to be the companion of her husband during his temporary absence, and she feared his example, when away, might counteract the influ2 ence she held over him. It was impossible for her to accompany him, the delicate state of her baby's health demanding the care which none but a moth- er could bestow. She was compelled, therefore, to resign -her husband to the society of a dissolute young man. She could not even counsel her hus- band. His was a disposition that could not en- dure the appearance of being bound. Her power consisted in yielding to his will; and by so doing, she made him subservient to hers, without his feel- ing the mortification of owning her power. She could do nothing but commit him to the care of her heavenly Father. The evening before James's departure, Marian became deeply impressed with the fear, that they   230     MARIAN WALLACE. would never meet again a whole family, and was so much overcome by it, that she was obliged to leave the room for a time. James left with the joyful anticipation of a speedy reunion. Marian saw him depart; but the feeling of desolation as she saw the last wave of his hand, so overcame her, that her heart burst into an uncon- trollable fit of weeping. Fanny had come to make a visit in the absence of James, who left much better satisfied, now that Marian had a companion, who might relieve her of the care of the baby. Marian received letters regularly from her husband, faithfully detailing the progress of his business. He wrote, that he was looking forward anxiously for the time when he might resign it into the hands of others. He would be heartily glad, he wrote, if he could get a person to purchase his interest in the concern, which must SQ frequently separate him from his wife and darling boy. "I hope," he said, "Fanny is in one of her amiable moods; if she is, she will be an agreeable companion. Perhaps it will be better to divide the time of my absence with her mother, whom you both love and respect. Right glad was I to hear of the continued amend- ment in the health of the baby. I have no doubt I shall find him quite robust when I return. Take   MARIAN WALLACE.       231 particular care of your own precious health, is the strict injunction of the husband who adores you." Such was the purport of every epistle which reached Marian. Her husband's absence was, how- ever, protracted much more than she could see any necessity for; his letters came less frequently. How was she to account for this seeming neglect? prob- ably he had been called farther into the interior of the country, where "the mails are less punctual. Such is ever the excuse of a trusting heart, for ap- parent neglect-the mail is charged with the delin- quency. James had been from home more than thre  months; Marian daily expected his return. r Graham insisted on her spending some time with her, as Fanny wished to visit some friends in the country. Mrs. Graham overruled all Marian's ob- jections. It was finally arranged that she should accompany her on the morrow. Mrs. Graham re- mained to assist her with the baby, who had grown almost too heavy for her to manage. "Mrs. Graham, don't you think he is lovely in his night-dress? Just see how he kicks his little feet through the bars of the crib, and crows at the victory he has achieved," said his mother, who never tired of watching the gambols of her precious boy. Fond mother, look your last on that picture of loveliness. Never will that snowy foot peep again   232     MARIAN  WALLACE. through those bars. Ere to-morrow's sun sinks to rest, those tiny limbs will be still and cold, those cherry lips will emit no infantine laughter, the arrow of death will have pierced his pure and sin- less heart, angels are even now waiting to convey his angelic spirit through the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem, where his infant voice will swell the chorus of the Lanmb;-thrice happy babe, to drink so soon of the rivei of life. Dost thou not already gaze on the angelic vision?-thy lips are parted with a heavenly smile even in thy slumbers. Marian was startled by the sound of that most alarming disease, the croup. It fell like a death- knell upon her maternal heart. Medical aid was instantly summoned. Mrs. Graham did every thing that the emergency of the case demanded. When the medical practitioner arrived, he pronounced the little sufferer past recovery. "Doctor, must he die " were the first and only words uttered by that mother, whose very soul was centred in her dying child. '"My dear madam, I can hold out but slen- der hopes of his recovery; the issue is in the hands of a loving Father, who doth not willingly afflict." Well was it for that stricken mother that she had the kind and experienced Mrs. Graham to look to in that hour of trial, when her darling treasure was about to be snatched from her embrace. Para-   MARIAN WALLACE.        233 lyzed wit terror, she could do naught but gaze. She was carcely sensible when the good Shepherd had taken the lamb to his heavenly fold-that the heart of the mother might be drawn by a three- fold cord of love to that blessed fold where the treasure of her heart had entered ere sin had pol- luted its snowy innocence by actual transgression. Gently and lovingly they arranged those tiny limbs, which, but a few short hours before, danced in baby joyousness. The clods of the valley fell with a deep sepulchral sound on the ear of the mother, who refused to be comforted, because her child was not. Mrs. Graham wept with and for Marian, alone in her grief. She had written to James immediately after the baby had breathed his last, without any positive assurance that the letter would reach him; as in his last to hIis wife, he mentioned his return might be hourly expected. Iad he returned at the time appointed, Marian- would have had some earthly support in this terrible calamity. The letter brought him sooner than could have been expected. The nmeeting was affecting in the extreme. When the sorrowing mother gazed upon his countenance, she could scarcely recognize him as her husband. He was fearfully changed; the glow of health had receded, and a fearful pallor had supplied its place. k  .   '234     MARIAN  WALLACE. The hollow cough told that disease was making fast inroads in that once robust frame. This was no time to reproach or burden him with her sor- row. She must look into the recesses of ler own heart, and use every exertion for the restoration of her husband's health. When urged to consult a physician in his own case, his invariable answer was: "I am perfectly well, with the exception of a cold. It is nothing, I assure you, but a slight cold." It was, ala! a neglected one-the precursor of an event which must inevitably follow, if not attended to. Each succeeding week told the anxious friends, James had less strength than the week pre- vious; still he yielded not to the solicitations of his  friends, but 'pursued his arduous duties with the *same avidity as when enjoying perfect health., Fearfully did Marian look upon the wreck of that form, which it had been her pride to gaze upon. A residence in a warmer climate was proposed, and finally acceded to by the invalid; but the excite- ment of preparation for the journey, produced- hem- orrhage of the lungs, by which he was so muche prostrated as to be unable to travel, and never so far recovered as to be able to attend to business. Many weary months did Marian sustain and soothe her suffering husband. Daily did she' present her case to that God, who "doth not afflict His children   MAR!IAN WALLACE.       235 above what they are able to bear." Yet Marian felt the Lord's hand heavy upon her; her idol had been taken, and to all human appearance, her hus- band's days too were numbered. Was she again to be left alone? - Was every earthly prop to be removed? In the bitterness of her heart she cried to the Lord that this great evil might be averted. Forgetting the Saviour's declaration, that he "that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me," she dared to approach the throne of the Eternal with the selfish request, that the evil from which her heart shrank might be averted. Poor frail humanity, trembling beneath the chastise- ment of Him who so loved the children of men, as to give His well beloved Son, that whosoever be- lieved in Him might be saved. If He permitted the Son of His love to leave the throne of His glory, take upon Himself our human nature, suffer and die, that we through IIis suffering might be made per- fect, will He exempt us from death, who withheld not His only Son? Marian was long ere she could say, "  Though He slay me, yet will I trust Iim ;" but ere the sands of her husband's life were ran, she was enabled to say: "Not my. will, but thine be done." Faithfully did her pastor labor for the sal- vation of that soul, about to wing its flight to the untried regions beyond the grave.   236     MARIAN  WALLACE. Marmaduke returned in time to receive thQe dying injunction of James, to turn from the error of his way, ere the bed of death found him unprepared. "Marmaduke, my dear fellow, it is hard to leave this world, with the sins of our past life staring us in the face unrepented of; it is hard when racked with pain, to give that attention which the urgency of the case demands. What deluded creatures we are, to allow the allurements of the world to draw our thoughts from the eternal welfare of. our souls, which must live forever in the enjoyment of eter- nal happiness, or unutterable woe. Oh! Marma- duke, in how many scenes of revelry have we been participators!--in how many acts where sin was the immediate consequence, have we incited each other to its commission! Now, as I stand upon the threshold of the grave, let me entreat you, not to put far from you the evil day, for it may come as a thief in the night." "Well, now, Graham, what is the use of distress- ing yourself so? You and I have not been the most grievous sinners. To hear you talk one would think our lives had been one continued course, of crime; so flagrant, that it was utterly impossible to receive pardon. Now I don't believe that God intends to punish us after we leave this world." "Marmaduke, you may lull your conscience by   I      ]IMARIIAN WALLACE.      237 trying to believe sjch to be the case, while in per- feet health, but elieve me, such sentiments soften not the dying pillow.   The Scriptures say, 'As the tree falls, so it must lie, until the morn when the archangel's trump awakes the dead to receive the reward for the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or bad.'  Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids, for as you live, so sure will you be judged. I have held the be- lief for many years that morality was all-sufficient to insure me eternal joys; entered into all the pleasures which our human nature is constituted to enjoy, maintained a fair exterior, owing no man any thing. Until I became acquainted with you, never hald I touched the wine-cup. Am I prepared to stand before that God, against whom every act of my life has been in open rebellion? Take this admonition kindly, from one who is standing upon the confines of the grave!" Marmaduke was rather disposed to resent the personality of his friend's warning advice, until he looked upon the wan face of the speaker, who, but a few months before, he had urged to turn his feet to the saloons, and from thence to the gaming- table. Yes, it was all his work, but lie never, for a moment, weighed the consequences. What were the consequences? Widowhood t(o the wife of his   238  1:  MARIAN WALLACE. friend, and she childless. 'Oh ye votaries of pleas- ure, could you behold those widowed ones lhom, perhaps, your example has caused to become such, would 'you not start with alarm at such a sightt would you not forego the gratification of a night spent in dissipation? Mr. and Mrs. Sydney called frequently during the protracted illness of James. Marian felt disposed to accept their aid, which they urgently offered; her grateful heart acknowledged any kindness displayed towards her husband, but she felt obliged to decline their services, as the tenor of their conversation was worldly, which ill fitted them for attendance on the dying sufferer. It was a sultry day in August, and, from the per- fect stillness of the air, very oppressive to the invalid, who was rapidly passing away; he had sunk into a short and unrefreshing slumber, his hand resting in that of his wife; he awoke much exhausted. "Miarian," said he, "I feel much, very much weak- er; you will not leave me to-day, will you? There is. much I should like to say'if my strength will permit. What will you do when I am gone? so young and unprotected. You love my aunt; if you think you could be comfortable, I should like you to return and reside in the home I took you fromn." "James, all you wish I will do, only rest." "But the tine is so short in which to make all iz oo ohort in whiel e al   MARIAN  WALLACE.       239 necessary arrangements, and my strength so inade- quate. I have no doubt Marmaduke will do every thing which is honorable in relation to our finan- cial concerns, but I should like to have stated the position in which we stood to 'my wife. Perhaps I shall feel better able to-mrorrow. I hope I have been as careful of your worldly comfort as you have been for my eternal happiness. How much more-peaceful is this dying bed, through your in- strumentality." He became entirely exhausted, and, on recovery, in the feeblest accents, begged her to senld for the Reverend Dr. ---, his aunt, and Fanny.  The entrance of Marmaduke caused a smile to illumine the sufferer's face, he took -lis hand affectionately. "RIemember the truths I have tried to impress on your mind," th;e sentence fal- tered on his dying lips. "I shall soon be at rest, yes, at rest." His mind seemed to wander, for his next words were, "'Marian, don't leave me." HHe raised his feeble hand to his brow, cold with the dew of death, passed it slowly across that brow which never wore a frown. "Marian, can this be death l" lIe read the truth in the agonized coun- tenance of her he loved so fondly. "Yes, this is death; but I trust the Lord-Deathll!-Ie died that I might live." The fountain of Marian's tears had ceased to flow. Pale and statue-like she gazed ji   240     MARIAN WALLACE.  on her husband, as he followed their reverend friend in his prayer, with his lips. They ceased to move; she thought the spirit had fled. Nature could hold  out no longer-she fainted. Gently they attempted to move her, when he again opened his eyes, almost closed in death, laid his hand on the insensible head of his wife, and with a look of entreaty that could not be resisted. Thus did his spirit pass away. After a short prayer, offered up at the bed of death for her who was now  bereft, Mrs. Graham, Fanny, Captain MacPherson, /n  aduke, and Mr. Francis rose from their knees; they bore the stricken wife from the room. Marmaduke and Francis wended their way to announce the sad intelligence to that com- pany of which he and they were members. The intelligence spread the deepest gloom. among the number, as he had shared largely in their affec- tions. They evinced their respect for his memory by the attention and. kindness they bestowed on his sorrowing wife. Marian had neither wept nor slept since the death of her husband. The time had arrived when they were to convey him to his last resting-place. Mechanically she attended to the wishes of her friends, entirely unconscious of what was required. Pale and spectre-like she followed his beloved remains, leaning on the arm of Captain   MARIAN  WALLACE.      241 MacPherson, through,the ranks of his associates. Every head was uncovered when they passed; many a tear coursed down their manly cheeks as they watched that lonely one following her all to the grave. She stood alone in her grief, no brother's arm supported her trembling form, no sister's sooth- ing voice spoke words of consolation in her widowed ear; bereft of all, she gazed on the open sepulchre and longed to lie down with him for whom  it was prepared. There was one in that throng who pledged himself to be a brother th the lonely one. Death had recently bereft him of a dear and only sister, her place he resolved to supply with the widowed orphan. Iow, and in what way he ful- filled that pledge, we shall leave it to time to show. After the funeral, Mrs. Graham took Marian to her home, entirely unconscious that James had re- quested Marian to make choice of it as her future abode. We will leave Marian here, and revert to the quiet village where Flora is still residing. Fre- quently was that muffled figure which had borne them company on the stage-coach, seen hovering around the hu1mble parsonage where Flora resided. Regular was his attendance at the village church on Sabbath morning; his appearance had excited in Mr. Barlow a desire to know more of the stranger " ,:   242     MARIAN WALLACE. who scrutinized him so closely. Possibly, thought he, he is an unhappy son of pleasure who has fled its allurements with a conscience ill at ease, and sought our quiet village, that his mind may be re- lieved by silent meditation. If such be the case, ought I not to give him an opportunity to form an acquaintance which I sometimes think he feels dis- posed to seek. Flora's health improved but slowly after the death of her father, and it was long before she could in- hale the perfume of'the flowers, whose variegated hues added beauty to the rural dwelling where this happy family resided. The quiet and unobtrusive kindness of Mrs. Barlow won the heart of the hum- ble and penitent Flora, whom both her husband and herself regarded with pitying compassion, and whose grief they sought to alleviate, by excursions, as fre- quently as her health permitted. When she was able to join their rambles, they dfew around her the best society their village afforded. Gladly would Flora have avoided being present on these occasions, and frequently would the blush of shame mantle her pale but still beautiful cheek, when introduced to the notice of strangers.   J      1KMARIAN WALLACE.      243 i CHAPTER  XVI. "remembrance, Why dost thou open all my wounds again?!' "EE'S TnEODOSIUS. FLORA and Mrs. Barlow were seated one after- noon in the summer-house, which had been recently erected in the exquisitely arranged garden; the children were culling flowers from the diamond and crescent beds, which were laid out with mosaic pre. cision. A miniature lake had been introduced from a neighboring river, whose quiet waters turned many a mill in the vicinity. 'rs. Barlow and Flora were interrupted in an earnest conversation by the appearance of Mr. Barlow, who apologized tor intruding on their rural privacy; but he had he said, just formed the acquaintance of a gentle- man, a stranger, in whose appearance he had for some time been interested. Fortune, in a propi- tious moment had thrown them together, which had necessarily resulted in an acquaintance, and he had invited the stranger to tea. "Come, my dear wife,   244     MARIAN WALLACE. that I may present you. I think you will find him an agreeable addition to our'circle. Flora, shall I have the pleasure of presenting you at the same time? or will you defer it until you join us at the tea-table?" "I thank you, Mr. Barlow, I will remain here, the air is so balmy; besides, I have not yet admired sufficiently the scenery from this point. Only think how much' time you must have spent in erecting, with your own hands, this pleasant shelter, where we can sit and view the beauties of the surrounding landscape." The leisure moments of Mr. Barlow were spent in adorning and beautifying this rural spot. His gar- den was in a high state of cultivation. Choice plants and shrubbery had been presented to him by the good old gardener of the Hall, the seat of the nobleman who held the living in his gift. Flora reluctantly left the beauties of nature on which she gazed with such entranced admiration, to join the family, who were waiting her appearance. So en- tirely had her thoughts been engrossed, that the presence of the stranger was forgotten, until she discovered him in earnest conversation with, Mr. Barlow, who immediately turned to introduce him. What was her consternation when she discovered in the person of the stranger, him for whom she ,         I    .     ]MARIAN  WALLACE.      245 had become an outcast from her father's hearth, :  lost the blessing of his dying lips, breathed in her afflicted ear; had her children torn from her pa- rental embrace, and caused that mother 'whom she regarded with respectful adoration, to blush at the mention of her daughter's name  There he stood, I  the being for whom she had sacrificed every earthly consideration.  Hler heart refused to pulsate at the unexpected apparition. She sank upon the floor ere assistance could be rendered. When recovered, she found Mrs. Barlow seated by her bed, looking anx- ious and alarmed. On her attempting to speak, Mrs. Barlow motioned her to silence, which re- mained uninterrupted, until the arrival of the ply- sician, who carefully and faithfully inquired the symptoms of his patient, and vhat was supposed to have produced this effect. Mrs. Barlow attrib- uted it to the fatigue of walking, blaming herself for not insisting on Flora's return with her. My dear Mrs. Barlow," said the physician, "to your careful nursing will I resign my patient, with the strict injunction, that she be kept quiet. Administer this anodyne according to directions. I have no doubt, if she adheres faithfully to my advice, I shall be able to pronounce her convalescent in a few days. The principal thing to be avoided is excitement, so that her mind remains undisturbed."   246     MARIAN. WALLACE. The reflections of Flora were painful and humil- iating. Why. had Bristow intruded himself? Why had he sought to humble her still more in the eyes of the world? Was. there to be no alleviation to her sufferings? When Mr. Barlow  became ac- quainted with the circumstances, could he consist- ently allow her to become an inmate of his family? Her good friend, the doctor, prescribed quiet; but the Scripture declareth that "there is no peace to the wicked." Was not her heart like the troubled sea, casting up mire and dirt. How fearfully were those words verified, "TTly sins shall find thee out." The heavy forebodings which filled her mind, pre- vented that speedy restoration to health which the doctor had predicted. The tranquillity which per- vaded the sick room had not the effect of tranquil- izing a sin-sick soul. Carefully had she labored to uproot the affection she had entertained for Bris- tow, and her efforts had, in a great measure, been successful. His unexpected appearance had, how- ever, rent the covering of her heart, and discovered the fire of love still smouldering there, ready to burst into a volcanic flame. Much did she need divine assistance to overcome the intensity of a pas- sion which had brought on herself ruin and deso- lation; humiliation to her family and friends. She resolved to explain every thing to Mr. Barlow, and   MARIAN WALLACE.       247 be guided by his counsel. Flora was spared this mortification. Bristow had unbosomed his sorrows to her friend. The sight of her wan and wasted figure had affected him deeply; but the excitement of his feelings yielded for a time to the reasonings of Mr. Barlow, who persuaded him to reflect on the proposition he was about to make, and for which he had lingered so long in the vicinity of her dwell- ing. "Let me but see her, Mr. Barlow, let me but plead my cause. They tore her from me ere I could bid her a fond adieu; and surrounded her with vigilant keepers, well worthy of the trust reposed in them." "It is utterly impossible," said Mr. Barlow, "for me to comply with your wishes. Flora has been intrusted to my care by the desire of her parents; it was their wish that I should perform the part of guardian to her, whom they could not, for un- explained reasons, choose to receive as an inmate of their family. A liberal sum was placed at my disposal, in order that I might defray all necessary expenses, but with strict injunctions to guard her from any ahnoyance, either personal or by letter, from which I inferred that some difficulty existed between their daughter and her husband." "Allow me, Mr. Barlow," said Bristow, "to make to her the only reparation in my power."   248     MARIAN  WALLACE. "From what I know of Flora since she has been a member of my family," replied Mr. Barlow, "I am convinced you would be adding insult to sin sincerely repented of. She feels the obligation of the law none the less binding, though the law may have freed her erring husband from the responsi- bilities he assumed at the altar." "Will you then, Mr. Barlow, be the bearer of a letter to Flora from me, in which I will pour out the feelings of my heart?" "Not without the approbation of that lady her- self.' I will, however, see her, and, touching as lightly as possible on this unfortunate circumstance, endeavor to discover her sentiments, and make them known to you on the next opportunity." Mr. Barlow felt the responsibility of the position Providence liad assigned him in this matter. It was some time befoie he had an opportunity of conversing with Flora, who was still weak. When it offered, he spoke as a servant of the Most High, whose ambassador he was.' Faithfully did he en- deavor to lead the erring one to lay her sins at the' foot of the cross. "The blood of a crucified Saviour was," he said, "still as efficacious in cleans- ing from all pollution, as when it oozed from his wounded side on Calvary's rugged steep." Flora listened With deep attention to the en-   :         MARIAN WALLACE.     "  249 treaties of her friend to give her heart unreservedly to Him who never turns any empty away. "Mr. ' Barlow," said Flora, "must I leave your peaceful home, with the mark of Cain upon my forehead? must I be a fugitive on the earth? must the doors of humanity be closed against me? Speak, my friend, and let me hear my doom." Mr. Barlow was deeply affected. "Flora," said he, "had I known all the circumstances connected with your sad history, I should have hesitated before receiving you, much as I honored and revered your father, and heavy as were my obligations to him. I received you in ignorance of the crime you had committed, learned to love you, and if ever pity found a worthy object, I believe mine has. Flora, I will never turn my back upon you, knowing that in many things I have myself erred, and strayed from the precept of the Lord, and am consequently unfit to cast the first stone. Rest assured, my erring child, you will have my protection, poor as it is, until you are claimed by your family." Mr. Barlow thought it best for Flora's future happiness that she should remain ignorant of Bris- tow's wish to make her his wife, which he could not lawfully do. His Christian patience never was more severely tested than in his labor of love with Bristow, whom he found irritable and inclined to "*   250     MAKIAN  WALLACE. dispute the authority he had assumed in relation  to Flora. "iRemember," said Mr., Barlow, "that  she has no father, that she is forsaken by her only  surviving parent, and alienated from the hearts of all with whom she claims affinity. Were I to   f withdraw my protection, what would she become2"'  "What but my wife i? "And in becoming your wife, to what would she be subjected? Now, for her amiable qualities she is beloved, then she would be an object of scorn and lerision. Mention not the subject again, lest I in-  lict the necessary punishment your words demand." Bristow left Mr. Barlow with feelings of ani-  nosity almost amounting to hatred, and vowing to rain admittance to Flora, though she were guarded Iver so securely. "From her own lips," said he,  'will I hear the sentence which fixes my fate. To  [ome sequestered spot in sunny Italy will I bear her.  Hy life shall be devoted to her future happiness."  When the death of Marian's husband was an-  aounced to the lady of Shirly Park, she immediately 3ent for her able and efficient counsellor Carleton, who hastened to obey the arbitrary command.  Galling was the yoke by which he was enthralled,  fllied, as he was, through her instrumentality, to- a  woman he detested. When ushered into the pres-  i nace of his patroness, he saw on her brow a gather- 'It   ing storm. "Why so tardy of late, Carleton?" said Mrs. Leslie. "Methinks you weary of the shackles which bind our interests together." "Lady, I hastened on the first intimation of your pleasure, and now await your commands," said- Carleton. "You have, undoubtedly, heard of the death of Marian's husband, and the plans of Miss Woolsey." "No, madam; I now hear it for the first time." "Nothing less will satisfy Miss Woolsey than Marian's return. This plan must be frustrated; and 'or that purpose I have summoned, you. That ami- able partner of yours must sound the antiquated lame, and ascertain whether she has sent the dis- )atch announcing her wishes; if so, you must write o the girl in such a way as to preclude a possi- ility of her return. You know her haughty spirit; must be humbled. If the letter is still unsent, ou must manage to intercept it. On the shores f her native land she must never set ier foot 7hile I live; not for worlds would I have her and rank meet in the first years of her widowhood, ow when his sympathies are so aroused in her ehalf. I very much fear his boyish feeling for or will continue through life, and probably thwart ly views I may have for his aggrandizement. By e way, Stanhope has written, requesting Caroline's                  .    immediate presence at L---, in order, I suppose, to bid her farewell before he leaves for Egypt,  where lie is to remain for an indefinite period.  It would be scarcely reasonable to deny hinm lhe gratification of bidding her farewell. Knowing how impossible it would be for me to brook his presence, he has no alternative but to demand hers, which, however, I am loth to gratify; but, having no plails- ible excuse, and being herself anxious to go, I sup pose I shall be obliged to yield."  We will now leave Shirly Park and its amiable lady, and look in upon Eglantine Cottage. The  "antiquated dame"-as Mrs. Leslie politely termed  Miss Woolsey-was looking older than might have  j been expected. Time had traced deeper furrows on  her venerable but still lovely countenance, than when  last introduced to the reader. The same benevo- lent expression beamed from her mild and loving ' eye, as when she first pressed that lone orphan to her bosom, whose sorrows she desired to soothe,  whose griefs she was willing to share. Had her  age permitted, she would willingly have undertaken I the voyage, that Marian might the more readily  be persuaded to yield to one who loved her so   i fondly, and who had given every possible proof of her affection during her sojourn in a foreign land. "She surely cannot," said Miss Woolsey to    herself, "let tthe petulance with which I penned some of the first epistles after her departure, hlave any weight in influencing her in continuing to reside permanently abroad. How early has she been inured to sorrow! The morning of her days has ever been shrouded in the night of grief. Will ever the horizon of her existence be cleared? May the God of the covenant protect and bless her. May the trials which, in His divine Providence, He has appointed, be the means of winning her soul from a world of sin and sorrow-fixing her mind on the celestial joys of the upper world, where the redeemed of the Lord lay their blood-washed crowns at his feet." While contemplating the possibility of meeting with her beloved child in this life, her reverie was disturbed by a visit from Mrs. Carleton, who mani- fested much apparent gratification at being able to pay her friend the long-promised visit. She had come, she said, to spend a (Jay in the society of one who always had such good counsels to im- part, that it was a privilege to be permitted to hear the words that fell from her lips. Such was this wily woman, who was willing to sacrifice her principles at the shJrine of Mamnon. Frequently, like Felix, had she trembled, while listening to the entreaties of Miss Woolsey to become a Christian,   254     MARIAN WALLACE. and while hearing from her warning voice the declaration that the Spirit of the Lord shall not always strive. Often on these occasions had she been induced to acknowledge how greatly she had sinned, but the possibility of losing some of the good things of this life, with which she was sup- plied from Shirly Park, would so enfeeble her resolution as to make her unable to obey the whis- perings of conscience. Among a group of fashionables collected in Mrs. Sydney's boudoir were to be found Fanny, Marma- duke, and Louisa Gamble, his sister. -Louisa might  be termed a handsome girl, amiable in disposition, ! gentle and lady-like in manner-characteristics which she inherited from her mother, who was a woman of superior mind, but who, like many others, had  allowed her affections to betray her into marrying I a man every way her inferior. Possessed of ample wealth, she, with a woman's trusting spirit, resigned it to her husband's keeping, who, finding the heavy  responsibility it involved, determined to rid him-  self of it as speedily as possible, and entered into  &every fashionable frivolity with a zest which, in a much shorter time than he anticipated, relieved  him of the intolerable burden, to the great detri- : ment of his family, who, by his prodigality, were obliged to seek a home in the New World, where i -   MARIAN  WALLACE.    .  255 they could live on the remnant of their scattered fortune, without experiencing themortifications they were daily subjected to in their own land. Mrs. Gamble's maternal heart was gladdened by tie loving excellence of her daughter. For Mar- maduke many were the tears she shed in secret. He sought the path which his father had frequented, where he met kindred spirits, to whom he was ever a welcome associate. His pleasing exterior was a sure guarantee of admission to the society of our gay and fashionable belles, who pay very little regard to the moral character of a man, pro- vided he be presentable. "Fanny, have you ever thought of the attention Marmhaduke pays to the widow of our late friend Graham?" drawled the fashionable Mrs. Sydney. ' "My attentions are like your own, my dear nadam, selfish, purely selfish," exclaimed Marina- duke. "I thank you for your very polite and pointed remark, Mr. Gamble. I think we could not do better than send a vote of thanks to your amiable monitress, Mrs. Graham, for the proficiency which her pupil has made. You certainly coincide with me, Fanny? "I most assuredly do; and also propose that a   256 tMAIUAN      WALLACE. medal be struck, bearing the inscription, 'To Ma- rian, for amiability."' "A truce to your nonsense, ladies." "Now, seriously, Marmaduke, I see you are in- clined to protect that prodigy. Be careful how you approach; if you once arouse tTat piece of amiability you will find some difficulty in appeas- ing her. I had a fine specimen of her good qual- ities when she was my sempstress." "Your sempstress, Mrs. Sydney!" "Yes, my sempstress. I employed her until I could not tolerate her impertinence any longer. I  had hoped to make something of her, but my hus-  band was so disgusted with her pride, and I sym- E pathized so with her poverty, that I still continued  to employ her, until an opportunity ofered where  I could recommend her for her capability, very ! much relieved that I was not questioned in relation  to her disposition. Such is the amiable Mrs. Gra-  ham, whom you intend escorting to the soiree." t.   MARIAN   WALLACE.        257 CHAPTER XVII. "Learn to dissemble wrongs, to smile at injuries, And suffer crimes thou want'st the power to punish; Be easy, affable, familiar, friendly: Search, and know all mankind's mysterious ways, But trust the secret of thy heart to none; This is the way, This only, to be safe in such a world as this is." ROWE'S ULYSSES. WHEN   Marmaduke, with his sister, left the house of their friend, he dwelt upon the information he had received.  If Marian had been so poor as was represented, there was no necessity for his being so very minute in his calculation.  James Graham had married and supported her handsomely.     She knew naught of the privation which those do who have been reared in luxury, and deprived of enjoy- ments which they have been accustomed to from their earliest infancy.   I shall give her a few hundreds, with a promise of a settlement, which I shall leave to my leisure to fulfil." When the amiable Mrs. Sydney and the interest- ing MAiss Graham   were alone, the conversation re-   258     MARIAN  WALLACE. specting Marian was resumed. "How that poor, ignorant, unfriended creature," said Mrs. Sydney, "has worked her way into the affection and in- terest of some of our friends is truly astonishing. I should not be surprised if she had some terrible downfall." "Don't breathe it," replied Fanny; " but I should be exceedingly glad of an opportunity to lower her in the estimation of my mother; who thinks her infallible. I have never forgiven her the winning of James's affections, and the final assumption of our name, which makes it necessary that I should treat her with courtesy." We will leave this interesting pair to their cogi- tations, and look in upon Marian, over whose head the first dark thunder-cloud of grief had passed. Still there was a blank, a sad blank, which ever and anon met her fond, inquiring eye. Two years had passed since the loved ones had been torn from her sight, still that void in her heart was un- filled. Yet hers was a sorrow not without hope; human affection and sympathies are strong, but time heals the wound which the archer, death, makes. Though her sorrow was subdued, to all appearance, she was as unwilling to join her friends as in the first days of her grief. She felt unusually sad, for Fanny had been urging her to accompany i .   MARIAN WALLACE.       259  herself and friend to a fashionable soiree before she left home that morning, which had been seconded by her mother, who thought it no merit in young persons immuring themselves in solitude. She had no desire to appear singular; nor did she wish her friends should think otherwise of her than she de- served; yet the thought of appearing alone and unprotected among them saddened her heart. Gay- ety accorded but ill with her feelings. "Now, Marian, there is no excuse you can frame," exclaimed Fanny, as she untied her bon- net, and drew close to the place where Marian was seated. "I have engaged Marmaduke as your es- cort for this evening. Not a word; you know it is perfectly proper under the circumstances,--he and James associated so much together." "But, Fanny, you know I particularly dislike him." "'Like him or not, there is no alternative; he will be here at the appointed hour." "Fanny, I think it is very unkind to make any such arrangement without my concurrence; I shall be under the necessity of irequesting you to apolo- gize for my not appearing.' "Mother, did you ever hear any thing so ridicu- lous as Marian's refusing to go with us this even- ing, after my taking so much pains to engage   260     MARIAN WALLACE.  Marmaduke as her escort? One would think she  was afraid to take her place in society, lest some  unforeseen circumstance should hurl her from the  false position which she nbw occupies."- "Fanny, my daughter, have you so far forgotten yourself, as to insult the wife of our beloved and  lamented James in our own house?  Go to your   ! room, my daughter."  How. Marian's heart swelled with indignation;  she who had been the petted child of fortune, en- joying every luxury wealth could bestow, to be  told by one whom she considered her inferior in  every way, that she was unable to deport herself  consistently with her circumstances-the pride of her nature was roused. Mrs. Graham saw how deeply Marian was wounded, and exerted herself to soothe her excited feelings; gently she remon- strated with her, for allowing a hasty word to  overthrow her equanimity. "I. had hoped," said she, "you had learned to  govern the impetuosity of your temper. Fanny   : neans well, though she is rather hasty in express-  ing her opinions, which are not always the most ? correct; forgive her for my sake, let us ever re- main a united and happy family; let the bond of union be sealed by your ready acquiescence in lmy wish, that you will accompany them this evening."'  ell,                     t   Jk1 . LIX 1 I A  AJ W U V  a'J iD -. U. 1L. Marian felt the chain by which she was enthralled; hr love for Mrs. Graham induced her to submit, though it frequently was grievous to bear with Fanny; there were times when she felt it almost necessary to seek a more congenial residence. Ma- rian did go, but not in company with Fanny or her party; her friend, Mr. Francis, waited upon her, where she met Capt. iacPherson, who in- formed her, that Mrs. Campbell and her daughters were somewhere in the assembly, under the escort of Mr. Everet. Marian was glad to meet her kind old friend the captain, and also of having another opportunity of enjoying the society of Mrs. Camp- bell and her daughters, of whom he went in quest, to bring them to his "little lass," as he still call- ed her. The gallant old tar was not long in dis- covering the ladies he was in search of, whom he led exultingly to where Marian and Mr. Francis were seated, followed by a gentleman of very pre- possessing appearance, to whom Marian was a stranger; she had lost the last part of the cap- tain's sentence, by the performance of the prelude When he was presented to her as Doctor Everet, her heart bounded with joy; could he be the friend of Miss Harvey? the bare possibility height- ened the glow on her cleok, which wounded pride had tinged with a deeper hue than naturally rest- ,;.   262     MARIAN  WALLACE.          4 ed there; there was indignation flashing in her /{ eyes, which were never averted from the face of 'l those' with whom she conversed; her sable dress .  heightened, rather than diminished, the interest of her appearance; she had never, perhaps, appeared  to more advantage than at that moment. There  was no opportunity of satisfying her curiosity dur- ing the performance. Doctor Everet took the first I opportunity, when there was a palse, to inquire  of Captain MacPherson, whether lie rightly under- stood him, that her name was Graham, and whether she was not the wife of James Gralham, to whom lie  had brought a letter of introduction on his arrival.  "The same, my dear fellow," said the captain.  "\For whom is she wearing those sable weeds?" "For her husband."  "Can it be possible? When I saw him last, lie  looked the very representation of health. Do you  think she is aware who I am " "I rather think not; hers is a nature to wel-  come her friends with the true warmth of an Irish  heart; foreign manners have not chilled its fervid 0 glow." "If you think she is uninformed of my return,    I shall thank you to present me again.*"  "That I will, with all my heart; a right good  lass she is, though she carried somewhat too high ; i';   a top-gallant in the calm of prosperity; when ad- versity came, like a sudden and unexpected squall, and threatened to shiver the shrouds, pride, like a pennant, floated amid the storm; pride sustained her when severed from  home and fiiends; never have I seen her humbled; perfectly capable of rising above every calamity, unslhrininngly pursuing the path marked out, such have I found her as a child, such does she still continue as a Woman." Everet pondered on the character drawn of Mrs. Graham, by the captain; unhesitatingly he requested another introduction, which was readily acceded to by their mutual friend. "Marian, allow me to present the nephew of your friend Miss Harvey." We will try to describe Doctor Everet, as he appeared when first presented to Marian. He was tall and slightly formed, with hair of a raven hue; with a complexion that might vie with any blonde, features fine and regular, though not handsome; in manners gentle and persuasive, dignified witlh- out haughtiness. Firmness was written on his com- pressed lip, integrity beamed from his deep-seated eye. Sentiments, of gratitude swelled the heart of Marian at an opportunity of becoming acquainted with a relative of her mnuch-respected and revered    '264     MARIAN  WALLACE. friend Miss Harvey. The interview was short but highly satisfactory. Deeply did Marian feel the loss she had sustained, at this moment, in the loss of her husband. Her generous heart would have prompted her to offer him the hospitalities of her home, but, alas, she had Ino home. Their acquaint- ance must be limited to the periodical calls of good breeding. "Fanny, do look at the group Marian has col- lected around her diminutive person. Who, upon the face of the earth, can it be bending down to hear the words that fall from that oracle of your mother's " "I thought she could not be prevailed upon to appear in such a crowd. Oh, but I thought her opinion would alter materially Wen opportunity offered! One of them is that ridiculous old sea captain, in whose society I am so frequently mor- N tified by the familiarity of his manners; presum-  ing upon the connection of our family with Ma- rian, he thinks he is authorized to say all manner i of disagreeable things; the other is Mr. Francis,  under whose protection she felt such perfect con-  fidence-delightfully romantic to be considered by y 1 him as his adopted sister. 'It is perfectly ridicu- j lous to hear him extol the heroic fortitude with  which she sustained herself; for my part, I con- i4   MARIAN WALLACE.       265 sider it proof sufficient of the indifence she felt; who but a stoic could have seen a husband who -. a husband who had raised her to a position in which she enjoyed all the comforts and pleasure-s of this life, consigned to the clods of the valley, without one tear? None but one void of feeling could have done this." Fanny did not care to recapitulate tilhe taunting language used to induce her to appear in public. "Marmaduke, who may that gentleman be who is conversing with Marian.?" "That is Doctor Everet, a young physician of some eminence, at least considered so. I have not the pleasure of being acquainted with him, but intend becoming so through your friend, with whom he appears to be on very friendly terms." It seemed to afford Marmaduke unspeakable pleasure to have an opportunity to emphasize the word friend when speaking of Mrs. Graham, "But, ladies, I see they are leaving the room. If we do not hasten, we shall lose the opportunity of a presentation." "For which we shall not be indebted to he;" exclaimed both the ladies. "Well, we shall not detain you, Mr. Gamble, against your wishes. I see Roland, who, I know  will most happily wait upon us." "Mrs. Sydney, you are provokingly fascinating. Think you would forego the pleasure of seeing   II 266    MARIAN WALLACE. C you safe forall the Doctor Everets in the world,  knowing how soon I must resign my place at youri side, to one who has the right to command the withdrawal of your favors towards your humble servant?" "Hush such ridiculous nonsense, Marmaduke, lest I voluntarily relinquish my attention before it be- comes necessary."                 Fanny was indebted to Marian for the oppor- tunity of becoming acquainted with Doctor Everet, mnch as she appeared to despise this mode of pre- sentation; she found him an agreeable addition to her numerous circle of friends, and determined to f level against him all the artillery of her fascinatiolls. Marian's mind was very nuc disquieted by the want& of punctuality on the part of her friends in answering her letters. She feared the health of her beloved aunty had become more feeble, fo nothing, she knew, but serious indispositiol would prevent a regular correspondence being maintain- ed. She was not sorry when her friend, Captain MacPherson, announced that his vessel was ready to sail, that her mind might be the sooner relieved from the depression under which she was laboring, though sorry to part with her friend, for gladly did she hail his transient visits to her adopted home. Before his departure, he insisted upon Marian's   MARIAN  WALLACE.      267 inviting her friends to partake of a collation on board his vessel. Fanny declared the proposition enchanting. ' It would gratify me above all things," she said, taking the compliment entirely to herself. "I shall invite Mr. and Mrs. Sydney, Marmaduke and sister, and, though last, not least, Doctor Everet." The good-natured captain smiled at the self-com- placency with which she extended her invitations. "Have you no corner in your memory," said he, for Marian, Miss Graham .?" "Oh, she is so very fastidious about where she goes, and with whom, that it is not at all times I dare make the proposition. If Mrs. Marian Gra- ham will do me the favor of accepting your very kind invitation, I shall feel myself under heavy ob- ligations to the lady, but I should as soon think of mother's accompanying us." "And is it so impossible to prevail upon your mother to participate in our enjoyment. Nothing would please me more than to havie her preside and do the honors; besides, she will be company for Marian, who I suppose you consider entirely too' antiquated to join in our juvenile sports." "Thank you, captain, for your suggestion that mother should accompnany us. You may rely upon I my exerting myself to the utmost, in order that she I may be induced to do' the honors of your table."   268     MARIAN WALLACE. What Fanny considered of sufficient importance to interest herself, we may rest assured was done satisfactorily. If Captain MacPherson had known how interested her motives were, he could not have repressed a smile. Marian's time and attention would be devoted to her mother, she would then have young Everet's exclusive attention, which she considered well worth using a little stratagem to obtain. Doctor Everet was too well bred to evince any displeasure at the disposition which had been made of his person by Fanny's management. With his clear discernment of human character, Marian felt sorry that Everet had not been chosen an at- tendant on the amiable Louisa, who, from her sweetness of manner, and intelligence of mind, he would have found an agreeable companion. Mrs. Sydney was all smiles, her husband all attention. She feared the world was not dealing as well with  him as formerly. The silvery threads of age were f thickening; care, with all its deep tracery, was shadowing his brow; thoughtfully would he gaze  upon his pretty wife, then turn to brush away the i starting tear; probably he had [been induced to  involve himself again in speculation, if so, how  would he ever be able to extricate himself? Their party were not the only persons present; there r were a few valued friends of the captain, among  , y   I      "MARIAN WALLACE.      269 whom was Mrs. Campbell, with 'her two daughters opportunity' offered of enjoying the society of that lady, to whom she ielt under many obliga- tions. She was still the same kind-hearted and thoughtful friend of former years, who had opened a way ito enable Marian to maintain herself by her own industry. They had to bid a hurried farewell to their pleas. ant entertainer, as the wind was favorable for the departure of the vessel. Marian again entreated him to wnte immediately on his arrival. "I wish I could prevail on you, at this late hour, to return with me. Don't you. think, doc- 'to; it would be very beneficial to the health of our friend?" "Captain, I hope you are not persuading Mrs. Graham to disappoint and grieve her friends I have no doubt it would be conducive to the health and happiness of the lady, but, I confess, it would be exceedingly annoying to me." The gallant tar looked searchingly at the speaker and then at Marian, who was evidently much em- barrassed; she looked annoyed that any one should have perceived it. None, however, beheld her per- turbation but the captain. Fanny's lynx eye was withdrawn at that mo-   270   ,i 1 MARIAN WALLACE. ment, by a remark made by Marmaduke; she feel- ing she could trust Everet for a moment, now as the visit had drawn to a close, and he had shown no disposition to withdraw from her society. The adieus were exchanged, and all 'were safely landed on torrm firma. -The sails were unfurled, the breeze bore the receding vessel farther from their view. God speed thee on thy way; may He thy helms- man be, to guide thee through the deep, and en- able thee to reach thy native land in safety. These were the feelings with which Marian gazed upon the deep blue sea upon which that frail bark float- ed majestically. Dr. Everet was in duty bound to wait upon Miss Graham to her residence, who rather reluctantly resigned him when she reached there, to the infinite amusement of Marian, who arrived in time to witness Fanny's discomfiture. Polite- ness demanded that the doctor should call upon the ladies the day following. The expected visitor was received by Fanny in a full blaze of fashion; his call was protracted beyond the prescribed limits, in hopes that Marian would make her appearance. Nor did he retire until he had made the inquiry, whether she was at home. he was answered in the negative, and immediately withdrew, much to the chagrin of that lady, to whom it had become sufficiently obvious, that he sought Marian, and   MARIAN  WALLACE.       271 overlooked all her blandishments. Terrible was the revolution of her feelings, on making the discovery. "Twice," said she to herself, "has that poor, pitiable worm stepped between me and happiness, with her quiet, indifferent manners. I spared her when my feelings prompted me to crush' her into nothingness, but now, Marian, nothing shall save you!" Was Marian as indifferent as the excited Fanny supposed? No. The intellectual conversation, the kind, friendly manner of the doctor, had left an impression time could never efface; frequently had she detected herself listening for his well-remeim- bered footstep; often would she feel annoyed if any thing prevented his accustomed visit. It must be the memory of home, thought she, with its magic influence, that blends harmoniously with our intercourse. Beware, Marian, flte citadel of your heart is about to surrender to a potentate whose power will sway the future course of your life. 'Weigh well, ere thy freedom is resigned, for days of sorrow and nights of anguish may be thy por- tion. Wilt thou have strength to sustain a larger share of calamity than has already been thy lot? Have a care, Marian, Dr. Everet differs materially from your late husband; James was yielding, he is   272     MARIAN WALLACE.  exacting; James Wvas satisfied with loving, Dr.  Everet only in being loved.            Ij It was with infinite satisfaction that Mr. Barlow i  saw Bristow take his departure from the village, after the late stormy interviews his fears had been aroused, lest he might use stratagem to gain an  interview with Flora, whose health improved but slowly. No entreaty could induce her to take ex- - ercise in the open air, lest she might be startled Ei by the appearance of Bristow. After his depart-   ure, however, Flora walked out daily'. Her strength j gradually returned. The suspicions and fear of her  friends were entirely lulled, with regard to Bristow. i He had been gone about two months. Their watch-  ! ful care had been oppressive to the invalid, who  felt how little she merited so much attention. The withdrawal of it had removed an oppressive load  ! from her heart; she could nowwander unattended   a without any fear of molestation. How often in   [ her wanderings did her thoughts revert to Shirly  Park. Fancy again revelled amid memories of the  moss-house, where night's silvery crescent crystal- ; ized the pebbly roof of the rustic grotto.     i In the midst of one of these reveries she was  startled by the rustling of the holly which grew i by her side. There stood Bristow, gazing upon  J! her. She attempted to scream, but immediately  r i   recollected how useless would be the effort, as it would be impossible to make her friends hear; courage and assistance must be imparted to her from on high. "Flora! my own dear Flora!" said Bristow, "naught shall again part us. Mr. Barlow denied me access to you after I had poured out my heart's grief to him in confidence. I thought he was my fiiend. Fly with me to some distant land, where I may spend the residue of my days in ministering to your comfort." "Bristow, my Father in Heaven knows how bit- terly I have mdurned my fall, how sincerely I have repented of the sin which banished me from the light of His countenance.  Oh may He vouch- safe me strength sufficient to continue in the path which leads to everlasting life. Terrible has been the ordeal through which I have had to pass. Tempt me not again td stray from the path of rectitude." "You never could have loved me, to speak thus." "Too fond has been fhe affection I entertained for you for my own peace,-loved, oh how fondly! -how sincere has been my love for you none but the searcher of hearts knows. I lavished upon you the wealth of affection, which was thrown back upon my, wounded heart." But, Flora, if you have entertained for me one    274     MARIAN WALLACE.  half: the affection you have professed, you would willingly fly with me to some distant solitude, where we could love each other unmolested."t "Bristow, do .you doubt the sincerity of my affec-  tion for you? Well may the thought intrude itself  since I have broken the vows plighted at the altar." "But, Flora, who first instilled the principle into your unsophisticated mind? Did not he who had promised to cherish and protect you? Did he not, for another, forsake you whom he had vowed at   . God's holy altar to love? Why then feel such a  repugnance to break the law which he has so wil- lingly violated? w hy fear to burst the fetters which he so carelessly severed?" Bristow, my husband sinned deeply; his cruelty and unkindness prepared the way for my fall, which' I mourn, as it were, in sackcloth. Then I walked in a way I knew not, but now I am clothed in my right mind. Were I to return to my wallowing in the mire, should I not be like. the man into ;: whom Satan entered the second time?"  "Flora; I believe Mr. Barlow has gained such an ascendancy over you that you cannot think or  speak without his approbation."         [ Oh, Bristow! do you think I utter truths to be thought well of by man, who am myself a very  outcast? . True, Mr. Barlow has guided me to seek  .. f   the better part; he has taught me to feel that the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin, that it was shed for me, a second Magdalen, scoried and for. saken by man. Thanks to that hol, man who has led me to the fount where flow the waters of life." "Flora, we are wasting time.  The post-coach is waiting at a short distance, to which I shall cer- tainly bear you." "He advanced at the same moment to execute his purpose. Flora put her trust in God, that God whom she sought to serve, who hath said, if ILis children call upon Hiln in the day of trouble, He will hear, answer, and deliver. She knew that she was beyond human aid, and seeing, from the ex- pression of' Bristow's countenance, that it would be useless to expostulate with him, she offered up a  fervent and audible prayer for the interpositio of  providence, to prevent an act from which her heart    I revolted. So overcome was he by the fervency of her petition, that he desisted from his attempt  and left her to restune her homeward walk. How filled with thankfulness was the heart of hat penitent one-.hei prayer had been heard and nswered in an almost miraculous manner. Bristow  vas pricked to the heart; the voice of conscience Munded in his ear; the sins of his past life ap-  eared in dread array before him. Mrs. Barlow - *  '         .A   '276     MARIAN WALLACE.            [ was alarmed when she saw the deathke pallor of Flora's countenance, and the visible agitation of her manner. Flora sought to compose herself, ere she detailed her interview with Bristow. Iow  i! feelingly did Mr. Barlow lay her case before the Lord when assembled for evening devotion. With .   X what heartfelt thankfulness did he acknowledge the hand of a mysterious Providence, and the super- intending care of a heavenly parent, who had en- abled her to control the natural tendency of her nature, in order that she might do His will.  A short time after this painful interview with Bristow, she was summoned one morning to the parlor, to see a stranger. She descended with a  beating heart, dreading lest the messenger might be sent by him.  What was her astonishment at seeing Carleton, whom, however, she feared to ques- i tion, lest he might be the bearer of intelligence  still more harrowing. It must have been business , ; of no ordinary importance, she tholght, that brought j him to her humble dwelling.  Mr. Barlow, how-  ever, came in, nuch to her relief, as well as of  y Carleton himself. He was courteously received by Mr. Barlow, who, discovering that there was some- thing of importance to be communicated, requested Flora to withdraw. She felt glad to escape fromn  this oppressive atmosphere. The import of the in- ' i: * i "a   telligence that he had to communicate was, that Stanhope had breathed his last in a small village in Greece, where he had retired with his Juliet, feeble health having deprived him of the power to fulfil his duties to his sovereign, to whom he had ever proved a faithful and valiant soldier.  Pity his fidelity could not have extended to the wife of his bosom; more apppriate then would have been 'the eulogium his country bestowed upon him. But life's fitful fever is over. Let him rest till the resurrection morn, when the trump shall awake both husband and wife, to receive the rewards of the deeds done in the body. Again did it become Mr. Barlow's duty to inflict pain on her, whose life must ever appear in sombre hues. In the most delicate manner the knowledge of this event was imparted to her. We dare not say Flora mourned for the husband of her yquth; yet. she sorrowed sincerely that his life had not been prolonged until he had made his peace with his God. She was now a widow indeed. IIad the tidings which had made her such been communicated earlier, Mr. Barlow thought, in all pBobability, the result of her inter- view with Bristow would have terminated much more amicably.    278     MAR1AN WALLACE. CHAPTER XVIII. "Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, Thou shalt not escape calumny." HAMLET. "MAIAN and Louisa Campbell were fast cement- ing the bonds of friendship, which Mrs. Graham favored. Marian could scarcely be considered other than a girl, though the garb bespoke her the mat- ron. She at length discovered that there existed no unity of feeling between her and her daughter; there was a degree of selfishness about Fanny which caused her mu ch uneasiness. Early had she endeay- ored to eradicate the germ of this obnoxious weed, which makes the possessor unhappy, unless all sub- mit to its sway. Marian was far from this trait of character, but she had others equally obnoxious. There was the pride of independence, unwilling to acknowledge or receive a favor; combined with a hasty temper; these, of themselves, were sufficient to make the possessor unhappy.- But with Louisa, good nature and amiability were the qualities a   MARIAN  WALLACE.      279 handsome face and form  enshrined. It was in consequence of this blemish in Marian's character, that Mrs. Gralam encouraged the intimacy, know- ing how susceptible human nature is to receive impressions, whether good or ill. Marian dare not examine the state of her heart in relation to Dr. Everet, whose attentions had become so flattering, as to be impossible to be misunderstood; she never had felt so happy as when by his side, which she almost feared was sacrilege to the dead. From the time Dr. Everet had shown such decided pref- erence for the society of Marian, Fanny had labor- ed assiduously in order that some pretext might be found sufficiently, tangible whereby her mother's confidence might be withdrawn. Her labors had been hitherto unsuccessful, and she feared lest her purpose should not be matured, until their vows were plighted-the. doctor's attentions being suffi- cient to warrant the. expectation of that event at no very distant period. Marian, she had discover- ed, was sincerely attached to him; to sever them would be the most acute punishment she could in- flict on her who had won twice where she had sought to bear the trophy. It might probably be some time before Dr. Everet would think his means sufficient to enable him to take Marian for his part- ner for life. Inflated with the evil design of giv- ;i A  '   280     MARIAN WALLACE. ing pain to another, Fanny sought her coadjutor in artifice, Mrs. Sydney, who, however, appeared rather indifferent to the garrulous Fanny, so much was she occupied by a lecture she had received from her liege lord on expenditure. Great was the ire of that lady, who considered her husband owed every thing to the generosity with which she had en- dowed him. "My dear Mrs. Sydney," said Fanny, "allow me to soothe the perturbed feelings from which you are suffering." Now, that Fanny should be an eye-witness to the ruffled state of her feelings, arising from such a source, was the very last thing Mrs. Sydney de- sired; rather would she have resigned the trio to the sharks, than have been discovered in such a deplorable plight; but since she had become so in- tirnate with Fanny, it was impossible to maintain any privacy in her domestic relations. Of course, all married people have unpleasant difficulties, which they do not care to blaze forth to the public. "I very much fear," said she, "Marmaduke's friendship for my husband is not calculated to re- strain his speculating propensities; I will ascertain this very day how far he has become involved." Marian was entirely unconscious of the feelings of jealousy which had taken possession of Fanny's   MARIAN WALLACE.        281 bosom, who now seldom made her appearance when Dr. Everet called. She threw the responsibility of entertaining him upon her and Mrs. Graham; and swiftly Mped the hours spent in the society of the doctor,/whose refined and intelligent mind ever afforded them instructive amusement. Mrs. Graham. saw' with pleasure, the intimacy, but while they were enjoying a large share of ra- tional amusement, Fanny was forming her wicked plans for blasting the happy confidence each re- posed in the other. Alone she formed those plans, and alone she executed them. After an evening spent in rational enjoyment, Marian had retired; Fanny and Mrs. Graham were alone. "Fanny," remarked her mother, "why do you continually absent yourself when Dr. Everet calls? It certainly has the appearance of marked indif- ference and impoliteness, especially when he ap- points an evening as he sometimes does." "Mother, you certainly cannot think that he wishes my presence? No, it is perfectly indifferent to the doctor whether I appear or not; and, if I must be candid, I think my absence is more desirable." ' Fanny, I think you are unjust to your friends." "My own good mother, you are so truly good as to be wholly incapable of judging the motives   282     MARIAN  WALLACE.  which emanate and spring from beings capable of  tle basest deception."' "Why, Fanny, you are looking at, and judging your friends with a prejudiced eye. What neces- sity can there be for Dr. Everet and Marian to  practise deception on your mother, who feels the  infirmity of old age making fast inroads upon her  clear mind and vigorous frame."      -  "It is on these very infirmities they build all  their hopes of success. Mother, dear, ask me not to divulge wherein consists the evidence of this perfidy. It is enough to know it does exist, and that the watchful care of an affectionate daughter will guard her loving mother from having these atrocities practised upon her."  "What atrocities could they be induced to com-  mit, that require the watchful care of my daughter, now that their plans are so far matured   . " "I fear my dear mother has so far committed her- self, that it will be impossible to retract. Mother, dear, Dr. Everet is comparatively poor, having no property independent of his profession; think you he would decline the acceptance if such 'were offered, ." "That I think would be unwise, provided he found i a sufficiently disinterested person to present him with it."   "But if he can gain it by artifice, through the manoeuverings of a deceitful woman, whom he pro- Tesses to admire ." "Fanny, if you mean Marian, I think the respect and admiration mutual; but she cannot give him the coveted treasure, having none at her disposal." "But, mother, may she not hope to 1obtain it tlrough the credulity of another, and then dispense her gifts to him whom she considers her liege? Mother, I warn you; she has ever had interested motives in the professions of regard which' she so bountifully bestows; she has made herself perfectly familiar with the right you have to dispose of your property as you should deem most agreeable, to the entire expulsion of your injured daughter. Gladly would I forego all claim, rather than my good mother should be so grossly imposed upon, by one whom she has befriended." "Fanny, recall the charge, lest I blush to own you as my child!-think of the enormity of the crime with which you charge one entirely unpro- tected." "Oh, the doctor will befriend her at all hazards." "Fanny, this surely could not have had its origin in your heart; tell me who has induced you to make such a startling declaration?"  "I am the sole originator of this gross slander, as    284     MARIAN WALLACE. you please to consider it, but it has been called forth by watchful care for my mother's interests. What think you would she care, after you had made a disposition of your property in her favor, but to purchase the man whom she particularly ad- mires a Were he to be made acquainted this night with the poverty of his bride elect, and the utter hopelessness of her being able to induce you to make a will in her favor, he would cast her aside for a more wealthy and beautiful one. I can speak to you with perfect disinterestedness, being pro- vided for by the kindness of my dear uncle, who, probably, foresaw some difficulty might arise to prevent me inheriting what is mine, I will not say by right." Peacefully rested the head of her who was the subject of this unpleasant discussion. Wealth was a small item in her storehouse of happiness; to be worthy of Everet was all she desired. Untir- ingly did she labor to acquire that knowledge best calculated to insure his respect. Though Fanny had refrained from any outward demonstration of hostility, Everet was constantly on the alert, lest any unforeseen circumstance should kindle the flame. Gladly did he discover that Marian's suspicions were entirely lulled by her apparent cordiality. Unable was he to account for the want of confidence which   MARIAN  WALLACE.      285 had taken possession of his mind; meeting her but seldom, and that in the most friendly manner. Why did she not inherit the amiability of her mother? . Could he but feel towards her as he felt when he grasped the hand of Mrs. Graham-who possessed a true Christian spirit. Was he unkind when contrasting their characters? The one en- dowed with all the characteristics of a meek and quiet spirit, desiring to do. the will of her master, and seeking to ameliorate the condition of the poor; the other seeking her own aggrandizement, indiffer- ent to the feelings of others, thankful she was much better than her neighbors, ever taking the highest seat in the synagogue-such were mother and daughter. This is not an overdrawn picture. Are there not seen every day. men. who keep clean the outside of the cup, while the inside is full of corruption? Fanny found more difficulty in prejudicing her mother's mind against Marian than she had antici- pated, and became fully convinced of her mother's attachment to the widow of James. She now be- gan to be seriously alarmed, knowing the tenacity with which age will- cling to an idea once enter- tained. She almost regretted having said any thing on the subject, lest that might actually take place which she appeared so much to dread. Marian's felicity was peaceful; there was none of that ideal e      o   286     MARIAN  WALLACE.  chimera which sometimes takes possession of the  f mind. She looked upon the person of her choice  as a rational and accountable being, who had se- . lected her among many more beautiful' to gaze upon-nay, far her superior in intellect and world- ly prosperity. Was it pity foi her desolate situa- j; tion that first won him to her side? Whatever  . it was, she loved him more thanl him she had,   : lost. There was more congeniality of feeling be- ' tween Marian and Everet than bver had or could  have existed with James, who she knew loved    { her to idolatry. She had esteemed and respected  him, and thought she returned his love. Alas!  1 how many take upon themselves the responsible  duties depending on the marriage state, who, in a  few years, find the sad mistake they made when they thought they loved. }arian was led, through  these very feelings, to reflect upon the possibility  that the time might arrive when she would be called to give him up. Could she resign him? Could  she bear to see him the beloved of another? Why had such a thought intruded itself? The very  thought was agonizing. His well-known step ban-  ished the unwelcome intruder. There was a shade of displeasure resting on Everet's brow as he bade her good evening, which, however, yielded to the friendly greeting, nor could she detect any evi- !]l   MARIAN  WALLACE.      287 deuce of its return when le bade her adieu. Yet she was thoughtful and unhappy after his depar- ture. She thought it might have been perplexity, arising from professional duties. There are many trying difficulties to the you!ig practitioner who essays to climb to eminence ulnassisted. IHe had no wealthy or influential relative, through whose assistance he might surmount the many obstacles which beset his patlh to preferment. Like herself, he was alone( and unfriended, a stranger in a strange land, with a mother and sister almost dependent on him for their maintenance. She knew how re- stricted must those means be, taking all things into consideration. Was it not likely that the shade of melancholy which stole across his lofty brow pro- ceeded from that cause . Fanny discovered about this time, that not only must her mother's suspicions be aroused, but Ma- rian's peace must be invaded-who now revelled in all the enjoyment of loving a being to whom she had given the homage of her proud heart. Can I but convince her, thought Fanny, that he is sordid;   that his professions are hollow, thai he would. now gladly resign her for a mere wealthy and beautiful one, did he not pity her hallucina- tion in supposing herself beloved by him, think you not her lofty head would bow with humility?  288     MARIAN WALLACE. Yes, yes, my haughty dame, I have you at. last; never shall you marry Everet, if I can prevent it; the shrine around which you have wreathed the affections which I supposed you incapable of, shall wither beneath the blighting frost of disappoint- ment, greater far than mine, which was only mo- mentary. I cannot, however, accomplish this end unaided. Marmaduke and Mrs. Sydney must be my coadjutors-able and efficient they have ever proved. Nothing daunted by the perfidy of her-design, she sallied forth to enlist the services of the worthy pair, who were ever ready to put forth a helping hand, in order that the peace or happiness of Ma- rian might be disturbed. Long was the consulta- tion of this amiable trio. To Marmaduke's power- ful and energetic stratagems was Everet consigned; Fanny was to use hers with Marian, ]trs. Sydney to remain ieady to assist on every important occasion. Strolling leisurely along Broadway, Marmaduke encountered Dr. Everet and Francis arm-iln-arm, chatting in the most amicable manner. Accosting them with his usual sang froid: "It is astonishing how closely competitors for the hand of our fair lady approximate. Were I Everet nothing is more certain, than that I should run you through the body, Francis, for the apparent     MARIAN WALLACE.        289 advantage you 'have gained, or else contemplate suicide; but here I find his arm resting securely as on the arm of a friend. Why, Everet, do you not know there is a traitor in the camp, and that the lady favors his suit I am very certain, how- ever, you are not one to hang your harp upon the willow, and sigh o'er the inconstancy of woman." Everet looked at that moment as if he contem- plated committing the fatal deed upon the speaker, who pretended to be particularly engaged in ex-  aminig a horse of exquisite proportions, ass he stood pawing the ground and tossing his jetty mane impatiently at the interminable duration of his mistress's toilet, who at length descended and placed her Cinderella foot in the brawny hand of her attendant, and sprung lightly to the saddle, to the infinite satisfaction of the gazer, who confessed her to be charming. Francis laughed gayly at Marinaduke's jest:- "The fellow is ever discovering something mar- vellous; pity to deceive him. Everet, of course, knows the contrary, as there appears to be an un- derstanding between them. What a rattle-brained, harum-scarum fellow he is. I wonder if he will ever become settled, and think and act like a man.'" The words of the rattle-brain fell with porten- tous weight on Everet, who had not regarded the 13     290     MARIAN WALLACE.  intimacy between Francis and the'lady of his choice altogether with satisfaction; he must reign suprene in the bosom of that being whom he:' deigned to honor with his preference. If Marian pfefers the attentions of her adopted brother, as Marmaduke declares, there is nothing left but to yield to him the vantage ground honorably, and without delay. In  whom could he place confidence, whln she, who appeared truth itself, enjoyed with conscious tri- umph the chains by which he had become enslaved, while preferring another.  Marmaduke availed himself of the earliest op- portunity to resume the conversation with Francis, who repudiated the idea. "Whyj I should consider it," said he, "an evi- dence of insanity on my part, even if I loved, to address her on the subject. Is she not the chosen  of Everet, whom she loves, and to whom I am ex- pected at some future time to act the part of a   s brother, and consign her to his keeping?"      b "Would you knowingly consign hei to one un-    a worthy?5              q. No."  "What would you do in such a case?"        re "I should expostulate with' her as a brother, and es iarn her as a friend. Should my entreaties prove  ta abortive, with sorrow would I resign the responsi- su   blity; never would I knowingly give her to a man dishonored, 'a man destitute of moral recti- tude." ' "Then, as a friend and brother, induce her to relinqulish Everet; he is a free-thinkcr, with quali- ties little calculated to makle happy the married life. I know' him to be such; yet I dare not ap- proach Mtlrianl on the subject; to me she would not listen, as she suspects the laxity of my princi- ples of morality, but gladly would I save her fiom the inevitable doom  to which she is hastening. You, Francis, must use your influence, but with the utmost caution in the manner which you con- vey the idea."  Francis listened to what he considered arose fiom the disinterested frieiidship of Marmaduke for Ma- rian, and promised to obey his directions implicitly. "What if I do now inflict pain," thought he, "will she not in after years feel thankful, for my stepping between her and life-long misery ? But I shall keep a watchful eye on Everet, in order to detect his fre- quent delinquencies." To the tender mercies of Fanny's 'vindictive rep- resentations was Marian indebted for the exalted estimation which Dr. Everet was supposed to enter- tain for her, which was not considered humiliation sufficient by the lady; she must needs lacerate the    292     MARIAN  WALLACE. heart of Marian, by informing her of the suspicions her mother entertained with regard to her reiter- ated professions of attachment. Mortification and prpressed rage blanched her cheek; it was some moments before she could command herself suffi- ciently t to repel the charge-which she did with all the vehemence her passionate disposition permitted. Marian forgot, while suffering from this unj ust ac- cusation, that affliction purifies the true believer in Christ; she forgot that sorrow and suffering were the means by which an all-wise Providence had drawn her to himself in times past. Had He now failed, and were His promises of no avail, that she could not recognize the hand of a heavenly Father uplifted upon Hs child, who was wandering almost imperceptibly from the path of duty? The creature was usurping the place of the Creator. Yes, Everet stood in tho way of many known lnd neglected duties, which hsle had dared to violate.. She re- solved to see him once more, and 1hear his opinion of her from his own lips-though. the words might paralyze her throbbing heart. The pride of her nature being thoroughly aroused, there was no tor- ture she felt inadequate to bear; loftily she deport- ed herself when in the presence of her tormentor- who watched with intense interest every look and gesture of the broken-hearted Marian.' No word A     ,    MARIAN WALLACE.        293 or look gave evidence of the volcanic fire which smouldered in her heart-the heart of one who now experienced eartl's darkest sorrow. What was life to her without Everet's soothing hand to cheer her aching blow?-a- desert waste, without one sunny spot in which to rest her fainting heart. "Oh that my heart were strong with faith's celestial light, to tread the desolating gloom of blighted hopes and cruel wrongs!" was the language of Marian's heart, whose pride almost precluded the possibility of de- manding an explanation from Everet. She could not upbraid him; how could she offer-him a love she fondly supposed he had sought? He, of course, would be satisfied, she thought, when she renounced all claim to his attentions. "Oh Everet," said Marian to herself, "the golden beams of life's sun set with thee; the rosy clouds of youth are fled; the requiem. of hopes forever dead sound in my desolate ear! You will be surrounded by loving and happy faces, which shall claim your care." She was in this fiame of mind when Francis was announced. The shadow which had gathered, in- stantly disappeared, as if by magic, crushing back her emotion, lest her friend might discover the sor- row. The rack of the inquisition could not have inflictedc more torture than did the conversation of her friend. Francis did but corroborate the aim-   294     AREIAN  WALLACE.  putation cast upon him by -Fanny.  Everet and M4arian met once again after Francis's discovery had been communicated.  They parted with the mutual conviction that each had loved unworthily- he more fully assured of the preference she enter-. tained for her adopted brother, she that Everet sought wealth, and was glad of an opportunity of extricating himself. Fearful was the strife in these two proud hearts to sustain the trials they were called upon to endure; neither would say aught to criminate the othei. This delicacy led to the unhappy result-that of irremediable separation. With heroic fortitude did she bear the raillery of ler friends. They could not elicit one remark calculated to enlighten them as to the disappear- ance of Everet for parts unknown. Francis was kind before, but doubly so now. Ilow deeply pain- ed would he have been to have known that this very kindness had banished the only man she had ever loved from her side. Iow exiltingly did Fanny gaze upon the evi- dence of her guilt. In what a ridiculous manner was Marian, in her sorrow, caricatured 'for the amusement of the trio. She was vainly endeavoring to collect the remnant of her late husband's prop- erty from the vice-like grasp with which Marma- duke retained it, in order that she might invest   the residue in some lucrative business. Mrs. Gra- ham's house no longer afforded her a peaceful asy- lum, owing to the unkind suspicions which had originated in the animosity Fanny had always en- tertained. That she could commit'such a great wickedness on one so peculiarly situated, and en- tirely frielndless, evidenced a want of feeling incon- sistent with the character of womain. Doctor Everet returned almost as mysteriously as he disappeared; some even doubted whether he had ever left the city. lie resumed his place and practice, pursuing the latter with vigorous assiduity. Not unfrequently was he seen hovering around the sweet and beautiful Louisa. Some smiled, others shook their heads in token of disapprobation. - Much had he seen of ier character to admire as the friend of Marian-the peculiar sweetness of her disposi- tion, the superior qualities of her mind, in which humble piety and fervent zeal blended harmonious- ly, rendering her at once attractive and dignified. Inumor was not long ill declaring her the affianced of Doctor Everet, which was subsequently confirmed by the gentleman himself. Louisa had heard from his own lips Marian's preference for another, her total indifference of manner when he endeavored to lead her to communicate her feelingl on the sub- ject. Her silent acquiescence in all she said so far   O     , b Al AI lA1N W ALLAUEi.  misled the lovely girl, she cheerfully gave him her Lhand as a token of her willingness to share life's joys and sorrows by his side. Marmaduke and Fanny were surprised at the un- expected turn their machinations had effected, which produced mutual recriminations. Marmaduke, of course, could offer no opposition to the interest and  welfare of his sister, whom he fondly loved. M r. ' Gamble, the father, strenuously opposed the alliance; I how could-he receive, as his son-in-law, a man so  closely allied to a woman he had so grossly deceiv- j ed? Was he not the nephew of hler who ought to  -have been his partner, and who had willingly yielded I her property to his management? had he not by    gross carelessness and extravagance beggared her, refusing, when it became known, to make her his bride, thereby sacrificing the only genuine feeling he ever knew, and rendering a cipher in society one who was in every way calculated to adorn the posi- tion she inherited?"What avails these scruples I entertain, so long as I dare not express them? How could I make my wife more unhappy than I have  ever done, by acknowledging I loved another, and squandered her property; then sought her hand, disbursing the wealth she possessed? Loving and  lovely as she has always proved, would it not be impolitic to call forth any expression of the hatred  *,   which my conduct merits? I amn an old man now, needing the loving attention kind hands bestow." Selfish in youth, selfish in old age, was the feeble being who soliloquized thus. Startling was the intelligence to his numerous circle of friends, that Dr. Everet intended marriage with Louisa. The first intimation that the friends received of the progress he had made in the heart of the fair girl, were the invitations to be ready at the appointed hour, in one of the fashionable churches, where the ceremony would be performed, and whence the happy pair were to depart, imme- diately after the ceremony, to rusticate amid the picturesque scenery with 'which the village of Len- nox is sunrounded.  Lovely did she look in her travelling attire, and for the information of our lady readers we will endeavor to describe the fabric it was composed of. It was a plain tabinet, of Irish manufacture, rich and massive in its folds, color of the most delicate- shade of lilac; hat of French straw, tastefully and beautifully trimmed with orange blossoms and lace.' The 'bride was pronounced love- ly-her attire was declared the most becoming and ecl/herche of the season. 13*   298      MARIAN   WALLACE. CHAPTER   XIX.

Manyl a noble youth  has been lured by silver- headed age to enroll himself as a candidate for gambling laurels, whose tightened pressure around the young aspirant Was like the coil of a venomous reptile, every turn pressing the victim closer, in- satiable in its effort to drain the life-blood of its victim. Among those collected around that table,   MARIAN  WALLACE.      299 the indulgence of which leads to dishonor and death, stood a youth, with a clear, noble brow. He turned to make a remark to his companion. Clear, musical, and manly were the tones of his voice, compared with those of the last player, who called the at- tention of the youth to his neglect of play. Apolo- gizing for his inattention, he immediately resumed the business of the table. All eyes were turned toward the spot where he stood, waiting with in- tense anxiety his tirow, having proved himself a powerful competitor for the rich harvest which lay in glittering heaps before them. With a steady hand and eagle eye, he threw. The gold was won. The demoniac expression of his companion's face glowed with fire, as he lhissed into the ,ear of the excited and successful youth, "Take it, and with it purchase back thy mother's lost honor; if needs be gold will brighten her tarnished name, you surely have enough."' "Villain! recall what thou hast said to the in- jury of my beloved and angel mother."' A smile of ineffable scorn lit lip the face of the accused, which had been livid with rage at the loss of his all. "Retract, when there are 'many in the room who even know the truth of my statement, of which you willingly plead such ignorance?"   300     MARIAN WALLACE. .' A friend, seeing the state of things, and the prob- able termination, drew the reluctant youth away in a state of great mental and bodily excitemen!t.  "Tell me, oh! tell me," said he, "that the accu-  sation against mypure mother is false. Why tlis  silence? Do you, too, believe the calumny?." '"Calm youirself, Stanhope," was all his friend l could say.  'Not until you, at least, declare her innocent."  "Would that I could, my dear boy; at least you have my sympathy.  Is this the first time  yotr have heard of the disgrace which has fallen upon your ancestors through the author of your being? And from such a source, and under such   circumstances, sincerely do I pity you."  'I was not ignorant that some unpleasant difi- culty existed between my parents.

Vainly did the good Samaritan endeavor to allay the excited state of Frank's feelings, waiting upon hin to his hotel, nor did he leave him till he saw him settled for the night, (or rather morning,) evi- dently evincing a desire to be alone. Silence reigned in that apartment after the de- parture of his friend. Rising, after some time spent in a death-like stupor, and seating himself at the escritoir, with a caln and steady hand he com- menced writing with rapidity. One, two, .three letters were sealed and directed to the individuals for whom they were intended.  Then opening a private drawer, he took from it a small pocket- pistol and examined it carefully. There was a re- port, and all was again still. When found, that noble heart had ceased to beat. No cause could be assigned by his friends for the perpetration of the rash act. Fearfully was the sin of the parent visited upon the child, who rushed, unprepared, into the presence of his Maker, rather than endure the contumely which her conduct lhad cast upon him.    802     .MA lA AN WA LA CI. IJ. Even the enemies of Mrs. Leslie could not with- i hold their sympathy when the news reached her of the sudden death of her grandchild. How vivid- ly had the portraiture of his mind been conveyed through the medium of his letter, addressed to lher while standing on the verge of the grave in the bloom of health. She felt that the retributive jus- tice of' high heaven was being poured on her guilty head. How affectionately he had committed Marian to her care, praying that she would institute an im- mediate search for the lost loved one, whom she had so long pursued in rancorous hatred, and banished from a home 'where the arm of kindness was ready to protect and defend her-desolating the hearth- stone of the cottage where she lived securely, in the love of which death has now robbed her. Had his dying request arrived in time, sle did not know but she might have been induced to comply with it. Miss Woolsey had made a disposition in her favor of all she possessed. Though the undisputed pos- sessor of thousands already, she could not bear to see so many precious relics of her beloved mother pass into stranger hands. Avarice was conspicuous in all the actions of Mrs. Leslie's life. She paced the stately halls of her fathers in utter abandonment-halls which the tiny feet of him who now spoke to her from the- grave had trod in in-   MARIAN  WALLACE.      303 fantile innocence, and the echo of whose footfalls vibrated with distinct precision on the tablets of her memory. Could he, the scion of her house- of whose chivalry the bards had storied in 'their sweetest strains-could he rush upon self-destruction with a cowardice unbefitting the heroes from whom he sprling? "Oh Frank, Frank I must the boasted valor of my house perish with thee?

Oh that I could have laid her, in all her baby loveliness, in the dark sepulchre, ere sin had tainted her mind!

What a pillow of thorns does my aching head repose on!-the envied of manr, who, could they but look into the recesses of my heart---- There wis a hurrying to and fro along the vaulted corridor of Shirly Park; its noble owner lay grap- pling with the king of terrors. The soft rays of the astral lamp shed its subdued light on the stricken attendant, who moaned, spectrA-like, in that deep recessed room, where stood the high canopied bed,   306     MARIAN  WALLACE.     \ with the arms of the Mortimers and Leslies en-, twined with the jfeur-de-ls, on which reclined the sufferer, and by her side knelt the weeping Caro- line, almiost' concealed by the folds of dark velvet which, draped and shed a sepulchral gloom on the featuires of her who lay extended beneath the cov- erlid of amber satin. "Caroline, send Banklead to me." Poor child, she thought her grandparent's mind wandered, never having heard of any one by that name. "Who does mny dear grandmamma want   Can I not supply their place" " "Supply their place, poor innocent! Can a lamb supply the place of a vulture? Whom did I ask for, you look so surprised? Does my mind indeed wander! Forbid, high Heaven! whom I have in- sulted; much, very much have I to arrange. Per- mit me strength to make restitution while it is in my power.  It was Mrs. Carleton that I wished to see. Quick, Caroline, bring her to me immedi- - ately."' Caroline motioned to an attendant, who was in- stantly by her side, and delivered the suffeer's mes- sage, with injunctions that it should be executed with the utmost dispatch. As the courier had, many miles to travel, ere the lady could appear in the   MARIAN  WALLACE.       807 presence of her grandmammna, languidly did the head of the invalid turn at each alarum of the re- peater, as it told the hours as they passed; well did she know those hours were numbered to her on earth. Mrs. Carleton entered the chamber of death with a conscious dignity of holding a supe- rior in bondage, to her sway-gliding, with all the haugltiness she could assume, to a seat by the side of - her who had ministered to her support. Mrs. Leslie motioned to Caroline and her attendants to withdraw. Mrs. Carleton and she were alone; what transpired during that interview the records of the last day alone can disclose. When leaving that chamber, whose occupant was passing to the unseen and untried world beyond Jordan's dark waters, she held tightly clasped a casket, the con- tents of which caused numerous surmises among the household. Bulletins issued hourly the state of the invalid's health from the Park to the nu- merous tenantry, who thronged its gates, who re- vered, almost to idolatry, the stock from whence She sprung. And when the sad news was imparted, ;hat she was no more, sincere and heartfelt was heir sorrow, and in vast cconurse did they con- rregate to pay the last tribute of respect to her nemory; for miles were the peasants to be seen, nweariedly following her remains to the house l^3e                     \   308     MARIAAN  WALLACE. appointed for all living, which was a three-days' journey from Shirly Park. Many of those poor but affectionate creatures performed that long journey on foot, that they might see the remains of her whom they had served committed to the dust. The death of Mrs. Leslie and Frank Stanhope was duly announced to Mr. Barlow by the brother of Flora, and the heir, of Shirly Park, the coveted residence of his lady, who had gazed upon it with longing eyes, sighing to be the possessor of that princely mansion. laving no children, in case of his death, it must naturally revert to Caroline, whom he insisted should still consider it as her home. 'William Leslie loved his sister Flora, though he abhorred the crime which had debarred her the privilege of mingling among them. Could he have persuaded his wife to offer her an asylum in the halls of her youth, gladly would he have extended his arms to receive her, though she would have been but a secluded inmate. Mrs. Leshe was in- exorable on that point. He collected every me- mento of former years which he. thought would gladden the heart of his sister, adding a large amount to the already large sunm allowed by his late father, begging Mr. Barlow to withhold the manner of Frank's death. We left Marian trying to collect the remainder   MARIAN WALLACE.        309 of the money invested ly her late husband in his business, which had never been accounted for, and the mistaken pride of Marianihad prevented her demanding it as a right from one who evinced so much tardiness in complying with what she knew to be the wishes of her husband. The little pit- tances she had received from time to time, she had hoarded carefully, that she might the less frequently be obliged to call upon him. But the time had arrived when she must lay aside the scruples of delicacy and submit to what she considered humili- ation. After making this demand, Marmaduke de- manded receipts for the money received from time to time. Poor thing! she had kept no account. Frightful was the array which appeared on his Memorandum, and small was the balance in her favor; nevertheless she took it thankfully. "Let the worst come to the worst, can I not earn my livelihood, as before? Though a few years of do- mestic happiness have dawned upon my hitherto beclouded life, has its joys unfitted me to struggle again with the trials which beset my path? Rather may the recollection of departed joys stimulate me to renewed efforts. My deficiency in business tran- sactions has led to unpleasant results, which I must endeavor to obviate, by attending more closely for the future to it. Yet I hate the name of money.   810     MARI IXN WALLACE. Has it not sent me forth again to the world broken- hearted?

Well was it for Marian that circumst ances de- manded her immediate attention, for the misan- thropy which was creeping slowly upon her, would, in a short time, have unfitted her foi the labors of life. When removed from the observing eyes of those who had inflicted this deep wrong, she yielded to the oppressive grief which preyed so 'heavily upon her.

Her death was calm and peaceful as a summer's day. "Faith pierces the vista of Jordan's deep gloom, And points to the land where immortal she'll bloom." Some time before her death' Miss Woolsey had been, removed to Shirly Park, where she received every kindnesslwhich could be bestowed. The cap- tain was sorry hle said, to have to inform Miarian, that her aunt had not left her any tangible evidence of her affection. Mrs. Leslie 'had taken possession of all her effects, to the entire exclusion of some dis- tant relatives. Her house and annuity, having been presented by the family, of course reverted to them again; but there were many valuable personal ef- fects to which Mrs. Leshe was not-entitled, and to which the captain regarded Marian as the proper claimant, although Mrs. Leslie and he differed on   ,MARIAN       WALLACE.   . '  that point, he having even gone so far as to-express to that lady his doubts as to the influences which had been brought to bearon Miss Woolsey.  The captain taking for granted that Marian'was Mrs. Everet, oIr very soon would be, playfully ad-  verted to the doctor; cautioning Marian as to his  peculiarities. Strong. and inflexible he declared him to be, and proud and sensitive in the extreme; and that the only way for her was to strike colors and *. yield implicit obedience to him he knew she loved, and to whom her departed attt -would gladly have'  resigned her. Since his narriage Marian had sought carefully. and piayerfully to guide her thoughts from wander- ing to that dear forbidden object. Everet's conduct -had told upon her hitherto healthy firame; :this re-- cent affliction prostrated her upon a bed of suffering. We will not follow the doctor and his lady during their bridal tour, but just look in upona their snug  little parlor, he having just returned from a fa- tiguing day's visiting among his patients. There appeared to be more than the ordinary amount of nervous diseases among that class who have little or nothing to employ their precious time, which a beneficent God has committed to themn that it might be devoted to the service of suffering humanity. Could they but leave their luxurious homes, and     MARIAN  WALLACE.       313 visit the abodes of wretchedness, where want and suffering go handc in hand, would they not find employment for the surplus time, wherein they discover those imaginary diseases which a life of ease engenders? Louisa had drawn the easy chair close to the cheerful fire, which he loved to see sending its ruddy glow into -ery nook and cor- ner of the comfortable room, where presided one of 'the sweetest of wives, attending to all things relative to her husband's comfort. Every evening stood his chair in its accustomed place, his slippers occupying a snug corner on the polished steel fender -his dressing-gown brought to him by the gentlest of hands, with a coaxing entreaty to put it on and rest before tea. "   I   I 314      MARI AN WALLACE.   CHAPTER XX.

EYERET thought he was happy, and had every        : reason to be so, sure of the affections of a lovely and gifted being.  But why did Marian ever appear  before his mind's eye.    Why did he sometimes     ! detect himself in the act of pronouncing her name when addressing his wife2   Had she not willingly resigned him  for another?   Were such thoughts not unjust to the being before him    Still, at times, they would intrude themselves--at times, would their last interview, tinged with memories of the past, appear before him.   Again would his imagi-  nation picture her as the gentle and sorrowful one who had twined herself around his heart.     Loisa  was blissfully ignorant of the conflicts of her hus- . ;     '   t I,   MARIAN WALLACE.       315 band; loving him with a fervor which would end but with her life, she doubted not the sincerity of his, who was ever gentle and affectionate to her. Having once or twice mentioned her surprise that Francis and Marian had not yet been married, she observed that the remark seemed to displease her husband, and consequently abstained from making any farther comments, yet she could not understand why he should be displeased. Everet sat for some time looking at the paper which he held in his hand, but Louisa saw he read not; her loving eye detected an unusual flush on his cheek. Going up to where he sat, and putting her arm around him, she gently drew his head, till it rested on her bosom. "Everet, are you unwell?" "No, Louisa." "Then what is the matter?" "Nothing, only a little out of sorts. My head has ached more or less all day.' "Then let me persuade you to take a cup of tea, it will refresh you; you know it is a woman's invaluable' remedy." "Dear Louisa, who but a good little wife like you could have detected any thing amiss? Ought I not to be the happiest man on earth, with this dear little hand pressing my aching temples?

Has not the Creator of the universe showered Hiss mercies on my unworthy head, who, for all this kindness, withholds the only boon He craves. To  ] His earnest entreaty, ' M son, give me thine heart,'  have I not turned a deaf ear? Fondly have I fol- lowed the allurements of this world. Too muh   i have I been engrossed with things of time." "My dear husband, how glad I am to hear you talk thus. How glad I am to hear that the eyes  of your understanding are opened, that your grate- ful heart acknowledges the goodness of the Lord. Forgive me for speaking thus."          ij "Louisa, how could I remain indifferent, when i you present such a beautiful consistency? Does not your life bear testimony that you have been i with Christ, and learned of Him who was meek and lowly?" A call to attend a patient interrupted this inter-  esting conversation. "Everet, do you think the case is so urgent as to require your immediate attendance? Could it  not possibly be deferred until morning? You look  almost worn out."  "I rather think not. But I shall return on the wings of love, knowing what a sweet, anxious face watches for my return." :-i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      317 She acknowledged her anxiety.  Recently the faculty had lost two of its most skillful members by the prevailing epidemic. "Oh Everet, should you fall a victim!" "Louisa, should I not fall in the discharge of my duty  Would you have me shrink back a coward when danger besets my path?  Why, I thought I had a little hero for a wife." "'Oh Everet, I am timid when danger gathers around the beloved of my heart." "Adieu, my dear, I shall return as soon as I have prescribed some alleviating remedy for the poor fellow who is suffering." Louisa watched the receding form of her hus- band, whose step appeared less buoyant than usual. She committed him to the care of that God in whose hands are the issues of life. The following day Dr. Everet was unable to leave his bed. How did the heart of his fond wife sink as she gazed upon his feverish brow and parched lips? Well did she know that the being around whom the affections of her heart had centered, had that too fatal disease coursing through his veins, by which many had been cut down in the prime of life, and which was raging with such violence in certain sections of the city, almost amounting to a plague. Lovingly did she arrange the pillows, that the loved   318     MARIAN WALLACE. head, frenzied by fever, might rest, unconscious of the being who ministered to his wants, amid the ravings ofi delirium. Louisa ever heard the name of Marian on his lips. When she presented the cooling draught, it was Marian he thanked. For fourteen nights and days did the sufferer's life hang, as it were, on a thread. Louisa never left the side of her husband. 'Twas she who tended and watch- ed every varying symptom.  No token of recog- nition, no tone of affection, met her ear. All his thoughts were lavished on one who had scorned the rich garniture of his love, for which she, his wife, would willingly died to know herself the pos- sessor. That long, deep sleep, on which hangs all the hopes of loving ones, had taken possession of the sufferer. His sorrowful wife gazed on the sunken features of the sleeper, on whom death had, as it were, set 'his seal. Could she resign him at the command of her Heavenly Father?   Could she yield the chosen of her heart to the grave? Bitter was the draught presented to her by Him  who doeth all things well. Severe were the chastisements of the Lord, of which she must not be weary or despise, for r'whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, even as a father a. son in whom he delighteth." Could she live a life of wretchedness if the Lord i /       w Z   MARIAN WALLACE.        319 heard her petition and spared him, knowing, as she now. did, that he had married her while he loved another? His kind and tender care sprung not from the depth of his love, but from the innate goodness of his heart. "Can I live," she asked herself, "beggared of the affections for which I pine. Oh Everet, if thou art spared to me, never will I, by word or sign, betray the knowledge that I am possessed of thy secret. Chiefly will I try to win what I once thought I possessed." The desire of the wife's heart was gratified-her husband awoke conscious, though feeble as an infant on its mother's breast. How sweetly did she bear with all the weariness of the invalid, in his protract- ed recovery; frequently did her strength seem likely to 'yield under the unreasonable demands of him who could scarcely be pronounced convalescent. How supremely selfish do the best of men be- come, when every want in the sick room is attended to with punctuality. By her patient endurance she hoped to gain his love. Often would she think, if Marian had performed but one-half, how much greater would have been her recompense. Louisa suffeied both mentally and bodily-wronging the husband whom she adored. Everet would scarcely have dared to own to himself what in his delirium had been revealed to his wife. He had never dwelt   320     MARIAN WALLACE.  upon the thoughts that obtruded themselves like unwelcome visitants, and when his wife would gaze  on him with sorrowful eyes, he would kiss her pale  cheek, and declare himself well again. His friends  having been forbidden the sick chamber, lest they might contract the disease, Louisa was his only companion. Her changed countenance and fragile  form gave more uneasiness to her husband than he [  was willing she should know. He insisted upon her spending more time in the open air, and to enable  her to do so, proposed substituting her mother as  nurse, under whose supervision he thought he  should improve amazingly. It was quite useless for Louisa to declare herself perfectly well; Everet had  such a way of making others yield, that, almost be- fore she was aware, she was hurrying away with all the speed her feeble body permitted. The close con- i Iinement of the sick room, and the painful knowl- edge communicated to her unintentionally-which  had entered like a barbed arrow, to rankle in her heart until the realities of life were past-had given her constitution such a shock that air and exercise could never restore it to its wonted vigor. "Why, Louisa, is Everet more unwell than usual, that you look so sad this morning?" "I am happy to say, my dear brother, that my husband is improving." *i   MAI A N  WA lLACE.     321 "Then why that woe-begone countenance '" Could Marmaduke have knownjhy his sister looked so unhappy; could he have known that it was he that had planted thorns in the domestic path- way; could he have realized at that moment, how his own evil intentions to injure a being entirely unproteited, had fallen on a sister whom he fondly loved, how unenviable would have been his state of mind! But iarmaduke was ignorant of his sister's wretchedness. "Louisa," said he, "have you for- gotten your old friend Marian?" "No, brother, I have not forgotten her, nor am I ever likely to?" Louisa longed to hear of her, but dared not trust herself to pronounce her name. Marmaduke in- formed his sister, that from the time she had left Mrs. Graham's, or very shortly after, all traces of her had been lost. "She was so deucedly proud," said he, " as to disdain making any acknowledgments."' "Of what was she charged?" "Oh, some crime of Fanny's concocting," "Because she charges Marian with a crime which only originated in her own fertile imagination, is that what my brother admires in a young lady?" "Do not be so censorious, my sweet sister, for to her machinations you are indebted for the honor of being Everet's wife." "*   322     MARIAN WALLACE.  "Marmaduke! Brother, say not so! say- not that your sister has been sacrificed for the gratification t of the basest passion inherent in our nlature! i "In what does the sacrifice consist? Is he not  kind? Let him dare, by word or look, evince any  repugnance to her who stands related to nme as a  sister!"  "Marmaduke, answer me one question faithfully -have you any reason to suppose she ever loved him?"  "I rather thinl she did. But we will explain  all to you another time. I have now to fulfil an  engagement with Fanny."     . Louisa longed to hide her sorrows in the grave. Innocently had she supplanted another; but she controlled all evidence of sorrow when in the pres-  ence of her husband, who nevertheless saw a marked  ! I change in the deportment of his wife. She was no ! longer the loving, sunny being he had led to the i altar. Affectionately did he cheer her; but the - worm was knawing at her heart. "Since the departure of Marian, as Marmaduke  had stated, nothing definite had been ascertained i respecting hel, by those who lhad sought to over- throw her happiness.              : In a miserable apartment, alone and unfriended, ; lay Marian, prostrate on a bed, from which she ex- i! t,    MARIAN WALLACE.        323 pected, nay, sometimes hoped, never to rise. Young as she was, she thought she had outlived all her friends. Welcome to her would the cold grave be. How welcome the release which would exempt her from the trials of life! Toil and sorrow had ever accompanied her through the journey, the termina- tion of which she felt to be at hand. In early life she had struggled to maintain an independence. Pride and determination had enabled her to break down every barrier which stood in the way of her advancement. The strangers' God had guided her youthful steps securely in slippery places, in answer to petitions to the throne of love in her behalf. Hope beat high in that young bosom, when a stran- ger she planted her foot on a foreign soil. Disap- pointment, with its darkened veil, obstructed the light of hope. No ray of its cheering beams gleam- ed through the blackened pall ; even the light of eternt truth was shrouded; she could not see the hand that led her; she could not hear the voice that hath declared: "I will be with thee'in the sixth trouble, and in the seventh I will not forsake thee." Marian's condition was truly deplorable; night after night had she toiled to earn a bare subsist- ence; the rays of the morning sun would remind her she had taken no rest Worn and exhausted would she throw herself down to catch a few mo- t   324     MA IA N W A J I AC C&E.  ments' repose, that she might be better enabled to bear the labors of the coiing day. She had been induced by thel/disinterestedness of an apparent friend to invest her little all in a  business in which they were to divide the proceeds, and she perform the labor. Being entirely ignorant of the manner in which business partnerships were conducted, Marian became the dupe of one who had  grown gray in contact with the world, and who  ' when her health failed abandoned her to want. Such was the position in which the amiable and kind Mrs. Beaumont found her, destitute of even the necessaries to make life comfortable, yet too proud to make known her situation, had it not  been for the kind interference of this truly benevo- lent person, who was directed by a special inter-  position of Providence to seek out the lost Marian, i whom she had known in former years. Kindly :and liberally did she minister to her waats. Gently were the words of comfort poured like oil into her wounded heart. Patiently did she submit to the frequent moods of melancholy that had taken possession of her mind, as she regained her health. Disappointment had changed her sanguine tempera- ment into mis:anthropy, which the loving harmony  of Mrs. Beaumont's family could not expel; she there-  fore left it to time to effect what sympathy could not , ,    MARIAN WALLACE.        ;S25 perform. The youngest of this domestic group, with flaxen hair and blue eyes, was the first to win her way, the first to cause her pent-up tears to flow. What a relief to that surcharged heart! What a luxury to that stricken one was it when she pressed the prattler to her aching heart! In that embrace, the bonds of love were cemented between rosy childhood and one of maturer years, on whom the sorrows of life had fallen heavily. Yet, even here Miarian was not exempt from trial. Her sensitively organized mind, and the innate pride of her na- ture, precluded all possibility of happiness in a de- pendant's position. She, therefore, exerted herself to the utmost to6 render an equivalent for kindness extended with a willing hand, and well was it that she considered it necessary to arouse herself, or the lethargy which had stolen unconsciously across her stricken mind would have rendered her unfit for the duties of life. The arrow of conviction had pierced the heart of Bristow. Clearly had the truths of the Gospel portrayed his lost and ruined state, with the sword of Divine justice hanging over his guilty head. The language of his heart was, "Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of sinl? " , even I am HeH that blotteth out thy transgression. I will remember thy sin no more,"   326     MARIAN  WALLACE. came like a healing balm to his sin-sick soul. Did He not pardon the thief on the cross? Did He   : not forgive the sins of David, Iis servant, when he i had stolen the ewe lamb and cherished it in his bosom. Then came the awful denunciation, "No adulterer can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." No, not unregenerated. Had not Christ come into the world to save sinners? As one promise en- couraged, in another he read his own condemna- tion. Joy and gloom alternately filled the measure  of his days, until the Divine blessing was poured as a ray of light into his mind, by that cheering and encouraging passage, "If the sinner forsakes , his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,  then I will have compassion on him." Now, Hle, 1 the searcher of hearts, knew how sincerely he wish- - I ed to turn from the error of his way and lead a  new life, walking in all the commandments of his Lord. Closely did he. cling to the Rock of Ages, who was a sure covert from the storm, trusting in the atonement. Humbly did he lay all his sins at the I, foot of the Cross, believing that He was able to save to the utmost. The word of God became a  light to his feet, and a lamp to his path. The lan- I guage of his heart was-             '1 "Amazing love, and can it be,  That Christ from sin can setme free?"    ' "             ,     . ......  - vX J u o ])  Yes, he felt he had not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. On that plea he rested his hope of salvation, believing himself to be the greatest sinner that had ever lived. When he was brought by the power of God from death unto life, his joy knew no bounds. The Life of Colonel Gar- diner was put into his hands at this time; it proved manna to his soul. His furlow having expired, orders arrived from the war department, that he should join his regiment, which was now doing duty on a foreign station. Before leaving his native land, he penned an humble epistle to Mr. Barlow, apolo- gizing for his ungentlemanly conduct to him, ex- pressing his sincere repentance for the sins of his past life, and his faith in the pardoning love of Christ, who is able to make us wise unto salvation. On the subject of Flora he was silent. Everet saw the wife of his bosom passing away, unable to stay the destroyer, unable to save her loved form from the cold and silent tomb. He bore her to her native land, where she might breathe the pure mountain air, and might be tended by the gentlest of nurses, his own fondly loved mother: The parting with her father and brother was pain fully solemn. Marmaduke was deeply affected; tears coursed their way down cheeks unused to na- tre's crystal showers.   5     MARIAJN  WALLAC iE.           ;I Louisa bore the fatigue of the voyage on the-wide Atlantic better than her husband feared she would. Anxiously did the mother gaze upon the transparent face of her beloved child, as each day saw the hectic flush deepen on her cheek. 'Was not the apparent amendment in her daughter's health sufficient com- pensation for the painful emotions which filled her heart at the prospect of revisiting scenes where wealth and happiness had dawned upon her? Pain- fully embarrassing as it would k1 to renew intima- cies which the imprudent conduct of her husband had obliged her to sever, how painful to take her place among her kindred where he woild have been excluded. She feared too for the fragile flower, her exotic, lest an unguarded expression might betray the imprudence of him whom ghe c led father. Such were the feelings of Mrs. Gamble, as each suc- ceeding wave bore her farther from home, and wafted her nearer that of her love--the clistering associations of each, with all their hallowed influ- ences, rising before her. Gladly would she have sacrificed every earthly consideration that the health of her daughter might be thereby established. When the weather was warm and pleasant, Ev- eret would bear his precious charge from the state- room, to inhale the balmy air, and gaze upon the blue expanse; with a hand in each of his, she would   M1ARIAN WALLACE.   contemplate the lofty billows of His power who had folrmed the little industrious ant-the same hand had fiashioned it in ifs insignificance, the same power stayed the swelling billows, which rose in such grandeur before her. Kindly and lovingly was the invalid folded in the arms of Everet's mother, after a tedious passage of eight weeks. Sisterly arms entwined an affection- ate'brother, who had brought his tropical plant to their northern home. Lovingly was she welcomed to their hearth; sincere were the petitions offered to the throne of grace, that the voyage might be beneficial. They bore her to a snug little room draped in white; the soft strain of the Eolian swept across the low latticed window, which opened on as lovely a landscape as ever met the enraptured gaze, of the artist. The meeting was unexpected between Mrs. Everet and Mrs. Gamble.    They had known each other in girlhood. Not having been informed who were the parents of Louisa, Mrs. Everet took it for grant- ed that they were Americans by birth. It was a pleasure to hear the two fiiends converse.  There were the friends of formner years to be inquired af- ter. Many sad recollections were awakened. Many loved ones had joined the pale nations of the dead. As soon as Louisa was able to bear it, there   3J0     MARIAN WALLACE. was a consultation of the best medical advice which her husband could procure, the result of which cast a shadow upon all minds. Disease had made too rapid progress to be arrested. Nothing could be done but to alleviate the sufferer by simple rem- edies, soothing in their influence. Miss Harvey was deeply affected when she gazed upon the lin-  eaments of Gamble's child, and traced in them the resemblance to him who had won her heart. Though she had deprecated his conduct as base, she had never ceased to love him.; and now, in the twi- light of her life, she looked upon one so nearly allied to him, the suavity of wlose manner won  its way to the heart of her father's first love. But love could hot stay the chariot-wheels of death, which was coursing with fearful velocity. Already was it apparent to all, that she-the good, the ami-  able-must die. Yes, she must rest in a stranger grave. All this she knew, yet she dreaded not to enter its dark portals by theeye of faith. Christ her Saviour had left the light of His reconciled  countenance there. Could aught be dark or dreary where the ray of His love pierced? Louisa knew that the narrow stream but divided her from the  Saviour of her choice, and that when it was passed ? the full blaze of His glory would burst upon her enraptured sight. Gently did the sufferer fade, , ., id   day by day.  Soon they laid her in that quiet church-yard, and returned to their desolate home. Everet mourned the loss of his wife, whom he had learned to love and appreciate. They planted flowers, such as she loved, on her grave, after water- ing them with their tears. Everet remained with his mother, and Mrs. Gamble with her friend, until the flowers bloomed again in all their loveliness, but she, over whose remains they raised their lovely heads, bloomed in the world of spirits. On the eve of their departure, Everet's sister expressed a wish to possess herself of a small writing-desk which had been the constant companion of the lost one. Nothing had been disturbed since her decease; every thing remained as she had left them; neither Everet nor her mother had felt able to examine its contents. This reminded them of the necessity there was that all these matters should be attended to. With the sanction of her mother, the desk was transferred to his sister. When opened, it was found to contain her journal, and a-letter addressed to her husband, with the request that the seal should not be broken until she had lain in the grave one year. The mourner spent the few remaining hours by the grave of the departed. It was by the great- est difficulty Mrs. Gamble could be induced to leave the hallowed spot where rested her loved one.   832      MARIAN   WALLACE. / CHAPTER XXI. Back, truant thoughs, why will you stray To onq who cast my love away, And left me in the noon-tide hour To mourn his loss, yet own his power- A power which reason must control, Ere I can chase thee from my soul, Or bid those latent springs of pride Roll on in life's forgetful tide. AMONG Mrs. Beaumont's visiting circle were many who had known Marian, many by whom      she had been employed.  They avoided any recognition of her, or treated her in such a patronizing manner, as to wound the sensitive feelings of her who sought, amid the cares of this lady's domestic arrangements,  to still the throbbings of her sorrow-stricken heart. There were many who feared to treat her with  common civility, lest they might compromise their dignity with the circle in which they moved.   Ma- rian kept aloof from all, not being able to discrim- inate among them.   This distant bearing, which had been called forth by their own conduct towards    j the really unhappy girl, received their severe cen- sure.  The haughtiness of her bearing was con- :i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      333 sidered incompatible with her present position; but had she been free and easy in her deportment, she would, probably, have been denounced as a for- ward, presuming woman, who had forgotten the distance which separated them. Mrs. Beaumont frequently pointed out to Marian the errors of her proud nature. "Iow can I feel otlerwise?" she replied, " when even he from whose lips the words of life fall, like manna to the children of Israel, on my ear, forgets that lie is the messenger of the Most High, and ex- hibits the weakness of human nature, in an ostenta- tiousness of manner inconsistent with the Christian character?' Marian toiled as faithfully as her feeble health permitted. The extreme kindness of Mrs. Beaumont would have exempted her from much she felt it her duty to perform; for this Marian was not ungrate- ful, though unable to express the language of her heart; she gave, however, the most tangible evi- dence of it in her willingness to lighten the domestic burdens of the lady's well-regulated establishment. She had much to learn, which made her less effi- cient than her heart dictated. Of Fanny Marian lhad longed ceased to hear, being entirely removed from those who could im- part any information of the author of her later   334     MARIAN WALLACE. misfortunes. The afflictions which Divine Provi- dence had sent by death, she endeavored to bear  with fortitude, knowing they .were sent by a kind and merciful power, who doth not willingly afflict; but when human .agency was permitted, to heap ac- cumulated wrongs upon her, she was unable to bow with humble resignation, she was unable to kiss the rod, held by a loving parent. Her selfish heart re- lled under the severe chastisement. / While Marian mourned, Fanny was trying to weave her meshes again around Everet. The blan- dishment of her manner had received a fresh impe- tus for display, which it would now be impossible to stand. Her motto was: "I came, he saw, I con- quered!"                 .    i Oh, vanity of vanities! Think you he has for-' gotten former errors? think you he has forgotten your duplicity to one he adored? No, Fanny! you will never be any thing but a secondary consid- eration to the interesting widower. Marmaduke rallied her on the exuberance of her spirits; he fore- saw the downfall of all her hopes, on the wreck of which he intended to raise the superstructure of his future fortune. When the last lingering'hope had fled, for fly it must, his intentions were to accept the crestfallen Fanny himself, in consideration of the tangible benefits he would thereby derive. * i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      335 The fame of Mr. Barlow's piety, and of the bril- liancy of his talents, had been borne across the waves of the Atlantic, and had reached the metrop- olis. Frequently had he been invited to accept the pastoral charge of one of the largest churches in the diocese, but hitherto he had declined, alleging as a reason, his incapacity to assume such a responsi- bility. . Again. had the call been wafted over the blue waves of the mighty ocean, yet still he hesi- tated, until he was made to feel that his heavenly Father willed it. He was endeared to his little flock by many tender recollections, the sundering of which his kind heart shrunk from; but had not Abraham been called to leave his kindred, and go to a land he knew not, at the command of God--with his ready obedience the Lord was well pleased. He determined to go, trusting in the sacred promise "He that forsaketh houses or land for my sake shall receive a hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting." When his determination was announced to Flora, she immediately expressed a wish to a company the family. Were they not every thing to her in this world? had they not been instrumental in the con- version of her soul? To separate from them now- it would be impossible to realize any thing more dreadful. She would like to look upon the face of ,   8336      ARIAN  WALLACE. her beloved daughter, she would like to press her to her bosom; but that was, more than she dared to hope. Her brother had been kind-oh how kind!-yet she dared not breathe the wish; she would write, however, and state her desire to ac- company her friends to their new home. Every preparation which the limited means- of Mr. Barlow allowed, was made with the utmost dispatch, in order that they might escape the equi' j noctial gales. Mr. Leslie approved of his sister's wish to emigrate with Mr. Barlow, whom he es- teemed very sincerely as a gentleman and a Chris-. tian! Hle permitted Caroline to be folded in her parental arms. She had long mourned for a moth- er's love, from which she must now be separated just as she had been permitted to enjoy it. She. ultimately refused to be again separated from that beloved object, turning a deaf ear to all the argu- ments made use of, to deter her from her purpose. Her uncle was very much excited at Caroline's ob- stinacy, and reproached himself for ever permitting the interview. She contended so warmly, that it was her duty to remain with her amother, that at times he was almost persuaded to yield. But in yielding what a loss will she sustain, he thought; being young, she views not the honors of this world, which she so willingly renounces, as we do, who * * I              I   MARIAN WALLACE.        837 have received the adulation of its votaries. She sees not the lip of scorn turned with derision at the choice which she has made. "Oh that my sister had walked blameless before the Lord! then would her children have been a crown of glory, then would they have risen up and called her blessed." Caroline inherited the determination which char- acterized her father; any opposition seemed to stim- ulate her to redoubled exertions to accomplish her purpose. Her uncle yielded with the very best grace he could under the circumstances. Mr. Barlow set sail for the new world with his family and friends-for Caroline accompanied him. They encountered severe and continuous storms, by which they were driven entirely out of their course. After the fury of the storm had abated, they dis- covered the vessel to be in a deplorable condition- leaky and mastless. All hands went to work in order to stop the leak, but to no purpose; the vessel began to fill. Repeatedly the signal of distress was borne along the blue expanse, vibrating in mournful tones amid the breakers, which passed over the dis- abled ship. The booming gun sounded like a fu- neral knell. Calm and collected stood that man of God, gaz- ing on the mighty power of the elements, his wife pressed closo to his bosom. The children slept, per- 15   .      ..   338      , MARIAN  WALLACE. fectly unconscious of the danger by which they were  surrounded. Flora knelt with tearful eyes uplifted to the throne of grace, in behalf of her yet uncon-  verted child, whose frantic cries were lost amid the roar ofthe mighty ocean. The captain had given  r up all hope of safety, when a stentorian voice shout- ed: "A sail! a sail!"Oh how that word revived  their drooping energies! With fresh zeal they re- i doubled their exertions to keep the vessel afloat ;r until she was within hailing distance. Fearfully  were they agitated between hope and fear, lest their situation might not be discovered in time to save them from their perilous condition. Their joy knew.  no bounds, when they discovered that the vessel was  making all headway to reach them. Tears glistened in the eyes of those honest-hearted tars as they bore them gently and laid them on the deck, this being  the second vessel they and their gallant captain had i assisted since the recent storm. One of the passen- i gers taken from the burning Prometheus was so   i severely injured, that the captain feared he would  not survive until they reached port. All the rest ] were doing well, when our travellers were received  on board.  When the evening meal was ended Mr. Barlow  iL- requested the privilege of calling together as many ' as could be spared, that they might with him return  2   thanks for the preserving care, which had guarded them through the perils which they had so recently passed. Nor was the sufferer forgotten, who was unable to join them in their thanksgiving for the almost miraculous preservation. Thankful was that man of God, that his family circle remained un-. broken. Many of his fellow-passengers had lost all their friends; scarcely one but would find a vacant chair around his domestic hearth. Some had scarce- ly been able to save a change of raiment-among whom were 'Mr. Barlow and family. The captain very kindly offered to take them to England on his return, which would be when he had disposed of his cargo, and procured another for the English market. This Mr. Barlow thanked him for, but politely de- clined, as he felt anxious to reach New York.  The Prometheus, the vessel that had been de- stroyed by fire, -hailed from St. John's for Woolwich, with a detachment of the ninety-sixth regiment, which had been ordered home. High were the hopes which animated those gallant fellows, as they gazed on the white sails filled with the breeze waft- ing themn to their native land, from which they had been severed many years. Their hopes were des- tined never to be realized. The foam of the angry billows chanted their requiem; no winding-sheet shrouded their manly forms; no muffled drum, or                 , .   340     MARIAN WALL:ACE. farewell shot-nothing to mark where their com- rades were encircled by the cold billows, buried with the treasures of the deep, where gems sparkled in all their native brilliancy around their grave. Many fears were entertained that they would be obliged to consign another body to those coral beds; it was that of their colonel. Mr. Barlow read and prayed much with the sufferer, When he was able to converse. How clear was the faith which en- abled him to say: "If the earthly house of this tabernacle was dissolved, he had a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!"Htow much gratitude did he constantly express, that God had pardoned his sins before he was laid on a bed of languishing. How unable would he now have been to prepare to meet his God, racked with pain, de- prived of the use of his eyes, which, even if he re- covered, he almost feared would never be restored,  as he had been much injured by bruises about his head,                       I The sound of his voice fell familiarly on the ear i of Mr. Barlow, who sat trying to call to remem- brance when and where he had heard it.  Flora  and her daughter were standing at the foot of the cabin stairs, in earnest conversation. The sweetly- modulated tones reached the berth of the sick man,  the door of whose state-room opened directly op-  it   MARIAN  WALLACE.      841 posite to where they were standing. Breathlessly he listened to every word which fell from their lips. Mr. Barlow was startled by the sufferer's raising himself, with a strength almost superhuman in his present state, and exclaimed, "It is! It must be Flora! my own dear Flora!"Almost breathless she heard herself called. She entered the apart- ment. She, too, had recognized the voice which had called her. "Bristow!" was all she could say. Did it not speak volumes? Did it not declare to the sufferer that here, on the ocean's broad expanse, he had found the idol he was in search of, which nought but death could now separate. He felt that his simple name, pronounced by her lips, had imparted new life into his feeble frame. Heartily did the captain congratulate them on the recovery of their mutual friend. It had been more bene- ficial than all the medicine in the surgeon's locker. The joyful sound of land had interrupted the cap- tain's somewhat lengthy harangue. Away he went to issue his commands, preparatory to entering the harbor. Hospitably were they entertained by the wealthy inhabitants of New Orleans. Bristow received every attention which medical skill could devise, and, with such skillful nurses as Flora and Mrs. Barlow, it was not to be wondered at that his recovery was   342     MARIAN  WALLACE. rapid. None applied the lineament so gently to his wounds as she. No hand could smooth his pil- low so well as hers. The nauceous draught was quaffed cheerfully when administered by her; yet Flora was no longer the graceful, blooming sylph on which he had gazed in former years. She was a lovely, dignified matron, with a subdued expres- sion of sorrow, which, however, rather tended to  heighten the interest of her appearance. All who  gazed upon her countenance were charmed with  the extreme sweetness of its expression. Mr. Bar-  low had written, immediately on reaching port, to  the Bishop and vestry, stating his precise situation, and the name of the vessel in which passage had  ! been provided for himself and family, which was  now a total wreck, also his anxiety to reach his appointed place of destination as quickly as pos-  sible. Hie furthermore stated, that through the kindness of the captain, who had succored them, arrangements had been made to forward him and his family, free of expense, to New York. While Marian was performing her duties-which custom had familiarized her with-if not with cheer- fulness at heart, with alacrity-for she was too proud to make herself liable to the reproof of tardi-  ness, even if Mrs. Beaumont had been disposed to i find fault, which, we are happy to say, she was (,S   MARIAN  WALLACE.      343 not. Fanny was throwing the glittering sunbeams of her charms around Dr. Everet, who, though he remained perfectly indifferent to them, yet main- tained a friendly bearing towards her in the expec- tation that some thing might lead to the knowledge where Marian might be found. Many had been the secret but fruitless efforts which he had made to obtain the desired information. Like herself, too proud to ask a plain, staight-forward question, he left it to time and chance to work out the desire of his heart. Had he made the appeal to Fanny, who was as ignorant as of her locality as he was, how unsatisfactory would the information be? Not having heard any thing of her for years, she might be dead for any thing she knew or cared. All she dared she had accomplished-severed two de- voted to each other. Nor was she ignorant of the effect the knowledge of this had had on the victim, who, through their machinations, became Everet's wife. Marmaduke made her acquainted with all this. Still perseveringly did she cling, with a death-like tenacity, to the realization of her fondest dreams-that of ensnaring the dangler at her side into a commitment of himself. She assumed a most gentle and confiding manner when in the presence of a third person, yielding up her will in every thing with the sweetest ndivete. It was impossible   344     MARIAN  WALLACE. not to be flattered by such seeming condescension on her part. Man is always pleased with the hom- age woman renders. He applies the unction, con-, sidering himself the superior. But is it not doubly sweet, when he discovers her endowed with superior intellect, yet casting that aside, and resigning her- self entirely to his control.  While receiving these adulations in the most com- placent manner, with the affections of his heart cen- tred upon another, Everet was summoned to the bedside of a sick and suffering fellow being. It was in a comfortless room in one of our second- class hotels in the lower part of the city, that he found a female delirious with fever, contracted on board the vessel in which she had taken passage for this land of promise. Her language, though heard only in the ravings of delirium, bespoke her a person of superior education, and accustomed to refined society. "Who or what she was wasa mys- tery to Everet; his name was frequently on her lips, as also that of Flora, though he had never been familiarly acquainted with any one bearing that name. Vainly he endeavored to trace in her fea- tures a resemblance to any of the friends of his' youth. There was no other way to-account for her using his name, than by supposing she had heard it mentioned before she became delirious. This   MARIAN WALLACE.       345 was the conclusion he came to. While preparing the medicine he wished to be administered through the night, he was startled by hearing the stranger pronounce a name which thrilled through his frame. He could not be mistaken, for there it was again: "Find me Marian-Marian Wallace!"Could he be mistaken now? could he doubt his hearing? He set the medicine down, determined to remain with her through the night. But first it would be neces- sary to send word home where he was to be found. Ringing for the waiter, he handed him a card, with the name of the hotel and the number of the room where he was, and desired him to have it taken to his office. He then deliberately sat down to wait the issue of events, which he felt sure were about to be disclosed. Now did she roam over the enchanting grounds of Shirly Park; agaif did she pluck the daisy by the lagoon's bank; the forget-me-not, the primrose and the heather, were again analyzed, with the skill of one well versed in the science of botany-with Flora by her side. Everet sat and listened as one spell-bound. Then came the dying chamber of Mrs. Leslie, with all its horror and remorse;-that was but momentary, for it seemed to give the wretched woman pain. Again the scene changed. With the 'most consummate tact she led the unsuspecting 15   346     MARIAN  WALLACE. daughter of her patroness to the very verge .of the precipice, over which she so surely fell. It was Flora Leslie whose name was coupled with his own -a name he had scarcely ever heard breathed with aught but a sigh by his mother and aunt. And' was this the woman who had lured her unsuspecting feet to forsake the paths lof purity? What had this woman to do with Marian, who had left her native land almost a child-where the scenes which she spoke of were enacted? Why did she demand so anxiously to have her found? Was it remorse? had conscience sounded its alarm in disturbed vagaries of the mind? Reluctantly he left her to the care of the nurse provided for her by the proprietors of the hotel. It was impossible for him to remain, and neglect other important duties. On his way to his office he called on Mrs. Gamble, to solicit her assistance ,in unravelling the mystery, and have an oversight in her nursing, as he had reason to suppose her means were not at all limited. M]rs. Gamble was ready to co-operate with her son-in-law in all his undertakings, and cheerfully promised to comply- which very much relieved Everet; but his, mind remained occupied with the singularity of the cir- cumstance. He found it impossible to call again through the day; but he knew how good were the   MARIAN WALLACE.        347 hands he had placed her in, and if any change had taken place, he would have been immediately ap- prised. When he returned in the evening a note awaited him, stating that, upon the whole, his pa- tient had appeared rather more comfortable through the day. She had had lucid intervals of a few moments at a time, during which Mrs. Gamble al- most imagined she was recognized by her. She herself had discovered immediately on entering the room, that she was Miss Bankhead, of Shirly Park notoriety; but how she had made her way to this country, or for what purpose, it must be left to time to disclose, if her life should be spared. "I very much fear," added Mrs. Gamble, "that she is unfit to appear in the presence of her Maker." Everet hastened to relieve Mrs. Gamble from the tedium of the sick room, where she had no particu- lar interest-the natural goodness of her heart alone leading her to seek the suffering sons and daughters of humanity, in order to relieve them. While Everet's leisure moments were spent in listening to the moans of the wretched woman, his friends and the fashionable world were drinking in the words of a powerful and popular preacher who had appeared among them. Every morning he was asked if he had heard the eloquent Mr. Barlow- for it was he that was winning his way to all hearts.   348     MARIAN WALLACE. Everet replied that he had not, but intended doing- so at the earliest opportunity. "If you only knew what an intellectual feast you were to enjoy, you would no longer defer it," lisped a simpering young miss, on whom intellect had been very niggardly bestowed, never having been able to express an original sentiment. Everet did avail himself of the earliest opportu- nity. Breathless did a congregation of thousands hang upon the words of the speaker, as they fell in richly modulated tones upon their listening ears. Almost every eye was suffused with tears when he made his application of the truths which he had endeavored to expound. A lady who occupied the pew with: the doctor had politely handed him a prayer-book, which, at the end of the lessons, he closed, to return. Judge what was his astonishment on reading "Flora Leslie," in fine German letters, on the cover. Hle looked at the lady; she was young-far too young to be the lady of his romance; yet he determined to hazard an inquiry, the cir- cumstance seemlid so extraordinary.  At the close of the meeting, while waiting for the congregation to disperse-as did also the ladies in whom he had taken such a sudden interest--Everct addressed the one who had presented the book.   MARIAN WALLACE.        349 "Pardon me, madam," .said he, "do you bear the name which I see engraven here?" "No, sir; it is that of my mother." "Is that her looking towards her companion?" "No; that is Mrs. Barlow, the wife of the gentle- man whom you have just heard." Bowing to that lady, who appeared to act as the chaperon to the young girl, and handing his card at the same time, Everet said: "Do you think it possible that I could obtain an interview? It is of vital importance to herself that I should." "Mrs. Stanhope is in attendance on a sick friend. Would it not be better to make the request to my husband, whom I see vainly trying to reach us?" "Pardon my apparent impoliteness; but the fear of losing the opportunity caused me to overlook the proper mode of addressing strangers." "Yes, strangers, truly. We who are not yet acquainted with the etiquette of your society." By this time, Mr. Barlow had made his way to the place where his wife and her charge were stand- ing. Bowing graciously to the gentleman who was standing by their side, Everet made the same re- quest as he had done to his lady. "If you will walk with us, we -will talk the matter over, as I am that lady's guardian for the present."   850     MARIAN  WALLACE. The. doctor excused himself, but appointed the following evening, to which appointment he was punctual to the minute. In the mean time, Mr. Barlow had instituted an inquiry as to the. respect- ability of the gentleman, so that, on his arrival, he- was prepared to treat him with the utmost cor- diality. Everet stated the circumstances just as they had transpired, in relation to Mrs. Carleton; her anxiety to see Flora; his own belief that she had some disclosures to make that would be of in- finite service to that lady; and the request that Mr. Barlow .would co-operate with, and arrange matters satisfactorily to all interested. It is some- thing that cannot be postponed, as she lies in a precarious state. The agitation of her mind in- creases her danger, as she is of an exceedingly nervous and excitable temperament. When her paroxysms are at their height, it is awful. Mr. Barlow retired, and in a few moments returned, with Mrs. Stanhope leaning on his arm, who was formally introduced to Everet. He recapitulated the statement he had made to Mr. Barlow. Mrs. Stanhope became very much agitated during the recital, at the close of which she declared her readi- ness to accompany the doctor and Mr. Barlow to the bedside of the sufferer. "If she be only the bearer of my dear departed mother's pardon, how amply shall I be recompensed."    I         MARIAN  WALLACE.      351 While Everet was dispensing joy and gladness to the hearts of others, in his own their remained a void-a void which the restoration of Marian could alone fill. What if, when discovered, she should be the wife of another? True, she had not married Francis; yet he had no reason to suppose she would remain single, for the sake of one who was too proud to ask an explanation; nor had he any evidence that she regarded him with any thing but indifference, except the written testimony of his departed wife, who, it was not unlikely, had been misinformed; for those who had fabricated falsehood upon falsehood, had, probably, carried it through, by deceiving her in relation to the feel- ings Marian had entertained for him. Flora was shocked when brought into the pres- ence of Mrs. Carleton. She was not prepared for the ravages disease had made on the form of her preceptress, who, however, recognized her imme- diately. Earnestly did she entreat her forgiveness for the wrongs she had done, and feelingly were her entreaties responded to by Flora, who freely forgave her. They joined Mr. Barlow in prayer, during which the lips of the sufferer followed him. Everet brought this interview to a close, by stating that the strength of his patient was not adequate to its continuance. Flora wished to remain, but it was deemed advisable that she should not. All   352     MAxRIAN  WALLACE. retired together to the house of Mr. Barlow, where the mysterious ways of Providence were acknowl- edged. Being a physician, Everet was introduced to Bris- tow, whose sight, he thought might be materially benefited under the advice of an experienced ocu- list, and offered to introduce the best the city af- forded, a personal friend of his own. Crystal drops coursed down the cheeks of Flora, as Everet made his adieus, promising to call and take her friend' on the following day, which he accordingly did. The oculist gave him every encouragement to hope for the entire restoration of his sight. Everet became a frequent visitor at the house of Mr. Bar- low, to whom he introduced Mrs. Gamble, who was much pleased with the lady portion of the family, especially with Caroline, who, in many things, reminded her of her dear departed Louisa. At this lady's house she met Francis, who was much pleased-more than he was willing to ex- press-with that lovely girl, who evinced so much fortitude and maternal love as to throw aside all the pleasures which wealth could bestow, to reside with her mother, not in want, but in retirement, and from whom she had been separated since child- hood. Mrs. Barlow was much pleased with American 'i   MARIAN  WALLAC]E.      853 ladies, and society in general. Wherever she had been introduced, she was treated with marked at- tention. Feeling herself to be no longer the 'wife of an obscure country curate, but the helpmate of one whose talents were of the highest order we must excuse this lady if she evinced some pride as she gazed upon the father of her children, and recognized in him the greatest pulpit orator of the day. But, without vital religion-which she knew him to possess-what would all the honors of the world avail? True, he might leave an untarnished name to posterity. 'Would not the sweet-smelling savor of a quiet walk and a well-ordered conversa- tion, be a far more desirable legacy to bestow? Fanny, tired of 'displaying her charms where they were unappreciated, turned her attention to a different quarter. As she had long since dis- covered it was impossible to captivate Everet by them, she brought all her bright artillery to bear upon the rather weak-minded Francis, who had forsaken Miarian when danger threatened. He was the last of her sunshine friends, and, probably, the most regretted. Could she not say, with the poet: "What is friendship' but [a name, A charm that lulls to sleep, A shade that follows wealth and fame, But leaves the wretch to weep?"   354        MARIAN WALLACE. CHAPTER XXII. "Oh love! how are thy precious moments Thus ever cross'd, thus vexed with disappointments. Now pride, now fickleness, fantastic quarrels, And sullen coldness, give us pain by turns. Malicious meddling, chance, is ever busy To bring us fears, disquietude, and delays; And even at last, when, after all our waiting, Ere we think to snatch the dear-bought love, Ambition calls us to its sullen cares, And honor stern impartial of neglect,  Commands us to forget our ease and pleasure." ROWE'S ULYSSES. WHEN the superior charms of Caroline Stanhope burst upon the vision of Francis, with all her youth- ful loveliness, Fanny, poor Fanny, was left to hang her harp upon the willow, and, to add to her cha- grin, Marmaduke     was  playing   the  agreeable   in another quarter.     Great was    the  mortification   of Fanny Graham-the Fanny who had swayed all hearts.   Evening   after evening   was she obliged    to spend  in  the  solitude  of her own    clamber-,she, the gay, the fascinating, the gifted, could find none willing  to be  her escort.    What a   mortification!   MARIAN  WALLACE.       355 and how richly Marmaduke enjoyed it. Her able friend and coadjutor, Mrs. Sydney, had long since stepped from the stage of fashion, in society, her husband having been detected in embezzling money, and appropriating it to his own use.  His wife, being cognizant of the matter, was considered the more guilty of the two, as her extravagance, it was said, had lead to his fall. The last time Mrs. Gamble heard from her kind- hearted friend the captain, he had retired to the quiet of a well-stocked farm, the ultima thule of a sailor's ambition, which, however-if he ever at- tains it-he soon wearies of, and "Backward he flies to her billowy breast, Like a bird that seeketh its mother's nest;" so that it would not be surprising if he should again visit our shores. If ever he does, gladly shall we greet his weather-beaten face, which is but the index of his heart. Mrs. Gamble lived to see her children's children frolic by her side. Mrs. Graham was gathered to her fathers, and Fanny was left undisputed pos- sessor of the wealth she so much coveted. When Marmaduke thought she was sufficiently punished, he offered himself and was accepted; she dreading to pass through life in the state of single blessedness.   856     MARIAN WALLACE. Affectionately and earnestly, and not unfrequent- ly, did Mr. William Leslie urge the return of Caro- line to Shirly Park. Flora's nurse had bequeathed him a legacy, in the person of her grandchild, the ddaughter of Flora's foster sister, whom she would have to wait upon her. But Caroline had the at- tendance of one more congenial to her mind-the devoted Benjamin Francis, who lived but in her smiles, and to whom she expected, on some day at no great distance, to plight her troth, with the ap- probation of her mother, and her beloved Mr. Bar- low. Mr. Gamble, senior, was fast hastening to the bourne from whence no traveller returns. Dissipa- tion had done its work; he was reaping the rewards of the deeds done in the body. While he was pass- ing away, with a frame weighed down with the wages of sin, Miss Harvey's glorified spirit, which had been made perfect through tribulation, was winging its way through the regions of the upper air, where the redeemed of the Lord welc uled her released soul, from the earthly coil which had so long enthralled her. Mrs. Everet and her daughter were with her when she exchanged time for eternity. They mourned not when the aged pilgrim departed, to lay her crown at the Saviour's feet. The greater part of Flora's time was spent in   tj    *  bMARIAN WALLACE.       357 ministering to the wants of the two invalids, Mrs. Carleton and Bristow. The latter had so far recov- ered as to be able to distinguish between night and day. Everet was still- unsuccessful in all his efforts to discover Marian, whom Mrs. Carleton anxiously de- sired to find, in orde:i to put into her hands the trust which was reposed in her by one who was now no more, and to whom she had faithfully promised to fulfil her dying request, without having the remotest idea of complying. Sickness, and the near approach .of that mighty conqueror who frustrates our unlaw- ful desires by laying his icy hand upon our persons, summoned her, however, to restore to the rightful owner the ill-gotten gains which she had so long withheld. Joy diffused itself around a large number of i'iends, when it was announced that Mrs. Beau- mont and family had returned from their tour on the continent. Long had they lingered in Florence; for months had they domesticated themselves in an old -chateau on the banks of the Arno.-What a gloriouis vision bursts upon the eye- of the traveller, as he beholds Florence. The lofty mountains, with their luxuriant vineyards, in elegant repose on the banks of the Arno.  Here did they linger, loth to leave scenes' calculated to inspire and elevate the  858     MARIAN  WALLACE. mind; and here had Marian lingered; here had she sought to school her heart to bear with fortitude every vicissitude which she might be called to pass through; here had she wandered amid its palaces, its churches, and its galleries, for which it is so celebrated. Well may Florence be called the beau- tiful. Marian had returned to her adopted home with an enlarged understanding; she was grateful for the opportunity which had been afforded her for improvement. Mrs. Beaumont felt anxious that Marian should renew acquaintances which had been formed under favorable auspices-some whom she had met abroad, that lady considered of very great importance to the future advancement of her pro- tegee, and for this purpose she became urgent that Marian should take the earliest opportunity, on their arrival. Marian reluctantly obeyed the mandate of her friend, whose motive she appreciated; but her spirit was inadequate to the effort of again mix- ing with the world, and perhaps meeting Louisa, the happy wife of Everet-being entirely unin- formed as to what had taken place during her ab: sence. It was impossible to give a sufficient reason for her love of retirement, without awakening sus- picions in the mind of her friend as to the true cause. Marian had no desire to enlighten the world   MARIAN WALLACE.        359 as to her disappointmlent, and the sorrow she had endured. She left home with feelings any thing but amiable. She had paid her respects, and was about retiring, when a visitor was announced, whose name thrilled witl unspeakable anguish through her frame -a name whose talismanic influence had power to discompose the stoical indifference she usually pos- sessed. There was no egress by which she could escape the meeting through wlich she must pass. No; she must meet him as a stranger, in the pres- ence of strangers. (Oh that I had not been in- duced to make this hateful visit!" said she to her- self, "how much I should have escaped!"But no; she must see him, and hear him speak. Yes; Ev- eret was again in her presence. With a beating heart and a blanched cheek, she went through the form of an introduction to one whom she once fondly loved. She, however, had the advantage of being some moments in his presence before he recognized her. That advantage was gained by the fashionable shade of the room, which makes objects rather indistinct on first entering. During these moments Marian had time to collect her scattered thoughts, and compose herself, in order that she might act with becoming dignity. She had remained as long as politeness demanded, after his entrance. Rising to make her exit, she   360     MARIAN  WALLACE. was prevented by the lady's directing her attention to a painting which she had just purchased. It was a view of Venice, with its seventy-five islands and five hundred bridges, and as she had just returned from the city of gondolas, she would probably be a good judge of the correctness of a representation which the lady said she admired very much, and for which she had given a large sum. Politeness de- manded that Marian should appear interested; step- ping across the room to look at the painting, Everet had an opportunity to examine more critically the face which had interested him. "Marian!" he exclaimed in an agitated voice, "do I again behold you?-you whom I had given up as lost." When he advanced to meet her, she shrank back with the modest grace and graceful confusion which is so enchanting in the female character. She re- collected their relative position, and was silent. He took her hand with respect. He was touched with the manifest languor which appeared. She bore the signs of long-continued ill-health; yet, never had she appeared so interesting as at this moment. Both were altered. Both felt it was for the better. There was a cold and affected restraint in the meet- ing of the two so closely united by the bonds of   MARIAN  WALLACE.      361 sympathy and feeling, and so similar in taste and intellect. "Long years have passed since we met, Marian," said Everet, "but, during those long years, I have borne in remembrance those happy days in the house of our friend Mrs. Graham." "They were, indeed, happy," replied Marian; "we were both younger; and had seen less of the world. More gloomily hav6 they passed since." "Marian!" exclaimed Everet, "cannot the orig- inal purity and happiness of those days be again realized? Cannot the days of hope and joy re- turn?" Everet poured forth the long-concealed and deep feelings of his heart. Marian was bewildered.  "Everet," said she, "such language is unbecoming in you to express, and in me to listen to. The relationship which we sustain does not warrant such sentiments of regard as you have just expressed. You long since selected one every way worthy and suitable to be your partner. If no respect dwells in your heart for me, at least respect her who bears your name." Everet had forgotten, in the impetuosity of his feelings, that Marian might be uninformed as to what changes had taken place in her absence. Her manner of addressing him convinced him' that such was the case. 16   362     MARIAN  WALLACE. "Marian, I have the sanction of my departed wife. It was her sincere desire that I should make known to you the state of my mind, after a suitable time had expired. Will you listen? May I not plead my cause?  May that pleading not be in vain! Do I, can I still find a place in your heart? Can those cheerful, happy days not return?" "Everet, I must have time, time to collect my wandering thoughts." "Marian, had you ever loved me as fondly as I once thought, what time, think you, would be necessary to discover what your heart had long experienced?" Had Marian yielded to her feelings, she would have thrown herself into the arms of Everet, and acknowledged how fondly she had loved, and still loved him. But reason forbade the act. She would compromise herself. lie should never know how fondly she loved him, or how sincerely she had mourned the loss of his affection. How could she tell him all she had suffered for his sake? Hlow was she to know that he was any more sincere now than formerly? What reason had she ever given him to treat her as he had done? Marian had learned to doubt the profession of the world. She had learned to doubt even the evidence of her own senses. This state of feeling was foreign   MARIAN  WALLACE.      363 to her trusting heart. Her confidence had been shaken in man. Her trust had been betrayed, from which she had not yet recovered. Was she, there- fore, prepared to take the wanderer back, to re- instate him in her affections, on first intimating such a desire? No. The pride of her nature re- belied; pride sustained her from yielding. Rather than be surprised into a surrender on the first at- tack, she prepared for flight. "Pardon me, Doctor Everet. You, probably, are not aware that my time is not altogether at my disposal. I must, therefore, wish you good morn- "ng." '"Marian, not until you have told me where I shall be able to find you. Think you I will resign one whom I have sought with such avidity?" I Marian then told him where she resided, and gave him the number of Mrs. Beaumont's residence. Everet waited upon her, loth to be separated from his new-found treasure, requesting permission to call in the evening. In his hurry to announce the pleasing intelligence to Mrs. Carleton, (who was i  residing at present with Mrs. Gamble,) many of his patients were forgotten. Iow sincere were their congratulations! his happiness was theirs. Mrs. Gamble loved himy as a son, and he loved and esteemed her as though she were his own moth- i   364     MARIAN  WALLACE. er. Mrs. Carleton's gratitude was unbounded; she regarded him as her deliverer; there was no enco- mium loud enough to speak his praise. Next to Mr. Barlow, who was her spiritual adviser, such a being did not exist on the face of the earth as Everet. So much trouble as it must have cost him to trace Marian, in order that her mind might assume a peaceful, healthy tone. Poor Mrs. Carleton did not know how necessary she was to Everet's happiness; she supposed he had sought her out merely to re- lieve her mind from the intolerable burden by which it was weighed down. It was with the utmost difficulty Everet could arrange his toilet satisfactorily, to suit the fastidious taste which he knew Marian to possess. Having paid very little attention to his toilet since the death of his wife, vests and pants lay in confused masses on every available seat; boots, shoes and hair- brushes, appeared in close proximity, to the un- speakable annoyance of the chambermaid, who was the personification of neatness. Never had the doc- tor's room appeared such a scene of confusion. She knew something dreadful must have happened to her master. With a beating heart Marian hastened to obey the summons to meet a gentleman who wished to see her in the library. The doctor led Marian to a seat,   MARIAN WALLACE.       365 and took one himself by her side. They had much to relate, and many things to explain. They dwelt long on the perfidy of Fanny, who was now reaping sorrow in her union with Marmiaduke, who had be- come a confirmed inebriate. Her wealth was fast dwindling away; not a pittance secure to keep her from actual want. "And now, Marian," said Everet, "when shall I claim the hand of her whom I have long loved? Let the probation be short. Why this silence? Am I indifferent to you?" "It is not from indifference that I remain silent. Why raise hopes which I fear never can be realized?" "And why not, Marian?  What earthly power can separate us now? Nothing is necessary to our union but your consent. Why withhold it?" "By withholding it, Everet, I do what under the circumstances I consider to be right. Everet, you are proud, proud of birth and station. When you first wooed and won my affections, reputation at- tached wealth to my name. How much you were influenced by such rumor I pretend not to assert; 'your subsequent conduct convinced me that it had itseffect. Hear me, Everet. Never will I give you my hand unless a fortune accompanies it." "Marian, you are unjust. I never sought you for your wealth Heaven is my witness." A   366     MARIAN  WALLACE. "Everet, I have the testimony of Francis to cor- roborate what I assert." "Francis never could have told such a premedi-  tated falsehood; he must have misunderstood my words. I remember perfectly stating that a wife with money or influence was extremely essential to my future advancement. I did not evince such a mercenary spirit in my choice of a wife: she brought me nothng."        , The tone of his voice sounded harsh as he uttered , this sentiment.                  i "Dr. Everet," replied Marian, "I merely wish to - undeceive you. You have returned and evinced a  desire to renew the intimacy of former years. You  find me surrounded by wewlth which I have no  right to enjoy. Appearances are deceptive. Ev-  eret, I am but a hireling, enjoying the favor, of those  who employ me, so long as I perform faithfully all  known requirements. Knowing the pride of your  heart shrinks from being allied to one who serves in i the capacity I do-cheerfully will I shield you from  sucl odium, cheerfully do I relinquish all claim to i your addresses, inheriting as I do the same amount  of pride with yourself." "Is there no other obstacle to our union, Ma-  rian     ,   .         -  "None. Had I a fortune to lay at your feet I ?i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      367 should feel that day to be the proudest of my life when I resigned it to your keeping; but for me that day will never arrive." Everet smiled his own peculiar smile. "Marian," said he, "that day is nearer at hand than you have any anticipation of." "What mean you, Everet? Surely you cannot be so cruel as to mock my distress." 'Marian, I would not pain you for the world. I would not add a sorrow to the already accumu- lated load. Read this, and judge for yourself," said Everet, taking a letter from his pocket. This testified to receiving money and jewels to a large amount, in trust for Marian Wallace, the adopted daughter of the late Mrs. Mortimer; which said legacy would be forthcoming in person or by letter. Signed, Julia Carleton. "What say you, Marian, to that precious docu- ment?" "That it is all a ruse of yours, Everet. Who in this world would bequeath any thing of the kind to me? I have not a relative or friend in the world, to my knowledge." "And are there none who ought before leaving the world to make restitution for wrongs committed against you?" "No, Everet. All who are gone loved and were   368     MARIAN WALLACE. kind, with the exception of Mrs. Leslie, who I have long since forgiven, and to whom I was ever a way- ward and petulant child, when I ought to have been gentle and conciliatory. Oft when earth's dark sor- rows pressed heavily, have I sighed at the recollec- tion of my juvenile delinquencies. It would be presumption in me to suppose that she remembered me with any thing but abhorrence."  "That she did remember you in a much more  satisfactory manner you have unmistakable proofs, now in the hands of Mrs. Carleton, which she is anxious to deliver to the right owner in the person of yourself. She is now on a visit at my house, as the guest of Mrs. Gamble, who has taken up her  ! abode permanently with me, since the death of her  husband, and who I shall still expect to reside with i me, independent of any changes which may event-  ually transpire."  Mrs. Carleton sought and obtained the desire of : her heart, a home with Flora Stanhope, soon to be- come Flora Bristow, his health being fully re-estab- '  lished, and the blessing of sight again restored, for . which Flora was thankful. This affliction would not ? have deterred her, however, from joining her fate  with his. She would be eyes for him, would she meekly say, when spoken to on the subject. They were spared the trial, however, and they only wait-  *.    .     1   '    !  i   MARIAN  WALLACE.      369 ed the return of Mr. Barlow to perform the cere- mony, he having been called away to his native home to settle the affairs of a wealthy relative, who, having died childless, left him the bulk of his prop- erty. There was rejoicing in the family of Mrs. Beau- mont, on the accession to Marian of wealth and hap- piness. They had long seen that she was unhappy; but when they looked upon her blooming face, as she now appeared, could they ever suppose she had been a child of sorrow? Here and there you might see a thread of premature old age, which Everet would smilingly declare he was chargeable with. She, too, became impatient for Mr. Barlow's return. Francis declared it to be preposterous to keep such an interesting trio in such suspense; but each bride had declared her determination to be united by no other. We know not how Marian became her new-found position, but this we do know, that the prayer of the righteous availed in her behalf, and that, amid all her trials and difficulties, there was ever found a way of escape.
