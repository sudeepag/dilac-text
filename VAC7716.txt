WHERE IS UTOPIA?
!Heart-sick and weary of this life,
With all.its envyings, toils and strife,
A Poet cried, "I'll cease to look
Upon the pages of this book :
These cannot tell me what I ask-
They are of mortal brains the task :
They, all, from wisdom widely stray,
Or point, at best, the longest way."
And, saunt'ring forth, he gazed abroad
'On all the beauteous works of God,-
Where deepest azure dyes the sky,
And jewels rare resplendent lie:-
Tall mountain peaks and valleys deep
In the dim distance seemed to sleep.
Still, lost in wonder most profound
As he lay stretched upon the ground,
He heeded not the night-wind's breath,
As, cold and chill, it spoke of death,
'Till, damp with midnight dew; his hair
Was blown across his brow so fair.
With hasty step he gained a chair
Secluded from the damp, chill air;
And, as the northwind whistled by,
Hear him in his anguish cry:
" Softly, gentle zephyrs, fan me,
Lightly press my fevered brow ;
My spirit bends before the tempest,
Like some rudely shaken bough.

 WHERE IS      UTOPIA?
Linger sweetly ever near me,
Gently press my aching brain,
Let me feel thy soothing presence
Sweetly lulling every pain.
0, the spirit's weary longing
For some isle of peace unseen
And the fairy visions thronging
Of a land that's evergreen,-
Land of mrytle and pimento,
Lemon and banana bowers,-
Sweetly light-winged zephyrs fan me
With the breath of tropic flowers !
Come to me with perfume laden,
Gathered 'mid the orange groves,
Bring the breath of far-off Eden,
Where no chill wind ever roves;
Tell me of that land elysian-
Whisper softly in my ear:
I long to find the famed Utopia,-
Tell me, can I find it, there ?
I wait, impatient for an answer,
It comes in sighing soft and low,
" I come, responsive to your longing,
The glories of my land to show.
There the flowers.are ever blooming,
And richest perfumes on the breeze
Are ever floating, ever roaming,
O'er orange groves and verdant leas."
He had stood, in days of yore,  .
In Rome, rich in historic lore;
And ruins gray and missed by time
Had charmed our wand'ring son of rhyme,
Through temples and imperial halls,
Once echoig proudest monarch's calls,

If

WHERE IS UTOPIA?
O'er tombs of men of great renown
Had pondered on their glory gone,
Had strolled up to the Pincian Hill
At sunset hour, so calm, so still
The day-god sinking-in the west,
Tinging the distant mountain's crest,
While all around a golden light
Lingered, as loth to quit the sight.
Below, the city, ancient Rome;
Beyond the Tiber, St. Peter's dome
In stately grandeur rose to view
Against a sky of cloudless blue.
Unbroken stillness reigned around,
Save by the fountain's lulling sound,
Singing, he thought, a hymn of praise
For that most beautiful of days.
Much more of beauty met his view
In that land so old,. yet new.
Italia, in her gala dress !
Sure, her sons must all be blest.
But no, what means those tattered ones?
They cannot be Italia's .sons.
That maiden with the outstretched palms,
And humid eyes, she begs for alms.
Too true, Utopia cannot be
Where dwell thy pangs, dread Poverty.
He travelled many weary miles,
Nor heeded he proud beauty's smiles,
From land to land, with weary limb,
And-throbbing brow, and eyes oft dim.
Beaut'ful Venice met his gaze,
A glad smile drove his gloom apace.
Bright stars dancing in the water,
Fit gems for earth's queenly daughter,
The songs of merry gondoliers
Fell soothingly upon his ears ;
While the soft dipping of the oar,

WHERE IS UTOPIA?

So calming after ocean's roar,
Lulled his tired soul to sweet repose,
Nor roused he till King Sol arose.
Then with his mind from languor clear,.
He entered a gondola near,
Which, darting as a fish at play,
Traversed many a winding way.
Fully employed were ears and eyes
With rapture, 'till the Bridge of highs,
Loomed up before him, awful grand.
The halls of inquisition stand
Gloomily before him now,
While great drops stand upon his brow.
He turned, and sighing, sought no more-
Utopia on a foreign shore,     I
But turned him to hxs own fair land,
Where all men free and equal stand ;
Her beauties long he had passed by,
Though much she claims to charm the' eye.
We'll transport him to his Eden,
Where each breath with perfume laden,
By Welaka's beauteous stream
Lay him gently down to dream.
Softly do the zephyrs now
Lift the light locks from his brow,
Healthful breezes sighing low,
The long moss swaying to and fro,
Rich magnolia buds so white,
Whose perfume fill him with delight;'
From the live-oak branches near
Hark ! the mock-bird's note so clear;
O'er him bends an orange bough,
Almost kissing his pale brow.
He starts, what means that jarring sound
Close to his ears? Up from the ground
He leaps ! ' Ah ! look, he's just in time,
One moment and he'd done with rhyme.

:7

The rattlesnake with venomed fang
Darts past, and, harmless, strikes the sand.
Our Poet stands and stares aghast ;
Hear him, he's gained his speech at last.
"Gentle zephyr, softly sighing,
Deluding mortals with thy breath !
O land so fair, with Eden vieing,
Why lurks amid thy flowers grim death ?
Here I could live and dream forever,
I love thee, 0 most beauteous land!
But this is not the famed Utopia,-
I cannot with vile reptiles stand.
India's breath is not more balmy,
Italia's sky is not more clear,
O this southern land so palmy,-
Florida, so 'bright, so dear !
Can I find a spot where nature
Rules with mild and gentle sway?
A place where every living creature
Lives in peace and harmony ?
Somethingewhispers deep within me,
As all things around me show,
Nothing here can ease.these longings,
No place is free from mortal woe.
The Poet mind is ever roving,
Seeking bliss on earth in vain ;
Utopia-is a fond chimera,
Living but in the Poet's brain.

SHAD OWS.
SHADOWS.

o the shadows; how they gather.
In my lonely room to-night!
All the faces of my loved ones,
Bringing with them past delight.
o ye shades of loved ones, linger!
Cheer me, sad and lone to-night.
Happy childhood's friends area near me-
Brothers four, a noble band,
Gathered round a father's hearthstone,-
Young and innocent they stand :
Father, mother, sister, brothers!-
Alas ! alas! a broken band !
One by -one the band is scattered,
Out into the world they go ;
One by one - 0 how we miss them!,
Yet we know it must be so.
Could my arms once more enfold them,
Never would I let them go.

But the shadow sweetest, saddest,
Is the mem'ry of my love;
Dreams of bliss too soul-entrancing,
Rivalling the joys above:
In the dust all soiled and trampled
Lies the idol of my love.
Go, ye shadows, though ye leave me
Prostrate on the grave of hope!

THE DYING YEAR.
Love, your mem'ry has unnerved me
Back ! I would not call you up.
Leave me, peace-destroying, shadows,
Let me pray for strength and hope.

THE -DYING       YEAR.
The poor old year is weak and weary,
Lay him gently down, to rest ;
His death is sad, and cold and dreary,
Fold his hands upon his breast.
Speak of him in tones of kindness,
Let his good remembered be:
All his faults, his sins, his blindness,
Pass into obscurity.

All the heartaches he has given,
All the groans, the sighs, the tea:
The bonds of love and friendship ri
Buried with his hopes and fears,
Poor old year ! His weight of sorro
And regret cannot be known,
By the youth who comes to-morrow
Till twelve months are past and
Ali ! Old Year ! thy reign was fleet
Yet 'tis marred by sad regret;-
While his bright successor greeting
There is much we would forget.
The clouds above his bier are weepi
Mingled tears of grief and joy-
Grief for him who here lies sleeping
Joy for to-morrow's bright-eyed b

BY-GONE       HOURS.
BY-GONE HOURS.
A vision bright of by-gone hours
Is o'er my mind now stealing ;
So plain it seems - the buried-past
So true in its revealing,
Methinks I'm living o'er again
Those happy, transient hours
When life was all one blissful dream,
Its pathway strewn with flowers.
My happy heart more quickly beats
At sight of some loved token,
Or when perchance by one dear voice
Some kindly word is spoken.
I feel again warm friendship's clasp,
And love's low tone is breathing
Into my willing ear, and life's
For me bright garlands wreathing.
THE CLINGING IVY.
We read of ivy clinging
Around some giant tree,
Poets are ever singing
Its faith and constancy.
0, 'tis very dutiful,
This clinging love and trust!
And it sounds so beautiful,
Believe it all we must.

THE   CLINGING IVY.                   17
Our own fair mother, Nature,
Has many varying dyes ;
Some trees of giant stature,
And some of dwarfish size;
Some trees bear blossoms only,
Some full of golden fruit,
Some isolated, lonely,
Leaves but their scanty suit,,
Standing alone, defying
The wintry wind and storm,
With their sad, mournful sighing,
But proud, unbending form.
To these no ivy clinging
To beautify and bless,
Only the solemn singing
Of weary, sad unrest.
Where warmth and beauty glowing
With colors rich and rare,
And naught unsightly growing,
The harmony to mar,
Some tall, proud oak is swaying
Its limbs before the breeze;
Though inwardly decaying,
'Tis monarch of the trees.
'Mid luxury and beauty,
And soil rich and warm,
Not difficult 'the duty
To cling to that proud form.
So up the ivy creeping
With timid love and trust,
'Till the rude tempest sweeping,
Low lays it in the dust.
Behold it prostrate lying,
Crushed by its idol's fall,
Clinging still, though dying,
To its love like a pall.

MY BIRTHDAY.

Poor Ivy ! dying lonely,
This sad truth well may show,
The fondest heart can only
Be by its love brought low.

MY BIRTHDAY.

My birth-day,! Darkly roll the shadows
Which obscure the king of day,'
And from gloomy clouds are dripping
Rain-drops soft as foot of fay.
Softly, lightly as they're falling,
Hardly press they on my heart,
For the dark and gloomy shadows
Of my being form a part.
And they must continue onward,
Onward through the coming years-
Storm and cloud and gloomy darkness,-
Never ceasing fount of tears,
All in one sjiort life are crowded-
Must this year nojoy contain-?
Must the shadows still go onward -
Lowering clouds and dripping rain?
Will the months bring me no gladness?
Is there naught on earth for me?
Naught for me but pain and sadness ?
Saviour, give me rest in Thee ;
Give me strength for each to-morrow,
Disappointment's sting remove ;
I will not ask surcease of sorrow,-
Only guide me by Thy love.

THE DAISY'S SE1M ON.

THE DAISY'S SERMON.
Life's cares, so heavy and real,
To earth seemed bearing me down;
'The years were bringing me ever
The cross, and never the crown.
Against a tall forest monarch
I leaned, in heaviest woe ;
My thoughts I tried to turn upward,
My eyes would wander below.
The earth with dead leaves covered,
Which the chill winds whirled around,
Was all-no, not all, for yonder
Was a green, moss-covered mound.
I pressed my hot cheek upon it,
'Twas as velvet, soft and green,
And, there, as chiding my sorrow,
A Daisy bud peeped between.
Though chill winds whistled around it;
Or sighed through bare boughs above,
Its mild eyes were raised to heaven,
Bright, smiling with trust and love.
It seemed to speak with sweet chiding,
" There's work for me and'for you ;
Learn, then, through all to be patient,
He gives but what we can do."

MY DESTINY.
MY   DESTINY.
I live upon a frozen sea,
My little bark icebound ;
My vision sweeps nor rock nor lee,-
No hope of aid is found,
Around, above, on every side-
All,-ocean, air and sky-
Stirred by no breath of summer tide :
0 God ! could I but die.
The seasons all alike to me,
No mild breeze fans my cheek,
No balmy breath from land or sea
These frozen regions seek.
An iceberg hoary by my side
Has stood for years and years,
Chilling affection's gentle tide,
Freezing the fount of tears.,
It tells me that my doom is sealed,
I cannot flee away:
0 God ! my very blood's congealed,
By this my destiny !
I pray, my agonizing crits
Fall back unheard to me,
They cannot pierce the leaden skies
All frozen like the sea.
I dreamed the sun so genial, bright,
Had shed its rays on me,
My little bark was dancing light
Upon a thawing sea;

I love, this calm sweet hour,
To sit and gaze abroad

2

A VESPER HYMN.
Before me warmth and beauty lay,
A sweet hope lured me on,
My eyes were on the god of day,-
0, joy would come anon!
But, no. A cold and cruel fate
Has said " this cannot be ;
The iceberg cold shall be your matex
You never can be free."
'Tis better that no sunlight warm
Should shine upon my way,
'Tis better hope should never charm
Sweet feelings into play.
For 0, this monster grim and high
Which looms beside my path,
Is ready, and is ever nigh
To bury me beneath
The chilling waves. 'Tis toppling o'er,
And threatening as is wrath :
O Fate ! I yield, I shun no more
This living, breathing death !
A VESPER HYMN.
The sun is low declining
From lowland, vale and rill;
Its last faint rays are shining
On tree-top, spire and hill;
And twilight hour is creeping,
With its sweet and silent tread;
And the star of eve is peeping
Out from its azure bed.

On nature, lovely nature,
And think of nature's God.
I love to sit and ponder
On the works of his dear hand,
And then, by faith to wander
Into the promised land.'
I see those fields Elysian
Where Christ dwells with his own ;
I see the blessed river
Proceeding from the throne;
I see the Crown of Glory,
To which all else is dim.
Father, I bow before Thee,
Breathing my vesper hymn.
I LOVE THEE.
By those azure orbs so bright,
By their blue, ethereal light,
By thy form of heavenly mold,
By thy pure and stainless soul,
By thy brow transparent, fair,
By thy mind's deep treasures rare,
By thy voice of melody,
Hear me whisper-I love thee.
By that air so free from art,
By thy tender, loving heart,
By those;tears that freely flow
For another's grief and woe:
Lady fair, Oh! hear my vow,
I will love thee e'er as now,
Only whisper now to me
Sweetly, truly-I love thee.

THE BEAUTIFUL BEYOND.
There must be  ay, there is a life
Beyond the toils, the ills of this -
Beyond the heart-ache and the strife -
A place of pure, unending bliss !
O that beautiful, bright beyond !
I know that when this life shall end,
My poor lone heart, so sad, so fond,
Shall never feel it needs a friend.
Life is not long ; I will be brave.
With strength from that bright world above,
My soul shall triumph o'er the grave,
My heart be fired with holy love.
Ay, 'tis not long ! I'll work and wait,
My recompense will surely come ;
God rules my fortune, 'tis not fate,
And he will give me friends and home.
A DREAM.
Yesternight as I lay dreaming
Of the time to come,
Visions, rainbow-tinted, gleaming,
Of my future home,
Whispered, though with sorrow teeming,
Life will lose its gloom.
Hope, the mind's best offspring, dancing
Bright before my eyes,


24        A DREAM.

Says, " Earth's sorrows but enhancing
Joys of Paradise."
Lord, I hear these words entrancing,
"Love, there, never dies."
Blest assurance, care dispelling,
Leaves no room for fears;
Future joys my bosom swelling,
Fill mine eyes with tears
Tears from pleasure's fountain welling,
-Drowning myriad tears.
While I lay thus sweetly dreaming,
Shone a ray so bright,
Of that Light, the world redeeming
From its long, dark night :
And the white-robed host proclaiming,
"Hail the King of Light !"
Then on angel pinions pending,
I was borne along,
Onward, upward, still ascending
'Mid a countless throng ;
Harps and voices sweetly blending
In a joyous song.
Upward, yet still upward flying,
Even to the throne,
Where the unnumbered host are vieing
Each to see the Son;
Him, the blest, who for us dying,
For us glory won.
The vision's passed away, and leaving
Me to this dull earth,
Regardless of my bosom's heaving
For the heavenly birth;
Yet my mind sweet thoughts is weaing,
Of bright heaven's worth.

A LOVING .HEART.,

It mustabe sweet to feel
That one good, noble heart is true,
That one there is to kneel
And offer heartfelt prayers for you;
That, though the world may scoff and blame,
One heart through all is still the same.
It must be sweet to know
Of all the world one thinks you fair,
And loves you well, although
Your brow be shadowed o'er with care,
Though slander's deeply.venomed breath
May haunt you till you pray for death.
How much of untold grief
One loving voice can chase away !
How sweet the kind relief
From lips that pleasant words can say !
Methinks 'twere even sweet to die
With such a being hovering nigh.
It is -it must be sweet
To reign in one pure heart alone;
Whatever fate you meet,
To know that heart is still your own
Though every other tie be riven,
To such ecstatic joy is given.

Written for and read before the Teachers' Institute at Buckingham Court House,
Virginia, August, 172.
EDUCATE THE CHILDREN.
Desolation and want brood over our land,
Gaunt poverty greets us on every hand,
Our energies crippled; enervating care
Unfits us life's wearisome burden to bear.
Too long we have yielded to impotent grief;
The years, from oppression, bring us no relief.
Let us up and be doing, shake off each weight,
And rise above trouble, defiant of fate.
There are many immortals crowding us now,
They are mentally starving, while, passive we bow
To tyranny's yoke. Let them not cry in vain,
We'll throw off our fetters, and be free again.
Free to instruct them, our dear, innocent youth;
To lead them in paths of knowledge and truth,
Remembering our own happy youthful school-days,
Our books and our pleasures, our lessons and plays.
Oh! bright happy youth.! We look back to the past:
Then look at the present, how strong the constrast !
Here are bright boys and girls, neglected, untaught,
Growing up all around us toiling for naught.

Shall it ever be thus ? Shall the pure, sweet fount
So pleasant to us, flowing out from the mount,
Yield no drops to these dear ones, these noble boys,
From vice leading them upward to purer joys?

EDUCA T E THE CHILDREN.

Oh, parents and guardians and makers of laws,
No longer stand idle. Beware how you pause !
Would you have your boys men, true, noble and wise?
'Tis you that must thus make them, mnust help them to rise.
You cannot, it may be, send them to college,
Yet withhold not from them all useful knowledge ;
Their young minds are thirsting all pure truths to know,
Oh, let them not vicious and distorted grow.
Your daughters! Oh, parents, this life is to them
So vapid, so weary, without any aim
Save only to live as poor toilers and slaves
A wretched existence, then sink to their graves,
Unknown and uncared for, their names soon forgot
By the little home circle, the one loved spot
Where they toiled for the few.God placed in their care,
For another soon fills the once vacant chair.
Let science, fair science but smile on them now,
Let wreaths of true knowledge encircle their brow,
Nepenthe for sorrow, enhancer of joy!
Oh, make them too wise for a vain, useless toy.
Let science unroll them her mystical page ;
Let them be, if they will, as wise as a sage;
Let them measure the planets and trace their track,
Let them learn all beautifil things, in fact.
Oh, make them men's equal - in learning, I mean -
They want not the ballot, they'd reign the heart's queen;
But give them true wisdom for all aims in life,
'Twill make them more worthy as mother and wife.
But how shall we do this ? What wonderful power
Will give to the children this beautiful dower?
The Public School System, conducted with care,
Distributes to each one of knowledge a share. -

Sufficient foundation upon which to build
A right royal structure, with full means to gild
And hang with rare pictures-its galleries wide,
And adorn with rich carvings out and inside.
Democritus and Thucydides of Thrace
Belonged to a poor and sin-stricken race,
Yet nobly they rose, and gave to mankind
Examples most grand of the triumphs o~f mind.
But how shall we do this? We're taxed to death now;
We want all this badly, but, pray tell us how.
Why, make sacrifices all know we are poor,
Be content to live plainly and without show,
Discard all luxuries, if any need be.
You have none? Pray stop there and just leti me see:
Cigars and brandy of fathers and brothers,
Chignons and bustles of sisters and mothers.
Have schools, white and colored, conveniently near,
Employ good teachers for each one by the year ;
Let each of them be a good English scholar,
And have purer aims than-the almighty dollar.
Now, teachers, the children entrusted to you
Have hearts of affection warm, tender and true,
Sensitive and shrinking. . Should they appear dull,
Speak to them kindly; your reward will.be full.
All are not alike brilliant, nor are all bold ;
Some are timid, not stubborn; pray do not scold,
But lead them on gently, and cheer by a, smile
The timid and dull, even the wayward child.
The word of affection and sympathy warm
Have ne'er failed the heart of rebellion to charm,
And change to obedience the stubbornest will;
Then think of this, ye who the teacher's desk fill.

Then kindly, impartially judge each one's cause ;
You must work with nature, you can't force her laws;
No teaching can make ti e poor imbecile wise ;
Despite opposition, true genius will rise.
Then aid the poor weak one; be just, firm and kind,
Little by little you may strengthen his mind,
You may lead 'him up gently till, by your aid,
He can fill a position of no mean grade.
And the few who can with the strong eagle soar,
Delight in tall mountains and loud thunder's roar,
Whose miuds, scorning small things, must mount to the skies
Oh, faithfully lead them by right paths to rise.
Their natures impatient grow under restraint:
Be patient, 0 teacher ! No artist can paint.
The evil one rash word or unjust act throws
Athwart the proud spirit where lofty thought glows.
You have an honored post. Among your school band
May be embryo statesmen who'll rule our land;
Historians, philosophers, poets maybe,
Whose future success you will feel proud to see.

I well know each heart must bear its own part
Of the pain that in Adam began ;
If to us befall more grief than to all,
We are told 'tis a part of God's plan.
Though hard, I must accept it as just -
The path that is marked out for me;
And if I can't know, in life, why 'tis so,
In the bright free beyond I shall see,
With purified eyes, that His laws are wise,
And all prove Him omniscient and kind.
The light from the sky is dim to the eye,
By the dark veil before us made blind:
That veil will remove ; in mansions above
We shall know even as we are known;
The ills of this life, its cares and its strife,
Will vanish as we near the great throne.
Then let us press on till the goal is won,
The harp and the crown. of the blest;
The few fleeting years in this vale of tears,
Will soon pass and our hearts be at rest.
When that day shall come, with love, rest and home,
We'll rejoice that All danger is past ;
qur hearts purified, in hot furnace tried,
We'll be happy in heaven at last.

THE LOVE CHASE OF A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER.
A ROMANCE OF THE WAR.
CHAPTER I.
" All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players."-Shakspeare.
The wind howled dismally around Drewry's Bluff in January,
1864, as Captain Merton, of a Georgia battery, sat reading-now
and then calling impatiently to a lad near him:
" Tom, hasn't that lazy mail-carrier arrived yet ?-"
Very soon the mail for his company was brought in and dis-
tributed. Several letters bearing unmistakable signs of feminine
chirography, directed .to Captain Edgar Merton, were laid aside
for perusal at his leisure.
That my readers may understand my hero's impatience, I will
state, that to relieve the monotony of a soldier's life in winter
quarters, he had conceived and executed the bold plan of adver-
tising for a female correspondent, with a view to matrimony. To
do him justice, it is but right to say he never once thought of
gaining a wife by such means. His only wish was to make the
wheels of time drag less wearily until the spring weather should
permit him, once more, to see active service.
Tall agd commanding in figure, with a bold open countenance,
and an eye of piercing black which quailed not before the gaze of
the bravest of his enemies, yet as tender and sympathetic as a
woman toward the suffering of either friend or foe. He was one
to adorn the rebel grey, aird one whom any lady might be proud
to call friend or lover.
Let us look at him as he peruses those missives in answer to

his advertisement. There is a mischievous twinkle in his eye, and
a slight twitching of the muscles around his finely formed inouth,
as he tries to conceal his merriment from his brother officers, who
are happily too busy with their own secrets to take note of his
actions. Suddenly his whole expression changes, and the mirth
is all gone, while a look of intense adniiration has taken its place.
TIe holds in his hand a -letter, whose correct diction, chaste and
elegant language, combined with its beautiful penmanship, elicit
the admiration of our hero, whose love of all things pure and
beat tiful has become proverbial among his friends.
He reads and re-reads those charming lines until each expres-
sion is indelibly impressed on his mind. Then he gathers up the,
others --a dozen or more - and hands them to his brother offi-
cers, who have by this time gotten through with their messengers
from home, and are ready to make merry over these letters'of
varied penmanship and orthography, but all having the same
aim-that of securing a soldier correspondent. The favored one
is safely stowed away in his breast-pocket, too sacred for any eye
but his; while the name, LULA GRAVES, is repeated again and
again in secret.
There is a power, strong a, any the eye or tongue can wield
over the most susceptible heart, hidden in the formation of a let-
ter, or the arrangement of a sentence, a delicately turned compli-,
ment, or a modest reproof, given by an incognito, and our hero
walked as in a dream of fairyland.  He was scarcely able to wait
for an opportunity to send a letter, so anxious was. he to hear
from his unknown friend again. He wrote immediately, and
insisted on a meeting. He would visit her at her residence, or
meet her at any place she might appoint.
Two weeks--long, weary weeks they were to him---passed ere
he received an answer. When it came he was more firmly en-
chained"than ever. She did not think a meeting advisable until
they had become better acquainted by letter. She would inform
him when she would meet him, and he must abide her time. In
the meantime she would write regularly, and he must content
himself with her letters.
The correspondence continued for three months, until he was
ready to do or dare any impossible thing .for the sake of his

charming correspondent, so completely was he in love with her
style of writing. At length, about the middle of April, he wrote
to her that he would soon have to move with his battery, and, as
he did not know his-'destination, he felt sure she would not deny
him the pleasure of gazing, but once, on her lovely features, for
she must be beautiful as an angel.
He did not have to wait long for an answer, and it would be
difficult to imagine his ecstasy when he read that she would meet
him on the evening of the 28th on "Lovers' Leap," a romantic
cliff on James river. All necessary preparations for his departure
were immediately made, and he set out for the appointed /place of
meeting with high hopes and such feelings as may be better im-
agined than described. We will leave him for a while to look
after his correspondent.

" And she is fair, and fairer than that word
Of wondrous virtues.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth :

is burning in the sitting-room, while a knot of lightwood is
throwing its bright light all over the room. The latest papers
are lying on the candle-stand, where stands a regular Confederate
candle, made of ,a long wick dipped in melted beeswax and rosin,
and twisted fantastically around .an upright stand of pine-wood.
The father, a fine-looking, dignified old Virginia gentleman, turns
his candle so as to raise the wick a little higher, and proceeds to
read the news out to a group of attentive listeners - his wife and
daughter, who are busily engaged knitting socks for the soldiers,
and a young son, who listens to each recital of dangerous exploits
performed by dashing cavalrymen, and wishes he were old enough
to be with his brothers in the thickest of the fight.

AD VERTISING FOR A' WIFE.

After a while the old man grows weary of reading long-winded
editorials and thrilling accounts of cavalry adventures, and looks
over the advertisements. Soon he turns with a simile, " See here,
Carrie, a soldier is in want of a wife. There is a chance for you."
And lie laughinglyread out the notice, not thinking of it five
minutes later, nor ever once thinking his beautiful Carrie, petted
and spoiled as she had ever -been, would ever need the assistance
of a newspaper advertisement to get her a companion. Nor did
she give the subject a second thought, until a few days later, a
young friend of hers - as merry as, and even more thoughtless
than herself-proposed that she should answer it. " Just for fun,
you know, Carrie dear. Oh, it would be so charming !" And the
two talked it over until it was decided, that Carrie should answer
it, and Fannie Archer was to see the correspondence, and enjoy it.
Thus it was that Carrie Conway began a correspondence which
was to have an effect on her after-life she little expected then.
The letter was sent and received with what emotions we have
already seen, and another and another of his letters stowed away,
--no one being cognisant of the affair except Carrie's mother,
who remonstrated at first, but soon yielded her consent, thinking
it all fun anyway and no harm could come of it; and Fannie,
who read each letter, and hailed their arrival with more delight
than Carrie herself; for Carrie often felt some compunctions of
conscience and a slight fear of detection, as he became more and
mere anxious to see her.
Still she wrote on, urged by the fair syren Fannie Archer, who
was as much carried away with his letters as he was with Carrie's,
and secretly hoped that some chance would throw him in her way.
Carrie was more prepossessed in favor of her unknown admirer
than she dared confess, even to herself; so she thought in secret
of breaking off the correspondence, for the reason that he was too
noble to be trifled with. She dare not let him come up there, only.
to be deceived. The idea of meeting him was out of the question.
Her native modesty revolted at the idea of becoming acquainted
with a suitor in that manner.
She was more and more perplexed as he continued to urge a
meeting, while Fannie urged it as much as he did. She brought
forward every argument which she knew would possess weight

with an imaginative mind. There could. not possibly be any harm
in letting him visit " Lovers' Leap." The beautiful scenery would
well repay him for any disappointment he might meet with. He
praised his Georgia scenery - her Tallula and Toccoa -her
Stone Mountain, &amp;c., but he had never seen our noble James
above Richmond, and she thought he would not regret a visit to
that romantic spot. And then it would be so romantic to have a
knight-errant wandering about in search of an unknown "Ladye,"
or sitting forlornly on "Lovers' Leap," awaiting her arrival
Then she would contrive some way by which he and Carrie
should meet without his knowing she was " Lula Graves." Oh,
it would be ch arming! better than a novel. Everything was6o
dull now. the boys were all in the army, and this promised to be a
genuine romance in real life, better than .anything in the" Wa-
verley Novels." Thus were her scruples overcome, and the letter
forwarded, inviting him to meet her on "Lovers' Leap."
It would be difficult to describe the contending emotions which
swayed Carrie.Conway during 'the short space of time which in-
tervened between the writing of her letter and the 28th of April,
the time appointed for the meeting. She became restless and exci.
table to such a degree that her parents noted and commented on her
appearance.- At length the day and hour arrived, and Fannie
came galloping on horseback to inform Carrie that a strange man
was sitting on "Lovers' Leap." It was arranged that he should
be invited to Mr. Archer's, and Fannie returned home full of
bright anticipations. It would be just as she had wished; she
would see him first, and Carrie's power over' him would be
nothing compared to her arts and fascinating insinuations.
Many had been the true worshippers at the shrie of Carrie
Conway's beauty and real worth. Kind-hearted as she was, no
pleasure could be derived from causing another pain, and she felt
sad whenever she had to refuse a suitor for her hand. Now she
felt more so than usual, because she had enticed a stranger so far
only to deceive him. Taking her mother into her confidence,
they arranged a plan by which the stranger should be entertained
by them, without knowing she was his unknown friend. They
would relieve by kind attentions, as much as they could, the dis-
agreeable feeling under which he must be laboring.

hospitality of his house to him during his sojourn in the neighbor-
hood. Captain' Merton soon found, that his host, Mr. Williams,
knew all the ladies for miles around, and he made inquiries in an
indirect way, and found that there was _ no one in the neighbor-
hood by the name of Graves. His host invited him to accompany
him to see some ladies after tea, the Misses Archer, to which he
gladly consented, hoping to find some clue to the mystery in
which he was enveloped.
Let us look at Miss Fannie while Captain Merton is being in-
troduced. - A beautiful blonde, with soft, dreamy eyes of deepest
azure. Gay, and at times what we will call wild, she could be as
mild as a May morning when it suited her. To-night she has a
purpose to accomplish, and is as modest and retiring as possible,
while a look of consciousness she evidently tries to overcome at-
tracts the attention of our hero. He does not wish to make the
object of his visit public, therefore he is quite wary in his obser-
vations. He does not appear to notice Miss Fannie more than
her more deserving sister, still his ears are open to every word
she utters in her soft, almost musical tone, and'his eyes take in
every motion, and his thoughts run in this strain: If she be Lula
Graves, as she tries to make me believe, I shall go no further
toward an acquaintance; she has no right to expect it of me,
after the deception of this afternoon - and he made himself very
agreeable to her quiet, lady-like sister. She knew nothing of the
object of his visit, and treated him as she did all soldiers, kindly,
and made a much better impression than Fannie did.
The next morning found him at " Lovers' Leap " again, where
he sat for several hours. He was disappointed and vexed, but
determined to make the most of his visit by seeing as much of
the country as possible.
"Incontemplationis his proud recourse.
'Tis poor, as proud, by converse unsustained,
Rude thought runs wild in contemplation's field
Converse, the message, breaks it to the bit
Of due restraint."
So he felt, as he sat in lonely solitude. Oh for some gentle
spirit to commune with his of all this beauty ! - Some one to the
manor born, to instruct him in the legends of this wild and pic-

There is on the banks of the James a very romantic bluff,, a
large rock overhanging the canal, known as the "Lovers' Leap."
There are so many conflicting stories with regard to the origin of
the name, that one is lost in conjecture as to the truth of either
of them; though I am inclined to think that of the Indian Chief's
daughter the most probable, as well as the most romantic of all.
It wassaid that long ere the white man began, to settle on the
banks of our noble river, an Indian chief's daughter loved and
was beloved by a hostile chief. Her father became so enraged
that he threatened to kill his daughter and her lover if they ever
met again. It is true, I believe, with all nations as with ours,
that opposition lends force to love. It was so with the Indian
lovers ; they met, and were surprised by the ehaged father and
some of his braves. They fled, and were pursued until they
reached the bluff, where they halted, unable to proceed further,
until their pursuers drew near, when, finding escape impossible,
he folded his arms around her, and both leaped together from the.
brink of the overhanging rock, preferring death together, to sep-
aration or a father's fury.-
No doubt many a tale of love has been breathed into willing
ears on that same spot since the white man has turned those
forests into fertile fields ; and here our hero thought to behold, for
the first time, one who, he thought, could be scarcely less than
angel.
As he reached the brink of the cliff he stood in rapt wonder
and admiration, forgetting for a moment the object of his visit in
contemplating the beauty and grandeur of nature. But as, the
hour passed and nothing was seen of his incognito, he became rest-
less and impatient, the thought for the first time intruding itself
into his mind that he had come on a fol's errand. He lingered
until the darkness of night slhut out all objects from his vision,
then turned slowly away as loth to relinquish all hope of meeting
Lula there. He' sauntered slowly toward a dwelling not far off,
where dwelt an unmarried gentleman, who kindly extended the

turesque scene. It must have a history, and oh to learn that
history from Lula Graves, whose brilliant powers of imagination
could give it a word-painting more beautiful than any work of
art ! As lie thinks of all this, he exclaims with Dr. Young--
"Nature, in zeal for human amity,
Denies, or damps an undivided joy."
This spot must be a monument, lasting as time, to an unre-
quited affection, or a disappointed love,:from some cause. Why
should I be disappointed? I might have known the days of
romance were over, and no lady of true maidenly delicacy would
meet me as I proposed, and I could not love her if she did. Can
Miss Archer be Lula-my Lula ? No, she is fair, but she could
never write such letters. I must go away from here  satisfied.
In the din of battle I shall soon have an opportunity o forget it
all. My country must be my only love-; and he walked slowly
toward the postoffice to await the arrival of the down packet to
take him back to his command. As he neared the group of men
standing in' front of the office, his host, Mr. Williams, spoke:
"Here is a letterfor you, Captain." He took it and walked away
from the group to read it. His eye kindled with renewed hope
as he recognised the handwriting, and he tore it open hastily and
read-
" Captain Merton: By calling at .Mr. Conway's this afternoon
at five o'clock you will meet with and obtain an explanation from
your                      ,                      LLA."

ticularly kind to soldiers. Their house was always open to receive
the defenders of their home and rights. It was no matter of
, comment, then, that Captain Merton should ask for entertainment
for the night, upon a plea of -business for his government. He
might have remained a month upon that plea without causing a
thought of distrust to enter the mind of a member- of the Conway
family.
There was one, however, who was, seemingly, as indifferent
as could be with regard to thedbusinessbof the stranger, whose
heart gave a quicker bound, and whose brow and cheek flushed
to a crimson hue as his name was announced. It was but for an
instant, however, and she became as calm and self-possessed as
the most consummate actress could desire. She dare not appear
backward in entertaining hind lest he should suspect her. His
easy, gentlemanly manners made it no difficult task to converse
with him freely upon the topics of the day, whl tohite
hours passed away so pleasantly he quite forgot, in the society of
so charming a being as Carrie, that he was there to meet another.
She longed to know his thoughts upon a certain subject, yet
dreaded to hear it mentioned.                            d
At tea the subject of the scenery along the river was introduced,

and her father was proud of her proficiency. She was a little ex-

finer of human nature, soon gained the mastery over every other,
emotion, and her fingers moved over the polished. keys of her
piano with such grace as Captain Merton thought he had never
seen before. He asked for a song, and soon her voice rose in such
strains of birdlike melody, he sat entranced, the ecstatic thought

the moon. Yes, as far superior to her in- beauty of person and
mind as tie sun is to the smallest star."
He stood beside her and turned her music. At length, as she
closed a very brilliant song, he wrote on a slip of paper, and.
placed before her, "Do you know Lula Graves ?"
She raised her eyes to his, those large hazel eyes, shaded by
long, dark lashes--so inquiringly, and with such a surprised look,
as she answered, "No, sir, there is no one bearing that name upon
my list of acquaintances," that he colored, thinkig, " She is not
Lula."
Then, in a tone in which disappointment was strongly discern-
ible,.he begaii and narrated the whole story. Her eyes never
moved from his as he proceeded, until he spoke of his disappoint-
ment, of her note requesting him to meet her. there. Then her
eyes fell for an instant, as she murmured, " How cruel ! how very
wicked, to treat you so. Why should she request you to meet
her here ? It is very strange. Graves=- Graves - I never knew
any one by that name. Whoever she is, she is certainly lacking
in politeness as well as honesty. But pardon my indignation, sir,
I did not nean to wound your feelings by speaking 'lightly of
your friend."
He smiled such a bright, untroubled smile, she thought he
could not be much disappointed, and she felt a slight pang of
jealousy: for while her heart was untouched, as far as she knew,
by the interesting stranger, her vanity was not a little piqued at
his seeming indifference.  Strange contradiction !' She was
piqued at his seeming forgetfulness of her interesting letters,
while that forgetfulness was caused by the superior attractions of
the author of those letters. When he retired that night, Carrie
Conway, Lula Graves, and "Lovers' Leap" were strangely mingled
in his mind; while the very noble-looking, romantic stranger
formed the basis of hei' dreams.
He lingered the next morning, as loth to quit the enchanted'
ground until he was forced to go to meet the boat which bore
him back to!Richmond to meet his command; for his time was,
precious then,. He dared not remain longer from his command,
The hills were already reverberating with the sound of the
deep-mouthed cannon. While a mystery still hung around his

charming correspondent, be was very well satisfied with the
result of his visit. If Carrie did not write those letters he be-
lieved she could write equally as well, though he would be glad
to know they were one and the same.
A week later and Carrie received a very polite letter frm
Captain Merton, requesting the pleasure of.a correspondence with
her. It was with considerable regret that she declined what
would have been a pleasure to her; but she had some honest
scruples about the matter. What she had done was only done
through girlish romance and love of fun. She had quieted her
conscience by saying to herself, " Any one who advertises for a
correspondent must expect to get answers from girls who would
never think of being anything more than an incognito." Now
she had seen him.and learned something of his feelings and dis-
position. She thought it wrong to carry on a flirtation, or a cor-
respondence which might lead to one. Therefore she wrote very.
politely and candidly that she did not correspond with strange
gentlemen, and must decline the pleasure of a correspondence
with him. She hoped her refusal would not be a matter of regret,
considering their very short, though pleasant acquaintance.
A few weeks later he wrote again, saying he had tried, amid
the din of battle, to forget her, but found it impossible. He was
hasty, he knew=- that was the fault of his impulsive Southern
blood ; still lie loved her as truly and fondly as if he had known
her for years. She was the perfect reality of his dreams, his ideal
of womanhood. His home was very lonely: no mother's or
sister's gentle voice to welcome him home from the army, and he
begged her to become the mistress of his hand and fortune, and
the idol of his. worship, a fit divinity to be enshrined in the heart
of the most. favored mortal.
She replied that she was astonished at his haste in making a
proposal of so momentous a character. She could not become
sufficiently acquainted with a person's feelings and general suit-
ableness of disposition as a life-long companion upon so short an
acquaintance. The very fact of his making such a proposal to
her under the circumstances was evidence conclusive to her mind
that his affection could not be lasting. He acted too much from
impulse. She believed in a union formed upon a congeniality of

tastes and sentiments. They knew nothing of each other save a
short acquaintance of a few hours, and ended by saying she
hoped this refusal of the honor intended her would be considered

there was anything to be gained by farther perseverance.
CHAPTER      V.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more
Or close the wall up with our English dead!
In peace, there's nothing. so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility ;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger:
Stiffen the sitews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard favored rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect."-Shakspeare.
The spring and summer, yea the whole of 1864, was a time of
terrible slaughter toy our armies. No time was left our hero for
reflections of a private character. He had entered upon the du-
ties of a soldier with seriousness and a* pre-determination to do
his best for what he considered his rights, the right to do what-
he chose with his own. He did not fight for slavery, though he
had been reared with them, had been nursed by them, and many
of his inherited slaves were almost as dear to him as his kindred.
His boyhood companions and his playmates in childhood, he,
never once thought of parting with them for money, and felt that
he committed no sin in owning them. Still he would have yielded
them up cheerfully on the altar of his country had they been the
only cause, of dissension. He thought of all the hideousness of
such a war, father against son and brother against brother ; and
his thoughts turned to the war of the Roses, to the time of King
Henry the Sixth, and he fancied he could see the son bringing in
the body of his father, as he exclaims:
" Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight.
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
And I[that take them from him now, -

May yet, ere night, yield both my life and them
To some one else, as doth this man to me.
Who's-this? 0God! it is my father's face,
Whom in this conflict I, unawares, have killed.
Oh, heavy times, begetting such events !

My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came.on the part of York, pressed by his master.'
King H.-" Oh, piteous spectacle! Oh, bloody times!
Whilst lions war and battle for their dens,
Poor, harmless lambs abide their enmity,
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee, tear for tear,
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war
Be blind with tears, and break, o'ercharged with grief."
" Enter a father who has killed his son, with his body in his
arms."
Father.-" Thou, that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold,
For'I have bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see; is this our foeman's face?
Ah! no, no, it is mine only son."
gingH --" woe above woe! grief more than common grief
Oh, that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
Oh, pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!

The fatal colors of our striving houses,

Many tens of thousands of lives had withered during the un-
hallowed struggle between North and South ere the spring cain-
paign of 1864 began. Now the terrible carnage began, and the
Wilderness and Spottsylvania Courthouse will live upon the
bloodiest page of the history of the war. Terrible, indeed, was
the slaughter as Grant's broken ranks were rapidly filled up. Re-
inforcements after reinforcements were hurried into action, while
the shell and shot from   Lee's entrenchments mowed them down
like wheat ready for the harvest. Many deeds of daring has his-
tory to record of that bloody time, and many a brave man's bones
lie bleaching on those horrid fields; while mothers, wives and
children were left to mourn their hopes blasted and dead. Carrie
Conway read, with blanching cheek, the accounts of deeds of

daring performed by Captain Merton, who was promoted to Majoij
for gallantry.
Inch by inch was the ground between the Rapidan and James-
1ivers hotly contested. Backward, receding as a hoarse wave,
rolled the tide of war. Slowly, yet surely, on came Grant's over-
powering numbers, .until the small space around Richmond and
Petersburg was all that General Lee could claim. Grant, as a lion
couchant, lay watching his prey, but too well satisfied of the fact
that Starvation was an abler general than even the otherwise un-
equalled Lee himself; therefore with patience he bided his time,
knowing that sooner or later would come the downfall of that
once powerful army, than which a more valiant was never known
in history. My readers must permit me to glory a little in the
valor of my countrymen, even though that valor was shown in a
lost cause. Of one thing I am fully satisfied : had they been suc-
cessful, all lands would have rung with their praise. As it is,. we
can but admire the courage which can so bravely undertake to
overcome an impossibility.
"The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood."

History will record the events of the year 1865 much better
than my feeble pen can do. With government affairs I have
nothing to do, only in- so far as my hero is concerned.. Mining
and countermining, with every other horrid device of war, kept
him engaged during t~a winter months in the vicinity of Peters-
burg. At times the monotony was wearisome, relieved now and
then by a shell from the enemy's line of fortifications, which were
close enough to admit an exchange of courtesies. "Get down,

Johnny; we are going to fire now," was the frequent salutation
of a friendly enemy, as he walked out for a breath of morning air.
The mails brought him nothing of interest, only an occasional
letter from his steward at home. He had eschewed all female
correspondents'since his unfortunate visit to Lovers' Leap. No
beauty could attract his eye; nothing animated him but the call
"To arms." Now he became sad and dispirited; his beautiful
home had been "Shermanized." Nothing left of all his wealth
except his land ; the old family mansion in ashes ; his horses and
cattle stolen; the few old family servants whose love for " old
master's son" made them cling to him, remained-more of a
burden than a help. Now, it was whispered that Richmond, and
probably Virginia, would be evacuated soon. He knew too well
that, if this were so, nothing couldanimate the soldiers to further
endurance. He very rightly interpreted such a move as inability
on the part of our Commander-in-Chief to hold the State-the
newspaper falsehoods and pretences that. it would be .a great
strategic move, if so, to the contrary notwithstanding.
He thought he could see the hand of Providence in it all. Bad
crops, and consequently starvation at home, while the soldiers'
rations barely kept them alive, all conspired to unnerve the
soldier's arm. He was not surprised then, though heart-sick and
weary of everything, when the order came to move from Peters-
burg without delay. Theaccount given by soldiers of that retreat
go to prove that it was the beginning of the end. Had the sur-
render been made at Richmond, much suffering and loss of prop-
erty would have been avoided; but the people would have been
dissatisfied, and it seemed to have been General Lee's aim to
please the people. But these things are for abler pens than mine.
Let us follow our hero on the disastrous march. Sadly yet
boldly he pushed forward his battery. Out of rations, his men
took a portion of the little corn issued to their horses, and, in
many cases, ate it raw, their feet bleeding and. their whAle
frame quivering with fatigue. ' When his battery was captured,
and his men scattered and straggling, he e-caped the enemy to
follow the hopeless fortunes of his division. General Lee pushed
on, now and then turning to meet his pursuers, who harassed
him at every step until lie reached Appomattox Courthouse.

Here his army lay, massed a short distance west of the Court,-
house-every avenue of escape cut, off. The idea of extricating
his army from such a position by-fighting was an impossibility
too plain to admit of a second thought. The only hope now was
in a surrender upon good terms.
On the 7th of April began a correspondence betWeen Generals
Grant and Lee, relative to a surrender. The whole correspon-
dence was characterised by that spirit of true bravery which a
successful warrior feels at the downfall of an enemy who has done
his best. General Grant knew that Robert E. Lee was an enemy
worthy of his steel, and admired his noble spirit too much to
subject him to any unnecessary humiliation. Even the savages
of the wilds of America admired a brave man and treated 'him
with kindness. . I believe it is generally the case that those who
are never exposed to the dangers of battle and are too cowardly to
fight, are the most, bitter against their enemies, and would mur-
der them, even though they be disarmed and conquered.
On the '9th of April the surrender was completed, and the
South had no longer an army in Virginia. Many made'their
escape to join General Johnston in North Carolina.  They
reached him just in time to be surrendered. Among the number
was Major Merton. With no near connection to care for his wel-
fare, and but too true to an unrequited affection, which had out-
lived twelve months of hardships such as none but a Confederate
knows anything about; his fortune wasted by his enemies; he
cared for nothing in Georgia. Still he thought that was his
home;' he would see what could be made of the ruins. . He found
no house to shelter him, and nothing that could be converted into
money with which to build ; his broad, acres of fertile cotton lands
would make some enterprising Yankee's fortune;, he would be
forced to sell a portion, then why not sell all ? He felt that he
coul not live on a portion of his inheritance, while the remainder
w   owned by strangers. Then the old house with its familiar
fu iture the dear old family portraits, were all gone. So he ad-
vertised his land, and very soon found a purchaser. Now, nothing
kept him there; so, with his pockets full of greenbacks, he re-
turned to Virginia. Once more we find him, in August, at
" Lovers' Leap." This time be came to see about a farm, which

he heard could be purchased. As he sits on that rock, which is
so fraught with disappointments to him, his thoughts are not of
Lula, but of Carrie; and he sighs to himself: "I wonder if she
is still unmarried. She said she could not wed an entire stranger ;
I will settle near her. vI will not remain a stranger. Love such
as mine must have its reward."
A farm  was purchased a few miles distant.. It was well
stocked, laborers hired, and our hero went to farming in earnest.
He soon gained the reputation of an intelligent and enterprising
farmer, and such a man could not fail to attract the attention of
Mr. Conway, who had the reputation of being the best read man
in the neighborhood. He entertained the idea that to be a good
farmer one must be a learned man, a scientific man, and when he
heard how his new neighbor was getting along, he exclaimed,
" That is the sort of man for me. I shall go over to see him this
very day." No one recognised the name except Carrie, and she
did not dare to tell any one she knew him, lest the report that he
came for her sake would be circulated. Even Fannie Archer was
too much engrossed with the attention of a moustached merchant
to think of the stranger whom she once tried to entrap.
Mr. Conway was both pleased and surprised to find in his new
neighbor, the rebel captain who had charmed him with descrip-
tions of battles a year previous. A close student of human
nature, Mr. Conway was rarely, if ever, mistaken in his estimate
of character, and showed his partiality very plainly.  Major
Merton was pressed to return the visit very soon, with the assu-
rance that Mrs. and Miss Conway would be pleased to see him.
He was not slow in following the dictates of his own heart,
and Mr. Conway's parlor was soon lighted up for his special
benefit.

ADVERTISING FOR A WIFE.
CHAPTER VII.
O, my Lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love;
But now I am returned, and that war thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their room
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is."--Shakepeare.

It was middle October. The air was unusually soft and balmy,
when Major Merton sat on the porch of Mr. Conway's dwelling,
talking in a low, earnest tone to a very attentive listener. Carrie
never looked more lovely in all her life, as with downcast eyes
and crimson cheeks, her taper fingers toying nervously with the
cord and tassel of her silk apron, she listened to those impassioned
words whose very earnestness made them eloquent. The full
moon made long lines of lightacross the porch, and glimmers of
brightness sparkled in 'her golden hair as she bent low to whisper
a response to his importunate pleading. Mirth and quiet happi-
ness were struggling for the ascendancy in her moistened eyes,
and the dimples around her beautiful mouth as she spoke almost
audibly: "It is useless for me to try to conceal the fact that I like
you very much, yet there is one thing about which I am not ex-
actly. satisfied. When you came -to this vicinity on your first
visit, you followed an ignisfatuus, as you afterwards thought. I
have recently found your correspondent, and can assure you that
Lula Graves is no myth, but is a living reality, and every whit
as worthy of your love as I am. Had she met you, as proposed,
you might have yielded to her what you had well-nigh yielded to
her letters - your unchanging affection.  I have but recently
heard you speak of her letters as-being nearer perfection than
anything epistolary you ever read. Now could you meet with
their author, and find her as fair and pure as her letters indicate,
you would learn to love her far better than you, can love me. I
will put you to the test. To-morrow morning at nine o'clock she
will meet you alone at 'Lovers' Leap.' There will be no deception
this time. If you find that you love heir, I will exonerate you

from all blame; if you still think you can love me best, I will be
yours. Until that test. Is tried, we will say no more upon the
subject. I only hope you may find your unknown friend all your
fancy painted her."
He arose and walked the floor for several minutes; at length
he stopped before her, and taking her hand in his, gazed long and
steadily in her face, until her eyes dropped, and a' crimson flush
suffused her face, then releasing her hand, he said with a- smile:
"Be it as you say. I do not fear the test, but remember your
promise, and you will be mine."  *  *    *    *   *    *
Nine o'clock found him at "Lovers' Leap." If the October
moon was so beautiful, its sunlight was still more so. The early
frosts had tinged the margin of the beautiful James, and Autumn's
gorgeous dyes variegated every clump of trees or shrubbery. A
light fog was being slowly lifted above the adjacent hill-tops, and
the frost on the grass and many-colored leaves glittered like rarest
gems in the morning sun. There are brighter skies and -a clime
where the leaves never fade, where the biting frosts of autumn
never mar the beauty of a landscape ; but there is no, beauty more
enchanting to us of the " Old Dominion," than the sparkle of the
waters of our own noble James, as they seem to rise up to meet
the kiss of the morning sunbeams.
Methinks our hero must have been very much enchanted,-since
he failed to observe the approach of a female closely veiled and
shawled, until a slight rustling at his side caused him to turn very
suddenly, and his face to flush painfully. He had almost hoped
she would not come, and now she was there, what sh ,Eld he say
to her ? At length the ludicrousness of his position burst upon
him in full force and he laughed outright. He soon checked him-
self, however, as she turned with a grieved air to leave him
"Stay," he cried, "this is Miss Graves, I believe."  She nodded
assent. What should he say next? He did not care for an ex-
planation, but he really would like to see the author of those let-
ters.. Then there was something enticingly romantic to a young
man in such a position, so he mustered up sufficient courage to
approach her and offer his hand with a smile, as he said : " Our
meeting has been postponed quite tantalisingly, Miss Graves.. I
hope we meet as friends now. At least the message I received

on yesterday evening led me to such a conclusion. I have been
cruelly deceived. Eighteen months ago I would have dared any
impossibility for such a meeting. Now, when I had long ago given
up all hope of ever seeing my fair incognito, you favor me with an
interview. Can you explain the very strange deceptions you have
practised upon me?" She spoke in a low tone: "You must
never let any one except Carrie know of this meeting. Your
advertisement in the papers attracted my attention, and prompted
by a spirit of fun, as well as by the importunities of a thoughtless
friend, 'I answered it. You know how I was led along by your
flattering letters. When I began I had not the most remote idea
that I would ever see you, and I would not be so unmaidenly
now as to seek this interview, but for the purpose of dispelling
my friend's doubts respecting' your love for her. I hope your
meeting with her and the kind people of this neighborhood will
plead for my pardon. I have regretted the deception very much,
and have never corresponded with a stranger since, and never
will again. Am I forgiven? " There was a something strangely
familiar in the air and figure of Lula Graves, and her low, child-
like voice had so much of music in it that he longed to see that
tantalising veil removed, and he said in answer td her question,
" You are forgiven upon one condition: that you let me see my
fair tormentor. You let me write your sweet name, Lula. Now,
Lula, my friend Lula, you will not deny me the privilege of
knowing you.when we meet again, as I hope we will. As Carrie's
friend, I hope to see you often. You will' not deny me a sight
of your fair face when I tell you she has made that test a condition
upon which I may claim her hand. I loved you as an incognito.
I do not deny it. Your letters had a strange fascination about
them, but it was not my fault that you failed to meet me, and I
saw and loved Carrie Conway as a blessed reality. Let me
remove that veil."
She stood irresolute for a second, then with a low, merry
augh, she said, "Be it so then," and the veil was thrown back,
disclosing to her astonished listener the bright, laughing eyes and
golden curls of Carrie Conway. Picture, if you can, my readers,
the amazement of our hero as, he stood transfixed with wonder,
until Carrie, with a'sweet smile and blush, said, as she extended
her hand, " Which shall it be, Lula or Carrie?"

." Both," he exclaimed, "for both are perfect ! Now am.I sat-
isfied, since Carrie and Lula are one and mine, now and forever,"
and with his native impulsiveness he folded her in his arms and
imprinted the first -kiss of love on her blushing cheek.
We will leave them now, reader, with the assurance that they
are too busy with their own affairs to desire our -company.
Madame Rumor.says there will be a wedding at Mr. Conway's
soon ; indeed, that the invitations are already out, and adds that
a certain bachelor's establishment is being fitted up for the recep-
tion of a lady resident. As for us, we hope they will never regret
that newspaper advertisement ; we will not if, they will invite us
to the wedding.

A.fifi'anda.      I have no ambition
Fedirand. To see a goodlier man.
Perdinand.        But you, O! you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best.-Shak8peare.
On a cliff overhanging a beautiful Southern stream stood a
neat white cottage, embowered in a grove of live oak, magnolia
and orange trees.   Around the columns of the portico the
yellow jasmine and the fragrant . honeysuckle mingled their
colors and their odors. The space between the front door and the
evergreen hedge which enclosed the yard was filled with choice
shrubbery and beds of flowers, giving evidence of a refined taste
m their selection and arrangement.
Let us look within the dwelling, and we will see still further
evidences of cultivation and refinement. There is no display or
lavish expenditure of money; for the inmates, an invalid widow
and her only child, a young lady of eighteen, are content to live
within their income, and have something left over for charity.
In the sitting-room you may see a handsome piano, and near it a
stand, upon which lie several bound Volumes of music. Near
this window, overlooking the river, is an etegere, whereon you
may And rare volumes of history, romance and poetry. Before
the window is an easy-chair. Close by is a sofa, where Mirs. Lee
reclines to listen to music, or her daughter's voice in reading, or
for conversation.  Those delightful evenings were frequently
broken in upon; such rare' attractions could not be hidden.
Mrs. Lee's long-continued illness .had prevented her daughter
from mingling to-any great extent in the society of her neighbor-
hood, though there were a few valued friends who found the way
to that pleasant parlor since. Mrs. Lee's convalescence had per.

mitted her to join them. Several gentlemen had called, and some
were frequent visitors.
Dr. Marshall, who had been called in to see Mrs. Lee upon the
occasion of one of her attacks, found a magnet which drew him
to the cottage much more frequently than the case demanded.
For several months he had called, ostensibly to inquire after his
patient, but really to see and have an hour's chat' with Miss
Ethel; now and then merely stopping to leave a book or period-
ical for her perusal, or to beg the loan of some particular volume.
He was young, graceful in form and action, delicate in appear-
ance, and with a high, intellectual brow. He was modest, yet
easy in his manners, rather reserved in general society, yet very
pleasant and sociable when he became better acquainted. With
no fortune save a lucrative profession, an unstained name and
high moral character, he felt that the world might consider him
unworthy of Miss Lee; still heknew he was her equal in all save
fortune. A man may be modest, and yet feel his right to the re-
spect of his fellow-men. He may be very poor, may have to toil
incessantly for his daily bread, yet know, without arrogance, that
he is the peer of many who consider themselves his superiors.
Mind will assert its independence of adverse circumstances. Dr.
franklin owned to a little vanity, and thought it commendable to
have enough to stimulate a person to exertion in any laudable
enterprise. Dr. Marshall knew his power in his neighborhood,
for he had attained to wonderful eminence in his profession for
one so young, only twenty-six. Still he was modest and unaf-
fected in his intercourse with his fellow-man. Mrs. Lee and her
daughter found him a pleasant and congenial friend-" too inno-
cent for coquetry." Ethel'-s heightened color and the joyous
sparkle of her dark blue eyes at his coming were, after much
doubting, rightly interpreted by the Doctor, who made no delay
in telling her the story of his love.. Mrs. Lee gave a cheerful
assent to an early marriage. It was just what she desired. He
was to live with her, and be hef son indeed. Two- months from
that-day was named as the wedding-day.
Here I would gladly leave these lovers, happy in the con-
sciousness of mutual love; but the true historian must record
painful as well as pleasant facts. I must, of necessity, introduce

his friend, feeling very sad, for he saw that his mind was tottering
on the verge of insanity. Arthur Marshall had loved Isabel
King as a sister, and she and her brother were expected to act as
attendants at the bridal. It was the evening preceding the bridal
eve, and he stopped a few minutes to see Ethel once more before
he could claim her as his own. He sat long after tea in pleasant
converse. He would not pain her by a recital of her friend's affec-
tion and treatment of himself. The moon was high in the heavens
when she followed him to the gate to bid him a lingering adieu.
Not a cloud obscured the brightness of the moon ; and the lovers
smiled as they thought the course of true lov6 had run very
smoothly with them, and accepted this cloudless night as a
presage of a bright and happy future. Sweet was Ethel's sleep of
innocence that night. Did no dark shadows warn her of to-
morrow's wretchedness ?

another actor upon the stage. There lived on one of the finest
estates in the South, just across the river from Mrs. Lee's, a young
gentleman, of fine, manly figure, tall and athletic; a handsome
face, with pleasant black eyes and beautiful glossy beard.. Add:

a noble line of ancestors, and you have a tout-ensemble perfectly ir-
resistible with the majority of young ladies. He was'considered
the best " catch " in all that country, and the young ladies had
curled and painted at him to no purpose. The modest violet had
more charms for himn than the most queenly rose or stately lily.
Henry King was (among the number who acknowledged the
superior attractions of Mrs. Lee's pleasant cottage; and a few
days previous to her engagement with Dr. Marshall he had pro-
posed to Ethel, and been kindly but firmly rejected.  He and'
Arthur Marshall had been friends from childhood. Their affection
for each other had been compared to that of David and Jonathan.
Now, many-things which had been unobserved before, attracted
his attention,;and he knew, before his friend told him of his en-
gagement and approaching marriage, that Arthur Marshall was
his rival. He was an ardent, impassioned lover-had never been
opposed or crossed in anything in all his life; therefore a rejec-
tion of his suit had never been counted on. He tried to reason
upon the subject, and for a time succeeded so well that not even
his only sister knew how deep the wound was he had received.
He went so far ias to congratulate his friend upon his success,
speaking in glowing terms of the worth of his affianced, and all
without betraying any undue excitement. But as the day for the'
marriage approached he became gloomy and abstracted, at times'
boisterously gay,- was several times seen to wander, as if in.
search of something, around the cliff near Mrs. Lee's. His sister
noted the change in his manner, and sent for Dr. Marshall to try
to find out the nature of his malady. As he had ceased to go into
-society, none of his neighbors knew of hi situation. When the
Doctor approached him in his chamber he was rudely ordered
to leave the house, and upbraided with having supplanted him
in the affections of the only woman he could ever love. This was
altogether new to the Doctor. ' Ethel's modesty had prevented her
from mentioning her conquests, even to her betrothed. He left

On the following morning Ethel was rudely awakened by. a
servant calling to her: " Git up, Miss Ethie! Dr. Marshall done
kill Mars Henry King down to the bluff; and de folks done carry
him to jail; and Mistis she is dead. For de Lord's sake, git up
Miss Ethie." Ethel opened her eyes, but half way comprehending
what the girl was saying to her, when a sob on the opposite side
of the room arrested her attention. She, started up on beholding
her old nurse bending 'over her mother and chafing her hands.
In a moment she was-beside her, and-their united efforts soon re-
stored her to consciousness. When Mrs. Lee had been placed on
the bed from which she had arisen in her excitement, in answer
to Ethel's question, "What is it all, mother? '" she replied "Hagar

will tell you," and closed her eyes in weariness. Ethel followed
the old woman to the dining-room, when she learned that after
Dr. Marshall had left her the evening before he went to the bluff,
where he met Mr. King. No one seemed to know why they were
there at that late hour; but Mr. Roberts chanced to pass just in
time to see Dr. Marshall stab Henry King to the heart, that he
(Mr. R.) then went)to apprise Miss King and the servants of his
death, while the Doctor rode to town and surrendered himself,.
and was then in jail.
Ethel did not faint or give ent to any violent expressions of
grief. For a while the news stuhvd her. She was deadly pale,
while her fingers clutched each other convulsively. She could not
believe it was all true, for why should he kill his dearest friend ?
Still the old negro's story was told in so straightforward a
manner she knew there must be some truth-in it.
A boy was sent with a note to Dr. Marshall, and soon returned
with a reply. "Come to me, Ethie. Do not shrink from me, I
am no murderer, though the whole town seems to think me one.
Come and let me tell you the whole story.-Your wretched
Arthur." Timid and shrinking from anything like publicity as
Ethel was, she felt that was no time for such scruples. She or-
dered the carriage, and with old Hagar as her attendant, she
hurried, closely veiled, to the prison where her lover, who was to
have been her husband that day, sat, the picture of gloom. and
misery. "Will Ethel believe me innocent?" was the thought
which wholly possessed him as the jailor told him a lady wished
to see him. He had not time to reply before Ethel entered and
fell upon her knees before him, weeping bitterly. He tried to
soothe her, but the fountain of tears had been restrained so long,
she could not control them until she wept for several minutes.
At length he raised her head and looked into her face sorrowfully.
"You believe me guilty, Ethic? Do I look like a murderer ?"
She started up an4eried, "A murderer, Arthur ! Oh, no, not that.
I meant to comfort you, but it makes me so miserable to see you
here. Tell me you will soon be released."  " Listen, Ethic, and I
will tell you all about this horrid affair ; at least all that I know.
When I left your house yesterday evening, and neared the bluff
just above the bridge, I heard what appeared to me to be a person

talking to himself, as there was only one voice. I stopped and
listened, when suddenly a sharp cry as' of pain, and then a deep
groan fell upon my ear. The ioon was shining brightly, and I
galloped forward, as near as I could get with my horse. I then
dismounted, and walked to the edge of the cliff, where I found my
best friend, Henry King, just gasping for breath, with his face up-
tur-ned to the moon and a dagger in his breast. Oh! Ethie, you
can't imagine the horror of that moment. I drew out the knife
and tried to stop the blood, but he was dead, without a word or
sign of recognition. I arose from the bleeding body with the knife
dripping with his heart's blood in my hand. Just then Mr.
Roberts came up to me, and started back in horror as he saw me,
and exclaimed, ' Great God, Doctor, is this you ? How did this
happen ?' I told him all that I have told you, when he said he
would go and get help to take the body home, if I would watch
beside it until his return. I did so. When the servants from the
mansion came with Mr. Roberts, I went with them to the house,
saw Isabel, and told her all about it that I knew. She told me
she knew he was insane, and he must have killed himself. She
went with me to see the body, and fainted. I was trying to
restore her when an officer entered and told me I was under arrest
for the murder of Mr. King. He showed me .his authority. I
found that, when Mr. Roberts left me alone with the dead, he had
written anote and sent a servant with it to have me arrested. I
am to appear before the examining court at twelve o'clock to-day,
when I hope to be released. Isabel King's testimony will satisfy
the court that her br there was insane. Our bridal will, neces-
sarily, be postponed a cjay. or two, but I shall soon be free to claim
my bride." Ethel returned home, happy in the knowledge of her
lover's ihnocence, and in the belief that he would soon be re-
leased.
The examining-court met and found what they termed a true
bill against him, and he was remanded to jail to await the spring
term of the Circuit court, to be tried for murder, and the murder
of the dearest friend he had., Public opinion is a strange, uncer-
tain thing. Twenty-four hours ago, every person who knew Dr.
Marshall believed him a model young man, and lie had the confi-
dence and good wishes of all; now, there was not a dozen who be

lieved him innocent. Miss Lee, whose name was the synonym for
every virtue, was' stigmatised as being the .cause of the whole
affair. It was repoi'ted and believed that Dr. Marshall was jealous
of Mr. King, and had murdered him lest he should prove a rival
in his wife's 'affections. Some were ill-natured enough to assert
-that Miss Lee had tried every means in her power to secure Mr
King's hand and fortune; that she did not love Dr. Marshall, was
only going to marry him because she could not .get the one she
wanted. Isabel King was    ill with brain-fever to make any
statement. Old Dr. Hall  a by her side, trying in vain to re-
store her reason.' Ike believed his young friend innocent, and did
all he could for the defence.
O the weary months of anxiety and waiting!. Friends tried to
bail him out.. He was needed among his patients, but' the case
was considered too desperate to admit of bail. Mr. Roberts was
the only witness for the prosecution; but he was a man of high
standing in the county, and no one doubted the truth of what he
stated. Then circumstances were strongly against him.  The
time of night, the fact. that they were together on that'par-
ticular night and at that place, did not appear to the wise men
to be wholly accidental. Five months Of prison life, with a pros-
peet of something worse at the expiration of that time, presented
no pleasant picture to his imagination.
Poor Ethel! what a sad' termination to-a day which she had
thought would end so happily. The night was as unclouded as
the preceding one, still she saw no beauty in anything. Her
lover in prison for murder, and her mother suffering severely
from an unusually violent attack brought on by that day's ex-
citement. Oh how wearily the long hours of the night passed
away!
Time, that great healer of wounds, i rched on with steady
strides, and left some hope in Dr. Marshall's heart. True, public
opinion was against him, and he heard that Mr. Roberts was very
active-in prosecuting him. -Why he should be, he could not im-
agine. He had always professed firm friendship for him. He had
noticed too, that in giving in his testimony he told his story in
such a way as to influence the court as much as possible against-
him. Still there were some friends who did all-in their power for'

him. Able counsel was employed. Ethel visited him as fre-
quently as her mother's fast-failing' health would permit her to
do ; supplied him with every comfort her kind heart could devise ;
and always left him more hopeful than she found him. Spring
came, robed in all her loveliness, and filling all nature with glad-
ness; yet there was no gladness in Dr. Marshall's heart as his
trial approached.
Court met and the case was called,'but the witness for the
prosecution was absent - unavoidably detained with a sick child
in a distant State, so his excuse ran, therefore it must be post-
poned for six months longer. Thought full of horror to those
most concerned ! 0 the tardiness of the law ! How we fume
and fret sometimes, when, if we could see all things at a glance,
we would bless rather than curse such, delays.
The offer of bail was renewed, with the earnest prayer that he
might have the freedom of the town, but was refused. Such a
thing as releasing a murderer on bail was unprecedented. That
privilege was reserved for more modern times, when money can
purchase anything, even a cowardly assassin's release from all
punishment.
Mrs. Lee, worn out by such constant care and excitement, sank
to rest before the sunmer ended, and was laid beside her husband,
leaving Ethel all alone in the world. Who canfathom the depth
of the prisoner's sorrow as he thought of the suffering of her
whom he loved so tenderly? Her plump figure had been worn
very thin, and the color had been driven from her cheeks by cbn-
stant watching beside her sick mother, arid her heart was'ready
to break with its heavy load of cares. No one -had been en-
couraged to cross her threshold for months except Dr. Hall, and
Mr. Mason, hei pastor, and his family. Mr. Mason wished her to
close her house and go to reside with'his family, but she posi-
tively refused to leave the (ear old home. He left one of. his
daughters with her, until he succeeded in getting an old lady of
respectability to stay with her. To 'the outer world things
seemed to go on as usual at the cottage. There was the same
regularity in household affairs. The sanie poor families were
visited and supplied with the necessaries of life. Yet the elas-
ticity of her step was gone. Her cheeks grew daily paler and;

thinner, and her bright smile was never more seen. Her visits
to the prisoner continued, and there she' tried to seem hopeful,
and cheerful, to encourage the pale languid prisoner to hope, to
live for her sake. He still ne ded her strong faith to lean on,'and
she tried to keep up for his sake. He was her all now, and her
love was all that bound him to a world which had used him so
badly.-
September came, and with it the long, wished-for yet dreaded
court. By some mismanagement, some informality, the mur-
derer's case was again postponed. Six months longer! Eleven
months in prison, and six months more of hopeless confinement
yet before him! The sickly season was upon the town, and their
favorite physician in prison. Friends and the sufferers generally
begged for his release. Suffering, the presence of death in our
midst, wonderfully softens the human heart, and men who had
been ready to aid in every way in the prosecution of a man who
had never harmed them, now came forward and offered their
purses freely for his release  But the law was inexorable. Ethel's
pale face was seen beside the couches of the sick, and the con-
stant wish for Dr. Marshall pleased her more than anything else
could do.
Spring came again, and expectation was on tiptoe with regard
to the great murder case. People wondered.why Isabel King did
not return from her foreign tour to prosecute her brother's mur-
derer. Mr. Roberts said he had the power to act for her in all,
things. He'was busy and seemed anxious for the termination of
the affair. His means seemed to be freely offered to secure a ver-
dict against the prisoner.
The case was the first on docket, and was prosecuted vigorously.
The counsel for the defence made a most able effort, and one
which had a happy effect upon the jury, and thecrowd generally.
He brought up instances of circumstantial evidence, in which
the circumstances were even plainer (because the parties were
known to be at enmity,) than this one, which proved false in
time. Some men had been executed upon such evidence, and the
real murderer been found out years afterwards. He had just set-
tled a case for a friend which, though it did not involve the life
of any person, yet the happiness of two persons was well-nigh'
wrecked upon circumstantial evidence.

"A young friend of mine was betrothed to a lady every way
worthy of him, and preparations were going forward for a wed-
ding, five years ago. The lady resided in the country some dis-
tance from the city of R--, where he lived. She went with
"ome friends to the city to make some purchases for her bridal,
and he met her at the river-packet on which she had travelled.
Just as he handed her into the hack and was about to get in him-
self, he was accosted, and, turning to see who spoke, recognised a
friend from the South who was passing him hurriedly with his
left glove off. His eye caught sight of a ring on his finger which
caused him to tell the driver to wait a minute, and he soon over-
took and shook hands with his friend. The gentleman was in a
great hurry, but stopped a minute to exchange greetings. 'That
is a beautiful, but very uncommon ring you have on,' said my
friend. 'Yes,' he replied, 'a lady gave it to me last night, on
the packet.' Just then he was called off and was not seen again.
My friend returned to the hack and rode in silence to the hotel.
When he reached thehotel he asked her if she knew the gen-
tleman who accosted him. She replied that she did not. He
drew her glove from her hand and said: 'It is very strange that
you should give your ring to a perfect stranger.' 'I did not
give my ring to any one. Indeed I did not. I lost it last night.
I intended to tell you of it. It has made me miserable all the
morning. I dreamed, last night, that you were angry with me
and demanded the ring - that I returned it to you. When I
awoke this morning I was thankful 'twas only a dream; but
when I looked, behold, the ring was gone! The cabin was
thoroughly searched, and I offered to reward the maid hand-
somely if she found it for me. You, surely, cannot believe I
would give your ring away ? It is the last thing I would part
with,' and she burst into tears. He believed she did not speak
the truth, and felt no pity for her. 'Trifles light as air are, to
the jealous, confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ.' He was
naturally suspicious, and could not be persuaded that she told the
truth. They parted to meet no more for years; each feeling too
deeply wronged to seek a reconciliation, and both as miserable as
they could well be. Nine months ago I met with a party at a
hotel in our city, en route for the springs. They were from a

Southern State. The lady sat at my right band at the table, and
I observed her hand, which was a very beautiful one, but its,
chief attraction in my eyes'was a singularly shaped ring on her first
finger. It was just the pattern of the one my friend's betrothed
had so strangely lost. I had never seen another like it. When
we arose from the table I asked the gentknan if I might speak
with him a moment. He, very politely, bowed and accompanied
me to my room. 1 apologised for addressing a stranger, and at
once told him my friend's sad story, and ended by telling him the
ring his wife wore on her first finger was the exact counterpart
of the missing one. He laughed and said:  'It is a strange
story I have to tell you, sir - one which I have hitherto refrained
from telling lest it should be discredited. The ring may belong
to your friend. Is Mr. George Hancock that friend?' I bowed,
and he continued, 'I judged so from the fact that he observed it
on my finger, and made some remarks about its being an un-
common one on the morning after I became tile possessor of it.
I would have told him all about it, but was i a hurry. I was
married that morning, and left the State three hours after I met
him. Had I foreseen the consequences of my silence I should
have told him at any sacrifice. You know how the' packet boats
on the      river are constructed,'I suppose, and how the pas-
sengers sleep. Nothing but a'curtain divides the ladies' apart-'
ment from that of the gentlemen. On the night of September
18th, nearly five years ago, I slept on the boat with, my head
almost touching that of a lady. I did not. know or care who or
what she was. 'During the night she was very restless, seemed to
be suffering from troubled dreams - tossed her arms about, and
moaned several times. At length she began to talk rapidly, then
her hand thrust through an opening in the curtain and rested on
one of mine which was thrown over my head. She drew a ring
from her finger -and slipped it on mine, all the while muttering
something about~the ring. When she had done this she lay quietly
and I heard no more from her. I did not know what ,to do with
it. If I had told of the circumstances to any one it would have
made her feel badly. I did not know who.gave it to me, and
thought it best not to say anything about it, but kept it in a con-
spicuous. position during the hurry of leaving the boat. You

know we get off very early. I heard nothing said about a missing
ring. I gave it to my wife. She will be glad to restore -it to its
owner, with our best wishes for the future happiness of your
friends. Â°I hope the future may be so bright as to make amends
for the five years of trouble caused by the missing ring.
" I took the ring to my friend and told the story as 'twas told
to me. He was the happiest man I ever saw. 'It was not the
ring,' he said, 'but my Lelia's happiness which my cruel jeal-
ousy has wrecked.'                                     I
S5}I saw them married six months ago, and a happier couple I
s =y     never knew. Had I not met that party by mere accident, they
would have been miserable for life. Upon what a slender thread
hangs human happiness - ay, the very life of man ! "
The prisoner's noble bearing, his unblemished reputation, his
kindness of heart, his unselfish affection for his friend whom he
was accused of murdering, were feelingly dwelt upon. When the
case was given to the jury with the injunction, "if there is a
doubt, let the prisoner have the benefit of it," he leaned forward
eagerly, with blanched cheeks and clenched hands. In a few
minutes the jury returned, saying they could not agree on a ver-
dict; one was for hanging, some for imprisonment for the longest
term, and a few for release. Nothing could make them agree,
and as another jury could not be found then, the case was post-
poned until the fall term of court. The prisoner fainted as he was
ordered back, to jail; and Ethel was borne, weeping bitterly, to
her desolate home.
"They mean to wear my life out in this horrid place. They
know I am innocent, and wish to torture me to death," were the
impatient words of the prisoner. Mr. Mason tried to persuade
him that Providence was working for some good, but he could see
nothing but the enmity of man in it all. He had written to Isabel
King twice, and begged her, by the memory of the.past, to return
and do him' justice, for- she knew that he was innocent - she
knew her brother vas insane. He did not receive any reply, and
naturally supposed that she, too, was embittered against him -
her mind had been poisoned.

"All's well that ends well, yet;
Though time seem so adverse, and means unfit."--Shakspeare.

Our hero worried through another six months, and another
time for trial had colme. The case was called. Everything was
in readiness. Mr. Roberts gave in his testimony with distinct-
ness, and in such a way as to imply more than he said--though he
said enough to leave no doubt upon the minds of the jury as to.
the guilt of the prisoner.  The counsel for the defence declined
to address the court, but' simply wished to introduce a very'im-
portant witness. Then motioning to Dr. Hall, he took his seat.
The old doctor retired for a moment and returned with a lady,
closely veiled, upon his arm. When'she reached the witness.
stand she threw back her veil, and turned her eyes full upon Mr.
Roberts, who cowered before her gaze ; then turning to the
prisoner, she fell upon her knees before him and cried : "Poor
Arthur ! how you have suffered !" and she bowed her proud head,
while her whole frame shook with convulsive sobs. He started
violently, then dropping his head on her shoulder, said, " I did
not kill your brother, dear Bell. God knows I did not, I loved
him even as you did." She arose and said, " I know it, Arthur;
and I know too that you have been deeply wronged. I come to-
right the wrong." She turned her splendid eyes upon the Judge
and lawyers, as she said, "I come, my friends, to do an act of
justice. I am ignorant of the forms of law. Let ine tell my
story in my own way. I have been an unobserved listener to
Mr. Roberts' testimony; also to Dr. Marshall's statement.i He-
has told you the whole truth. I did send for him the day he
mentioned to try to find out the nature of my poor brother's
malady. His reception by my brother was just what he stated.
I knew that Henry loved Ethel Lee, and had addressed her and
been rejected, previous to her engagement with Dr. Marshall. I.
am surprised to hear the rumors afloat respecting her. She is
above reproach, as pure as an angel, and I would have preferred
her above all others as my brother's wife. I do not blame her for
rejecting him, as she loved another.. It only goes to prove her
true nobility of soul that she was not guided by mercenary

motives. I saw that my brother felt her rejection keenly, as he
loved her truly ; still he tried to be cheerful. He kept up an ap-
pearance of resignation until a week before the time appointed
for the marriage., Then he became irritable and moody, at times
boisterously gay. We were to act as attendants, and I mentioned
the fact to him. He started wildly, then said, with a strange
light in his .eye: 'No, no. I can't do that. I would prefer her
choosing Arthur to any one else, but I can't see her married. Oh,
Bell! I wish I was dead.' I tried to reason with him, and thought
I had succeeded in quieting his feelings. He retired, and the next
day was confined to his room with a nervous headache. During
the afternoon his symptoms became rather alarming, and I sent
for Dr. Marshall. Perhaps I did wrong in sending for him, but he
had always seemed glad to see. him-had shown no unkind
feelings toward him. My father was Arthur's guardian, and we
were raised together like one family. Arthur's appearance in his
room set him to raving. He left, and I sent for Mr. Roberts, our
nearest neighbor, to stay with my brother and watch him during
the night. I felt an unusual fear of being alone with the servants.
Henry continued to rave until about nine o'clock, when he became
quiet, and we thought him asleep. I saw very plainly that he
was insane, but hoped it would wear 'off, without exposure to the
neighborhood. I walked out on the porch, Mr. Roberts followed
me. Ie had made me an offer of his hand once and been re
jected, .My brother did not like him, though he did not particu-
larly dislike him. When he followed me that night, I was stand-
ing in the moonlight very sad. He renewed his offer, and told
me I needed a protector. He had never thought of addressing
any other lady since his wife died;- and thought my brother's
situation, his insanity, would prevent my doing better, as people
might think us enough alike to believe I would become insane
also. His audacity and coarseness angered me, and I told him I
sent for .him to attend my sick brother, not to jnsult me. He
begged pardon, and returned to my brother's room. I went to
the door and found my brother asleep. Mr. Roberts told me I
had better retire; if anything was needed he would have me
awakened. I retired to my room, but could not sleep. I did not
undress. I felt too restless. About ten o'clock I went to my

brother's door, and heard him talking about Ethel Lee. I heard
Mr. llberts say ,t him, 'I would not let that pale doctor cut me
out so. No doubt he did all he could to keep her from liking
you.' I tapped at the door, and Mr. Roberts opened it. I said
to him,'For pity's sake try to soothe Henry to sleep; don't ex-
cite him." I then went to him and asked him if his head was
easier. He put his arm around my neck and said: 'Do you love
me, Bell; would it grieve you much if I were to die?' I kissed
him, and replied, 'Don't talk about dying, brother; you will soon
be well-then we will take that long talked of trip to visit our rela-
tions in Europe. You know I love you better than any one in
the world; go to sleep now, and you will be better to-morrow.'
' To-morrow!I' he cried, 'yes, to-morrow ! It is her wedding.
day.' He sank back on his pillow with a moan; then he said:
'Kiss me once more, dear sister; kiss me, and good-night. I gm
going to sleep.' I kissed him again. He held me tightly to his
breast a minute, then released me, and said: 'Go to bed now.'
I went out on the porch, and stood there a while. I returned to
his door and found all quiet; then I retired, and was soon in a
troubled sleep, from which I was awakened about twelve o'clock.
by Mr. Roberts running in to the house and calling to me that my
brother had killed himself down at the river. I went out in the
hall and asked where he was. He replied: 'At the river ; Arthur
is with him. I want help to bring the body'home. I saw him
stab himself. Arthur was going home 'from Mrs. Lee's and rode
up near the bluff, when he heard Henry groan and got down from
his horse and went to him. He got to him just before I did. He
was dead when Arthur drew the knife out of his body.' Arthur
has told you the balance of that fearful night; how I fainted at
the sight of the body. Mr. Roberts has told it that I knew
Arthur was guilty, and went away leaving my business..in his
hands, with the request that no money should be spared in the
prosecution. I was very ill for several weeks-delirious nearly
all the time. I was surprised to find that Dr. Hall wasnot per-
mitted to see me, but one from a distant county was in attend-.
ance. No one was admitted to my room but servants and this
strange doctor, when it was given out that I had left for Europe.
I did go to Europe, but not until Mr. Robert told me that

Arthur had been examined and released, that he had called to see
me several times, and would be married soon, that the marriage
was postponed for a few weeks on account of the death of my
brother. He seemed so very kind and considerate I almost for-
gave him for his rudeness. Then I was as helpless as an infant, so
I let him make all necessary arrangements, and I was put into a
carriage on a bed, before I could sit up, and taken to the steamer.
I was too ill to mix with the passengers, and kept my state-room
all the way to New York. He hired a white woman in Charles-
ton to accompany me to New York and attend me while there.
I gained my strength rapidly, and in a week was, on board a
vessel bound for Liverpool. I reached there safely, and met my
relations, with whom I have been staying since that time. I
wrote several times to Arthur, asking him to attend to my affairs,
but received no answer. I wrote to Ethel, also enclosing a letter
for Arthur. I wrote to Arthur.from New York, and sent him a
check for five thousand dollars as a bridal present. I have heard
that he received nothing, and has written to me several times. I
received no letter from America except 'from Mr. Roberts. He
always mentioned Ethel and Arthur. I never -dreamed that he
was in prison at all, or I should never have left America. By
mere accident I picked up an American paper in London, and
saw the whole proceedings of the great murder trial, with Mr.
Roberts' testimonyin full. I started home immediately, and met
-Mr. Armstrong, Arthur's counsel, in Charleston. I can't imagine
why Mr. Roberts should have acted as he has done, unless it be
for gain. I told him I intended to transfer my brother's interest
in my father's estate to Arthur, as I was just of age. I knewmy
father intended to give him something in his will, but died sud-
denly. My brother and I had ofte      oken of. it, and were
waiting for my majority, when I could make a right to, a portion
of my part. If he thought he could win my affections by such
duplicity, he is mistaken. It is very evident that he has sought to
ruin Dr. Marshall, even to take his life. Arthur is as much my
brother, except the blood, as Henry was, and I love him as such.
You do. not blame your sister Bell now, do you, Arthur ?"
Arthur arose and clasped her in his arms, while such a shout as
had never been heard went up from that court-room. Order was

after a while restored, when it was found that Mr. goberts, taking
advantage of the confusion, had slipped out, unperceived, and
could not be found. The jury returned a verdict of " not guilty '
without quitting their seats. The last that was heard of Mr.
Roberts he was seen by some one on. board a vessel bound to the
East Indies. His estate was sold and hit children taken by some
relative in a distant State.
I need nottell of Ethel's happiness, it was too pure and deep
for description, when Isabel folded her in her arms and said :" I
did not know until to-day how deeply you have suffered. God
bless you, dear Ethie, you are a t ue, noble woman, and will make
Arthur a good wife. You cannot know how happy I am n1in
giving him to you."
A week later there was a quiet wedding in the little cottage
parlor, when Mr. Armstrong and Isabel King were the only at-
tendants, except Mr. Mason and family and Dr. Hall. Isabel had
the papers all prepared, in which she deeded half of her estate to
Arthur Marshall. He refused to accept it. "I have your confi-
dence and affection, sweet sister, which is worth more than money."
He could not prevent her from placing twenty thousand dollars
in bank subject to his order. Isabel made Arthur's home hers for
a few months, when Mr. Armstrong, the talented young lawyer,
took her to his city home, where she reigns as queen over his
splendid establishment. Her beauty and goodness make her many
friends, but none more loving than the little family at the Cottage.
Did Dr. Marshall feel as kindly disposed toward his fellow-men
as before his incarceration ? The reader cannot blame him if the
bitterness of spirit lasted months, and the demon of distrust was
only exorcised by the two angels of his household. Some who
had professed great friendship were the first to believe him guilty;
then when the great reaction took place, could he feel perfect con-
fidence in their professions of sympathy ?

"such is the patriot's boast, where'er he roam,
His first, best country ever is at home."-Goldsmith's Traveller.
" The events of our war were too horrible to admit of such a
tender sentiment as love. There was too much of dreadful reality
to- make room for romance."--New York Paper.
No romance in such a war as ours, did you say? With due
deference for the opinions of one so much wiser than I, I beg
leave to differ with you. Pity, though not love, is very nearly al-
lied with that holiest of all'passions: and when pity for the suf-
ferings, and admiration for the deeds of valor of our soldiers are
combined, the feeling amounts to a worship almost. A sentiment
perfectly irresistible: hence you see such frequent illustrations of
the truth of the adage, that " none but the brave deserve the fair."
While some of our maidens were content to make happy the poor
exempts, a larger proportion have given their hands and hearts to
bold soldier boys. Let all skeptics read my plain, unvarnished
story. They will agree with me that the four years of horrible
war contained, or developed, more plots for romance than could
have been known in forty years of peace. 0 yes, I can prove to
you that Southern chivalry is not dead yet. If any Southerners
from other States should chance to read my simple story, I hope
they will not take umbrage at my caption. Believe me, it is not
from lack of obligation to you or admiration of your deeds that I
select South Carolina from among the number, but from the fact
that this is not all fiction, for my hero is no myth, but a veritable
soldier from the Palmetto State.

Though small she nry be, she's as brave as the best.

And we honor Hampton's cavalry, who did such noble service
in our Old Dominion. From that intrepid band we select a
youthful Lieutenant as our hero.
To make my story intelligible, I must go back to the spring of
1863. The facts I here narrate are well known to every citizen.
between Chancellorsville and the South Side Railroad. Soon
after, or rather immediately succeeding that memorable battle in
which our country lost her noble Jackson, while public excitement
was at its highest, the citizens of the counties between the points
mentioned above were surprised and incensed at, the appearance
of a large body of cavalry. Stoneman and his inhuman Dutch.-
men, " the brute made ruler and the man made brute," attempted
to make their way across the country in order to cut off commu-
nication with Richmond. Their plan was, I believe, to tear up
the aqueducts at Columbia across the Rivanna, and at Byrd Creek,
on the James River Canal, but they failed to accomplish anything
more than a destruction of private property, which they had very
little inclination to respect. So after robbing hen-roosts, fright-
ening women and children, and stealing negro clothing, &amp;c., feel-
ing a mortal fear of Stuart's cavalry, they decamped, leaving be-
hind them, in the hearts of the wives and daughters, sisters and
sweethearts of Confederate soldiers, a hatred lasting as life and
strong as death.
Our government, fearful that they might be sufficiently cour-
ageous to cross the river and attempt the destruction of the High
Bridge on the South Side road, sent troops up the south side of
the river to intercept them.

among them created as great consternation as did Falstaff's ragged

der, then, that the brave Southern soldiers were feasted and flat-
tered, smiled upon by the fairest of  's fair daughters, who
never wearied in their attentions to the wants, real or imaginary,
of their defenders; and many left sad hearts behind them. Soie
returned and took their brides to the bright sunny South, ere the
close of the war. Some waited till the war was over, while some
in whose cases was verified the saying, " Out of sight, out of
mind," made fair promises which they never intended to. keep.
Tut these were rare cases. There were firm friendships formed
which time and the chances of war have only served to strengthen,
and delightful interchange of thoughts and sentiments with some
whose names go to make up the long list of martyrs for freedom's
cause. Their names live in our hearts, and will live on the
bloodiest page of history. With Ossian, we say to our pppressors
"Thou lookest from thy towers to-day ; yet a few years, and the
blast of the desert comes ; it howls in thy empty court, and
whistles round thy half-worn shield. And let the blast of the
desert come ! We shall be renowned in our day! The mark of
our arm shall be in the battle, our name in the song of bards."

A lady, the wonder of her kind,
whose form was upborne by a lovely mind
Which, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion
Like a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean.
"I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet
Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;
I doubt not they felt thespirit that came-
From her glowing fingers through all their frame."
This maiden was Ella Morrison-a modest, retiring girl of
se\renteen; the pet of her father, who cherished her as the last
link which bound him to life; a fair, fragile creature, delicate, yet
lithe and graceful in her. figure. That frail form enshrined a
spirit superior to that of many more hardy-looking damsels, and
that small but finely shaped head was. a  casket containing a
jewel of rare value. Her mind was richly stored with wisdom.
Mr. Morrison was a finely educated man, and instructed his
daughter as he would have done his son, the shock of whose early
death he had never entirely recovered from. In his daughter's
tuitio n he hid not forgotten those lighter accomplishments which
so much adorn a lady -,music, drawing, &amp;c., in which she had
efficient teachers. A dear lover of poetry and the ideal, his daugh-
ter, while inheriting from him this passion, had his example to
guide her in he r choice of reading matter. They lived in a little
world of their own.    To them    their library was " dukedom
large enough."   Mr. Miorrison had once been wealthy, but bad
health, together with family afflictions, crippled his energies,
while they made sadinroads upon his purse, whose strings were
never held with a niggard hand. He found that he could not
keep up appearances as a man of wealth, so he sold out every-
thing except a small farm, on which he had a neat cottage built,
and spent his time in the pursuits of agriculture. His wife had
died when Ella was only fourteen,.leaving her tender floweret to
his care, well knowing that he was as well qualified for the task
as any man could be.
He determined to try to build up her constitution as well as
form her mind. Therefore, lhe encouraged her to ride on horse-
back until she became the best equestrian in the neighborhood;-
and he was amply satisfied with the roses planted in her cheeks
after "brushing the dew from the upland lawn."    He took her

into the garden and required her assistance in setting plants or
dropping seeds, .by which means she soon became able to super-
intend the planting as well as the cooking of vegetables; and,
while aiding in the preservation of her health, she was becoming
a notable housewife. Her father's constant companion, it had
never entered into his head that she needed other society than his
and that of her cousin, Nora Stanhope, a gay young lady of nine-
teen, who had shared the advantages of Ella's education, with the
addition of two years at a fashionable boarding school, from which
she had returned not spoiled, but a little giddy and very wilful,
perhaps not a little vain, from the score of compliments she was
constantly receiving from as many young men.
Living as Ella did, among her books and flowers, caring{ little
for other sources of amusement, receiving but few visitors', it is
not strange that she saw none of the soldiers camped near her.
While many delicacies, as well as necessaries, found their way
from her house to the camp, none of the soldiers found the way
to her retired domicil; and they came and went in total ignorance
of the gentle floweret blooming in the adjacent forest. I know
my readers will think I am getting this young lady into a situa-
tion where she will never be known, and I think I hear some
novel-reading Miss exclaim: "What do you want with her? I
thought you were going to make her meet, by mere accident, one
of those Southern soldiers, and have a nice story of love at first
sight, an intuitive knowledge of congeniality which would lead to
confessions of love."' To all such I say wait awhile and you will
see that "the race is not always to the swift."

from May' 1863 to January 1864 -at which time a letter was.

sage to the effect that it had lain -in the office.at that place for
nearly eight months, and failing to find an owner, and knowing
of no one who was connected with the Purcell family except her-
self, had taken the liberty to send it to her. She very readily sur-
mised from the post-mark that it was from a soldier who had evi-
dently been mistaken in some one's name, or been wilfully led
astray. Inquiries were made in the neighborhood for some time,
and no one coming forward and proving property, she .consulted

her father, who told her there could be no impropriety in opening
the letter, as by so doingshe might -possibly find out for whom it
was intended. She opened it, and read as follows:
Miss Jane PurceU:-Although the cloud of war darkens our
once fair Southern sky, and, gentle peace and innocence have given
place to cruel strife and unjust oppression, we are.often reminded
of those dear tender ties which bind us to life, and without which

Ella thought over the letter for a few days, and caine to the
conclusion that as no one could be found by that name, it would
be a pity for the poor fellow to losehis labor, and saw no reason
why she might not take the name for a short time. She had
never seen him, and in all probability never would, and she
thought such a correspondence would serve to amuse her, and
might instruct her in army movements; .besides by encouraging
him to write again, she might find out who Jane Purcell really

where you may be. I write at a venture. There has been hard
fighting since you were in this county, and you may have retired
to your far Southern home, leaving an amputated limb in the Old
Dominion. Having heard so many names, I hope you will pardon
me if I fail to remember your personal appearance. If you
should consider it worth your while to write again, I would be
pleased to have a description of yourself, so as to quicken my
memory. As I am not sure you will get this, I will not write at
length this time, but promise something better for the future.

Thus' was begun a correspondence which increased in interest
for several months. Any scruples which Ella might have had
gradually disappeared, until she found herself looking for the
coming of the mails with intense interest, .and responding to the
letters with as much pleasure as if she knew her unknown corres-
pondent personally, perhaps more so; and as though she. were
really what she assumed to be. No one was permitted to enter
into this cherished secret. Thus was she going on, blindly, until
a letter came to her bearing the name, but entirely different in
style, orthography, penmanship ; everything as different as could
be, in which Mr. Morton made her an offer of his hand and for-
tune, and saying he "had no objections to an exchange 6f

Forgetting that she had, by thus writing to an entire stranger,
taking the place of another, laid herself liable to receive anything
he chose to write to her, and following the dictates of her own
outraged feelings, she wrote a few hurried lines, stating that when
she began the-correspondence, she. did so under the conviction
that he was a gentleman and a scholar whose letters would afford
her amusement as well as instruction. Since she had found out
that he was neither the one nor the other, she hoped he would not
trouble her with any more communications from his pen ; and en-
closed his letter.

A fate attends on all I write."--Pope.
In vain did Ella essay to forget her vexation at the reception
of Mr. Morton's last letter. The thought; that she had but paved
the way was galling to her modesty, and she resolved to write to
no one again without her father's knowledge and sanction. She
had but one source of consolation, which was the fact that her
name was not known in, the affair, no one in the neighborhood
knowing anything about-it except the postmaster, who was an old
and trusty friend. ' We will see how her resolution was kept.
Ten days after her letter was written she received the following
letter, written in the style of former letters-at least the same
handwriting:
CAMP OF 1ST S. C. CAVALRY,
Near Columbia, S. C.
iss Purcell:-'I scarcely know how to commence this feeble
epistle. If I did not, deem my past ungallant conduct demanded'
an explanation, I would certainly give up in despair. I think I
cannot do better than by using the following egotistic style.
Mr. Morton came to me in the spring of 1863, and asked me to
write a letter for him, and you may know I readily acquiesced
when he promised to let me see the answer, if any ever came.
When your reply was received, it threw me into raptures of de-.
light. I corresponded with some ladies in Virginia, but yours,
in Morton's name, gave me more pleasure than all the rest, and I
often wished I could sign my own name instead of his. I was
absent on duty when he wrote his unfortunate letter. He is very
miserable, and insists on my writing you in. his name, but I have
declined positively, and have registered a vow never to be guilty,
of such ungallant conduct again. He is a perfect child of nature.
I would have hailed such a rupture in the correspondence with
delight, had I remained in Virginia ; but as I have left that noble
old State, I feel myself beyond all hope of redemption. I have
hitherto been able to compare my heart to a rock in the (ocean,
against which the breakers continually dash without making any
im pression. ,I must admit that this last surge of the fickle god-

dess' ill-favored wave has made it to totter in its firm foundation,
though it is no more than was deserved by a young outlaw from
the Military Institute of this State, from whose time-honored
walls I was expelled in 1861 to join the army, against the Wishes
of my kind old father. For thus disgracing myself, and being a
good, easy somebody, after the Pennsylvania campaign of last
year, my comrades were whimsical enough to confer on me the
rack of senior second lieutenant, and you know the weight of
such heavy honors! was more than sufficient to turn the head of a
young jackanapes like.myself, not then out of my teens. There-
fore, I pray you, throw the veil of charity over my unknightly
conduct. I am a pauvre oyster-fed cavalryman, and not worthy
of your anger or contempt. May God bless you and make you
happy, is the-earnest wish of      ROBERT G. WILLIAMsÂ°.
When this letter was received Ella was both astonished and
pleased. Here was romance. The only difficulty was, how could
it be continued ? She thought over it for two days, and all her
resolutions never to write to another stranger vanished before her
love of adventure. Still she could not think of signing her own
name. Therefore she went with all her difficulties to her cousin
Nora Stanhope, to whom she told the whole story, and how much
she wished to continue the correspondence, yet shrunk from
giving her true name, while she felt it would not be right to con-
tinue the name of Janie Purcell. Nora was in raptures. She
read all of the letters, and declared them splendid. She had sev-
eral soldier correspondents, but nothing in her experience could
equal this. She had been reading Macaria, which had just come
out, and made her head ache over Irene's scientific words. They
were regular brain-splitting jaw-crackers, and she was delighted
to find something to divert her thoughts from such self-sacrificug
heroines, and gave her full and fire consent for her name to be
used, always provided she was to -know how it was carried on,
and be first bridesmaid in ase anything serious ever came of it.
"Ali! Mabelle cousin," she said, " I have imagined you a heroine
after the Irene and Beulah order, but am really pleased to find
you flesh and blood, after 'all. '.A fellow-feeling makes us won-
drous kind,' and I am glad to find that' your heart is not stone,

and you have a little of woman's peculiar prerogative, curiosity. I
detest these model women, or rather monstrosities, such as Miss
Evans makes of her heroines. God never made a woman such as
Irene. You know I dislike a sniveller an croaker, still I would
prefer a Niobe' all tears to a woma v1o never enjoyed that
luxury. Why I actually shed tears -over the description of the
death-bed scene of' only a private in the ranks,' while Irene held
the head of her dying lover while all around were in tears, without
so much as a moistening of her eyelids. I know what you would
tell me, that the sorrow that cannot find v'nt in tears is deepest.
I grant all that, still the fountains of the great deep must be
broken up sooner or later ; human nature cannot. long bear such
an unnatural strain pr violation of her laws."
Ella replied that she had " no inclination to imitate Miss
Evans' heroines. Had circumstances thrown me into society as
much as they have you, I should id all probability have been as
much of a flirt as you are, always provided I had': been as much
complimented.- I hope, however, my heart would have retained
as much of goodness as yours, and my poor giddy brain no more
warped. You are really - a dear, good cousin, and I   dily
prfiise you all you ask."
Writing materials were prqduced, and the following lett r was
written and given to Noi to have mailed:
Lieutenant W lliams: --Truly these rebel days a "e full of
wonders. I have heard many strange and romantic incidents of.
the war, but I venture to affirm that few can exceed; this of our.
correspondence. I cannot .nd it in my heart to be angry with

with regard to the part you have acted in our little by-play. Had
the correspondence continued in Mr. Morton's name, I should, in
all probability, have remained Janie Purcell until tired of the name
and then dropped it with the correspondence. Your confession
is very, very interesting, and I feel some. reluctance at parting
with such pleasant-company, for your letters have served to en-

tertain one who would otherwise have been very lonely at times
and had become welcome friends ; but as I said, I have a con-
fession to make, and will do so at once. I think this much is due
to you as well as to myself, after which I will bid you au revoirif
you wish it.
During the month of January,1864, a letter was sent me by
the postmaster at -----, directed to Miss Jane Purcell. - As he
- said it had been there eight months, and as I had some relatives
by the name of Purcell, he thought I might know for whom it
was intended. I have some family connections by that name, but
not a Jane among the number, and none of them belong to this
county. I have tried, by inquiries among my neighbors, and no
one seems to remember Mr. Morton. As I had been unsuccessful in
finding out Mr. M.'s inamorata, and having no correspondent in
the army, and being possessed of a sort of monomania known as
cacoethes scribendit- and besides thinking, as. I still do, that some
one had used that name to deceive Mr. Morton, I concluded to
adopt the name, and write in answer to his letter. I knew he had
never seen me, as I saw none of the soldiers Who came to our
county; therefore, I hope his wounds are not mortal. I feel now
that I did wrong in. treating him as I have done, though I only
felt at the beginning as if it was a girlish frolic. You know how
the affair has been carried on. I must confess that some of my
most pleasant hours were spent in reading those letters intended
for some one else. I hope you are not a Papist, but if you are
and have any more sins to confess, you are at liberty to confess
them to
Your romantic correspondent,
NORA STANHOPE.
As she had hoped, her letter elicited the following response:

Miss Nora Stanhope:
Yours of the 14th instant was handed to me on yesterday,
upon my return from a short visit to my good old home. The
contents of your letter are romantic in the extreme, and my feel-

gave me much greater pleasure than if it had been expected. I
am no Papist, but, on the contrary, a descendant of the Huguenots,
who were driven from their " belle France " by the persecutions
of the former. This is true, so far as history is concerned ; but I
would count myself happy if, by turning Papist, I could have
such a fair priestess as thou art. Willingly, gladly, would I go
to my confession. You will probably think I am very presump-
tive to express in such awkward terms my admiration of your
personal charms, when I am unknown to you; bt pray excpse
my simplicity in believing that none but a beautiful lady can be
so generous and kind to one unknown. Providence permitting, I
shall visit Virginia when this cruel war is over, and hope to have
the pleasure of meeting Miss Stanhope. Now I am only a poor
sea-coast soldier, and dare not hope for a continuance of this very
interesting correspondence, much as I may desire it.
We are now .to the right and front of Charleston, and receive
occasionally a bombshell, which makes a great noise, but seldom
does any damage. We were visited by the Yankees an person
last Sunday, but, after a slight.skirmish, they retired. The cas-
ualties on our side amounted to five or six. Our cavalry, as in-
fantry, was engaged. We are acting solely as infantry--turn out
on picket nightly. The siege is progressing, regularly, and even
now the calm Sabbath is being interrupted by the deep-mouthed
roar of friendly and hostile guns.
t- I am called off, and have only time to add that I have read
your letter over and over again, and instead of its appearing as a
twice-told tale, I admire it more and more. Would it be asking
too much to beg you will write again to
Yours, with respect and admiration,
ROBERT G WILLIAMS.
The summer and fall of, 1864 were passed disastrously to the
Confederate cause. Defeat after defeat followed each other in.
quick succession. Charleston held out bravely against her be-
siegers.' The first S. C. cavalry still acted as infantry, and all the
fall and winter Lieutenant Williams still found time to carry on
the correspondence with, as he supposed, Nora Stanhope. . During
the fall he sent her his photograph. His letters had become very

friendly and complimentary, but he was waiting for a sigh of her
face to declare a warmer sentiment. She had promised to' return
the compliment by forwarding her picture as soon as she had an
opportunity to have it taken. On the 18th of February Charleston
was evacuated by the Confederates, and occupied by Federal forces.
All communication by mail was cut off, so that all hope of hearing
from Lieutenant Williams was gone, and Ella gave herself up to
her books and flowers, and her housekeeping, as before. Nora
alone knew her secret, and she alone could sympathise with her,
though Ella tried very hard to make even that one friend believe
she cared nothing for him; that she only wrote to him for the
pleasure it afforded to receive a letter from the army. Still, she
missed those messengers of kindly feeling, and very frequently
found herself wondering if he were alive, and if so, would he ever
come to Virginia ?
CHAPTER IV.
" And did they return no more?" said Utha's bursting sigh. "Fell the mighty
in battle, and did Crimora live? Her steps were lonely, hei soul was sad for
Connal."-088 au.
The fall of Charleston was but the prelude to that grand march
which was anything but music to us; the general breaking up of
our armies ; the advent among us of provost guards, Freedmen's
Bureau, and all the host of Yankee cruelties and devices-that
wicked time when
"Each wanton judge new penal statutes drew."
Those were the days that tried men's souls, and women's too;
for, if the men had to take all sorts of nauseous doses in the shape
of amnesty oaths, etc., the ladies had to put up with insolence
from former servants, and in many instances had to do all their
household work, while paying their slaves regular wages. It was
a matter of wonder how those daughters of luxury, so tenderly
and delicately reared, could yield so gracefully to the force of .cir-
cumstances, thereby giving so little cause to their tyrannical con-
querors to rejoice over our downfall, proving that whatever the
fate of our country might be, her women were not conquered.

While Ella and her father saw no "rebel " soldiers, they were
not so fortunate with regard to the Yankees, and Mr. Morrison
being an uncompromising States Rights man, he suffered 11o little-
from their impertinence in thrusting themselves, unbidden, upon
his privacy, at all times. Ella was very much annoyed and in-
convenienced, and but rarely left her father's room. But all things
must have an end, and the Yankees were withdrawn ; the negroes
or a portion of them, went to work; the farmers did what they
could and ,made tolerably good crops.
The autumn passed, and winter came once more, and with it
came a spirit of frolicking such as had not been known in that
quiet neighborhood for many years. Ella, now nearly nineteen,
was persuaded to go intosociety. Nora got her uncle on her side,
and Ella niade her debut under that young lady's chaperonage,
and soon became quite gay and very much admired. In all these
months there was a name hidden away in her heart, though she
had begun to think of him as dead. Now, real.suitors pressed
forward to claim her hand, still she could not thrust out that
pleasant memory. Was he among the slain? or did he only carry
on that correspondence, as she had begun it, merely as a pleasant
pastime, to be dropped when he grew weary ? and had he become
weary and gla of an excuse to discontinue it-? were questions
she asked herseX every day. That handsome photograph was
often admired an sighed over, when no one saw her. But she
was learning some worldly wisdom, and could conceal her real
feelings so well that all who knew her thought her very light.
hearted, and as free in thought as the birds,, while those who
sought to win her affections came to the conclusion that she had
no heart. Thus passed the winter. Nora Stanhope was affianced
to a very worthy man, though the marriage would not be con-
summated before the fall.. It was a very pleasant March afternoon.
Nora had gone to spend the night with Ella. Soon -after her ar-
rival, a young man, who was once rejected by Ella, made his ap-
pearance. He had been persuaded by Nora to try again, as she
thought her cousin might be induced to change her mind. She had
used every art of persuasion of which.she was mistress to prevail
on Ella to accept him, and her reply was, "I will try to like him
for your sake.'' And she had been trying in vain for the last

month to love him. He had come this evening for his final an-
swer. Ella was hardly herself; she was restless and unusually
serious, and, there. was an unnatural moisture about her long eye-
lashes, which did not escape Nora's penetrating gaze, and she took
an opportunity to whisper to her not to do anything she would
regret afterwards. Nora proposed that they should walk to meet
her brother, who had gone to the postoffice, and when they started
she purposely fell behind with a book.
Mr. Adams and Ella walked in silence for some time; at length
he asked her if she had changed her mind, and was prepared to
give him a favorable answer. She replied in a low, but firm
tone:
" I wish you had not asked me this. I value your friendship
very highly, but I believe I have no heart to bestow. I have tried
to -love you, because I esteem you very much more than any one
else I have seen, and my friends like you, still I cannot love you
as you deserve to be loved. Let me be your friend; but, I pray
you, do not again ask me to be more."
Just then Nora's brother came meeting them, and, to the query
"Any letters? " replied :" Yes, some for sister." They retraced
their steps, and met Nora, who was behind them. As she took
her letters, her glance felli'on one post-marked Savannah, which
she broke open, and finding it from Lieutenant Williams, she said,
quietly:
"Here, Nell, you may read this while I look at the others."
Surprised at Nora's liberality, she took the letter, when the
handwriting attracting her eye, she hastily glanced at the name,
when she turned deadly pale, and caught Nora's arm for support.
One look was sufficient to prove to Nora the state of Ella's hea t,-
but she wisely held her tongue, and, taking her place by Mr.
Adams' side, left Ella to read her letter. We will look over her
shoulder, although it is a very impolite trick, and see what he has
to say for himself. It is not long enough, to weary our patience :
g'fiss Nora tanhope :-It has been such -a long, dull time since
I heard from you, that I can scarce muster up courage to attempt
to re-open a correspondence with you - a correspondence which
was so profitable and interesting to me in the "oldreb days." I

would have written to you long ago, but had very little hope of,
being able to contrive a letter to your portion of Virginia. We
have no means of communication except through .the military in
the country, and I presume that such is the state of affairs in your
State. however, I will venture the epistle, with the hope of again
hearing from Miss Stanhope, and if the worst must come, even
from Mrs.-.
I remained true to the Confederacy until the Hillsboro, or
Bennet House surrender, and came out of the war without having
received any dangerous wound. When I reached home, I found
that the Yankees had been before me, having burnt out and de-
stroyed to the best of their ability. By this time, however, we
have partially re-built, and enjoy comparative comfort. I have
written the above with very little spirit, as I have but small hope
that it will ever reach you. If it should be so fortunate, write
soon and cheer me up. I am keeping bachelor's hall, and need
your inspiring messenger.
With much respect,     ROBERT G. WILLIAMS.
The first transport of joy over, Ella began to consider the
probability that Nora might refuse to let her name be used again,
as she was engaged., Nora's mind was busy on the same subject,
and she concluded, that if she could not persuade Ella to tell him
the truth at once, she would permit her name to be used a while
longer. She could not bear to spoil such a splendid romance, and
she would like to see what would come of it. Her consent was
given and Ella soon sent an answer, and the correspondence thus
renewed, continued for several months without interruption. To
show how our hero and heroine were progressing I will merely
say, the formality of their first letters was discarded, and such be-
sinnings as " Ma Chere Amie," and " My Much Esteemed Friend,"
&amp;c., substituted in their stead. I will here make a extract from
a letter of his, the last: " Early in June, '63, merely to oblige,
another, I wrote a letter to a lady whom I had never seen or heard
of. It is useless to dwell on the result, how names were changed,
and how the present time finds me pleasantly employed in writing
to this now accomplished lady and friend. Three years have gone
into the void of time, and our delightful.correspondence is'still

unmarred. Is that all ? Will this romance ever 'point a moral
or adorn a tale ?' Is there aught behind the curtain ? Let it be
as it may, as soon as I can get one day's march ahead of poverty,
I shall see Miss Stanhope."
Nora's marriage was now but a month off, and she tried to
persuade Ella to make one more confession, as she could not con-
sent for her name to be used in such a way when she was mar-
ried. But poor little coward, she could not tell him all lest he
would think she was still trying to deceive him. If she could see
him she could make him understand her motives for such de-
ception, but she dare not hope for anything but contempt at this
late day. She preferred breaking off the correspondence, painful
as, it would be. Therefore, she waited until a -few days before
Nora's marriage, then she sent him a wedding card without a
word of explanation or regret ; thereby leaving him to think her,
what she most detested, a heartless coquette. The wedding
passed off gayly with one exception. Poor Ella ! she was reaping
the reward of her cowardice.
Acting as first bridesmaid, she naturally claimed a large share
sof attention, and she was so purely beautiful; her pure white
complexion rivalling the fleecy white'of he- dress. She was very
pale, and a pensive sadness, painful to her friends, rested on her
lovely brow.
A schoolmate, and very dear friend of Nora's, officiated as
second bridesmaid. To know Lizzie Irby was to love her. A.
petite and graceful figure, a broad, white brow, mild 'blue-gray
eyes, betokening soul as well as intellect, a small, beautifully
shaped, mouth, whose firmly compressed lips expressed as plainly
as lips could do decision of character, while they could wreathe
with smiles, showing two charming dimples at the corners, to
which add a heart full of kind feeling to every living thing, and a
childlike innocence and joyousness, and you have her picture in
full.
She and Ella were irresistibly drawn toward each other, and
during two weeks spent together they became firm friends. Lizzie
was quite demonstrative in her - affections, and dearly loved a
pet name. Ella was "Nellie dear " with her, as she thought
Nellie a much softer and sweeter name than Ella. She wondered.

what could make her dear friend so pensive, and she questioned
Nora on the subject, who feeling bound to keep the secret, said
she was afraid Ella was going into a decline. She felt very un-
easy about her. Her mother had died of consumption.
Lizzie left for home, and her affectionate letters were a source
of real pleasure to Ella, whose cheeks were growing paler, form
more ethereal and step slower. Her father was seriously alarmed
at her appearance, and proposed a visit to Lizzie, as he thought a
change might be beneficial to her health. About that time a let-

serves a separate chapter.

"You doubtless remember my showing you a picture of a sol-

Will you not tire, dear Nellie, with reading the story of that pic-
ture? Trusting to your good nature, and knowing your love for
the romantic, I will tell you a true love story."
During the summer of 1862 1 was in Richmond with some
friends, who proposed visiting the hospitals. I shall never forget
that morning, for it was then I met my " fate." I went with the.
matron into a room in which I saw a soldier lying on his bed, so
very pale I started back, for I thought bp was dead. The noise
of our entrance caused him to turn his head, and} such a pair of
eyes as met my look of compassion I have never seen elsewhere.
There must have been something like magnetic attraction ,in our
eyes, for neither seemed disposed to turn away. I went up to his
bedside, and entered into conversation with him. Soon the
matron said she must leave, as she had to visit other rooms. My'
friends who accompanied me were making the rounds, and I
turned to leave with the matron, when he said, in a low, weak,
tone:

" Please take a chair, and talk to me.. I get so lonely here."
What could I do but comply? My sympathies were enlisted,
and I sat by him for a half hour. In that time he told me he was
a South Carolinian ; had lost a leg in the battles around Richmond;
was fond of reading, but was too weak to read, and the visitors
who came in remained but, a few minutes; had lost his Bible,
which he missed very much. I went into the matron's room, bor-
rowed her Bible, and read a chapter for him. He thanked me,
and, my friends calling for me, I bade him a hearty farewell and
left him, thinking I should never see him again. I came up to
my home. Two weeks later a friend of mine went to Richmond,
and I sent by him to the wounded soldier my Bible-my dead
mother's Bible-with my name written on the fly-leaf. I had no
other small one, and I thought it might. comfort him in his afflic-
tion. tae sent me many thanks, and a message to the effect that
he expected to start home soon, but would not forget his kind
Virginia friend.
More than a month after the Bible was sent, I visited Richmond
again, in company with some friends., We took, the rounds of the
hospitals, and what was my surprise to find Mr. Duval still in his
old room, in bed. He rose on his elbow when he saw, me, and
smiled as I approached him. He told me he had been very ill--
near to death's door. Now, he was once more slowly recovering,
but very feeble. I read for him, and. spent nearly an hour at his
bedside, so very pleasantly it seemed not more than five minutes.
When I bade him farewell, he held out his hand for a more cordial
leave-taking. When I placed my hand in his, he carried it to his
lips, and said I had been a ministering angel to him, and he hoped
we should meet again. I returned home, and in a( few days left
on a visit to some relatives up the country. My health was not
good, and my father agreed for me to prolong my stay, and to
visit the mountains before my return. I was absent more than a
year. When I reached home, I found a letter from Greenville,
South Carolina, from Samuel Duval, in which be stated to me that
he had written to me several. times, and, having failed to hear
from me, was afraid my name had been changed. If such was the
case, he would, like to know it, and to know that I was well and
happy, as he had never ceased to think of me as a dear, kind

friend to him ia strange land. - I was pleased to hear from him,
as the thought that he had forgotten me was not very gladdening
to my vanity. I will not weary- you with details-enough that I-
wrote to him, and the correspondence then begun, has continued
ever since, with only a short interruption, occasioned by the dis-
tracted state of our country after the surrender. For a long while
our letters were such as any friends, might write; and, until the
close of the war, the subject \of love was not discussed between us.
Since that time he has made a formal declaration of his love, and
an offer of his hand. You, with your strict ideas of propriety,
think we ought to know eaci other better before.going so far.
It is true he is a stranger in one sense of the word, but we have
been so long exchanging sentiments and feelings that I feel that I
have known him for years. He has never attempted to deceive
ne; I think I know his pecuniary circumstances; I believe him
to. be the very soul of honor. I received such a kind, fatherly
letter from his father a few days ago. You know that for nearly
two years I have been very lonely, my only parent having been
taken from me. I have never known a mother's love, and he tells
me his mother is very affectionate, and will welcome me with
open arms...
Now, dearest Nellie, I am to be his very soon, about the middle
of January-and I have a proposition to make to you. I have no
sister, and no relative I love as I do you, and I wish you to offi-
ciate as first bridesmaid, and accompany me to my bright Southern
home. Sammie wrote me to secure you asia travelling companion.
I think a winter in the South will bring a few roses into your pale
cheeks. Do not refuse me, dearest friend, as I have set my heart
on having you with me. I have written to Nora to gain your
father's consent. She will be at my marriage, which will take place
at an early hour in the evening, su as to be at the boat in time for
Richmond. Do not fail me.
Yours fondly,        LIZZIE IRBY.
There was not much persuasion required, to gain Ella's con-
sent, and Nora's exquisite taste was displayed in the purchase of
articles necessary for such a journey. Mr. Morrison gave a free
consent, since he hoped his pet would be restored to him in the

spring in the bloom of health. There is something strangely ex-
hilarating and exciting in preparing for a journey, particularly
when we have in contemplation a visit, to a land so balmy and
beautiful as our own bright, sunny South, and Ella's step became
more elastic, and a smile was at times seen to hover around her
mouth. She had less leisure for study or meditation, as she had a
great deal to do before she could leave home for so long a time,
and her father augured well from these signs. If the anticipation
could do so much, what would not the reality accomplish ?
The weeks flew rapidly by, and after taking a tearful farewell
of her father, Ella, accompanied by Nora and her husband, sought
the home of her friend, whom she saw married a few days after;
and bidding farewell to her cousin, who promised to see her
father very often and attend to any little wants of his during her
absence, was borne away to the boat en route for Richmond. She
soon learned to like Mr.. Duval, who was a noble specimen of
Southern chivalry -a genuine courtly Carolinian, and she found
herself tracing out a path of perfect happiness for her friend.
After a short sojourn in Richmond, they left by the Southern
route for Greenville, South Carolina. Everything was new to our
heroine, and as she entered the Palmetto State everything was so
different from what she left behind her. Here she left snow and
ice, leafless trees, and an absence of birds; there she found the'
live oak and magnolia, the orange and palmetto, and the long
gray moss hanging in festoons and swaying gracefully from the
arms of the giant oaks, while the mocking-birds were singing
gayly all the day. 0, who would not give themselves up to the
enjoyment of such beauty? and Ella thought, "What must have
been the glory of this, Eden ere the serpent entered it in the shape
of the devastating Yankee?" They might destroy her cherished
institutions, lay waste her fertile cotton and rice fields, cause the
scourge of fire to pass over hpr beautiful savannas, but her de-
lightful climate they could not change; and ever-provident
Nature, if left alone, would soon recuperate and resume her
wonted glories.

and received many cali  H ad her heart been free it might have
been taken captive by some one of the many fine young men of
that vicinity.
A month passed by (delight fully to all parties, and Mr. DIval
baving some business to transact in Augusta, GIeorgia, asked
Lizzie and Ella to accompany liim, They joyfully accepted the in-
vitation, and spent two pleasant days in Walking about that fine
old city. On the third day, as they were on their way to the de-
not, some horses became frightened and made for the sidewalk,
along which our trio were wending their way. Ella was nearest
the street and would have been trampled under their feet, but for
the timely interposition of a strong arm which drew her forcibly
into a store near at hand. She fainted,,and it was several min-
utes before she recovered.' Mr. Duval knew the young gentleman,
and introduced him to Mrs. Duval and Miss Morrison of Virginia,
as Lieutenant Williams. Ella cast one hurried, frightened glance
at the stranger, and would have fallen but for Mr. Duval, who
eaurht her in his arms. as he exclaimed: "Poor Nelhe, she must
he nurt." Lizzie was weeping, and the kind stranger proposed
that he should call a hack and take her to the hotel. She opened
her eves and said.

held out :er finely shaped hand, which he pressed, as lie .blushed
deeply as any schoolbuy would have done; then turning and

Mri. iuval thanked Lieutenant Wiliams ffor the very grt
service he bid rendered them, and asked him to conme p to reen-
Ville to see themn. He replied that he was on his way to the de-
pot wh en he was so fortunate as to be of service to them, and ex-
pected to be in Greenville that evening  was glad to find they
were going the same way, as he -hoped to become better ac-
qu painted with his lady and her friend.
Mr. )uval called a hack, and all four were -hurried to the de-
pot, which they reached just in time for the train. Lizzie was
very much please with the stranger, and conversed with/ him
freely, feelirig very grateful to him, and winning upon his good
opinion by her anxiety for her silent friend, who had drawn her
veil over her face, and sat watching every expression of a face,
the exact counterpart of the picture she had in her trunk. At
last she closed her eyes, to shut out the black cloud of misery she
,had created for herself. Nothing but the. anxiety of her friends
lest she had received some serious hurt, restored her, in a measure,
to herself. After a while she entered into the conversation atn
exerted herself to please, since she saw her kind friends wished it,
and succeeded beyond her expectations,
That evening Lieutenant Williams took tea with them, and,
as he had business in the country near town, remained two weeks,
spending every evening with them, until Ella looked for his com-
ing with a heightened color and nervousness which her friends
noted and commented on. He and Ella had walked out together
nearly-every evening or ridden on horseback in the eariy morn.
had visited every spot of natural beauty in ten miles of Green-
vile, and were becoming desperately in love with each other. It
was on the last evening of his stay that' Mr. Duval invited ithe
young people of the town to meet at his house, in honor of his
two young friends, Robert and Ella. Lizzie insisted that Ela
should wear white, and when she came down stairs for her friend's
inspection, before the guests assembled, she did not see Robert,
who had come in early, hoping to have her company awhile all to
himself, Lizzie exclaimed :
"Nellie, you are really beautiful to-night : more so, if possible.
than you were at Nora Stanhope's wedding. and I thought you
perfect then."

less attention to his description of the letters she had written, and
felt pleased at his praises ; how he had learned to love one whom
he had never seen, and would have been willing to make her his
bride, so well satisfied was he as to her purity and truthfulness
but had hesitated to declare his love until he was able to visit her
how he had been (hocked and disappointed when in answer to
his last letter, he received an  invitation to her marriage.
'Ella hesitated, but it was for a short time only. It was her
duty to clear her cousin fromall suspicions. She had been the
culprit, and Nora must not he blamed. At length she turned her
eye full upon his face, and she asked, almost inaudibly:
" If I were to tell you that another had used my cousin's
name, and that she had never written a line to you, would you
believe me?"
"Yes, if you were to tell me you knew the fact, I could not
doubt your word."
"Could you," she continued " love her who had deceived you,

strong arm around her and asked':
"Ella, my sweet friend, am I correct in hoping that lady was
yourself?
She dropped herlead to hide her confusion as she murmured:
You do not hate her then ? "
Hate her ? No ; but would love her with all my heart if she
would permit me. Will you, Nellie ? "
She smiled through her tears as she asked :
"You really forgive me ?"
" Yes, upon one condition, which is, since you dislike. your
name so much, youv-will consent to change it once more, and that,
very soon."
I suppose her consent was gained, as they appeared very
happy when they entered the house.
Lizzie, who was indignant at the aspersions cast upon her
friend's character, had to have the whole story told her, and was
delighted at the thought of having Ella near her. In beautiful,
balmy April, when the magnolias were in bloom, Lieutenant
Williams escorted Ella to her home, her health fully restored,
and a happy light in her eye, which did her father's heart good.
When the autumn came there was a quiet wedding, and followed
by many tears and blessings, Ella left her childhood's home for
the home of her husband on the banks of the beautiful Savannah.
This time her father could not stay behind. He sold his property
in Virginia, and went to make his home with his only child.
Now we will bid the reader farewell, with the hope that our
little story may serve to amuse him or her for a short while in
these times of general gloom. Adieu!

Alice Chester had been married five years. The world looked
on and wondered when Charles Chester, the proud, man of the
world, who had withstood the fascinations of so many city belles,
until at the age of thirty-five he married the simple country maiden
of twenty, and took her to preside over his city home. But the
Mrs. Grundys were disappointed if they expected to find what
they termed "rustic simplicity.". Her natural love of the beau-
tiful had been cultivated and trained in a proper direction. Her
father's plain farm-house had been visited by none but the refined
and the excellent of her vicinity.
Charles Chester had met her at the residence of a country
friend, and been won by her modesty and good sense; and after
six months of devotion, such as she had read of in novels, he in-
duced her to leave her wildwood bower for one of more artistic
excellence in the city. She was passionately fond of books, music
and flowers; and many rare volumes of poetry, which she had
longed for without having the means of obtaining them, were fur-
nished by her lover, and bright pictures were drawn of the beau-
tiful home he had for her. With her poet's love of the beautiful,
and the elegances of refined society, which was to be gratified by
a union with the really fine-looking and seemingly appreciative
man before her, how could she reject him? He was the hero of
her romantic fancy, and, she loved him with all the ardor and
purity of her nature.
She was happy in her new home - happier far than she had
thought it possible for her to be. True, she was disappointed in
the society around her. All who visited her were men and women
of fashion -gay, giddy, and altogether uncongenial; their only
topics of conversation were the amusements and trifling on dits of

the season. Still she had her books and music, and her husband's
society every evening. She was a stranger in the city, and made
few calls, for the reason that he never went with her, and she did
not like to depend on strangers for those acts of politeness which
she had a right to expect from her husband ; consequently she
was called unsocial. She wondered why he who ws apparently
fond of her music and conversation, should not prefer to have in-
tellectual friends'to visit him. He never offered to take her to a
lecture or any literary or musical treat in town, and when she
ventured to say she would like .to hear a popular lecturer who
was stopping in their city, he spoke rather shortly, she thought,
and said that was the way with women, they were never satisfied
with what they had. She did not insist, but the first tears of dis-
appointment were shed during the still hours of that night. 11cr
housekeeping was never neglected. She had good servants, but
her mother had taught her that a lady should rule her own-house
and see that things were kept in order, and her husband could
find no fault with her in that particular. A very few months
served to show her that she was mistaken in her estimate of her
husband's character. Naturally tyrannical, he soon began to show'
symptoms of a desire to be master of her actions and desires. He
wearied of feigng a devotion he did not feel, and thought she
bad no right to complain when her wants were supplied. Her de-
votion did not abate. She took an interest in his business, to'
please him, and did everything in her power to make home
pleasant and cheerful. He told her women knew nothing of busi-
ness, and he did not like to be questioned. If she read the po-
litical papers and tried to interest him thus, he did not like to see
women meddling with politics; thus rudely severing every' link
which bound them together.'
Before her marriage she had been engaged in writing for a
literary journal; now in her isolation she resorted to that prolific
field for enjoyment. Her contributions became more frequent,
and of such a character as to attract the attention of the press.
She received a letter from her publisher, requesting her to write'
exclusively and constantly for his journal for'a stipulated amount.
She showed the letter to her husband, who angrily forbade her
making any such engagement. "I have submitted to this thing

THE WIFE'S TEMPTA TION.

because I thought you wanted some amusement, but the moment
you begin to receive remuneration for your writing you must
support yourself independent of me." Her eyes were often
heavy with the weight of unshed tears, but she forced them back
and tried to be cheerful and to seem contented with her lot. In
her few visits to her parents she let no word escape her to lead
them to believe she was unhappy. I believe that tyranny grows
upon what it feeds on, and that tyrants are ever cowardly.
Twelve months after her marriage, and the very morning after
Alice's reception of that' letter from her publisher, several gentle-
men were sitting in Mr. Chester's counting-room, when Arthur
Morton, a young friend of Mr. Chester's, took from his pocket a
magazine and said: "I would give much to know the author of
this article by 'Alice.' I have read her sketches and essays for the
past two years, and never saw anything better from the pen of a
woman. Have you read any of them, Charlie? This last one is
excellent." Mr. Chester spoke very shortly, "I never read any-
thing written by a woman." A man present, who had been a fre-
quent visitor at Mr. Chester's, spoke up: "Why, Morton, they
tell me Mrs. Chester is the author of those sketches. Her name
is Alice. No one would ever suppose that she was a writer, she
is so quiet and retiring in her manners. I. have always thought
literary women were either fast or blue, but Charlie's little lady-
bird has changed my opinion." Mr. Morton was deservedly noted
for his literary talents, and was no mean critic. Mr. Chester
knew that well enough, but he had that mean, selfish disposition
which does not like for any one to admire what -is underrated by
itself,'and he was almost ready to crush his former friend, when
he laid his hand on his arm and said: " Why, Charlie, you cer-
tainly have not kept the fact that your wife was 'a lady of such
talents from your friend who is always ready to fall down and
worship genius ? You ought to be proud of her, man. Strange
that you have never asked me to call on you since your marriage.
I have never seen your wife. Really, Charlie, if she were mine,
I should consider myself rich in the possession of such a treasure.
Shall I ask myself to call on you this evening?"  It was with
difficulty that Mr. Chester could preserve his usual politeness,
but he did so, and replied, "Certainly, Arthur, come by the store

and I will go with you to my residence." When he went to
dinner that day he ordered his wife to discontinue her contribu-
tions to the press. " My dear husband," she pleaded, "I do not
neglect any duty for my writing. It is such a comfort to me dur-
ing your absence at the -store, and I have so much time unem-
ployed otherwise." "I will not have my wife known as a literary
woman. Had you heard the conversation in my store to-day
relative to that very article you were-working on last week, you
would not feel so much like writing such nonsense. Arthur
Morton criticised- it severely, and George. Carter said in my
presence that all literary women were fast, and he knew all the
time that you wrote it, for I heard him telling Morton so," Her
face flushed as she-arose from the table and laid her hand on his
slh ulder.  Her voice was hoarse with emotion as she said,
" Charlie, you used to praise my talents. You have told me that
you were first attracted to me by my modesty, then held bound
by that and my good, sense. Those were your words, my hus-
band. Then why did you not contradict that libel on my class?
I am not fast, and I am a literary woman. Discontinuing my
contributions to the press will not change my nature, neither will
it prevent my name being known as a writer if it  s already,
talked about. It was very rude in George Carter toy say that
even if it had been true, when he knew your wife was a literary
woman. He must not come here any more. .I do not wish to
associate with men so wanting in common politeness. I had
thought better of Mr. Carter than that. As regards Mr. Morton's
criticisms, I expect to be criticised, and I do not think my style
free from faults."  He arose from the table, pushed her from him
and said : "It is useless to argue the question farther. I will not
have my wife known as a literary character. As regards George
Carter's visits to my house, he will take tea with us to-night in,
company with Arthur Morton, and you, must ,not only receive
them, but treat Carter as you have always done." " I can't do it,,
Mr. Chester. I have some pride. You are too proud to have
your wife .kno wn as a literary woman. I am proud'enough to,
resent an insult when my husband fails in his duty." There was
a stern determination in her eyes and compressed lips that he had
never seen there before. He was awed for a moment, but the brute

soon overpowered the man, and he said coarsely: "You can be
as tragic as you please, madam, but if George Carter is treated
with any rudeness to-night, you will be turned out into the street
before morning. I shall be master of my own house." He called
the cook and gave orders that supper should be ready by eight
o'clock and everything should be 'nice. Alice hurried off to her
chamber, too angry to weep or to think what she should do. It
was the first time she had dared to speak for herself. The more
she had yielded the more tyrannical he had become. George
Carter had been the most pleasant, because the most -sensible of
the gentlemen visitors at her house, and she had liked his com-
pany very well. Now, what should she do? Must she submit'to
insult from others as well as tyranny from her husband ? She
turned her head. There lay her portfolio with the fruits of many.
pleasant hours that she must resign, and for what ? Just to please
him. Had not her pleasures been curtailed until she had scarcely
anything left ? Should she yield ? Was it her duty ?, There was
her Bible, her mother's gift. She opened it instinctively and read:
"Wives, obey your husbands, as, Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling
him lord." She laid it down and fell on her knees. After an
hour of self-communion and prayer for guidance she went about
her duties. Her writing materials were stowed away and locked
up. After going to the parlor and dining-room and seeing that
everything was in order, she returned to dress for tea. The old
rebellion tried to master her. " I will not see him. Let him turn
me out. I can make my own living. My parents' arms are open
to receive me. They never wounded me thus." Then her duty.
Was it not plainly written in her Bible? She brushed out her
beautiful auburn hair, and put it back in shining, waving bands,
with a single Cape jasmine on one side of her finely formed
head. She took out her dresses and selected one which her hus-
band had particularly admired, a delicate blue organda muslin,
and having arrayed herself with exquisite taste, she surveyed her-
self in a large mirror and found nothing to complain of in her
tout ensemnle. There was a mist in her large hazel eyes and a flush
on her cheek which but enhanced her beauty as her visitors were
ushered into her presence. There was a lifting of the frown from
her husband's brow and a faint smile which did not escape her

notice, as she responded to Mr. Carter's cordial salutation with a
rather stately, though polite, " Good evening, Mr. Carter."  Mr.
Morton was perfectly fascinated by the vision of beauty and
modest intelligence, and soon became a fixture by Alice's side.
Mr. Carter's advances were met with a polite reserve which was
puzzling to him, since he had become a familiar guest. The half
hour preceding supper was spent in general conversation ; Alice
surpassed herself. 'At supper she presided with grace and dignity.
At the conclusion of the meal Mr. Morton offered his arm to con.-
dpct her to the parlor as he said, " I dare say Mr. Chester told
y)u of our conversation at his store this morning?" " Yes, sir,
he did." She flushed at the remembrance of the dinner hour, and
her hand trembled visibly on his arm. ie was silent a moment, then
as he seated himself on the-sofa beside her, he continued: " I did
not know that you ever wrote for the press until this morning.
I have seen your articles for the past two years and admired them
more than I can tell you, but did inot know the author was the
wife of my old friend Charlie Chester, until George Carter .told
me so this morning. Do you know, Mrs. Chester, that you
have disabused George's mind of a very erroneous opinion he once
entertained of the literati? "  She turned her large eyes full upon
his face and said eagerly : "I disabused his mind ? Did he not
say this very morning that all literary women were fast? Oh,
Mr. Morton, you can never know what an effort it has cost me to
meet him politely. I did not care for your poor opinion of my
writings as I did for any one's bad opinion of my reputation as a
lady. You 'had a right to criticise my writings, they are public
property, but he had no right to say it, and Mr. Chester should not
have --" she stopped short. " Pardon me, my indignation has,
led me too. far." "Mrs. Chester, my dear madam, you were cer.
tainly misinformed, through what motive I cannot divine. I will
tell you what was said by both. of us," and he related the conver-
sation of the morning. She listened eagerly, then clasping her,
hands, she said, " Thank God, I am undeceived. I do not like to
think harshly of any one. I must not let Mr. Carter think I am
angry with him without a cause."  She did not tell him anything
to cause him to think less of her husband. Mr. Chester and his
friend came in from the porch where they had been enjoying ,

their cigars, and when Mr. Carter came forward and asked for
music, she arose quickly and smilingly seated herself at the piano.
She sang song after song, until her listeners felt as though they
were floating off "on the waves of her sweet singing." Even
her husband was smilingly kind and affectionate in his manner
toward her. She was conscious of looking remarkably well, and
now her spirits rose above the troubles of the afternoon, and she
knew that she was doing well, appearing to the best advantage.
The night passed off happily; the morrow brought a black cloud.
Jealousy, the green-eyed monster, was lurking beneath that pleas-
ait exterior of the night before. When Alice bade her lord a
pleasant " good morning," he frowned on her and said: "So your
opposition to my asking Mr. Carter to my house was all feigned,
was it ? You looked a little stately at first, it is true, but your
very great amiability toward the close of the evening was plain
enough to my mind that the first was only acting to deceive me."
She drew back from the hand he had laid on her shoulder. "Mr.
Chester, you know that you do me injustice. Why did you ask
Mr. Carter to your house and command me to receive him cor-
dially or be thrust into the street ? Those were your words. I
did not fear being thrust into the street, for I know I can support
myself by my literary labors; but my Bible tells me to obey my
husband, and I have tried to do so, at what a sacrifice of feeling
you can never know. I have never knowingly disobeyed you in
anything. The story you told me of Mr. Carter's opinion of me
was manufactured for the occasion. Believe me, sir, I should
.have remained coldly polite to him had not Mr. Morton repeated
the conversation in your store more truthfully, I believe, than
you did, thereby exonerating Mr. Carter. Thrust me into the
street if you will, I have borne enough. I will not bear jealousy
added to my other wrong," and she left the 'room. She did not
see him again that day. When he came home the next evening
his eyes were red and every lineament of his face showed dissipa-
tion. She had been suspecting him 'of drinking and gambling,
but until then he had never been so very drunk in her presence.
He seemed to have forgotten the abuse of the day before, and she
ministered to him as best she could, shedding scalding drops of
tears in secret. When he got sober she remonstrated with him,

begging him for the sake of this good name to desist. He seemed
penitent and promised reformation ; told her he had been drink-
ing a long time, that'was what made him so- cross, but she was
the angel to reform him.
Six months passed away, six months of bitter trial to the
young wife.  Dissipation had taken fast hold upon Charles
Chester. He lost large sums at cards, until his store was closed,
his house and furniture sold, and he left penniless. Then she
proved an angel indeed. She went with him to a distant State,
where he tried spasmodically to reform and to get into business.
Two years of such privations and'hardships as she never thought
she could perform she had to endure, and every cent she made by
her needle, if not spent as soon- as earned in provisions, went for
intoxicating drinks, until Charles Chester became as low as a man'
can well become. His patient wife had long ago lost all respect
for him; nothing but a sense of duty kept her with him -the hope
that she might win him from his wickedness. She who might
have been the pride of a literary circle wasthe debased wife of a
low drunkard, forced to the most menial toil for subsistence, and
subject to the worst kind of abuse from him who should have
been her protector. He forbade her writing to her friends, so
that all hope of help from them was cut off. At length he was illy
very ill, and the fear of death caused him to permit her to write
to her father.. She did so, -and hesent her means to take them to
his house. She had begged him to permit her to send some ar-
ticle to a newspaper which was paying for literary contributions,
but he persistently refused. When they were ready. to start
home she made up a roll of literary articles and went out osten-
sibly to purchase a pair of shoes, telling him she had a little
money she had made by sewing while he was sick, but she wended
her way to a newspaper office, and showed her articles together
with some letters she had received from the editor of the ---
Magazine. The editor was a polite, kind man, and told her to call;
again in two hours. She did so, and received ten dollars for the
articles, with which she purchased a few articles of clothing and
a travelling bonnet. He was in too much of a hurry to fly from
death, as he thought, to be angry when she told him the truth.
In a week they were at her father's house. How different in

appearance and in feelings ! Her parents received them kindly--
their daughter oh how gladly, and her husband kindly for her
sake. Three years and a half of married life and not .one year of
true happiness ! Now that she was at home, shielded by a moth-
er's love, the long strain upon her nervous system brought on a
low wasting fever, and for months she was but a shadow of her
former self. Her husband, whose energies were dead, insisted
now on her writing for money to support themselves, but she was
unequal to the task, and for twelve months she felt that she could
never write again. Her brain seemed paralysed. When she re-
covered so as to be able to go out, and feel sufficient strength of
mind and body, she undertook to teach a few pupils at her
father's residence, and succeeded in 'making a small sum, which
her husband took and went off with upon the plea that he was
looking for business. She had given him clothing sufficient to
last him two years. He remained four months, and returned
without a cent of money, and no clothing but what he had on.
Her friends urged a separation, as he came home drinking, with
every sign of having been on a spree all the time of his absence.
" Until death us do part," she repeated. Sometimes her strength
almost failed her, and she shuddered as lie came into her presence.
When he taunted her with not loving him, she felt that he spoke
the truth, but she dare not say so, She only replied, " Love be-
gets love." He was cross and disagreeable in her father's family.
.She saw that they bore it only for her sake, and the fact made her
miserable. She would have left with him, much as she loved her
parents and feared her husband, so firm was her belief that she
was doing her duty. Six months passed in her little school. To
relieve the pressure of disagreeable thoughts upon her brain, she
resorted to her pen once more. This time the ideas came without
much effort,-and she found that practice made them flow faster.
0, the pleasure of thislong-forbidden occupation ! She .wrote to'
offer her contributions to the Magazine again, but received an
answer that they could not engage any more writers at present,
their list was full. They had neve/- forgiven her for withdrawing
from them four years previousl . There was.a new literary paper
started in her native State; to that she wrote, and sent a specimen
article. It was accepted; she wrote regularly for a few months,

when she received a letter during her husband's absence froi
Arthur Morton, whot was literary editor of the paper, telling her
that he would pass through the country in a week or so and
would call on her. le was an -old friend of her husband, some
five years younger perhaps, still his friend, and as such she felt
no hesitancy in .inviting him to call, She did not know until lie
nVotc that he was connected with the paper. She had poured
out her whole soul in her poems and stories, and her peculiar sor-
rows were depicted in those of her heroines; She was thinner,
and there were a few lines of care plainly visible in her face, still
she had the same sweetsmile and low gentle voice, the same
childlike simplicity and earnestness of manner.  When Mr.
Morton came he held her hand as he looked into her. face and
said, " The same, a little older, a little more .careworn, still the,
same true woman. " Her husband was present at the meeting,
and a glance at himn showed his brow to darken and his lips to
compress. She withdrew her hand as she said, " I ani always the
same to my husband's $friends and mine, Mr. lorton."  She had
not seen him since that memorable evening on which he was pre-
.sented to her. . As her husband's friend she had received him
kindly, and had been very favorably impressed by his noble bear-
ing and true gentlemanly deportment, as by the beauty and deli-
cacy of his sentiments. It was a treat, ",a feast of reason and a
flow of soul" which she had never forgotten; and that one friend
of an evening was often thought of, and those few short hours
looked back upon as the one oasis in her desert life. Her pleasure
at his coming now, after four years of silence, was great, though
mixed with dread of her husband's strange jealous temper. He
judged every person's motives by his own, and did not believe it
possible for two persons of the opposite sexes to enjoy each
pther's society, or exchange sentiments upon intellectual subjects
.lone. His wife was watched and guygled as though he expected
every man who saw her to wish to rob him of her. It is said that
jealousy cannot exist without love. That may be true, but save
me, 0 fate, from such love! Charles Chester could not begin to
understand or to value the pure spirit of his wife. How she could*
have loved him and how she longed to do so, to commune with
him as her equal, as a twin-born soul, he could not know. His.

spirit was too coarse, too sensual for communion with hers. O,
is it a sin to break such bands? 'fo sever those whom God has
never joined together ? But I roust not stop to moralise. -fTwo
days Mr. Chester seemed to share his wife's pleasure at the com-
ing of his friend. Only she knew better, she only knew of the
low, brutal taunts and threats when alone with him in her chan-
her. She tried to prevent their disagreeients from being known,
and to act as, though she were free in the presence of their guest.
On the third morning, after the most shameless abuse, such as
brought the crimson flush of shame to her delicate cheek, he left.
saying he would never live with her again. She might go with
Morton and welcome. She pled and remonstrated with him.
He told her he had been tired of her a long time, and only stayed
with her to spite her. When he had gone, she ran out to a bower
formed of grape-vines, out of hearing and out of sight of the
house, and throwing herself on the grass with her head on the
rustic seat, gave vent to her anguish in groans and tears. "o,
my God, must I bear it longer?" was the expression of her heart
and lips. She could not tell her parents, they grieved enough for
her at best. Where should she turn for comfort ? The God whom
she had tried to serve seemed to have forsaken her. She tried to
pray, but her faith was well-nigh dead ; for five years she had
prayed, without any sign that her prayers were heard. Just then
an arm was thrown around her, and her head raised from its
lowly position. She looked up quickly, and beheld Arthur Mor-
ton's eyes fixed upon her with such tender compassion. Her
strength failed her, and her head dropped for a moment on his
arm, and she sobbed in all the abandon of grief. He drew her
nearer to him and spoke in a low tone, Alice, dear Alice, tell me
what it is." She drew herself up from his arm and stood before
him. "Mr. Morton," she said. "you have no right to address me
in such language. Remember, sir, I am the wife of your friend.
He drew back sadly and}leaned against the framework, with his
fine eyes bent sadly on her. face as he said, " Mrs. Chester. you
scorn my sympathy because you think I do not know the cause
of your sorrow, I have known it for years, more than you ever
supposed any one knew. Think you I coui not read it in your

spirit -is too pure for such companionship ; you are, purity and

vou to him. Seek redress and freedom at law, sever the cursed
bond that makes you his slave."
She tottered and fell on the rustic seat behind her: her face'
was very pale, and there was a wistful look in her sad dark eyes
as she raised them to his face and tried to speak. He knelt before
her, and clasped her hand as he pleaded with her to save herself
from farther degradation. " Your parents desire it, you know;
you have a sweet hine here if the trail of the serpent were not
over it all. 0, Alice, banish that serpent forever." A gleam- of
hope played for a moment over her sad features, then a cold
shiver ran through her frame as she withdrew her hand from his
clasp, and murmured almost inaudibly, "I cannot. 0, Mr. Mor-
ton, pity me, but do not tempt me farther. 'Until death us do
part,' was the vow I made at the altar five years ago; do not
seek to change me. My duty ! Omy duty ! If I could think as
you and my friends generally do that I had done more than my
duty, I. might be happy yet; I might listen to your pleadings,
dear friend, but I cannot. My vow was registered in heaven; I
am his until death sets me free. Thank God, there is a future life-
where friends may meet without reproach; until then farewell;
we must not meet again." He tried to detain her, but she glided

past him and tried to reach the house ; she took but a, few steps
before she fainted and fell; he raised her tenderly in his arms,
kissed her colorless cheek once, twice, then bore her to her
mother, in whose care he left her, and was soon wending his way
to the station
When she recovered, her eyes wandered as if in search of some
one. Her mother told her Mr. Morton had found her insensible
in the grape arbor and had brought her in. She closed her eyes
and lay so quietly her mother thought she was sleeping. 0, the
agony of that quiet communion .with her own heart. Here was
love and happiness offered her, appreciation and sympathy; she
must turn from it all - for what? Ah ! the future would have
to reveal the reason for all this suffering.
Two months later Alice received a letter from a stranger in a
distant State, saying her husband was very ill and desired her to
go to him at once.. She did not hesitate a moment, but was soon
on her way, she knew not to what further degradation -and suf-
fering. When she reached her point of destination she found her
husband very ill, apparently in a hopeless condition. She was
repaid for her sacrifice and her triumph over her great temp-
tation, when in his delirium he called her name, with every en-
dearing epithet which was so sweet to her in the first months of
their wedded life. Then he would mourn in agony and cry, "My
poor injured darling, she must hate nie, she will never come.''
We will pass over the days of delirium and danger. Enough
that he did not die. There is nothing like sickness or sorrow to
call forth all the latent energy and love of a woman's nature.
With returning health Mr. Chester showed conclusively that he
was a changed man. For months he was unable to attend to any
business. When he recovered sufficiently they returned to her
childhood's home, where he attended to the old farm and became
a sober, good citizen, and a Christian and a most devoted hus-
band to her whom he called his good genius.
Did she ever recall the hours of darkness she had passed
through ? Perhaps she did, but it was only to be grateful that
she did not listen to the promptings of her own heart, or advice
of well-meaning but mistaken friends. She heard Arthur Mor-
ton's name without regret, and prayed that he might be as happy
as she was.

was particularly anxious to get into his church. He was very
fond of Mr. Wilson's society and visitedjhin very frequently, ever
finding his conversation both pleasant and instructive. He had
well-nigh decided to renounce the pomups and vanities of this
wicked world and unite with the JBev. Mr. Wilson's church.
While thus pleasantly engaged, a man well known ine the vil-
lage and its vicinity as a rough, dissolute character, living in
abject poverty and steeped in vice, walked up and inquired for
the Rev. Mr. Wilson. The reverend gentleman replied, "I am
Mr. Wilson, what do you want ?" He replied, " My wife is very
ill ; Dr. Brown says she can't live twenty-four hours. She heard
you preach once, and is very anxious fdr you to go and pray with
her before she dies. She is in great distress, sir, and I wish you
would go at once."
The poor man seemed deeply distressed, but he was a great
sinner, and the propriety of going in to such a neighborhood must
be considered. The minister answered coldly, "I will see what I
can do for you."
The disconsolate hovel to which he was invited was five miles
distant, and in a neighborhood noted for its depravity. The Rev.
Mr. Wilson had. a pleasant riding buggy and a valuable horse,
and therefore could not excuse himself upon the plea that he had
not the facilities for reaching the poor man's home.
What must he do? This was the question which presented
itself. Every instinct of his nature shrank from  such low
associations, even for one hour. He consulted his wife. She
urged him to go, and go quickly. He consented, provided brother
Jones, an old and influential member of the church, would con-
sent to accompany hinm.
Brother Jones, it was ascertained, was from home, and would
not return before nightfall. Brother Smith doubted the propriety
of " mixing up " with such people. A visit to such a place
might injure his usefulness, and excite remarks which might ren-
der him less acceptable among his own circle. That was suf-
cient to deter him from moving another step in a work of mercy.
"It will not pay," was his comment as he returned home to
inform the man that he could not go. His refusal was not
smoothed in the least. An apology for not going with such a

WILL    IT PAY?
A MINISTER'S MISTAKE.
Mr. Wilson was decidedly 'the most popular minister with
which the church at Unionsville had ever been blessed. He
preached good sound gospel sermons, and his hearers' . hearts
were stirred by the earnest love and charity which ran through
all his words. He was niuch liked by all denominations, and by
sinners as well as saints. The church flourished, the congrega-
tions were larger, and the finances in a much better condition
than at any previous period of its history.
The parsonage was in a wealthy and fashionable neighbor-
hood, and the minister's family were invited out to ,dinner and
to tea, while he was the life of every social gathering. Truly a
minister so highly honored and universally petted must be sans
reproche.
Let us go to his home and see the motive-power of his actions.
A lovely place was that village parsonage. Nature and art vied
with each other in making it a worthy abode for God's chosen
ministers - a place suggestive of- pure thoughts and lofty aspira-
tions.
Let us visit it in beautiful May, when the air is burthened
with the perfume of many lovely flowers, and the free and happy
songsters are caroling their songs of praise from the boughs of
noble trees, and in and around all seems peaceful and pure.
It was a balmy afternoon. A sumptuous dinner had been
partaken of, and the family, together with a young friend, were
seated on the piazza, engaged in pleasant converse. That young
friend was Robert Armistead, an intelligent and wealthy young
law-student, who had halted between two opinions for some time,
almost persuaded to become a.Christian, and whom Mr. Wilson

man would be out of place. 0  spirit of the meek and lowly
Jesus, where dwellest thou ?
The Rev. Mr. Wilson saw the look of deep anxiety and
wretchedness in the man's fice change to one of deadly hate and
rebellion as he turned off, but he heeded it not. Was not he
above his anger, secure in the confidence of his people?
Mrs, Wilson implored him to go, and offered to accompany
him. He still refused, and gave- as a reason that the general good,
of the church required himi to be very circumspect. There were
evil-minded persons always watching a minister, and endeavoring
to bring some charge against him, which would damage his power
for good and bring reproach upon the church. This reasoning
might be very conclusive to his mind, but his wife reasoned from
her instinctive feeling for distressed humanity, and with tears
coursing down her cheeks, plead:
"0, my husband, did our blessed Saviour hesitate to do good
because his subjects were poor and vile ? Did he shrink from the
touch of Mary Magdalene, though he had.to cast out seven devils
which possessed her? Do you not remember that, when rebuked
for eating with publicans and sinners, he replied: 'I came not
to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance'? and do we not
read that 'there is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth'?
It does not read a rich and influential person, but a sinner. How
can you hesitate? Even while I am pleading, a poor creature is
dying and begging for the prayers of one of'God's ministers."
Tears nor prayers could move him. Though he felt and
knew it was his duty, yet "Will it pay ?" interposed and made
him still refuse. While he might go and be instrumental in
saving that poor woman's soul by so' doing, a dozen others mi ht
be lost to his church. He thought it his duty to consider how he
might accomplish the greatest amount of good and get the
greatest number of members into the church.
My readers may. think the picture overdrawn. Some say:
" There never was such a case. No minister would .refuse to
visit a dying person under any circumstances." Ah, reader, I
thought so too, until cruelly undeceived by one in whose piety
and self-denial I had perfect confidence.
But we will proceed with the story. The young friend who

was visiting the minister witnessed the whole scene, and listened
to the importunities of the wife with pale face, as if his future
peace depended on the result, until indignation forced him to
seize his hat and leave very abruptly. He walked rapidly down
the street to a house where a young minister, who had lately
come among them as pastor of a new church, boarded with one
of his churchmen. He knocked at~ the door, and asked for Mr.
Allen, the minister. Mr. Allen was a quiet,-rather retiring young
man, extremely modest, and not calculated to become very popular
among people who admired fine social qualities, or. rhetorical
flourishes in a minister.
He came out and politely asked Mr. Armistead to walk in.
Mr. A. quickly informed him that a man had just left the village
who was anxious to get a minister to visit and pray. with his
dying wife. Mr. Allen asked :
"Where is the place, and how far must I go ? "
"Five miles, and among the lowest class of persons in the
State. Not many persons are willing to go to the neighborhood,
though I thought I ought to tell you, as the man seemed so
anxious,"
"Not willing to go ?" was Mr. Allen's interruption. "My
friend, can you think any place too low for a minister of the
Gospel of Christ, or any person to visit on a mission of mercy ?
Is not one immortal soul worth saving ? Not go ? I should be
afraid to refuse to answer so manifest a call of duty. Excuse me
a moment while I make a few necessary preparations. I have no
horse and must walk, but that makes no difference, except that I
may not be able to get there in time."
A smile lighted up Mr. Armistead's face as he asked, " You
surely would not walk five miles to visit an outcast from
society ?
"Certainly, sir, I would walk twice five miles to save an im-
mortal soul."
" Wait a moment, Mr. Allen ; I have a good horse and buggy,
and will drive you there in a half hour, if you will accept the aid
and society of an unregenerate man." Mr. Allen turned back
and grasped his hand as he thanked him, and prayed silently that
good might be accomplished by this visit.

Our friends reached the hovel before the husband did, and
when he got home, burning with indignation and resentment to-
ward all who called themselves Christians, he was surprised to
hear the voice of prayer in the house. He entered and found Mr.
Allen kneeling by the side of. the bed, praying that the sick
woman might have assurance that her sins were pardoned before
she died. Near him knelt Robert Armistead-one the world called
noble and delighted to honor, with tears falling over his clasped
hands. Bitter as were his feelings when he reached home, the
scene melted him to tears ; and when the minister arose from his
knees, he was sitting upon the side of the bed holding a hand of
his dying wife and weeping bitterly.  Several neighbors, as
rough as he had ever been, hald gathered in and around the house,
and were paying reverent attention to all the minister said. The'
scene was so pure and sacred,.methinks the angels were leaning
from Heaven and looking on with delight, ready to catch the tear
of penitence and the first breath of saving faith, and bear them
to the throne of the All-Father, that the door might be opened
to admit the soul of the dying woman.
The poor wife died, leaving the assurance that her sins were
pardoned and the sting of death removed. The minister was re-
quested to return on the morrow and read the burial service of
his church. He complied with the request, and spoke words of
comfort to the bereaved friends. When he left he was requested
by several of the neighbors to' come and preach for them some-
times. His visit was appreciated, and opened new wells in the
hearts of that neglected and hardened class, proving that there is
some good in all, and that there are few, if any, cases of total
depravity.
A few weeks later Robert Armistead united with Mr. Allen's
church. Mr. Wilson did his best to induce him to continue his
visits to, his house and his attendance at his church, but he had
been so shocked by the want of Christian 'spirit which he dis-
played. he shuddered to think of the probable.consequences had
Mr. Allen been of the same spirit. All faith in religion might
have been destroyed, and his brilliant mind left a prey to doubts
and skepticism as long as he lived.
As it was. his influence was exerted for good, and a noble and

useful Christian he proved. His genuine piety and unpretending
goodness had their effect. He preached frequently for those
people whom others shunned, and was rewarded by their rapid
improvement. In a year there was a neat chapel built in their
midst, and the passer-by, who formerly heard oaths and rude
jests, now heard the songs of Zion and saw an orderly and neat
community. The husband of that dying woman was among the
first whounited with the church, and Mr. Allen had the pleasure
of baptizing him and his two infant children into the church on
the same day.
What of Mr. Wilson, the once popular preacher ? Not many
months served to prove to him his sad mistake. While trying to
steer his course so as to offend none, he forgot the precepts of his
Divine Master, and had his reward in the very perceptible dimin-
ution of his congregations, and the non-approvalsof those whose
favor lie courted,
Very uncertain are the smiles and approval of this world,
Those of whose friendship we feel most secure are sometimes our
most/formidable foes. Mr. Armistead's union with a church he
was'laboring to pull down affected Mr. Wilson's popularity more
than anything else; for, strange inconsistency ! " Brother Smith "
was the first to taunt him with being a man-pleaser and com-
plain of the disaffection in the church. Instead of gaining a
dozen accessions to his church, he lost a score or more beside the
confidence of his brethren.' Before the year closed he had be-
come so unpopular that he was glad to leave for a distant field of
labor, where it is to be hoped that he has found it will pay to do
one's duty under all circumstances, regardless of the probability
or even the certainty of what the worst persons can say of him.
If it will pay even in this world, then how much more in the
world to come!

An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told."-hakspeard.
When Alexander the Great led his host of brutal soldiery into
the hearts of the most beautiful countries on the globe, laying
waste fertile fields and quiet hamlets,. destroying populous cities,
and turning thousands of widows and orphans out from shelter
and hope, he was called a hero. Napoleon Bonaparte, fired by
an unholy ambition-not satisfied with rising from obscurity to the
head of the French nation, made war upon happy and inoffensive
countries, by brute force added .kingdom after kingdom to his
vast dominions, until the whole civilised world trembled at the
sound of his name. For this he was called a hero.
Joan of Arc, with a mad fanaticism, clothed in a full suit 'of
armor. with the sword of the conqueror waving over her head,
led a superstitious army to conquest. She was called a heroine.
Florence Nightingale, braving fatigue, danger, even death in
the hospitals of the Crimea, was a far nobler woman than Joan
of Arc, and deserves the love and veneration of' all true men and
women: but, nobler, greater is the heroism which, regardless of
the jeers and slanders of a censorious world, can bravely pursue
the path of duty marked out for him or her by Providence. I can
better illustrate my meaning by a story, which can soon be told.
Nettie Arnold was the pride of a large circle of friends, the
only daughter of' a man of unbounded ambition, and veneration
for learning. Her mind, naturally fine, had been thoroughly
trained, until she had few equals in education. Add to this a
manner unaffectedly kind and polished; a heart endowed with the
most generous impulses, a prepossessing appearance, and a repu-
tation above reproach, and we need .not wonder that she was
admired and respected by all who knew her.  Zany wondered
that she remained single ; with that we have nothing to do.' The
years glided by, robbing her of none of her charms.

I said she was an only daughter. True, she was the only child
of her mother, but her father had married the second time when
Nettle was a wee, delicate child. Her stepmother, a noble speci-
men of that much abused class, won the heart of her sprightly
step-daughter. Years afterV when Nettie was a young lady, this
kind mother died, leaving her three little boys to the care of an
ambitious and unloving father.
Capt. Arnold was a man of whose preference one might feel
proud, but his love was cruel in its exactions. His children
learned to revere him for his learning, and to fear him. He put
them to school, separating them from their sister, who gained his
displeasure by coming between the motherless boys and his wrath.
She was taken by a maiden aunt, but a life of luxury and fashion
did not cause her to forget the little brothers who looked up to
her as to a mother.
One there was, the youngest, who especially needed a
mother's or a sister's care. His erratic and poetic fancies erected
a barrier between him and his father, and, in a measure, separated
him from his-brothers. His father was extremely harsh toward
him, frequently chastising him for some slight offence until the
blood ran down. Ah! mistaken parent ! Love could have bent
him to any shape, but force never. Could he change his nature
Was it his fault that he took more pleasure in wild romances and
strange weird poetry than in more solid learning? As well might
the Ethiopian hope to change his skin, or the leopard his spots, as
to try to force Edgar Arnold to think or act like other children,
by the use of the rod or harsh words. Had his mother lived or
his sister been permitted to superintend his education, he could
have been led along, his mind trained, and his wild imaginings so
tempered and directed that' he might have become a bright and
shining light in the world of science and literature. As it was,
he grew up, reading- voraciously everything which he could find
suited to his taste, gleaning much that was grand and beautiful,
while his nature was warped and his feelings distorted by the
vicious associations which surrounded him. Not one care for the
moral training of his children ever actuated Capt. Arnold in his
selection of a school for them. So their heads were filled with a
certain number of dead and~ modern languages, it mattered not

with him that their Sabbaths were spent in fishing or hunting
with the lowest class, and their young lips learned to frame the
most horrid oaths.
Ere the school days ended, while Edgar was, yet in his teens,
the war for Southern independence began, and the three brothers
left school to join the army. The older boys were killed in battle
in the early part of the way. Edgar, in the school of reckless dis-
sipation, so ruinous to many of our promising young men, which
the army opened before him, found ample exercise for his peculiar
talent. Brave as any mortal could be, he fought regard-ess of
danger, until a severe wound disabled him for farther service.
With no definite aim in life, no idea of the value of time or
money, he became a wanderer, squandering hundreds of dollars
as recklessly as he exposed his life in battle.
Years passed. The war ended and left Edgar Arnold without
fortune, and without any ideas of making a living. He wandered
cast and west, north and south, making a little money occasion-
ally by his wits as reporter for newspapers, auctioneer, &amp;c. His
sister, with her aunt, visited a farm belonging to the former, near
where her father had settled ,after the war, and remained several
months. She had heard where Edgar was and had written to
him to meet her there. He went and remained with her until she
returned with her aunt, when he went off to seek his fortune.
She offered to remain on-the farm if he would settle down there
with her. His recklessness grieved her very much. His father
hated him because he was what he had made him, and was very
cross with his daughter because of her affection and pity for this
only brother.
They left the farm to its tenants, and he was not heard of
again for two years, when the old farm-house was fitted  up, and
Miss Nettie Arnold and her brother, with a little babe, took pos-
session and settled down there. 0, the babel of tongues that
were put in motion then ! She who had been petted and flattered
only two years ago, was now the\ subject of the vilest abuse.
Her father fumed and fretted for one year, then died cursing his
children, refusing to let his daughter approach him, though she
begged to be permitted to attend him in his illness. His harsh-
ness increased the slanders, until Miss Arnold's name was blacker

han that of the vilest wretch that ever lived. She and her
brother were accused of living in incest ; not more than one or
two families believed-her innocent. She lived on quietly for three
years, keeping the even tenor of her way, with no society, noth-
ing but her books, and the little innocent committed to her care.
Her brother seemed changed. He seemed to live but for the in-
mates of that old farm-house. People wondered, but did not try
to find out the truth of the stories afloat, except from the negroes
employed on the place. Had one told them it was all false, they
loved the morsel of slander too well to wish to believe it.- If
Miss Arnold ever heard the scandalous stories, she did not, seem
to notice them. If she shed bitter tears in secret, her kind (?)
neighbors were none the wiser.
Three years passed and new subjects satisfied the morbid appe-
tites of the scandal-loving community. Then Edgar sought and
obtained business in a distant county. His sister could not re-
main there alone, so she packed up and left the farm, for her home
with her aunt. The tempest which was thought to have subsided,
was only lulled for a while. It broke out with fresh fury. Miss
Arnold's departure was positive proof that she was not what she
should be, she was running away to hide her shame. . A few who
visited her before she left, knew better, and tried to offer their
testimony in her behalf, but in vain. The negroes said so, and
they knew.
One who felt well assured of Miss Arnold's innocence made
inquiries of friends in a town in which Edgar had resided just
before his return with his sister to her farm, and received the
following reply :
Sir:-In reply to your inquiries respecting Edgar Arnold, I
am at perfect liberty to tell a little story, which I am happy to do,
since it will clear Miss Arnold from the stigma which her brother's

vated as his had been. She Was ignorant of the ways of the
world, and loved him with her whole soul. lie loved her madly,
passionately, asone of his nature is capable 'of loving but once in
a life-time. With no definite idea of how ,he was to live, with
no thought, of the consequences, he, with his usual impetuosity,
gave himself up to this first dream of love. Enough that they
loved, not wisely, but too well. A few months of delirium passed,
and the necessity for replenishing his purse caused him to seek
his fortunes in a far Western State. le left with the promise of
returning and claiming his love as a bride. He had barely settled
down to business in the far West, when a letter, sixty days old,
reached him,-recalling him in haste to Virginia. The intelli-
gence caused him the most intense agony. lie was far from, any
public conveyance, and delays chafed and fretted him into a bi'ain
fever, which brought him near to death's door. When at length
he reached this place, a mere wreck of his former self, he found a
new-made grave in the cemetery, and a wee baby in the poor-
house. His remorse and agony were pitiful to behold. People
who had blamed him, pitied him when they saw how he mourned.
The young mother had died in the poor-house, broken-hearted,
deserted by every friend. He was too late to repair the wrong
done-the mother, but the helpless. infant awakened all the dor-
mant powers of his soul. Remorse for the past and a determin-
ation to repair the wrong as far as possible, led him to desire to
take the little one and raise it tenderly. But he was without
means, with no female' friend to whom he coid apply for aid ex-
cept his sister. He feared her strong sense of propriety, her horror
of all things wicked, would cause her to hate him and cast him
on. But he could do nothing more than throw himself upon her
mercy. So he wrote, detailing the circumstances in full, and in
reply received a letter full of sympathy and promises of aid. Her
aunt would not agree to her taking the infant to her house. She
was not related to Edgar, and dreaded the scandal it might occa-
sion. Miss Nettie was at the Virginia springs, in the height of
the season of enjoyment, but she left it all. Her brother met her
with the habe at a depot, and they hastened to that out of the
way farm-house, where Miss Nettie has been immured as in a
dungeon for three years, until b  health has failed so sensibly she

her harshness toward the little stranger, and has. been for two
years begging her niece to return. She has remained there, sub-
ject to the greatest slanders, with the hope of doing good, of
reclaiming her brother, and she has accomplished much. I trust
she will have her reward. Edgar's life seems bound up' in the
child, and he has settled down to business, with the determination
to have her raised and educated in a proper manner. With the

WHAT NOVEL READING DID FOR ME.
BIRDIE, RAT'S STORY.
At eighteen I was as blithe as any bird. I went about my
household duties singing so gayly that the pet name given to me
in babyhood by my dear, indulgent father, clung to mle long after
my mother told me childish things should have been put away.
My mother was a prim, precise woman, kind-hearted in her way;
but her way was one few understood, and fewer still liked. She
had a rule for everything, and woe betide that person, be it
husband, child or servant, who transgressed one of her rules or
laws. She had taken great pains with my education, superinten-
ding that important business herself, as she did everything else
about the premises. Now that teachers were no longer need d, she
undertook to make me a good housewife. I followed her until I
could do almost-everything she could do, and she came to the con-
clusion that I was.sufficiently wise to become mistress of an estab-
lishment of my own. Here she was ready for me. A well-to-do
farmer, steady and economical, bearing the very euphonious
cognomen Tom Jones, and whose peculiar religious views just
suited my mother, was her choice as a husband for me. I liked
Mr. Jones well enough as a neighbor, but the idea of accepting
him as my husband was simply absurd. He was twenty years
my senior ; but his age was not the greatest point of difference
between us. ' He was stern and bigoted, with no pity for erring
humanity, and, like my mother, with no patience with any one.
who dared to oppose his peculiar views in any matter, let it -.be
ever so trivial. I would as soon have thought of burying myself
alive as of uniting my destiny with that of one so directly oppo-
site in every particular. Besides, I. had my predilections, as most
girls of eighteen have. . Paul Clayton and I had roamed the forests
and fields around our childhood'shome since our earliest recollec-

tions. He had been my protector and my beau-ideal, since his
father had died and left him to the care of my father, with a mod-
erate fortune, which had been very nearly spent in obtaining a
medical education, which he desired. We had grown up loving
each other dearly, and with the tacit understanding that- we be-
longed to each other. My father, who loved Paul as a son, en-
couraged our affection.
My mother was always kind to him, but he was not her idea
of a protector for a woman. He was too young, only two years
my senior, and was. too child-like in his affections., But the
greatest objection was his want of fortune. Mr. Jones was one of
the wealthiest farmers in the county. His house was well fur-
nished, and his farm splendidly stocked. She thought me highly
honored by his preference, and was astonished that I did not
view the case in the same light. I laughed at the idea, until I
found how much in earnest she was. Payl was poor in compar-
ison with Mr. Jones, but what cared I for that ? He was at a med-
ical college, and would come home in a few months to commence
the practice of medicine in our neighborhood. Mother feared
his coming, and it was her policy to have me married as soon as
possible.
Mr. Jones came every day to talk with my mother about the
proper management of his dairy and poultry-yard, and to tell
her the old, old story --how much clear cash his farm yielded
him every year. She would tell him how rapidly I had progressed
in my education in all useful things, what nice butter I could
make, and what a dutiful child I was, until he thought I was just
the wife he wanted - young, pretty, sprightly and a good house-
keeper. 0, how I was learning to hate him! It was a bitter ex-
perience I was passing through, and I could not love my, perse-
cutors. The more I strove to overcome my repugnance to him,
-the more I-hated him, until, strange and unnatural as it may
appear, I almost hated my mother too. I pleaded with her not
to sacrifice her only child to a life of misery. She taunted me
with preferring that poverty-stricken medical student, and bade
me overcome- any such feelings, as wed Mr. Jones. I must and
should. I went to my father, and found sympathy and love, but
he durst not counsel opposition to her will. He had yielded so

long he did not know how to rebel now. Oh how miseralble I
was! What should I do? If she persisted I must be Mr. Jones'
slave.
I cried myself to sleep that night. The next morning I wrote
to Paul and begged him to tell me what to do ; I was to be an un-,
willing bride in three months. In two weeks he came. lie went
to my father and begged him to interpose his authority to save.
his child. My father was deeply affected and promised to do what
he could, but could give him no hope, as he had spoken to my
mother upon the subject several times without effect. We were
as miserable as lovers could well be under the circumstances. I
had wept until I was almost ill, and he was trying to persuade me
to elope with him, when Mr. Jones was announced, and my pres-
ence was desired in the parlor, I ran to my room, bathed my
eyes until they lost their swollen appearance, when they fell upon
a book Paul had brought me - Marion Iarland's. first book,
"Alone."' I took it up and turned it about in my hands mechan-
ically. I had been too miserable to look at the name until then.
I just then remember d that Mr. Jones tabooed all novel-reading
as fearfully wicked-an unpardonable sin. A bright thought
flashed upon my mind, and I went down to the parlor with the
book in my hands, my finger between the leaves as if I had been
reading when he came. My greeting was more cordial than
usual, and he rubbed his lean, money-grasping fingers together
in ecstasy. le drew his chair up to me, and attempted to take
my hand in his, when I turned the book, partially open, so that
the title-page might meet his eye. The movement attracted his
attention, and he exclaimed, "Al]! what is that ? Not a novel, I
hope'?" and he drew back as though it was a serpent. I looked
up to him with a smile as I replied, " Yes, sir, it is a novel. You
do not object to my reading novels, do you?" "Object to it !"
he asked, as he rose and stood before me. "You surely do not
read such trash? I thought your mother had trained you differ-
ently."  I drew a long sigh and said, "I am very sorry, sir, you
object so strongly to such reading. My father does not disapprove
of it indeed, I read to him a great deal. I greatly prefer it to house-.
keeping, and I have hoped that you would supply me with as
many books as I. wish when you take me home. It will be so

lonely there without novels." "Margaret," he said, very soi-
etnnly (lie and mother always called me Margaret, everybody else
called mne Birdie), "you do not know how very wicked it is to
read such stuff. Your father has done wrong to encourage any
such taste in you. But you are so young, you will soon overcome
the desire. When other duties press upon you, you will not care
for books, except your Bible. You will not read any more, for my
sake, will you ? You cannot have read many ?" I looked down
in seeming confusion, but really in triumph, as I said, so low he
had to bend to catch the words, " Indeed, sir, I have read a good
many. I like them, 0 so-much ! I fear I shall never cease to care for
them. I have read ten thousand a year, and-" "Good Heavens!"
he cried, "that is impossible ! You would not read that number
in a life-time." I drew up indignantly, as I said, "I hope you
do not doubt my word, sir. My father can testify to the truth of
what I say ; more than that, I think I shall read more this year
than I ever did before, as I have already read eighteen hundred
and twelve, and this is only the tenth of January. My eyes are
itching now to begin this one."
Words are inadequate to describe his appearance. With his
long bony fingers clutching the back of the chair, he was staring
at me with open mouth and distended eyes until I ceased speak-
ing, when he drew back to the other side of the room, as if he
feared I might take forcible possession of him, soul and body.
He seized his hat and backed himself out of the room, with his
eyes still fixed upon me with horror. Without a. word of adieu
he left, and was soon galloping down the road as though Beelze-
bub were at his heels. I hastened to the library; lest mother
should come to know the cause of Mr. Jones' abrupt departure.
Father and Paul enjoyed the description I gave them of the in-
terview. We were still enjoying the afternoon, with more of
cheerfulness and hope than I had felt for a- long while, when my
mother came in with an open ote in her hand. Her eyes were
like blazing coals, while he; ce was deadly pale. She stood be-
fore me, and asked, sternly, " Margaret, what did you do or say
to offend Mr. Jones this afternoon? ". I looked her in the face,
as I replied, calmly and respectfully, "Mother, I was very polite
to Mr. Jones. You know I have never been more than that ;

could not be." "Did you tell him you loved another ?" "No,
madam, I did not." She handed the note to father, who read it,
and with a well-simulated air of displeasure, handed it to me,
saying, " Read that, Birdie, and see how you are jilted." I took it,
glanced over it, then read aloud :
"Mr. Thomas Jones declines the honor of Miss Margaret Ray's
hand in marriage, as he has become fully satisfied of the fact that
she does not suit him at all, and hopes her mother will consider
the engagement at an end from date."
It was with the greatest difficulty I could refrain from giving
expression to my great joy in some extravagant manner. I had
to .bury my face in my hand to conceal the joyous light of my
eyes. As soon as I could command my voice, I looked up and
said, "Mother, we had better sue him for breach of promise."
"Margaret !" was all her indignation would permit her to say.
Paul arose and went to her, and said, " Mrs.. Ray, give your
daughter to me. You have been amother to me for ten years.
I thank you deeply for your past kindness; grant me this greatest
of all boons, and I will be a son indeed to you. She loves me,"
as you well know. The wedding-day need not be changed ; we
will only change the bridegroom. Believe me, dear mother, you
shall never regret giving her to me." . She sank upon a chair and
laid her head on a table before her. I knelt before her and laid
my head on her knee. Her arm was thrown around me, and she
said, "My dear child, I have been a harsh mother;- but God
would not let me sacrifice you to my ambition. Take her, Paul,
and make her happier than I would, have done."
Years have passed, and if the reader will call at Dr. Clayton's
residence, he will see as happy a family as can be found in this
world. Father and mother come. to see us very frequently.
Father is the same good, affectionate being he always was, only
he is much happier, because of the change in mother. She is so
much more considerate of his wishes and feelings, so much' tenderer
and sympathetic. Between the two my little ones are in danger
of being badly spoiled. I must bid you adieu, as Paul has come
in to dinner, and J must not neglect him, dear, good soul that he is!
Tom Jones has never married. Somehow the trick I played
him was too good to be kept secret, and it reached his ears. lie
has never forgiven me.

All of Angelica Dashwood's friends were in raptures. She,
the youngest daughter of the family, was going to marry George
Goodman, the steadiest, most pious, and wealthiest young man in
the whole country around. She had other suitois - one was more
suited to her tastes than Mr. Goodman. Oscar Overton was gay,
fascinating, and a spendthrift ; yet Angelica encouraged him, and
liked him as well as one of her selfish nature could do. But
sober reason told her he would never do., He could not keep up
the .style both loved so well for any length of time, as his patri-
mony was fast disappearing from his loose grasp, while there
would be long division of her father's estate. George Goodman
had a good home, and everything to render any reasonable person
happy. With his steady habits and well-known industry and
business tact, he need not fear failure. He was the safest chance,
and accept him she must, and did, despite the fluttering of her
small heart.
The wedding day came, and with it a select and gay company

he loved his bride, and she had led him to believe' he was her
choice of all the world, her heart's king.
They went to their home amid the congratulations and-good
wishes of many friends. He had spent hundreds of dollars in
fitting up his country home for.her he loved so fondly, and he
blindly thought she would be perfectly happy with, him, and love
him more than ever for anticipating her wishes in so many things.
Bitter indeed was his disappointment. She kept up a show of
pleasure and affection until the friends who accompanied them

home had departed. Then her true disposition was revealed.
Her husband found that his purse was his chief attraction in the
eyes of his wife. He did all he could to please her, but that was
an impossibility. Industry, piety, and a love of home had wedded
pride, selfishness, and a love of display.  Of. course there
could be no happiness in such a union. Constant fretting and
fault-finding left their traces, and her beauty soon vanished.
After many vain efforts to make her at least satisfied with her lot,
George Goodman turned to his farm and stock for diversion,
trying to bear with resignation the miserable fate of a loveless
existence.
SWe need not look far for another example. Edward Gay is
handsome, and has large expectations., Ie has a dashing style
about him which is very attractive to many young ladies, dresses
elegantly and travels in splendid style, has plenty of ready money
which he spends freely. Strange to tell, he chooses his opposite
in every respect except in fortune; and, stranger still, Mary
Moore, who has known him from childhood, knows all his
crooked ways, loves him, and society in general cries out "A
very suitable match."
Time passes swiftly amid the hurry and confusion of prepa-
tions for a big wedding.
They are united in bonds which should be holy, but are any-
thing elsetin the estimation of the bridegroom. The bride is
lovely in face, form and character, and he fancies that he loves
her. He will be very devoted until the novelty of his new rela-
tion wears off, which will not be long, for a man so void of true
nobility of soul, so wedded to sinful pleasures, cannot be con-
tented long without indulgence. God pity the sweet young bride !
So pure, so loving, her beauty, grace and accomplishments wasted
upon one so unworthy !
It is anything but strange that her cheeks grow pale, and her
step, so buoyant only a few short months ago, should grow weary
and slow, or that she seeks her mother's loving heart for comfort
ed affection.
Of all the sad situations in life, this must be the saddest. Yet we
see .it so frequently. How few are the really matched, and how
very many the mismatched couples that go out to begin life as
one in heart and purpose.

I do not oppose matrimony - nay, I believe a happy marriage
is a state more nearly approximating heaven than any other can
be ;. yet I would warn my young friends to look well before you
enter that state. Try to be equally yoked.- Let fortune be the

CHAPTER I.
Mr. Conrad was one of the wealthiest merchants of Charleston.
His family consisted of himself, his wife (a showy woman of the
world), his daughter (a gay and exceedingly fashionable young
lady of sixteen), and his orphan niece, Clare Conrad, the only
child of a beloved brother, who died when she was very young,
leaving his motherless little girl to the care of his wealthy and
kind-hearted brother. The little property he left her was barely
sufficient to afford her the education he coveted for his sprightly
child.
Mrs. Conrad insisted that it was a useless waste of her little
patrimony to send Clare'; to the best- schools. If she could be
taught the rudiments of english it would Dbe amply sufficient ;
but her husband disagreed with her, and his niece shared every
advantage so lavishly bestowed upon his petted daughter. At the
'early age of sixteen they were considered finished by the faculty
of a fashionable female college.
Cora Conrad, the petted child of fortune, possessed a quick
mind, and would have made a brilliant scholar but for her indo-
lence, and for having been humored to so great an extent by her
mother. Clare had assisted her with her lessons, and stimulated'
her to a little exertion by appeals to her pride, so that she con-
trived by some means to be pushed through the course, and re-
ceived"her diploma at the same time that Clare graduated with
honpr.
Clare was a natural student. She sought knowledge because

she loved it ; and despite her poverty, became the favorite of her
teachers and classmates whom she iielped out of many a difficulty
by her ready wit. Unlike many hard students, she was the picture
of health and happiness. Her summer vacations had been spent
with her mother's sister in Virginia. The three months spent
with her uncle and-aunt Berkley, on the old Virginia farm, were
bright spots in the life of the imaginative and nature-loving child,
and her visits were ever a source of pleasure to the inmates of
the farm-house and their neighbors.
At the opening of my story the two girls had left school and
were ready to enter society as young ladies. Cora was a proud
beauty, whose fortune made Sher an object of particular interest
to a host of young men, and her advent was hailed with delight
by the votaries of fashion.  rs. 'onrad, to whom her husband
left the matter of dress, did ot think it incumbent upon her to
spend so much money upon a   or orphan as.she did upon her
own daughter ; consequently, she could not go into society upon
the same footing. Our little student had too much pride to force
herself forward, and when her uncle asked why she did not ac-
company her aunt and cousin when they went out, or appear in
the parlor more frequently, she gave as a reason that she liked
better to stay with him, or to read in her own room when he was
out. She was so young and petite, no one thought she was as old
or as learned as Cora, and she was not missed.
When Mrs. Conrad and Cora started to Saratoga, Mr. Conrad
insisted that Clare should accompany them; but mudh as she de-
sired to see Niagara, which they would visit,'she saw too plainly
that her aunt did not wish her to go ; therefore she declined, and
stopped, as usual, with her relatives in Virginia.
Mrs. Conrad had hinted to her frequently, that as so much of
her property had been spent upon her education, she ought to
obtain a situation as teacher, so as to be independent of her rela-
tives. She had spent many hours planning the future, all the
while busy with her books, so as to be competent to fill a posi-
tion, should she be so fortunate as to find one. When she left
Charleston she had fully determined to remain with the Berkleys
until she could find employment, knowing that she would find a
welcome there. Her aunt had two little daughters old enough to
be at school; she would insure a welcome by teaching them.

Cora loved Clare better than she did any one else, and better
than everything except her own ease, and really wished her to
accompany her, since Clare bad such an exquisite taste in dress
and knew instinctively what suited her style, thereby saving her
any thought upon the subject. Then she was so plain and unpre-
tending, there was no danger of rivalry. True, she was the wisest
little body she knew ; a great deal smarter than herself; but she'
was too modest to push herself forward, and no one would ever
suspect- her of being a walking cyclopedia.
For once she was denied the privilege of having her own way,
but promised to write occasionally and tell Clare everything that
occurred...

CHAPTER II.
Let us look in upon the family at," Solitude," in the interior of
the Old Dominion. Everything upon the farm presents the
appearance of thrift,,and intelligence. The yard is a pattern of
beauty and order. The house is commodious and built more for
comfort than show, painted white, with green blinds, and almost
covered with honeysuckles, jasmines and roses.-
Merry peals of laughter from the dining-room draw us irresis-
tibly in that direction, and we stand unperceived upon the long
porch and look through the low window, seeing as happy a group
as it has ever been our good fortune to look upon.
Mr. Berkley, a noble-looking - man, apparently about forty
years of age, sits with an open letter in his hand, which seems to
afford food for the merriment which evidently reigns to the ex-
clusion of the inviting supper spread before them. Glare has two
letters and a package of papers, but has not broken the seal of
either. Let us see what it is that amuses them so. We cannot
do better than read it out:,
Dear Uncle Alf: What shall I do ? Here I am. at Saratoga'
with a party from New York, looking for pleasure, and -finding
rooms crowded to suffocation, &amp;c., &amp;c., ad infinitum - anything,
in fact, but pleasure. Some seem to enjoy it, but I can't.. I am

sick of it all: The parlors are crowded with the beauty of the
United States. I am accustomed to fashionable society, but am
particularly loaded with ennui this season. When I leave my
office in the city I want rest for body and mind, not the whirl of
a fashionable watering-place. .I scarcely know whether I am
standing on my head or myheels.
The newest sensation is a young authoress from Charleston.
She has burst upon the reading public as suddenly as the flash of
a meteor, and as brightly. .1 am forced to acknowledge there is
power and beauty in her writings. She writes sketches and poems
for a leading New York paper. If I had not seen the authoress
here, the gayest of the gay in dress, but really too lazy to try to
make herself agreeable, or to let people hear her say some of the
pretty things she writes so gracefully, I could go into raptures
over her articles.
But for the unvarying ink-drop on her middle finger, and the
lateness of her appearance in the morning, you would never sup-
pose this authoress ever handled a pen. I'have always had a
horror of literary women, and no fortune nor beauty could induce
me to make such a woman my wife. I believe I forgot to tell you
her name. She is a Miss Conrad, from Charleston, very wealthy
and a beauty. She writes over the initials C. C. But enough of
this. I write.to tell you I shall be with you at " Solitude " by
the 15th instant. The very name is suggestive of freedom from
pert misses, manoeuvring mammas and authoresses. With much
love to aunt Clara and the children,
I am, as ever, your terribly bored,
But affectionate nephew,
HARRY PAGE.
" What do you think- of my gallant nephew, Clare ?" asked
Mr. Berkley, as he folded the letter.
"o, uncle Alfred ! I was only waiting permission to speak, to
say'I am very sorry he's coming. I. shall be so afraid of shocking
his sensibilities. Nettie and I can never climb another fruit tree,
or ride after the cows, or even laugh loud again after his lordship
appears. Are you not sorry, Nettie ?" she asked, with a smile
lurking around the corners of her mouth.

Nettie looked up with astonishment.
"No, I am real glad. You don't know cousin Harry. - He is
the ' darlingest' cousin in the world except you, and I am deter-
mined you shall like him. 0, cousin Clare, he will climb the big
pear tree for us. He was here for a week last winter, and he
snow-balled with us children, just like he was one of us; and he
is so handsome, and laughs as loud and as much as anybody. 0
we had a jolly time when he was here. I am glad, ain't you,
Minnie ?"
Mrs. Berkley expressed her pleasure also at the promised visit.
Glare. said she was hungry after having been busy drying
fruit and making preserves all day, so they turned to the supper
table, talking all the while, and doing justice to the cook's su-
perior qualities.
After the meal was partaken of, Clare said she would read
her letters. Perhaps she might find something from Saratoga
also. The first was from her uncle, a kind, fatherly letter, full of
regrets at her absence, and of hopes that she was enjoying her-
self. Then came what she was looking for, an account .of his'
visit to the editor of the  '-, of New York, and his acceptance
of her ai-ticles, with the hope that she would favor him with some
more of the same sort, and making her an- offer of a stated sum
per month for regular contributions. He had never known so
much talent displayed by one so young. 0, how the blood leaped
in her veins, how her heart beat, and the hot flush mounted to
cheek and brow. 'This was more than she had dared to dream of.
Mrs. Berkley noticed. the excitement 'under which she was
laboring, and asked what it all meant. She passed the letter to
her, then going around to where she sat, dropped on the floor,
and put her head on her knee,.as she said, "Read it, dear Auntie.
I am so proud and so happy."1
Mrs. Berkley read the letter and handed it to her husband,
saying, "I am astonished beyond measure. Why, Clare, who
would have thought my happy-hearted little niece an authoress?
And it is you, not Cora, who wrote those articles Harry compli-
mented so much. The same initials too. How small it seems in
her, to wish to rob my little girl of her honors. How surprised
Harry will be to find he has run away from a supposed authoress
to meet the real one here in his retreat."

Clare.started up. "But, Auntie, you must not -tell him. Let
him think me only a wild, happy child. I would not spoil his
enjoyment of 'Solitude' for anything. Let him still think Cora
the writer of those articles. I think we can prove to him that a
writer need not be such.a bore, nor need she carry an ink-spot on
her finger as an insignia of her profession. I have written
several articles since I have been with you, and you have not sus-
pected it. Please, auntie, and you, uncle, don't tell him. Let him
find it out himself. I only wish to teach him a lesson."
The required promise was given, and she opened and read
her letters while her uncle and aunt looked over the papers and
found the articles mentioned by Harry Page.
Clare's other letter was from Cora, the first she had written.
It was tolerably long for her to write, and gave a gloomy account
of her pleasures at her hotel; but the main feature of the letter
was an extravagant eulogium of a Mr. Page, from Richmond,
Virginia, who was there with some friends from New York. He
was described to be as handsome as Apollo, and as wise as all the
philosophers and sages together. "I wish you could see him,
Clare," she wrote, "and the strangest part is, some one is writing
for a New York paper over my initials, and the rumor has gone
abroad that the beautiful and wealthy Miss Conrad, of Charleston,
is the author. Those are the very words. Mr. Page thinks it is
true, and I am so anxious to please him, until I can get him to
love me for something else than my wisdom. I can't say that I
love him; I believe I am too indolent for any strong feeling, but
I like him much. more than any one else I have ever met with.
0, Clare, only think of my putting ink on my finger every morn-
ing, when these are the first lines I have written since I left
home. I think I hear you exclaim, ' Really, Cora' must be in
love !'

CHAPTER III.

The afternoon of the 14th of August had arrived. There was
a pleasant bustle of preparation at " Solitude," for the expected
arrival of Harry Page on the morrow. Mr. Berkley and his little

daughter Mimile had ridden over to the depot to get the mail.
Mrs. Berkley was very busy in the dining-room. Nettie was dec-
orating the mantels with fresh flowers, all the while talking about
"cousin Harry," who was expected on the early morning train,
and would be there before she could have time to cut fresh flowers
in the morning. Little Alfred,"a pretty, sprightly boy of two years,
was begging " tousin Tare" to run wnth him. The last cake had
been brought in and pronounced " fit for the President." Without
waiting to unpin her sleeves, or let down her curls, which were
pinned back very carelessly, to keep them out of her way while'
at work, Clare caught up the child and began to waltz with him
on her shoulder, all the while humming a favorite waltz., Once
she stopped and said to heraunt, "Don't be afraid of my hurting
Allie. I feel full of frolic this evening, as it is to be my last day
of freedom for some time. By the way, auntie, did Mr., Page
never hear of your niece ?"..
"Yes, the children talked about you so much when he was
here last, he said he was really jealous of ' that cousin Clare.'
" Well, then, is it not strange that he should have written so
freely about Cora, if he knew, t at I was a Conrad, and from
Charleston? How did he know bt t she was your niece? I begin
to think he is ill-natured or impolite," and she stood patting her
foot, as she looked down seriously.
Mrs. Berkley replied, " My dear, I don't think Harry knows
that you are a Conrad. The children spoke of you as cousin Clare,
and Mr. Berkley merely told' him- you were my niece, without
'giving your full name. I am sure.he would not say or write any-
thing he thought would wound my feelings."
"Well, auntie, I want you to introduce me to him as Miss
Conrad, of Charleston, South Carolina. Be sure to say it all, now,
that's a .dear, good auntie. But Alhie is impatient for another
dance, so here goes.".
She flew around the room with thechild laughing and clingig
to her neck, nor stopped until she ran into the arms of a gentle-
man who had entered the room unperceived, and was standing
near the door. Twilight was gathering fast and objects were not
very distinct, so he was a little excusable for folding his arms
around her and kissing her rosy lips twice before he released her,
as he said:

"Why, Nettie, how you have grown; just as wild as ever
though. That is right, be happy as long as possible."
But, surely that could not be Nettie. How she withdrew from
his arms, and, after a look of surprise and indignation, ran from
the room. In the hall she met her uncle and Minnie, and was
hurrying past them when Alfred called "Papa," and refused to go
farther. She stopped to relinquish the child, when Mr. Berkley
got a sight of her face, and said, " Why, bless the child! What
is the matter, Clare ? Have you seen a ghost ?"
Just then Harry Page, for he it was, as my reader has doubt-
less guessed, came forward and said, " I thought it was Nettie,
and must have frightened her by my affectionate greeting. It is
Miss Henry, I suppose, Minnie's cousin Clare."
Mrs. Berkley came forward then and said : "This is my
niece, Miss Clare Conrad, of Charleston, South Carolina. But,
Harry, how did you get here without letting us know you were
coming? We looked for you on the morning train."
Harry hastened to expl in that he got too impatient, and came
twelve hours sooner than he intended when he wrote and having
met his uncle very opportunely at the depot, came out in his
buggy. He was very sorry he had so surprised and frightened
Miss Conrad. He hoped she would not bear malice against him,
but prove herself the kind-hearted cousin Minnie had been so
lavishly praising on their way home. He turned to where he had
seen her standing, but she was gone.
An hour later when the supper bell rang, she came from her
room looking like a subdued fairy. Mr. Page thought he had
never seen so complete a metamorphosis. He had not thought it
possible that so child-like a person could assume so much dignity.
She was very simply, yet tastefully arrayed in white muslin, with
a blue ribbon around her neck and another twined among her
auburn ringlets. Her dark blue eyes had a deeper lustre, and a
perceptible flush mantled her cheek, as she took the seat assigned
her at table, directly opposite the person she wished to shun--
Mr. Harry Page. She could not resist the temptation to raise
her eyes once as she took her seat, but, encountering such an ear-
nest, serious gaze from a pair of magnificent black eyes, her lids
dropped immediately, while the long lashes touched her cheek,

and were not raised again until, the meal was nearly concluded,
when Mr. Berkley said :
" You have not asked me a word about the mail, Clare. Have
you forgotten your papers ?"
She raised her eyes quickly enough now, and took the papers
and a letter from her uncle. She smiled as she saw the familiar
chirography, and said " from Saratoga." Mrs. Berkley asked if
it was from Cora.
"0, no," she said, " it is from uncle William. ;j suppose Cora
is too busy writing for the press to think of me more than -once a
month.'
She looked up at Mr.. Page, and was pleased to note the effect,
of her words. He bit his lip, while the hot blood rushed to ,his
forehead, and he did not raise his eyes from his plate. She
lingered until- the gentlemen had repaired to the veranda, then
she read her uncle's affectionate letter. Her perverse spirit which
had possessed her so unnaturally, vanished, and when Mrs. B.
had assisted in clearing away the supper table, and had seen
Minnie to bed, she accompanied her to the parlor, where they
were joined by the gentlemen.
Henry Page was a true-gentleman, and beneath the easy grace
of his manner and conversation Clare forgot her own embarrass-
ment, and found herself talking and laughing as naturally as
though no one was present except the home circle, and when she
was requested to sing, she complied without hesitation. She pos-
sessed a sweet, flexible voice, and nothing suited her so well as a
simple ballad, in which Harry joined with a splendid tenor. It
was late ere they separated that night. As the good nights were
repeated, Harry said, with a look of wishful entreaty :
"I hope Miss Conrad does not cherish any ill feeling toward
me for my very unceremonious greeting this evening, or for my
remarks relative to her cousin. You must think me very ill
natured and unmannerly to write such things, but I had not the
most remote idea that Miss Cora Conrad was, in any way, con-
nected with a member of aunt Clara's family. You were always
spoken of as 'cousin Clare' by the children, and I supposed you
were the daughter of aunt's brother, and bore her maiden name.
Can you forgive me and let say cousin Clare, too ? Miss Conrad

is so stiff, and has such an unpleasant association since my un-
happy faux pa."
She gave him her hand with a smile and a pleasant "1 good
night," and he retired to dream of a pair of dark eyes raised to
his in frightened wonder as he clasped a flying figure in his arms.
Days passed. One- two weeks passed, and still he lingered.
"Solitude " was so pleasant a place he could not tear himself
away. "Cousin Harry " was the companion of all the rambles.
It was he who climbed the trees and shook down the ripe fruit;
he who. pulled down the clusters of grapes which were too high
for the girls to reach. He accompanied them in all their rides,
and sat with them while they sewed, or busied themselves about
household affairs. Clare was a capital hand at making pies, pick-
ling and preserving, and her hands were frequently stained with
fruit, though an ink-drop was never seen on her finger.
-" C. C.'s" articles were read and freely commented on each
week. Clare's .criticisms were more free and severe than any
other, and Harry was struck with the- correctness and force of
her comments. He found himself very frequently thinking that
Clare wag much more sensible, and seemed to think more deeply
and correctly than the author of these articles did. How could
.Cora Conrad write so very differently from the way she conversed
and acted; and how could she portray country life as her last
article did, when she was too indolent to enjoy it, if she ever
really was in the country ? It was an enigha he was unable to
solve.
A month had passed, and business calls were imperative. He
must leave on the morrow. He asked Clare to walk with him to
the grove, a favorite place of resort. They proceeded to the edge
of the wood, where they could sit and see the sun sinking behind
a distant mountain peak, leaving a track of crimson and gold
upon which Clare gazed in rapt adoration, unmindful of any
presence save that beauty which she worshipped, and she mur-
mured softly,

A slight movement caused her to remember thas sheo was not
alone. With a slight flush she turned, and said: "I do dearly

Â«I love all waste

She dropped her face upon her hands, which hed  ld, Hed
the hot tears forced their way through the closed lids. He
felt them upon his hand, and instantly oneh arm was around her,
and-her head pillowed on his breast, while he told her how truly
and devotedly he loved her. She waste her head and spoke

so low he had to bend his head to listen.
"But you will hate me w f I tell you how I have deceived

of such a thing as your love, I would have undeceived you long
ago. I have been very happy here with you, and will miss you
more than I can tell. I am very sorry I deceived you, and I hope
you will not hate me when you are gone."
She would have' withdrawn from his arms, but he drew her
closer, and raised her blushing face and placed upon her quiver-
ing lips the first kiss of love.
"That is for deceiving me so," he said. "Who would have
thought I was in love with an authoress? Yet it is even so, and
I would not have you other than you are, for the world. You
say you are not a beauty. Know, little one, that you are to me
the loveliest object on earth. Who could see that well-poised
head and look into those eyes so full of intelligence and goodness,
and not call you beautiful? Your cousin's queen-like figure and
lazy hauteur sink into insignificance before your superior beauty."
But, reader, we are de trop.
The announcement of the engagement did not surprise Mr.
and Mrs. Berkley in the least. It was no more than they ex-
pected, and just what they wished. Mrs. Berkley asked him how
he reconciled such a state of things with his former ideas con-
cerning literary women. He replied that Clare had taught him
that domestic industry and literature were not incompatible; that
one may be an authoress and know how to economise and con-
duct a home; also, that to write sound, healthy articles, one must
enjoy nature and keep a healthy mind in a healthy body, by a-
cheerful disposition, a good heart and a plenty of exercise.
Clare was so young, her aunt agreed with her that it was best
to wait a year before she became Mrs. Page. Harry urged a
.speedy union, but was overruled, and had to wait until the next
summer. Mr. Conrad would not hear to Clare's spending, the
winter in Virginia; she must spend the last winter of single bless-
edness with him. She went to him in December, and was quite
a lioness in the literary world. She received-compliments enough
to turn her head, had she been more fond of flattery than she was ;
but she passed through the gayety of a winter in that gay city
without change, and when the next June, Harry claimed her as
his bride, she was just as innocent and childlike in her simple
goodness as when first he met her.

a short while to sound the depth of Mr. Montgomery's mind. He
talked and questioned, without any apparent design, adroitly
drawing out his visitor, until he knew just how shallow he was.
When tea was announced Mr. Harper led the way, saying he
supposed Lula would meet them at the table, as she was his house-
keeper.- She did. so, looking very sweetly. There was a bright
spot on either cheek, which her father noticed, and said, " I fear
you are not well, Lula. You have hardly been youi-self for several
days, I do not wish my little girl to get ill. We will leave this
dull old house, and spend a few weeks in visiting, some friends,
together with a week or so at Newport. By that time you will
want rest and quiet, and I propose leaving you at Madame Know-
all's seminary for young ladies until you finish your education. . I
have neglected my poor, motherless darling long enough." "In-
deed, dear father, " she replied, " I have not been neglected ; I
have had teachers who instructed me in all things I wished to
learn, besides you are the best and most patient of teachers. I
cannot leave you here alone, indeed I cannot."-
"I will not be alone. The servants will do their duty, and I
will get my sister Mary to stay with me. You have roamed over
this old house, reading everything you can find, long enough.
You are old enough now to feel and know the value of education,
and I wish you to be behind no lady in solid learning or. in ac-
complishments.- I know ny-daughter regards her father'swishes
too well to offer any serious objections. I have long intended
this, but have neglected it, thinking it was time enough. I have
decided that you must go in a short while. We will go to see
your aunt Mary, and she will return with me."
Lula said nothing, but looked toward her admirer for defence.
He smiled at her, then turned to his host and said, "It is impos-
sible, sir, to gild refined gold. This neighborhood would lose one
of its chief attractions, in fact its brightest star, if your daughter
leaves it. I have an opportunity to know, sir, and I can confi-
dently affirm that there is not ,a better educated young lady in
the county. What more could you wish than that she have no
superior?" Politeness restrained the words that arose to the lips
of the father, and he said nothing more. Lula was not pleased
with her lover's boldness, and did not like the look of her father's

eyes as he turned to her, when they arose from the table, and
said, " You can retire, Lula; I think you are not well enough to
sit up late to-night. We will excuse you." Lula retired to her
room, and soon saw her lover galloping away, while her father
closed the doors. Soon he retired to his room, and all was quiet
in the house.
She sat long and sadly gazed abroad, thinking she was very
unhappy, but resolved to tell her father of her love, and she felt
sure that he who had never denied her any gratification of her
wishes, would not be rash with her now, when lifelong happiness
was concerned. She pondered upon how she was to tell hin.
She had been motherless from infancy. Her father had loved the
little helpless girl committed to his care by her dying mother too
entirely to seek another mistress of his fortune. No mother could
have been more tender, and never mother possessed the confidence
of her daughter more than he possessed hers. Yet this was a
happiness so new. She would have gone to him that evening
and told him all but for his strange treatment of her lover. Sleep
did not visit her eyelids until near morning, when her slumhbers
were disturbed by unpleasant dreams.
At breakfast she met her father, looking so pale and weary he
was really uneasy. As soon as they left the table he asked her to
go with him to the library. When they were seated, he put his
arm around her and drew her head upon his breast, as he said,
"Will not my darling tell her father what it is that troubles her?"
She replied by a gush of tears only. He let her sob awhile, then
he said, "I have been very wrong, my child, to look on you and
see your young heart going out to this stranger, without a word
of warning. - I have thought of you only as a.child too young and
childlike to love any but your father. Lula, dearest, you know I
love you above all the world. Your father's love has never failed
you, and he would cut his tongue out sooner than say anything
to wound you if it were not necessary. Listen to- me, Lula.
This man who has so charmed your innocent heart is shallow and
vain. I have watched and sounded him; I believe he is an un-
principled fortune-hunter. This is not very complimentary to
my sweet child, I know, but it is because I know you deserve a
better fate than a union with such a man. I warn you, and beg

you to listen to me now. I will not tell you that you shall not
accept his love, but 1 beg you to refuse him." " o, father, it is
unlike you to judge so harshly. You do not know how much
he loves me. All mn n, young men particularly, have not your
wisdom. If he is a stranger, we know his family. It is as old and
good as ours." The father's heart was sorely troubled, yet true
affection for his child urged him to do his duty, and he kissed her
pure brow as he replied, "I know you think, now, that your life
would be worthless without his love. I will not ask you to reject
him, but I 'have several reasons for insisting that you shall ncot
marry under five years. Your mother was too young and fragile
when I married, and her life was the forfeit. 'You are one year
younger than she was, and just as frail. For the sake of your
own precious life and health I have always intended to keep you
if possible from an early marriage. That is one reason ; another
is, that in five years from this time you will have seen more of
the world. Your mind will have expanded, and what seems per-
fection to you now will then seem very imperfect. When you
see him again, tell him that your father will not consent to your
marriage with any one under five years ; and should you disregard
his wishes in a matter so vitally important he will find another,
heir to his property, and you will not receive one cent." "0,
father, father, you are cruel to threaten me so !" she cried, as she
raised her head from his breast. "lHe does not care for wealth;
he would wed me-without a cent." "If he takes you in defiance
of my wishes he will certainly have to take you without a cent of
my property. You know that when I tell you anything posi-
t'ely I will not change. You can' tell him so."  She retired,
weeping, to her room, while her father sat long in sadness, pon-
dering over his daughter's troubles.
Soon a visitor was announced, and Mr. Harper was surprised
to see Mr. Montgomery. He had not expected him so soon. His
business, this morning, was -not with Miss Harper, but with her
father. He came to tell Mr. Harper of the great love he entertained
for his daughter ; in fact, it would be impossible' to live without her.
He believed he had won the priceless treasure of her love, and
would guard it through life as a sacred trust.. He spoke very
confidently, as if he felt no fear of refusal. He would have to "

return to the city in about six weeks, and wished to take her with
him as his bride. Mr. Harper listened quietly uutil he got through,
then politely, yet positively refused his consent to his daughter's
marrying any one under five years. " If you love her as you say
you do, you can wait that length of time. If at the expiration
of five years she is willing to marry you, and you are worthy of
her, I give my free consent, but not until then."
Lula heard that he was with her father and went out in the
grove to wait for him. When he left the house he wore a frown
upon his unusually smooth brow, which disappeared as he saw
her coming to meet him. There were traces of 'tears on her
cheelks, and he kissed. the sad face as he said, " We will be happy,
dearet, in spite of your father. He has an. insane idea in his
head that you must not marry under five years. Go with me, and
we will be as happy as the days are long. Don't shake your
head so dolefully, nay pretty, timid birdie. His anger will soon
blow over ; he loves you too well to be angry long. When you
are once all' my own, he will be sorry for his prohibition and
come to see you." "No, no, Julian, I know my father better
than you do. Dearly as he loves me, he would never forgive an
act of wilful disobedience, He says, if I disregard his wishes in
this matter he will give the whole of his property to some one
else, not One cent shall I have. Of course you, do not care for
the property, dear Julian; but I shall be very miserable with My
father's anger. He has never been unkind to me before, and I
believe he really thinks he has my interests at take, or he could
not be so harsh now." "Nonsense," he replied: "it  would be too
unnatural for him to cherish anger toward his $   gild. Go
with me, and you will see he is not so hard-hearted as you think
him. The idea of having you in a boarding-school for two or
three years, when you love me, and I love you so dearly. It is
absurd."  Still she shook her head. "If I go with voU. Juian. I
go as a pennyless bride. I know my father. His word is 'un-
changeable. We will wait awhile. Perhaps he will change when
he sees how true we are to our love. I will Zo to Madane's and
learn all I can, so as to be presentable to your city friends. You
will love me a great deal better then, Julian, when you see what
a polished lady I shall be." "No, that is impossible.' he replied ;
"you are all I could wish for now.

CHAPTER II.
" who loves, raves-'tis youth's frenzy-but the cure
Is bitterer still; as charm by charmunwinds
Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's
Ideal shape of such."-Byron.

Much more lover-like nonsense was spoken, and they parted.
In a few weeks she was at Madame Knowall's. She was too truly
sensible to disregard her own interests ; but applied herself assid-
uously to her studies, and no student made more rapid advance-
ment than she. For one year she heard from Julian frequently.
Then a longer silence became frequent, until another six months.
had passed, when she heard that he wedded a wealthy widow
whom he met at Saratoga. Her father wrote her a true letter of
sympathy, not one word of rejoicing that he was false. Its deli-
cacy touched her as nothing else could have done, and she replied
expressing her gratitude that he had been so observant of char-
acter as to prevent her marrying one with no depth of affection.
She heard through a friend of h rs near her own home that Julian
was recklessly dissipated and ha, wasted his own fortune, so'that
he married for some one to take care of him.
The months glided ,by and her school-days were near their
close. She looked forward with sincere regret to her emancipa-
tion. She could not forget her lover. It was not what he was,
but what he had been to her, she regretted. She looked upon him
as a hero;. and the thought that probably her refusal to wed him
caused him to act as he had done, made her sad at'times. It is a
very difficult matter for a woman to look with indifference upon.
the man she had once thought to walk through life with. Her
love invests him with a sacredness, a heroism which does not
belong to other men, and it tales years to forget, or to cease to
regret.
While Lula knew him unworthy, she could not forget or cease
to care for him. When her school-days were ended, and her
father saw, with regret, the tears fill her eyes as she neared the
spot where she had parted from her lover, so fondly, three years
ago, he determined to take her to Europe. She was passionately
fond of music and was no mean performer on piano and organ,
so he told her he would take her to Germany, where she could
have the assistance of the best teachers, hoping thereby to win
her to forgetfulness and to interest in society.

Five years have passed, and our heroine, weary of travel, turns
her face homeward once more. Surely she is one of fortune's
favorites. Wealth and title, which are so eagerly coveted by
many republican (!) Americans, were laid at her feet, and politely
yet firmly rejected. Therewas one hope yet in her heart which
she could not, drive out-; unworthy as she knew it to be of her
proud reason, yet it would not die, and until it was truly dead
she felt that she would be doing an act of injustice to give her
hand to another. No other man had power to stir her soul as
Julian Montgomery had done. Though she felt it to be sinful to
love him while he was the husband of another, she could not forget
him.
When she reached home, her father's house was thrown open
for the reception of visitors. Many of the friends of her child-
hood called, and were received with the charming simplicity of
years ago. During her absence a seminary for young ladies had
been started in a village within a mile of her home. The principal
was a gentleman of rare attainments; modest, yet stately, one
who, without vanity, knows that he is inferior to none.
"A combination, and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man."
Mr. Harper was not long in forming the acquaintance of Mr.
Goodwin. He was very much pleased with him and invited him to
:,      his house.
Mr. Goodwin had never seen Lula, and was surprised to find
her at the head of the household, and presiding with so much
grace. She was delighted with the knowledge of men and books

he so modestly displayed. There was nothing light or frivolous
about him, and when he praised her performance on the piano
and her singing, she knew that he meant just what he said.
With all his wisdom there was a deference to her opinions as if
he thought her a woman worthy of attention in matters of science.
Some men with more sound than sense think because an'opinion
is uttered by a woman it is worthless; and they utter nothing but
empty nothings in her presence as though she could not compre-
hend anything sensible. Ihave seen men turn off with a con-
temptuous sneer when a new book by a female was spoken of,
and say in such an emphatic way, "I never read anything written
by a woman:" I always think it a great pity that such men
should have been subjected to the humiliation of having a woman
for their mother. It is impossible to make a hero of such a man,
therefore I say Mr. Goodwin was superior to such a weakness.
He was really strong, inasmuch as he honored the weaker vessel.
He did not look upon woman as a domestic animal merely, but as
a reasoning being, and man's helpmeet in the true sense of the
word.-;
The months glided by, and Mr. Goodwin had become a regular
visitor at the farm-house, and was greeted with undisguised
pleasure by Lula and her father. He had heard all about her dis-
appointment, fo; what village of a hundred inhabitants does not
know every other person's business better than their own? He
remembered it all, while seeming not to hear. He did not credit
the story, until he had known her several months, and found that
she had rejected several of the most eligible offers she could have
had. Whenever a gentleman became pointed in his attentions
she seemed to shun him, and was sad for some time. One. year
after her return home she heard that Julian Montgomery's wife
was dead. They had never lived happily together. Now she
had died and left him the whole of her wealth. Would she ever
see him again, and was he much changed? were questions which
would arise when she tried hardest to keep them down.
Mr. Goodwin noted the change, and sighed to think her so
weak as to cling toisuch a hope all those years.. He had learned to
love the only woman he had ever seen who came up to his,
standard of female excellence. Even this seeming weakness he

ALL FOR THE BEST.

thought rather a virtue, as it betokened a depth and wealth of
affection not often met with. So he worshipped her in silence,
while she looked up to him as to one too wise to think of loving
a woman. She honored and reverenced him as she did her father,
though he was not ten years older than herself.
It was a bright Saturday in June just seven years since she
had parted with Juhian, and she had been busy all the morning,
with Mr. Goodwin's assistance, in trimming some vines. When
she had gotten through with it all, she threw herself upon the
grass under the spreading oak, and exclaimed, " That was indeed
a tiresome undertaking. I don't think I could ever have suc-
ceeded without your assistance. Indeed, Mr. Goodwin, I shall
miss you sadly during your vacation. Why must you go away
off to the mountains? Why not stay here with us ?" She looked
up at him as she spoke, and was surprised to see the change that
had come over his immobile features. A hot flush suffused his
face, and a passionate longing shone in his dark grey eyes as they
met hers. Then he dropped on his knees before her and said,
"If I might stay with you always, dear Miss Lula, or take you
with me! 0, if I only dared to tell you how very, very lonely
every place will be without you. May I say I love you-love you
with all my manhood's devotion? I know I am presumptuous
in telling you this when so many wealthy apd noble suitors have
been rejected. But, 0, do not weep ! Have I wounded you,dear
friend ? :Pardon me, I should  have been more guarded."
She was weeping bitterly. Soon she raised her weeping eyes to
his face and replied, "I did not think of the possibility of yors
caring for me. I do not call it presumption. Indeed I am honored
in being the object of such affection as yours. I honor you more
than I have ever done any man I have met with ; and I feel that
I would like to place my hand in yours and say, take me, lead me
where you will, I shall go ! I could trust myself with you, with
more perfect confidence than with any person I ever saw, but
there is a dream of the past, of my early girlhood, which haunts
me still. It is very foolish, I know, but I feel that I would be
doing you an injustice were I to go to you with only half a
heart."
He looked at her with pity and tenderness, as he took her hand

and said, "I have heard the story of your early love, and thought
that one who could be so faithful to an unworthy love, would be
a treasure indeed to one whose every aim in life would be to make
her happy. Half of your heart is worth more than the whole of
sonie women's. I have known you for two years, and have
watched you narrowly. In all that time I have seen no unworthy
action, have heard no unworthy thought uttered by you. I was
deceived in my youth, by one as fair as an angel of light. I have.
never thought I could love another. I was poor, and she left me
for a wealthy suitor. I have never thought I could love another,
until I saw you, and noticed you for months. I find my love for
my deceiver was a boyish fancy, but this is love of my manhood.
I am not rich now, but am independent. I believe you are sincere
in what you tell me, and I am willing to take your respect and
esteem, feeling sure that my great love will lead you to love me
in return. But I will-not press you for an answer. Only tell me
that you. will try to think favorably of my suit, and I can wait."
"I will try," she replied, " but do not cease to be my friend under
any circumstances." They walked into the house together, and
talked together as usual. This was a revelation soAnew to her,
she had become accustomed to the thought of being more to Mr."
Goodwin than a mere friend. She found herself drawing a com-
parison between Richard Goodwin and Julian Montgomery, and
it ended in the favor of the former. But Julian may have grown
more manly, and if she should see him would not the old love arise,
and make her miserable ? She had long .ago decided that she could
never wed him,.should he return. She was afraid to trust him;
yet she might not be able to cast him off without a severe pang.
Another week passed and Mr. Goodwin's school duties were
ended for the summer. In two days he expected to leave for a
visit to his relatives in a distant,11tate, and a short stay among the
mountains. He was coming on the morrow to bid his friends at
the farm-house farewell.
Lula was invited to spend the evening with a young friend in
the neighborhood and went, expecting to meet no one but the
family. What was her surprise when told that a gentleman was
stopping with them for a few days and was anxious to meet her.
When she entered the parlor, a tall, portly gentleman arose and

came to her, and she was surprised when he presented his hand.
She drew back and looked to her friend to introduce her, when
he said, ".Lula, can you have so entirely forgotten me?" The
voice was not forgotten, and she looked up into his face to see
the eyes, or something resembling the eyes, of Julian Montgomery
looking down upon her. She said, "You are very much changed,
but I believe I recognise Mr. Montgomery." She did not take the
hand he proffered. One look into his bloated face and red eyes
showed too conclusively that he was not the idol of her worship
that had fallen, and she now saw, was crushed utterly, hopelessly
shattered. As she sat and listened to his conversation, and noted
the ravages of dissipation so visible in his whole personnel, the
time passed very slowly, and she was rejoiced when the hour
came for her return home. The house was within a half mile of
her father's, and she preferred to walk it, and had sent the servant
who had accompanied her home before she entered the house, as
the young ladies of the house proposed to walk with her. She re-
gretted this very much when she found that Julian was prepared
to walk with her. She did not doubt that this was a plan to give
him an opportunity to speak with her alone. After they had
walked a little way the ladies fell back and left those two in front.
He commenced and told her of his terrible disappointment
when she gave him up for her father's whim. He did not believe
she would marry him, and his friends were anxious for him to
marry the lady he had called his wife. That he regretted the step
as soon as it was taken, and had never ceased to love her. He was
free now, and had come to offer her his hand and fortune. His
future life should be devoted to her. He felt highly flattered to
think she had remained single on his account. "Please do not
go any farther, Mr. Montgomery. If I have permitted a foolish
fancy to prevent me from accepting a much more worthy love,
that fancy is at an end. The dream has been dispelled. Pray do
not lay that flattering unction to your soul. You are not the man
my childish fancy painted. I needed but this short interview to
prove to me how very blind I was, and how keen was my honored
father's perception of character. His 'whim' has been a bless-
ing to his grateful child. I am sorry you should have troubled
yourself to come so far to undeceive me ; but am sorry on your

standing alone. When she reached the house, she went to her
father's room and told him all, and thanked him for saving her
from such a man. Then she -told him of Mr. Goodwiin's love, and
he was pleased and told her she was honored in the possessor. of
such a treasure. " I'know ,and feel it now, father."
The next day, when Mr. Goodwin asked Lula to.think of him
while absent as her truest friend, she replied, 4 I will, and as more
than that, if you wish it still." He looked down into her truthful
blue eyes, then caught her to his heart, as he whispered, " Am I
all to you, Lula, as you are to me? Have you seen him, and is
the dream broken ?" "I have seen him, Richard, and the only
wonder is that I ever fancied him. As with you, that was a
childish fancy : here lean rest with trust for all time."
When the autumn winds were turning the forests brown there
was a wedding, where the happy couple-the admired of all, and
the envied of many, were. Richard Goodwin an Lula Harper,
who had found the second love the truest and the best.

"No, sir, I will not he a party to any such outrage, for outrage
I must consider it. What other name can be given to such a
transaction ? Here I must marry a certain young lady whom I
have never seen, or lose my inheritance. I may not like her, and
she may not like me. I ar sure I would not wed her to save my
father's estate, neither would I be willing to accept her were
she willing to wed me for the sake of that estate. Give it to her

Ed ward Earle had been at a German university for four years,
since which time he had been travelling for pleasure as well as for
instruction. Medicine was his chosen profession, and he gave his
attention to it at alUl times. The summons home to take charge
of his father's estate, had found him amid the wild and picturesque
scenery of the Alps. Grifkor a father dearly loved left him no
desire to remain longer with his .companions in travel, and he
hastened home, to find, upon reaching the city near his home,
that a will was made leaving him the whole of his immense
wealth upon condition that he was to wed Alice Wolverton, as e
promise had been made her father, when she and Edward were
children, that they should be united when she was twenty-one
and he twenty-five. Her father had died about the time Edward
went to Europe, and Mr. Earle- had taken her to his house and.
employed teachers, so that she mightabe with him all the time.
Mr. Earle had been a widower since Edward's birth, with no
female relative to take the place of mother to the little boy. A
competent housekeeper superintended his household affairs, and
the little Edward learned to love her dearly. When informed that
his father had taken the daughter of an old friend, he was pleased
at the prospect of his father's loneliness being relieved by a sweet

parents, and always thought of her as a child who would brighten
his home when he returned,. His mortiflcation' and grief were
great, upon reaching the otTice of his father's executor, to find the
true state of affairs.
Mr. Wiseman tried to reconcile him to the provision of the
will, by dwelling upon the beauty, grace and acconiplislments of
the young lady, until finding it avaied nothing, he said: " Well,
it is just as well so. I suppose for the young lady has proven her
aversion to the proposed u nioh, in terms as strong and decided as
yon have done and in taking her self of to parts unknown. She
had a little money in bank which she drew out as soon as told of

her fair brow, and caught up with a comb, a stray curl escaping
froi'one side. He thought he must he (lead and had awakencd

his eyes.  he leanel for ward and said . " You are better; thank
God  " " Where am I?" he asked, and tried to rise, but found
.he was too weak for such an effort., 5he answered him: " You

-tor you know you must be very quiet, for yopiu have been very

inc and I think I can sleep." She took his hanl and said, as
gently as a mother would speak to her suffering child: "I will
not leave you; sleep now and you will be better when you wakee"
Ie did sleep, as peacefully as a child, and awoke refreshed and
strengthened.
Tihe days passed rapidly to our suffering hero until he was
strong enough'to sit iup. His nurse found time to stop beide his
easy-chair and speak a few words of encouragement as she flitted
about, waiting on the sick and wounded.
He did not think in those days; he knew that e'ery place was
dark without the light of'her presence, and he lived only when
he met those sympathetic eyes smiling uprn him, or moist with
the dew of pity when he was suffering.
As the weeks lengthened into months, and he knew that he
must leave Memphis, the thought of parting with his n'rse grew
painful, and he knew that he loved her onIV as he must love the
woman he asked to be his wife. At length he detained her, as
she passed him on one of her daily rounds, and retaining the hand
she had extended in her good-morning. saidL "Mss Cark, do

know nothing of you save that you are an angel, and I want you
to nurse me back to health and happiness, as only a beloved wife
can nurse her husband. Will you leave this place and go with
me as my bride, my own sweet Alice?"
She turned her head to look into the face upturned towards
her, and a flush stole over her fair face as she met those magnifi-
cent black eyes, so full of pleading tenderness. She did not speak;
but he must have fancied he saw his reply in her eyes, for his arm
stole around her, and the sweet face was drawn down to meet the
warm kisses which showered upon her cheeks and lips, as he mur-
mured, "My sweet Alice."
It was decided that he was to remain at the hotel a week until
she could find some one to take her place in the hospital as nurse,'
then she would wed him and go with him to his homle in Mary-
land. She said, before leaving him, "Dr. Early, I have something
to tell you before we go farther in our preparations. My name is.
not Miss Clark ; it is Alice Clark Wolverton. I took my mother's
maiden name, which is also my middle name, for a reason which
I think I ought to tell you."  She did not notice the quick start
he gave as she told her name, nor did she observe the peculiar
twinkle of his eyes, but proceeded to tell him, all the story of her
life. When she left Elmwood she had gone South, and found
employment as governess in a country family. Her home was a
pleasant one until the war broke out, and her employers were not
able to engage her for another term. She had tried to get another
situation and failed. She had gone to Memphis and obtained em-
ployment as assistant music-teacher in a school, which place she
kept until the battle in which he was wounded. Nurses were
sorely needed, and she had offered her services, little dreaming
she should meet her fate the very day of entering the hospital.
He looked up and said: "Alice, did it ever occur to you that
my name was not Early?" " 0, no, indeed it never did. Is not
that your name?" she asked with surprise. He smiled, and held
her close to him, as -he said: "You shall not escape Ime now,
much as I once wished it. Your revelation of your name and
history is a surpi-ise to me, but a very pleasant one; for know, my
darling, though you did not tell me the name of your foster-father,

I know it was Earle ; and don't run away, he was my natural
father, and I am Edward Earle, not Early."
She buried her face in her hands and burst into tears. He was
really distressed at her agitation, and said: "Is my name so very
hateful to you, sweet Alice? It is not my fault that you were de-
ceived. My soldier friends all called me Early, though I always
told my true name. I did not. think the slight difference worth
the trouble of an explanation until to-day. Don't weep, Alice,
you distress me. Do you hate me, when I love you so?" "Hate
you'? 0, no," she replied, " I love you very dearly, and I think I
can't help myself if I do marry yod, though I vowed never to like
you, or touch one cent of your father's property, just because he
wished to force us to love each other. I loved your father, Ed-
ward, and perhaps it is all right, and we' were made for each
other."
"I know it is all right, Alice. We were terribly rebellious
against our fate, but love each other too dearly now to find fault
with Providence."'
A week later the household of Elmwood were surprised to find
their beloved Miss Alice really their mistress, and a very happy
one, as happy as her lord. Though he walked on crutches for a
long while, he never regretted his hospital experience, and laugh-
ingly told his friends he was a married man' because'he couldn't
help himself.

ANNIE ARMISTEAD.
There was a sound of revelry by night,
*  *  *      And bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.
A thousand hearts beat happily, and when
Music arose with Its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes whicA spare again,
And all went merry as a marriage bell.",-Byron.
'Twas during the month of February, 1864, the troop of
cavalry from --  county, Virginia, was at home resting and re-
cruiting. The citizens gave them a dinner at the county seat, and
at night of the same day the troop gave a ball.
All of the friends of the soldiers were present, and a crowd
there was truly. Among the number present, who. seemed to
enter with peculiar zest into the amusements of the occasion, I
noticed Annie Armistead. Her beautiful black eyes sparkled with
mirth, her laugh rang out in ripples of joy, and her step seemed
peculiarly light and graceful as she moved through the dance.
She was quite a belle, and did not want for attention, and danced
all night with unabated zeal. She stood before me once during a
paus  inthe dance. As I arranged some portion of her dress
which was a little disordered, she stooped and kissed me, as she
sai "I feel so happy to-night.. I do not know why it is, but I
,haven't a care in the world."  I replied, "I am glad to see you
so happy, Annie. I can't understand though, how you can be so
free from care, with two brothers, and one still dearer than they, in
the army, exposed to danger all the w 'le." She smiled as she said,.
" They are safe ; I feel just as sure th t n harm will befall them
as I do that I am here to-night. That is w at makes me so light-
hearted. I know they will not be h rt,' and she moved off as
lightly and as gaily as a bird on the  g.
There were others present who seemed to enjoy the occasion,

ANNIE ARMISTEAD.

There were fair ladies and handsome, noble-looking me , men
who wore the Confederate grey with proud dignity ; yet ny eyes
followed that one girlish form, and a sigh of sadness would force
itself up from some unknown source as I witnessed her unusual
glow of happiness. I knew that she was a very affectionate
sister, and had grieved deeply for the brothers absent in the army.
I knew, too, that her whole heart was given to one worthy of her
guileless love, and that.he was an officer in 'that portion of Gen.
Lee's army which was always in danger ; for this reason her
present -exuberance of spirit was inexplicable to me, and I
watched her with anxious fear.
The months .passed by and still Annie Armistead was as gay
as a bird in the bright, beautiful spring days. Preparations were
going forward for a quiet bridal. Annie was an orphan, but she
had kind relatives who did all in their power to render her happy.
She wasnot naturally so gay, and her friends wondered at her
exuberance of spirits. Still they knew she loved devotedly, and
there was never a fonder sister. Strangers looked on and won-
dered if she loved Lieut. Harper; if so, why did she show such
reckless disregard to the fact that he was exposed to more immi-
nent peril than at any time during the three years of war.

CHAPTER II.
"There are thoughts of which I may not speak;
There are dreams that cannot die;
There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
And bring a pallor upon the cheek,
And a mist beforeuthe eye."-Longfelow.
The spring of 1864 was ushered in by the booming-of cannon,
and fearful reports of killed and wounded along the lines. The
story of that terrible succession of battles, of which that of the
Wilderness seemed the culmination of fierce valor and horrible
massacre, has been told in history, song and story. It is not my
purpose to go into any details of war records or party spirit ; I
am writing the simple story of a dear young friend.

ANNIE ARIISTEAD.

The first week in May was the time appointed for Annie Ar-
nistead's bridal. Lieut. Harper was to get a furlough for two
weeks and take his bride with him to Winchester, to visit some
rativ. How true it is that "man proposes but God disposes."
Thenight before the bridal eve a letter was received stating
that as action had commenced along the 'lines, and the, spring
campaign promised to be a bloody one, no furloughs could bo
granted just then, consequently the marriage must, necessarily,
be postponed. There was a startled, frightened look in her eyes
for afew moments, then Annie. said, "It is only a precautionary
mear   of Gen. Lee. There is no real danger. Lieut. Harper
will come sooner than you all expect him." Still she was restless
and uneasy.
A uneek passed, ind then came the news of the battle of the
Wilderness. First there were rumors of the killed and wounded.
Then'came a letter to Annie directed in a strange hand. She .
turned deadly pale as she caught it, and turned to a friend and
gasped, "Read it." It was written by a friend of her lover, one
whse name had been frequently mentioned'to her; and the in-
tlsencewas a crushing blow to her confident heart. Lieut.
Harper had fought bravely through the series of battles. On the
afternoon of the 11th he had been nearly surrounded by the
enemy, and had cut his way out, when he caught sight of her
brother, George Armistead, badly wounded and in' danger of
being trampled to death. He leaped from his horse to raise the
wounded boy and try to get him to a safer position, when. he was
observed by the enemy and fired at y two of their sharpshooters.
Their aim was too unerring, and oth he and the poor boy he
was trying to aid fell dead side by side. The letter was full of
s ypathy for the living and of loving regret for the dead; but it
f  upon unheeding ears. When Annie found that her lover and
brother were dead, a wild shriek rang out upon the air, and she
fell into a swoon from which, after hours of exertion on the part
of her friends' and a physician who had been summoned, she was
aroused, but not to consciousness. For three weeks she raved in
wild delirium; then she sank into a state of apathy which was
as distressing to her friends as her delirium had been. Her long
and glossy tresses had been cut close to her head ; and when,

months afterward, I met her, she was scarcely recognisable. Her
bright color had fled and given place to a ghastly pallor. Her
ey   hi had so sparkled with joy, had a wistful, far-off look
which was pitiful to behold, and there was a painful languor in
her movement as she walked about, as if she were forced to move.
Twelve months passed away ; the (var had ended and the sol-
diers returned to their poverty-stricken homes. Many thousands
of our bravest and dearest were left in soldiers' graves upon
strange soil. Lieut. Harper had been interred in Holywood Cem-
etery, in Richmond. His friend, Capt. Burton, wrote to Annie
that his remains had been taken to Holywood, and a slab bearing
his name, etc., had been placed a his head. She wrote a few  nes
of thanks, and set about trying to visit his grave. She went
with a friend to Richmond, and went to Holywood. They
walked about among the new-made graves of the soldiers until
she was worn down with fatigue, but could not find the name she
sought. There were so many soldiers buried there, and the stones
were so covered over with flowers, it was difficult for a stranger
to find any one he wanted. Annie was turning away with her
flowers just as the sun was sinking behind the western hills. Her
heart was very sad, 'and the tears gathered in her eyes, as she
stopped and cried, "0, can no one tell me where he lies ? "
There was a stranger leaning on a head-stone near by, who
stepped forward and lifted his hat as he asked:
"Can I be of any service to you, Madam ? I am well ac-
quainted here. Tell me whom you seek."
She raised her sad eyes to his. face and said: " Please tell me
where Lieut. Harper lies." He started violently, for he knew
this sad- but beautiful creature must be Annie Armistead. He
had heard so much of her from his friend that he felt sure he
would know her at sight, and though so changed, yet he felt she
was more interesting in her sorrow, more lovely, if possible, than
in her happiness.
He stepped back to the grave .he had been leaning on and
said, This ishis resting place -- the grave of the dearest friend I
had. Poor Herbert !"
Annie held out her hand to him and asked in that child-like
simplicity which so characterised her since his death, "Did you

upon the grave.
The sun had sunk beneath the horizon and the stars were,
Coming out, still she lay there moaning. Her friend tried to
ise her, but she refused to move. Marion Burton, for it was he,
the friend of her lover, raised her from the ground and said,
" Come, Miss Armistead, you must return to your home now. tI
am, Marion Burton, Herbert's friend. I will call for you to-
morrow and bring you here, when you can stay longer, and we
will plant 'a rose to bloom o'er his bed.' Tell me where you are
stopping, so that I may call." She could notespeak, but her
friend gave his name and the .name of his hotel. She followed
without resistance, and was placed in a carriage and borne of

of each day at the grave of her soldier lover. Marion
was with her every day. He felt strangely. drawn to this pale,
sad girl, so young to have her hopes so rudely blighted. The fact
that he was the friend of the one she loved made her yield to his
guidance and feel. that a tie of sympathy existed between them.
She would talk to. him more freely than to any other person.
He tried to convince her that it was sinful to resign herself so
wholly to this great sorrow ; that, for the sake of her friends it
was her duty to try to overcome it, and to take a greater interest
in life.

I need not linger over the events which followed the visit to

hope, from Captain Burton. For months Annie's replies were sad,
very sad, almost hopeless; yet they gradually became more cheer-

. It is a wise provision of nature that our extreme anguish will
wear out, and though the dead cannot be forgotten, new friend-
ships, even new loves, will spring up to fill the void in our hearts
and lives.'
When, twelve months after their meeting, Captain Burton
asked Annie to give herself to him, and permit him to shield her
from the rude blasts of adversity to which the war had reduced
her, he had come to the question so gradually, and so won upon
her confidence and affection by his sympathy and love for her
dead, she did not hesitate to yield her consent to his proposal.
She had not forgotten, nor could she ever forget, her dead love;
and she told him so ; but if lie was willing to take her as she was,
she would be a true and loving wife.
Two months later he came ; and when he returned to his home
in Winchester, Annie went with him, a quiet, but not unhappy
bride. His friends knew her history, and had pitied and loved her
before they saw her; now, she was welcomed by warm hearts, and
her husband's relatives and those ,of Lieut. Harper, who resided
in the same town, vied witheach other in trying to make her con-
tented and happy. Though she never was as gay as she had been,
yet her cheeks regained their bloom and her eyes their former
lustre, for she had everything to render her happy.
I wish I could leave her'here, happy in the love of her noble
husband and so many kind, friends, but truth compels me to go
on.
One year after her bridal as baby-boy was given to her keep-
ing. As the happy father took him in his arms for the first time,
he kissed the pale young mother; and asked : " Shall we call him
Herbert, darling?" -"0, no," she replied; "let him be named
Marion. Call him by his father's name."
She was cheerful, and all who saw her thought she was re-
markably well. At the expiration of two weeks she became rest-
less and feverish ; and in a -few hours was raving in delirium.
Her' husband was almost frantic witlh grief. The best medical
skill (he place afforded was called into requisition, but to no pur-
pose. ,Twenty-four .hours of intense agony and- wildest frenzy,
and the young mother sank into a stupor, from which her.physi-
cians said she would never arouse.

Just as the sun arose above the hills she opened her eyes and
smiled upon her husband, then closed them  again for a few
minutes. He caught her hand, and called her by the fond names
she loved so well;- but no response cam. Slowly she opened
her eyes once more, and with a bright smile she raised her hands
and cried, " Herbert, dear Herbert, I' come." Friends gathered
around, but she saw no one, heard no one. Her pure spirit htad
fled, and was wandering with the one she loved so fondly. The
bright, triumphant expression lingered until the body was low-
ered to its last resting-place.
She was followed to the grave by a large and sympathetic
crowd of friends, and the deeply bereaved husband and helpless
little babe were not forgotten. She was laid beside Lieut. Harper,
in Holywood, and a beautiful monument marks the spot. The
graves are decorated with fresh flowers every day, and the spot
where lie the youthful martyrs of the war is considered sacred
ground.

LOVE AND -HATE.
"Romeo! Rnomeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo ?"---shakspeare.
There was a sound, of revelry by night," which was not
disturbed by the clang and clamor of arms. The occasion was a
wedding party at the house of one of the wealthy farmers of the
Shenandoah Valley, to which were invited the youth and beauty
of the neighborhood. Among the young persons. present was
Charles Carrington, who had but recently returned from Europe
where he had been to complete his studies. He had just com-
pleted his twenty-fifth year, was- blessed by nature with a hand-
some face and figure, and a very fine intellect, which had been
improved and polished by seven years of study and travel in
foreign lands. He had a peculiarly distingue appearance which
rendered him perfectly irresistible to the ladies, who crowded
around to renew the acquaintance of their childhood. He was
the cynosure of all eyes. All, did I say? There was one excep-
tion, at least. There were some persons present who were entire
strangers to the distinguished traveller ; among that number were
the bride, and a young lady who sat with her delicately chiseled
features turned partly away from the group around him, and
conversing with the bride as easily as though there were no
"bright particular star " present. Near her were several gentle-
men who saw no face but hers. Her attitude was the personifica-
tion of grace, and her voice, so sweetly modulated, was music's
very self. - The approach of other persons toward her group
caused her to turn her head, and her eyes met the admiring glance
of the handsomest pair she thought she - had ever seen. - The
happy bridegroom had brought his friend for presentation to his
bride, after which ceremony Mr. Gilmore turned and said: " Miss
Erwin, permit me to present to you my friend, Mr.'Carrington.

Mr. Carrington, Miss Erwin." He took a chair in front of the
sofa occupied by the two ladies, and was soon engaged in an ani.
mated conversation. Though Miss Erwin'had never. travelled
outside of her own native country, she read many books of
travels, and really enjoyed comparing what she had read with the
descriptions Mr. Carrington gave her. From travels the transi-
tion to the literature of different nations was very natural, and
he found her familiar with his favorite German authors.
There were many friends who wished -to converse with him
that evening, and he was frequently interrupted, but would turn
again to his magnet, as truly as the needle to. the pole: The
evening came to an end, as all pleasures must. Not so the ac-
quaintance begun that evening. Minnie Erwin was a relative of
the bride, and remained with her two weeks, during which time
Charley Carrington came nearly every day to Mr. Gilmore's ;
sometimes with a new book, or a new German song which he
wished to sing with Miss Erwin, or to ask Miss Erwin to ride with
him. The days seemed winged Mercuries, so swiftly did they fly.
At length the time appointed for Minnie's return to her home,
which was only ten miles distant, arrived, and. in company with
her friends, the Gilmores, she returned to her father's house. Mr.
Carrington had- promised to call in a few days. Mr. Erwin had
been a widower for several years. His neighbors knew him as a
morose, unsocial man, while his servants looked upon him as a
stern but just master ; and his daughter, and only child, looked
up to him as to. a superior being, who rarely smiled,.but was
always kind and indulgent -to her. He had devoted a great por-
tion of his time to her education ; he was not satisfied that his
daughter should learn anything superficially. While he employed
teachers, he was not satisfied to trust them alone. He had been
a great traveller in his early manhood, and was master of several
foreign- tongues, which he taught his daughter in person. He
cared nothing for society, but permitted his daughter to visit, and
to encourage the visits of a select few.. -
Mr. Carrington did not delay his visit long. The next after-
noon saw him entering the tastefully decorated grounds of Mr.
Erwin, which gentleman he had never met. - River View, the
home -of the Erwins, was situated upon a hill overlooking the

most beautiful portion of that beautiful stream, the Shenandoah.
Nature, ever profuse in her loveliness, had done very much
for River View; while art, far from detract'  from her beauty,
had done much to aid her in making the ho 4e f man sufficiently
beautiful to be the abode of celestial beings. Surely, peace and
happiness ought to dwell there; and Charley Carrington almost
gave audible utterance to the thought then uppermost inhis mind :
"How beautiful! But not too lovely for the angel that dwells
here !"
Mr. Erwin was not in the house when Mr. Carrington arrived,
nor did he reach home until near nightfall. When he entered
the parlor, he found a stranger standing beside his daughter,
whose light fingers were producing sweetest music from the keys
of her piano. The look of admiration was unmistakable, and
the father stopped on the threshold to take a better'view-of this
man who might steal his daughter's heart from him. Surely
there was nothing to complain of in the aristocratic bearing, the
true nobility which shone in every lineament of his handsome
face, and the respectful adoration so plainly visible in his eyes. He
was drawn toward him irresistibly, and the momentary verdict
was a good one. Just then the music ceased, and he moved for-
ward, while Mr. Gilmore, who had been curiously observing his
movements, arose, and presented to him Mr. Carrington. As the
name was called, Mr. Erwin presented his hand with old Virginia
cordiality, but an indefinable something in the motion of his guest
made him start back and exclaim, " Carrington ? What Carring-
ton ?    My name is Charles Carrington, sir, son of Charles Car-
rington, of this county," replied" the young man.
A deathly pallor had overspread the old man's face as he spoke,
and he staggered and gasped for breath. His daughter placed an
easy-chair near him, and tried to seat him in it. He grasped the
back of it, and glared at his visitor, as he hissed, "' Young man,
did you come to beard the lion in his den? or did your father
never tell you how I hate the very sound of his name?"
Charley drew himself up and looked steadily into the old
man's eyes as he replied, "If my father has aught against you,
I have never heard him 'mention it. No, sir, my father never
speaks harshly of any one. When I told him of meeting Miss

Erwin at Mr. Gilmore's he merely replied,   I am glad you like
her, my son.'"  " Ha ! ha!" laughed Mr. Erwin. " Yes, I dare
say he is. Take yourself out of my house,'young man. You arc
like him, and her too. Don't cross my path again. No, sir, no, a
thousand times -no ! I would bury my child alive before she
should wed A son of Charles and Mary Carrington. Take your
hands off, young man. She has merely fainted. Go, and may. all
the demons of perdition follow eyerything.dear to Charles Car-
rington."
Charles had stooped to raise Minnie from the floor where she
had fallen, when-her father seized his arm and ordered him to go.
He lifted her and pressed one kiss upon her pale cheek, then
laid her upon the sofa, and with a face as pale as the one he had
kissed for the first and perhaps the last time, turned without a
word to any one, and left hope and happiness which but a few
moments before had seemed more of heaven than of earth.
We will leave him to mount his horse and gallop homeward in,
the moonlight, which he is too miserable to see is gloriously full
and silvery,'and follow Minnie Erwin.
Minnie's swoon was so death-like, Mr. and Mrs. Gilmore tried
in vain to restore her by means within their i'each. At length
Mrs. Gilmore turned to Mr. Erwin, who, still sat the. picture of
rage and blind fury, and said, " Uncle William, you have killed
your child."  He started suddenly and' looked at her. She
pointed to the sofa where Mr. Gilmore was still trying to bring back
life into that lovely frame. In a moment the father gained the
ascendancy over every other feeling, and he knelt beside her and
chafed-her hands, as he murmured," Who said I killed you, dar-
ling ? Minnie, love," look at me once more." Mr. Gilmore asked
if he had nothing in the house which could be used with effect.
A bottle of hartshorn was found, whose pungency restored res-
piration, and they had the satisfaction of seeing her open her*
eyes and look around.
Where is Charley? I thought he was here,"-she asked
faintly; then seeming to remember all, she threw her arms around
her father's neck and cried, " o, father ! 0, my father ! "
He laid her back on the sofa and said as gently as he could,

come between me and my hate. It was engendered years before
you were born. Time has failed to soften it. I have vowed
never to - forgive that man for crossing my path. I cannot go
into details now. It would. arouse the demon in me which you
are too feeble to see in all its hideous deformity. Nay, do not in-
terrupt me. I know what you would say. It is enough that he
is the son of my mortal enemy; and dearly as I love you, wil-
lingly as I would make any other sacrifice for. you, I would see
you die rather than see you his wife. Forget him. Let his name
never be called in my presence again. Should you see him or
have any communication with him in any way, I shall disown
you and never see your face again. I have long desired to take
you to Europe. Our late war prevented my doing so. Now we
will leave this place in a week. Any preparations you may need
can be made in New York, where we will stop for a while."
He turned and left the room. Mrs. Gilmore knelt beside her
weeping cousin and put her arms around her, as she begged her.
to be true to herself to resist such injustice. " We have enough
dear Minnie, and you shall share our home until Charley takes
you to his noble heart. If there were any reason for this strange
anger of Uncle William's I would be the last to counsel you in
this way; but Mr. Carrington has always borne a reputation
above reproach. I am sure he would not knowingly injure any
one; and Charley is a young man whom any one might be pleased
to, call his son. Go with us home, Minnie, and your father will
soon repent his harshness and come for you."
"Nettie," Minnie replied, "you are so happy just now, you
think I could be happy without my father's love. You counsel
me to disobey a parent who has never failed in his kindness to his
motherless girl, no matter what he may have been to others. No,
no, my cousin; from my heart I thank you and Mr. Gilmore for
your kindness, but must follow my father. Perhaps the day may
come when I may meet Charley. If he remains-true to me we
may yet be happy, though I see no light ahead just now. Tell
him to forget me andseek one whose hand can go with her love.
I cannot love another. The truth I plighted to him this after-
noon in the honeysuckle bower cannot be recalled. I shall not
marry, but I would not keep him bound. Tell him he is 'free.

This is the last time I must speak of him.. Tell him God only
knows how truly and entirely my poor, breaking heart is his.
I must not linger over details, or my story will be lengthened
out too much. I will hasten on.
Four years passed away, and it is 1September,.a1870 The Er-
wins, father and daughter, had returned to River view after
having njade the tour of Europe, visiting every place of note or
probable interest. Mr. Erwin was tired of travel,tand feeling
satisfied that the homage paid to his daughter's beauty and itel-
lect by the nobility of foreign lands had obliterated all traces of
Charley Carrington's image, he was content to settle down upon
his farm without a desire to wander further. Many rare articles
of beauty and utility were bought to decorate their home. The
grounds had been left in the care of an experienced florist, and
presented a handsome appearance upon their return.
Friends called, and the affairs of the neighborhood were dis-
cussed. Dr. Carrington was upon the tongues of all the young
ladies. He had settled in a village near by, and was practising
medicine with eminent success, endearing himself to all hearts by
his gentleness and kindness to the poor. Many wondered why
he did not marry. He certainly did not lack for opportuni-
ties to select a wife, for he had but to make his choice pnd te
bride would be ready. But, while he was polite to all, hehdnt
no preference for any lady. Two weeks passed, and he had not
seen Minnie since her return. He called ou Mrs. Gi  r,h but
she could tell him nothing, as Minnie would not talk about her-
self. .
The mild beauty of that September will long be remembeed
by many persons, whose Valley homes were so gloriously beautiful
before that terrible and ever memorable flood of the 29th and 30th
of September, 1870, burst in such wild and sudden fury upon them.
River View was on a cliff very near the river, sufficiently elevated
to be secure from any high water-far above any mark ever made.
by water.
Minnie Erwin sat in her chamber that evening, sad and silent.
In her morning ride she had met Dr. Carrington for the first time
in four years. Their eyes met for a minute, and she could not
forget their sad, reproachful expression as he bowed and passed

on. Must she go on thus-living where she might meet him
every time she ventured out, and never exchange a word with
him ? It was too much--much more than she could bear. Weari-
some as the gaieties of Paris had become the winter before, such
a life was preferable to the present one. She would tease her
father to take her to some Southern city to spend the winter
In her wretchedness she had not heard the roar of thunder and
rain, until her father called her. She opened the door, and he en-
tered, saying, "It is a fearful night, Minnie ; I have looked out
until my heart is sick. If I did not believe God's word to be true,
I should think this world would be destroyed by water again."
"Is the storm so fearful, father ? Is the river rising?" "Rising?,
Why, child! where have your thoughts been wandering? Look out
from the window and see the destruction going on. Houses are
being swept past with -railroad speed'; cattle and horses are
whirled past us, pitifully appealing to us for assistance. Trees
are torn up by the roots and borne off, together with bridges,
mills, and all of the farmers' crops. Look, child! Q, my God!
there goes a house with a woman and children screaming for help.
I can't bear the sight,"' and he sat down and covered his face with
his hands. There was a strange fascination in the war of elements
to Minnie. Like a bird charmed by a serpent, she felt all the
horrors of the night, yet-could not move from the window. The
servants came to tell. her the water was rising in the basement.
She merely said, "Take what you can out," and kept her eyes on
the river. "Father," she said, "the water does not rise up, it
leaps two or three feet at, a time. It is above the cliff, and up to
the front steps. The flood-gates of heaven must be opened. Do
you think we are in danger?" "No, child, I hope not. Leave
the window, Minnie, and come here. I must talk to you some, to-
night; sit here beside me. It is a fearful night, and something
urges me to tell you the story of my hate. This house is too
firmly built to be in danger. - If the water should rise to the second
floor, it cannot move. You think me very harsh, and I look back
upon my past life and see that I have been, not only harsh, but
unjust. Let me begin at the first. I was an only child, but I had
a cousin, Mary Morrison, who was five years younger than myself.
She was an orphan niece of my mother, a perfect little fairy, who
soon became the light of our household.

"I was always disposed to rule, to be the tyrant; and while
Mary loved me as a brother, she was afraid of me. In childhood
I enjoyed having her yield her wishes to mine through fear ; but
as I grew up to manhood, and noted her beauty and sweetness of
disposition, I wanted to win her affections, and did all that I could
to accomplish that object. It was a settled thing with my parents
that we should be married when she was eighteen. Well do I
remember my twenty-first birthday. My college course was com-
pleted, and a classmate whom I loved dearly had come to spend
several days with me in hunting and fishing. He had visited me
before, and I loved him as much as a selfish, exacting nature like
mine could love a brother. But this day of all days !- I had never
asked Mary to be my wife. I felt sure she would not refuse me
after knowing my parents' wishes, and I-had determined to know,
from her own lips, my destiny. She had presented me with a
very handsome pair of embroidered slippers, with a card in one
upon which was written, 'To my dear brother William, from his
sister Mary.'- I did not like her calling me brother. She. had
never done so before, and I went in search of her to tell her the
dearest gift I could claim from her hands was her priceless love,
and nothing less would satisfy me. I found her, but, 0, misery !
I found her with the arm of my friend encircling her lovely form,
and heard her say to him, 'I have never loved any but you.
Cousin William seems too much like a brother, I could not think
of wedding him.' I was a madman then, darling. I called my
friend a deceiver, a villain, everything, and struck at him in my
blind fury. Mary sprang between us, and the blow felled her to
the earth. I remember nothing more of what occurred, for a
blow'from Charles Carrington's fist laid me low. When. I re-
turned to consciousness, I was alone. I went to the house and
shocked my poor mother by my wicked oaths of vengeance. -I
called for Mary and would have cursed her, but my father, whose
will I dared not disobey, forbade my seeing her until I could com-
mand my temper. The excitement, together with the blow, caused
her to have a long spell of brain fever. When she recovered, my
mother took her to Charlottesville, and remained there with her
several weeks. During her stay I wrote to her and asked pardon
of her for causing her pain, but vowed never to speak to or

think kindly of Charles Carrington again. I adjured her by all
our childhood, by what my parents had done for her, not to
marry my enemy, but to return prepared to make my life happy
by her love.; and wound up by telling her if she refused the offer I
made her, we could never live under the same roof-- no, not one
day. Her reply came. It was full of excuses for her lover ; he
had never known of my love for her, as I knew I never had a
confidant, and did not talk of myself to my most intimate
friends. She had not dreamed of any other than a cousinly affec-
tion until my mother had told her the day preceding my birthday,
and that was why she called me brother, to check any other feel-
ing, as her heart had long been given to another. It was a sweet
kind letter, and any one but a madman must have pitied the poor
creature. I knew she told the truth, yet I cursed her, and impi-
ously prayed that the curses of heaven might fall upon her and
her chosen. She did not return with my mother, for Charles
Carrington married her in Charlottesville and took her home.
Charley was a noble man, handsome as Apollo, or as his son,
which you may doubt. I have been very harsh and cruel, but to-
night, as I look out upon the terrible tempest, I see how impotent
is man's wrath, and I believe I can forgive Charley Carrington
and his wife."
Minnie sat weeping, too absorbed in the story to heed the war
of elements without. She felt that the mansion was secure, and
feared nothing for her father and herself. She .little knew her
peril, until a rap at the back door, a rap loudand emphatic,
startled her and she ran to see its cause. When the door was
opened, she was'astonished to see a man on horseback, and to hear
herself addressed hastily. "Minnie, Miss Erwin, for God's sake
save yourself. Where is your father? Be quick, for the out-
houses'are being swept away, and the water is above my horse's
knees in the back-yard. I have your riding horse here, but no
saddle except mine. Throw something around you quickly; I
can't assist you, as the horses will not stand in this storm alone."
Mr. Erwin had come forward, and hastily-throwing on his ploak
while Minnie wrapped a large shawl around her, hastened to the
door, and they were assisted to mount, Minnie behind her father
on Dr. Carrington's horse, while he rode hers without a saddle.

The water was rising rapidly, and before they reached higher
ground, had wetted their feet. The servants had left the house
without ceremony, some time before. They rode to a neighbor's
house a half mile distant, and found shelter and safety from the
Y &amp;            storm.
When daylight dawned, nothing was 'left of River View NtL
a large hole in the washed-out hill-side where it had stood.
4   i              Desolation reigned supreme. Whole families were left without
shelter and food and w ithout a change of clothing.
Mr. Erwin was too thankful for his escape fronr certain death
to feel farther anger. When he and his daughter had been saved,
and their kind friend saw they needed no farther assistance from
him, he started out to try to aid some others who might be in
deadly peril. Mr. Erwin grasped him by the arm and said,
TYoung man, yon have saved my life, and that of one dearer to
me than my own. I feel to-nigl.t that I lve been very wicked,
and I ask von to forgive the har hness of a former meeting. Can
you forget the past? I had just told my daughter all the fearful
story of my wickedness and sin toward your parents. You are
going to risk your life to save others. Let us part as friends; and
if von live, let us meet again as friends." Charley turned and
grasped the hand extended toward him.. He looked at Minnie,
who stood trembling near them. Her father held out his hand,
and she placed hers in it; he then placed it within that of Dr.
Carrington, whose warm clasp closed over it, and he bent his
proud head and kissed her brow, as he said: "After all these
years of trial! Thank God ! for giving you to me to-night. But
I must go, do not be uneasy; life is sweet to me now," and he
galloped off to seek new sufferers. There was much to tell when
Dr. Carrington returned, but the cup of joy was full when,, a few
days later, Mr. and Mrs. Carrington 'came, and would have them
to remain with them, in their pleasant home, until a new home
could be found. Then Mary Carrington proved a sister indeed,
and, to the motherless one, a mother in love and sympathy. Thbe old
friends, so long separated by hate, were more firmly united than
ever. The love of their children was a new bond between them.
Mr. Erwin told them of his pure young wife who was chilled to
death by his coldness, and wl q~m he- never learned to love until

FEMALE SUF FR A GUE.
I feel quite sure of the fact that such a .subject would udt e
seriously discussed by the gentlemen of this order-loving commu-
nity; but, lest their debate should lead some of the softer sex to
think such a thing a "'consunmmation devoutly to be wished "
I am constrained to give them a few of my thoughts upon the
subject. I believe that all true Southern ladies will unite with
me in a protest against the agitation of such a subject.
I feel no hesitancy in saying that woin'riis not man's equal
mentally. I am not ashamed to acknowledge i y inferiority, nor
do I think it any disparagement to our sex. We have separate
and distinct spheres of usefulness, and if we fill those spheres as
we should, there will be no jealousies arising from conflicting pur-
suits. Nature has denied her the physical power necessary for a
rivalry with man in the ordinary pursuits of life. I hold the
opinion that a woman has the right to make a living for herself
and those dependent on her, in any honest way. If she'has no
one to provide for her, and Providence seems to design her for a
position usually filled by a man, let her not shrink from her duty.
Woman was made as a helpmeet for man. Had God intended
her to be his equal in every particular, he would have made her
as he did man, " of the earth, earthy." As it was, she was taken
from his side, that she might be ever near his heart; from under
his arm, that he might shield and protect her by his superior
strength.
What was Mrs. Adam's occupation in the garden of Eden?
Was it to.entertain her angel visitors with complaints that her
lord did not accord to her equal rights? (Perhaps it had been
better for us all had she been permitted to have fewer privileges.)

Let us see what Milton says she was doing when Adam was ex-
pecting an angelic visitor.
"And Eve within, due at her hour, prepared
For'inner savory fruits of tastg to please
True appetite.
To whom thus Adam called:
Haste hither, Eve, and, worth thy sight, behold
Eastward, among those trees, what glorious shape
Comes this way moving. * *  * *
But go with speed.
And,.what thy stores contain, bring forth
Abundance, fit to honor and receive
Our heavenly visitor."'
This was anterior to the mighty fall, therefore her housekeep-
ing was not enjoined as-a punishment, but' must have been the
part assigned hey by her Creator, and she very evidently consid-
ered it a labor of love until, the arch-enemy of human happiness
tempted her, as he has been doing ever since, to try to become
even the equal of.God.
Fannie Fern says that men are precious fools sometimes
(pardon me for jumping from Milton to Fannie Fern), but I thin
the serpent must have been very subtle indeed to know so well
that his surest way of success lay in attacking the weaker vessel,
I do not believe he could have beguiled man in any other form
than that of woman. St. Paul tells us that the husband is the
head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, and the
wife should see that she reverence her husband. Now, how is it
possible for us to reverence our equals? True, we would scorn
the idea of being the equals of some we have seen who call them-
selves men; but we mean men such as God made them. I believe
it is generally accorded to us that our intuitions are more gener-
ally correct than those of man ;-still we do not reason as man
does. We are too prone to jump at conclusions, and take our
first impulses for our 'guide or rule of action. I do not believe
we could be strictly just as jurors or judges. .Our hearts are too
tender for that, and our prejudices too strong. We do-not yield
to man any superiority wiithin our sphere, and we look down
with sovereign contempt upon such as would .contest our rights
within that sphere. A woman who attempts to place herself upon

an equal footing with man is an object of ridicule; btt a tman
who stoops to our peculiar sphere is too contemptil)ie for even
pity.  We know full well, 0 man, our- weakness and your
strength, and are not willing to enter the political arena with you.
Our rights are too holy to be mixed up with anything so debas-
ing as politics. In all civilised countries man has placed us upon
a lofty throne, the highest place in his affections. Let us be con-
tent to be "the power behind the throne." Love and sympathy
constitute our atmosphere, and we cannot breathe healthfully in
any other.
The voice of fame is sweet, very sweet, but it cannot satisfy
the cravings of a woman's heart. The poetess may revel amid
the delights of fairy land,1may explore the fairfields of imagina-
tion, and drink intoxicating draughts from the fount of Castalia.
She may think she is happy while in the solitude of her chamber
she pores over, Spenser, Milton, Shakspeare, &amp;c., &amp;c. She may
follow Lalla Rookh in her travels through the Happy Valley, sit
beside Ellen Douglas as she rows her light skiff over the beautiful
lake, or roam with Shelley through the weird but fascinati g field
of fancy ; but without congenial companionship, all this leasure
palls upon her senses, and a raven is ever croaking hoarsely at
her door "Nevermore," until heartsick and weary she prays to
die.
There may be a stern satisfaction in some women in being
able to tear the tendrils of their hearts away from all support,'
and let them trail in the dust or snap them ruthlessly asunder,
until they become seared and hard as adamant. Do what we will
and seem what we may, there are hours when even the breath of
fame seems a sirocco to burn up heart and brain, and we cry out
in bitteianguish for a little spot somewhere in this wide world to
call our home, for a strong arm to lean upon, and a noble heart
to love us above all the world. What were literary or political'.
honors to a heart starving for affection ?
Let politics alone, my sisters. Improve your minds so as to
be ple sant companions..for your gentleman friends. Let your
modesty, intelligence, and affectionate reverence be the magnet
which is to draw your husbands and brothers from all places of
vice to a miniature paradise, a home such as nature and inspira-
tion teach us we were made to create for our masters.

St. Paul tells us" (and he is very good authority, I think,) that
it is a shame for a woman to speak in church. What would he
have said had he heard of such a thing as a " Womrjan's Rights
Convention "? Is it not much more a shame for a woman to
harangue an audience upon political subjects ? I consider it a
very doubtful honor for a man to be made the equal of a negro;
but, from elbowing our way through a crowd of negroes and
vulgar white men to the polls, " angels and ministers of grace de-
fend us!"
To the gentlemen who advocate our political equality, I say,
beware what-you do. You, surely, do not know the extent of our
ambition; when once aroused, it is as boundless as the universe,
and like the mountain torrent, sweeps everything before it. We
will not be content with any half-way privileges. Give us the
right to vote, and we claim the right to hold office, also to elec-
tioneer, to frequent court-houses and bar-rooms, and treat, which
seems such a delectable privilege to our male friends; to keep our
riding horses, and have our law and medical offices; and, as our
sex has the majority, besides those of the gentlemen who could
not vote against " a lady," we are sure to get all the best offices,
while the men will be forced to our many expedients to make a
living. Should our very wise handling of the reins of govern-
nent bring on civil or foreign wars, we claim the privilege to
fight, bleed and die for our country. Of course, as in civil affairs,
we expect to have the fat offices. We will be quarter-mistresses,
commissaries, surgeons and chaplains. Some of us will be field
officers, while our poor husbands or lovers must shoulder their
muskets, or perhaps be detailed as our servants to clean our
boots, and keep our horses and arms in order. Some one might
ask what is to become of home, the chickens, &amp;c. 0, that-camfbe
easily arranged. We can get some maiden sister or aunt or
grandmother, who is muster free, to take our places; or, may be
those of the lords of creation who claim exemption from military
duty can be hired as substitutes to stay at home. 0, won't that be
a delightful time!  ware, I say, gentlemen ; we might become
so contaminated as to learn to swear and chew tobacco !
