'6           3ONATHAN OLDI3UOK

Mt Ol4buok was a man of about forty-nine years of age, btxt who
'wished he was only thirty, and trie&amp; all in his power to make him.
-eelf appear so. He was not a good..loeking man by any means, his
figure was about the riddle size, and as he was beginning to grow
-stout, he buttoned his coat closely to make him look as thin as
possible. He was not handsome, for his eyes were of a greyish hue,
the balls rather bloodshot, and the eyelashes from age almost the
-color of the 'eyes~ But 'Jonuithan Oldbnck wore spectacles, and he
scarcely ever took them off, his nose was very flat, his chin rather
rourfd, and his mouth large, but Mr. Oldbuck Would now and then
put on a rather agreeable expression, for a smile would come to his
aid, and when a man smiles, he always looks pleasant. In fine, ho
was a man, who was very careful in his dress, an~ if ho had a little
better head of hair, would have passed amongst the crowd, but he
was bald on the summit, and as men generally look up to the fore~
head, he carefully tried to conceal the defect, by bringing his hair
from the back of' his head to the front and performing the same
- operation with that above his ears. Withal, it could only be said,
that he had a very prominent forehead, and it was questionable,
whether he should have worn a wig or not. You will see from this,
'that Mr Oldbuek was a man who had every desire to please; he
possessed a very sensible heart, for he adored the fair sex, and love
was the principal occupation of his life.
There are' indeed very few persons, who have not experienced this
feeling at some time or other, or who have not devoted a little of
their ipisure to, dalliance with the ladies, for as Voltaire says#." we
'must love, it is that which sustains u~, and without loving, sad
'~wo~uld be' the fate of man."
Jonathan Oldbuck had, however, from his youthful years, carried
"the thins to an excess. ]~ven in his childhood, he had given proofs
of much tend'erz~ess; he loved birds, petted cats, and cried eight days,
~be~Oausa his ~favorite dog left, him. Then, when he reached the years
of adles~e~ioe, he contracted a tender attachment for a fat Irish girl,
'who pi~esid:ed over the kitchen in his father's establishment. Young
"Oldbuck was always in 'the kitoheii; he learnt his lessons there, and
4ried to toacl!~ Meggy the cook, the rudiments of Latin.
Whilst Maggy was plucking a pigeon, or seasoning the spinage,
Little Jonathan would look at her in the face, and say
'~'4mo tib4 Maggy. Will you conjugate the verb emare, with
me?"
* "Let me alone, Master Jonathan, what do I know about Latin;
speak in~ pure Inglisli, I tell ye, and don't bother me with what I
~don't understand."
"No, no, Maggy; I want to tell you in Latin, that I love you,
"Let ~ne alone, sir, or you will make me spoil my sauce."
"I'll net prevent you, Maggy, mulier mulieris."

'lN~8EARCH'OF'A WIFE.
'"What is that you' oafl rue, Master Jon~tha'n, 'a t~ule V 'I'm~
sure I'm adacent Christian woman, and ['11 tell your.father, sir, if
you call me 'a mule,' again !"
"Never mind, Maggy, you are a woman; I love you, and I only
wish to tell you so in Latin."
"Oh ! my spinage is too salty, let inc alone; sir, I tell you."
"'Say then with me, Amo tild, and I will kiss you if you do."
"And shure, is it about kissing ye spake, ye little fellow? why'
ye are hardly big enough to leave your mother's apron strings. Let
me alone, I tell you !"
"Maggy, Formosum pastor Gorydon ardebat A1ext~a," and he-
bellowed the words out, so that Maggy could not help hearing him.
"I don't knoW those people, said Maggy, but I'll tell your father'
of your behaviour, Sir."
And little Jonathan went out of ~he kitchen, after giving a~
striking indication of the amatory disposition of his youth, which
augured well for the mature development of his manhood.
When the dinner hour had arrived and they were all seated at~'
the table, Maggy brought in the pigeons and the spinage, but the
former. was burnt, and the latter was so salty, that they couldn't
eat it, and they scolded her well for her carelessness.
"It's your son's fault, sir; he's always poking himself in the
kitchen and is constantly behind my back. He wanted to teach me-
Latin and talked about kissing. I told hirri to go away and he'
wouldn't."
The father scowled at his boy, and told Maggy to hold her tongue~
She pouted as she left the room, and the thing passed over.
Jonathan Oldbuck senior was a native of New Bedford, ana a~
whaler by trade. He had made many voyages to the Pacific and been'
successful in business. His conversation was generally engrossed
with the perils and dangers of the deep, and he took great pleasure
in descanting on the incidents of whale fishing. He passed hours"
together in explaining how they separated the oil from the blubber,~.
and at last ~his Aconversatioll partook of the terms peculiar to his.
employment, and when anything did not please him, or he did not-
rightly understand it, he was in the habit of saying, "it's aW
blubber."
It is surprising how a father's peculiarities will descend to the
son, and how much he partakes of the nature and character of his -
disposition. JonathanQOldbuck junior showed this in after life, for'
when anything extraordinary occurred, or he could not well account:
for it, he used his father's expression, and distinguished the shadow"
from th~ substance.
His father died before he had reached the age of manhood, leaving
)xim, his only son, under the charge of his mother, who devoted her:
maternal cares towards the development of th~ hopeful youth.'
Jonathan Oldbuck junior had, as we have before said, furnishoJ~'

It is rather disagreeable to receivee such letters, particularly when
~ person begins to labor under the impression that his loves returned,
s&amp;~OIdbuck flew into a rage, crumpled the note in his hands, and
mnrmuro4 'a~ follows,: "She did well enough to write me as much,
'I 'never'lo~red her, I couldn't' bear hei~, 12 intended telling her so to-
morrow.~ The nasty,, impudent creature, and to write about 'the'
furnished house too, as if IL could'nt buy her what she wanted, a~
ho~iee, 'furniture, and e~e~ything. But my mother always told me
women .weie sordid, and unless I inspired passion, never to marry.
A~if ~yi~art~mia:s ~iiot alone sensible 'to love, and that I should ex-
pect 'to find ~the"same in' the woinan I would make my wife. FaitW
'less Amelia ~ll I hope is, that thorns may beset your path, and that
y~ii may never' lie on a bed' bf 'roses."
It Was in the afternoon of the same day' he received this 'letter,
that 'he entered the rest&amp;urant, iii which we llrst introduced him to
our readers, ahd of course his temperwas 'rather sourOd 'from having'
r~eived such ~m epistle. '
~fle looked around' and saw 'a rnotleyv group 'seated at the tables. lie
w~ inclined 'to judge rather severely of the characters of the' people.
whW were, ~seeknbled there, and' when he returned home, he told his
rrrMher what his thbughts~were on the subject.
'He said he saw a pale-faced young man, who ate 'so ravenously,
that he thought he had not partaken of ~Tood for a week; he had'
a ~iVnken eye, 'distended' nostrils and his whois features indicated that
he~'Mra~ bb1d~ring on' starvation. He fancied he was a writer,' far'
hishat was filled with papers, which were covered with writing, and
as~don~ as he eat his dinner, he hurriedly took his departure.: "Poor~
feW~w," said Jonathan to his mother, "if I thought he was in want,
I would wil#ngly give him assistance. I dare say he w~s some poor
forh~rra author, wh&amp;wcaried his brains to furnish manuscripts for the
p~lilishers, and who, as it very often happens, gets his labor for 'his
palii~.          '                                    '    '
"There was a~iother, whose sharpbpointed features and peering eye~'
indicated' that'he belonged to a class, who were in the habit of prey.~
ingon mankind. They are called' lawyers; but as you know, father,
whu wasaIways fond ~of usiOg terms wl~ich he learnt at sea, used to
calI:therri sharks, a kind' of fish t~iat preyed on all others,' and whou~'
they were caught, were found to be so fat, that' they almost IflIrSt
from repletion.
#" It dl4'ixt"soexi~' to be the case with him, for ~it I could judge froriL
the spare meal he made, he had not' much shot in his looker,' asfar.~

IN S~ARCII OF A WlF~
thor used to say; I could swear he was a lawyer, for there was a grot
~1eal of cunning in his eyes, and he seemed to me as if he could pee
~hrongh a stone wall. He was cute enough, as we say down east,
and if I had a case in court, I would willingly.give it to him.
"There was a plough.boy, too, he eat, oh my, how he did eat! He
'eras so fat, that he weighed more than the two others put together.
was evident, that he had been brought np in the country, and did
ui$ wear out his mind and body by toiling in a garret or working at
court. Farmers are, after all, happier than lawyers and authors
p~t together. They sow and reap harvests, whilst lawyers some~
ti4ues reap them, without being put to the trouble of sowing, and,
as for authors, I'm told, they neither sow nor reap, and are generally
so poor and needy that they can be distinguished by their worn-out
hat and thread-hare garments."
'~Jonathan, my boy, when are you going to marry ?"
'~1Earriage again, mother!" and he took a candle and went to bed

could not be mistaken for dimples, but which, in the shade, looked
as if they had been the victims of the smallpox. Martha, Jane,
and Eliza, were bordering on that age, when ladies are looking out
earnestly for beaux, and were beginning to express their surprise
that men were insensible to their charms. Louisa; the youngest,
had the family features, and no one could mistake her for a Switzer,
but' 'she was young, and youth adds charms to females generally.
Besides, she was the only one in the family who could play on the
piano, and whert she sang, all eyes were turned to her, admiring the
melody of her voice, and the brilliance of her execution.
The house was not furnished very fashionably, for the father had
bought secondhand furniture, and the plush-covered seat~, which
were once scarlet, had become so dirty from use, that you could not
well distinguish the color. The tables were of mahogany,' but of a
light color, and were so much scratched by the children 'w~hen they'
Were young, that the varnish was iii many places almost e*itirely off'

JONATHAN OLDEUCK
th~w~ather duly descanted upor~, there was a dead silence, for none
seemed to be overburdened with the materials for conversation.
~!rSwit~e~ beckoned to his wife to go in to supper, and she in
turz~ beokone~ to her daughters. Mr Oldbuok could not do otherE
wisetlian, offerjus arm to Miss Louisa, and the procession being
formed~ the mother followed up the rear with a smirk on her oounte~
nance, as if all h~r projects had already become matured.
~Phe party was seated at the tea table, where Miss Louisa did th'e
honors with a grace, which must have been as pleasing to her
mother as her admirer. Neither Martha, Jane, or Eliza, opened
their lips, during the greater part of the time they were at table,
and' all seemed to be intent on the few words that escaped from their
guQst.
~Ie first spoke about the theatres, then the Museum, then about
the play, that was performed there, "The Serious. Family," Mr~
Aminadab Sleek, and all the rest of the peculiar characters, with
whioli it abounded~ $e finally wound up,, by giving a general in-
vi~ition to the whole family to visit the Museum with him on the
following evening.
"You are too good," said the mother.
5' )1~eall.y, I shoxdd be delighted,~' said Martha, and there was a
general titter throughout the company, which betokened their ad~.
miration of Mr Oldbuok's generosity, and. the pleasure they should~
de*iye from accepting his invitation.
The cenvers~tiori at the table began to wax low, and there was
evidently a dearth of matter to afford them topics for continuing it,
when Mr Switzer rose first, and apologizing for his unavoidable;ab..
sence, begged to be excused, as he had an account to settle for
ecr~e hem~ he had bought in the morning.
When the ladies returned to the parlor, they entered a short time
into conversation, when Mr Oldbuck expressed his wish, that one
of the ladies should perform on the piano.
Martha looked at her mother, and Jane looked at Eliza, and all
~eemed to be in a state 'of consternation at the question that was~
put to them, and of doubt ~t the answer they should give, when the
mother broke silence~ and said, "that Louisa was the only one who
could play on the piano." 'Mrs Switzer took good care to add,
"that her daughter Louisa, had, received an excellent musical'
education, and could sing very well, if she pleased."
"gay I have the extreme felicity," said Jonathan Oldbuck, to~
hear a song from Miss Louisa. "Now do, Miss," said he, "your
rnot~ier'e remarks have quite raised my expectations, and I'm sure
I sho ~1d be, enchanted with it."
There was an evident twitching of the mouth, and a contortion'
of poor ~fiss Louisa's countenance, as she reluctantly complied
wi4h the request, ~ut assured Mr. .Oldb~iok that she seldom Mug.
"Now don't say so, Louisa, for you're chirping all day," said the

IN. SEARCH OF A WIFL

mother.' "' You wake tue in the' mornings with your singing, aiid
you are strumming constantly on the piano."
And poor Louisa. sat down to the piano, and sang the "Rose of
Allandale," with her notes pitched to 1~' sharp, and in such a clear
shrill voice, that' it might have been heard at the distance of a mile.
When the last line of the last verse was concluded, Mr Oldbuck
expressed his delight at the able manner in which she had executed
the piece, and the sweetness and melody of her voice. He hung
over the piano in an attitude which expressed all his abandon &amp; o~,
devotedness to the object of his attachment; he could not find
terms wherein to express his sense of the obligations he was under
to the fair lady for the treat she had afforded him, and was going
on to request a similar favor, when a loud rap was heard at the'
door, and who should enter but Mr Charles Seagrave, the gentle~
man who, Louisa told him, had presented her with the piece of
music which he so much admired.
Mr Seagrave having saluted the company, and shaken han~Ia
with the ladies, kept hold of that of Miss Louisa's longer than
usual, or that Mr Oldbuck thought was necessary. Seagrave
remained in conversation with Miss Louisa for some time, very much
to the discomfiture of~ Mrs Switzer, and to the annoyance of
Oldbuck, who shuffled about on his chair as if he had been seized
with an attack of" St. "Vitis' dance."
The' charm was indeed dissolved the moment Mr Charles Sea-
grave made his appearance, for Louisa's attention was wholly~
absorbed in his interesting conversation. He spoke of the pleasure
they had at the last party they were at, how agreeable was their
walk home, and how much he should enjoy. another stroll by moon.
light, all of which greeted very harshly ~ the ears of Oldbuck, and:
disconcerted the mother's plans. She, gave several wincing glances
at her daughter, which Louisa, however, did not take any notice~
of, but continued speaking with her Charley, unmindful of her~
mother or her admirer. ,
Mr Seagrave having concluded his conversation with Louisa,;
began talking polities with the mother, and they necessarily turned'
on the annexation of Cuba, Mr Seagrave taking care t~ mention's
(at the same time casting a glance at Louisa,) that he was a mem~
ber of the "Lone Star" Association, and that he was resolved to die
in the attempt to annex Cuba with this country. His remarks
were very patriotic, and excited a good deal' of attention, but they
were evidently displeasing to Oldbuck, who. would have preferred'
to hear Miss Louisa sing, or engage her in conversations.
Charley Seagrave was a young man of a rather prepossessing ap.:
pearance; he was thin, which Mr Oldbuok was not; he wore a bl&amp;e
.coat with brass buttons, and Mr Oldbuck's was black, and he 'had~
~a peculiar manner of dangling his pocket-handkerchief, which give
him quite a distingue' air izi Miss Louisa's opinion.' In fact, he wa~

~~would have liseri accepted by possibly he may not have conceived,
and in full trim to accompany mre two of them, were ready
him to the Museum.
{       The "Serious Family" was then in full vogue, and had been
nightly repeated for the last three weeks. Mr. Aminadab Sleek,
had entertained 'the audience with his drolleries and Vagaries, and
~ I~ ~ had drawn down thunders of applause, whenever he appeared pa
the scene.
*a~ But Jonathan O1~lbuck's plaudits exceeded all others; and when
the hero of the pioee W~ rather more interesting than usual, his
cheers amounted to a degree ,of"~ vociferation, which attracted the
whole audience.
p       Louisa, who wa~ seated next to him, begged of him to be silent,
but he still launched forth into the wildest bursts of enthusiasm.
Their situation became really unpleasant, and it was with joy
they greeted the falling of the curtain.
On their way home, Jonathan Oldbuck became rather bolder in

the Bowery, assumed to himself the privilege of squeezing how
hand, at the same time asking her whether his visits to her zero
agreeable.
"I don't know what to say at present," replied Louia, very
artlessly.
Oldbuck becoming more importunate, said, "May I not have the
pleasure of aspiring to your hand, Louisa, at some future day '!,~
"Really, Mr Oldbuck," said Louisa, "after our short ~acquaint..

at the door, begged him pressingly to enter and take some refresk.~

MATERNAL REFLECTIONS-OOOD ADVICE-SALLY~ IN ANOTHER QURTEEJ
(BUT HOPES I)OOMFsD TO BE DISAPPOINTED-MISS SYI'ORAH CLEMENTS.
WHEN Jonathan dldbuok came down to breakfast the following
rriorning, ha appeared rather paler than usual, and his mother,'wh.
always expressed ,the most anxious solicitude for her son's health,
inquired at what hour he came in on the previous evening.
'The son 'replied that it was early, and that he had been spending
the' evening with the Switzers.
"What, have 'you been wasting your time with that vulgar
family? I'm sure there is none of them that ought to engage your
attention; they're an ugly, flat-nosed, thick-lipped, set of girls, and
I'm surprised you should find anything in them to attract your
notice."
"Mother," said Jonathan, "I thought at first Louisa was rather
interesting, but I've since had reason to change my opinion. She
has no conversation, her manners are vulgar, as you say, and I
think 'she dresses' rather indecently, for her gown is made too low-
waisted~and she doesn't wear any scarf."
"The nasty, vnlgar thing," said Mrs Oldbuck. "I wonder her
mother allows it. IL never'admired those girls, and as for the three
eldest, they have necks as long as storks, and their noses reach
almost to their chins. As for Louisa, she is a port, flippant, little
thing, a~nd if I were her mother, I would confine her to the house,
and make her sew all day."
Jonathan's feelings corresponded with those of his mother's, for
he was angry with the Switzers, and felt particularly indignant
that Miss Louisa Switzer should not have responded to his profes-
sions of love.
He agreed with his mother that he had been mis-spending his
time, and decided on making amends for the future, by directing
his attention in another quarter.
(G I'm sure there's the Olements, and the Smiths, and a host of
other families, who would be proud to receive you,.and happy to
make your acquaintance. In fact Mrs Clernents was here the
other day, and almost insinuated as much as that she should like
my son to visit her daughter. Theophilus Ciements is a rich man,

'4
.Tonathai~, I knew him when ho was a boy; his father was an old.
beau of mine, and I should 'certaitily have married him, had~ ther8
not been so 'great a disparity between our ages."
This brought up sad reflections upon poor Jonathan's mind, ~or
he thought he would encounter much difficulty in engaging the
affections pf Miss Syporah Clenients, for the same reason that his
mother had refused her father.
He knew the young lady in question, but his ambition had never
extended to seeking the hand of the rich Mr. Clements" daughter,
and when his mother threw out the suggest
response in his bosom.      ,         on, it met with a ready
Three o'clock had hardly struck by the time-piece in the parlor,
when Jonathan Oldbuck, with a neat surtout tightly buttoned to
show off the proportion of his fine person, with his boots polished like
a mirror, his hat made after the -latest fall fashion, and his cane in
hand, sallied out to walk in the direction of Mr Clenients' house,
and solicit an interview with the lovely Syporah.
Giving a fashionable rat-tat-tat at the knocker, he was admitted
into the drawing-room, where Mrs Clements and her daughter were
receiving their visitors.
Every thing wore an air of rigidity 'in this house, to which
Jonathan Oldbuck was not at all accustomed. The door was
opened by a man-servant, who was habited in 'a neat costume, his
i~ame was announced rather loudly, and he was ushered into the
room, which was covered with a rich Wilton carpet, and in which
the furniture generally was very different from that which he had
seen at-the Switzers. There was ,a rich rose-wood piano, the sofas
and chairs made, of the same material, were )covered with fawn-
colored damask satin, and the curtains corresponded, there were
beautiful mirrors, hanging on the wall, and every thing betokened
an air of elegance and grandeur.
Miss Syporah. Clemonts was seated in one of the fauteuils, Which
was capacious enough to accommodate another of her rather
diminutive size. She could not have been over seventeen years of
age, for there was a sprightliness about her person which betokened
youth and vivacity, her face was rather~ remarkable for beauty, she
hada sparkling blue eye, her hair was auburn, and her nose and
chin were so well proportioned, that they set off her ether features
to advantage; she had a pearly set of teeth, her skin was beauti-
fully white, and 'her complexion had that 'rosy tint which is so
agreeable to most men. In fine, Jonathan Oldbuck' could not have
desired that Nature should have modelled a creature of finer pro.
portions to suit his taste.
After strutting into the room in the most fashionable manner,
and with that dktingue air which, he faiicied, he could at times
assume, saluting the ladies of the house, he seated himself near an
old maid, whose rustling silk dress he was afraid of spoiling, from

for when he returned home, su~h was the excess ~f 1ii~ jo~ 'at' th~2

his emotion.
"She's perfectly lovely, mother, and I should be the happiest of
men, jf I could indulge the hope for a moment, that s'he tild b&amp;

"I think, Jonathan, after what passed between Mrs Clements and
myself the other day, that it would be wrong in you to visit th~
house, without first making known your intention~ to the father.
You'll find him a worthy, sensible man, and I've no doubt, he w4l
listen, to your proposals with attention.',
"Mother, I scarcely kndw the girl yet, and how can I speak to the
father about the matter you refer to, without first gaining her &amp;fTeo-
tions ?"
"That's what I wish to avoid, my boy, for I think it very wron~
indeed, for young gentlemen to insinuate themselves into the affec.
tions of young ladies, without first making known tb~eir intentions,
to the parents, besides I hav&amp;too high respect for TheophilusOleni
ents to do him an injury, and with the graces and pec~liar charms
you possess, it would be wrong to win the lady's heart, without
first obtaining the father's consent."
Jonathan seemed also to be of the same opinion, at first he was
rather doubtful, but his mother's argument were so irresistible,
that he soon coincided with her, and resolved to seek an interview
with Mr Clements on the following morning. '
To the man of pleasure, New York affords almost as many amuse-

ola~ in the wildest profusion, hanging about the precincts, of th~
Astor and the Irving, 'taking care not to wander too far from the
vicinity of the saloons, where they have just regaled themselves, on
a glass of ean devie, a mint julep, or a brandy cocktail. There's the
merchant's clerk, too, who having spent the greater part of the day
at the desk, thinks he might amuse himself by a stroll in Broadway.
Putting on all the airs imaginable, he struts about, ac if he were in
po8sessir~ of his employer's independent fortune, h~ may be spend~
lug a little of it, but that's the merchant's own look out; when he
balances his books, there may be a trifling error, which defies the
experience and ingenuity. of the book-keeper. There's the verdant
oountryrnan, too, who, as the newspapers tell us, has a peculiar
taste for the companionship of mock auctioneers and all that sort of
persons. There's Paddy, with his better-half and a lot of little
"crathurs" following him, just landed from the ship, and looking
out for the guineas, which he was "tould" sprouted up spontane-
olisly from the American soil. There's the sawny Scot~hman, too,
who is always looking out for the main chance, and is searching for
a good location, where lie can manufacturt3 the most approved taffy
or Scotch marmalade. There~s a variety of other characters, mov-
ing on the scene, shifting and changing about, as often as a kaleidi.-
scope, and assuming new shapes and forms to s~uit every one's taste.
There's that often described, but incomprehensible "Moso~' of the
Bowery, who is never in his native element unless he's following a
fire engine, or is "some" at a fight, and there's the "ghal," too, who
is close on his heels, and who. thinks there's some intrinsic virtue in
the deep scarlet shawl, which covers her bosom.
All theso characters have been so often described, that it is tedious
to dwell on them, but they serve to snake up a whole, which can
only be~ seen on Broadway's wide pavement, on a fine summer's
afternoon.
Jonathan Oldbuck passed the remainder of the day, after his visit
to Mr Clement's, by making one of the crowd that was hurrying
through this thoroughfare, he was pushing and was pushed in his
turn, now and then turning round to espy a young lady, whose fea.-
tures attracted his attention, then seeing another, who he thought
was prettier than the one that had passed, finally, his heart becom.-
lag, so susceptiblee to the tender charms of the fair sex, tbat he
thought them all lovely alike. In his admiration of the "human
form diyine," of which he had so many opportunities of judging,
he paid no attention to his pocket or his fob, and when he returned
home found both.the one and the other minus his handkerchief and
his watch. These, however, are only the trifling consequences of'
that absence of mind, which is engendered by too much appreciation
of female charms.
~ Jonathan Oldbuck thought he would step in at Delmonico's,
where he would regale himself after the fatigues of his walk, on a

Y~ SEARCH OF A WIFE.                   29
beefsteak and a bottle of wine. When he entered, he saw' on~ of
his old friends, who was there' f~r the same purpose, and both ~at
down to a meal, wl;iich was worthy of the most particular~ epicure,
and which was served up in a nice little alcove, where they could
enjoy an hour's pleasant conversation.
Jonathan called for another bottle, and as an indulgence in wine
generally leads to conversation about women, he ~deseanted at great
length on the peculiar charms of the young lady, who, in his fond.
imagination, had already accepted him for a suitor. The name and
residence he withheld, but he could not find language strong enough
to express his unbounded admiration of the lady's virtue and
beauty.#
Ned Hammersley, for that was his companion's name, was almost
envious of his happiness, and stipulated, if not for an invitation, at
least for a large share of cake and other "fixings.,~
Jonathan Gidhuck assured him, That the moment his happiness
was consummated, he should certainly not forget him.
"And pray," asked Ned, "is the happy day fixed ?"
"Why, not exactly so," replied Jonathan, "but I am to see the
father to-morrow to settle the preliminaries."
"Why, Oldbuck, my dear fellow, have things been pushed so far
already? Indeed, you are a happy man, and I must congratulate
you; but is the lady rich ?"
"Rich, Ned. Why her father has the reputation of being a
millionaire, and mother says he prefers me for old acquaintance
sake."
"Tell me her name. Oh, do!" rejoined Ned, "I'm getting quite
Jonathan Oldbuck, who had already suffered "some" from the
effects of rivalry, was sufficiently circumspect to withhold the
name from a person of Ned's fine figure and rather handsnrie
countenance.
Twilight still found the friends in earnest conversation about the
fair sex, and the shades of evening, whi~h were rapidly enveloping
Broadway in darkness, would afford sufficient obscurity to hide the
excesses of liquor, so the third bottle had been called for, and
having, as they thought, indulged pretty freely, the two companions
sallied out for a walk.
As we have before said, Mrs Oldbuok hail not failed to put her
son on his guard against evil associates, and the danger of Broad-
way by gas..light. Jn fact Mr Oldbuck had an instinctive dread
himself of vice, which assumes such alluring forms in that thorough.
fare at night. He had taken quite enough wine to increase his
love for woman, for the former is an article which, like alcohol,
when it is applied to water, makes the latter boil and effervesce,
until it becomes so inflammable, that it almost consumes the posses.
sor. So it was with Jonathan Oldbuck, but his dread of vice was

.A.fter he had discussed a moderate share of broiled chiofr9xi,

l~~Ir Clements or not, but his mother having remarked, that "f~~t
heart never won fair lady," his mind was made up, and he. ~es.ly~dJ
to wait on Mr Clements after he had finished his toilet.
Going up stairs, after admiring himself a few minutes in the

After surveying himself for a short 1~irne in the lookin~~glass~ and
admiring his rotund figure, he went down stairs ana ask~d his

Ten o'clock had struck when Jonathan went to*see Mr Clement~.
lit was a latterr of business, and he thought it a good time to find
him at leisure.
Mr  ~heophilus Clements was in his private office, a sort of sa~c-
turn, which was, located on the second floor of his private house in.
University Place. He had enjoined the domestics not to disturb


32          JONATHAN OLDDlJC~

* hie privacy on any.pretext whatsoever, but to send whoever might
call on business to his counting-house in Water street.
When ~r Oldbuck rang the bell for admittance, he was told that
Mr Clements was engaged, and that he could not see him at pre-
sent, he begged of the servant to go up stairs and tell his master
that he wished to see him on very urgent business.
Mr Clements was rather surprised at such an unexpected visit
so early in the morning, and at once directed the servant to send
the gentleman up into his room.
He was introduced into a magnificent apartment, where he found
Mr Theophilus Clements dressed in a rich Persian morning gown,
and embroidered slippers, comfortably ensconced in a large arm-
chair, and seated at a writing desk.
Mr Clements belonged to that rather numerous class of persons
who were at first unsuccessful in business, and having failed, had
managed to save ,a large share of the profits of the concern for his
own individual benefit.
jie was the projector and manager of that enterprising company
which was originally started under the name of the "Lake Winne-
peg Copper Mine Association," in which so many persons had em-
barked, and invested a great part of their capital. The stock
immediately rese in the market, and reached on Change the
enormous rate of one hundred and fifty-three per centum. There
was quite an emulation amongst the citizens to become share-
holders, and all augured the brightest prospects from the able man-
agement of Mr. Theophilus Clements.
Fall came round, and with the falling of the' leaves, the bright
hopes of the share-holders fell to the ground, and in the first annual
report, which was published, it appeared, that the large sum of,
thirI~y thousand dollars had been expended in reports of geologists,
* outfitting of the miners, and the erection of smelting furnaces, but
not a word was said in it of the extent of the copper, save towards
the end, a distant allusion was made to a rather "rich vein," that
had been 'discovered, and which perhaps ran in union with Mr
Theophilus Clements' deep cogitations on the subject. He wound uj
- his report, by apologizing for the outlay, which he accounted for by
the, enormous expenses of the first outfit, and promised economy, &amp;c.
for the fntt~e.
The bait however would not take, and shares fell to an enormous
discount.' Mr Clements bought them all in, at the current rate,
* which was about three per cent on the share's of a hundred dollars
paid in, and this was the beginning and end of his fortune.
Mr Clements at once knew Oldbuck from having met~iim in the
streets, and 'tried (from his former intimacy with his father) to
prevail on him to tako shares in the "Lake Winnepeg Cop"per Mine
Association." Oldbuck's mind was then impervious to Mr Olenibnts'~

IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.                   33'
arguments, and the latter must at least have had a good opinion, of
his 'cuteness and penetration.
So on entering the room, Clements at once recognized Oldbuok,
and tendering him his hand, begged him to be seated.
"Well, good morning, my dear friend, I'm happy to see you
Pardon me if I receive you in my dressing-gown, but I went to bed
very late last night, I was out, but never - mind, pray what is your
business my good Sir ?"
Oldbuck took a seat, and saw with pleasure, that Mrs Clements
was not in the room, he first began the conversation by telling Mr
Clements of Mrs Clements' visit to his mother, then spoke about the
pleasure of his acquaintance with his daughter, and finally brought
round the topic to marriage.
Okibuck's point was gained so far, and he said
"Mr Clements, I've an object in calling on you, you're my'
father's old friend, and I've come to tell you, that I wish to get
married. I want to put a stop to the follies of a bachelor's life, and
to undertake thee responsibility of a wife and children, if Heaven
should grant me such a blessing; I think it the consummation of
man's ~appiness.~~
Mr Theophilus Clements shuffled about in his morning-gown, and'
began to laugh.
"My friend, you ma~ marry, if such be your wish, but I would
advise you to make a good match, I mean by that, a rich one, for
those only are good. One must place his name and family, like his
money, at good interest in these times."
"I can assure you, Sir, replied Jonathan, that I've no sort of
interest in the proposition which I've come here to make to you.
I've seen your daughter several times, and yesterday had the plea-
sure of rather a long interview with her. I am not insensible to her
very great charms, in fact, she pleases me very much, and I've come
to ask of you, her hand in marriage."
Mr Theoi~ilus Clements drew himself up in his arm chair, as-
sumed a niore serious look, and scrutinizing Oldbuck in a way,, as
if he had never before set eyes on him, or as one whose character
he wished to know more of, said ,to him, in a tone ef voice,, which
partook no longer of politeness,                -
"Is it my daughter's hand you have come to ask me for ?"
"Yes," said Oldbuck, "it is her hand."
"'Ah! that's a verx different thing. I didn't expect it. I
suppose, you have wffi her heart, (the father giving a searching
glance at Oldbuck) for that, you know is preliminary to asking her
hand."
Oldbuck was going to reply, when Mr Clementa continued
"I know very little of your pecuniary affairs, I always took you'
to be a man of moderate means, but I may have been mistaken, and
possibly your fortune may be equal ~to mine. Excuse me, my dear

ws~fortu~ is equarto my own.~
- O~upk was at a loss to. know ~hat to say, here was an unfor..
seen' difficulty, whioh 'he was 'not prepared to meet.
Mr Clements observing his trepidation, came to his relief, and
~eaid :-
"Now, betwee~i friends, tell me how much you are worth, in
'property, as in money ?"
Oldbuck fixed his spectacles in their proper place, rubbed one of
'i1ip" ears, and replied
That he was worth somethingg 'between eight and nine hundred
dollars a year, in "United St~tes 6's."
~ What is that you say," asked Mr Clements, "eight or nine

Mr Clem6nts 'again., drew himself back in his arm chair; and

8tyle,~ and everything that could be thought of. As for Champagne,
it flowed like water, and what with a few musicians front jDod~-
worth'#. band, I can assure you, we enjoyed ourselves a great deal,
and Syporah was very much pleased."
The husband and father became rather irritated, as Charlotte was
reciting the luxuries of the supper table, and pet1~ishly observed,
"that such feasts in many cases prognosticate long fasts, and h8
believed Mr Fitz Simmons would find it so.~
"This will never do, this will never do," said Mr Theophihis
Cl&amp;ments, rising from his arm chair, and striding up and down the
room in his long morning-gown and embroidered slippers. "For the
future, you must let me know, who are Syporah's admirers. I have
no idea of her contracting a mesalliance as the French term it, and
as she will have some, money, I dare say many worthless young
men will be paying their addresses to her."
"You need'nt be afraid," said Charlotte, "that she will do any.
thing against my wishes, she is a kind affectionate creature."
"There's been a matter on my mind, for some time past," said Mr
~Theophilus Clements to his wife, "which I've been wishing to
~broach both to Syporab. and yourself. There's my old friend Isaiah
*~ibson, who became a widower last year, he has a sneaking regard
for Syporab., I know he has, and you should cultivate it as mu'ch as
possible. He's rich, has an elegant house,. and moves in the best
circles of society, he would make an excellent husband 'for my
daughter."
"Isaiah Gibson !" ejaculated Charlotte, "why he's old enough to
be her father, that bald-headed, red-faced fellow, to be my Syporah's
husband, why the poor girl would go into fits, if he even approached
"That's the reasonn" said the father, "I wish to mention the
subject to you, the girl must not be indulged in her whims. Pve
set my mind on it, and you know (placing a peculiar 'emphasis on.
the last word) that I generally have my way. He has monet, and
those. only know how to value it, who have been at the most pains in
~aking it."
"I know that," said Charlotte, "but isaiah Gibson, 'Angels and
ministers of grace defend ~is,' I shall not even mention it to
~Syporah,~' and Mrs Theophilus Clernents banged the door az~d went
~ut of the room in a passion.
Jonathan Old~buck spent the day pretty much in the same manner
in which. he had passed the previous one, excepting that he tok a
quiet dinner with his mother, who was particularly inquisitive' to
find out the ~esul~ 'of his interview with Mr Clements.

in the morning.
of Mr Theophilus Clements was more irritable than usual, the events
tho morning did i~ot altogether please him, and what happened
during the remainder .bf the day, did not tend to increase his coin-
posure. He had been trying rather unsuccessfully to engage a few
of his friends to take shares in another company, which he had
lately formed to reclaim a valuable traot of land, which was well
adapted for purposes of cultivation, but he could not induce any or
them to enter into his views.
' He was thinking over the matte'rF when Jonathan Qidhuck
entered, and his appearance in such an inopportune moment had no
~ffeet in making him more agreeable.
"Sit down, Sir," said Mr Theophilus Clements, to Mr Jonathan
Oldbuck, "pray, what is your business? Ah! I remember, mar-
?iage and so forth.
"Ycu are too poor, Sir, I told you so in the morning, and there
was no necessity for your returning to get the same answer in the
~evening. 'A word to the wise,' &amp;c., you know my old boy," and
tapping him on the shoulder, said, "you had better look out and fish
in a~iothor quarter. If I remember rightly, my old school fellow,
Jonathan Oldbuck, your father, I mean, managed to scrape together
~a few hundred dollars out of the greasy business, in which he was
engaged, and with what he has left you, you ought to be able to
procure a suitable partner in life, who will jog along with you pretty
much in.your own way."
"Mr Clements," said Jonathan, "I did not come here to be in-
Lulted. You laughed at me this morning, and you insult me this
evening. 1 love your daughter, 'and
"Confound your love," said Theophilus Clements, "you are too
poor, and I bid you good evening, ~5ir."
Jonathan Old~uck made his exit, muttering between his teeth,

better part of valor," did not say it

CHAPTER V.
.A1~0THER NTRIGUI~"-MI55 CLARISSA 5~ tny~-4AuR I~OTki~k, ~
Y.AIR &amp;NJ~A.
W~1EN Jonathan Qidhuck rose in the morning, he wa~ in a m~iet
phil9sophic mood, he thought on the ~anitie~ 'of human life, and
p~de~ed.over the inordinate ambition of ~narxkind. Aftor all, life

As for the Clements, they were a purse.proud, ignora~v ~et, andhe
w~xdered why his 'mother ~hduld -have tdld him to ,a'll on ~uoh
pe~ple.
When he was again seatedit the breaki~ttabls, he rbmonet±~t~d
with her on ihe ;itnprejifiety 'of 'her conduct, and ~~dd 'tli~t he 'would
not take her advice for the future.
" Jonathan, 'n1y'-b~y," -said MrsOldbuok,"' p~hs-t~'~ bebn.

"I never told yoti~, ohiidto ask for ~
her; I only said it was improper to engage her affections before you
had spoken to the father to get permission to visit the house. You've
been too quick, Jonathan."
Jonathan felt as if his mother were right, and he inwardly re~
broached himself for~having used more of the fortitet in re than the
snaviter in modo, in his nt~gooiations with the Clernents.
However, to a man of the world, like Jonathan Oldbuek, the
contre temps, which he had experienced at the hands of Mr Theophi.
Ins Clements, did not weigh long on his mind, and he begged of his
mother, as a favor, not to refer to the subject again.
At his usual flour he went out to take his afternoon's walk, and

-       IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.
meetiiig with his friend, Ned Hammersicy, they both repaired to
Thompson's for a lunch.
On their way there, Ned Hammersicy asked Jonathan what day
had been fixed for the celebration of his nuptials?
"With whom do you mean ?" asked Mr Oldbuek.
"Why, with that rich and beautiful girl, whose praises you
sounded so extravagantly the other night, that you almost excited
my jealousy."
"Pooh! pooh !" said Jonathan; "it was only a joke, Ned, and. I
wanted to see how you would take it."
The matter passed off, and they both entered Thopmson's saloon,
where they ordered roast quail and a bottle of claret, to regale
their delicate appetites. Having taken a view of the surrounding
VisitOrs, they entered rather seriously oi~ the task of discussing the
choice repast set before them. Having done ample justice to it,
they were about leaving, when a 'lady, dressed in black silk, having
settled her bill at the counter,.accidentaily dropped he~r porte~manb
~ntde, and hurriedly left the saloon.
Mr. Oldbnok picked it up, and with that gallantry~ for which he
was always remarkable, went out in search of the lady; there wasa
great crowd in Broadway and he could not find he?.
Returning into the saloon, he mentiiined the circumstance to his
friend Hammereley. The latter advised him 'to open it, to' see
whether it would afford any clue to the name of the-owner.
He did so, and found a letter in it,' which was addressed to Mra -
Augustus Shrewsbury, street, New Yo~k. There ~as
money in it also, and Jonathan putting it carefully into~his po~ket~
said he would deliver it personally to Mrs Shrewsbtmry.
'~Let us go there now," said Ned, "it may be a"case,' and we
may hei'vo some fun."
"I. don't know what you mean by a 'asse.' Why what's a
'easel"'
"Why, you foolish fellow, you. I mean the husband- may b~

"Indeed, then let us go, we have nothing bOtter to do, and ean

~o off the gay roucs set, and had no difficulty in finding Mrs
Shrewsbury's residence.          '      -
They were at once admitted and found 'the wid0vr in great ~l*.
tress. She had discovered' her' loss, and sent 'Clarissa 'to the news.
paper office with an advertisement, offering a large reward for tbe
discovery of the porte.montzcde. It contained the -only letter that
she had received from her beloved'" Gus," he had been absenb~
~whQle yeax', and as it was -the first- taews she heatd' lroxti: him, -~4~'
valtied it more highly than -all' 'the- money the- ptwte'm iIfiI0 (t.

40               'JONATHAN OLDBUOK
£ Jonathan was the first to speak, he said,'" I am really happy to
be the means of recovering such a precious testimonial of regard.
It must be exceedingly soothing to a wife's feelings to receive a letter
from her' husband after such a long, absence. I almost envy you
your happiness, madam."
Whether it was the recovery of the letter, or the very agreeable
manner in which' it was announced, that wrought such a wonderful
change in Mrs Shrewsbury's feelings, it is impossible to say, but
~she winced and smirked, and appeared so interesting, that she won
insensibly on the hearts of her visitors.
Mrs ShreWsbury was the wife of an officer who had distinguished
himself in the Mexican War, and having married young, was blessed
'~$th an only daughter, whom she had named Olarissa after her
grandrizother, on her maternal side. The old lady died, leaving
~larissa nothing but her name, and the' family being reduced in
circumstances , Mr Shrewsbury emigrated to California. His wife
was a woman of about forty years of age, possessing the renin~,nts
of what must have been handsome features in her youth; she had
black hair, and flaming black eyes, the certain indications of burn-
i~g passion, which must have reduced her to a cinder. It was a
wonder how ~he~oould have so long withstood her husband's absence,
*tid froin~ tli~ regret which she manifested at his departure from hei,
*be must have felt it a great deal.
She ~piAogized to the gentlemen for Clarissa's unavoidable
#b~ence. but begged them to believe that she would always be grate-
f~il to. thorn for their kindness, and would be happy to cultivate their
~quaintance.
Mr Oldbuok looked at Mi~ Hammerslcy, and Mr Hamnrersley at
~ )~r Oldbuok, and both cast their eyes in turn on the '~ widow," who
was waiting to hear what they would say.
~, Ned, who was always ~ready for a "venture," remarked, "L )e-
hove, Oldbuok, we have no particular engagement this evening,
I~ve we ?"
"None, whatever, Hammersley, as 1 know of."
~" Then," replied the other, "we might come round this even-
- "I shall be delighted to see you, gentlemen; come early, if. you
pl~ase."
"We shall do so with pleasure, madam," and they took leave of
~rs Augustus Slirewsbury.
~~Ont~heir4 way home, Ned revelled' in the delight of the, enjoyment
ii. shcul4 4erivo from the lady's company. "Oldbixok," said he,
~.$hese C~li(ornia widows are a much persecuted race of beings;

might have their husbands with them."

IN 'Sl~ARCH.OF A WIFI~
- "It's a sad state," said Jonathan, "to bejn."
*" Yes, and that's the reason," rejoined Ned, "why I'm more par-
ticular in my attentions to those ladies whose husbands have left
thorn," at the same time nudging his friend under the arm.
"It's a settled thing, then," said Oldbuck, "that your addresses
will be paid to the widow, and mine to the daughter."
"Very well," said Ned, "I'm pleased with the bargain."
Ned Hammersley was one of those young men of the town whose
company must have been very dangerous to young ladies or Califor.
nia widows. His father died when he was young, leaving him .a
handsome fortune, and with a disposition to use it freely. He was
about thirty-five tears of age, of a good figure, rather dark corn.
plexion, 'but with a manly face and forehead that was exceedingly
pleasing. He had dark hair and dark eyes, which sparkled almost
as much as those of the gay widow's herself, and when they looked
at each other, it was impossible to say which werw~ the most corn.
'bustible.
The two gay row, intent on an evening's amusement, repaired
-at the appointed hour to the residence in -~- street. Of course,
on this occasion, they found Clarissa at home, and bin Oldbuck's
eyes, no one appeared more lovely. She was twenty years of age,
.f a slight but graceful figure, and as for the face, it con~bined all
'the varied attractions of a 'perfect Hobe. She had dark hair and
dark eyes, like her mother's, a small ear and nose, a row of ivory,
which had never been under the dentist's paw, together. with a
mellowness in the peculiar tint of her complexion, which rendered
4her enchanting in tIle eyes of all.
Jonathan Oldb~ucks heart was always susceptible, but it became
an easier conquest than ever, before the surpassing charms of the
fair Clarissa. Whilst Ned Hammersl.y was engaged in earnest
-eonversaticn on the sofa with Mrs Shrewabury, Jonathan's qyes
were not large enough~ to                             I
charms of Miss Clarissa. survey at one glance, the multip ied
It had come to that affecting point in the conversation, when
Mrs Shrewsbury showed Mr Ilammersley a daguerreotype of her
husband, a display which California widows might well dispense
with, for if the husband is found to be ugly, it only adds 8trongth
to the ambitious hopes of the widow's admirers.
Of course Ned Hammereley remarked what a good-looking man
her husband was, although he could find no authority for the 8tate.
meat in the picture itself. Mr Augustus Shrewsbury had a large
hooked nose, which had some similarity with an elephant's tusk,
and goggle eyes, which, if they could hayc revolved i~ the pi9tnre,
would have given him a more natural appearance. Ned thought4 to
himself what an ugly looking mortal 'this fellow is, and wondered
ho~ 'he had ~aptivated the heart of the engaging Mrs Shrewebtiry..
"The oonvqrsation was on various 'a~bjects, and very entertaining.

Mrs Shrewsbury continued, and it turned out to be all "moon-

and cruel disappointments, but' so far I have met with none myself,

will turn, when they are driven to necessity. I saw Mr B.-.., the

into a cook. The only want we experience in this country is that
of woman, '.happy woman,' for I can assure you the cooking is
horrible, and we experience much trouble on that account. Were
you here, I think I could enjoy a pate de fois gras, or a fat leg of
* mutton."
(Here Ned Hammersley looked at Jonathan Old buck, and both.
looked at Mrs Shrewsbury, who was so intent on her husband's
letter, that she did not notice them.)
The widow proceeded with other matters in Mr Augustus ~hrews~

to the end, which was concluded in these affectionate terms

THE agreeable relations subsisting between the Shrewsbury's and
their new friends had continued for aboiit ten days, during which
time Jonathan Oldbuck and his friend Ned Hammersicy had reaped
rich rewards from the overflowing gratitude of the gay widow and
her daughter for the small favors which their friends had conferred
on them, such as bringing them to the Bowery and the An1phitheatr~,
slight donations, &amp;c., when Mr Oldbuck with a face elongated as
long as his arm, and Ned Hammersley with a sigh, which he could
Dot repress, announced to them their intention of proceeding for a
few days to Cincinnati on business, which required their immediate
attention. They would not be long absent, f~r matters of importance
would necessitate their return to the city by the beginning of the
following week.. They had come for the purpose of bidding Mrs
Shrewsbury' and her (laughter adieu, and when they made the an~
nouncement, all wore sorrowful countenances, but Mrs Shrewsbury'~
was the saddest of all. Her face was generally remarkable for' a.
slight pallor, but on this occasion when she heard the sad news, it
became so pale, that Ned Hammersley almost pitied her distress.
"And will you be so long away ?" asked the gay widow, "bo&amp;
Olarissa and myself will miss you very much. I never shall forget,
indeed I sha'nt, 'that delightful walk we took the other night, whem
Clarissa. and Mr Oldbuck left us to go to the saloon.~~
"Why did you remain so long, Olarissa'? You were away at

Olarissa, said, "that Mr Oldbuck persuaded her to go into an io~-~
cream saloon, where they remained for a short time, that she didn't
like to do so, but as Mr Oldbuck told her, that her mother was in
good hands, she finally consented."
"I never enjoyed myself so much in my life," said Mrs ~hriwa..-
bury, 'giving rather an interesting look to her friend Ned Ham-
mersley, and he looking as innocent as a lamb.
Clarissa observed, "we spent our time very pleasantly, also, Mr
'Oldbuok was prolific in his generosity, he gave me a cornz4.copia,

hUed with the choicest lion bons and mottoes, and I have been amus.
nag myself for the last few days in reading them, and trying to find.
out their meaning. Some of them are very ambiguous, indeed; and
I think our poets might apply their wits to better purposes than
writing such trash." Ol~rissa was rather nettled, which Mr
JonathanOldbuck, her admirer, did not fail to observe, and he
began muttering an apology for having given them to her. His
face became as red' as fire; and in his excitement his spectacles were
nearly falling off his nose.
"Indeed," said he, "of course you cannot belieVe I knew what
7was on the mottoes, or otherwise I should certainly not have
9ffeflded my fair Clarissa's delicate taste by giving them to her."
"I perfectly excuse you," said Clarissa, at the same tim~bLush-
ing up to her eyes.
After a rather protracted interview, the gentlemen got up to leave,
t~ed Hammersley hanging most lovingly over the fair Angelina,
and Jonathan Oldbuok looking most desperately into Clarissa's
black eyes.
They were loathe to part, but at length they tore themselves
away, after heaving a bushel of sighs, and promising not to forget
each other during their absence.
The door had been shut for a few moments, when Mrs Shrews
bury forgot something, which she ought to have said to Mr Ham
mersicy, and the latter having heard the door open, went back to
see \her. Whilst he was in the hall, she whispered something in
his ear, as he held his arm half-way round her waist, ~nd they then
separated.
Railway travelling affords sufficient time for thought and reflec.~
tion, in fact, one's thoughts are often the only companions one has
on a long journey. Ned Hammersley reviewed the scenes of the
last few days, he thought of the folly of men in leaving their wives
for so long a period, and of the frailty of women, and attributed the
numerouss divorces and elopements, whioh had come to his knowl-
adge to one cause or t~ie other, or perhaps to both. He thought,
however, that men were most to blame, for knowing how weak and
fragile is the female sex, generally, they require some support from
~ husbands or lovers. The human frame is weak, but human passion
is strong, and the / tenement, which holds it, is like a boiling
cauldron, which, when too much fire is applied, it runs the risk of
~being totally consumed. Woman's heart is indeed like a sapling,
full of strength and elasticity, but liable to be broken by the
slightest gale of adversity. It is a wonder then, that men can be
.~sp cruel as to leave their ~ives for so long a~ time, pining away in
that state of desolation they see around them, after having enjoyed
the tender care of loving husbands. As for Mrs Shrewsbury, thought
'~ed Harnmersley, she was a pattern of virtue and morality. I4~
is true, she was at that time of life, when passion was about to ebb

:rat~.er than flow, but she still had a few nwre yeara loft to her, in
which she. could indulge in the infirmities~ of her nature. What an
~eye, thought Ned, it sparkled, like a flame from the purest ant/ira.
cite, and kindled emotions, which it was hard to repres.~ It is
well I lett~ said he to himself, or IL might have been the very
innocent means of severing a marriage knot, which I believe was
once tied pretty closely; but which had become rather loose of late
by the long absence of her husband.
Jonathan Oldbuck's thoughts were directed in another channel,
the course of his true love had run smooth enough, as long as ho
indulged Miss Clarissa with tickets to the theatre or chocolate
bon bons. This was the summum bonumm of her fond desires, and
whilst his generosity lasted, she had no objection to lavish a few
small favors on him, but whether she ever entertained any serious
thoughts of a closer connexion than that of friendship, time alone
could tell. Herattenti~ns to Mr Oldbuck were not, however, with-
out their effect on his ,m~ind. He fancied she was extremely devoted
to him, and conned over, whilst, he was in the rail ears, the many
trifling indications she had shown of her love and regard for him.
Mr Oldbudk was a man of inordinate vanity, he thought his ap..
pearance betokened a person, who would not have to wait long,
whilst knocking for admission into a fair lady's heart. In his own
opinion, his charms were irresistible, and he attributed his forrAer
failures more to the want of appreciation amongst the fair sex, than
t~ any defect of his own. For the future, said he to himself, I shall
not wait to batter down the out-works, but shall storm the citadel
itself. At the first shock it must yield before the power which is
brought to bear against it.
"Clarissa. Oh! the charming Clarissa, on my return from C~za-
~cinnati, I shall take you to my arms, and we shall live to
happily !".                                        getherso
Such were his vain imaginings; he had again erected a castle in.
the air, in which his fair Clarissa was to be the guardian angel, and
he wpuld make the proposition to her as soon as he returned to
the city.
The travellers indulged in these fond aspirations, which served to
while away the time on their journey, but the shades of night
having intervened, they fell into a quiet repose, until the arrival of
the cars in the Queen City.
On the following morning, they found themselves comfortably
~setthid at the "Burnet," where they regaled themselves for.a few
days on the choice fare which "min6 host," set before ihem. It
was approaching the first of August, tI&amp;e anniversary of that day, on
which the sons of Africa were set free in the West India Islands,
and their bretkren in Cincinnati were to keep up a jubilee on the
occtision with more than usual sp~rit.
The Programme had been published, a few day~s before. The


JONATHAN OLDBOCK
procession was to move ~from the corner of Broadway and sixth,
which was in the proximity of the quarter, inhabited by the colored
race. Great were the doings on this memorable occasion, Dinah
put era her neatest apron and most gaudy shawl, whilst the black
barber of Race Street polished his boots to make them appear as
shining as his face. The pinch-beck watch chain had been washed
~with soap, until it almost shined like gold, and CujJee looked as if
he cot~Id enchant all the fair! ladies he met with, and point his
arrows at their hearts. Fred Douglass was 'spected, to make a
speech, 4~hich would astonish the whites.
"Dinah," said Cuft'ee, "the words tumble out of his mouth like
'hot buck-wheat cakes out of Aunt Sally's pan, he's a regular rolling
mill, he never tires,' and he goes on and on, until he has nothing
more left."
"Ah !" said Dinah, "you're only joking, sure the great 'Postle
of Liberty and Champion of the Colored people's rights' stops te
take breath, he can't speak for ever without taking time to think."
"Now, Dinah, dear, I tell you what, he speaks first, and thinks
arter'wards, he's' an ,extraordinary fellerr, and you'll open your eyes
when you sees him."
"Now, Cuffee, you don't say so," and Dinah went &amp;way to tell
Betsy what she had heard.
This was pretty much the substance of what was said amongst
the dense masses of the coal-colored gentry of Cincinnati on jubilee
day. At length three or four carriages arrived, conveying the
choicest specimens of black humanity to the starting point of the
'procession, but on looking through the windows of the vehicles,
Jonathan observed several lighter shades of the "human form
divine," he stopped to gaze, and wondered if that nice young lady,
~with her long flowing black curls, and delicate complexion wa~s
going to the feast, in company with that black man.
Ned said, "be quiet, Oldbuck; it may be his wife or daughter,
and if the niggers overhear you, they may be offended."
"Hammersley," said Jonathan, "I don't want to be humbugged,;
and I tell you what, that girl is a white girl, and she has no right
to be seated alongside of that big black Aigger."
"Hold your tongue, Jonathan, or, I'll leave you; the colored
raoe are not more sensitive on any point than on that of their color,
and they don't like to be called niggers, I can assure you. If you
oorne with me to the"' meeting which is only a couple of miles frora~
the city, I'll show you a sight which you never before have wit-
nesseci. That girl'in the carriage is not a white girl, she has Africau
blood in her, but the streani has poured through so many channels
since it left its fountain, that it has assumed another color on the-
passage."
Carriages continued to arrive, bands of music played swe.t-
s~ielodies, flags were flying, and corps of black "United Ameri-~

N SEARCH OF A WIFE.
cans," with no other contrast but the white aprons they wore, joined
in the procession. It was quite an animated scene, and the city
seemed fer the day to be so much given up to the blacks, that one
might have thought he, was sojourning in the dominions of King
Faustin, rather than under the mild sway of President Fillmore.
"This is a great sight," said Jonathan.
"Yes," said Ned; ~" and I am glad to see it, for in this land of~
liberty, men of all classes, creeds, and colors, should enjoy'the most
perfect equality, and although I do not believe that the negro race
are either socially or physically our equals, yet, in a political point
of view, they have a fair claim to equal rights."
"This is a topic, Ned, on which I don't like to speak, it had better
be left alone. Let every man mind his own business, and not attend
to that of others, the world would jog on a little smoother."
Oldbuck and Hammersley took the cars which brought them to
the place of meeting. It was situated on a rising ground, from
which there was a full view of the Ohio; with the neatly decorated -
tents, from which flags were flying, the martial music which was
heard, and the gay dresses of the colored ladies, who were there in
numbers, it was an enlivening scene, and one which would remaiii
impressed on the memory for some time. The locality which was
selected, was agreeable in the extreme, the wildness of the scenery
and the sylvan appearance of the green sward, on which the ladies
were to dance, were in striking contrast with ~he view of th~
distant cupolas and church spires of the Queen City, and the gaily
painted steamers, as they were stemtning their way down the
Ohio. Everything betokened ~n afternoon and evening's amusement,
and both Ned and Jona~than were delighted at the prospect.
A stand had been erected for the speakers, and the motley group
surrounded it in the anxious expectation of hearing the oratiox~s.
It was a curious spectacle to ~c: There was the woolly-headed
"nigger," who looked as if he had just made his escape from
Africa, the mulatto, the quadroon, and the mustafina, they wete 6f
all grades, shades, and tints, and it would have taken quite a c~rrn-
noisseur in the varieties of the African race to have pronounced what
class each belonged to.
The "Postle of Liberty and Champion of the colored peoj~les~
rights," was not there, but there were other speakers from at home ~
and abroad,' there were freemen and bondsmen, and pretty little
bondswomen too, who had obtained their masters' or mistress's leave
to come and see the great spectacle on jubilee day.
There was one in particular who struck Oldbuck's attention'frouL
her great beauty. Her name was BelIb. Hall, and she came fror~
Covington, Kentucky. There were but few traces left of A~frioan
origin in that girl; she had light hair and blue eyes, and her oem
plexion yielded not in whiteness to P~rian marble; her figure was~

as light ~d airy ~s a fawn,, and her vwaQity B4 rw11hKi4i~essjndi~
oated'that she' did not feel her eonditi9a as a slave.
In answer to an inquiry, which Oldbuck rn&amp;de. to one o.~ the
-negroes, he heard that she was, the property of an old w~n~a~z in
Kentueky,~who treated her with as much kindness as if she were
'ber child, and who, it was supposed, would give her her freedom;
~pnd leave her a large property at her death.
* Jonathan bristled up like a. porcupine at the sight of so much
loveliness in such an assembly, and it was with difficulty his friend,
I{x1 Harnmersley, could restrain him from rendering homage on the
spot to her, who might have been justly denominated the "Q..ueea
of Be~u~ty" at the feast. He became quiet impetuous, and like a
1'nll.bloor.led steed, that wished to 'escape from, harness, tried to tear
himself away from his friend Hammersley, and repair tp tue si4e' of
the lovely slave.
"Oldbuok, what are you about ?" said NecL "IDo you forget
Clarissa, already ?"
This name operated as a charm, or rather it hada p~ogative in-
~Iuenoe, over the min&amp; of the ardent lover, which preventedhim
'from breaking his vows of constancy to the adorable ol~ject of his
love,~the guardian angel in that sweet mansion in -~ street.
U~e managed to control that overflowing passion which curdled his
~lopd, and kept him in a ~state of excitement during the whole of
the evening, but he now and then, c9uld not restrain himself from
castingg a. few sheeps' eyes in the direction where Bella. I{all was
sitting, and watching 'her movements with anxiety.
It was approaching towards sunset, and the scene became even
more animated. Carriages continued to arrive, setting down some
of the most fashionable scions of aristocracy in negrodom. Maria
Seacoal and Harriet Ritchie, came in the same carriage with Peter
'L*room and 6~-eorge ~orgle, William Smart accompanied ]~etsy
'Palmer and Mary Ann TownsWind. All tha.t was lovely amongst
'the colored "gemmen" and ladies of the Qneen City, congregated
*on the spot to celebrate the anniversary of the emancipation of their
f~dlow 'countrymen in the British West India Islands. It was a
cheeringg spectacle to behold, but the dance was the most amusing
part of all.
Mr Charles Price 'with his face shining like ivory-black, and his
ouxly hair, which needed not the barber's tongs to pat it in order,
but which derived additional lustre from a quantity of "Maoass4r"
he had poured over it, was the type of his class on this occasion;
he wore a black coat and pants, a richly variegated vest, in whi~h
~ora~ige and scarlet were the predominating colors, aud a scarf, which
for originality and beauty, could not be surpassed, it had a rich
fringe at both ends, which hung so gracefully over the vest, white
'kids and patent leather boots completed the costume, which must
have made him quite captivating in the eyes of his sable corn-

ideal and personification of all that was fashionable in negi~-.
cracy.
Su~annah Leake did knot yield in point of female attractions to'
any of her sex. What Charles Price was amongst the men, sh~
was amongst the w~men. When she alighted from her carriage all
eyes were set upon her; she wore a light blue muslin, with a pro...
fusion of jewelry, part of which she concealed by a rich lace scarf,,
her hair was tastefully arranged with blue rosettes, which afforded
a pleasing contrast with the jet black wool that was separated
neatly over the forehead, and brushed back so smoothly that one
could hardly distinguish the curls! She wore short sleeves, and
her dress was low..neoked, displaying the admirable symmetry of a~
fine pair of shoulders and large fat arms. She put on all the aira
imaginable, and carrying a colored paper fan in her hand, almost as
large as a windsail, she never appeared more graceful or lovely in
the eyes of 'her admirers.
There was the usual quantity of stout "niggers" and f&amp;t )~urly
negresses, making up the crowd, and adding variety to the scene
The ladies were seated on rows of long benche~, which were pro~
vided for the occasion, and when the band struck up the enlivening
air of a cotillion, it was an amusing sight to see Mr Sam Mar-
shall soliciting the hand of Miss Susan Crow in the dance. It was;
still more amusing to see them dance.
Jonathan envied Mr Charles Price as he gracefully bent over the
pretty Bella Hall, and brought her to her position in the cotillion,.
he said-
"Ned, I should like to be in that nigger's place, and I shall asIc
her to dance the next cotillion with me."
"IDo you want to disgrace yourself?" said Ned. "Why, if if
were known in New York, the very boys would cry out, 'that man,
Oidbuok, danced with, a nigger,' and you would be shunned and
despised by all respectable society. Even Clarissa wouldn't speak
to you again, and then what would you do ?"
"Let us go away, then," said Oldbuck, for I don't like to see
that beautiful girl handled about so rudely by those rough-looking-
uiggers.~~
"Indeed I shan't," said Ned; "are you such a fool that yon
can't remain here' as a quiet spectator, and see what is going on,
without wishing to out up your capers and dance with the
niggers ?"
Mr Oldbuck did not approve of his friend Hammersley's philoso-.
pity, and seemed' to be in a state of doubt during the remainder or
the evening. His was a very susceptible nature, it was like wat

When once he had been any object that attracted his attention, par-

THEY remained a few days in Cincinnati, during which n

Queen City, they went to the rail-road station where the h
and snorting locomotive was ready to whirl them along to
abode. In thirty-six hours they found themselves within b
distance of the objects of their love; and having arranged
toilets, they hastened to make known their arrival to Mrs S~
bury and her daughter. Lovers take precedence of parent
other relations, and neither Old buck nor Hammersley suffered
filial duties to interfere with their feelings for the objects ol
affection.
Leaving their valises in a place of safety, they got into a -
street stage, and were leisurely driven up Broadway. 01

tedious to her during his absence, that she really did not know what
to do. As f&amp; Clarissa, looking at Mr Oldbnck, I can assure you
she missed all the concerts and theatres you took her to, and she.
says she has not had a stick of candy! since you left.
Clarissa came into the room to speak for herself, and if Mrs
Shrewsbury's joy was excessive at meeting with Mr Harnmersley,.
Mr 'Oldbuok's was equally immoderate at seeing the fair Clarissa.
An hour passed off very agreeably between the re-united party, and
nothing would have occurred to mar Mr *Oidbuck's pleasure on the~
occasion, but an allusion~, which his friend. Ned indiscreetly made,
to "the love adyent~re at the jubilee.
Clarissa was 'inquisitive-her mother stared-and Jonathan

Ned Hammersley called at seven for his friend Oldbuck, and they
both proceeded to street. On theii~ way there, Ned said that
the "rappers" had arrived in town, and that he should' like to take
Mrs Shrewsbury 'and her daughter to see, them.
Mr Oldbuck agreed to the proposition; and a short time after
their arrival at Mrs Shrewsbury's, the ladies were habited in 'theit
bonnets and shawls to ~go 'and hear what the spirits had to say. In
rather a large hail in -~- street, there was a "social circle" sitting
round a black walnut table. The company consisted of three ladies
and two gentlemen, there being but one medium, present, and she
was a fe!nale, for it seems the spirits have a peculiar taste for com-
inunicating with their friends through the gentler sex, ~ sort of
moral infirmity in which they share with other mortals. To judge
of the character of the audience from the outward signs of in-
tellectuality they manifested, one would not have had a very high
opinion of their mental attainments, but they made up in credulity
what they lacked in judgrr.ient, for they were deeply intent on every
demonstration of spiritual agency.
Whether it~ was from Mr Oldbuck's grotesquee appearance, or
from his close proximity to the medium, he was the first to attract
her notice, and she asked him whether he had any relations
or friends in the other world, with whom he desired to communi-
cate?
Jonathan replied that he had; but his frequent glances at
the other side of the table, where Miss Olarissa was seated, in-
dicated that he would ' sooner commune with~ beings below than
above.
The medium handc4 him a paper on which. he was to write seve-
ral names, and amongst them the name of the relative with whom
he desired to communicate. The spirit would intimate his readi-
ness to hold a communication, by giving three raps wheir he carrie
to the name of his relative, and but one for all the others.
Jonathan began with pencil and paper in hand, and having passed
over several names, which he marked, when he came to his father's,
of course he showed a little trepidation, which th'e keen eye of
the fair medium did not fail to observe, and the spirit gave three
raps.
Jonathan leapt from the table, an~d' in the height of his credulity,
said, "she was the devil." He afterwards begged pardon fo~ the
impolite expression he had used, but expressed his intention 'to
examine the table. After a few exciamatiokis from some of th.
young ladies, who were present, how wonderful it was, he pro-
ceeded with the search. He found no hidden springs, nor arty crack
or crevice to elucidate the mystery, for a mystery it was to' 'him,
how that tall creature, who was called a medium, could know bi~

-tfather's name. It was not without a little' compunction, that ha
consented to seat himself again at the table, which having done, he
was desired to say, whether he wished to hold any tdther coxnmu-
v~iieation with the spirit?'
"Mr Oldbuck was by no means a brave man, and his face rather
blanched, as the thought flashed across his mind, that he was hold-
ing communication with the spiritual world. He begged to be
excused, and remarked, "that he seemed.to be taking up too much
of the spirits' time, that there were other persons in the room, who
might wish to communicate." They all said, "go on with ]~r
Old buck," and in spite of his wishes to the eputrary, the spirit again
~found, him with pencil and paper in hand, ready to hold further
Jutercourse. Mr Oldbnck expressed his wish, that the communicant
~in the ether. world should tell him in what relation he sto~kl towards
.liim, where he died, and how he was, ~t present?
Having, gone through the same process of writing, all the different
'~degrees of relationship~ and several names of* cities and towns, the
spirit 'was again to signify his assent to the truth, by giving the
~same number of raps as ho did ~on the first 'occasion.
Jonathan proceeded boldly to the task, ahd when he came. to the
~word "father," three distinct raps were again heard~ On this ~cca.

~J~nt expressed his determination to leave. 'He teaUy was alarmed!
'p~ud he stared with his large goggle eyes at Miss Clarissa, until she
did not know what to make of him.
~Time passed on, whilst the spirits were holding communications
,with the other persons in the room, in some of which they gave
~qorrect answers to the questions,. that were put to them, ,a~rd ig
others they did not, but they left a strong impression on the minds
~f all, that they were knowingg un's at least, and on none more so
,~than on Mr Jonathan Oldbuck, who' indulged, in several exelama-
,~tions of astonishment, "at the wonderful spirit of the age."
As for his' friend Ned Hammersley, he was too much ~taken up
with corporeal substances, to think a~ great deal about the spirit
'world,, and Clarissa was an~dous, to leave, as~ she thought Mr Old-

lie had hardly closed the door, when another loud peal of laughter
rang through every room in the house.
The mother shortly afterwards returned, and she had hardly time
to take off her bonnet, before Clarissa came running into the parlor,
and said:-
~' Mama, what do you think, that ugly old fellow, Oldbuck, has
been here, frightening m~ out of my wits."
"Why, what has he done, deat ?"
"He threw himself on ibis knees, and wouldn't leave me, uni~il I
said I loved him. I. couldn't say so, Mama, for I hate the ugly old
x~nonster. What impertinence, indeed, I'm sure I've never given him
any cause to believe thati love him."
"You accepted his candies, dear."
"I know I did'but I'm sorry for it now~ 0 dear me, I'm so happy,.
I did not sit for my Daguerreotype 'for him, he wanted me so much
to do so."
"What answer did you give him, &amp;larissa ?"
I told him you would give him my answer, this evening, and
you can tell him, for-me, that sooner than marry him, I would go
to my grave. I shall not come into the room, should he call here a
hundred times, and if I meet him in the street, I shall not speak to
him."
Anxious as Mrs Shr~wsbury may have been to provide a suitable
match for her daughter, she knew too well those qualities in men,
which inspire love, not to know, that Jonathan Oldbuok possessed
none of them. In her eyes, he was 'repulsive for his surpassing
t~gliness, and she could not- but believe, that Clarissa labored under
the same impression. She did not wish to offend him, bu1~ she made
up her mind to tell him once for all, that he could have no hopes in.
that quarter.
Mr Oldbuck called according to appointment in the evening, he
found Mrs Shrewebury seated alone in the parlor. She relieved him
from the necessity of making known the object of his visit, for lie
bad hardly been ~eated a few moments on 'the sofa alongside of her,..
when she said
"Mr Oldbuck, I heard from my daughter, that during my absence'
this afternoon, you had solicited her ~nd in marriage, and she very
properly referred you to me. Being~ her natural guardian, I think
you might at first have expressed your intentions to me, before
speaking with her on such a delicate subject."
Mrs Shrewsbury was rather offended at his oversight, and she
took good care to let him know, that she knew more ox~ the subject
than he did. She had said nothing yet to raise or crush his hopes,
so Mr Oldbuck remarked
"Pardon me, madam, for having been guilty of an error, in not
telling you first how deeply I live your daughter; I perfectly adore-

IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.
her, and she says you are to seal my happiness or misery now and
forever."
"I have no doubt, Mr Oldbuck, that it is a cruel alternative, but
having conferred with my daughter on the subject, I will give you
her answer, 'It is that she cannot marry you.'"
Poor Jonathan Oldbuck's face relaxed in its rotundity, it oeoame
so elongated, that it seemed as if it had gone through a rolling-mill,
and s~ deep was his emotion, that he could hardly call up sufficient
presence of mind to ask Mrs Shre~vsbury, what was the reason? At
length he did so, begging of her at the same time to be candid and
conceal nothing from him.
The mother assured him, "that she never practiced any evasion4,
but she would prefer his not pressing the question~"
"Pray tell me, Oh, do, I am prepared for the worst, but if by any
act of devotion during the remainder of my life, I could gain your
daughter's love, I would willingly perform it."
"It's impossible Mr Oldbuck, no act of yours could remove the
impediment, which nature has thrown in the way."
"What is it, do for heaven's sake tell me
She whispered gently into his ear, you're too ugly."
Poor Jonathan Oldbuck took his hat and left the house.

from Mr Oldbuck's absence. As for Ned Hammersley he paid visits
occasionally at the house, and took long walks with Mrs Shrews.
bury. She received no more letters from her husband, and wondered
why he did not write to her. Towards spring, she pleaded indispo-
sition, as an excuse for going to the country, leaving Clarissa in.
charge of the house during her absence. On her return, she looked
thinner than when she left, and her delicate state of health was the
source of anxious solicitude to her daughter,, who wished to call in.
a medical attendatit, a step, to which the mother was decidedly op-
posed. Hammer~ley was unremitting in his attentions, and the
" California widow" seemed to appreciate them as much as ever.

TUE "GRISETrEs" AND COUTURIERESS" OF FARIS-.NEEDy NEIGHBORS
-~THE BEGfl~NING OF ANOTHER INTRIGUE-MARGUERITE GERBOIS.
PARIs, the scene of intrigues, pleasures, and. love, the great whirl.
pd&amp;I 'which swallows up innocence and youth, virtue and integrity,
and where Vic~ lies at the bottom, which is stirred up now and tlien
to afford variety to the scene. The city of grisett~s and blondes, of
princesses and duchesses, and where men have most opportunity of
'consulting their tash~s for "wine, wit, and Woman," it was decidedly
th~ nib
bUnk's at agreeable spot on~ earth to repair to, after Jonathan Old-
numerous vexations' and disappointments on this side of the
Water.
A f~w months had elapsed since his last amours, during which
time he had bcen devoting his leisure hours to the stndy of French,
when one afternoon, after dinner, 'he expressed a wish to his mother
to travel, to ~ee a' little of th~ world, which the latter readily agreed
to, Saying that her dear departcd~husband had improved his mind so
much by seeing so n~i'any countries', that ho had been from Noya-
Zernbla to the Cape of'Good Rope, that he had danced with the Pin-
landers, and Bi~n6ked pipes with the' CalVres, and 'thai his conversa-
tion was so interesting, that he was' courted and admired by all who
knew him.
"Mama, why didn't you tell me so before? I'm sure that from
having remained all my life in the little town of New Bedford, I've
been denied many opportunities of improving my mind, and I think
it's high time that I should L~egin to do so."
"You're young yet, my boy; and your father did not begin to
travel until he was older than you are."
Jonathan appeared rather incredulous of what his mother had
told him, particularly as he was turi~ing fifty years of age, so he
resolved to set out on his journey without delay. His travelling
appointments were soon arranged, and having engaged a berth in
one of the .Uavre steamers, he bid adieu to his mother, not without
feeling bitter regret at his separation from one who had always given
him such good advice.

IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.
It was the first time that Jonathan had been at sea, and the
weathe~ being rather tempestuous, he could not at first account for
that peculiar sensation which he experienced; but the storm con.
tinuing, he gave visible demonstration of what was the matter with
him. He wa's sea'.sick, and such was the nature of the malady
under which he labored, that the more he eat the more he found ho
could not contain what he had eaten.
"'Call the doctor! I'm dying, I tell you (I'm dying !" he cried
out so lustily in the agony he experienced, that' the waiters
looked on him with sheer pity, and whilst they were tellW~g him he
would soon get better, he exclaimed, "I'm getting worse !~ Oh, my
mother, my dear mother !"
The storm lasted four days, and such was the shock to his sys.
tem, which had not 'become enured to the incidents of a sea voyage,
that he remained iu'bed during the rest of the passage.
From Havre to Paris he was not long in making the journey~ and
in less than three weeks after his departure from the empire city,
he had taken lodgings in ~one of the numerous HoteiPgarnis hi the
Faubourg Saint Jacques.
Life in Paris has its pleasures and its sorrows; there is so much
to attract the attention of a stranger as he is promenading along
the Boulevards, or even the Citausee d'Antin, that time flies with
the speed of an arrow. Whether, he studies human nature in the
vicinity of the splendid mansions of the Faubourg Saint Antoine,
or amongst the humbler dwellings of the 'Rue des Mathu#ins, at
every step he takes he sees striking examples of wealth and poverty,
and of virtue and vice. Human nature is the same every where,
but in no place is it so much diversified as in the gay saloons and
more humble places of resort of the bourgeoisie of 'Paris. We shall
not follow our hero through all the adventures he ha~d in the gay
capital, nor shall we stop to inquire how much he admired the ob-
jects of 'art, which every where struck his attention, but it will be
interesting, after the knowledge we have of his peculiar weakness
in his relations with the fair sex; to see whether his visit to la belle
France, contributed to give him that strength of mind which would
render him more able to resist their temptations.
Jonathan had learned a little French, but not sufficient to make
himself acquainted with the art of conversation. He could parlor
Prancais, and had gone pretty well through the past! and present!
tense of the verb aimer (to love), but the future he had yet to learn;
he could say, .Je vous ainze and J'ai aim6, but as for the future,
wl~ether the word was too long for him to pronounce, or. he had not
come to that part in the grammar, it's~ impossible to say, but he
knew nothing about it.
When strangers arrive in a foreign country, 'and are not ac-
quainted with the language, the first words they find it useful t~
know ~re those by which they asks for their food, but with Jonatham

it ~was othei~wise, aud' h~ admired the perspicuity of the grammarian
~ taught his pupils to conjugate the word airner, asthe first
lesson in the verbs.
At the Hotel wh~re Mr. Oldbuok resided, there was a number of
apartments occupied by bachelors and families, none of whom were
blessed with a superabundance of the comforts of life.' They be-
longed chiefly to the middle classes, who found it more economical
to live in hired lodgings than in houses of their own. There
was one family living on the same floor as Mr Oldbuck, rather
reduced in circumstances; they evidently appeared to be more
respeotabte than the persons who are usually found in a second-
rate hotel in the .Faubourg Saint Jacques. One of the little boys
belonging to the family, was in the habit of coming into Mr Old-
buck's room to borrow severe[ things, i~ow a little sugar, then a
little pepper, until Jonathan began to discover that his loans, though
not extensive, were so often repeated, that they would add a con-
~iderable expense to his weekly ~bills. He began to remonstrate
against his £travagance, and was ahnost' inclined to refuse
the little fellow When he came again, but one afternoon he acci-
dently met a young lady in the passage, who had just come out of
'his neighbor's toom, and this event, which might be so pregnant
with consequences, whether for weal or woe to Mr Oldbuck. made /
him alter his intentiOn.
The next time the little gamin came into the room to ask if he
had same fuel to spare for their fire, ~whioh was just going out,
Jonathan loaded him with an armful; that would supply the family
for a week. He began ~to interrogate the young messenger, but as
his knowledge of French did not extend to the hard words in the
language, he had to supply them with English, making such a jar-
gon, that n~ one could understand him.
"Fot~&amp;s padez Anglais"-the little boy shook his head.
"Vous .know la flUe in the chambre"-he nodded affirmatively
this time.
Jonathan took out a big 4ictionary, and in his desire to know the
relationship of the young lady to his youthful mes~e~1ger, went
through the whole category from mother down to second eunsins.
He asked-
"Est elle your mere, sceur, tante, cousin-germaine, or petite-
~ousine ?"
The little boy did not understand him, so he ran oqt and brought
his-father in ~to speak with the gentleman. The former was not
more conversant with English than the latter was with French, so
after seeing the difficulty in which he was placed, with that
natural politeness, so characteristic of Frenchmen, he. bowed himself
oi4 of the. room.
The next day the little boy beckoned Mr. Oldbuck to follow him
Auto his father's room, whete he was formally introduced to the

i~{SEAUt~II OF A WIFE.                 85
several members of the family, through the intervention of a young
lady who was present, and understood a little English. The
daughter of Oldbuok's neighbor was all smiles and cot rtesy when
she understood that Jonathan intended to occupy the apartments
some time longer, and therewas a general feeling of joy (lepieted
on the countenances of all, when they heard that there was a likel~i-
hood to have such a generous neighbor ne~ar them.
As there were three Parisian belles in the room, and they were all
more or less remarkable for beauty, Jonathan's heait was floating
about on a sea of perplexity as to which he should choose. He
wished much to have another flirtation, and as he had heard a great
deal about intrigues and liaisons with ladies 9f the gay metropolis,
he fancied he could trim his sails to such advantage, as to arrive at
last at the goal of his aspirations.
The fair interpreter was of great use to him, and as it was evi-
dent from his limited knowledge of French,' he 'could not get along
very well without her, he paid the most assiduous attention to' her.
Miss Monmorand, for that was the young lady's name, who occupied
apartments in Mr. Old buck's neighborhood, appeared rather jealous
that Marguerite Gerbois should be more the object of his admiration
than herself, and never 'regretted anything so much in her life, as
her ignorance of the English language.
The following dialogue took place between Mr. Oldbuck arid Miss
Gerbois, in which the former's limited knowledge of' French,
and the latter's imperfect acquaintance with English, ma~$e them
use a phraseofogy, which was almost unintelligible to Englishmen
or Frenchmen.
"Ma chere, Miss," said Jonathan, "voulez vous assure Made-
moiselle Mqnmorand, que ~e serai tres," (he hesitated, and could not
remember the French word for "glad,") content de ~lui donner, all
that she wanjs, no matter what it is. Xe serai always pret to serve
young ladies who already began to understand him thoroughly,
first chuckled, then la4hed out loud at Mr Oldbuek's devotion to
Miss Monmorand; he did not understand what they meant, for
whilst he thought that he had been offering them what his "hou~o
and home" contained, they believed it was something tantamount to
a declaration of love on his part.
Miss Gerbois replied, "the family are very reconnoissant to you
for all your politesse, and will be tres content a voue
Jonathan smiled and bowed acquiescence, for he wished to culti-
vate their acquaintance, in order to make himself more proficient in
French. He said,
"Mademoiselle Gerbois, will you tell Miss Lucie, that when she

of thc future tense of the verb aimer (to' love), but which was not
used in that sense here, thought Lucie said that she loved him very
well. And he replied, "tell her, I am tres fier, (very proud) of the
preference she shows me."
Lucie agaii~ found his words incomprehensible, and when Miss
Gerbois explained them to her, became rather indignant, that he
should' 'be so explicit in his declarations before so many persons.
The conversation was at length brought to an end., by the diffi.~
oulty which all seemed to experience to understand each other, but
between Jonathan and Miss Gerbois, there arose quite an intimacy,
and' as she and another young lady, who was with her were ahout
leaving, Jonathan proposed to escort them home, an offer, which
they willingly accepted.

in his devotions at your shrine than Jor~athan Oldbnck, who wor.
shipped'yon with a veneration, that; has never been equalled by any
other mortal. His prayers were not propitious in the land of his
birth, and he had travelIe~I far and wide, to see if he could make.
any other offerings at the altar of tbi fickle god, but Ou~id appeared
to be no friend of his, for he thwarted every effort to consummate
)iis wishes. Whether in the humble mansion in street, or
iu the still humbler apartments of the sewing girl, in the Rue de la
.Z~nssardzere, there was an evil influence at work, that; foiled all
hj~ plans, and counteracted all his efforts, to leap beyond the chasm,
t1l~t separates the si ogle from the married state. He thought he
w~s;doorned to disappointment, and was resolved to try once niore
to change~ his condition. "I shall have one -more trial," said he,
"and if I do not succeed, I shall return to America and live there
in the quiet and seclusion of a bachelor's life. I shati trouble mysel(
n~ longer about the fair sex, and aflow those who have neglected
and spurned my offers, to live in ~he eonsciousrwss of the wrongs
they' have done me, and regret how little they appreciated my per.
BQnal charms."
~{e returned to his lodgings, where he found the little boy waiting
at ~his dooi,. to asI~ him to lend his mother cinq francs, and she would
return it to him the next morning.
This request awakened Jonathan from the reveries of love and
~omance to the more sober realities of life, for he thought to him~
self, that his neighbors became more extravagant in their demands,
and that Ahey were making heavy calls on his purse. The door
was a~j~r, and the 8ight of Lucie made him come to a decision sooner
than he would have done, for~he took out his purse and handed the
boy a~ flyefranc piece.
He, h~ad not been long in the room, when the little fellow again
entered, and asked him for the loan of some vinegar. Jonathan in
hi ~annoyance at their frequent requests, handed him the cruet-
stai~id, and told him to take it with him~n, thinking by that means he
w~u1d ~et rid of at least some of their importunities.
He little thought, that~ his highly appreciated generosity would
ozily add new zest to their desire to get all they could out of him,
~4 i~ was x~ot long before the fair Lucie herself came to the door as
~ lztzmble supplicant on his bounty and benevolence.

OW OOURTsmP-REFLEOTIONS OF JONATHAN OLDBUOK ON THE 5TA~T1t OF
XIS ~FINAN0E5-~-U(VOOATION TO MONEY.
OLDBUCK dreamt all night about Mademoiselle Marguerite, her
image was never out of his thoughts. On the following morning
he went out ,a walking in the rue de la Poissardiere, he did not
wi~h to call 'on :Miss aerbois so soon, too much precipitation, might
appear ridiculous, but he would at all events walk in the same
!street and breathe* the same air as she did, for there was at least.
'soifle satisfaction in that.
The street was long, the houses were generally of four or flyer
stories, and there wel'e but few porters, from whom he could mak~
inquiry as 1~o Mrs Gerbois' residence. He was at a lots to find it oju1~,
for although he had taken notice of the house~ all the buildings.
were so much alike, that he might easily mistake it.
He stopped on the steps of a house and was about knocking for
admission, when looking up to see if he was not wrong, an
woman opened a window in the third story and threw out a ~ail-.'
full of dust and rubbish, which falling on Jonathan, got. through~ his
spectacles~and almost blinded him As for his clothes, they were ~
much bespattered With some~elimny substance, that he thought they~
were ruined, and was almost ashamed to walk through the str~ets.
of Paris in that dirty condition.
This is enough for to-day, thought 'Jonathan'; I ought to be more-
careful, as to how I note the re~id~enoe of: my friends, however, I~
shall easily find it out to-morrow~
On the folloWing morningJiinatlian was more careful than usual
his toilet, took his hat and cane and proceeded in the direction ci'
the rue de la Poissardiere. He at length found the house, whe#e'
the ladies lived, but did not rem$friber the panioular floor, on which~
-were their apartments. Oldbuck ascends a dark stair-case, and.
decides on knocking at a door in the second 'story.
An old woman in a short gown, who had ~it least four handker..-
chiefs on her head, opened the door for Oldbuok, who asked her icr"
.M'adame Geri.ois, that lives hero with her two nieoes.

"It's not here, Sir."
Jonathan did not understand her very well, but he knew they
lived in that house.
"What do thiy do ?" asked the old woman.
Jonathan seemed to understand her, for he made use of the word
~couturiere, which the old woman understood and beckoned with her
hand that they lived up stairs.
Jonathan. found out his mistake, for going up stairs he knocked
at the door, which was opened by Marguerite herself. On enter~

Marguertte was very kind and considerate in her attentions to
~Mr Oldbnek, and entertained him for some time with the numeroi~s
'littIe~repartees, with which French girls are so familiar. All the
time they were~ in conversation, the cousin, ~ho had last entered,
appeared to be growing more impatient, and at length made a sign
to Mr Oldbuck's belie, which she immediately understood. Beg-
ging him to excuse her for a few moments, she followed Gustave
(for that was his nam4 into the adjoining room, the door ~f which
~she closed.
Jonathan did not know what to think about it, and went to the
window, which looked out on the yard belonging to the building,
with his mind in a state of perplexity, oven as to the oharaoter of
the persons with whom he ld been thrown into communication;
but his doubts we~re dispelled by what he k~ad been able to pick up'
in French from L~cie about her friends, the Gerbois, and the
frank open manner of the girls themselves. He was resolved, how-
ever, to make further inquiries about their relatives, &amp;o., and
doubted not that all his apprehensions would be removed on that
score, by what Lucre would tell him, he even ~reproached himself
for entertaining suspicions which might be groundless, and thought
~at. la~st'~hat he had been doing injustice to the girls.
)$I4rguerite remained a few minutes in, the ~ooai with ber cousin,
and coming out, begged Mr Oldbuck to excuse her for hbr rude~
x~esa in having left him, at the sama time assuring himthat she had
yery pre~i~ng b~isiziess to transact with Gust~ve, wh&amp; was ~oiug to
the ~oixntry in the morning. * The latter seemedto understand the
impoi~t of v~at Marguerite was telling Mr. Oldbuok, 'for. he smiled'
ajid put on sueh a pleasingair, that entirely conciliated him~ 'Th~e~two
cousins left' together, and Jonathan was not ~at~ all 4i~pleased' that ho
was alone with Marguerite and the other girL
ilad Jonathan been left with Marguerite alone, he would no doubt'
have trie~1 to practice a little familiarity also with' the girl, bu~
there is no saying, as his natural reserve and respect for, the' female I;
sex wpuld forever prevent him from going beyond th~ bounds which
courtesy prescribed. He never regretted anything so much 'in his
life, that he' was not one of the cousins also, for the 'smack which
~e~rge.&amp; had given to the pretty little grisette, still rang in his ears,
and he could not forget it. He did! make an attempt to take h~J.dt
of Marguerite's hand, to admire one of th9 rings she wore, hut
having pressed it rather too tightly, she hastily withdrew it;' giving
him at "the same time a look which h&amp; did not much like. Pcox~

went on in his old way to the affections of his Parisian ac.
quaintanee. He did not remain long after the cousins left, but~
promised ~to 'return on the following day with Lu.~ie, to take them a~
walking. In the 'meantime he would make further inquiries and
ascertain all about them.
'On his return to his lodgings, he was not ~loncr in being thrown
'in communication with his neighbors, for scarcely an hour or tw&amp;
elapsed during the day, without they called to borrow something
or other from their obliging friend.
An opportunity soon presented itself, for Lucie came bounding
into the room to ask for three centimes, which she knew Mr Oldbuck
'would readily 'give her, as their pr~yio~s demands had been for
fr&amp;ncs ' This put Jonathan in a g~1 humor, for their loans were
becoming more moderate, and he took advantage of her being with
him, to ask her eox~iething about her friends the Getbois.
There was living on the same floor a young student, who had
a smattering of English, and Lucie ran and asked him for his
assistance,~ to come and 'tell her what Mr Oldbuck was saying to
her. A pale thin young man soon made his appearance to act as
translator for them.
"Will you' tell Malemoiselle Lucie," said Jonathan, "that t
want to"k~aow something about 'the Gerbois, who they are, and what.
is their' f~niily ?"
The young man told her, and she began their genealogy, which,
for augbt he kn'ew~ 'might ~ve n'~ounted up to the Capets and
* Oharletwiagnes ~of Prench history, for she mentioned several families,
the~names ~f'whioh were'familiar to Jonathan, as being those of seve-
ral of 4he leading' families of France~ - He had seen th~ names in'
the newspapers 'and vas rather surprised ~to find that his new ac-
quaintanoes were allied to such a noble stock. Entertaining,
however, home srispioions 'of their legitimacy, he' pushed his in-
cjniries ~ 'little further, and asked how they themselves stood in
society? ' ' '~
Lucie replied! that they occupied an excellent position, and were
courted and admired for' their rnann0rs and behavior.
'Jonathan appeared delighted a't the revelation, but not wishing to
lose such a good ~pj~oriuoity of hearing more about them, he asked.
*hat character the girls bore themselves?
Lucie ask0d what he meant?
Mr Oldbnck said that he wished to know if they bore good cha$~.
actors, that is to say, if they were virtuous.
Ltu~ie's ey~te inflamed like those of a perfect' virago, they seemed.

Whether Jonathan was afraid that the claws df the angt~y~
Py Lhohess would soon be tcansfi*ecl to his eyes~ ~r of having gone
too 'far, it is impossible to say, but he began a series of apologies,
which was almost as long as Lucie's genealogy of the aerbois
family.
Recrimination ceased, as much on account of Lucie's inclinatida
not to offend her generous friend, as from Jonathan's desire to stand
well in her opinion. He expressed his regret for having thrown out'
the slightest insinuation against the honor and high standing of the
Gerbois.family, and almost begged of 'Lucie, on his knees, not t~
say a ~ord to them of what had occurred. Thus matters stood;
an~1 Mr Oldbnck Was in a state of anxiety as to whether he 1i~d
offefided his neighbors or not, until the&amp; had renewed the agreeable
relations subsisting between them, by asking him for the loan of' a~
little Wine, as one ~f the childreti had been t~ken ill.
Jofathan gave them the bottle, at the satrte time doul5ting lii lziu
rriind, whetherr wine was a 'good specific for '~hildreii,' but he would
have willinglyy given thetn anything h~ had, to propitiate 'the frie~d~
of Ma~guerite Gerbois.
On the following day he begged of Lucie to aec&amp;np~ny h~n~
there, a~ he had promised them 'to go 'out a-walking, "which Luc~
readily agreed to, and taking but litt1~ tirr~e to put on her bonU~t
and shawl, they proceeded in, the dir~tion of the Rice de ,i~
Pd~ss4rdiere. They found. the girls ~t home, bdt this ti~ie witk~
oi*t any cousins, and Oldbuck's counteitance beamed with joy~t
receiving such a hearty welcome from the fair Marg4erite. '1k'
th6n~ht hi~ hopes were almost realized, and from the &amp;ff~ble 'n1~u~

They went out and visited several t'e*taurants where they wei~'i'

in "his ~eutu~u~s,' that frightful inroads were being made o~ his piir~.

asked twice as much for it~ as it was worth, and- the bargain was
concluded by Mr Oldbuck's paying down thirty dollars for the first
prq~ent he had given his belle. His generosity did not stop here,
for~ somehow or other Lucie had forgotten her purse, an omission
which Mr Oldbud would have fain attributed to accident, so of
course, before liftcsrguerite and her cousin, he could not do other-
wise than defray the bill, which amounted only to the small sum of
seven dollars.
The walk was concluded very much t6 the pleasure, and at the

gratified at the marks of attention, which Margherite had shown
h~ixi, but somewhat displeased at the suni of money he had spent.
He was not a. man of, much means, and he was afraid that his.
expenses were becoming so great, that he would have hardly
enough money left to pay for his wedding, and bring his bride to
America.
This was a consideration, which he had almost overlooked, and
when he returned to this lodgings, he begaa seriously to reflect on
his extravagance. 1~ere was another difficulty, which he had never
foreseen; on ~qr~nting overhis n~oney, he found he had only about two
hundred and fifty dollars left, a sum, which he thought inadequate

avuched forth into an outburst of passion at his reoklessness~ and
pr~dioted all sorts o~' horrors at the position, in which he might b~

EW YORK.

THREE weeks had elapsed, and Oldbuck had been a constant
~Asitor at the 0-erbois apartments, so much so, that Margueritef
u~lways became anxious to see him, when seven o'clock arrived and
he had not made his appearance. Since that eventful day on which
118 had been introduced to the "cousins," he had not seen a solitary
pair 4of breeches about the premises, which was a matter of satis-
faction to a person of Jonathan's suspicious turn of mind. 'It is true
he had not been there in the day time, for .Marguerite, on the plea~
of some other pressing engagements, 'said her time was so much
occupied, that he must always calVin the evening, when he would
be sure to see her. Jonathan~was so far pleased with this arrange.
ruent, that it afforded him su0icient time to see the lions of Paris,
an agreeable sight for a stranger, and particularly for one who had
spent the greater part of his life, in a small town of New England.
One evening, Mr Oldbuck started from his residence in the Fau.~
bourg Saint Jacques to the Rue de la Poissardiere, with the full
deteriiiination of soliciting Marguerite's hand in marriage. There
had been no precipitation in this case, for Jonathan had gone step
by step, until he thought he had insinuated himself so completely
in the fair grisette's affections, that he could safely claim her as hia
bride.
'Hither therefore he repaired, and found Marguerite never looking
so charming and lovely, nor her conversation so lively and interest-
ing. After remaining about an hour in her company, he told her,
that he h~d come that evening for the express purpose of hearing
from her own lips, the doom which was to consign him to everlast-
ing happiness or misery, that she could not fail to observe, how deep
was his love for her, and that he wished to know, whether shewould
become his wife?
When Jonathan. made this declaration, which was rather familiar
to him from his long practice in such matters, he was seated near
Marguerite, who at first blushed or rather orimsoned to the eyes,
she then to6k her handkerchief, an4 affected to wipe away a tear~

hanging in a position of the moat delightful abandon ovor Mr OWr
buck's left shoulder. She gently, (oh ! how sweetly did th~ wdrd
sound on the ear of her enraptured ad~nirer) pronounce&amp; that
monosyllable, "Yes," whi~h bomid her to him hencefor ard by tfr~
solemn ties of a, matrimonial engagement.
A thought struck 1~targuerit~, (but it was by t at~ought), f~r
sh~e had no intention of withdrawing her promise, that if she ~
ed some desire to make herself better a9qu~ir4ed with Mr Qid~
buck's family and antecede~its, it might give him a better op~uon
of her good faith, and strengthe~i his deterrninatior~ to, marry her.
~o she begged of him to rela1~c tq her all about his birth and parent-
age, at the same time begging him to pardon her, but intimating,
that her aunt would be more satisfied,'if she ki~ew her niece was to
be allied with, a family equally as respectable as her ow~i.
Jonathan Oldbuek recapitulated all, with which th9 reader i~.
acquainted, omitting however several passages in his past life, which.
he would not for 'the world have said anything about to Mar-'
guerite. Th~ latter went out of th~ room for a few monients to
confer with her aunt, end on her return expressed herself satisfie&amp;
with his explanation and told him, she had her aunt's consent to
the marriage. Jonathan took the rosettete on his knees? threw his
long sinewy arms around her delicate waist, and implanted a kie~~.
on her cheeks, which filled his so with rapture. The aunt herr
,, self shortly after made her appearance, and calling Marguerite to7
her, whispered sorrlething in her ear, which her niece assented to.,
Before Jonathan left that night, the grisette threw out a ger4~
hint, that they were rather reduced iz~ means, an~ that 4L~p
afraid, she would not be able to have a very extravaga~it troussec~u~
on which Jonathan, of course, with that exuberant~ gen~rQ~ij~y for.
which he was remarkable, took out oi'~'his pirse' a fifty dollar biW
andhanded it to his fiancee~. Her eyes ~list9ned~with delight at th~
sight of so much money, and another kiss rewarded the liberaht~4
of 'the donor. The wedding day was fixed, and Wed~iesda~r of th~
following week was to seal the fate of Jonathan Oldbuck andco4~,
stitute him a Benedict.
During his walk ho~ne that night, Mr Oldbuck 'revelled in all
the anticipations of his future happiness. At length he had reach-'
e4 th~ goal of his fondest, desires, he was to take 'a partner to his
bosom, who was every way worthy of his name a~n4 family. Sh~
was the personi4~cation of all that was lovely and amiable ~i~i liei'
sex, and 'would be, wiien she arrived in America, the cynos~urc,
around which all eyes would be fixed, admiring her grace an~
beauty. What would his mother say, that dear mother, who
watched all' his youthful days with suqji anxiety, and attended: h4~i.
with so much care when he should present her with a daughter-in-'
law, ccrnbining so many attractions of mind and person.
~rneasure of, his blips was indeed full to overfiQwing, and Jonathan.

Oldbuck ran wild in his contemplation of the happiness, that was
in store for him.
Ris dreams that night were of a delightful grove in Arcadia,
where there was one presiding Deity clothed in garments of purple
and silver, whose brow was radiant with beams of effulgence and
glory, and that he alone was a worshipper at her feet, receiving her
rewards and the oL(ject of her smiles. Oh! how pleasing was the
reverie of his midnight hours, not more so however, than his
thoughts by day, for they were engrossed with all that related to
his fair .?ifarguerite, whom he loved and adored.
On the following day and indeed during the whole time, which
intervened before his wedding, he was occupied in making prepara-
tions for the approaching solemnity; and what with his frequent
visits to tailors, and shoemakers, and the hours he spent with his
beloved, the days passed away, and time was flying with a celerity
which hurried him on to the most important epoch in his life.
Sunday came, a day which most people devote to religious pur-
poses, but which many spend in gossipping and talking. Since
Jonathan knew, that his neighbor, the student, understood a little
English, he had cultivated his acquaintance and became rather
familiar with him. Alphonse do Very was a fine young man, he
was kind and affectionate, and when he formed an intimacy with.
any one, looked upon him as a friend, aiid took a deep interest in his
welfare. He was a student for one of the learned professions, and
as he was rather destitute of the means of living, .devoted his
leisure hours to writing for the fruilletons of the press. This made
"It necessary for him to become acquainted with the "in's and out's"
of society, the secret springs, which keep the body politic in motion,
and which require oiling jxow and then to make things go on
smoothly. He kne* every person and every thing, and was a por-
table biography of every one's life, services, and actions. So he
knew all abbut th~ Gerbois' and when that fatal Sunday arrived,
on which Jonathan expressed to him his intention of marrying and
solicited his services as groomsman, he was thunder-struck at the
frightful chasm, into which his friend was leaping. He at first
pitied him,' then burst out in a fit of the loudest laughter.
Jonathan asked him what he meant? -,
"What I mean," said Alphon~se do Very, "why, that you will
disgrace yourself by such a Qonnection."
Mr Old buck drew himself up to his full length. Marguerite wa~
~the embo~lirnentof virtue and excellence, she was allied with the
most noble families of France, and if he dared to say another word
to her prejudice, he would consider it as a personal affront, and take
vengeance on the spot.
Alphonse do Very ,burst out into another almost hysterical fit of
laughteft
"Good God! what~ does this mean ?" said Mr. Oldbuok.

"It means," said Alphonse, "that Marguerite aerbois is a ~irl
of the town, she has long been noted for her vicious habits, and I
regard you too much as a friend, to allow you to be deceived any
longer, and think it my dnty to put you on your guard against con-
tracting any such alliance."
Jonathai~ stride up and down the room with the pace of a giant,
his face was blanched, his teeth were chattering, and his whole
frame evinced ihe most sensible signs of emotion. "Give me some
proofs," said he to Alphonse, at the same time shaking the young
man with all his strength, "or I will challenge you to mortal
combat, for the injury you have done to my affianced bride."
Alphonse de Very would have left the room, and Mr Oldbuck to
the fate which awaited him, but a feeling of benevolence prevented
the young man from leaving his acquaintance on a precipice from
which, in one leap, he would have been consigned to perpetual
infamy. "Proofs," said he~ "come with me this afternoon, now,
if you please, and I will give you snch evidence of her perfidy and
vice, that you cannot be mistaken."
"This afternoon-no, this very moment," said Oldbuck," or I
will wring -.-."
Alphonse observed, "You need not again get, into a passion, Mr
Qldbuek, but I will undertake this very ~moment to convince you
that you placed your affections .on an object that is entirely un-
worthy of them. Come with me," said the young man, and both
hurried their steps to the Rue de la Poissardiere.
On their way thither, Alphonse met one of his friends, who spoke
English fluently, and whom he introduced to Mr Oldbuek, saying,
he wished him to accompany him. as a witness, to convince him
that he was telling the truth. The three arrived at the Gerbois
residence, where they were usjiered into the same room that was
inhabited by the old woman whom Jonathan had see~ii op a previous
occasion.   por          wine 1emme, sai Alph6nse, at the
"Comment     tez vous b     'i'"
same time directing his friend to translate to Mr Oldbuck, in Eng-
lish, what the old woman said in French.
~The substance of what she said was as follows: that she could
no longer live in the house, that the noiseon the floor immediately
above her was such, that she had no peace by day nor rest at night,
that for the last three weeks, between the hours of seven and ten,
or eleven at night, things were a little quieter, and that she availed
herself of that time to. take a little rest, but during the whole day
and remainder of the night, it was a constant thoroughfare for the
wildest and most debauched yo~ing men, that there was drinking,
singing, and dancing, and that for her 'part, she had almost made
up her mind to leave the house, for she had complained to the land-
lord, and he had taken no notice of her' remonstrances.
Jonathan~s face grew paler and paler, during the recital of this

+g


so                 JON ATH4N OLDRUOK
story, but being not y4 convinced, said to Alphonse, "the proofs~
the proofs, J want !"
"Is it
immediate that. you, want ?" said Alphonse; "you sh~ll hav8 them
see the ai~ZA~i~e met our friend Theodore Lavergue, on his way to
Marguerite, the virtuous and tender grisette. We
Miall go up stairs and pay them a visit, while you will look through
the key hole, and see your affianced bride in his arms, he wilt
implant a kiss on her cheeks, the sound of which you will hear
in the h a1l~ and if ~hat'5 not enough, I know not what you re-
q~zire."
"It will be enoi~gh, enough," said Jonathan, "and II shall b~
satisfiedd tha~t I have been the dupe of the vilest of her sex."
The threc proceeded up stairs, Alphonse and Theodore entering
the room, while Mr Oldbuck remained without, with his eye to the
key hole. His spectacles increased the magnitude of the sight which
he Witnessed, for there was his amiable and adored 1J1argz~erite, the
object of his love, and the cynosure around which all were to
assemble in admiration of her charms, in the arms of Theodore
Lav~rgne, who implanted a kiss on her cheeks, and ~ *
*    *     *    but we shall not remove the veil, which must for
e~rer conceal such sights from the public ~eye, but which fell on the
astonished vision of Jonathan Oldbuck, with frightful, almost alarm-
ing effect. Sitting on the floor, he leaned his head against the door
of the adjoining apartment, and when his friend Alphonse came out
of the room, found him so pale and Weak, that he was afraid he
wa~ going .1~o fall into a fit. Raising him up from the ground,
AAp'honse stipported him on his arm, amd brought him hpme to his
lodgings, where he was put to bed and remained confined for three
'weeks, with, a brain fever, which almost threatened his existence.
Alphonse remained as a faithful attendant at his bedside during the
whole of his illness, and often wondered what the man's antecedents
were, or what was his disposition, that he should be taken ill in
consequence4 of the unsuccessful termination of an affair of love.
Hjs must indeed be a very susceptible heart, thought Alphonse, that
is so easily impressed with the charms of the fair sex and he more
than o~ice regretted the necessity of imparting to his friend, what he
'Acnew about the Gerbois family.
Time is the assuager~of all evils, it alleviates man's sorrows,' and
if there has been any thing reprehensible, which he has done, makes
him ,regret his~'past conduct; but there is no period like that of
oonvalesenoe, when one's' reflcctiQns crowd on his mind, an ci he
-I~itterly repents his errors. Thus it was with Jonathan Oldbuck,
in the long dreary hours~ when his returning strength enabled him
'~ sit up in his bed with no attendant at his side,- for Alphonse's
duty called him away; he thotight how credulous he had been,

came into the room to borrow something else.
Jonathan's visage assumed a most frightful aspect, it went through
every contortion which ~could appear on the human countenance,
and the little boy r~n out of the room in wild alarm, crying out that
Monsieur Okibuck was dying. - The appearance of Lucie and her
father did not add to the patient's composure, and he gave vent to
the most violent expressions of anger, ordering them peremptorily
out of the room, and telling them he never wished to see their faces
again.
There is no misunderstanding a man, when he is in a passion, the
eyes proclaim what the lips may fail to tell, and the whole features.
announce an outburst of feeling, which can always be comprehended.
Lucie made her escape from the room, followed by her father, quite
at a loss to know what had ~stirred up her friend's- ire against them.
Had she understood Mr Jonathan Oldbuck's 'language, she would -
have heard the ~ilest epithets applied both to the - Gerbois and her-
self, imputing all his misery and the illness he had undergone, to
her base and infamous falsehoods about their genealogy &amp;nd descent.
At length he was able to leave his bed, and 2look about his affairs
preparatory to his - departure for New York. He had seen enough
-of Paris to convince him, that in leaving America he had not altered
his - condition for the' better, and he resolved on returning immedi-
ately to greet his mother and friends in the Empire City. The first
duty he performed, on rising from his bed' of sickness, was to make
out the aocounf against his neighbors, and present it to them for
payment. He found it amounted to upwards of forty dollars, a.-
trifling sum to be sure, but as his means were rather reduced from
the expenses attendant on his late illness,,~he wanted all that was
- due to him, lie sent the bill to the occupants of the adjoining
room, but no notice was taken of it, the second, third, and fourth -
day passed, and still the bill was not paid. He requested his 'friend
Alphonse de Yery to call on them and demand payment, which the
young man agreed to do.
Alphonse returned, followed I~ the father, who said, that he owed
Mr Oldbuck nothing, that his daughter Lucie was a couturier, who
was dependent for her livelihood on her needle, and that they had a
bill against Mr Oldbui~k, for his daughter's time, which he had

taken up, in requesting her to accompany him to the Gerbois. Old..
euck flew in a rage, the father threatened to have him taken before
- a .Tuge de Paix, for slander against his family, and there was a.
scene of mutual recrimination, in which Jonathan came to th~ very
wise decision, not to press the matter any further, and to put down
the loss to sundry expenses in the City of Paris.
The .Etavre packet was to sail for New York in a few days, and
before three weeks had elapsed, Jonathan placed his foot on the piers
of the-Empire City, with great joy at his release from the trials and
temptations~ of life in Paris, and resolved to be wiser for the future.                       CHAPTER XI.

JONATHAN OLDBTJOK
Wealth is like a load-stone, possessing powerful magnetic attrae.
tion, bvtt when it is combined with intelligence, old maids and
dowerlesss daughters flock around the owner, like flies in summer on
a plate of molasses.~ The latter, however, partake of sweets, whilst
the former, if they only had seen Mr Oldbuck, night have had their
'taste' so' much soured at the sight, that they would have envied
neither his wealth nor his intelligence. He had not improved ~n
his looks since his return, and his serious illness in Paris had
~shattered a constitution, whi6h age also was beginning to impair.
Ladies are however proverbial for their curiosity, and with some of
Xrs Oldbuck's acquaintances, it was almost diffiojilt to restrain
them from going up to. Mr Oldbu0k's room, to take a peep at her
eon. Jonathan was never remarkable for his beauty, although,
when dress added to the adornment of his person, he might have
been considered passable by some, but if the young ladies had gone
up in h~is room and seen him, unshaven, with his long blue morning
gown ~nd red slippers, they might have taken him for an apparition
from a other world, and stoo?1 aghast at the sight.
Jonathan Was beginning to get tired of this monotonous mode of
'living, so l~e frequented the coffee-houses and saloons oftener than
usual, un~l' his mother began to remonstrate with him on the late-
ness of the hour, at which he returned home, and advised him to
be more pruden* for the future.
One evening, Oldbuok strolled into a bowling saloon, in the vici-
nity of Ohatham square, where he became rather interested in the
sport. There was a young man, who was so expert in knocking
down the nine-pins, that he attracted Jonathan's attention, and he
was surprised to'find in the successful player the person of his old
rival, Charley Seagrave. They mutually recognized each other, and
it was ncTt long 'before they becarndb so friendly, that they took a
glass of brandy together at the adjoining bar. The conversation
soon turned about the Switzers, where Seagrave remembered he
was introduced to his fr~nd, and Jonathan was surprised to hear,
tb~at'his first love Louisa Switzer was the mother of two children
and likely to have a third. Seagrave. 'mentioned to him, how often
Louisa spoke to him of her old friend and admirer, Jonathan Old-
buck, and said that he was sure, no visit would afford~ her greater
pleasure than his, if.he would call upon her. Taking out a card and
pencil, he wrote his name and address, which was in Madison
street, No.-. Jonathan replied, he would have much pleasure
in calling on Mrs Seagrave.
Talk not of your palaces in the avenues, of those noble man-
sions, where their inmates are pampered with every luxury, that
wealth oaff'afford, where the favored' child of, fortune is brought up
by fond parents, who allow no wish to remain ungratified, nor no
bope to be unfulfilled. It is not there! in the midst of the splen-
'.dor, which surrounds you, with all those appliances, which human.

her desolate orphans, and it is there~ you will"see instances of
fortitude in dlstress'and of heroism ~mi1lst trials.
On the following morning Mr Oldbuck repaired to the pl&amp;oe,~
which had been indicated as 'Seagrave's residence, and found Louisa~
at home. Sh~ wa~ 'rriueh altered in her appearance, and he soaree~~
ly recognised her. The place and the furniture were so different
from that'whioh he had seen in her fathers 'house,' that he was at-
no loss to account forihe' change in her person. In 'tWo apartrra.ents
on the right Irand side of the 'hall, on the~ first floor, was the abode
of Charley Seagrave's wife' and 'children, for 'it could hardly be said
to be the' residence of the: husband; who spent his' 'days and nights'

our intimacy and marriage. Charley remained in his employment~
for some months after, earning six dollars a week, a sum, which
was quite adequate to our expenses, but when our family increased,
they became insufficient, and he left his place to go to another,
where~he was promised higher wages. From some cause or other,
he was not long in this employment, and although the failure to
receive his weekly stipend caused us some annoyance, we did not
at ~rst feel it, but weeks passed over and he got no place. I would
have taken in sewing, but he would not hearof it one; after the
other, however, of the few things we had, was sold to buy us our
food, and pay for the rent of these rooms; in all my distress, I then
never regretted my marriage with Charley, he was kind and affec..
tionate to me, and when he had the means, there was no wish of
mine that he did not gratify. He finally got a place, but was in it
~only three weeks, when he lost it again. I could not account for
the misfortune, but a few days after, the mystery was solved, for
any husband came into the room reeling in a state of intoxication,
~and here Louisa put her hands to her face, which became suffused
with tears.
Jonathan Oldbuck was not a man of much sensibility (excepting
in matters of love), he was rather hardhearted in all others, but he
could not withhold his' sympathy from the young mother, as she
Was detailing her wrongs and misfortunes. Intemperance is the
canker-worm which gnaws at the vitals of all who are its victims.
it degrades man from the position he might occupy in t~ie social
scale, and renders him unfit for the common offices and duties of
life. If its evils fell on his own head alone, there might be suffi~
cient punishment for the crime, but when they fall on the wife and.
mother, and on those who are least able to avoid them, the
latter become indeed fit objects for the charity and benevolence of
man. So thought Jjonathan, as he looked on the mother in afflic-
tion, withdier two babes at her side, deprived of their protector,
who was spending his days and nights at the drinking saloon!
He asked Louisa when she had last seen he~ husband, and she
replied that he scarcely ever came there, but when he did, would
throw a half dollar on the table, and'leave the house, without even
kissing the children, and here the young mother again burst forth
into the wildest expressions of grief.
Jonathan found that nothing ho could say, would console Louisa
in her afiliotion, btit he could do something, and that he did imme..
4iately, by taking his purse tout of his pocket, and handing her a
five dollar bill. At first she did not like to accept it, but when he
told her it was the grateful offering of an old friend,~ who would, for
the~ future, take pleasure in watching over the fate of herself ~nd
her babes, she took it with herr eyes glistening with joy.
"One favor," said Jonathan, "I must request of you; it is,

that. you will give no part of the money to your husband, for
he would only~ take it to the saloon and spend it in liquor."
"Indeed I shall not," said Louisa, "in fact he will not know
that I have it, and if he 'did, he would not get it."
Jonathan left, promising to return again shortly, with his mind
full of sad reflections on the vices of men, and the pitifull state to
which they ofttimes reduce the partners of their bosoms.
Did a solitary idea spring up in Jonathan's mind, that if Louisa
Switzer had married him, her fate would have been different? No,
there did not, for it was engrossed with the memory of what he had
just seen and heard, a picture of misery and a tale of woe, that
would move the heart of the most insensible. Could there be,
thought Oldbuck, a wretch in human form who would desert a
wife, who had always been faithful to him and her young children,
for the intoxicating pleasures of the cup; if there were, it were
better that poison were mixed in the baneful beverage, than that
4inother and an innocent person should suffer.
He returned home, and told his mother of what he had seen that
morning, and the old woman was quite afflicted at the narration.
She wanted to go and see her immediately, but when'Jonathan told
her that he had relieved her ,necessities for the present, she said,
"you did right, my boy, and heaven will bless you."
Jonathan continued to lead the same life he had done, since his
return from France, but would occasionally go out in the evening
to whxi~ away an hour or two at some of his favorite places of
resort. He had not seen Ned Hammersley since his return, and one
evening as he was walking in the park, espied his old friend with a
lady hanging on his arm, whom he had no difficulty in recognizing
as the fair Angelina herself, Mrs Augustus Shrewsbury, whose
trusting husband, he supposed, was still digging gold in California.
He would not salute him at that moment, for the sight of Mrs
Shrewsbury revived recollections, which he would fain have buried
in oblivion, but he resolved to call on him the following morning,
and talk about old times.
He went there the next day, and the greeting was cordial on both
sides.
"Well, Ned," said Jonathan, "how goes on the California
'widow ?"'
"She wants to get a divorce from her husband," said Ned, "a
measure to which I am decidedly opposed. Since my return from
Cuba (for he too had been travelling), I wished to get rid of her, but
she finds my company so entertaining, that it is rather a difficult
matter."              .                /
"And I dare say," said Jonathan, "that you find her's so agree..
able, that you don't wish t~ do any thing of the kind."
Hammersley turned round and whistled a tune, whilst4Jonathan
was thinking of the confidence of husbands, and the faithlesSness ~f

"Holloa, Ned," cried Jonathan, as they were proceeding on their
way down town, "whose beautiful pair of greys are those in that
carriage ?"
"They belong to old Isaiah Gibson, who married a short time
ago, a young and lovely wife; I'll tell you all about it after dinner,"
and the two friends proceeded to flelmonico's, according to appoint.
inent, to regale themselves on the dainties that are usually set be.
fore visitors in that favorite place of resort.
On their way there, Hammereley entertained Jonathan with a
short account of hie travels in Louisiana and Cuba, those tropii~al
climes to which ardent young men are in the habit of repairing, to
admire the mellow complexions' and fair forms of southern ladies.
He had visited Natchitochez on Red River, and seen plantations
on the Washita and the Alabama, and had returned quite a convert
on the important subject of slavery. Like many others, he viewed
the question relatively to the state of the master rather than the
slave; for the latter he had little sympathy, but he envied the power
of the former, and had almost come to the conclusion of selling out
his property in New York~ and emigrating to the South. There is
something alluring in the aspect of southern slavery to a young
man of warm temperament, whose regard for the welfare of his
race is not circumscribed by country or color, but' who views all
alike, as fit objects of his sdicitude and benevolence.
The two entered Delmonico's, where they renewed their friendly
relations over the choice fare and delicious wine, of which they par
took, and after dinner, Hammersley narrated to Jonathan the town
gossip" about old Isaiah Gibson's marriage with Theophilus Olements'
young and lovely daught~r. He began:
"Clarence Fitz Simmons was deeply enamoured of the girl, and

and smiled on him, quite as much for the many virtues he possessed,
as from the fact, that his father was reputed to be 'a man of large
property. Amoinlgst all the girls of his acquaintance, there was none,
who attracted his attention so much as Syporah Clements." (Here
there was a twinge of Jonathan's upper lip, which it Was well Ned
did not notce-he was intent on the narration.) "They took theij

he worshipped in such blind adoration. What was home or the
pl~asnes ofsocial converse in the family circle, where his daughter
was admired and beloved, in comparison with the untold treiisures,
which her connection with Gibson would unlock to him. Syporah
held the golden wand in her hand, and she had only to do her
fa4her's bidding, to ensure her! misery, and his! happiness.
"Fitz Simmons' visits to his house were strictly forbidden, and all
i4trcourse between him and his da~nghter interdicted, un4er pain

follow and track her path, and should he observe her talking to a

"In the meantime, every opportunity was afforded to old Gibson to
visit at the house. His appearance must have been loathsome in
the highest degree, to the tastes and inclinations of a young girl of
seventeen. H~e was, bald-headed, with the exception of a few grey
Iw~rs, which were drawn over his ears, he had an ugly pug-nose, on'
the bridge of which was a large wart, from which three or four
white hairs emerged, his face was red, almost approaching to' a
crimson, his eyes brown, and as for his teeth, the few that ho

been, for in a corner of the large room, in which the company was
received, there sat the poor frail creature, who had been. offered up
as a victim at the shrine of Mammnon. Her pale face and attenuated
form betokened the ravages which consumption was surrepliously
making on her constitution, and she stood there a living picture of
the heart's despair, and a striking example of the brutality of man.
Her days were numbered, and although you saw her this morning
seated ~y the side of her husband in a carriage drawn by those grey
horses, which attracted your attention, all who know her, say, that
she is going fast to her grave.~~
"And what became of Fitz Sii'nmons ?" asked Jonathan.
"He b~ame almost raving mad, and at one time his friends were
about taking him to an asylum. I believe, however, they travelled
with him, and I have not heard of him lately?'
"It's a sad talc," said Jopatlian, "and I dare say there arc many
fathers in this happy country, who sell their daughters for money."
"Yes," replied, Ned, "and Ah good they get of it. Poor
miserable beings, who are like moths, that flicker about a candle,
only leading .to their destruction; wealth is the Ilame which con-
sumes them at last, it lures them, for it is attractive, but it swal.
lows up every noble impulse of virtue and honor."
During the conversation at the dinner table, -Jonathan appeared
wholly absorbed with what Hammnersley was telling him, he had

been too deeply interested himself in the fate of byporah Clements,
not to feel anxious to hear all that concerned her, and when his
friend Ned had finished his sorrowful tale, he was cast into a state
of the deepest reflection. His thoughts wandered to the scenes of
other days, when he considered he had a fair claim to the hand
and heart of the girl he was speaking about. He was repulsed on
account of his poverty; 'the father, said he to himself, will soon have
a good example of the effects of wealth, and the memory of the.
wrongs he has done his child will cling to him, till he follows her to
the grave.
Did a thought again obtrude itself on Jonathan's mind, that had
she married hem, her fate also might have been different? There
did not, for the sadness of the tale which he had heard, chased
away any ideas of a selfish character.
They remained until rather alate hour at Delmonico's, when they
bade each other adieu, and returned to their respective homes.
On the following day, Jonathan accompanied his mother on a
visit to' Mrs Seagrave, who again appeared quite happy oi~ seeihg
her old friends. When she told Mrs Oldbuck, what she had nar.
rated to Jonathan the day~~before, the old woman volunteered he'
services to call en her parents and endeavor to effect a reconciliation
but the young mother begged of her to desist from doing so, as sh~
was not sensible of having offered them any injury, and they should'
be the first to call and see her.
"However wrong I may have been," said Louisa, "in having
married a man against their wishes, I think there should be a 1~ernx
to a parents' displeasure, and I should be the last person in th~
world~ to do violence to my feelings, by making them believe, that I
was a supplant on their' charity. No4 said ~he, I would soone#
toil night and day for the support of my helpless orphans, (for they
have been abandoned by their natural protector) rather than beg fox'
assistance at the hands of those who should be the first to oLThr i\
to me. 'I was a young girl, and may have committed errors, (ane~ ~
here poor Louisa shed again abundant tears) but a father shouk~
never forget his daughter, and we are taught to believe by the pre
c.epts of our holy religion, that repentance can never come'.1;oo late~
it is the bright spot which shows us the errors of the past, and illu
wines our paths for the future."'
Thus spoke the lonely mother, with one babe suckling at he&amp;'
breast, and the other in a oradleiat her feet, and what father who
could look on his child in such a state4 ought not to feel compassion
for her misery, and repent for the wrongs he had done her?
Jonathan and his mother left the young woman with sad reflee..
tions on the severity of fathers, and the errors of children.
On their return home, they found the Spicers waiting for them
in the parlor, for Kitty Spicer, having heard from the 'servant, that

son, thought, as tie would of course return with her,. it would
be a favorable opportunity, to make his acquaintance, and see how.
her charms would work upon him. She was a' tall, ugly looking
girl, with a nose almost as long as the ringlets that fell from her
hair, it was crooked too, but there was something in her eye, which
possessed the powers of attraction, and she wore bracelets with rib-
bons on her long skinny arms, which gave her in 5onathan's opinion
quite a fascinating appearance. Her conversation was lively and
interesting, she had a quick mode of pronouncing her words, which
sounded rather harsh, it was true, and her voice was shriller than
what' Mr Oldbuck might have desired, but had she been "fat,"
besides being "fresh and forty," she would have been a very suit-
able match for one who was rather advanced in years. Jonathan
appeared rather smitten with her charms, and she' took good care to
cast glances "fast and thick" at the object of her attraction. They
fell so thickly around ~him, that the arrows at length pierced his
heart, and he was for the last time, it is to be hoped, a humble sup-
pliant at the feet of Kitty Spicer.
His courtship was not of long duration, for when an old maid
beings to bear such a heavy battery against the heart of an old
bachelor, the citadel is sure to yield, after the storming it has on-
countered. The breach was made, and Jonathan thought there was
no hope of filling it up, but by entering into an alliance, so he pro-
posed marriage, the only mode of putting a stop to tbi~ warfare.
Kitty Spicer accepted him, and he had thus a fair prospect of enter-
ing the hyrneneal state, and becoming a Benedict. Matters pro-
gresssed favorably, and after the usual quantity of sighs, oaths,
and protestations, both parties prepared for an alteration in their
respeotive~~6onditions in life
Old Mrs Oldbuck clapped her hands with joy, when Jonathan
came h~nie and told her, that Kitty Spicer had accepted him, and
immediately began to make preparations for the wedding. Jona-
titan him~eIf was as "happy es man could be," and spent his time be-
tWeen visits to the tailors, and the object of his affections. Kitty
was as kind and affectionate as her nature permitted her, but one day,
as Jonathan *as standing behind tier, while she was looking in the
glass, he thought he detected rather a queer looking expression,
which betokened anger, a' rather, bad feeling on the eve of one's
marriage. He chased away the idea from his mind, thinking it
might only have arisen from dissatisfaction at the fit of a new dress
she was trying on, ~r perhaps that the mirror being dusty, it did
not reflect the' charms of her beautiful! face. The peculiar expres-
sion and contortion of her countenance on that morning haunted
him however in the trying scenes of his after life, and he reproacheal
himself more than once for having overlooked it, and married such
a girl.
The wedding day at length arrived, and it was ushered in with

all due solemnities and forms. Carriages were sent to the residence
ot~M:rs Spicer, and the happy bride and bridegroom proceeded to
t~huroh, where the knot was tied, the Register of Church, iii
this City, showing, that on the day of March, 185-., Jona-
th~n Oldbuck, Esquire, was 'lawfull~? joined in the holy bands of
matrimony, with Catherine Spicer, both of New York.

happy period in life. Jonathan told his mother, that the measure

tI~he newly married couple hired a house in East Broadway, where

and tastes, he no longer keeps late hours, but settles down as a.

and every name she could put her tongue to. She was in such

"~ ~toiiathan, my boy," said Mrs Oldbuck,' "this will never answer,

made him lose his equilibrium. "He does every thing to annoy

sooner got out of the house, than she (pointing to Kitty) said I was
ruining her, that Mr Wilkins would never call again, because I had
insulted him by lcaviiig the room and going up stairs to road the
newspapers, that all her old friends were one after the other desert-
ing her, and that I was the cause of it."
"It's ~ said Kitty, and drawing ~er chair near Mrs Oldbuok, ~
began telling her ~vhat she said was the truth and nothing but the
truth, that after Mr Wilkins left that afternoon, Jonathan pouted
and became so disagreeable 'at the dinner table, that he would not
eat linything, whereupon she reproached him with being attacked
by the green~eyed monster, she was sure he was jealous of Mr
Wilkins,- and that was the reason he wouldn't eat any of the fine..
apple dumplings she had made for dinner.
Jonat~han denied this, but Kitty persisted in saying it was true,
when the mother intervened by observing, "My children, you should
live in peace, I, believe Jonathan is partly wrong, and you must be-
have better for the future," turning to her son, but at the same time
wishing toAonciliate both parties.
"I was going to tell you," said Kitty, "about his trampling o~i
my dear little poodle this morning."
"Never mi1pd, my child," said Mrs Oldbuok, "never mind, he
will behave better for the future. Kiss and m.~ke friends, my
children."
- Jonathnn looked at Kitty, and Kitty at Jonathan. The latter
w~u1d have purchased peace no matter on what terms, but the

former was inexorable, and her very looks indicated that. she would
not allow him to approach her.
Mrs Oldhuck having remained a short time, and finding a rather
more amicable feeling existing between man and wife, took her
departure, not without Jonathan expressing a wish to see her home,
which his mother would not consent to, saying that bhe would pre-
t'er his staying at home and making up with his wife.
The feud may have been healed for the moment, and a truce
effected, but it could not have been of long duration, for there was
evidently no congeniality between the tastes or feelings, and what
was far worse, between the tempers of Jonathan and Kitty. The
latter bore weapons about her person, in the shape of long pointed
n~ils on her fingers, which kept him in dread of her, and he was
~cry cautious how he gave her offence.
At length the storm burst out with renewed fury, the quarrel
arose from a trifling incident, but as ~great events proceed from
slight causes, it was attended this time by the most serious con.
- sequences.
Jonathan found fault with Kitty because there was no meat on
the snpper-table, he-ordered the servant to bring ~om~ from the
cupboard, Kitty said she should not do so, as- there was enough to
-eat on the table. Jonathan said sire should, but ~Wy's orders
were paramount with the servant maid, so Jonathan went dowa*
himself to the cupboard to get the meat, and on' coming up
stairs, his foot slipped, and the dish was broken to pieces.
Kitty raved like a maniac, when she found her best stone china
dish broken to atoms, she called her husband the vilest names she
could tnink of, and he stood gaping at the mischief he had done,
and thinking how utterly un~.bie he was to repair it. As Kitty
entered the room with a piece of the broken dish in her hand, she
found Jonathan standing at the door, and she gave hltn such a blow
on his cheek, that he cried out "murder." To prevent any further
mischief he caught hold of one of Kitty's hands, when she began to
scratch his face with, the other, and both being soon released and
in full play, she flew at him like a tigress, whilst he was holloa-
ing out "murder" at the top of his voice.
The police burst into the house, and found Jonathan in, a. sad
plight, his face was dreadfully bruised, and the blood streaming
down it; he had not yet ceased to get over his fright, for he really
believed the -woman intended to murder him. Mr ~, one of
our .mQst worthy and efficient police officers, finding it was nothing
but a quarrel between man and wife, and having considerable ex-
perience in such matters, suggested the best remedy against a repe-
tition of such scenes, by a separation for the night, if not for ever!
"For ever," cried Jonathan, "in God's name; I cannot live with
the woman, and I ~hall apply for a divorce to-morrow ;" saying this,
-he accompanied the officer as far as hi~ mother's residence. On the

"Procrastination 'is the thief of time," as Jonathan Oldbuok
thought, when he was courting Louisa Switzer, Syporah Olernents,
atid Clarissa Shrewsbury, but of ePthe truth of the other' adage,
f' Marry in 'haste and repent at leisure," he was nearly having a
rull !conviction in his amours with Alksrg'uerite Gerbots, and cer~
tainly 'received striking' proofs in the case of Kitty Spic~r.
"Make no more haste than speed," is the safest rule to go by,
for if Jonathan had shown less anxiety to contract marriage in the
earlier period 'of his life, and taken more time to win the affections
the ladies he loved, he might not have been obliged to marry a
shrew in his old age. He was too importunate in his amours, and
to 'that cause may be attributed the little success he met with in
his relations with the fair sex.
"Weijlth does not always confer happiness," is the other moral
that can be drawn from a perusal of tb, preceding' pagos, and
whilst virtue may take up its abode in the lowly dwellings of the
~poor, it is not always found in the palaces oI the rich.
